Hugs, Heloise\n\n10 days, hepcats.\n\nDays 'til Daylight Saving Time kicks in:Days 'til the Mid-Atlantic Jazz Festival in Rockland, Maryland:Drop in the number of the chronically-homeless since 2010:(Source: AP)Date on which applications will start being accepted for deportation relief as part of President Obama's immigration executive order:The last year the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index was as high as it is today (98.1):Number of people who watched the Patriots win Super Bowl XXXVVVIIII:Rank of the Budweiser \"puppy meets demon sheep\" ad on USA Today's Super Bowl ad meter this year:\n\n-\n\nMid-week Rapture Index: 179 (including 4 Apostasies and a bunch of nimrods who think they can prevent God from destroying America by yelling really loud). Soul Protection Factor 8 lotion is recommended if you\u2019ll be walking amongst the heathen today.\n\n-\n\nPuppy Pic of the Day: Here's today's puppy care tip: don't throw your puppy out of a car into a snow bank. Apparently some idiot hasn't learned this yet.\n\n-\n\nCHEERS to a ringing endorsement. You can tell a budget's worth by putting it through the junior senator from Vermont's Bernietron 5000. This week President Obama unveiled his fiscal road map for America, and Senator Sanders---the new ranking member on the Budget Committee (woo hoo!) and a tough critic---has rendered his verdict in USA Today:\n\n\n\nHappy Bernie! [T]he president's proposal to increase funding for infrastructure will make our country more productive and safer. It will also create millions of good jobs. \u2026 [T]he president's plan to make the first two years of community college free is an important step forward in making college accessible for working class families. \u2026 [T]he president's effort to end egregious corporate tax loopholes while providing tax breaks for working families is movement in the right direction.\n\nExcellent buy-in from a real socialist liberal. Now we wait to hear the response from the Republicans. Spoiler alert: it will be remarkably similar to the sound of a\n\nCHEERS to escorting the clock down the aisle to the altar. Here's something to tickle Justice Roy Moore's morality bone down in crawdad country. A federal judge in the 11th Circuit has rejected the extension of a stay on her marriage ruling, which means the clock is ticking down the remaining 5 days before gay couples can get hitched in the great state of Alabama:\n\n\n\nEquality Alabama Board Chairman Ben Cooper said today:\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hiya!!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nSame-sex marriage will introduce a new and exciting concept to Alabama: the shotgun-less wedding.to #1. On February 4, 1789, George Washington---whom today's right-wingers would despise because he preferred bowing to shaking hands---clinched the presidency with 69 electoral votes. Upon hearing the news, he said his feelings were \"...not unlike those of a culprit who is going to the place of his execution.\" His first official act: providing all Americans equal access to quality mattresses at low, low discount prices, a February tradition that lives on to this day.\n\nJEERS to the random mumblings of Governor Footinmouth. Last night Maine got its annual \"state of the state\" address, that magical eight uninterrupted hours when our Teapublican governor, Paul LePage, rhetorically straggles through all the hard-line conservative talking points and then proclaims, \"The state of our state is\u2026meh, it's too good for you moochers, that's for sure.\" The speech was punctuated by occasional smatterings of perfunctory applause. But he did say one thing that earned him a well-deserved standing ovation. I believe it was, \"In conclusion...\"\n\nCHEERS to making the world safe for sexytime. The guy who co-invented the Pill is dead at 91:\n\n\n\nEqually admired by\n\nwomen and men.\n\n- Aside from his contributions to the Pill, Mr. Djerassi was known among chemists for his work with antihistamines and topical corticosteroids, and for his interest in applying computer modeling and measurement techniques to the field of organic chemistry. He also won the National Medal of Technology for his work in insect control at Zoecon, a company he founded in Palo Alto.\n\nIn his honor, today all orgasms will be lowered to half intensity.\n\nCHEERS to the gift that just kept on giving. Happy birthday to former Vice President Dan Quayle, who turns 68 today. He certainly wasn't an evil vice president like Dick Cheney, but I still want to see him tried in the International Criminal Court for torturing the English language:\n\n\n\nIf we don't succeed we run the risk of failure. For NASA, space is still a high priority. I love California, I practically grew up in Phoenix. What a waste it is to lose one's mind. Or not to have a mind is being very wasteful. How true that is.\n\nYou\u2019re still no Jack Kennedy, Dan. But you're also not your idiot son who said in a campaign ad that Barack Obama was the worst president in history and then got booted after one sorry term in Congress. So for today only---in honor of the occasion and for all the laughter ya brung us---we'll let potato have an e.\n\n-\n\nTen years ago in C&J: February 4, 2005\n\nCHEERS to Cojones de la Burro. 36 Democrats (plus Independent Jim Jeffords) said \"Um...thank you but no\" to Senate confirmation of Alberto Gonzales as Torture Tsar, aka Attorney General. And to the six Dems who voted for him: you'll find \"conscience\" on page 170 of the Merriam Webster Dictionary. [2/4/15 Update: The Democrat senators who voted for Gonzales: Lieberman, Landrieu, Pryor, Bill Nelson, Ben Nelson and Ken Salazar. Meanwhile, Gonzales now teaches constitutional law in Nashville. I have no words\u2026]\n\n-\n\nAnd just one more\u2026\n\nJEERS to shoving America into the wayback machine. We like to joke that Republicans want to send us back to the 1950s. But when it comes to vaccinations, some on the right---and, sadly, far too many on the left---are actually dragging us back to the 1940s. Artist Banksy posted this vintage cartoon from that decade yesterday on twitter:\n\n\n\nIf only there was a vaccine against idiocy.\n\nOh, and today is \"Thank A Mail Carrier Day,\" for which we have one word: Newman!!! Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering about today?\n\n-\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE\u2026\n\nToday's Boring Corrections\n\n\u2022 At an Armed Forces Committee hearing, Senator John McCain barks, \"Get out of here, you low-life scum\" as Code Pink members protest ...", "title": "Cheers and Jeers: Wednesday", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/2/4/1361994/-Cheers-and-Jeers-Wednesday", "image": "http://assets.dailykos.com/assets/fb_default-83551080ce5aec223661e373eaf232ea.png", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"site": "@dailykos", "creator": "@billinportland", "description": "From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE\u2026\nToday's Boring Corrections\n\u2022 At an Armed Forces Committee hearing, Senator John McCain barks, \"Get out of here, you low-life scum\" as Code Pink members protest the ap...", "card": "summary", "title": "Cheers and Jeers: Wednesday"}}, "article_summary": "Cheers and Jeers for Wednesday, February 4, 2015Note: To avoid cabin fever, don\u2019t live in a cabin.\n-Puppy Pic of the Day: Here's today's puppy care tip: don't throw your puppy out of a car into a snow bank.\nCHEERS to the gift that just kept on giving.\n-CHEERS to a ringing endorsement.\nJEERS to the random mumblings of Governor Footinmouth."}
