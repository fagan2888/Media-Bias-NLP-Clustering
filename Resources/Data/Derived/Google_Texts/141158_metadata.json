(AP) - Their priorities aren\u2019t much different - lift New Mexico from the bottom of the nation\u2019s education rankings, keep the state\u2019s children safe and find a way to boost economic development and job creation.\n\nThe best route for accomplishing those goals is what Republican Gov. Susana Martinez and the state Legislature will be hashing out when the 60-day session begins Tuesday.\n\nEfforts to stop the state from issuing driver\u2019s licenses to immigrants in the country illegally and right-to-work legislation are also expected to pepper the debate since the session isn\u2019t limited to just the budget and taxes.\n\nMartinez and lawmakers also will be wading into an unfamiliar political landscape this year. Despite reassurances of bipartisanship from both sides of the aisle, the dynamics in the Roundhouse will be different this year since Republicans now hold the majority in the House of Representatives, something the state hasn\u2019t seen in 60 years.\n\nIncoming New Mexico House Speaker Don Tripp, R-Socorro, said he looked forward to working with Democrats, who still control the Senate, on ideas to push economic development and creating an environment to attract more businesses.\n\nSome are speculating the GOP-led House will be a rubber stamp for the governor\u2019s initiatives, but Rep. Larry Larranaga, an Albuquerque Republican and member of the powerful Legislative Finance Committee, said not much is going to change.\n\n\u201cWe know what the numbers are. We know what the issues are. We know what the needs are. It\u2019s not new,\u201d he said during a recent budget news conference. \u201cJust because the Republicans have taken over the House, that\u2019s not like saying this state is going to be turned upside down.\u201d\n\nBy controlling the House, Republicans will be able to advance measures that have been blocked for years by Democrats. Still, the Senate could pose a roadblock.\n\n\u201cOn the Senate side, we\u2019ve debated and we\u2019ve brought out the issues, and I see the same thing happening this year,\u201d said Sen. Howie Morales, D-Silver City. \u201cThere are things we\u2019re not going to agree on, but that\u2019s just part of the process.\u201d\n\nMorales is among the lawmakers who have acknowledged heading into the session that priorities will have to be set given that oil prices are continuing to fall, slashing the amount of new money the Legislature and governor will have to work with as they craft the state budget for the next year.\n\nBoth the Legislature and Martinez have proposed spending plans of nearly $6.3 billion, a slight increase over last year, with the largest chunk going toward education.\n\nUnder the governor\u2019s plan, more than $2.7 billion in recurring general funds would be spent on education.\n\nMartinez has proposed putting more money toward expansion of the school year for kindergarten through third-grade students as part of an effort to close the achievement gap in literacy and math. More than $11 million would go toward raising the starting salary for new teachers by $2,000 and creating a classroom supply fund for teachers and mentorship programs to improve low-performing schools.\n\nMartinez\u2019s plan to end social promotion in New Mexico schools still faces opposition from Senate Majority Leader Michael Sanchez, who says student retention should be based on teachers\u2019 assessments, not reading test scores.\n\nLawmakers also expect to debate the finer points of funding education, with some targeting the governor\u2019s efforts to funnel money to specific overhauls rather than to school districts through a funding formula.\n\nNumerous bills aimed at preventing child abuse and bolstering social services for families have also been introduced.\n\nDemocrats will again propose increases in the state\u2019s minimum wage, and Republicans plan to push to make New Mexico a right-to-work state, which would bar private- and public-sector workers from being required to join unions as a condition for employment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Their priorities aren't much different - lift New Mexico from the bottom of the nation's education rankings, keep the state's children safe and find a way to boost economic development and job creation.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Their priorities aren\u2019t much different - lift New Mexico from the bottom of the nation\u2019s education rankings, keep the state\u2019s children safe and find a way to boost economic development and job creation.", "title": "New Mexico Legislature meeting as political landscape shifts", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/17/new-mexico-lawmakers-convene-as-political-landscap/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/17/a4a83c01bf747e026b0f6a706700d492.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/17/a4a83c01bf747e026b0f6a706700d492.jpg", "description": "Their priorities aren't much different - lift New Mexico from the bottom of the nation's education rankings, keep the state's children safe and find a way to boost economic development and job creatio", "card": "summary", "title": "New Mexico Legislature meeting as political landscape shifts"}, "Author": "SUSAN MONTOYA BRYAN", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Susana Martinez and the state Legislature will be hashing out when the 60-day session begins Tuesday.\nMartinez and lawmakers also will be wading into an unfamiliar political landscape this year.\nIncoming New Mexico House Speaker Don Tripp, R-Socorro, said he looked forward to working with Democrats, who still control the Senate, on ideas to push economic development and creating an environment to attract more businesses.\nBoth the Legislature and Martinez have proposed spending plans of nearly $6.3 billion, a slight increase over last year, with the largest chunk going toward education.\nNumerous bills aimed at preventing child abuse and bolstering social services for families have also been introduced."}
