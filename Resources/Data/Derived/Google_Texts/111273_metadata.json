When she allegedly became combative on the side of the road, she was arrested on charges of assaulting a public servant.\n\nAfter spending the weekend in jail, she was discovered dead on Monday morning from what the Waller County Sheriff\u2019s office said \u201cappears to be self-inflicted asphyxiation\u201d \u2014 death by hanging.\n\nThe incident was reported in local press at the time, but it was only on July 16 when a video was released, bringing Bland\u2019s story to national and international attention. Filmed by a bystander, Bland can be heard saying to the officer restraining her: \u201cYou just slammed my head into the ground. Do you not even care about that?\u201d Another officer repeatedly tells the man with the recording device that he \u201cneeds to leave,\u201d before Bland thanks him for recording the incident and is led away in handcuffs.\n\nBland was excited about her new job in student outreach at her alma mater, Prairie View A&M University. The job would have started Wednesday. Bland was also an outspoken civil rights advocate who frequently posted on social media about police brutality and the #BlackLivesMatter movement.\n\nJust how many times has this happened before, when there was no one around with a cell phone to capture such brutality on video?\n\nIf you feel strongly that we need to uncover the truth about this incident, please sign my petition demanding a full investigation into the death of Sandra Bland.\n\nJonathan Sanders\n\nAnother death after an altercation with a police officer. This happened last week, on July 8, but more details about it are emerging this week.\n\nThe Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is stepping in to investigate an incident in Clarke County where an unarmed black man was killed in a physical struggle with a police officer.\n\nThirty-nine-year-old Jonathan Sanders suffered \u201csome kind of asphyxiation\u201d during an altercation with white officer Kevin Harrington on July 8, in the small town of Stonewall, in the eastern part of the state, said attorney J. Stewart Parrish.\n\nParrish told local media outlets that Harrington pulled Sanders from a horse and choked him to death with a flashlight. Stonewall Police Chief Michael Street denied the details of the attorney\u2019s allegations. According to Street, the two men engaged in a fight without weapons after Sanders voluntarily stepped down from a horse-drawn buggy.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t really give out any particulars to it because it is an ongoing investigation. I can say that we\u2019ve always had a good relation with the community, and we continue to do that,\u201d Street said.\n\nWe await the results of an autopsy, but meanwhile, according to the Guardian, as of this writing 165 black people have been killed by the police in the U.S. so far this year.\n\nEric Garner\n\nIn more positive news, the city of New York has announced a $5.9 million settlement with the family of Eric Garner, killed on July 17, 2014, due to a banned police chokehold during an arrest for selling loose cigarettes.\n\nGarner\u2019s death was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner, but a grand jury declined to indict the officer on criminal charges. After the grand jury\u2019s decision, the family announced its intention to file a wrongful death lawsuit, seeking $75 million in damages.\n\nDuring a press conference on July 14 in Harlem, the family assured the public that it will continue to work for changes in the criminal justice system and cautioned the public against viewing the settlement deal in too favorable of terms.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t congratulate us,\u201d said Gwen Carr, the mother of Mr. Garner. \u201cThis is not a victory.\u201d\n\nBut the settlement is a start, albeit just a tiny start, a hope that justice will be served in the midst of so much injustice.\n\nSerena Williams\n\nFile this one under racism and sexism.\n\nLast weekend, Serena Williams, the women\u2019s world No 1 tennis player and holder of 21 grand slam titles, won her sixth Wimbledon \u2013 a truly amazing feat. However, it didn\u2019t take long for David Frum, senior editor of the Atlantic, to send tweets implying that Williams uses steroids, something that has been disproved numerous times in the past. Frum later deleted his tweets.\n\nThen came the attacks on her body. One tweeter stated that Williams\u2019 win was down to her being \u201cbuilt like a man\ufffd,\u201d which drew the wrath of J.K. Rowling. The author cleverly responded with a picture of Williams in a red dress and the message:\n\n\u201cYeah, my husband looks just like this in a dress. You\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\n\nBut even before Williams won her 6th Wimbledon, a New York Times article about the body image of female tennis players unleashed a furious debate about the racist and sexist ways in which the media discusses Serena Williams\u2019 body. In it, Ben Rothenberg interviewed Williams and some of her peers about what female athletes \u201cshould\u201d look like. \u201cI\u2019m really happy with my body type, and I\u2019m really proud of it,\u201d said Williams.\n\nEnd of conversation.
