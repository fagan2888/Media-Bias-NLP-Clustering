Pierre, SD

The airport in South Dakota's capital is unlikely to reach the 10,000-passenger threshold needed to be eligible for $1 million in federal funding.



The airport in Pierre saw 1,023 boardings in November, putting this year's passenger total at 8,502. November was the second time in 2014 that monthly enplanements exceeded 1,000.



The federal funds are meant to be used on airport improvements.



Pierre's passenger boardings have been hampered by canceled flights from Great Lakes Airlines, which has struggled at times to meet the new federal regulations.



Pierre Regional Airport Manager Mike Isaacs says the city could count passengers flying on private charter flights in an effort to reach the threshold. But even then, Isaacs says, reaching 10,000 passengers seems unlikely.



Officials could ask for a threshold waiver.
