STEWART ISLAND, New Zealand (AP) — Britain’s Prince Harry told schoolchildren Monday on a remote New Zealand island that his favorite food is spaghetti Bolognese, he calls Queen Elizabeth II “granny” and he wishes he could speak other languages.

The Prince visited Halfmoon Bay School on the third day of a weeklong tour of the South Pacific nation and answered some tricky questions posed by the children. The primary school has 24 students and is the only one on Stewart Island, population 378.

The visit came the morning after Harry deviated from his official program by attending a quiz night at the island’s only bar, the South Sea Hotel. His team, called “The Ginger Ninjas” in a nod to his red hair, finished second to a team comprised of his own bodyguards, according to British newspaper The Telegraph.

At the school, Harry sat in on an introductory German class. He apologized for not speaking the language, adding that he’d learned some French at school, which he’d mostly forgotten, and he’d love to learn Spanish.
