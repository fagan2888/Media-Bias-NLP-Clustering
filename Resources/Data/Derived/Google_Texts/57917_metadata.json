Burwell, Healthcare Reform, Hlabig, king v. burwell, michael cannon, Obamacare, superman, Vox.com, Politics News\n\nAny avid reader of comic books is familiar with the concept of retroactive continuity. Comic book writers who want to explore new concepts and story lines for existing characters often find themselves constrained by the character\u2019s established history. The way they get around this is to go back into a character\u2019s past and insert or change certain key facts. The most well-known use (or abuse) of retroactive continuity is the surprise resurrection of popular characters who \u201cdied.\u201d Sometimes \u201cretconning,\u201d as the process is commonly known, can be used to create absurdly elaborate back stories for new characters. The whole purpose of retconning is to manufacture a narrative and graft it onto the established history, making it seem like the writer\u2019s surprising new twist isn\u2019t just plausible, but justified.\n\nThat\u2019s fine when all you have in mind is selling a few more Captain America comics. It gets a bit dicier when you try to retcon the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance subsidies out of existence.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what Michael Cannon is trying to do. Cannon is the legal mastermind behind the Halbig and King cases that challenge the legality of the tax credits made available through the federal health exchanges. He argues that the drafters of the legislation intended for those subsidies to be withheld from states that didn\u2019t set up their own exchanges, and wrote the bill in such a way to reflect that intention.\n\nVox\u2019s Sarah Kliff interviewed Cannon and asked him how he can believe this, given that no one who covered the law\u2019s drafting has any recollection of ever hearing this argument, and the people who drafted the law say it was never their intention to deny subsidies to any state. Cannon argued that his position is \u201cperfectly reasonable,\u201d and tried to explain why:\n\nWhat was happening here was, the senators and staff who wrote this language were just trying to put something together that would get 60 votes, so that they could go to conference with the House. To get 60 votes, they needed to create the expectation that states would be running the exchanges. That was crucial to get to 60 votes. It seems perfectly reasonable to me that some senators or staffers would then say, \u201cWell, we\u2019ll offer the subsidies only in exchanges established by the state. That will create the necessary incentive for states to do it.\u201d And there are lots of reasons why they wouldn\u2019t even discuss it. They may have believed it\u2019s not worth mentioning because all states would establish exchanges even without the incentive. Or it\u2019s not worth mentioning because they figured this provision isn\u2019t going survive conference.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Did Congress intend to withhold Obamacare subsidies?
