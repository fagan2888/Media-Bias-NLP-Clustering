He loaded trucks at night and studied business during the day at Delta State University in Cleveland, Miss. He needed the job: A scholarship covered his tuition but not dates with his high school sweetheart.\n\nAbney, the first in his family to attend college, couldn\u2019t afford to live on campus. He often skipped the 45-minute commute home and slept on couches in the school\u2019s union \u2014 the portrait of a scrappy dreamer, his friends say.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018One day, we\u2019re going to bronze one of those couches and present it to you,\u201d said Keith Fulcher, executive director of Delta\u2019s alumni association. \u201cThis is where it all started. On the couches. Right here.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Abney was named the next chief executive of UPS, the world\u2019s largest package delivery company, succeeding D. Scott Davis on Sept. 1. \u201cThe company has provided me tremendous opportunity, amazing career experiences and rewarding professional development,\u201d Abney, 58, said in a statement. He was not available for an interview Friday.\n\nHis storybook ascension, from minimum wage to millionaire, has precedent. Former McDonald\u2019s chief executive James Skinner started his career as a restaurant manager trainee. Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon\u2019s first job was unloading trucks at an Arkansas distribution center. General Motors chief Mary T. Barra joined the company as an 18-year-old intern.\n\nRelated: At GM, Heads Roll As Company Works to Make Amends\n\nThat\u2019s happening less and less in America, but experts say it shouldn\u2019t. Internal mobility began to decline as unions lost power in the 1980s and \u201990s, said Matthew Bidwell, who teaches management at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business. People started hopping around more.\n\nThat\u2019s not good for business, according to a study he published in 2011.\n\n\u201cIt can take years to understand how a company works, to understand the culture,\u201d Bidwell said. \u201cYou build the relationships you need. You gain connections inside the company to get things done.\u201d\n\nPromoting internally is also cheaper, Bidwell said. Companies tend to spend more on new hires. \u201cSo, now, we\u2019re seeing more companies starting to talk about How do we increase internal mobility? A strong company culture, I think, is one answer.\u201d\n\nRelated: UPS to Remove Scores of Spouses from Medical Plan\n\nThe culture of internal promotion remains strong at UPS. Dan McMackin, a 53-year-old UPS spokesman in Atlanta, started loading trucks for the company in high school. He held on to his part-time job, graduated college and began driving routes in Wisconsin, bagging a $60,000 salary.\n\n\u201cI saw that the bulk of the management folks here came from within,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s atypical not to. And that\u2019s inspiring. We have such deep bench strength because employees are nurtured from Day One.\u201d\n\nAbney, McMackin said, is a shining example. \u201cHe had such a rich tapestry of experiences. He always had support.\u201d\n\nAfter graduating from Delta in 1976, Abney became a package car driver for UPS in west Mississippi. He married his high school sweetheart, Sherry. He became a manager.\n\n\u201cThe more I learned about UPS\u2019s business, the more intrigued I became by the fast-paced discipline against [the] deadline nature of it,\u201d he told the school\u2019s alumni magazine in 2007. \u201cIt required a lot of organization skills and teamwork, and that appealed to me.\u201d\n\nRelated: 7 Ways to Fix Your Biggest Management Mistake\n\nAbney took jobs in Tennessee, New Jersey and Arizona before becoming head of the company\u2019s international operations. He traveled the world, started hosting an annual global business symposium at his alma mater and, in 2007, became chief operating officer.\n\n\u201cHe wanted kids in the Delta to rub elbows with business leaders and see the possibilities for their own careers,\u201d said Fulcher, who met Abney 14 years ago. \u201cHe told them: You have to work hard. You have to put in extra hours. That\u2019s what it takes to get what you want in life.\u201d\n\nJeff Rosensweig, an associate professor of international business and finance at Emory University, invited Abney to lead a class with his MBA students. They became friends, bonding over Elvis Presley. \u201cOne of David\u2019s many admirable traits is that success has never gone to his head,\u201d Rosensweig said. \u201cHis mixes his deep breadth of knowledge with this humility. He has no plans to leave his roots behind him.\u201d\n\nThe newly crowned chief executive\u2019s biggest hobby, Fulcher said, lines the walls of his Georgia home. He collects autographed portraits of Mississippi athletes who made it to the professional leagues. (His favorite: Dave \u201cBoo\u201d Ferriss, who played for the Red Sox and returned to the Delta to coach.) Abney admires folks who start with nothing and climb.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Washington Post.\n\nRead more at The Washington Post:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "David Abney started working for UPS 40 years ago, part time.", "title": "UPS Chief: From Minimum Wage to Millionaire", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/07/UPS-Chief-Minimum-Wage-Millionaire", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05292012_Board_Meeting_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/07/UPS-Chief-Minimum-Wage-Millionaire", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/05292012_Board_Meeting_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "David Abney started working for UPS 40 years ago, part time.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8539\"", "article_summary": "David Abney started working for UPS 40 years ago, part time.\nRight here.\u201dOn Friday, Abney was named the next chief executive of UPS, the world\u2019s largest package delivery company, succeeding D.
