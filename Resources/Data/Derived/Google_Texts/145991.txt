Primus Capital announced an investment in Mandeville, La.-based Netchex Online, a provider of cloud-based payroll, human resources and benefits software.



Terms of the investment were not disclosed.



Netchex uses an SaaS-based platform to create tools used for recruiting staff, managing paperless onboarding procedures, tracking labor costs and managing benefits, payroll and tax.



Primus’ growth investment should bolster the breadth and depth of services for Netchex, which was founded in 2003 by CEO Will Boudreaux and partner Stuart Ethridge. Since its inception, the business has grown to service more than 2,500 employers across the United States, according to a news release, with a predominant focus on the Southeast.



The investment makes sense for Primus as Netchex is considered to be in a high-growth industry.



"As the competition for talent continues to accelerate and the regulatory environment gets more complex, employers increasingly desire integrated human capital management systems," said Primus managing director Jonathan Dick in the release. "Netchex offers a complete solution including compliance with the Affordable Care Act to medium and small businesses that historically was only available for very large corporations.”



“As we conducted our due diligence, we were impressed by the business model, the market opportunity and breadth of the product offering, all of which position the company to grow at accelerated rates and build on its market position as an innovator," added Primus principal Aaron Davis.



With the investment, Boudreaux will remain CEO, but Davis, Dick and Primus operating partner Donald Taylor will join the board of directors.



Primus, which has offices in Cleveland and Atlanta, is a private equity firm investing in growing companies in health care, software, technology-enabled services and education industries.
