Such is the conceit of Edan Lepucki\u2019s \u201cCalifornia,\u201d a novel set roughly 40 years from now in an irredeemably bleak future. But protagonist Frida Ellis doesn\u2019t call the machine that she stows away with her other precious belongings a \u201csmartphone\u201d and it bears no identifying brand. She refers to it only as the \u201cDevice,\u201d an act of naming that reeks of ritual incantation. The Devices in \u201cCalifornia\u201d no longer help Frida and the rest of struggling humanity communicate, but they still provide a link to what came before.\n\nThe non-functionality of the Device serves in sharp distinction to the role played by a similar smartphone doppelg\u00e4nger \u2014 dubbed the \u201cNode\u201d \u2014 in another recent dark tale of the near future, David Shafer\u2019s \u201cWhiskey Tango Foxtrot.\u201d In \u201cWTF,\u201d the Node is the delivery vehicle for a different kind of apocalypse, a means by which a dread cabal of industrialists, software tycoons, security contractors and spies aim to achieve total information control over society. The Node is a really killer iPhone. You literally cannot live without it.\n\nTake your pick: smartphone as relic, like the shinbone of some Dark Ages saint, or smartphone as shackle. But either way, there\u2019s no escape. The science fiction writer William Gibson told me many years ago that his cyberpunk dystopias should always be read as commentaries on the present. No wonder this summer\u2019s wild tales of doom can\u2019t let the smartphone go. If the present cannot be conceived without the smartphone than neither can the future.\n\nBut why such gloom? Dystopian visions have always been a science fiction staple, but the current foul harvest is hard to square with, say, the enthusiasm sure to greet the iPhone 6 or the ebullience that pours out of Silicon Valley every day, burbling like an uncapped fire hydrant. Presumably, the smartphone has achieved near-ubiquitous adoption because it is useful and makes our lives better \u2014 or at least more convenient. Depending on their degree of libertarian utopianism, today\u2019s tech moguls, from Jeff Bezos to Sergey Brin to Mark Zuckerberg, profess profound faith that our new networked technologies will help us fix a broken world, and liberate us all from oppression.\n\nAnd yet, here is \u201cCalifornia,\u201d a future where everything is broken. And here is \u201cWhiskey Tango Foxtrot,\u201d a future where the smartphone is the final instrument of totalitarian oppression. The two strains of dysfunction are quite different. In \u201cCalifornia\u201d nothing works. In \u201cWTF\u201d everything works too well. But both books speak to a deep unease about the present moment, a sense that despite all our amazing technological progress, something is wrong.\n\nSo what\u2019s the problem?\n\n* * *\n\nAge of wonders: \"Surgeons implanted 3D-printed vertebra replacement in a young boy with bone cancer.\" http://t.co/ywcNvZJ08j ht @david_sheff \u2014 Marc Andreessen (@pmarca) August 23, 2014\n\nWhile reading \u201cCalifornia\u201d and \u201cWhiskey Tango Foxtrot\u201d back to back last week, I amused myself by imagining the anger and frustration the books would inspire in Marc Andreessen, the venture capitalist who has become one of the most forceful rhetoricians of Silicon Valley triumphalism. It wouldn\u2019t be long, I reckoned, before Andreeseen was hurling \u201cCalifornia\u201d at the wall. (WARNING: Do not try this with a Kindle!)\n\nEdan Lepucki\u2019s California doesn\u2019t look anything at all like Marc Andreessen\u2019s California. Even worse, there\u2019s no real explanation of why society collapses in the book. Some combination of climate change-induced weather disasters, horrific earthquakes, peak-oil fossil-fuel depletion, and increasing polarization between the haves and have-nots conspires to mess everything up. In \u201cCalifornia,\u201d the pristine Silver Lake Reservoir in Los Angeles is now a dump.\n\n[T]he homeless, rising in number, often used it a a toilet, and people said corpses were buried under all that trash: the rusted-out carts and car parts, the gutted desktop computers, and the hundreds of plastic bags, porous with holes, swollen with brown rainwater, hanging from orphaned tree branches.\n\nLepucki\u2019s multiple-disaster scenario doesn\u2019t jibe well with Andreessen\u2019s \u201cage of wonders\u201d gospel. It\u2019s a vision of the future in which technology does not get us through the bottleneck of overpopulation and constrained resources, a vision that negates the \u201cprogress\u201d made by the globe since the Industrial Revolution, progress that, as far as Silicon Valley is concerned, is now accelerating at light speed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two acclaimed new books show how our smartphone addiction is changing the way we think about the end of the world", "title": "Pop culture\u2019s newest apocalypse: Visions of a smartphone dystopia", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Two acclaimed new books show how our smartphone addiction is changing the way we think about the end of the world", "title": "Pop culture\u2019s newest apocalypse: Visions of a smartphone dystopia", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/01/pop_cultures_newest_apocalypse_visions_of_a_smartphone_dystopia/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/smartphone_apocalypse.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Two acclaimed new books show how our smartphone addiction is changing the way we think about the end of the world", "title": "Pop culture\u2019s newest apocalypse: Visions of a smartphone dystopia", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/smartphone_apocalypse.jpg", "creator": "@koxinga21", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew Leonard", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Apocalypse, California, David Shafer, Dystopia, Edan Lepucki, Editor's Picks, Pop Culture, smartphones, The Future, The Internet, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "And here is \u201cWhiskey Tango Foxtrot,\u201d a future where the smartphone is the final instrument of totalitarian oppression.\nTake your pick: smartphone as relic, like the shinbone of some Dark Ages saint, or smartphone as shackle.\nPresumably, the smartphone has achieved near-ubiquitous adoption because it is useful and makes our lives better \u2014 or at least more convenient.\nTopics: Apocalypse, California, David Shafer, Dystopia, Edan Lepucki, Editor's Picks, Pop Culture, smartphones, The Future, The Internet, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, Innovation News, Technology News, Entertainment News, NewsEven in a post-apocalyptic dystopia, when the Internet is broken and electricity scarcer than unicorns, the smartphone survives \u2014 albeit only as an unusable brick.\nIf the present cannot be conceived without the smartphone than neither can the future."}
