Kevin Cosby called her \"she who shall be the next president.\"\n\nBuy Photo Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton took the stage at St. Stephen Church in Louisville with Rev. Dr. Kevin Cosby on Sunday morning.

Bernie Sanders and lock up the Democratic nomination prior to the Democratic National Convention at the end of July in Philadelphia. Despite a commanding lead in delegates, Clinton has lost 10 of the last 12 primary elections as Sanders has drawn large and enthusiastic crowds.\n\nBut after her husband, Bill Clinton, carried the state in 1992 and in 1996, and after she handily carried the state in 2008 in the Democratic primary against President Barack Obama, she is facing a surprisingly difficult time dispatching Sanders, who defines himself as a \"democratic socialist.\"\n\nShe made that task even tougher in March when, while speaking at a town hall meeting in Ohio, said she would \"put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\" She later said she the words simply came out wrong, but that didn't help last week when Sanders beat her handily in West Virginia.\n\nClinton was scheduled to visit Fort Mitchell later in the day before a full day of campaigning Monday in Bowling Green, Hopkinsville and then Lexington.\n\nBut in Louisville on Sunday, Clinton, didn't dwell on Sanders.\n\nShe never mentioned him in the churches and only spoke of him once at the Carpenters and Millwrights Training Center when she called for more advanced manufacturing jobs in the United States, including in the auto industry.\n\n\"There is a big difference in this primary campaign between me and my opponent, Bernie Sanders,\" she said. \"I voted to bail out the auto industry, and he was against it. ... I wanted to save those millions of jobs.\"\n\nShe sounded a lot like Sanders, at one point, saying that under her, the federal government would crack down on businesses that don't give employees raises even as shareholders reap higher returns. She said she would improve the Affordable Care Act by reducing the cost of co-pays, premiums and prescription drugs.\n\nInstead, she focused most of her fire on presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, questioning his ability to lead. She said he believes Americans are paid too much, and called his statements about allowing other countries to obtain nuclear weapons \"reckless and risky. ... This is scary and dangerous talk. This is the talk of a loose cannon.\"\n\nFormer Gov. Steve Beshear, who introduced Clinton at the union hall, also used his time to criticize Trump's foreign policy credentials.\n\n\"We live right now in some of the most dangerous times that this world has ever seen,\" Beshear said. \"The threat of nuclear proliferation, terrorists abroad and some at home and that position of Commander in Chief has never been more important than it is right now. You and I know that that the Commander in Chief has to be steady, has to be smart, has to be reasonable and has to be strong. And out of the two people this fall, are you kidding me?\"\n\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share U.S. Congressman John Yarmuth D-Ky. nicknamed the presumptive Republican nominee for president \"Double-Cross Donald.\" Sam Upshaw Jr./The CJ\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/27p0dPQ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Local churches endorsed Hillary Clinton before she talked how's she repair the economy at her Louisville rally today.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Local churches endorsed Hillary Clinton before she talked how's she repair the economy at her Louisville rally today.", "title": "Hillary Clinton makes final push in Kentucky", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/elections/kentucky/2016/05/15/live-updates-hillary-clinton-louisville/84411206/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Local churches endorsed Hillary Clinton before she talked how's she repair the economy at her Louisville rally today.", "title": "Hillary Clinton makes final push in Kentucky", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca54a448def80ac66ed726859a88d1b846502fcb/c=49-0-1049-1000&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/05/15/Louisville/Louisville/635989281885786191-hillary-rally-strupp-23.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/John Yarmuth", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/John Yarmuth", "title": "Hillary Clinton makes final push in Kentucky", "author": "Joseph Gerth", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/politics/elections/kentucky", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1a5c006b9eb3f1f5cf5f1f3d05208b464838ff50/c=109-0-859-1000/local/-/media/2016/05/15/Louisville/Louisville/635989281885786191-hillary-rally-strupp-23.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3372241058b9a4779ffc09229da806df4df54bde/c=49-0-1049-1000/local/-/media/2016/05/15/Louisville/Louisville/635989281885786191-hillary-rally-strupp-23.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/db15718a34770d460f6d7366a393cfcfd5343d1a/c=85-0-1415-1000/local/-/media/2016/05/15/Louisville/Louisville/635989281885786191-hillary-rally-strupp-23.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3b647583f9efeca7b4863dac3177fd6722b3d809/c=0-76-1500-923&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/05/15/Louisville/Louisville/635989281885786191-hillary-rally-strupp-23.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-05-15T18:02:25.590000-04:00", "shorthed": "Hillary Clinton makes final push in Kentucky", "articleid": 84411206, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/66d8767a8d1bafaec8525cb97b691552f1571c1d/c=0-76-1500-923/local/-/media/2016/05/15/Louisville/Louisville/635989281885786191-hillary-rally-strupp-23.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eb1bd09832ecfd0252542d107016a6c9dbb8b6fe/c=95-0-655-1000/local/-/media/2016/05/15/Louisville/Louisville/635989281885786191-hillary-rally-strupp-23.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Hillary in Louisville, Hillary CLinton in Kentucky, Kentucky primary, campaign visit, Hillary campaign visit in Louisville, Hillary in Kentucky,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4652\"", "article_summary": "Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share U.S.\nSkip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Hillary Clinton visits the Union of Carpenters and Millwrights Training Center in Louisville ahead of Tuesday's presidential primary.\nBuy Photo Presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton took the stage at St. Stephen Church in Louisville with Rev.\nMay 15, 2016 (Photo: Alton Strupp/The Courier-Journal)Buy PhotoHillary Clinton tried to shore up support from key Democratic constituencies on Sunday as she began her final push through Kentucky in advance of Tuesday's primary election.\nSteve Beshear, who introduced Clinton at the union hall, also used his time to criticize Trump's foreign policy credentials."}
