Former University of Louisville basketball star Manuel Forrest’s face lit up as he arrived at the gym at Moore Traditional High School.

He joined other Louisville legends Darrell Griffith and Milt Wagner as they started talking basketball during the Healthy Hoops Kentucky Coalition at Moore Traditional High School.

Hundreds of children swarmed the gyms as they participated in nearly a full day of basketball instruction from the stars as well as from members of the University of Louisville women's basketball team and Bellarmine’s men's basketball team. Bellarmine men's basketball head coach Scott Davenport also was on tap.

Forrest talked about playing at Moore, but what he remembers most is his struggle with asthma during his playing days.

“It was really rough,” Forrest said of his days in the Ohio River valley. After college at the University of Louisville, he played professionally in Argentina. “I remember vividly the difference when I was in Argentina. I felt like a new man down there, I could breathe.”

Louisville basketball player Mariya Moore, a sophomore, said she loves participating in the hoops coalition.

"We, the players, love giving back to these kids," she said. "These kids come to some of our games so we love to give back.”
