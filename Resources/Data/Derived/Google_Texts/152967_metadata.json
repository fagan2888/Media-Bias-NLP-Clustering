According to Southwest Art magazine, \u201cAtaumbi defines herself not as a native artist, but as a player in the international contemporary art arena.\u201d\n\nWhen the ribbons were handed out, the Ataumbi-Okuma collaboration took a First Place prize and the Special Award sponsored by Blue Rain Gallery. \"Our criteria: innovative and refined art\u2014something that really struck us as being beautiful, progressive, and technically masterful,\" says the Blue Rain Facebook page. \"This year, we found all of these qualities and MORE in this collaborative jewelry set.\"\n\nPrior to Indian Market, Ataumbi spoke with ICTMN about her general artistic philosophies, and her journey.\n\nYour website is broken down into collections that include \"Ocean,\" \"Pollenators,\" and \"Animals\"\u2014Is nature your inspiration?\n\nI live in the country with an orchard and a vegetable garden, animals, and honeybees, so nature inspires me to blend these organic undertones with geometric modern design. The Pollenator set of pieces took me about five years and I made so many insects over that time, I decided I was done with the birds and the bees and the Ocean concept called out saying, \"choose me.\" Then came categories like Geometric, Mythic, and Visual Arts.\n\nWhat are you trying to accomplish?\n\nI\u2019m not into standard mass-produced pieces, trendy baubles, or ethnic jewelry for tourists, my goal is to create work that strives to embrace contemporary jewelry-making strategies through artistic methodologies different from the traditional design process\u2026different in that the dynamic comes from content rather than tried-and-true designs in traditional forms.\n\nWhere are you, artistically?\n\nI vacillate between a couple of things in my work. I dearly love figurative, but at the same time I also love abstract design, so in my studio at any given time, you\u2019ll find those two different lines simultaneously moving forward. I can\u2019t help myself... that\u2019s the way my Creator made me.\n\nWhat's next for you?\n\nI don\u2019t think of myself as being an expert yet on anything in particular. I\u2019m in my mid-40s now, anticipating another 50 years of creativity, but I\u2019m not quite sure what\u2019s next. However, I am a maker of things, so when I\u2019m not in my studio, I still need to occupy my hands and my mind and have taken up both cooking and sewing. I\u2019m still wrestling with the concept, but I am contemplating making wearable objects, accessories like hats and purses. That may or may not happen however because there are only 24 hours in a day and I do have a viable business to maintain\u2014and making jewelry takes a lot of hours.\n\nAny words of wisdom for aspiring Native artists?\n\nThink for yourself and research everything you\u2019re interested in. Being an artist isn\u2019t just about talent, it\u2019s a skill to be learned. Making a piece\u2014painting, sculpture, or jewelry\u2014shouldn\u2019t be confined to your time at the bench or easel. Some of that time should be spent in understanding the basics of the craft and expanding your horizons.\n\nTo learn mora about Keri Ataumbi, visit ataumbi.com and facebook.com/AtaumbiMetals.
