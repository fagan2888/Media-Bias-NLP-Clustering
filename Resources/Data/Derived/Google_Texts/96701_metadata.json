His most glaring admission was not that dollars are in short supply, but rather that the problems confronting the military \u2013 less money and more commitments as well as shaky readiness \u2013 cannot be addressed through cap-busting war spending alone.\n\nAs Gen. Martin Dempsey told Congress, \u201cwe do have a problem, and I think it will become clear through the fall. And it\u2019s not a problem that we can solve just with OCO, that is to say the operational contingency funds. There\u2019s a base budget issue here too we have to get at.\u201d\n\nThis problem is not new, but it is becoming increasingly pernicious and palpable. Another way to characterize the chairman\u2019s assessment is what the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Clark Murdock calls the \u201cdouble whammy.\u201d This refers to a defense drawdown that is in line with historical standards but one that feels deeper given the decline in purchasing power of each U.S. defense dollar, alongside negative real growth in the budget.\n\n[MORE: Cartoons on Defense Spending]\n\nWhat was truly a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d has turned into a \u201ctriple whammy\u201d as year after year Congress continues to reject Pentagon proposals to slow the rate of growth within the defense budget. Internal defense inflation compounds the budget squeeze by requiring additional trade-offs after many assumptions about spending crash into a brick wall of rejection on Capitol Hill.\n\nUnfortunately, there is an emerging quadruple challenge facing the Defense Department budget to which the chairman alluded. Rebuilding readiness in a hurry costs more than the actual dollar amount harvested when it was cut in the first place to meet budget targets.\n\nFor these reasons and more, this defense drawdown has been unlike any other in modern times. It is modest in percentage and dollar terms \u2013 which temporarily masks its true consequences \u2013 but steeper in practical effect and reduced output.\n\n[SEE: Editorial Cartoons on the Islamic State]\n\nThis means that it costs the Pentagon more to simply tread water financially these days. Rebuilding will cost even more. Any dollar given back to the military at this point is practically half spoken for, before it can even be spent. Policymakers should be clear-eyed about this fiscal reality because money alone cannot solve the Pentagon\u2019s budget woes. Nor will simple inflation-adjusted increases be enough.\n\nThe blue ribbon National Defense Panel offered this blunt warning to politicians: \u201cAmerican military forces will be at high risk to accomplish the Nation\u2019s defense strategy in the near future unless\" recommendations such as repealing the Budget Control Act and passing a readiness supplemental are speedily enacted.\n\nListening to America\u2019s military leadership testify about the options for defeating the Islamic State group this week, it is increasingly clear that these are not tomorrow\u2019s problems. The heightened risk, reduced options, degraded readiness and elongated time to victory are all possible \u2013 and avoidable \u2013 consequences today. Perhaps the reality of U.S. forces returning to Iraq will be enough to reverse course and reinvest in America\u2019s military strength.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "World Report [Opinion]", "title": "Defense Spending Alone Won't Fix Pentagon Woes", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The Department of Defense confronts the 'double whammy' of declining purchasing power and negative real budget growth.", "title": "These Days, Defense Dollars Don't Go As Far&nbsp;", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2014/09/17/defense-spending-alone-wont-fix-pentagon-woes", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/c3/db/17ad743b4f358c5a6461fe506908/140916-hageldempsey-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Defense Spending Alone Won't Fix Pentagon Woes", "description": "The Department of Defense confronts the 'double whammy' of declining purchasing power and negative real budget growth.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Sept. 17, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Mackenzie Eaglen,defense spending,Department of Defense,Pentagon,national security terrorism and the military,picks,World Report [Opinion]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Department of Defense confronts the 'double whammy' of declining purchasing power and negative real budget growth."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd11a9\"", "article_summary": "Expressing what is quickly becoming the mainstream consensus viewpoint, this week the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was the latest to pile on about defense spending shortfalls.\n[MORE: Cartoons on Defense Spending]What was truly a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d has turned into a \u201ctriple whammy\u201d as year after year Congress continues to reject Pentagon proposals to slow the rate of growth within the defense budget.\nUnfortunately, there is an emerging quadruple challenge facing the Defense Department budget to which the chairman alluded.\nInternal defense inflation compounds the budget squeeze by requiring additional trade-offs after many assumptions about spending crash into a brick wall of rejection on Capitol Hill.\nAnd it\u2019s not a problem that we can solve just with OCO, that is to say the operational contingency funds."}
