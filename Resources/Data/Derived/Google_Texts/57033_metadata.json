Tilcon would like to subdivide the property and would give the borough development rights to a portion where affordale housing required under a court order would be built. Tilcon would also like to conduct quarry operations on a portion of the acreage. Tilcon is paying for the planner's report on the AH zone.\n\nThe resolution was adopted at the Jan. 7 Borough Council meeting. Mayor Jonathan Dunleavy said the professional planning fees associated with the drafting of the ordinance will be paid by Tilcon Quarry, which is the contract purchaser of the Meer Tract, also known as Bloomingdale Hill Farms, which was the subject of a Council on Affordable Housing (COAH) builder's remedy lawsuit.\n\nAccording to Dunleavy, because there is a court order to build 360 fair market units and 72 low and moderate income units on the site, Tilcon is willing to subdivide the property and give the borough development rights to meet its court-ordered obligations on a portion of the 175-acre tract located in the southern portion of the borough and known as Federal Hill. The balance of the property would be retained by Tilcon for quarry operations, he said.\n\nDunleavy said the borough wanted to get a planner involved in representing the borough at the beginning of the lengthy process. The borough would eventually look to market the property where it has development rights and sell it to a developer, which will build the units as dictated by Superior Court.\n\nAccording to the borough's contract with Burgis Associates, the firm will act as advisors to the Planning Board and Borough Council in the preparation of an AH Zone. It also will review the borough's existing code and provide recommendations for the preparation of a zoning ordinance amendment by using the draft amendment that was part of the Superior Court Order as its basis. Burgis will then present a draft ordinance for the council's and planning board's consideration and then a final amendment for approval. The fee for the work will not exceed $4,500 and Dunleavy said Tilcon will establish an escrow account to fund the consultant's work.\n\nLast year, Tilcon solicited the borough's opinion about a possible use concept for the Federal Hill tract. The governing body discussed the concept at a June 11 executive session. When the council emerged from that closed session, it adopted a resolution advising Tilcon that the borough was interested in entertaining the concept proposed by Tilcon, but was not bound by the resolution. The preliminary concept Tilcon representatives relayed to borough officials called for the affordable housing portion of the site to be deeded to the borough and the bulk of the property with buffers being used by Tilcon's mining ventures.\n\nAfter the resolution was adopted in June, Dunleavy said he envisioned the unveiling of the concept as the first step in a lengthy process that would include Tilcon completing negotiations with the Meers for the purchase, Tilcon reaching an agreement with the borough, and would likely need approvals from Superior Court.\n\nDunleavy noted that the Meer project is one of the only pre-approved projects in the Highlands preservation area where building is prohibited. Last year, neighboring Wanaque was also approached by Tilcon Pompton Lakes Quarry with a proposal to construct an access road to Union Avenue in Haskell in return for a substantial usage fee. The proposal would require the relocation of Elks Camp Moore and the acquisition of several properties in Haskell adjacent to North Twin Lake.\n\nAccording to an article published in the July 10, 2013 edition of Suburban Trends, Wanaque Borough Administrator Thomas Carroll said that the quarry currently has limited hours of operation because the Broad Street access in Pompton Lakes is located in a residential neighborhood. Tilcon wants the new Haskell access to Union Avenue so it can run a 24-hour operation, which would allow the quarry to secure night paving jobs.\n\nEmail: walshde@northjersey.com", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "The Borough Council adopted a resolution that authorizes Burgis Associates of Westwood to prepare an ordinance that would establish an Affordable Housing (AH) Zone District at Federal Hill.", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "author": "Deborah Walsh", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/affordable-housing-zone-district-planned-for-bloomingdale-1.682794", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com:80/polopoly_fs/1.682795!/fileImage/httpImage/mc-federal-3-011714-st-tif.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Borough Council adopted a resolution that authorizes Burgis Associates of Westwood to prepare an ordinance that would establish an Affordable Housing (AH) Zone District at Federal Hill."}, "title": "Affordable Housing Zone District planned for Bloomingdale", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "DC.creator": "Deborah Walsh", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "Affordable Housing Zone District planned for Bloomingdale"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a44\"", "article_summary": "The Borough Council adopted a resolution that authorizes Burgis Associates of Westwood to prepare an ordinance that would establish an Affordable Housing (AH) Zone District at Federal Hill.\nA planner has been retained to create an Affordable Housing (AH) Zone District on historic Federal Hill.\nAccording to the borough's contract with Burgis Associates, the firm will act as advisors to the Planning Board and Borough Council in the preparation of an AH Zone.\nThe resolution was adopted at the Jan. 7 Borough Council meeting.\nTilcon would like to subdivide the property and would give the borough development rights to a portion where affordale housing required under a court order would be built."}
