The quest for a Triple Crown is upon us — again.

It’s Belmont Stakes Day, Saturday, June 6 at Belmont Park, and already thousands of fans have made their way into the spacious racetrack to see a slice of racing history when American Pharoah attempts to become the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years.

An early-morning rain shower at 6 a.m. may prove to be a good omen for American Pharoah. The colt won the Preakness three weeks ago in the slop and seems to thrive in the rain. The showers have ended, and weather reports for later in the day are calling for clear skies and temperatures in the 70s.
