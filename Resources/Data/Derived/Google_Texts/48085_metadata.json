The original hospitals were able to reduce the rate of falls by 35 percent and falls with injuries by 62 percent.\n\nKaiser Permanente San Diego Medical Center, one of the original participating hospitals, sought to eliminate all falls during its own project, and looked to label each patient as a potential risk on arrival, according to a Hospitals & Health Networks article. Kaiser achieved that goal and completely changed its culture using the toolkit, Leah Apatan, R.N., nurse manager of a surgical and oncology unit at the hospital and clinical lead for its falls project, told the publication.\n\nThe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports that nearly 700,000 to one million patients fall in hospitals each year, leading to complications in 2 percent of hospital stays. Furthermore, CMS will penalize hospitals for not preventing hospital-acquired conditions and \"falls and trauma\" are one of the HACs on the list. Therefore, facilities around the country continue to look for ways to prevent this prevalent problem.\n\nMany of these falls \"result in moderate to severe injuries that can prolong hospital stays and require the patient to undergo additional treatment,\" said Erin DuPree, M.D., vice president and chief medical officer of the Joint Commission Center for Transforming Healthcare, in the statement. Serious injuries, on average, add 6.3 days to a patient's hospital stay and cost about $14,056.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the announcement\n\n- here's more on the tool\n\n- check out the HH&N article\n\nRelated articles\n\nHow teamwork can prevent falls\n\nOhio clinic aims to prevent patient falls in hospitals, homes\n\n5 ways to prevent patient falls\n\nSurveillance cameras help prevent patient falls\n\nHospitals work to cut patient falls and complications\n\nHospitals vs. nurses in battle to prevent patient falls", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new resource could help hospitals significantly reduce the number of\u00a0patients injured from falls\u00a0and save approximately $1 million in costs.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A new resource could help hospitals significantly reduce the number of\u00a0patients injured from falls\u00a0and save approximately $1 million in costs.", "title": "Patient fall prevention: New tool could help hospitals save $1M in costs", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/patient-fall-prevention-new-tool-could-help-hospitals-save-1m-costs/2015-08-13", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,hospital acquired conditions (HACs),Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient falls,patient safety,The Joint Commission", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd2c9\"", "article_summary": "To learn more:- read the announcement- here's more on the tool- check out the HH&N articleRelated articlesHow teamwork can prevent fallsOhio clinic aims to prevent patient falls in hospitals, homes5 ways to prevent patient fallsSurveillance cameras help prevent patient fallsHospitals work to cut patient falls and complicationsHospitals vs. nurses in battle to prevent patient falls\nSerious injuries, on average, add 6.3 days to a patient's hospital stay and cost about $14,056.\nBy Fran Matso LysiakA new resource could help hospitals significantly reduce the number of patients injured from falls and save approximately $1 million.\nTo develop the tool, the center originally worked with seven hospitals to test the fall prevention methodology and then expanded the pilot program to five more healthcare organizations.\nThe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports that nearly 700,000 to one million patients fall in hospitals each year, leading to complications in 2 percent of hospital stays."}
