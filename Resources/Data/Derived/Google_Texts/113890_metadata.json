He said Obama had no business winning given his poor approval ratings and the slow economic recovery.\n\nKrauthammer\u2019s comments came as Romney has been reportedly reaching out to former aides, donors and other supporters in preparation for a third potential White House bid in 2016.\n\nBefore losing to Obama in 2012, Romney lost in the GOP primary in 2008 to Sen. John McCain.\n\nKrauthammer spent most of his 90-minute speech chronicling why he believes Obama has been a bad president, calling him a \u201csocial Democrat,\u201d more akin to the socialist liberals of Europe than traditional America liberals. He said his \u201cradical agenda\u201d has led to him growing entitlements rather than reforming them. And he said Obama\u2019s attempts to legislate through executive orders on immigration reform is both lawless and unconstitutional.\n\nKrauthammer\u2019s speech was the first in the Ringling College Library Association Town Hall lecture series, which helps raise money for Ringling College of Art and Design. Next up in the series could be another strident critic of President Obama: former 2012 Republican Presidential candidate Jon Huntsman Jr. returns to Sarasota on Feb. 2 to be the second speaker in the series.", "article_metadata": {"wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}, "description": "As Mitt Romney makes moves to run for the White House again, one of the nation\u2019s best-known conservative commentators is still lamenting his last defeat.", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f16\"", "article_summary": "Krauthammer said Romney\u2019s private sector experience would have made him a better president than Obama, but that Obama is a better campaigner.\nKrauthammer\u2019s speech was the first in the Ringling College Library Association Town Hall lecture series, which helps raise money for Ringling College of Art and Design.\nSpeaking to more than 1,500 people at the Van Wezel Performing Arts Hall Tuesday, syndicated national columnist Charles Krauthammer said he is convinced Romney would have made a very good president.\n\u201cI think the country would have been far better off if he had been elected,\u201d Krauthammer said at the Ringling College Library Association\u2019s annual Town Hall lecture series.\nBefore losing to Obama in 2012, Romney lost in the GOP primary in 2008 to Sen.
