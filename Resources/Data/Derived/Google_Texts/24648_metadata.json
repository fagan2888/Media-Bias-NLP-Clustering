Though they have maple syrup and sweet potatoes in the recipe, these pancakes aren't too sweet. I imagine they'd be delicious sprinkled with some roasted pecans too.\n\nSweet Potato Pancakes\n\nAdapted from SeriousEats.com\n\n1 1/4 cups mashed sweet potatoes\n\n1/2 cup sour cream\n\n3/4 cup milk\n\n1 large egg\n\n1 1/2 tablespoons maple syrup\n\n2 tablespoon butter\n\n1 cup all-purpose flour\n\n3/4 teaspoon baking powder\n\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda\n\n1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n\nNutmeg and cinnamon to taste. (I skipped the nutmeg because I made these early one morning and I'll admit it, I forgot!).\n\nA note on my sweet mashed sweet potatoes: They included some apple cider, butter, salt and pepper, none of which seemed to make a difference in the final pancake product!\n\nMix together the sweet potatoes, sour cream, milk, egg, maple syrup and melted butter in one bowl. Mix the dry ingredients - flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and spices - in another bowl. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined.\n\nSpray a griddle with non-stick spray or grease it with some butter. Cook the pancakes as you'd normally do until everything is cooked through.\n\nServe with more butter, maple syrup, some toasted pecans or whipped cream. There's sweet potato in there so it can't be all bad for you. Right?\n\nGo Ask Mom features recipes every Friday.
