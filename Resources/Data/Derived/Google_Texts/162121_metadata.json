The two children named in the complaint were 3 and 4 years old at the time of the alleged abuse.\n\nIn addition to Vanwagner, the complaint names Roseville City School District, Assistant Superintendent Jerrold Jorgensen and Preschool Program Coordinator George Rooks for neglecting to report Vanwagner to police sooner. The plaintiffs include Duane and Kimberly Beecham of Roseville, their 4-year-old daughter, and Oliver and Jennifer Vergara of Roseville and their 3-year-old son.\n\nAccording to the complaint filed May 12 with the U.S. District Court\u2019s Eastern District of California, Roseville Police Department opened an investigation on Vanwagner in December 2013, days after Rooks reported Vanwagner to police. However, court documents indicate that several teachers\u2019 aides had started reporting Vanwagner\u2019s abusive conduct to Rooks and Jorgensen as early as September 2013.\n\nIn the police report, investigating officers said they explained to Jorgensen that he needed to notify parents of the victims as soon as possible, and while court documents show that RCSD quickly notified parents of Vanwagner\u2019s students that she had been let go, the district said nothing about the allegations against her.\n\nThe Placer County District Attorney\u2019s office charged Vanwagner in June 2014 with three counts of child abuse but did not notify the parents of that either.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until September 2014 that the parents of students named in the criminal complaint had reason to believe their children were victims of abuse, as they received a protective order explaining that Vanwagner was not allowed to have contact with their children. Still, neither RCSD nor the district attorney\u2019s office would explain the reason for the protective order, so the Beechams and Vergaras hired attorneys. It wasn\u2019t until November 2014 \u2013 a full year after Vanwagner\u2019s termination \u2013 that they finally obtained a copy of the police report detailing the abuse.\n\nOliver Vergara told the Press Tribune that while his son is now in a classroom with Lisa Teal, who is \u201cvery caring, loving and collaborative,\u201d he found it disconcerting that he received almost no concrete information or reason for concern until 10 months after Vanwagner\u2019s termination.\n\nKimberly Beecham said she felt betrayed.\n\n\u201cWe want to get the message out there that this is happening far more often than it should\u2026 It\u2019s just heartbreaking altogether,\u201d she said. \u201c(Parents should) pay close attention and ask as many questions as you can. I grew up in Rocklin, I know this area very well, and I know that Roseville and Rocklin are the best school districts around\u2026 so you think you\u2019re in good hands and they\u2019re guiding you in the right direction\u2026 and it\u2019s a really big blow to our family.\u201d\n\nThe Beechams and Vergaras are represented by the same attorneys prosecuting the child abuse case against Rocklin Unified School District \u2013 Peter Alfert of Hinton, Alfert & Kahn, LLP out of Walnut Creek, and Todd Boley, Zoya Yarnykh and Justin Young of Todd Boley Law out of Alameda. In 2014, Alfert and Boley settled a series of school-based child abuse cases against two school districts in Contra Costa for $17 million.\n\nAlfert told the Press Tribune that cases like these are alarmingly common nationwide, in part because school district employees either don\u2019t understand or don\u2019t fulfill their mandatory duty to report child abuse to police without hesitation.\n\n\u201cWe keep seeing a reluctance on the part of administration of these districts to actually make the mandatory report once they learn of these incidents. They try to keep them quiet rather than take the aggressive action required by the law,\u201d he said. \u201cBetween the lack of training of (teachers\u2019) aides and the reluctance of these districts to report, these things go on and on. They could be stopped\u2026 as soon as they begin if people report it. In this instance, (the RCSD case) could have been stopped two and a half or three months earlier, instead of these children going to school every day being abused for those three months.\u201d\n\nIn an email, RCSD Superintendent Derk Garcia declined to comment beyond stating the following:\n\n\u201cI sincerely apologize. However, I am unable to comment on pending litigation. The preschool teacher in question has not been an employee since November 2013,\u201d the email read. \u201cWe take allegations of mistreatment extremely seriously and will continue to ensure student safety is our No. 1 concern.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, the press tribune,local news, Roseville News, Granite Bay news, national news, state news, breaking news, crime log, sports, national sports, local sports, classifieds, Roseville photos, Roseville health, Roseville fitness, Roseville dinning guide,ski Roseville report, Roseville sports score, living, Roseville arts, Roseville entertainment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local Roseville news.
