He explained, \u201cDonald\u2019s record does not match what he says as a candidate.\u201d Cruz isn\u2019t the only one. Last month, Rush Limbaugh said that Trump\u2019s attacks on Cruz reflected the fact that he was not a \u201cgenuine conservative.\u201d Mark Levin said in 2011, \u201cTrump is NOT the real deal\u2026 He is not a conservative. He was happy to donate to Schumer, Weiner & Emanuel campaigns last year. He was pro-choice recently and now claims to be pro-life. He sounds more and more like Ross Perot.\u201d Andrew Breitbart said at the time, \u201cOf course he\u2019s not a conservative. He was for Nancy Pelosi before he was against Nancy Pelosi.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nI don\u2019t believe Trump is a conservative either; I\u2019ve said that repeatedly. Full disclosure: I\u2019ve also said that I would vote for Ted Cruz if the primaries took place today. I\u2019ve also said that Trump channels conservative anger against the establishment brilliantly, and that he has become a vessel for much-needed conversations on immigration.\n\nWith all that said, it\u2019s worthwhile exploring Trump\u2019s worldview. To do that, we must separate two elements of that worldview: his current positions, and his historic positions. The first goes to supposed conservatism, and the second goes to credibility \u2013 even if he says he\u2019s conservative today, should you believe him?\n\nWe\u2019ll go through the issues here (thanks to Conservative Review for a handy guide to Trump\u2019s positions as well). We report, you decide:\n\nImmigration. After a career of flip-flopping on immigration (he ripped Mitt Romney in 2012 for being too harsh on illegal immigration and in 2013 said he hired illegals at his golf courses), Trump has famously taken the most right-wing position on illegal immigration in this race. I wrote about it when Trump released it on his website. Trump wants a wall, shutting down remittances garnered from illegal wages, and foreign aid cuts. He wants strong deportation policies and an end to birthright citizenship. Because many Republicans feel that the immigration issue is the prerequisite for any continuation of a small government republic, Trump has made hay on this issue.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump flipped on Muslim refugees. Originally he said the U.S. would have to take in Syrian refugees; then he said he would take in no Muslim immigrants at all. That position has proved surprisingly durable with the conservative electorate.\n\nForeign Policy. Trump\u2019s been all over the place here. He\u2019s said we should leave the Islamic State to Russia and expressed sympathy for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, but also said that we should \u201cbomb the s***\u201d out of ISIS. He has both said that he would topple Bashar Assad and that he would not arm the Syrian rebels. In the end, he said he had a great idea for defeating ISIS, but wouldn\u2019t tell anyone what it was. He\u2019s said that he wouldn\u2019t immediately get rid of the Iran deal, but he stumped against the deal. He\u2019s talked about how he admires China, but then explained he wants to put a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods. Trump wants to expand the military, but how he would use that expanded military is far from clear.\n\nAbortion. Trump says he\u2019s pro-life. Bethany Blankley of Live Action News gives a solid roundup of the timeline:\n\n1999: Trump says he is \u201cvery pro-choice\u201d and said he wouldn\u2019t ban partial birth abortion.\n\nJanuary 2015: Trump says he is \u201cpro-life, with the caveats. You have to have the caveats.\u201d What would those caveats be? He explains: \u201clife of the mother, incest, and rape.\u201d Asked repeatedly whether abortion outside of his \u201ccaveats\u201d would be murder, he says, \u201cit depends when.\u201d\n\nAugust 2015: Trump tells CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo, \u201cMaybe some of the things [Planned Parenthood does] are good and I know a lot of things are bad\u2026 I mean, it\u2019s like an abortion factory, frankly.\u201d He then says he is pro-life and reiterates his \u201cexceptions.\u201d He tells Sean Hannity:\n\nThere\u2019s two Planned Parenthoods, in a way. You have it as an abortion clinic. Now, that\u2019s actually a fairly small part of what they do, but it\u2019s a brutal part, and I\u2019m totally against it. They also, however, service women. Maybe unless they stop with the abortions, we don\u2019t do the funding for the stuff that we want. We have to help women. So we have to look at the positives, also, for Planned Parenthood.\n\nEventually he told Breitbart he\u2019d oppose any government funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nDuring the first Republican debate, Trump says that he became pro-life sometime over the last few years, stating:\n\nFriends of mine years ago were going to have a child, and it was going to be aborted. And it wasn\u2019t aborted. And that child today is a total superstar, a great, great child. And I saw that. And I saw other instances. I am very, very proud to say that I am pro-life.\n\nJamie Weinstein of The Daily Caller asked Trump if he\u2019d have become pro-life if the kid had been a \u201closer.\u201d Trump said no.\n\nOctober 2015: Trump says he would appoint his sister, Maryanne Trump Barry, to the Supreme Court \u2013 even though she has ruled in favor of partial birth abortion. As to overturning Roe v. Wade, Trump says, \u201cyou need a lot of Supreme Court justices, but we\u2019re gonna be looking at that also very, very carefully,\u201d\n\nThis week, Trump said that he would think about pick pro-choice former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown for his vice president. He has never said that he would ban all abortions except for his exceptions \u2013 he\u2019s left vague how early he\u2019d ban abortion.\n\nSame-Sex Marriage. Trump says he\u2019s anti-same sex marriage but that it\u2019s the \u201claw of the land.\u201d In August, he said, \u201cSome people have hopes of passing amendments, but it\u2019s not going to happen. Congress can\u2019t pass simple things, let alone that. So anybody that\u2019s making that an issue is doing it for political reasons. The Supreme Court ruled on it.\u201d In December 2014, he reportedly told gay activist George Takei that he\u2019d gone to a same-sex wedding and found it \u201cbeautiful.\u201d Trump did say that he didn\u2019t think Kentucky court clerk Kim Davis should have been jailed.\n\nReligious Freedom. Trump pledges to uphold religious freedom but has not commented on the Indiana Religious Freedom and Restoration Act or any other similar act protecting religious practice in the face of leftist non-discrimination laws designed to quash religious observance.\n\nEntitlements. Unlike virtually all the other Republican candidates, Trump has said he wouldn\u2019t touch entitlements. He says that any Republican attempts to touch these programs will end in electoral defeat. His website currently carries an article from The Daily Signal titled, \u201cWhy Trump Won\u2019t Touch Your Entitlements.\u201d He said then, \u201cI\u2019m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I\u2019m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid. Every other Republican is going to cut, and even if they wouldn\u2019t, they don\u2019t know what to do because they don\u2019t know where the money is. I do.\u201d He bashed Paul Ryan\u2019s plans for entitlements for being \u201ctoo far out front with the issue.\u201d Trump has, however, said that certain parts of Social Security could be moved to private accounts \u2013 although he then says that he will save Social Security without cuts by discovering magical barrels of money: \u201cI know where to get the money from. Nobody else does.\u201d\n\nCampaign Finance Reform. Trump is for it, and he routinely attacks super PACs. Just last week, he said, \u201cI think you need it.\u201d He added, \u201cSomebody gives them money, not anything wrong, just psychologically when they go to that person, they\u2019re going to do it. They owe them. And by the way, they may therefore vote negatively toward the country. That\u2019s not going to happen with me.\u201d Campaign finance reform places outsized influence in the hands of the government and unions and quashes free speech.\n\nGovernment Involvement In The Economy. Trump accuses Ted Cruz of being a Wall Street insider because his wife works for Goldman Sachs. Trump himself supported Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus, TARP, and the 2008 auto bailout. He said in 2009, \u201cI think [Obama\u2019s] doing very well. You do need stimulus and you do have to keep the banks alive.\u201d He\u2019s admitted over and over to paying elected officials to grease the skids on his deals \u2013 although, in fairness, he says that\u2019s just how you have to work to get business done. In 2009, he said that the government should cap executive pay. Trump supported the Supreme Court\u2019s egregious Kelo v. New London (2005) decision, in which the court absurdly declared that the government could seize private property and turn it over to another private party so long as the second party paid additional taxes on it. Trump explained, \u201cI happen to agree with [the decision] 100%.\u201d\n\nEducation. Trump opposes Common Core but has flip-flopped on whether he\u2019d do away with the Department of Education; he told the South Carolina Tea Party last year that he wouldn\u2019t dump them completely. \u201cCertainly you could cut [that] way down,\u201d Trump said, but added that he\u2019d keep it alive for \u201ccoordination,\u201d as Conservative Review points out.\n\nHealthcare. Trump says he\u2019d dump Obamacare but then praises the nationalized health care system of Canada and Great Britain. In 1999 and 2000 he endorsed nationalized health care openly; in 2015, he praised Scotland\u2019s plan while appearing with David Letterman. He has proposed dumping restrictions on health care portability but continues to pump up nationalized health care systems. In September he told Hannity:\n\nAs far as single-payer and all \u2014 there\u2019s so many different things you could have. Honestly, Sean, to do, to have great health insurance. The one thing I do tell people, we\u2019re going to have something great. We\u2019re going to repeal and replace Obamacare, which is a total disaster.\n\nTax Plan. Trump\u2019s tax plan is certainly conservative. He proposes lowering the top tax bracket to 25 percent, drops the capital gains tax to 20 percent, dumps the death tax, and drops the corporate rate to 15 percent. The Tax Foundation states:\n\nOur analysis finds that the plan would reduce federal revenues by $11.98 trillion over the next decade. However, it also would improve incentives to work and invest, which could increase gross domestic product (GDP) by 11 percent over the long term. This increase in GDP would translate into 6.5 percent higher wages and 5.3 million new full-time equivalent jobs. After accounting for increased incomes due to these factors, the plan would only reduce tax revenues by $10.14 trillion.\n\nThat\u2019s different from his past positions on taxes, which include fighting the flat tax and proposing a wealth tax that would force owners to liquidate their property to pay taxes every year.\n\nTrade. Trump is for international tariffs, including an extraordinarily heavy tariff on Chinese goods, in the mistaken belief that this somehow helps the American economy. Tariffs certainly benefit protected sectors, but they hurt American consumers and destroy American purchasing power. Trump also wants to leave mandatory union dues alone \u2013 or at least he hasn\u2019t commented differently on the issue for several years.\n\nGuns. Trump has become progressively more pro-Second Amendment over time. His website states: \u201cThe Second Amendment to our Constitution is clear. The right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed upon. Period.\u201d\n\nSo, there you have it: Trump\u2019s mixed record on conservatism, even at present, belies the notion that he sees eye-to-eye with the Tea Party. Actually, Trump is far more populist than conservative \u2014 which means he has appeal to blue-collar Democrats, but also that he may not reliably stand by conservative principles in office. In fact, given his repeated position switching, the safe bet is that anything he says today will changed based on convenience. That should not encourage any conservative thinking of Trump in the primaries.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News, Editor-in-Chief of DailyWire.com, and The New York Times bestselling author, most recently, of the book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
