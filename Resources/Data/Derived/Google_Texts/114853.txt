Kroger Southwest Division and UFCW Local 455 have come to an agreement on pay and health benefits, according to a release. Disputes on pay and health benefits sparked tensions between the two groups in February.

According to the release, the agreement provides pay increases, more money for a health and welfare fund and ongoing financial support for pensions.

Back in February, the union said that Kroger agreed to pay additional money into a health and welfare fund if needed after Obamacare was passed in 2010. The union said their fund consultants notified both parties last fall that costs have been even higher than expected, and that the fund would need more money to protect their insurance through the end of the contract.

The shortfall, according to the union, was around $13 million.

The release said, “The union fully recommends if for ratification. Voting meetings will be scheduled soon.”
