AFTER a two-year break the popular Poole land train is back on track, ferrying visitors between the park and the quay.

New owners Kris and Jess Hall are breathing new life into the Rockley Rocket, with the 45-minute tour of the town an opportunity for the new PA system to be used by the conductor pointing out the sites and the history.

The land train has been a common sight in the town for the last 12 years and provides a hop-on, hop-off service as well as a town tour.

“We thought it was a terrible shame it wasn’t happening anymore,” said Kris, who with wife Jess runs the Peppermint Café in Parkstone Road and re-launched the Rocket on Saturday.

They bought the train with its three carriages around six months ago and will be running it daily until at least the end of September this year, starting again at Easter next year.

“Being new to Poole ourselves, we realised that everyone knew the quay but not everyone knows the park, and it’s beautiful. We are hoping the train will act as a conduit between the quay and Poole Park,” he said.

Part of the ticket price will go towards off-setting the carbon footprint and they aim for a carbon neutral certificate next year.

The couple came to the town from Bromsgrove and Kris was a police officer for 14 years before a career change to catering and tourism.

The Rocket can carry around 60 passengers, is accessible to disabled people and will be supporting events in the town.

The return of the land train was welcomed by Graham Richardson, Poole’s tourism manager. “It is really good to see it back again. It has been a big attraction for Poole and it’s great to see it return,” he said.
