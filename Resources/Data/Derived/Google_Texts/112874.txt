Sioux Falls, SD

Cold winter has set back construction of the highly anticipated renovations of the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society.

And while organizers are still anticipating a mid-summer ribbon cutting, fundraising remains at the half-way point.

The overnight drop-off site is the most anticipated facet of the $1.8 million expansion of the Sioux Falls Area Humane Society.

With 12 deep kennels ready for animals to be surrendered, it will supplement a need in the growing community, according to Executive Director Kori Baade.

"It's kind of a figure we say we hope we don't have again but we will probably end up with about 10,000 animals we've taken in this year. That's just this last year, the end of 2013. All of those figures aren't in yet but that is a lot. It's about 2,000 more than the year before and it just keeps growing," Baade said.

Baade says the expansion is necessary but it isn't coming easily. The extremely cold winter has set back construction a couple of weeks, as workers are forced inside.

Not only is it dangerous to be outside for extended periods, but the machines won't work in sub-zero temperatures.

"The weather is keeping us a little bit behind but we are moving forward as we want to," Baade said.

But fundraising is also slowing down, as donations are getting tied up in bigger projects like the Denny Sanford PREMIER Center and the SHEELS Iceplex.

Baade says they have only reached half of their fundraising goal for the expansion that will double the shelter's size.

"The more people that come, the more animals that come. And we really just had to get started and start looking forward because we were so full that we had animals in offices and foster homes, and we still do," Baade said.

The expansion would make room for an additional 200 animals.
