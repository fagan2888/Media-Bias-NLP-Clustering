The House on Tuesday passed legislation by voice vote to reauthorize National Aeronautics and Space Administration programs for 2015.

The measure would authorize $18 billion in funding for NASA programs, including $4.4 billion for space exploration and $3.8 billion for space operations.

It also includes language to state that the long-term goal of the NASA human spaceflight program is a successful human mission to Mars.

Lawmakers said the bill would provide consistent guidance for NASA's space mission for fiscal 2015, which ends Sept. 30.

"We are committed to once more launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil," said Rep. Steven Palazzo (R-Miss.), the chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology subcommittee that oversees NASA.

Rep. Donna Edwards (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the panel with jurisdiction over NASA, said NASA's research programs would be beneficial beyond space exploration, such as climate science.

"These programs will lead to new discoveries and deepen our scientific knowledge and in fact, much of NASA's work also benefits our society in terms of new technologies and applied research that can improve the quality of life of all our citizens," Edwards said.

The House passed identical legislation in June 2014 by a vote of 401-2, but the Senate did not consider it before the end of the last Congress.
