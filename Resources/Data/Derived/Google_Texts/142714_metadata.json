ObamaCare: many predicted the federal website would never be up and running by the looming deadline, the cost kept escalating, private contractors publically blamed bumbling bureaucrats and vice versa. Meanwhile, individuals who attempted to sign up ran into technical problems, and there were horror stories about people being told they would be dropped by their current insurance provider despite the fact the president had assured them this would not happen. Confusion was everywhere. Ultimately, key players got fired or resigned in disgrace.\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nSo, where do we stand today, one year later?\n\nThat\u2019s what the non-profit Transamerica Center for Health Studies (TCHS) wanted to know.\n\nThe Young and Resistant\n\nThe \u201cAffordable\u201d in the name of this massive federal insurance program refers to two things: holding down the cost of medical care at the consumer level and at the same time making sure that the premiums collected offset the benefits private insurance providers have to pay so that they can remain in business.\n\nTo this end, a key component of the math that went into designing the ACA was that in order to offset higher heath care spending by the elderly, there had to be a critical mass of younger, heathier participants, individuals who would pay more in premiums than they would actually use in benefits.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nAccording to TCHS Executive Director Hector De La Torre, the government \u201cdid not hit its target of 35% of Americans under age 35.\u201d Instead, only 28% of those who signed up for insurance fall into this category.\n\nInsurers Step Up to the Plate\n\nThe good news is that the free market bailed out the government. More private insurance companies than expected have signed up to offer policies through the so-called \u201chealthcare exchanges\u201d- state marketplaces where individuals can compare coverage and prices. This additional competition in some states \u201ckept premiums down,\u201d according to De La Torre, who adds that consumers report they are \u201cmostly satisfied\u201d with the options and quality of healthcare they have access to. Still a lot of people are not buying into this program.\n\nWhen asked why they have not signed up for health insurance, insufficient income is cited by just three percent of those surveyed- even though they could probably get coverage for free due to the government subsidy that\u2019s available. One-in-five said they oppose government-mandated insurance on principle. However, nearly 60% did the math and decided that the insurance is not worth it. For them, paying their health costs out-of-pocket as well as the penalty for not signing up is less expensive than paying monthly premiums. Presumably, a significant number of these individuals could afford to pay for health insurance and have simply made a rational decision not to sign up. Unfortunately, these are precisely the consumers the ACA needs in order to hold down costs.\n\nThe graphic below illustrates that there are those who remain uninsured tend to fall into distinct categories centered on income, education level, age and ethnic background.\n\nA looming problem is that those who received a government subsidy to help cover the cost of their monthly premiums could be in for a rude awakening. Literally hundreds of thousands of people have failed to provide the income documentation needed to justify the subsidy they received.\n\nThere\u2019s No Doctor for this Pain\n\nAccording to De La Torre, the government provides either an upfront offset to your monthly premium or a reduction in your federal tax bill. He warns that \u201cthere could be a clawback\u201d if you received the monthly subsidy. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on the individual [who received a request for additional information] to submit the paperwork.\u201d If, instead, your subsidy is coming in the form of a lower federal tax bill, you\u2019re going to be out of luck. (1)\n\nThere\u2019s another way you could take a financial hit. Under the ACA, you must be \u201ccontinuously insured\u201d for at least 9 months of the year. Otherwise, you will be charged a tax penalty when you file your 2014 income tax return. The penalty is $95/person or 1% of your income, whichever is higher. Thus, if your income is $50,000/year, your penalty would amount to $500.\n\nThe two requirements are independent of each other. \u201cIf you make premium payments all year but don\u2019t submit documentation, you\u2019ll be fine in terms of the tax penalty, but not the subsidy clawback,\u201d explains De La Torre.\n\nBusinesses are Adapting\n\nThe TCHS survey also looked at how the ACA is impacting employers. One third of businesses cited the additional cost of mandatory health insurance is their main concern. This is especially true among those who operate small firms.\n\nMany are still adapting and deciding how they will respond to new mandates that roll out. The most significant one is that starting in 2015 employers with more than 100 employees will have to provide health insurance to their workers or face a federal penalty. According to De La Torre, while \u201cmost\u201d firms of this size say they already provide health insurance to their employees, many still have to decide whether they will cover part-time workers, defined as those who work less than 30 hours/week, and dependents such as spouses and children.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS/Your Money Matters,/FOX BUSINESS/HEALTH CARE", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-08 12:23:58 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "This time last year there seemed to be a new catastrophe or scandal every day related to the roll-out of the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a.
