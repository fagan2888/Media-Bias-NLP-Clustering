â€” The Cumberland County Sheriff's Office is seeking the public's help to find a registered sex offender who allegedly beat his girlfriend and bit off her ear in Fayetteville.

Luther Paul Whittington Jr., 31, of 2615 Dinsmore Drive, is wanted on charged of maiming, first-degree burglary, assault on a female, assault on a child and assault inflicting serious injury in the presence of a minor.

The victim told deputies that Whittington broke into her home through a living room window on Friday evening. After she and her two young daughters hid in the bathroom, Whittington found them and began punching and kicking the woman while her children tried to help her, investigators said.

Whittington is black, wears his hair in long dreadlocks and has a tattoo on his right arm of the name "TIKA." He is about 5 feet 10 inches tall and 145 pounds.

He is believed to be driving a blue 1991 four-door Honda Accord.

Anyone with information on Whittington's whereabouts is asked to call the sheriff's office at 910-323-1500. Investigators asked the public not to approach him; he should be considered dangerous.
