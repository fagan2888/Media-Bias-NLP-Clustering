He asked, \u201cHow is she a fraud?\u201d Paglia opened the dam gates and everything pent up inside her was suddenly released.\n\n\u201cHillary is a mess,\u201d she said and then turned to Clinton\u2019s role as first lady.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to reward the presidency to a woman who\u2019s enabled the depredations and exploitation of women by that cornpone husband of hers?\u201d\n\nAlthough she acknowledged that Clinton appears to be the Democratic Party\u2019s favorite \u2014 especially among women \u2014 she said Clinton\u2019s past conduct should place her in the least favored category among women.\n\n\u201cThe way feminists have spoken makes us blind to Hillary\u2019s record of trashing [women].

He\u2019s a sex criminal! We\u2019re going to put that guy back in the White House? Hillary\u2019s ridden on his coattails. This is not a woman who has her own career, who\u2019s made her own career! The woman who failed the bar exam in Washington!
