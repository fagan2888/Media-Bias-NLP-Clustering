Representatives for Mrs. Sanders and her daughter, Leena Sanders beat the midnight deadline on Friday and filed a request to the Texas Supreme Court for more time to pursue an appeal in her battle against realty brokerage firm Henry S. Miller.\n\nYesterday we spotlighted the battle between Mrs. Sanders who does not dispute signing a contract in 2012. However, her daughter and medical professionals have countered that she was already exhibiting signs of Alzheimer\u2019s and therefore not qualified to enter into a legal agreement.\n\nThe sale fell through when the investor backed out, dropping plans to build a 7-11 where her home is located. However, Henry S. Miller says she owes their commission anyway. It has grown from $53,700 to $125,000 with legal fees and judgements added on.\n\nLeena Sanders feels encouraged by the response following the Dallas Morning News earlier story this week.
