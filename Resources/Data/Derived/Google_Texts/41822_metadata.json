According to the Washington Times, the site has received millions of dollars in funding from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in order to \u201ceducate healthcare professionals about parts of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThe funding, however, which totaled around $4.8 million, was actually directed to WebMD\u2019s Medscape platform, a site that is only accessible to doctors and provides them with continuing education on medical practices and other practical industry updates. Because the funds were not used to promote the Affordable Care Act through the company\u2019s public site WebMD, the company is refusing to release the contract that it made with the government.\n\nIowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, however, believes that the people deserve the right to see how much the government spent on articles that would explain how the new legislation worked.\n\n\u201cDisclosure and transparency would be a good practice for any recipient of federal funding to promote the administration\u2019s health care plan. Even if certain content is not produced with federal funding, but the same company takes federal government money to produce other materials, consumers would be better-informed by knowing the financial relationships,\u201d Grassley said.\n\nWhile that rhetoric sounds like an encouragement for companies to be more transparent with their funds, Grassley likely wants to deride the federal government for spending so much money on explaining its complicated health care law.\n\nAccording to Fox News, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius also recently expressed support for WebMD without mentioning the funds directed to the company.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0e0e0e", "p": {"domain_verify": "4e3a17d2b19ae614286124438d4e37ce"}, "description": "WebMD, the online publication responsible for delivering both helpful health news and terrifying descriptions ...", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "title": "Federal Government Gave WebMD $4.8 Million To Help Doctors Understand The Affordable Care Act", "modernizr-version": "2.8.3", "foundation-version": "5.4.7", "jquery-version": "2.1.1", "og": {"url": "http://www.opposingviews.com/i/technology/federal-government-gave-webmd-48-million-help-doctors-understand-affordable-care-act", "image": "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ov-file-archive/piece/34/4/704634.0.webmd.jpeg", "type": "article", "description": "WebMD, the online publication responsible for delivering both helpful health news and terrifying descriptions ...", "title": "Federal Government Gave WebMD $4.8 Million To Help Doctors Understand The Affordable Care Act"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-11-13T22:31:44+00:00", "theme-version": "1.2.4", "publish_date": "2013-11-13T22:31:44+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/ov_foundation/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#0e0e0e", "ov": {"id": 840854}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale = 1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2b53\"", "article_summary": "\u201cDisclosure and transparency would be a good practice for any recipient of federal funding to promote the administration\u2019s health care plan.\nBecause the funds were not used to promote the Affordable Care Act through the company\u2019s public site WebMD, the company is refusing to release the contract that it made with the government.\nEven if certain content is not produced with federal funding, but the same company takes federal government money to produce other materials, consumers would be better-informed by knowing the financial relationships,\u201d Grassley said.\nAccording to Fox News, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius also recently expressed support for WebMD without mentioning the funds directed to the company.\nWhile that rhetoric sounds like an encouragement for companies to be more transparent with their funds, Grassley likely wants to deride the federal government for spending so much money on explaining its complicated health care law."}
