Interestingly enough, research supports moderate drinking as part of a healthy lifestyle. One study, published in 2010, found that people who drank alcohol moderately had a lower risk of mortality than people who drank heavily \u2014 or didn\u2019t drink at all. There\u2019s also evidence that red wine, which is rich in antioxidants, can slow memory loss, protect against obesity, and even benefit cardiovascular health.\n\nPast centenarians have had their quirky \"health\" habits: some have eaten bacon and eggs every day, others have drunk one glass of wine with their dinners. But perhaps what keeps them young isn't a type of food or routine, but rather their mindset. Behrends, for example, worked as a custodian until he was 80, and he kept driving until 106. In a phone interview with Omaha.com, Behrends said he preserves his health by staying young at heart, and has to be reminded of his age (which is considered quite an accomplishment). \u201cI don\u2019t even notice\u201d growing old, he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "centenarian, beer, long life", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "After reaching his 110th birthday, Mark Behrends says it\u2019s all thanks to consuming one beer a day.", "title": "110-Year-Old Man Says A Beer A Day Is Secret To Long Life", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/beer-day-keeps-old-age-bay-110-year-old-man-says-alcohol-his-secret-long-life-334736", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/22/beer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After reaching his 110th birthday, Mark Behrends says it\u2019s all thanks to consuming one beer a day.", "title": "110-Year-Old Man Says A Beer A Day Is Secret To Long Life", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/beer-day-keeps-old-age-bay-110-year-old-man-says-alcohol-his-secret-long-life-334736", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/22/beer.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/05/22/beer.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-05-22T18:33:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-22T18:35:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "After reaching his 110th birthday, Mark Behrends says it\u2019s all thanks to consuming one beer a day."}, "article_summary": "One glass of beer a day has kept Mark Behrends young; at least that's what he claims is his youth elixir.\nIn a phone interview with Omaha.com, Behrends said he preserves his health by staying young at heart, and has to be reminded of his age (which is considered quite an accomplishment).\nPast centenarians have had their quirky \"health\" habits: some have eaten bacon and eggs every day, others have drunk one glass of wine with their dinners.\n\u201cHe always joked that that was his medicine since he takes very little medicine.\u201dBehrends mainly drank Miller brands, though he would turn to \u201cwhatever kind was around,\u201d he told Omaha.com in an interview.\nBut perhaps what keeps them young isn't a type of food or routine, but rather their mindset."}
