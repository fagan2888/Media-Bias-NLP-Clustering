Like his modern day counterpart, Donald Trump, Coughlin was a bona fide media star, with millions of listeners. \u201cWhen we get through with the Jews in America,\u201d Coughlin spewed, \u201cThey\u2019ll think the treatment they received in Germany was nothing.\u201d In December 1938, thousands of Coughlin\u2019s followers took to the streets of New York City, chanting, \u201cSend Jews back where they came from in leaky boats!\u201d\n\nI also remember the deep emotion my father expressed when we found out the method by which his grandparents, who\u2019d remained in Ukraine when my grandfather emigrated to the U.S., were murdered by the Nazis during WWII. Our family knows from personal experience the real consequences of hateful rhetoric.\n\nThat is why I am so deeply appalled that the party my father supported is aiding and abetting hate speech. That is why I was so disgusted with former Congressman Rob Simmons\u2019 answer to WPLR\u2019s Chaz and AJ when they posed the question: \u201cDonald Trump calls for a temporary ban on Muslims until our legislators can figure things out \u2014 is that nutty?\u201d\n\nSimmons said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s not nutty at all.\u201d Simmons claimed that Democrats from \u201cBarack Obama on down\u201d are scared of Trump. I\u2019m an unaffliated voter, and I\u2019m scared of him, but Simmons couldn\u2019t be more wrong (not to mention condescending: \u201cvoters have short attention spans\u201d) about the reason why.\n\nEither Chaz or AJ stated that \u201csomeone donated or deposited\u201d $28,500 in San Bernadino shooter Syed Farook\u2019s bank account before the attack, implying that it was a payment from a terrorist organization. Instead of correcting this with the known facts, namely that San Francisco-based online loan company Prosper already admitted that they were the originators of that loan, Simmons decided not to let mere \u201cfacts\u201d get in the way of some good, bigoted fear mongering.\n\n\u201cThey were probably getting ready to do some Christmas shopping, don\u2019t you think? To get some Christmas presents to put under the tree \u2014 maybe a blow-up Santa Claus to put on the lawn.\u201d He also incorrectly stated: \u201cOh and by the way it wasn\u2019t a holiday party, it was a Christmas party. These were Christians.\u201d Father Coughlin must be up in heaven, smiling down at his new Connecticut prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nNever mind that people of all religions were injured and killed in this attack, including a Muslim woman, Anies Kondoker, who worshiped at the same mosque as the attackers. Her husband, Saladin, appears to understand American values and the U.S. Constitution better than than Simmons or Trump ever will, observing: \u201cThe only way we can fight this crime is if we are united. If we are together I shall go to visit your church, temple, synagogues, and pray with you and mourn with you about our tragedy, and you should come to my mosque and pray with me.\u201d\n\nSimmons went on to quote the Breibart/Daily Caller line that the attack could have been prevented if not for political correctness, accusing Barack Obama of \u201cdemonizing\u201d anyone who is suspicious of Muslims. Never mind that a certain Republican president, George W. Bush, made a speech warning against the demonization of Muslims in the days following 9/11. How quickly Mr. Simmons forgets his history. \u201cWe\u2019re afraid to do anything for fear that we might be called be called \u2018prejudiced\u2019,\u201d Simmons complained.\n\nI call rubbish. I grew up in London during the IRA terrorist bombings and the PLO hijackings of the 1970s, Mr. Simmons. Even as an 8-year-old taking the Tube to school by myself I knew enough to report suspicious activity or an unattended package \u2014 no matter who left it. It\u2019s called situational awareness. The reason Americans are so clueless about it is because of this country\u2019s extreme ethnocentricity. Too many Americans appeared not to recognize that terrorism existed in the world until 9/11 because it didn\u2019t happen here. Simmons\u2019 comments are pure political posturing \u2014 the definition of \u201cUgly American.\u201d What\u2019s more, the kind of hate being spread by Trump and Simmons damages national security efforts at home, and puts Americans abroad at risk.\n\nI was so disgusted by Mr. Simmons\u2019 remarks that I called CT GOP Chairman J.R. Romano and asked him if he would repudiate them, and speak out against the dangerous rhetoric that seems to be pervading the party. Although we had a lengthy off-the-record conversation, the only on-the-record comment he would give me was the same canned response he\u2019s given every other reporter: \u201cThe presidential is months away, I am more concerned about what Dan Malloy and the democrats are doing to hard-working families in this state. The democrats are trying to avoid talking about their culture of tax increases and budget gimmicks.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been disappointed by lack of moral fortitude in lieu of political expedience in what used to be Grand Old Party. When Tea Party activists held an anti-Affordable Care Act rally on the steps of the Capitol in 2009, protesters held pictures of the Nazi concentration camp victims with the words \u201cNational Socialist Healthcare, Dachau, Germany, 1945.\u201d I was appalled, as was the Anti-Defamation League, which urged Republican congressional leaders to \u201ccondemn forcefully the invocation of Holocaust imagery.\u201d When this incident happened in 2009, I called a contact on the state GOP committee and asked him to publicly condemn this. He wouldn\u2019t do it, claiming that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see the actual banners.\u201d\n\nOf the Holocaust, we always say \u201cnever again.\u201d When I spent time in Germany in 2007, I saw a country with an incredible history of literature, art and philosophy, yet so much of it overshadowed by one decade. How could such a refined, cultured country have descended into such depravity?\n\nTwelve years ago, I was a docent when the \u201cAnne Frank \u2014 A History For Our Time\u201d exhibit came to Greenwich High School. I wrote in the Greenwich Time: \u201cI hoped kids would take away that we need to fight racism, prejudice and persecution wherever and whenever we encounter it . . . Hitler didn\u2019t come into power and create the death camps straight away. The road to Auschwitz was gradual and insidious. He started off targeting the weakest in society . . . when this met with no protest, it became easier to move on to the next step. The rest is history \u2014 unfortunately a history that goes on repeating itself. That leads to the next lesson: None of us can afford to be bystanders.\u201d\n\nMy grandparents Dorothy and Murray Silverstone weren\u2019t bystanders when Charles Lindbergh was perpetrating hate speech in the 1940s. I won\u2019t be now. Any politician who remains a bystander for political expediency or plays tit-for-tat politics at this critical junction in our nation\u2019s history loses my respect. It\u2019s such a continued policy of \u201cSee No Evil, Hear No Evil\u201d that lead our country to the disgraceful and dangerous point where we stand today.\n\nSarah Darer Littman is an award-winning columnist and novelist of books for teens.
