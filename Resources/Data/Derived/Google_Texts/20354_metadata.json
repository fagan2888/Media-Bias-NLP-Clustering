But the danger of such spills does not stop with the smoke. Oil from such accidents can cause major destruction to land and water, leaching into ground waters, as well as rivers, streams, lakes and marine waters wreaking havoc on fish and wildlife habitat.\u201d\n\nThe federal government seemed to concur on the danger aspect, directing transporters to take extra care.\n\nRELATED: Bakken Shale Oil + DOT 111: It's da Bomb\n\n\u201c[R]ecent derailments and resulting fires indicate that the type of crude oil being transported from the Bakken region may be more flammable than traditional heavy crude oil,\u201d the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration cautioned on January 2.\n\nThe train was carrying 3.5 million gallons of Bakken crude. Though no one was killed or injured in the North Dakota explosion, 1,000 residents of 2,500-population Casselton had to be evacuated. Previous such accidents have resulted in tragedy.
