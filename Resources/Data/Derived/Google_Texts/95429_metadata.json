Sometimes, these rules may make sense. We entrust doctors to advise us on the correct procedures and medicine, expertise that takes years of training and costs a lot of money. We can argue whether medical school should cost as much as it does\u2014one reason health care is so expensive is that we pay doctors a lot, enough to cover their initial investment\u2014but the purpose of the licensing doctors is clear.\n\nBut why does a manicurist need thousands of hours of training? All 50 states require manicurists to licensed. Same goes for barbers, cosmetologists, and skin care specialists. Thirty-six states require a license to be a make-up artist, thirty-three to be an auctioneer, and five to be a \"shampooer.\" Louisiana even requires florists to be licensed.\n\nOn Monday, I argued that the Republicans' deregulatory agenda should focus on occupational licensing, as well as housing policies and copyright law, rather than on Obamacare and the EPA. Sure enough, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced on Thursday that he\u2019s going to ask governors around the country about their licensing practices. (Thanks for reading, Eric!)\n\n\u201cI think on average across the country it's 372 days to become a licensed cosmetologist. But if you look at a position like an emergency medical technician, it's only 33 days required,\u201d Cantor said at the American Enterprise Institute, where reform conservatives unveiled their new agenda. \u201cMost people who don't have the higher education degree, they really deserve us to exert extra effort to tear down these barriers.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Eric Cantor wants to reform occupational licensing regulations.
