It includes the delightful tidbit that at the nation\u2019s first stool bank, begun in an MIT lab and now located in Medford, donors are given nicknames like \u201cWinnie the Poo\u201d and \u201cVladimir Pootin.\u201d\n\nWe posted the back-story of the stool bank, by Gabrielle Emanuel, here in April: \u201cMIT Lab Hosts Nation\u2019s First Stool Bank, But Will It Survive?\u201d\n\nThe existential threat to the stool bank loomed from the FDA, which said it considered stool to be a drug, and thus potentially subject to regulations rigorous enough to send the costs of fecal transplants soaring and probably kill the bank. More recently, the agency has seemed to signal that it will allow some fecal transplants \u2014 at least for now.\n\nThe New Yorker story reports that orders for OpenBiome\u2019s stool supplies have been growing at 18 percent a month for the last year, spurring complaints from companies that are working on competing products \u2014 pills and enemas.\n\nThe prospects for poop pill prospects are looking promising, The New Yorker reports, and the stool bank is involved in those efforts as well:\n\nEven if OpenBiome were to stop shipping stool to hospitals, it could presumably continue to operate as a resource for researchers. When I visited in October, there was a tray of shiny white capsules on [co-founder Mark] Smith\u2019s desk\u2014\u201cpoop pills that we\u2019ve been working on,\u201d he explained. Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital had just announced the results of a study showing that capsules were as effective as colonoscopes for treating C. difficile, and the field was abuzz with the news, since, as Smith pointed out, \u201ceveryone would rather swallow a pill.\u201d He had hit on a way to improve on the doctors\u2019 methods: lining capsules with cocoa butter, which is solid at room temperature, thus insuring that they won\u2019t disintegrate prematurely\u2014on the shelf or in someone\u2019s mouth.\n\nMeanwhile, for Boston-area residents interested in becoming the next Vladimir Pootin, boston.com reported last month that the bank, which now ships to fecal samples to 122 hospitals, is paying $40 \u201cper dump:\u201d\n\nAre you under 50 years old, willing to make daily trips to Medford, and have regular bowel movements? You, my friend, could be earning $40 a day\u2014just for pooping.\n\nAnd for the more altruistically motivated:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The nation's first stool bank, begun at MIT, has moved to Medford, pays $40 per donation, and The New Yorker reports that it continues to operate despite uncertain prospects.", "og": {"site_name": "commonhealth", "description": "The nation's first stool bank, begun at MIT, has moved to Medford, pays $40 per donation, and The New Yorker reports that it continues to operate despite uncertain prospects.", "title": "\u2018Vladimir Pootin\u2019 To Poop Pills: Saga Of First Stool Bank Goes On", "url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/11/first-stool-bank-openbiome-continues", "image": "http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/03/stoolbottles-620x381.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://commonhealth.wbur.org/2014/11/first-stool-bank-openbiome-continues", "image": "//s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/15/files/2014/03/stoolbottles-620x381.jpg", "site": "@commonhealth", "card": "summary", "title": "'Vladimir Pootin' To Poop Pills: Saga Of First Stool Bank Goes On"}, "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-24", "msvalidate.01": "D02D46BAEDB3F81FC1B1DE2A8CB69551", "fb": {"admins": 1549080028, "app_id": 134067973330252}, "date": "Mon, 24 Nov 2014 10:25:56 -0500"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc17\"", "article_summary": "\u2018Vladimir Pootin\u2019 To Poop Pills: Saga Of First Stool Bank Goes OnComing up in the next issue of The New Yorker: \u201cThe Excrement Experiment,\u201d a sweeping disquisition on the history of fecal transplants for treating intestinal ills.\nMore recently, the agency has seemed to signal that it will allow some fecal transplants \u2014 at least for now.\nThe prospects for poop pill prospects are looking promising, The New Yorker reports, and the stool bank is involved in those efforts as well:Even if OpenBiome were to stop shipping stool to hospitals, it could presumably continue to operate as a resource for researchers.\nWhen I visited in October, there was a tray of shiny white capsules on [co-founder Mark] Smith\u2019s desk\u2014\u201cpoop pills that we\u2019ve been working on,\u201d he explained.\nIt includes the delightful tidbit that at the nation\u2019s first stool bank, begun in an MIT lab and now located in Medford, donors are given nicknames like \u201cWinnie the Poo\u201d and \u201cVladimir Pootin.\u201dWe posted the back-story of the stool bank, by Gabrielle Emanuel, here in April: \u201cMIT Lab Hosts Nation\u2019s First Stool Bank, But Will It Survive?\u201dThe existential threat to the stool bank loomed from the FDA, which said it considered stool to be a drug, and thus potentially subject to regulations rigorous enough to send the costs of fecal transplants soaring and probably kill the bank."}
