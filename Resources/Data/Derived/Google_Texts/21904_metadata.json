Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) isn\u2019t exactly a credible voice. It was, after all, the failed far-right presidential candidate who recently equated Nelson Mandela\u2019s fight against apartheid to the Republican crusade against the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut on Friday, Santorum was in rare form \u2013 even by his standards \u2013 speaking at a Young Americans for Freedom event at the Reagan Ranch. Andrew Kaczynski captured this striking quote, which I\u2019ve read several times, and which I still find confusing.\n\n\u201cIf we have a system where the government is going to be the principal provider of health care for the country, we\u2019re done. Because then, you are dependent on the government for your life and your health. [\u2026] \u201cWhen Thatcher ran for prime minister she said \u2013 remember this, this is the Iron Lady \u2013 she said, \u2018The British national health care system is safe in my hands.\u2019 She wasn\u2019t going to take on health care, because she knew once you have people getting free health care from the government, you can\u2019t take it away from them. \u201cAnd the reason is because most people don\u2019t get sick, and so free health care is just that, free health care, until you get sick. Then, if you get sick and you don\u2019t get health care, you die and you don\u2019t vote. It\u2019s actually a pretty clever system. Take care of the people who can vote and people who can\u2019t vote, get rid of them as quickly as possible by not giving them care so they can\u2019t vote against you. That\u2019s how it works.\u201d\n\nHmm.\n\nIn that first paragraph, I\u2019m not sure Santorum has fully thought his argument through. For example, the vast majority of Americans do not rely on the government as the \u201cprovider\u201d of health care services \u2013 the exception is the U.S. military, which has government-run health care in which medical professionals are public employees \u2013 and this will not change once the Affordable Care Act is fully implemented. (Under Santorum\u2019s preferred vision, I assume the uninsured would go back to having no provider whatsoever for medical services?)\n\nAs for \u201cdependence,\u201d most of us rely on the public sector for police protection, fire emergencies, natural-disaster response, infrastructure, education, and national-security crises, but this doesn\u2019t mean \u201cwe\u2019re done\u201d as a country.\n\nIn the second paragraph, Santorum may not appreciate the profound differences between the American and British health care systems. Either way, I guess Santorum is disappointed that Thatcher wasn\u2019t right-wing enough?\n\nAnd then there\u2019s that third paragraph, which is something of a mystery. I think Santorum is trying to suggest President Obama was \u201cclever\u201d in creating a health care system that kills off Republican voters, but I haven\u2019t the foggiest idea why Santorum would believe this.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Rick Santorum isn't exactly a credible voice on health care policy, but his latest theory is a doozy, even by Santorum standards.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/santorum-uncovers-pretty-clever-system", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Rick Santorum isn't exactly a credible voice on health care policy, but his latest theory is a doozy, even by Santorum standards.", "title": "Santorum uncovers 'a pretty clever system'", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/santorum-uncovers-pretty-clever-system", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/articles/2012-03-21t021231z_01_jme418_rtridsp_3_usa-campaign-santorum.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/santorum-uncovers-pretty-clever-system", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/articles/2012-03-21t021231z_01_jme418_rtridsp_3_usa-campaign-santorum.jpg?itok=CWZKwPJ1", "height": 553}, "title": "Santorum uncovers 'a pretty clever system'", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Rick Santorum isn't exactly a credible voice on health care policy, but his latest theory is a doozy, even by Santorum standards."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2013-12-16T16:00:00-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "rick-santorum,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "Santorum uncovers 'a pretty clever system'", "published": 1, "date": "12/16/2013 16:00:00 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/santorum-uncovers-pretty-clever-system"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/msnbc", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Rick Santorum isn't exactly a credible voice on health care policy, but his latest theory is a doozy, even by Santorum standards.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Rick Santorum"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc962e\"", "article_summary": "I think Santorum is trying to suggest President Obama was \u201cclever\u201d in creating a health care system that kills off Republican voters, but I haven\u2019t the foggiest idea why Santorum would believe this.\n\u201cAnd the reason is because most people don\u2019t get sick, and so free health care is just that, free health care, until you get sick.\nIn the second paragraph, Santorum may not appreciate the profound differences between the American and British health care systems.\nWhen it comes to health care analysis, former Sen.
