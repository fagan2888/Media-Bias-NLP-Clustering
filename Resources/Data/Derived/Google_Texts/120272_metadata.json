I'm not a Rubio fan, but arguments like this are just silly.\n\nThe centerpiece of Rubio\u2019s proposal would \u201cprovid[e] every American with an advanceable, refundable tax credit that can be used to purchase insurance.\u201d What does that mean? If you purchase a government-approved health plan, you could save, for example, $2,000 on your taxes. If you don\u2019t, you pay that $2,000 to the government. That is exactly how Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate works.\n\nNo. That is not how Obamacare's individual mandate works.\n\nAnd if tax credits are now an individual mandate, then...\n\n1. The term has no meaning\n\n2. We all have a ton of individual mandates for everything that we could potentially get a tax credit for\n\nThere are no doubt people at Cato who would like to make that argument, but there's a big difference between money you could get and money you must pay. It actually tends to be the left that makes this type of argument. You could argue that the entire tax system is an individual mandate to be poor. It's a neat line and you could see Rubio or Cruz delivering it, but in this case it deliberately confuses the issue.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "title": "No, Rubio's Health Plan Does Not Have an \"Individual Mandate\"", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/261972/no-rubios-health-plan-does-not-have-individual-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/02/ac1.jpg?itok=OTCX7_Of", "updated_time": "2016-02-27T10:12:24-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/261972/no-rubios-health-plan-does-not-have-individual-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/02/ac1.jpg?itok=OTCX7_Of", "card": "summary", "title": "No, Rubio's Health Plan Does Not Have an \"Individual Mandate\""}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-27T10:12:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-27T10:12:24-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That is exactly how Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate works.\nThat is not how Obamacare's individual mandate works.\nYou could argue that the entire tax system is an individual mandate to be poor.\nThe centerpiece of Rubio\u2019s proposal would \u201cprovid[e] every American with an advanceable, refundable tax credit that can be used to purchase insurance.\u201d What does that mean?\nAnd if tax credits are now an individual mandate, then...1."}
