High St., Suite 200, in Lebanon. (Photo: Submitted)\n\nWilson County's first Neighborhood Health clinic has opened in Lebanon to target uninsured and underserved residents with preventative and primary care.\n\nNeighborhood Health, a private nonprofit network of neighborhood health centers, is on East High Street.\n\n\"A clinic serving those who are low income can have a significant impact on the health of the county,\" Neighborhood Health CEO Mary Bufwack said in a news release.\n\nLebanon was chosen because of its rate of low-income and uninsured residents, Bufwack said. More than 6,000 are uninsured in the city, according to Neighborhood Health research.\n\nThere are 12 clinics in the Neighborhood Health network, the others in Davidson and Trousdale counties.\n\nAbout 2,500 people are projected to be served annually at the Wilson County clinic.\n\nServices will be provided with payments discounted based on family size and income. TennCare and other insurance are accepted. Services will not be denied because of inability to pay. \u200bA licensed behavioral health provider to provide counseling also will be at the Lebanon clinic.\n\nThe clinic opened through a $495,000 Affordable Care Act grant. The grant is part of a national initiative funding 164 new community health centers totaling $101 million.\n\nNeighborhood Health at Lebanon\n\nLocation: 217 E.
