Nathan Deal recently proposed the state\u2019s fiscal year 2016 budget. In it, he recommended eliminating State Health Benefit Plan coverage for non-certified staff \u2014 bus drivers, food service workers, custodians and secretarial employees \u2014 who work, on average, less than 30 hours per week.\n\nDeal\u2019s proposal to cut coverage to about 11,500 part-time employees was an effort to save the state $103 million next year.\n\nSteve Weed drives a bus for Kelly Mill Elementary, Liberty Middle and West Forsyth High schools. The cut would not affect him because he works 32.5 hours a week.\n\nHad it occurred during his first or second year in the district, however, Weed would have found himself in the same situation facing many of his co-workers. At age 61, he said, many employers \u201cdid not want me, so the insurance drew me to it.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s not alone.\n\nThe average salary for a bus driver in Forsyth \u2014 one of the most affluent counties in Georgia \u2014 is $19,000, said Dan Jones, chief financial officer for Forsyth County Schools. Of the district\u2019s 314 drivers, 58 would no longer be subsidized for health insurance costs under the governor\u2019s proposal.\n\nThere are 282 food service workers, Jones said, excluding managers. A loss in benefits would affect 124 employees. Their average salary is $12,000.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the 2015 poverty level for an individual is $11,770.\n\nConcerned for the consequences\n\nSome employees have been with the district for 25 to 30 years, Jones said.\n\n\u201cThese jobs are essential to keeping the school system going,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as just increasing their hours, because you have to have a certain number of people in the cafeteria at a time.\u201d\n\nGarry Puetz, the district\u2019s director of transportation, said he met with drivers who may be affected by the decision.\n\n\u201cAlmost to a person, a main reason they came to be a bus driver was for the insurance benefits,\u201d Puetz said. \u201cMost everyone will have to consider at the very least leaving school bus driving if they\u2019re not getting benefits.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very important piece of their compensation. School bus driving in Georgia has been that way for three decades now.\u201d\n\nPuetz said a main concern to school administrations is an exodus of skilled drivers leaving the work force.\n\n\u201cStudents will be at greater risk as they wait longer at bus stops, squeeze onto overcrowded buses and ride with less-qualified drivers,\u201d according to a position paper on the governor\u2019s recommendation, written by the Georgia Association for Pupil Transportation, an organization aimed to protect students who ride buses. Puetz is the group\u2019s president.\n\nAbout 24,000 students ride a bus every day in Forsyth County, Puetz said. That\u2019s more than half of the student population.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the big piece. There\u2019s another 11,000 trips on field trips and athletic trips that we [would] struggle to be able to deliver,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cA legitimate fear\u201d\n\nWhile about 20 percent of Forsyth drivers would lose benefits, he said, more rural and southern areas of the state may see 80 to 100 percent of bus drivers affected.\n\nState lawmakers have already started developing a solution.\n\nMike Dudgeon, state house representative for District 25 in south Forsyth, said an amendment was passed for the mid-year 2015 budget ordering the State Health Benefit Plan to do an audit and find out why it costs more than other neighboring states.\n\nWhile Dudgeon sits on various educational reform committees, he is not working directly on this part of the budget. However, he said, \u201call of the [state] House and Senate members are involved to some extent because we\u2019ve all heard a tremendous amount of pushback on this.\u201d\n\nDudgeon, who previously served on Forsyth County\u2019s school board, said he is in favor of a compromise that lets non-certified staff retain health care coverage but potentially asks school systems to pay the subsidies or charge higher premiums.\n\n\u201cI do understand why the governor [made the proposal] because no other part-time employee in the state gets insurance,\u201d Dudgeon said. \u201cBut it\u2019s different because so many times they do the job for the insurance benefits because their pay is very low.\n\n\u201cIf you get rid of [benefits], there\u2019s a legitimate fear [districts] can\u2019t fill those jobs, or the people they may get may not be the people they want.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.forsythnews.com/archives/26683/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/forsythnews/article/2015/01/31/bus.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "FORSYTH COUNTY \u2014 They\u2019re chauffeurs and caretakers, chefs and custodians.", "title": "Officials fear insurance cuts may prompt exodus of Forsyth school bus drivers"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Officials fear insurance cuts may prompt exodus of Forsyth school bus drivers"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeda1\"", "article_summary": "They also may soon see their state health insurance benefits taken away.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s different because so many times they do the job for the insurance benefits because their pay is very low.\n\u201cAlmost to a person, a main reason they came to be a bus driver was for the insurance benefits,\u201d Puetz said.\nOf the district\u2019s 314 drivers, 58 would no longer be subsidized for health insurance costs under the governor\u2019s proposal.\n\u201cMost everyone will have to consider at the very least leaving school bus driving if they\u2019re not getting benefits."}
