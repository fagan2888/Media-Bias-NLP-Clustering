He says he is prepared to fight what he predicts will be a campaign as personal as the last one.\n\n\u201cThey just tried to hammer me down as much as they could, personally,\u201d Mills said, \u201cdropping anvil after anvil on my head. It was nothing on the issues.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s different this year, says Mills, is no Democratic Senator Al Franken at the top of the ticket, which he believes helped Nolan eke out a 1 1/2 point victory.\n\n\u201cThe pendulum in the 8th district does not swing that much,\u201d he said, promising a much more aggressive get-out-the-vote effort than in 2014. \u201cWhat we are looking at here is kind of the perfect combination where it is Rick Nolan head to head. And the the conservative voters are going to turn out with the similar intensity as the liberal voters and what happens at the top of the ticket will not matter as much.\u201d\n\nMills says many of the campaign issues will be the same: Replacing the Affordable Care Act with a private-focused alternative, including Health Savings Accounts and the ability to buy catastrophic health coverage across state lines. He says he\u2019ll make \u201creplacing Obamacare\u201d a focus.\n\nHe\u2019ll also try to change the Iran Treaty, which Nolan supported and for which a conservative group launched a tough anti-Nolan ad.\n\nMills also says he will make the 2nd Amendment part of the 2016 race. He says he would not change any gun laws, despite pressure to do so after multiple mass shootings around the country.\n\n\u201cYou are never going to prevent evil, and people who are mentally ill are not by their nature, dangerous,\u201d he said.\n\nMills is part of the Mills Fleet Farm store family \u2014 which sells guns \u2014 and proudly owns many. This week, he posted a shirtless Twitter image of himself hunting, and he won\u2019t reveal how many weapons he owns.\n\n\u201cI own quite a few,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a collecter. I am a sportman and a hunter. And I shoot competitively. A lot. And let\u2019s just leave it there.\u201d\n\nMills is sporting a new look too, having cut his famously long hair after a summer grilling accident. His hair was once the target of millions of dollars in negative ads from outside groups.\n\n\u201cMy wife loves romance novels, and she loved the fact that I looked like Fabio,\u201d he said, \u201cAnd she was the last person in the world who wanted me to get my hair cut. But finally I had this Fourth of July grilling incident, where I got a hot flash from a gas grill, and it took that for me to convince my wife that it was time for me to get a haircut.\u201d\n\nExperts predict Minnesota\u2019s 8th District will be among the most competitive \u2014 and expensive \u2014 in the country.\n\n\u201cRick Nolan is a sitting duck,\u201d said Larry Jacobs of the Humphrey School of Public Affairs. \u201cHe\u2019s considered by Republicans and Democrats as one of the most vulnerable members of Congress up for election.\u201d\n\nCongressman Nolan \u201cwelcomed\u201d Mills to the race with a written statement:\n\n\u201cI welcome Mr. Mills III back into the race, and I\u2019m looking forward to a positive campaign based on facts and issues affecting the voters in the 8th Congressional District \u2014 a campaign very much different from the negative and misleading campaign Mr. Mills III and his allies have already launched against me here in the 8th District.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Stewart Mills has officially announced he is in the race for Minnesota's 8th congressional district.
