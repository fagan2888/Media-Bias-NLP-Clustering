Included in the Little Sisters lawsuit are the Christian Brothers Services and Christian Brothers Employee Benefits representing hundreds of similar nonprofit Catholic ministries.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church has always condemned abortion as the taking of human life and also is opposed to the use of artificial contraception. Protestant Christians vary in their views, but conservatives and evangelicals also tend to hold strong anti-abortion stands that would include objections to the \u201cmorning-after\u201d pill and contraceptives such as the intrauterine device thought by some to cause early abortions.\n\nThe complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Denver on behalf of Little Sisters of Denver and Baltimore and Christian Brothers of New Mexico names Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services; Thomas E. Perez, secretary of the Department of Labor; Jacob J. Lew, secretary of the Department of the Treasury; and their respective departments as defendants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe employers, the complaint states, \u201care forbidden by their religion from participating in the federal government\u2019s regulatory scheme to promote, encourage, and subsidize the use of sterilization, contraceptives, and drugs that cause abortions. The government defendants, however, have imposed regulatory requirements that require the class plaintiffs to provide health benefits for their employees that include coverage for, or access to, contraception, sterilization, abortifacients and related education and counseling ...\n\n\u201cThe result is that the class members have been offered a stark choice: They must either abandon their Catholic beliefs and participate in the ... mandate or they will be punished by the government with an array of fines and penalties unless and until they comply.\u201d\n\nThe most prominent lawsuit filed against the HHS Mandate is the one brought by the craft store chain Hobby Lobby Inc. that recently won a preliminary challenge in the U.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver.\n\nThe chain is owned by a Christian family that argued its religious liberty was violated in requiring it to provide full health care, including free contraception, to employees.\n\nThe Little Sisters case involves a nonprofit religious organization, but the organization \u2014 which employs non-Catholics \u2014 also was considered not to be exempt even under accommodations made in the provision as it was finalized last summer, Rienzi said.\n\nThe Becket Fund for Religious Liberty in Washington, D.C., is handling about 10 of the 72 pending lawsuits challenging the mandate in its final form, including the Hobby Lobby and Little Sisters cases.\n\nCardinal Timothy Dolan, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, criticized the final mandate rule for including a definition of exempt religious employers that was too narrow and excluding religious ministries from the government\u2019s \u201caccommodation\u201d definition.\n\nThe San Pedro home provides three levels of care for about 90 residents at 2100 S. Western Ave. Housed since 1979 where the former Fermin Lasuen Catholic High School once stood, the facility was founded in 1901 and operated in its first decades in the Boyle Heights area of Los Angeles.\n\nSister Loraine Marie, superior for one of the three U.S. provinces where Little Sisters homes operate, said in a news release that the requirement to provide drugs that could cause early abortions violated the ministry\u2019s religious freedom.\n\n\u201cLike all of the Little Sisters, I have vowed to God and the Roman Catholic Church that I will treat all life as valuable, and I have dedicated my life to that work,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot violate our vows by participating in the government\u2019s program to provide access to abortion-inducing drugs.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Little Sisters of the Poor, the order of Roman Catholic nuns that provides homes for the elderly, including one in San Pedro, is at the center of a lawsuit filed Tuesday challenging the Obamacare requirement that they provide cost-free contraceptives", "title": "Catholic nuns at Little Sisters of the Poor sue over Obamacare contraception mandate", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/social-affairs/20130924/catholic-nuns-at-little-sisters-of-the-poor-sue-over-obamacare-contraception-mandate", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LI/20130924/NEWS/130929741/AR/0/AR-130929741.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1125px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Catholic nuns at Little Sisters of the Poor sue over Obamacare contraception mandate"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailybreeze.com", "description": "Little Sisters of the Poor, the order of Roman Catholic nuns that provides homes for the elderly, including one in San Pedro, is at the center of a lawsuit filed Tuesday challenging the Obamacare requirement that they provide cost-free contraceptives", "title": "Catholic nuns at Little Sisters of the Poor sue over Obamacare contraception mandate", "url": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/social-affairs/20130924/catholic-nuns-at-little-sisters-of-the-poor-sue-over-obamacare-contraception-mandate", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailybreeze.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LI/20130924/NEWS/130929741/AR/0/AR-130929741.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@DailyBreezeNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551753330", "iphone": "id503015160", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.torrancedailybreeze"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Contraception controversy, Contraception controversy news, Torrance Contraception controversy news, CA Contraception controversy news, US Contraception controversy news, world Contraception controversy news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Contraception controversy, Contraception controversy news, Torrance Contraception controversy news, CA Contraception controversy news, US Contraception controversy news, world Contraception controversy news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7e01\"", "article_summary": "The Little Sisters could face steep fines if they are not in compliance with the law by January 2014, Rienzi said.\nIncluded in the Little Sisters lawsuit are the Christian Brothers Services and Christian Brothers Employee Benefits representing hundreds of similar nonprofit Catholic ministries.\n\u201cBy God\u2019s grace, we\u2019re hoping for a successful conclusion,\u201d said Victor Salsido, director of human resources at the Little Sisters of the Poor home in San Pedro.\n\u201cThe Little Sisters are driven by their religious faith to do what they do in terms of taking care of the elderly poor,\u201d said Mark Rienzi, senior counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.\n\u201cLike all of the Little Sisters, I have vowed to God and the Roman Catholic Church that I will treat all life as valuable, and I have dedicated my life to that work,\u201d she said."}
