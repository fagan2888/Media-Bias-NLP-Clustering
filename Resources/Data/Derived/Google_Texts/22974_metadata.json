They\u2019re meant for our patients and the whole gamut of our physicians, whether you\u2019re in a small practice\u2026or in a large academic setting,\u201d Theodore M. Freeman, MD, FAAAAI, of the San Antonio Asthma and Allergy Clinic in San Antonio, Texas, said during the press conference.\n\nThe evidence-based recommendations are designed to trigger conversations between patients and health care providers to develop intelligent decision-making regarding the diagnosis and treatment of patients with allergies, asthma and immunologic diseases.\n\nLinda Cox\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a practicing clinician; I have to say that I\u2019ve found several of these, if not all of these useful in my practice, especially the one about routine allergy testing,\u201d Linda Cox, MD, FAAAAI, AAAAI President and private practitioner at the Allergy & Asthma Center in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, said during the press conference.\n\nSpecifically, they have added five points of interest to the existing Choosing Wisely campaign, including:\n\nDon\u2019t rely on antihistamines as first-line treatment in severe allergic reactions\n\nDon\u2019t perform food IgE testing without a history consistent with potential IgE-mediated food allergy\n\nDon\u2019t routinely order low- or iso-osmolar radiocontrast media or pretreat with corticosteroids and antihistamines for patients with a history of seafood allergy, who require radiocontrast media\n\nDon\u2019t routinely avoid influenza vaccination in egg-allergic patients\n\nDon\u2019t overuse non-beta lactam antibiotics in patients with a history of penicillin allergy, without an appropriate evaluation\n\nFalse or clinically irrelevant positive allergy tests for foods are frequent, according to John Oppenheimer, MD, FAAAAI, of Pulmonary and Allergy Associates, in Denville, NJ.\n\n\u201cJust because a test exists doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a useful test,\u201d Oppenheimer said.\n\nAccording to David M. Lang, MD, FAAAAI, of the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, Ohio, the exact mechanism for contrast media reactions is unknown, but there is still no evidence regarding the cause and effect connection with seafood allergy.\n\n\u201cBecause somebody has a history of seafood allergy they should not routinely receive pretreatment,\u201d Lang said. \u2013 by Samantha Costa\n\nFor more information:\n\nChoosing Wisely Campaign for Allergy and Immunology.
