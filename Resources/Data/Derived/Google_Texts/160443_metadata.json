I did deviate from this text at some points \u2013 including a 10-second refutation of the idea that \u201cgay is the new black\u201d \u2013 but the video message follows this text for the most part, despite the rain completely obliterating my notes.\n\nWe are not here to bash or attack anyone. We are here to call for social sanity and public safety in the city of Charlotte and we appeal to Mayor Roberts and to all City Council members to do what is right and fair and just for the people who live, work, and regularly visit this great city.\n\nOver the last week, we have collected signatures of faith, community, and business leaders in Charlotte to sign a joint letter stating our serious concerns with the proposed ordinance. This letter was hand-delivered to each Council Member and to Mayor Roberts this morning with more than 200 signees, a significant number.\n\nMayor Roberts, Council Members . . . if you are listening . . . DONT DO IT CHARLOTTE.\n\nI stand here today not only as a Christian leader but as a husband, father, and grandfather.\n\nWill you inconvenience, embarrass, and potentially endanger 997 citizens for the sake of three out of a thousand who identify as transgender?\n\nTwo weeks ago, in Seattle, Washington, \u201cA man undressed in a women's locker room, citing a new state rule that allows people to choose a bathroom based on gender identity.\u201d\n\nA concerned mom from Washington shared this with me about her local YMCA: \u201cJust two weeks ago a boy around the age of 13 walked right into the girls\u2019 side of the women's locker room. All he did was sit down and scroll through his phone. Little girls where surprised when they came in from showering with their towels wrapped around them to see him sitting there. My daughter was one of those girls. This policy opens the door to those who have malicious intent.\u201d\n\nCity Council members, why on earth would you bring this to Charlotte? Is this what you want for your spouses and kids?\n\nIn 2012, also in Washington, female high-school students sharing a college campus swimming pool were shocked to see a 45-year-old male student who identifies as \u201cColleen\u201d sitting naked in their sauna. (The police report stated that \u201cshe\u201d was exposing \u201cher male genitalia.\u201d)\n\nThe girls were traumatized and the parents outraged, but college officials said they could not do a thing because of state policies against gender-identity discrimination.\n\nFathers and mothers of Charlotte, is this what you want in your city?\n\nTwice this past year a woman in Waltham, MA has encountered a man urinating in the ladies\u2019 restroom of her office building. He had long hair that was made up like a woman's and apparently was in women\u2019s clothes. At one point he exposed his male private parts to her. \u201cI was shaking by the time I got back to my office\u201d she told MassResistance. [The examples that follow have also been compiled by MassResistance.]\n\nIn California in 2013, \u201cA man dressed up like a woman was arrested after entering a Macy's women\u2019s restroom in order to videotape women. He spent two hours in the restroom before his camera was noticed by a customer.\u201d\n\nIn Oregon, in 2011, a man who had prior sex offenses against 5 to 9-year-old girls was arrested after he entered a women's locker room dressed in a bikini and started talking to girls in the hot tub.\n\nCity Council members, if this happens in our city, are you ready to look these families in the face and say, \u201cWe were the ones who voted this into law. We were the ones who opened the door to these abuses.\u201d And are you ready for the lawsuits that will follow?\n\nI know you\u2019re concerned about the needs of those who identify as transgender, and we\u2019re sensitive to those struggles too. We want to help them find wholeness as well. But, as one man recently commented after the pool incident in Seattle, these new ordinances cause a lot more \u201cpeople to feel exposed and vulnerable with the intention of reducing people feeling exposed and vulnerable.\u201d\n\nI ask again, will you hurt the 997 to help the three?\n\nWhen you have a blind student in a school, you don\u2019t impose that student\u2019s handicap on the entire school, forcing the other kids to read braille. But when it comes to those struggling with gender identity issues, the City Council wants to impose their struggles on the whole community \u2013 on impressionable little girls who will be traumatized by a man wearing a dress in the restaurant bathroom and on young ladies and women who will be forced to undress in the presence of a biological male in their gym locker room.\n\nAnd your policy opens up the door to heterosexual predators \u2013 or are you prepared to tell us how you can distinguish between a male who identifies as a woman and a heterosexual male voyeur who dresses as a woman?\n\nWhy are we even discussing this madness? And how can you vote for a bill that claims that if a man simply perceives himself to be a woman then he is a woman. Last year, one supporter of this bill told me that if I believe I\u2019m a horse, I can use the stable, since I\u2019m not hurting anyone, while another protestor told me if I believe I\u2019m black, then I\u2019m black. To repeat: This is social madness.\n\nI appeal to every man and woman of conscience to raise your voices tonight against this bill, to hold the City Council and Mayor responsible for promoting this bill, and to stand together until this bill is defeated in Charlotte.\n\nWe should treat with great compassion those who struggle with their gender identity, but we will not turn the world upside down on their behalf.\n\n[Please note that the AP report of the vote failed to mention the 250,000+ emails and the 20,000+ signatures. It also wrongly claimed that, \u201cOpponents of the measure - including some clergy and business owners - have sent the City Council a letter saying businesses should have the right to refuse service based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\u201d The 8-page letter, which I wrote, with the help of attorneys and pro-family leaders, and which was signed by more than 200 faith, community, and business leaders, said no such thing. It simply stated what the negative effects of the bill would be.
