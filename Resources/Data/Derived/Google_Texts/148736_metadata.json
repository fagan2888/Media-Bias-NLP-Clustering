Usually we\u2019ll start several IVs.\u201d\n\nCool temperatures always help reduce any heat or dehydration issues, and that proved to be the case Monday.\n\n\u201cLiterally, we gave a little bit of oral anti-nausea medication, a bunch of oral rehydration,\u201d he said. \u201cWe saw about 26, 28 people and nothing else.\u201d\n\nSeveral years ago, the team worked to get electricity in as many places on the course as possible. That has allowed them to strategically place 23 defibrillator units on the course \u2014 one about every half mile and 11 inside Folsom Field.\n\nThe Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 has also changed some procedures to where the medical team practices and prepares for a wide variety of potential situations.\n\nMonday proved to be very uneventful for Dorfman and his team, but it was a nice test run, he said.\n\n\u201cAlthough it was an easy day, it did give us an opportunity to check our systems,\u201d he said. \u201cThe communications systems worked really well.\u201d\n\nFootnotes. Mike MacIntyre completed the 10K course in 57 minutes, 6.95 seconds, with his wife, Trisha, crossing the finish line just 0.36 later. MacIntyre became the first Colorado head football coach to run the Bolder Boulder since Dan Hawkins in 2007. MacIntyre was one of several CU football staff members to run Monday. Offensive coordinator Brian Lindgren (50.54.58), director of quality control Joe Bleymaier (1:01.04.50) and operations and recruiting assistant Scott Unrein (50:40.47) also competed. \u2026 Race officials said there were 46,542 finishers and 52,500 people registered for this year\u2019s race. That was slightly below last year\u2019s total of 52,115, but ahead of 2012 and 2013. \u2026 Bosley said the total purse for the professional race was about $162,700. That\u2019s among the top three biggest purses in race history, he said.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "No major medical issues at Bolder Boulder 2015", "title": "No major medical issues at Bolder Boulder 2015", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/25/no-major-medical-issues-at-bolder-boulder-2015/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150525__bolder-boulder-2015-runnersp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150525__bolder-boulder-2015-runnersp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-25T19:10:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T00:17:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Running"}, "article_summary": "BOULDER \u2014 It\u2019s always a successful Bolder Boulder when Dr. Todd Dorfman doesn\u2019t have to do much.\nThe medical director for the race for the past 12 years, Dorfman delivered a positive report after Monday\u2019s 37th running of the Bolder Boulder.\nMacIntyre became the first Colorado head football coach to run the Bolder Boulder since Dan Hawkins in 2007.\nThe Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 has also changed some procedures to where the medical team practices and prepares for a wide variety of potential situations.\n\u201cFortunately, we didn\u2019t really have to do anything,\u201d said Dorfman, who works out of Boulder Community Hospital as an emergency physician and associate medical director of trauma services."}
