Before the big night, there are many preparations. People have to find the right dress, get the tux ordered and buy the tickets -- but before any of this, many people get asked to prom first.\n\nSince the beginning of time, boys and girls have been asking each other to prom. Back in the day, guys used to walk up to a girl and ask, \u2018Hey, would you like to go to prom with me?\u2019 and the girl would say yes. Now, guys are going to extra mile to make the moment special.\n\n\"Promposal\" is the new term for being asked to prom and one could say it is just as extravagant as asking someone to marry you. Some of the most popular ways that guys have asked are with sticky notes, some food or even huge signs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet the question is, why do people feel the need to ask others in a cute way? Is it due to competition or is it just a thoughtful reason?\n\n\u201cGuys feel the pressure to ask girls in a cute way because it is a competition. The competition is not between other guys though, it is the girls. The girls always try to say \u2018he asked me cuter\u2019 and \u2018Oh no, he asked me cuter\u2019 and it makes guys feel they need to make it the best it can be. Yet sometimes it\u2019s also the girls who demand that it better be cute or they won\u2019t go with you,\u201d said Sterling High School junior, Connor Sanger.\n\nYet other people sometimes have a different motive.\n\n\u201c(The reason I asked my date in a cute way was) because I told her that if she didn\u2019t ask me that I would embarrass her, so I did,\u201d said SHS junior, David Lock.\n\nLock had asked junior Shayla Klein at seven in the morning after one of her spring break practices with a huge sign with a multitude of balloons, a cupcake cone and had written a song called \u201cThe Shayla Klein Song\u201d with lyrics that read, \u201cOh Shayla Klein, you are so kind\u2026You are shinier than a dime.\u201d\n\nSome of the pressure also comes from the movies or TV shows. It seems that every person who asks someone to prom in a movie does it in some of the most obnoxious ways. For example, the popular '80s movie, \u2018Can\u2019t Buy Me Love\u2019 where Patrick Dempsy shows up on a lawn mower and sweeps her off her feet.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I feel that all guys should ask a girl to prom in a cute way. For them it may not be a special moment but for the girls at this age it means a lot. I really want it to be extravagant and fun because movies have set me to believe in love and romance,\u201d said SHS junior Anna Kenney. \u201cBut I\u2019m not afraid of not being asked in a cute way because all guys are doing it now. It is just kind of expected.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-lifestyles/ci_25500239/promposals-guys-getting-creative-getting-prom-date", "sailthru.author": "Erin Nielsen, Journal-Advocate intern", "ag": {"canon": "JournalAdvocate:article:25500239:view"}, "startDate": "2014-04-05T14:39:25-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "journal-advocate.com", "description": "Normal 0   false false false        MicrosoftInternetExplorer4  \nIt\u2019s the time of year where the flowers are in bloom and the high school students are going to prom.", "title": "\"Promposals:\" Guys getting creative in getting a prom date", "url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-lifestyles/ci_25500239/promposals-guys-getting-creative-getting-prom-date", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/0405/20140405_024039_promposal pic.jpg", "site": "@SterlingJA", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Lifestyles", "modificationDate": "2014-04-05T14:40:51-0600", "endDate": "2015-04-05T14:39:25-0600", "news_keywords": "Lifestyles, Lifestyles news, Sterling Colorado Lifestyles news, Sterling Colorado news, Lifestyles Sterling news, Lifestyles Colorado news, US Lifestyles news, world Lifestyles news.", "byline": "Erin Nielsen, Journal-Advocate", "pubDate": "2014-04-05T14:42:03-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-04-05T14:39:25-0600", "sailthru.title": "\"Promposals:\" Guys getting creative in getting a prom date", "verify-v1": "BXs3Tp/yfKM8u4D/sQH/llaXrumTjsEN3+pi+oLzohs=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/0405/20140405_024039_promposal pic_300.jpg", "description": "Normal 0   false false false        MicrosoftInternetExplorer4  \nIt\u2019s the time of year where the flowers are in bloom and the high school students are going to prom.", "sailthru.site": "journal-advocate.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sterling-lifestyles/ci_25500239/promposals-guys-getting-creative-getting-prom-date", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/0405/20140405_024039_promposal pic.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Normal 0   false false false        MicrosoftInternetExplorer4  \nIt\u2019s the time of year where the flowers are in bloom and the high school students are going to prom.", "title": "\"Promposals:\" Guys getting creative in getting a prom date"}, "google-site-verification": "2iNkVYi6fQKhylL0pQaJF4qvYsz3qMnvr9EdKrmIbvw", "y_key": "b781c784225bf6e2", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/0405/20140405_024039_promposal pic.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a82\"", "article_summary": "\u201cGuys feel the pressure to ask girls in a cute way because it is a competition.\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not afraid of not being asked in a cute way because all guys are doing it now.\n\u201cPersonally, I feel that all guys should ask a girl to prom in a cute way.\nSome of the most popular ways that guys have asked are with sticky notes, some food or even huge signs.\nAdvertisementYet the question is, why do people feel the need to ask others in a cute way?"}
