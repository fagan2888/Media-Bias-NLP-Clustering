The consolidation is a flat pattern built on top of a cup with handle. It offers a potential buy point at 48.30.\n\nThe stock broke past a 44.78 entry in the cup with handle in October, but volume was weak. Paychex rose about 7% and then began the next consolidation.\n\nIndividual investors should watch to see if the stock can break out in strong volume.
