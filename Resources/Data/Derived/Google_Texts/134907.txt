With many people enjoying their time at home during Christmas one local church took the time out of their morning to visit various nursing homes spreading Christmas cheer to its residents.

“We are here to celebrate the golden age, our senior saints, to give them fruit baskets and to let them know that we care and that there is somebody that is not even related to them that cares and loves them, so this is our way of giving back,” stated Samuel Merriweather, Pastor of the Community Outreach Church.

The first stop for the church members was the Golden Living Center where they sang Christmas Carols. Then dressed in Santa’s Hats and Reindeer antlers members of Community Outreach Church began handing out bags of fruits and candy canes to the residents of Golden Living and Pastor Merriweather says it is a blessing to give back to the community.

“When we pass it out to the elders, when they look at you in your face and say god bless your son or god bless your daughter that is the most important thing in our life because they mean it, they really mean when they say god bless you and that is a thrill and that is a happiness that you never forget in your life,” stated Pastor Merriweather.

Once they finished giving out the Christmas gift bags, members of the church wished and prayed with the residents before they moved on to the next nursing home to brighten someone else’s day.

“We just want to say Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to everybody,” stated the Church Members.
