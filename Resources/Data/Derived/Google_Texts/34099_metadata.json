Hospitals must also create and publicize financial assistance criteria and ways to apply, and abide by reasonable billing and collection requirements.\n\n\u201cCharitable hospitals are prohibited from engaging in certain collection methods (for example, reporting a debt to a credit agency or garnishing wages) until they make reasonable efforts to determine whether an individual is eligible for assistance under the hospital\u2019s financial assistance policy,\u201d wrote deputy assistant secretary for tax policy Emily McMahon in a summary.\n\nUnder the regulations, charitable hospitals have to perform a community health needs assessment at least once every three years, and disclose the programs addressing those needs in annual tax forms with the IRS.\n\nThe final regulations adopt most of the same framework from proposed regulations \u201cbut simplify the compliance process for charitable hospitals,\u201d McMahon said.\n\nThe regulations also require that financial assistance policies be translated into languages used by 5 percent of the community\u2019s population or at least 1,000 individuals, whichever is less. An earlier proposal called for translations of languages used by at least 10 percent of the population.\n\nThe regulations revise financial assistance notification standards, requiring that a hospital\u2019s assistance policies appear on bills and throughout the facilities, while only requiring written and oral notifications when aggresive collections actions are used, such as reporting debt or trying to garnish wages.\n\nIn general, the rules should not be difficult to adhere to, McMahon said. \u201cWhile charitable hospitals must continue to make a good-faith effort to comply, the rules provide charitable hospitals with adequate time to fully update their policies and programming to implement the changes.\u201d\n\nCharitable hospitals that fail to properly take a community health needs assessment or adopt an implementation strategy will have to pay an excise tax.\n\nHowever, \u201cIf a charitable hospital fails to meet the consumer protection provisions required by the law, the hospital could have its tax-exempt status revoked,\u201d McMahon said.\n\nNonprofit, charitable hospitals represent more than half of America\u2019s hospitals, and \u201cplay a key role in improving the health of the communities they serve,\u201d said McMahon, a former tax partner at Sullivan & Cromwell.\n\n\u201cBut reports that some charitable hospitals have used aggressive debt collection practices, including allowing debt collectors to pursue collections in emergency rooms, have highlighted the need for clear rules to protect patients. For hospitals to be tax-exempt, they should be held to a higher standard.\u201d\n\nUncompensated care and bad debt have been problems for hospitals, patients, payers and state and federal governments for decades \u2014 shifting costs around the system and at times shutting people out of access to healthcare.\n\nFor years, patient advocates have criticized billing and collections tactics by some hospitals that have left uninsured and low-income patients with huge debts for healthcare services. The rise of high deductible health plans in the 2000s caused more middle-income patients to fight three- and four figure bills, or not pay them at all.\n\nAfter the Great Recession, the trend has only grown, with an American public increasingly in-tune to their healthcare\u2019s arcane and opaque pricing rituals, while paying more and more out-of-pocket for health plans.\n\nHospitals and health systems, meanwhile, still have to get paid \u2014 and like other businesses are turning to debt collection. In 2013,10 percent of all U.S. workers paid some of their earnings to debt through wage garnishment, according to a new ADP payroll survey conducted for NPR and ProPublica.\n\nAn investigation by NPR and and ProPublica found that hospitals\u2019 use of wage garnishment is \u201cwidespread,\u201d in Alabama, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma.\n\nWhile an individual's garnishment collection is generally limited to 25 percent of income, wage garnishment by healthcare providers are increasingly under scrutiny by the public, regulators and hospital leaders, including, boards of directors. In Alabama, one large public hospital is under fire for suing low-income patients to recoup unpaid bills.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/new-affordable-care-act-rules-target-aggressive-billing-collections", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/billing-statement-feature_0.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Under the regulations, charitable hospitals have to perform a community health needs assessment at least once every three years, and disclose the programs addressing those needs in annual tax forms with the IRS.", "title": "ACA regs try to tame patient collections"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/billing-statement-feature_0.gif"}, "title": "ACA regs try to tame patient collections", "description": "Under the regulations, charitable hospitals have to perform a community health needs assessment at least once every three years, and disclose the programs addressing those needs in annual tax forms with the IRS.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HC_Finance"}, "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no", "description": "The federal government just took aim at hospitals aggressively billing low and middle-income patients.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee43\"", "article_summary": "The final regulations adopt most of the same framework from proposed regulations \u201cbut simplify the compliance process for charitable hospitals,\u201d McMahon said.\nHospitals must also create and publicize financial assistance criteria and ways to apply, and abide by reasonable billing and collection requirements.\n\u201cBut reports that some charitable hospitals have used aggressive debt collection practices, including allowing debt collectors to pursue collections in emergency rooms, have highlighted the need for clear rules to protect patients.\nHospitals and health systems, meanwhile, still have to get paid \u2014 and like other businesses are turning to debt collection.\nThe regulations require charitable hospitals to limit charges for financial assistance-eligible patients and the uninsured to general rates for private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid."}
