A 31-year-old man is in critical condition after a head-on crash involving a pickup truck and an RTD bus on Interstate 225 early Saturday morning, officials said.

Landon Jo Sieg, got on the highway driving a white Ford F-150 pickup truck at an unknown location going northbound in the southbound lanes of I-225, said Lt. Michael McClelland, spokesman for the Aurora Police Department. The bus was southbound on I-225.

“The truck ended up hitting the bus head on,” McClelland said.

Sieg, who’s being treated at Medical Center of Aurora South, has been issued a state summons for DUI, driving on the wrong side of the roadway, careless driving and no proof of insurance, McClelland said. He’s been convicted of two prior DUI’s in other states.

The bus driver and co-driver, the only occupants on the bus, sustained minor injuries, according to Aurora Fire Rescue. McClelland said Danish Ausler and Barbara Allison were treated for their injuries and released.

The crash happened on southbound I-225 at Alameda Avenue, Aurora Fire Rescue tweeted at 3:47 a.m.

All lanes of southbound I-225 from East Alameda Avenue were reopened about four hours after the crash after the Aurora Police Department and RTD investigated the crash.
