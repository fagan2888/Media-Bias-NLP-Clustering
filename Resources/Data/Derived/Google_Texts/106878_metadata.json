There certainly hasn\u2019t been one delivered through my letterbox.\n\nSo against all this, the NHS has blinked first and now states:\n\n\u201cTo ensure that the concerns are met, NHS England will begin collecting data from GP surgeries in the autumn, instead of April, to allow more time to build understanding of the benefits of using the information, what safeguards are in place, and how people can opt out if they choose to.\u201d\n\nThe final straw may well have been the intervention by the government\u2019s own Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO) which monitors and manages data protection regulations across both the private and public sectors. In a damning statement, the ICO warned:\n\n\u201cThe NHS themselves have introduced an opt-out \u2013 it\u2019s not an opt-out under the Data Protection Act \u2013 but even so they\u2019re still obliged to let people know about it, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at. Our role is to see whether patients are being made aware of what\u2019s happening to their records and the fact that they can opt out if they want to. We feel that the opt-out itself has not been explained as clearly as we were told it would be by NHS officials.\u201d\n\nNick Pickles, director of privacy campaigner Big Brother Watch, said:\n\n\u201cNHS England has failed to properly communicate to patients or GPs what this new database involves, how it affects our medical records and what the risks are. \u201cThe scheme\u2019s benefits are no justification for not properly informing people what will happen and a delay is the right thing to do. Our medical records contain some of our most private information and any changes to how they are used should not be rushed into.\u201d\n\nVerdict\n\nThe prognosis for this whole scheme is now looking less certain.\n\nThe research and innovation benefits of a properly managed data sharing scheme are obvious, but as is so often the case the roll out has been mishandled and rushed through seemingly without due care and attention.\n\nThe UK government should have known better: the uproar among the media when prior to the last national elections Prime Minister David Cameron loosely floated the idea of putting patient records into a Google cloud should have been warning enough that when it comes to matters of personal data and the NHS, politicians need to tread incredibly carefully.\n\nThe six month stay of execution on the scheme is welcome, but it is to be hoped that the time is spent well and on re-evaluating the approach that needs to be taken.\n\nIn a follow up to this piece, guest contributor Graham Sadd offers a personal opinion on this latest NHS debacle based on ten years of lobbying on just this topic.", "article_metadata": {"contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"It's not just Obamacare - diagnosing the UK's health data debacle\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/diginomica.com\\/2014\\/02\\/21\\/obamacare-diagnosing-uks-health-data-debacle\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-02-21 04:13:28\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-02-21 04:18:08\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":4831,\"author_id\":\"7\",\"author_name\":\"Stuart Lauchlan\",\"author_display_name\":\"Stuart Lauchlan\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Security\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/diginomica.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2014\\/02\\/big-brother-19841.jpg\"}", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "diginomica", "description": "The research and innovation benefits of a properly managed healthcare data sharing scheme are obvious, but as is so often the case the roll out of care.data has been mishandled and rushed through seemingly without due care and attention.", "title": "It's not just Obamacare - diagnosing the UK's health data debacle", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://16315-presscdn-0-27.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/big-brother-19841.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-02-21T04:18:08+00:00", "url": "http://diginomica.com/2014/02/21/obamacare-diagnosing-uks-health-data-debacle/", "type": "article"}, "bt": {"category": "Security", "id": "page-4831", "pubDate": "2014-02-21T04:13:28+00:00", "modDate": "2014-02-21T04:18:08+00:00"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "article": {"section": "Security", "published_time": "2014-02-21T04:13:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-21T04:18:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd22ef\"", "article_summary": "Care.data is pitched by its advocates as a giant database of medical records showing how individuals have been cared for across the GP and hospital sectors.\nPrivacy campaigners warned that putting all this information in one place is an open invitation for data protection and data leakage problems.\nEqually controversially there is also a proposal to allow non-NHS organisations, including private sector firms, the right to ask for access to the data.\nBut just to prove that there\u2019s always more to be had from the same deep pool, the UK government has just pulled off an embarrassing climbdown from a controversial scheme for data sharing of medical records.\nUnder plans to digitise the NHS in England and make anonymised medical data available for wider use, the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) planned to start accumulating data from doctors and public health bodies from April and to store this in a new database, known as \u2018care.data\u2019."}
