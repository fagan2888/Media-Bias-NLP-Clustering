Slavery had just been abolished by the 13th Amendment as an institution three years prior, and now black people were finally being recognized as humans and citizens by the law. Of course, no one needs a law to affirm anyone\u2019s humanity, but I\u2019m glad, as a person of African descent, that legislation caught up with common sense.\n\nBut sadly, the 14th Amendment has been a victim of deteriorating common sense in this country allowing nearly everything to become legal under this race-based Reconstruction Amendment.\n\nDue process. Equal protection under the law. These two phrases have become both a battering ram for judicial activists to obliterate our actual Constitutional freedoms and a magic wand to conjure up \u201crights\u201d out of thin air. Federal judges are quite adept at this abuse. The Supreme Court, at least the majority of it, has mastered the art of Constitutional mutilation.\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy took great pride in his assault on the 14th Amendment in the outrageous Obergefell v. Hodges ruling. Writing the majority opinion, Kennedy contorted the civil rights law to purport \u201c\u2026these liberties extend to certain personal choices central to individual dignity and autonomy, including intimate choices that define personal identity and beliefs\u201d. And bippity boppity boo\u2026a new \u201cright\u201d popped into existence.\n\nThis very ruling tramples individual dignity and autonomy, forcing every American (who logically believes that marriage is a biologically complementary institution) to accept, promote, and participate in this magical new right. The Supreme Court has now declared that \u201cSexual Freedom\u201d trumps the First Amendment. The framers of the Constitution must have understood that those silly rights enumerated first, in this unique historical document, would eventually have to submit and be dominated by Sexual Liberties.\n\nAnd all of this was made possible by simply manipulating the 14th Amendment. Funny thing how long it hid this \u201cright\u201d to same-sex \u201cmarriage\u201d all these years. It just took the poetic justice of liberal Supreme Court justices to find it buried beneath years of \u201cbigotry\u201d and \u201chate\u201d.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s about the children even though LGBT attorneys demanded that marriage is not about children. Justice Kennedy wrote about \u201chundreds of thousands of children\u201d being currently raised by same-sex couples as well as making the following statistic-free statement about adoption and foster care: \u201c\u2026many adopted and foster children have same-sex parents.\u201d Less than 4% of adopted and foster children are cared for by same-sex couples, but sure, let\u2019s make it \u201cmany\u201d. In fact, less than .2% of all 61 million U.S. marriages are same-sex couples, but they need their \u201cdue process\u201d and \u201cequal protection\u201d even if it means shredding the law to get there. Well, bigamists, polygamists, and any polyamorous or polysexual relationship will need their \u201cindividual dignity and autonomy\u201d too.\n\nUnlike the reason for the passage of the 14th Amendment (which was based upon the inarguable immutable characteristic of skin color), Kennedy\u2019s false assertion of the \u201cimmutable characteristic\u201d of homosexuality was akin to Justice Harry Blackmun\u2019s remarks in Roe v. Wade. \u201cWe need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man's knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.\u201d Blackmun lied, pretending that biological sciences had not already clearly determined this fact over a hundred years prior. No embryologist had any doubt. Science knew, without question, that life begins at conception. Even the former president of Planned Parenthood and the Guttmacher Institute\u2019s namesake, Alan F. Guttmacher, declared in his 1933 book \"Life In The Making\": \u201cThis all seems so simple and evident that it is difficult to picture a time when it wasn't part of the common knowledge.\u201d But Supreme Court Justices, content with not only taking on the powers of the legislative branch of government, also regard themselves as scientific authorities.\n\nThe 14th Amendment is not a panacea. It was appropriately invoked in Loving v. Virginia because the issue was a racist anti-miscegenation law banning interracial marriage\u2014an issue based on race. I\u2019m interracially married, so I\u2019m grateful that the Supreme Court ruled based upon the law. It never should have taken nearly 100 years for America to get that right.\n\nBut I have deep concerns for our Supreme Court justices who think they\u2019re fooling the American public. They\u2019ve flaunted their disdain of their constitutional limits. Interpret people. Don\u2019t improvise. Surprisingly Chief Justice John Roberts got it right in Obergefell v. Hodges, but just a ruling prior sided with the liberal court in rewriting Obamacare in King v. Burwell. Luckily, Roberts and the others who ruled in favor of this unconstitutional wreck of a 20,000+ page law (including regulations) don\u2019t have to worry about having their heads checked by Obamacare doctors. The Supreme Court and its staff don\u2019t have to enroll in Obamacare. They are exempt. Equal protection under the law is such a convenient weapon. They\u2019re not subject to the same (oppressive) rules that average folks like us are. That would be so\u2026what\u2019s the word\u2026constitutional.\n\nBut these elitists judges (and the clerks writing for them) can randomly choose to wield \u201cdue process\u201d and \u201cequal protection\u201d when they want to force inequality upon the American public.\n\nHappy Birthday, 14th Amendment.
