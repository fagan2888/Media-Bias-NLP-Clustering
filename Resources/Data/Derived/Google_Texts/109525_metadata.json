But the document Camp put out goes further than eliminating the carried interest loophole.\n\n\u201cToday, Wall Street tycoons and executives of leading non-profit entities and institutions receive compensation packages riddled with special tax-exempt treatment \u2013 courtesy of hardworking taxpayers,\u201d it reads.\n\nCamp\u2019s proposal would eliminate the ability of businesses to take tax deductions when they pay executive bonuses in stock, rather than cash, which could not be written off. It restricts the ability of highly paid executives to shelter money from taxation through deferred compensation arrangements.\n\nThe proposal would require Wall Street firms to disclose the value of derivatives and other complex financial instruments on a \u201cmarket-to-market\u201d basis for tax purposes \u2013 a move sure to trouble investment banks and complex financial institutions.\n\nRelated: Tax Reform Proposal Divides Republicans\n\nAnd finally, Camp would eliminate the tax loophole that allows special depreciation rules for corporate jets.\n\nThe carried interest rule, though, is attracting the most attention.\n\nCarried interest refers to a form of compensation paid to hedge fund and private equity fund managers. Typically, it represents a percentage of a fund\u2019s profits over a specified \u201churdle\u201d level. For instance, a fund manager might be guaranteed 20 percent of all profits above an 8 percent annual rate of return.\n\nCurrently, carried interest payments are taxed at the capital gains rate, rather than the higher rate reserved for regular income. The justification for having a lower rate on capital gains is that it encourages investment. But critics of the carried interest loophole point out that in many cases, the people receiving carried interest compensation don\u2019t actually have their own capital at risk.\n\nRelated: Corporate Tax Reform \u2013 The One Big Fix Congress Could Get Done This Year\n\nThe hedge fund and private equity community clearly disagree, and on Wednesday, Steve Judge, President and CEO of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, released a statement slamming Camp\u2019s proposal.\n\n\u201cLast year, private equity invested over 400 billion dollars in thousands of businesses of all shapes and sizes across all 435 congressional districts. This is why it is so disappointing that Chairman Camp chose to single out private equity investment by exacting a 40 percent tax increase that will discourage new investment. Key policymakers from both parties have already made clear that the discussion around this draft proposal will be brief.\n\nNevertheless, Chairman Camp\u2019s proposal penalizes long-term capital investment, which he and other members of the House Ways and Means Committee have purported to support. It is our hope that as the debate over tax reform unfolds, policymakers will utilize the opportunity to reform the tax code as a way to encourage, not undermine, capital investment in America.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Camp seemed unconcerned by the barrage of criticism.\n\n\u201cI think we take a commonsense approach to where the activity is more like wage income and can be reported and taxed as income,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s an appropriate reform.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In the face of anger from Wall Street, Rep.
