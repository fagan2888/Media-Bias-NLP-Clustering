But Sean Hannity ate it up.\n\nKlein, who has a new anti-Hillary book out, has become a regular Hannity guest of late \u2013 despite the fact that Hannity\u2019s own Fox News colleagues questioned Klein's credibility. But even if you don\u2019t know that Klein\u2019s previous writings contain the kind of laughable allegations that Chelsea Clinton was conceived when Bill raped Hillary, you\u2019d have to take what Klein alleged last night with a shaker of salt.\n\nDuring the discussion, Hannity \u201crevealed\u201d that \u201ca very prominent person\u201d who had been watching Klein on Hannity the previous week had confided that, \u201cEverything that Ed Klein says that Bill Clinton said, he has said to me. Multiple times. Bill Clinton does not like Barack Obama. He loathes him.\u201d\n\nNow, what kind of \u201cvery prominent person\u201d (so prominent that Hannity said it twice) who would have that kind of inside information about the Clintons would also spill the beans to the likes of Hannity about it: Chelsea Clinton? John Kerry? Or was it Clinton \u201cbestie\u201d Dick Cheney? Don't make me laugh.\n\nWhoever it was must have the same kind of Clinton pipeline as Klein. He agreed:\n\n(Clinton) has called him the man he hates most in the whole world. \u2026Bill has been checking with state chairmen, Democratic state chairmen all across the United States about what Obama is up to. And he\u2019s come to the conclusion that Obama\u2019s looking for a Mini-Me, a clone of himself to make sure that Hillary doesn\u2019t get the nomination. So Bill feels that his biggest enemy is Barack Obama.\n\nIf Obama is Clinton\u2019s biggest enemy then why did Bill Clinton do such a tremendous job helping to re-elect President Obama? Why would Bill commend Obama over ObamaCare? Why would Hillary agree to become Secretary of State in the Obama administration? I have no doubt Obama and Bill are not close but there\u2019s a big difference between that and the kind of enmity Klein and Hannity described.\n\nAnd again, who in a position to know would be talking to Klein?\n\n\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Hannity responded to Klein\u2019s \u201crevelation.\u201d\n\nWhich may be the one true thing said in the discussion.\n\nI fully expect Klein to be offered a job at Fox if Hillary Clinton runs.\n\nWatch Hannity and Klein claim to have sources among the Clintons below.", "article_metadata": {"csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "google-site-verification": "google51c0b549f514d464.html", "csrf-token": "BlgFVA3lhhVLJrRwnmmRbXCxHZBxBZHP8S4l/Yx07xM=", "og": {"url": "http://www.newshounds.us/discredited_author_and_hillary_hater_ed_klein_claims_bill_clinton_feels_that_his_biggest_enemy_is_barack_obama_07022014", "site_name": "NewsHounds", "image": "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/newshounds/sites/1/meta_images/original/Newshound3_blue.png?1327001871", "type": "article", "title": "Discredited Author \u2013 And Hillary Hater \u2013 Ed Klein Claims Bill Clinton \u2018Feels That His Biggest Enemy Is Barack Obama\u2019"}, "Title": "Discredited Author \u2013 And Hillary Hater \u2013 Ed Klein Claims Bill Clinton \u2018Feels That His Biggest Enemy Is Barack Obama\u2019"}, "article_summary": "If Obama is Clinton\u2019s biggest enemy then why did Bill Clinton do such a tremendous job helping to re-elect President Obama?\nI fully expect Klein to be offered a job at Fox if Hillary Clinton runs.\nBill Clinton does not like Barack Obama.\n\u2026Bill has been checking with state chairmen, Democratic state chairmen all across the United States about what Obama is up to.\nSo Bill feels that his biggest enemy is Barack Obama."}
