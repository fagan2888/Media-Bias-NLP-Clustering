Bush signed the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. They said those cuts have continued under President Barack Obama\u2019s administration with the Affordable Care Act of 2010.\n\nThe competitive bidding process for companies receiving reimbursement under Medicare is meant to reduce federal spending on healthcare and save taxpayer money. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services website, those efforts are expected to save Medicare over $26.8 billion over 10 years.\n\nBut the medical device providers at the meeting Friday said the reimbursement rates being implemented by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are causing their businesses to be pushed to the limit.\n\nSeveral of the business owners said they had to reduce the number of people they employ and, in some cases, had to close regional offices. They said they don\u2019t understand why parts of the state, like Boone and Wayne counties, are designated as urban communities, which reduces the Medicare reimbursement rates received in those areas.\n\nThe business owners said that spending on home health services in West Virginia was comparatively higher than some locations in the country because of the large elderly population and the state\u2019s low standard of health overall.\n\nMany of the home medical providers believe they are being adversely targeted by the federal government and argued that by providing health services in people\u2019s homes, their businesses are saving the federal government money by not having those patients admitted to hospitals or nursing homes.\n\n\u201cWhy are they coming after us? Because we don\u2019t have paid lobbyists,\u201d said Regina Gillispie, owner and president of Best Home Medical, a Barboursville-based home medical supplier.\n\nThe West Virginia Medical Equipment Suppliers Association is part of the American Association for Homecare, a national lobbying group in Washington D.C.\n\nGillispie, who pushed for the meeting Friday, said she had been to Washington on numerous occasions and contacted Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s and Sen. Shelley Moore Capito\u2019s offices about her concerns.\n\nIn the past couple of years, Gillispie said she lost the federal bidding process to be a federally-approved Medicare provider in the Barboursville area, which is now served by larger national companies. As a result, Gillispie said she opened up a different office in Nitro, where she was able to treat Medicare recipients.\n\nEugene Weems, the president of Boll Medical in Charleston and the president of the state\u2019s medical equipment suppliers, said the association\u2019s members have to deal with a lot, especially in rural areas, including delivery of equipment, home assessments, equipment setup and installation, insurance verification, writing clinical notes to obtain the equipment and being on call around the clock.\n\nWeems understands the impetus behind the Medicare reimbursement cuts, which he believes stems from some prominent fraud cases, but he said the new cuts are making it difficult to even provide the home health services to West Virginians.\n\nTwelve years ago, Weems said his company employed around 89 people who traveled to people\u2019s homes providing care, but now his staff is down to 35 people, largely because of reimbursement cuts, he said.\n\nWeems said in-home oxygen service costs the federal government around $10 a day, but if that patient had to be hospitalized, it would cost $4,500 to $5,000.\n\nState Senator Tom Takubo, R-Kanawha, spoke during the meeting in support of the medical device providers. Takubo, a pulmonologist who sees patients with lung disease, said the home care services are essential in southern West Virginia, which has high rates of smoking and many former and current coal miners that suffer from black lung and other respiratory issues.\n\nPatti Todd, the owner of Allay Home Care, based in Beckley, told the federal officials that parts of West Virginia, especially Boone County, being designated as an urban region showed that the reimbursement system was flawed.\n\nShe explained that many of the patients she serves may only be 30 miles away from her office, but it can often take more than an hour on winding back-country roads to reach their homes.\n\n\u201cMost of our patients just don\u2019t live in town,\u201d she said.\n\nTodd said the reimbursement cuts need to end.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing left to cut,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s to the bone.\u201d\n\nReach Andrew Brown at andrew.brown@wvgazettemail.com,\n\n304-348-4814 or follow @Andy_Ed_Brown on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "title": "Gazette-Mail debuts new look to website", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160526/GZ03/160529657/AR/0/AR-160529657.jpg", "url": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/news-business/20160526/gazette-mail-debuts-new-look-to-website", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Charleston Gazette-Mail", "description": "See attached", "title": "Gazette-Mail debuts new look to website", "image": {"src": "http://www.wvgazettemail.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CH/20160526/GZ03/160529657/AR/0/AR-160529657.jpg"}, "creator": "@wvgazettemail", "site": "@wvgazettemail", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/charlestongazettemail"}, "google-site-verification": "1bw05nOwAmeGwNrWfrMp361tiStYbQbOwqqj_P_-LVA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "dc.title": "Gazette-Mail debuts new look to website"}, "article_summary": "The healthcare officials explained that they have continued to feel the effects of Medicare reimbursement cuts since the early 2000s when President George W.
