IT WAS ABOUT CONTROL. >> PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEALTH CARE WHO DIDN'T HAVE IT BEFORE I SUSPECT WOULD DISAGREE STRONGLY WITH YOU, BUT I WONDER IN ADDITION IS THAT REALLY HOW YOU WANTED TO BE DEFINED? HOW YOU WANT TO PUT GOVERNMENT ON TRIAL IN A POLITICAL WAY? >> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, RECOGNIZE WHAT I SAID, WORSE THING SINCE SLAVERY, DIDN'T SAY THAT IT WAS SLAVERY. PEOPLE WHO ARE WELL-READ AND PARTICULARLY -- >> YOU SAID IT IS SLAVERY IN A WAY BECAUSE IT IS MAKING US ALL SUBSERVIENT TO THE GOVERNMENT. >> RIGHT. >> THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID. >> AND I SAID IN A WAY. IN A WAY ANYTHING IS SLAVERY THAT ROBS YOU OF YOUR ABILITY TO CONTROL YOUR OWN LIFE. AND WHEN YOU TAKE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU HAVE, WHICH IS YOUR HEALTH CARE, AND YOU PUT THAT IN THE HANDS OF GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS, I THINK YOU HAVE DONE THE WRONG THING, AND AS I WAS ABOUT TO SAY, YOU GO BACK AND YOU LOOK AT THE NEOMARXIST LITERATURE AND LOOK AT WHAT THEY SAY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY, ABOUT TAKING CONTROL OF HEALTH CARE OF THE POPULACE AND MAKING THE PEOPLE DEPENDENT. THIS IS NOT WHAT AMERICA IS ABOUT. DO I BELIEVE IN HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYBODY? ABSOLUTELY. BUT I THINK THERE ARE MUCH BETTER WAYS TO GET THERE WHICH LEAVE THE CARE IN THE HANDS OF PATIENTS AND OF DOCTORS.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Meet the Press, Dr. Ben Carson addresses comments he made in the past about Obamacare and slavery.", "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "description": "On Meet the Press, Dr. Ben Carson addresses comments he made in the past about Obamacare and slavery.", "title": "Carson Talks Obamacare and Slavery", "url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/meet-the-press/carson-talks-obamacare-and-slavery-259434051709", "image": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/mtp_10bc_slave_140518.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "On Meet the Press, Dr. Ben Carson addresses comments he made in the past about Obamacare and slavery.", "title": "Carson Talks Obamacare and Slavery", "image": {"src": "http://media2.s-nbcnews.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/mtp_10bc_slave_140518.jpg"}, "creator": "NBCNews", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "HTML5", "PreferredFormats": "M3U,F4M,MPEG4"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/watch/meet-the-press/carson-talks-obamacare-and-slavery-259434051709", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5a2d\"", "article_summary": ">> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, RECOGNIZE WHAT I SAID, WORSE THING SINCE SLAVERY, DIDN'T SAY THAT IT WAS SLAVERY.\n>> PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEALTH CARE WHO DIDN'T HAVE IT BEFORE I SUSPECT WOULD DISAGREE STRONGLY WITH YOU, BUT I WONDER IN ADDITION IS THAT REALLY HOW YOU WANTED TO BE DEFINED?\nDO I BELIEVE IN HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYBODY?\nPEOPLE WHO ARE WELL-READ AND PARTICULARLY -- >> YOU SAID IT IS SLAVERY IN A WAY BECAUSE IT IS MAKING US ALL SUBSERVIENT TO THE GOVERNMENT.\nIN A WAY ANYTHING IS SLAVERY THAT ROBS YOU OF YOUR ABILITY TO CONTROL YOUR OWN LIFE."}
