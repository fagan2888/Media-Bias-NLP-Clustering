Charles McBurney clinched a victory in the Republican primary for the District 16 state House of Representatives race.

McBurney defeated political newcomer Chris Oliver for the seat and is the popular candidate for the November election. McBurney will face write-in candidate Brunell William Martineau.

Barring an underdog win from Martineau, who has not raised any campaign contributions, Tuesday’s results means McBurney will keep his seat in the state House.

McBurney said he’ll focus on dealing with issues of state fiscal responsibility and federal encroachment on state issues during his next term, particularly dealing with aspects of the Affordable Care Act.

He also said he’ll work on public safety initiatives.

“I’m very grateful for the results and the confidence voters have placed in me,” he said.

McBurney held a substantial lead in fundraising and support, particularly from the business community, the months before Tuesday’s election. The district covers swaths of Southside and Mandarin.

McBurney, the incumbent, is the chairman of the House’s Justice Appropriations subcommittee and other influential committees.

He was an assistant state attorney under Ed Austin and later worked in private practice law. He was elected to the state House of Representatives in 2007 and was previously re-elected three times, twice of which were unopposed races.

Oliver is a Navy veteran and has lived in Jacksonville since 2008. He is currently a candidate for Juris Doctor at Florida Coastal School of Law.

McBurney raised $169,730 in monetary donations during his campaign.

Oliver raised $6,740 in monetary donations during his campaign.
