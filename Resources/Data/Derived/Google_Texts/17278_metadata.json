Based in Livonia, Mich., the Catholic health care provider boasts operations in 21 states, which includes 90 hospitals and 120 long-term care facilities. For this last, Trinity should be lauded.\n\nFor the first, however, your writer is left shaking his head.\n\nAmong Trinity\u2019s list of five shareholder advocacy priorities, two stand out:\n\n\u2022 uphold the dignity of the human person.\n\n\u2022 enable access to health care.\n\nIn other words, issues any reasonable Catholic could get behind. However, Trinity is the lead filer on a proxy resolution that will be voted on next month at the Allergan, Inc., annual shareholders meeting. The cause? Read for yourself:\n\n*RESOLVED*, the stockholders of Allergan request the preparation of a report, updated annually, disclosing: 1. Company policy and procedures governing lobbying, both direct and indirect, and grassroots lobbying communications. 2. Payments by Allergan used for (a) direct or indirect lobbying or (b) grassroots lobbying communications, in each case including the amount of the payment and the recipient. 3. Allergan\u2019s membership in and payments to any tax-exempt organization that writes and endorses model legislation.\n\nYour writer fails to understand how any of the above reconciles with Trinity\u2019s five priorities listed above, and Trinity\u2019s rationale doesn\u2019t get any less murky:\n\nFor purposes of this proposal, a \u201cgrassroots lobbying communication\u201d is a communication directed to the general public that (a) refers to specific legislation or regulation, (b) reflects a view on the legislation or regulation and (c) encourages the recipient of the communication to take action with respect to the legislation or regulation. \u201cIndirect lobbying\u201d is lobbying engaged in by a trade association or other organization of which Allergan is a member. Both \u201cdirect and indirect lobbying\u201d and \u201cgrassroots lobbying communications\u201d include efforts at the local, state and federal levels. \u201cBut,\u201d readers may ask, \u201cwhy?\u201d For the most part ignoring all five of its own priorities, Trinity\u2019s resolution continues: *Supporting Statement*: As stockholders, we encourage transparency and accountability in the use of corporate funds to influence legislation and regulation both directly and indirectly. Allergan spent $4.03 million in 2011 and 2012 on direct federal lobbying activities (opensecrets.org). These figures do not include lobbying expenditures to influence legislation in states, where Allergan also lobbies but disclosure is uneven or absent. For example, AbbVie spent $405,685 on lobbying in California in 2013 and 2014 (http://cal-access.ss.ca.gov/). Allergan\u2019s lobbying on tax inversions has attracted media scrutiny (\u201cPfizer-Allergan Deal May Revive Inversions Fury,\u201d Politico, Oct. 30, 2015). We commend Allergan for ending its membership in the American Legislative Exchange Council [ALEC] in 2015. However, serious disclosure gaps remain. Allergan lists its membership of the Biotechnology Industry Organization (\u201cBIO\u201d). In 2013 and 2014, BIO spent $16.25 million on lobbying. Allergan is also a member of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), but does not disclose this. PhRMA spent over $34.5 million on lobbying in 2013 and 2014. Allergan does not fully disclose its trade association memberships, nor payments and the portions used for lobbying on its website. Absent a system of accountability, company assets could be used for objectives contrary to Allergan\u2019s long-term interests.\n\nLet\u2019s see if we can get this straight: Trinity presumes to know what type of lobbying is in Allergan\u2019s best interests, but Allergan may not? Readers are free to hold any opinions they prefer regarding corporate tax inversions, but, ultimately, wouldn\u2019t shareholder value benefit from the, currently at least, completely legal practice?\n\nAs for ALEC and the lobbying groups with which Allergan is associated, it shouldn\u2019t be terribly surprising that a pharmaceutical company would want a voice in the political sphere given the medical-industry confusion and turmoil wrought by ObamaCare \u2013 unless Trinity Health is onboard with the Affordable Care Act as it stands today, or wishes it legislatively morph into a single-payer system.\n\nLet\u2019s test that hypothesis, shall we? After the June 2015 Supreme Court determination that reinterpreted (called \u201cinterpretive jiggery-pokery\u201d by Justice Antonin Scalia) the actual text of the ACA, Trinity Health released the following press statement:\n\nTrinity Health is celebrating today\u2019s decision as a victory for the working people and is thankful for the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s acknowledgement that \u201cCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them.\u201d We believe that a people-centered health system starts with access to high-quality health insurance for all and today\u2019s ruling from SCOTUS supports that access and all the work we have done to start this important transformation of our nation\u2019s health care delivery system. We are glad to be moving forward today as a country making excellent strides toward creating a health care system that works for everyone and puts people at the center.\n\nAhhhh! Very revealing! Isn\u2019t it funny how Trinity\u2019s resolution calling for more corporate transparency from Allergan doesn\u2019t include transparency of Trinity\u2019s own agenda, which is all-in support of ObamaCare? As well, isn\u2019t it also funny that Trinity is opposed to groups less-than enthusiastic about ACA, including ALEC and other groups once or currently receiving Allergan funds? Except \u2026 it\u2019s not funny in the slightest inasmuch it carries more than a faint whiff of hypocrisy. From, it must be remembered, an entity consisting of 90 hospitals and 120 care facilities, and \u2013 not coincidentally \u2013 a member of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility as well as frequent collaborator on resolutions filed with As You Sow, both of which are nominally religious but actually progressive shareholder activist groups.\n\nFor its part, Allergan\u2019s board of directors unanimously recommends shareholders vote against the Trinity Health resolution next month:\n\nWe are committed to participating constructively in the political process and engaging in such participation in full with applicable laws. Allergan recognizes that informed public policy is a critical factor in achieving its goal of pursuing medical advances to help patients live life to their fullest potential. Therefore, the Specified Allergan U.S. Subsidiaries engage in various efforts to advance public policies that support healthcare innovation and improve patient access to needed medical treatments while also recognizing that a fair, free market system provides the best atmosphere for continued innovation. These efforts by the Specified Allergan U.S. Subsidiaries include sponsoring a federal political action committee, contributing to state and local candidates and committees and supporting industry and trade organizations. The policies and procedures we have already put into place are designed to ensure that all lobbying activities conducted by our company and our employees comply with all applicable laws. \u2026 The implementation of the proposal\u2019s additional requirements would result in the unproductive consumption of valuable time and corporate resources tracking insignificant activities without materially enhancing existing disclosures. (p. 58)\n\nTo this reader, Allergan\u2019s response seems more concerned with enabling access to health care and upholding human dignity than Trinity\u2019s progressive-themed resolution. It also reflects Allergan\u2019s greater concern for shareholder value than that possessed by Trinity Health.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On its website, Trinity Health trumpets its shareholder activism.
