( Mel Melcon/L.A. Times via Getty Images )\n\nKavita Ramchandani loved everything about evenings in her backyard: how the full moon lit up the sky, the way the breeze seemed to talk to her, the smell of the pine trees. She bought the single-story hillside house in this upscale Los Angeles County suburb after emigrating from India, and from the first night it felt like home.\n\nThen last fall, gas started leaking from a well at a nearby storage facility, and Ramchandani, 53, began wheezing, getting nose bleeds and persistent headaches. She left her home in January.\n\nNow, she says, the house just feels foreign. And scary.\n\nGabriel Khanlian, a 39-year old Porter Ranch resident, said he, too, became really worried after his 2-year-old daughter got a body rash and his sons, 5 and 8, had several bloody noses, stomachaches and burning eyes.\n\nHe started feeling horrible too \u2014 with nausea and body aches. \u201cIt felt like someone was hammering my head,\u201d Khanlian said.\n\nThe Southern California Gas Company announced Feb. 18 that after nearly four months, it had permanently sealed the leaking well, and residents who had evacuated their homes could safely return.\n\nThe gas company, which had been picking up the tab for evacuees staying in hotels and motels, said it would pay for one additional week. But a Superior Court judge ordered the gas company on March 2 to continue paying for the temporary accommodations until March 18, allowing time for more air testing. The company said it has paid about $36 million in relocation expenses for about 3,400 households.\n\nRamchandani said she can\u2019t afford to pay for the hotel once the gas company stops footing the bill, but she fears returning to Porter Ranch. \u201cI\u2019m worried about my health,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat if the breathlessness continues? What will I do then?\u201d\n\nThe massive and unprecedented leak at the Aliso Canyon storage facility prompted Gov. Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency in early January. Criminal charges and civil lawsuits against the gas company followed. Community leaders and politicians demanded more regulation of the aging facilities.\n\nLegislators in Sacramento have jumped into the fray, proposing a bill to require more testing before the company can restart operations.\n\nThe leak has fueled concerns about the long-term health of residents exposed to methane, benzene and other chemicals. As part of his emergency declaration, Brown pledged to convene an independent panel of medical and scientific experts to review potential health risks.\n\nSome residents have reported symptoms such as coughing, dizziness, stomachaches and nausea, according to the Los Angeles County Public Health Department. Department officials have said the symptoms should stop now that the well has been sealed.\n\nBut Ramchandani and others are worried that their health problems will continue \u2014 or worsen \u2014 when they go home. They fear what could happen in the future because of their recent exposure to the gas and chemicals.\n\nHealth officials maintain that the risk of long-term health problems is small. They say the main component in the emissions from the facility was methane, an odorless gas that doesn\u2019t generally cause health problems when inhaled. The storage facility also released mercaptans, pungent smelling gases that are added to make a leak easy to detect.\n\nThe leaking gas also contained benzene \u2014 a carcinogen \u2014 and other related chemicals. But health officials said benzene levels during the leak were no greater in Porter Ranch than in other areas of Los Angeles County.\n\n\u201cWe already have bad air in Los Angeles,\u201d said Cyrus Rangan, who directs the toxicology and environmental assessment bureau for the L.A. County Department of Public Health. \u201cYou\u2019d never say our air is the best in the world overall. But at least we can say we are not looking at levels that are far and above what you would normally breathe here.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment also evaluated air samples collected by the gas company between November and January and determined that none of the potentially harmful compounds in the leaked emissions were at high enough concentrations to pose serious health problems. Any increase in cancer risk to people in Porter Ranch is therefore very small, the office concluded.\n\nRangan said the vast majority of the symptoms are due to the odorants, which can irritate the eyes, skin and respiratory system. He said the emissions are not associated with lasting health problems.\n\nNot everyone is convinced. Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, who lives in Porter Ranch, said he\u2019s concerned that the level of benzene was above standards on at least several days.\n\n\u201cI would guess that this not going to turn out to be as significant as Flint, Michigan, but that is a guess from somebody who didn\u2019t go to medical school,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to plug the well. You\u2019ve got to make sure that the air is pure.\u201d\n\nThe public health department and the South Coast Air Quality Management District are continuing to monitor the air. Residents are also being asked to report ongoing odors.\n\nThis week, the gas company also began assessing homes where residents have reported brown spots that might be residue from the leak.\n\nGas company officials said the residue is not likely to be in many residential air ducts, which are sealed in most homes so outside air does not enter. In the \u201cvery few systems\u201d that do take in some air from the outside, filters should stop particles from circulating in the home, the company said.\n\nMike Danko, an attorney representing Porter Ranch residents in one of the civil lawsuits, said he believes the gas company has understated the impact without strong data. Only time will tell how the leak ultimately affects the residents\u2019 health, he said.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that the bloody noses, the nausea, the skin irritation is going to pass with time,\u201d Danko said. \u201cThe people now have to live under a cloud of what is going to happen 10, 20, 30 years down the road. No one should have to live with that.\u201d\n\nDr. Jeffrey Nordella, medical director at Porter Ranch Quality Care, which provides both primary and urgent care, said he immediately saw an uptick in patients with common symptoms last fall.\n\nNordella said he has been screening patients with blood work, chest x-rays and lung function tests. One morning in late February, Ramchandani came in for a follow-up visit. The Bollywood singer told him she didn\u2019t have a history of breathing problems but that her wheezing had been so bad she had to turn down work.\n\nPulling up her test results, Nordella informed her she had limited lung function. He prescribed an inhaler and suggested a visit to a pulmonologist.\n\nRamchandani is anxious about what is to come. \u201cConstantly at the back of mind, I am thinking, \u2018What if I get cancer?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we need to keep following you,\u201d Nordella told her.\n\nIn a shopping center across the street sit two storefronts set up by the gas company, where residents can request air purifiers and weather stripping. They can also file reimbursement claims and ask a toxicologist questions.\n\nJacki Swift, 53, said she has gone to the center several times to ask for help. After the leak started, she and her family packed up their dog, their clothes and their grandson\u2019s toys and relocated to a rented home in Chatsworth.\n\nSitting on a rented couch in the living room one day last month, Swift said she believed the new house wasn\u2019t far enough away from Porter Ranch. Her headaches have continued, and her daughter continues to get bright red, itchy rashes all over her body, she said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really scary,\u201d Swift said. \u201cI feel like we are guinea pigs.\u201d\n\nEvery time they go to Porter Ranch to get the mail or check on their house, the symptoms get worse, she said.\n\nSwift said she wonders if the gas company knows more than they are saying about the chemicals. \u201cI think they are choosing their words carefully to diminish our fears, to make us feel safe,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t feel safe. I want to know if there are toxins in my home.\u201d\n\nSwift wants to move out of the area but knows that could be difficult because, \u201cwho is going to buy a house in Porter Ranch?\u201d\n\nKhanlian, on the other hand, said he just wants to move back home. He has lived in Porter Ranch for nearly 15 years and owns two homes in the area. He is the secretary of his homeowners\u2019 association and part of a community group called \u201cSave Porter Ranch,\u201d which opposes oil and gas drilling and pre-dates the recent leak.\n\nThe doctors told Khanlian they didn\u2019t know what was causing his family\u2019s symptoms, which he said had begun before the gas company announced the leak. But Khanlian suspected it had something to do with an unbearable smell of gas outside. He told his children they couldn\u2019t ride their bikes or go in the swimming pool.\n\nThen the gas company announced the leak, and Khanlian and his family relocated to Reseda. As the smell subsided, the family moved back in briefly, but left again after Khanlian\u2019s wife, Aleeza, started suffering a recurrence of nausea and headaches. Khanlian wants the gas company to test the soil, water and air.\n\nFrom his front door in Porter Ranch, he can look up at the hill where the once-leaking well sits. He said he expects more problems in the future. \u201cThe whole facility is so outdated,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do we know we aren\u2019t going to have another gas leak?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Khanlian said, he is closely monitoring his family\u2019s symptoms and hoping the officials are right that the health effects of the gas leak will be short-lived.\n\nThis story was produced by Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A month after the leak was sealed, concerns remain about the long-term health of residents exposed to methane, benzene and other chemicals.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Fear Of Future Health Problems Plagues Porter Ranch Gas Leak Victims\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2016\\/03\\/15\\/fear-of-future-health-problems-plagues-porter-ranch-gas-leak-victims\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-03-15 10:24:06\",\"mod_date\":\"2016-03-15 11:28:33\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":160092,\"author_id\":\"80\",\"author_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"author_display_name\":\"Jon Brooks\",\"tags\":[\"environmental health\",\"News\",\"Porter Ranch\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2016\\/03\\/porterranch.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "A month after the leak was sealed, concerns remain about the long-term health of residents exposed to methane, benzene and other chemicals.", "title": "Fear Of Future Health Problems Plagues Porter Ranch Gas Leak Victims", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2016/03/15/fear-of-future-health-problems-plagues-porter-ranch-gas-leak-victims/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2016/03/porter-ranch-6.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "environmental health,news,porter ranch", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "From his front door in Porter Ranch, he can look up at the hill where the once-leaking well sits.\nRamchandani said she can\u2019t afford to pay for the hotel once the gas company stops footing the bill, but she fears returning to Porter Ranch.\nAny increase in cancer risk to people in Porter Ranch is therefore very small, the office concluded.\nHe has lived in Porter Ranch for nearly 15 years and owns two homes in the area.\nA woman walks to her home in Porter Ranch, Calif., last month, after state regulatory officials announced that SoCalGas Co.'s leaking well had finally been plugged."}
