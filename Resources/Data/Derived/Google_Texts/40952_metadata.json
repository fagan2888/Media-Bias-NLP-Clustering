The Obama administration just doesn\u2019t seem to get it. That or they don\u2019t actually care about the people they\u2019re purporting to help.\n\nAfter all, it sure is easy to propose solutions to \u201cincome inequality\u201d when you personally don\u2019t have to suffer the consequences when things don\u2019t go as planned. You get to look like the hero and blame someone else for the resulting fallout from your decisions.\n\nThis week\u2019s entry in the \u201canti-solution in search of a problem\u201d log is the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s new rule governing eligibility for overtime pay. The labor groups are (of course) cheering this move (and will almost certainly seek an exclusion to it) while hardworking Americans have to lap up the union Kool-Aid just to find out it tastes a bit funny going down.\n\nRather than allowing labor markets to function properly and individuals to enter into mutually beneficial compensation agreements with their employers, the benevolent leaders in Washington, D.C. see themselves as knowing more than the 158 million people in the labor force. The rule more than doubles the threshold level of pay for overtime \u2014 from the current $23,660 to $47,476.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering celebrating, we urge you to hold the applause and read the fine print. Lost in the seemingly goodwill gesture will be the \u201cunintended\u201d consequences \u2014 job growth will continue to sag, wages will continue to stagnate, and labor force participation will remain depressed in 1970s figures.\n\nAmericans are rightly frustrated \u2014 look no further than the presidential rallies. Whether people want to earn a better wage, or just find a job at all, their pain and anger are both understandable and warranted. Unfortunately, dictates such as the new overtime rule are part of the problem, masking themselves as part of the solution.\n\nIt is an economic certainty that this particular rule will impact nearly every sector of the U.S. economy. Hotels and restaurants, retail companies, and nonprofits will feel much of the burn. Businesses have already vocalized their concerns, saying this rule will slow their hiring processes, force them to cut hours and pay, and limit benefits packages.\n\nIf you\u2019re mad about all of this, make sure the finger is pointed in the right direction.\n\nWe continue to feel the repercussions of the health care mandate under Obamacare. In recent days, we\u2019ve heard reports of fast-food chains responding to minimum wage increases with human-replacing kiosks. Employers will always be in the business of securing profits, because that is what allows for and expands overall prosperity and success. Success translates into income for the employer, jobs for the employees, and revenue in the form of taxes and charitable gifts that allow for community improvements.\n\nConsider this scenario for just a moment: Would you start a for-profit or nonprofit operation if you knew your dream would be strangled by mandates and regulations forcing you to close your doors?\n\nWe want entrepreneurs to take risks, invest in innovative ideas, and experience success. All of this (we call it the free market) results in the creation of innovative products and services that make our lives better and, you guessed it, create more job opportunities and higher paying positions. This is why capitalism and the free market has been the single greatest anti-poverty program in human history, lifting more than 2 BILLION people out of poverty globally since 1970.\n\nOver the past seven years, the policies of this administration have kept GDP growth to under 3 percent in every single year, and overall job growth to levels well below both Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton \u2014 two Presidents also elected in the aftermath of recessions. The Obama administration continues to tie the hands of employers. Consequently, employers have adjusted the sails to weather the storm. Why? Because the point is to survive and their survival benefits us all.\n\nOverbearing government will destroy the American dream \u2014 just Google current events in countries like Venezuela and Brazil. Hurting the employer hurts the current and potential employee. It\u2019s simple common sense. When will government officials learn this tug-of-war isn\u2019t working?\n\n___\n\nSal Nuzzo is Vice President of Policy for The James Madison Institute.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "Every week another job-killing, economy-stifling, Constitution-trampling regulation seems to come out from on high.
