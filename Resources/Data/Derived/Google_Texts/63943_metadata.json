They are both healthy, both accomplished.\n\nIn their earliest years, I was a sad and sickly mother. Going through two unexpected pregnancies was not going to benefit their own young lives. Ergo: two abortions followed: one legal, one not. Considering my fragile health, the doctors had advised me to proceed.\n\nEach abortion was a physical relief, and an emotional drain. Even though my abortions were, and most are, performed before a fetus is viable, the experience is nothing to be celebrated; instead, and I believe I speak for most women, the most \u2014 if not the only \u2014 positive emotion might be\u2026relief.\n\nRelief from difficult expenses; from interference with one\u2019s life path; from the emotional toll of additional children to care for; from \u2014 as noted \u2014 a negative impact on one\u2019s health; from fear; from feelings of inadequacy; from embarrassment; and so on. And, experience has shown us: too often, an unwanted child can be a highly unlucky one as well.\n\nIn deciding on abortion, I cannot recall seeking the opinion of others, except for my doctors. I do not recall sharing the decision or experience with others, save my husband and select intimates. Understanding the rationale for my decision, none tried to dissuade me.\n\nWhile much of life is left to luck, my adult children today lead reasonably balanced, successful lives. I prefer to believe that providing them a stable, attentive mother has helped.\n\nAmazingly, the abortion beat still goes on. In the courts, in Congress (for instance, the Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal programs from paying for abortions, and attacks on the Affordable Care Act), among the Republican Presidential candidates (all are anti-choice), in attacks on Planned Parenthood, in churches, synagogues, and on the other side, in the rise of several women\u2019s organizations telling their stories, demanding their right to manage their own lives, their own health, their own options.\n\nSee-sawing on abortion has become business as usual, from Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy to \u2014 heaven help us \u2014 Donald Trump. May I advise them to stop; please. Gents, bow out \u2014 it ain\u2019t nobody\u2019s business but our own.\n\nLaura Walcher is principal public relations counsel to J.
