That said, the meaning of Heritage Action scores seems to be more nebulous than some may have thought during the shutdown. During a break between speakers at Heritage Action\u2019s Conservative Policy Summit on Monday, the group\u2019s CEO, Michael Needham, said even some good conservative lawmakers don\u2019t get 100% scores.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s an expectation that every member of Congress can go home to his district and explain his voting record,\u201d Needham said.\n\n\u201cA Scott Brown going home to Massachusetts or potentially New Hampshire will have a different job in explaining his voting record than somebody from Texas or Kentucky,\u201d Needham continued. \u201cBut they should be able to have that conversation with their constituents.\u201d\n\nEven some of the speakers at the summit had unimpressive Heritage Action scores. The average score of speakers (from both houses of Congress) at the summit was 89.5%. And the average score of House conservatives who spoke \u2014 which you\u2019d think would be higher, given the hard rightward tack of some members of the conference \u2014 was lower, clocking in at 86%. Representative Phil Roe of Tennessee had the lowest score in the bunch, with a 66% rating.\n\nSenators Ted Cruz and Mike Lee had the highest, both with 100% marks.\n\nDan Holler, the group\u2019s communications director, reiterated to National Review that it\u2019s not necessarily the end-all-be-all indicator of whether or not members of Congress deserve conservatives\u2019 support.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t view members of Congress as a number,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cBecause we\u2019re not engaged in the electoral side, it\u2019s truly between a constituent and their member to decide what a Heritage Action score means,\u201d he adds.\n\nConstituents might not know that. And that irks many Congressional Republicans.\n\nOne aide who spoke to NRO anonymously (no Hill aides spoke on the record to NRO for this story) explained his frustration this way:\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re celebrating all these names,\u201d he said, referring to the Congressmen who spoke at the summit, \u201cand yet, if any of these people were to draw a primary challenger, you better believe those challengers are going to use the Heritage Action scorecard to argue that they\u2019re not that conservative.\u201d\n\nAnother aide puts it this way: \u201cThey claim to have the Reagan mantle, but Reagan\u2019s thing was, If you agree with me 70% of the time, you\u2019re a friend.\u201d\n\nThat aide adds that the scorecard rewards members of Congress for following rigid voting strictures, but not for making substantive change.\n\n\u201cPaul Broun will head into the home stretch of the Georgia Senate race with a great Heritage Action score and little else,\u201d the aide says.\n\nRepresentative Broun\u2019s score is 95%. So as promised, here members of Congress with Heritage Action scores that may seem unimpressive:\n\n1. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who delivered the GOP\u2019s response to the State of the Union address and who Think Progress says is a Birther, has a 48%.\n\n2. Senator Lisa Murkowski, who\u2019s drawn much ire from Mother Jones, has a 36%, putting her below at least three Democrats.\n\n3.
