It is a snowy Sunday in Colorado, with Denver getting a 1 to 3 inch dusting and up to a foot falling in the mountains.

The National Weather Service has placed much of the northeastern Plains under a winter storm warning and strong winds are expected to combine with snow to reduce visibility.

The snow is falling in the high country, where up to a foot is expected. “That will all go away tonight, then we have a seasonal week, with highs in the 40s,” Chad Gimmestad, a meteorologist with the NWS in Boulder, said Sunday morning.

Roads are slick and snow packed from Georgetown “all the way up to Vail Pass. Closer to home it is still pretty good,” said Mike Murray, Colorado Department of Transportation spokesman.

Three to 6 inches is expected in the foothills.

The snow is welcome news to snow-hungry ski resorts.

“The snowpack in the northern mountains has fallen a bit due to the previous dry and mild week,” the National Weather Service says. “As of December 8th, the South Platte River Basin snowpack is at 9 percent of normal. The southern mountains of Colorado, including the San Juans are still running quite below normal, around 60 percent of normal.”
