So it begins with your first prenatal visit and goes through to your six-week postpartum visit,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cIt is based on the midwifery model of care, although that can also include other providers such as obstetricians and family physicians.\u201d\n\nBirth centers offer a holistic approach and are not for women with complicated pregnancies, according to Bauer.\n\n\u201cIn a birth center you will not find epidurals or C-section capability,\u201d Bauer said.\n\nShe explained there are alternative methods for pain relief, such as movement, nitrous oxide or laughing gas and hydrotherapy, or the use of water.\n\nA typical family stay in a birth center is four to five hours after birth, according to Bauer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because the birth centers say you have to go home now, it\u2019s because they\u2019re ready to go home,\u201d she said. There is still close follow up even though the stay is shorter than a hospital, Bauer added. \u201cThey have follow up visits with the birth center staff, many times there is a home visit and phone calls.\u201d\n\nThe rise in popularity of birth centers isn\u2019t a surprise to Dr. Clara Surowitz, MD, co-owner of the planned facility in Lakewood.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s really up and coming now because all the statistics are showing that birth centers are really very safe, and the more people are delivering in hospitals, the more the interventions go up, and that\u2019s when you start seeing elevated C-section rates and other complications and things,\u201d said Dr. Surowitz.\n\nShe added there\u2019s no reason for a healthy woman carrying a healthy baby to go to a hospital.\n\nFree-standing birth centers are usually independent practices, according to Bauer, and are owned many times by the providers or they are community non-profit centers. Birth centers also can be owned by hospitals, and all of them do have a hospital affiliate with transfer agreements in the event complications arise, such as an expectant mother needs to have her labor stimulated or needs a higher level of pain management.\n\n\u201cReal dire emergencies only happen about less than half of 1 percent of the time, which is really very low, because when you take out all of those high-risk people or even people with some risk, then you\u2019re left with a group of people that would have a very low risk of anything happening,\u201d Surowitz said.\n\nShe said most of the hospital transfers are for people who don\u2019t progress or need Pitocin to augment their labor or those who want an epidural for the pain.\n\n\u201cThose are the vast majority of transfers, and then you have that very tiny percentage that are actually big emergencies,\u201d she said.\n\nMany insurances will cover birth center deliveries, and Surowitz said it\u2019s a big part of Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s two parts for getting paid for a birth: there\u2019s a facility fee and there\u2019s the provider fee. So, for a physician-owned birth center like mine, then the insurance will cover it, and it is mandated by Obamacare that the insurance companies cover birth center births,\u201d she said.\n\nMany birth Centers give free no-obligation orientations and Bauer said it\u2019s a great way to learn about the programs and services offered.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/nj1015.com/files/2015/10/RS7431_151907632.jpg", "sailthru.author": "diannedeoliveira", "description": "Birth centers are on the rise nationwide for women with low-risk pregnancies seeking natural delivery, and two are slated to open in New Jersey next year in Ocean and Morris Counties, according to officials with the American Association of Birth Centers.", "og": {"site_name": "New Jersey 101.5", "description": "Birth centers are on the rise nationwide for women with low-risk pregnancies seeking natural delivery, and two are slated to open in New Jersey next year in Ocean and Morris Counties, according to officials with the American Association of Birth Centers.", "title": "Why birth centers are gaining popularity in NJ", "url": "http://nj1015.com/why-birth-centers-are-gaining-popularity-in-nj/", "image": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/nj1015.com/files/2015/10/RS7431_151907632.jpg?w=600&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"site": "@nj1015", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-27 00:21:25", "sailthru.title": "Why birth centers are gaining popularity in NJ", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-wkxw, tsmmarket-trenton, tsmtype-local, birth-centers, newsletter, health, new-jersey-news, anycategorynews", "fb": {"admins": 100002025987268, "app_id": 309166499099898}, "keywords": "birth centers", "sailthru.description": "Birth centers are on the rise nationwide for women with low-risk pregnancies seeking natural delivery, and two are slated to open in New Jersey next year in Ocean and Morris Counties, according to officials with the American Association of Birth Centers.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/nj1015.com/files/2015/10/RS7431_151907632.jpg", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc53c\"", "article_summary": "So, for a physician-owned birth center like mine, then the insurance will cover it, and it is mandated by Obamacare that the insurance companies cover birth center births,\u201d she said.\nA typical family stay in a birth center is four to five hours after birth, according to Bauer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because the birth centers say you have to go home now, it\u2019s because they\u2019re ready to go home,\u201d she said.\nBirth centers are on the rise nationwide for women with low-risk pregnancies seeking natural delivery, and two are slated to open in New Jersey next year in Ocean and Morris Counties, according to officials with the American Association of Birth Centers.\n\u201cThere\u2019s two parts for getting paid for a birth: there\u2019s a facility fee and there\u2019s the provider fee."}
