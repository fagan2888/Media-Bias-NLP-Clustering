Gov. John Hickenlooper said he would consider accepting a cabinet post if offered one after the 2016 presidential election.

Hickenlooper, a Democrat whose second term ends in January 2019, spoke with 9News’ “Balance of Power” on Friday.

Host Brandon Rittiman asked the governor y about serving as secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior considering Hickenlooper once was a geologist.

“I would consider it,” the governor said.

“I’d have to evaluate and really be convinced that I could make a dramatic difference for the future of the country and do such a better job than the governor of New Mexico or the governor of — its usually a Western state — the governor of Washington.”

Hickenlooper mentioned family concerns as a reason he might pass on the job. He has a son who is about to turn 13.

Some analysts have also pegged Hickenlooper as a possible nominee for vice president, though he said in the interview that is “pretty far-fetched.”

The cabinet job, on the other hand, might not be as unlikely.

The first Interior secretary in President Obama’s administration was Ken Salazar, who served as Colorado attorney general before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2004. He resigned from the Senate in 2009 to take the cabinet post.

And the first woman to hold the position, Gale Norton, who served under President George W. Bush, was another former Colorado attorney general.

But the connections go back much further. Colorado’s first U.S. senator, Henry M. Teller, served as Interior secretary under President Chester A. Arthur from 1882 to 1885.

The current Interior Secretary, Sally Jewell, was the president and CEO of Recreation Equipment Inc., the outdoor gear retailer based in Washington.
