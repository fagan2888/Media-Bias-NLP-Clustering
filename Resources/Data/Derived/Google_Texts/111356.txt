Martha Stewart’s indelible list of lifestyle musts, also known as “good things,” can now be expanded to include drones. When Stewart isn’t busy engaging with Redditors about dildos or carefully curating her Match.com profile, the home goddess-turned-tech wiz is surveying her “gardens and livestock” from the comfort of her iPad, thanks to her personal drone.

At a Hermés event in New York this past week, Stewart shared with Vanity Fair her penchant for UAVs:

“It has a little camera. You connect it to your iPhone, and you can control it with your iPhone, and it flies all over my farm and takes pictures. It takes wonderful aerial photographs … I keep it up pretty high. And you can control the altitude, you can control the speed, you can control where it’s going. It’s easy to use, actually. You can really control it, it’s gentle. It’s lightweight, too; it’s very beautiful.”
