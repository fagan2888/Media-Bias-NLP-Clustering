Under the law, people age 65 and over, who are on Medicare, do not need to buy supplemental coverage. Nonetheless, some marketers are pushing expensive add-on policies by falsely claiming that such coverage is required, state authorities say. Others are telling people that the law means they need new Medicare cards \u2014 not true. And still others are charging fees as high as $100 to \u201chelp\u201d people navigate the new insurance landscape.\n\nAnd then there are those who are creating websites that resemble state health care exchanges. Visitors to those websites, with addresses like NewHampshireHealthExchange.com, say they are inundated with pitches from private insurance agents unaffiliated with the government.\n\nAuthorities warn that in some cases the come-ons are merely a ruse to get people to divulge sensitive Medicare and banking information. The pitches usually come with a telephone call or knock at the door. Someone claiming to be a government official offers help or warns residents that their Medicare cards are about to expire. Then the hook is set.\n\nTo Ms. Mirzayans, 68, the caller sounded so official that she agreed to meet him the next day at her home in Sherman Oaks, Calif. He told her the law meant she would have to update her Medicare card. Ms. Mirzayans, a retired small-business owner, was grateful that the government was taking such interest in her insurance coverage.\n\nOver glasses of pomegranate juice last month, Ms. Mirzayans divulged to her visitor crucial Medicare, Social Security and personal information. Only after the man left without giving her a business card did she grow suspicious.\n\n\u201cI just feel so foolish and betrayed,\u201d said Ms. Mirzayans, who reported the incident to state authorities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nShe is hardly alone. Across the country, volunteers with Senior Medicare Patrol, a government program that works with older Americans to root out health care fraud, say they have been deluged with calls for assistance. The typical complaints are from retirees who said they had handed over bank account information to callers claiming to be from Medicare.\n\nAnne Gray, a project coordinator in California with the Senior Medicare Patrol, said, \u201cSuch calls have doubled in recent months.\u201d\n\nMs. Miller and Ms. Ethan, both of whom live in California, said they also received calls from people urging them to update their Medicare cards in light of the new law. Neither fell for the ploy.\n\nIn Kentucky, Elsie Burdon, 70, said she knew she had slipped up almost as soon as she hung up the phone. She had divulged her Medicare information and Social Security number. Ms. Burdon, of Jenkins, Ky., said the caller assured her that Medicare was changing, inquired about her diabetes and even asked about her shoe size.\n\n\u201cI thought it was odd,\u201d Ms. Burdon said, adding that she immediately contacted her bank and state authorities. Days later, she got a flood of other marketing calls. \u201cI can\u2019t even keep track,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst it was a Joe, then an Ashley and then at least six other people all claiming to be from the government.\u201d\n\nAnyone, young or old, can be targeted by the unscrupulous marketers. But older people \u2014 whether because of age, their tendency to be at home often or other factors \u2014 are particularly vulnerable. Medicare has also long been a magnet for swindlers, thanks to its sheer scale and complexity. The troubled rollout of the new health care law has amplified the problem.\n\n\u201cThe scammers are deploying traditional Medicare cons but wrapping them in the Affordable Health Care Act,\u201d said James Quiggle of Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, a Washington-based nonprofit.\n\nWith all the problems surrounding the federal websites, it can be even more difficult for consumers to navigate. In October, New Hampshire\u2019s insurance commissioner hit the operator of NewHampshireHealthExchange.com, an insurance provider in Arizona, with a cease-and-desist order.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nLisa Madigan, the Illinois attorney general, is investigating a website over concerns that it is a lead generator for insurance providers not registered to do business within the state, the people briefed said.\n\nNew York\u2019s Department of Financial Services is also investigating potential fraud.\n\nMr. Price, 75, who lives in Willis, Tex., concedes he is not technology-proficient. \u201cI don\u2019t do the Internet,\u201d he said. But he was surprised at how quickly a wrong turn on the web led to a barrage of marketing calls. While he and a friend were watching football one recent Sunday, the friend entered Mr. Price\u2019s name and phone number into a pop-up window that appeared when Mr. Price was perusing an official-looking government website. Roughly five minutes later, Mr. Price said, his cellphone rang.\n\nOn the line, Mr. Price said, was a man who offered to come by his house the next day. Mr. Price declined \u2014 but got three more calls later that week.\n\n\u201cI know the Internet is fast,\u201d Mr. Price said, \u201cbut this was something else.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20131109220330, "twitter": {"description": "State and federal authorities have reported a rising number of consumer complaints, ranging from deceptive sales practices to identity theft, linked to the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Con Men Prey on Confusion Over Health Care Act", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/business/con-men-prey-on-confusion-over-health-care-act.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002544105"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/business/con-men-prey-on-confusion-over-health-care-act.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002544105", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/business/con-men-prey-on-confusion-over-health-care-act.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business", "hdl_p": "Con Men Prey On Confusion Over Care Act", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Nov. 9, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "HealthCare.gov", "keywords": "Health Insurance and Managed Care,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Frauds and Swindling,Elderly,Identity Theft,Computers and the Internet,HealthCare.gov", "news_keywords": "Old age,HealthCare.gov", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Susanne Craig", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "byl": "By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and SUSANNE CRAIG", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "State and federal authorities have reported a rising number of consumer complaints, ranging from deceptive sales practices to identity theft, linked to the Affordable Care Act.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "State and federal authorities have reported a rising number of consumer complaints, ranging from deceptive sales practices to identity theft, linked to the Affordable Care Act.", "CG": "business", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Nov. 9, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/susanne_craig/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/index.html", "section": "Business Day", "modified": "2014-07-16", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "tag": "HealthCare.gov", "published": "2013-11-09", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E"}, "slug": "10scams", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140716174050, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/business/con-men-prey-on-confusion-over-health-care-act.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/10/business/SCAMS/SCAMS-videoSixteenByNine1050-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "State and federal authorities have reported a rising number of consumer complaints, ranging from deceptive sales practices to identity theft, linked to the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Con Men Prey on Confusion Over Health Care Act"}, "pdate": 20131109, "des": "Computers and the Internet", "articleid": 100000002544105, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Con Men Prey on Confusion Over Health Care Act", "PST": "News"}, "article_summary": "On the line, Mr. Price said, was a man who offered to come by his house the next day.\n\u201cI know the Internet is fast,\u201d Mr. Price said, \u201cbut this was something else.\u201d\nTo Ms. Mirzayans, 68, the caller sounded so official that she agreed to meet him the next day at her home in Sherman Oaks, Calif.\nRoughly five minutes later, Mr. Price said, his cellphone rang.\nMs. Mirzayans, a retired small-business owner, was grateful that the government was taking such interest in her insurance coverage."}
