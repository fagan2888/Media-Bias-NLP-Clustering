Moving off the Euro would have been awful, but at least held the prospect of returning to growth and full employment within a couple years (from a much lower base). By contrast, the bank Natixis recently estimated that, given very generous assumptions, it will take Spain (which is in similarly dire straits) 25 years to return to 2007-era employment. A nation can do a great deal of catch-up growth in that time.\n\nRealistically, I'd guess this means that Spain, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, etc., will never recover fully, and instead we're witnessing the birth of a crummy, tattered Franco-German empire with a permanently depressed periphery.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Mother Jones Magazine", "og": {"site_name": "Mother Jones", "description": "Unemployment is still north of 25%, and youth unemployment is nearly double that.", "title": "Second look: Greece may be recovering, but only barely", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/04/second-look-greece-may-be-recovering-only-barely", "image": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_greece_unemployment_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Second look: Greece may be recovering, but only barely", "url": "http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2014/04/second-look-greece-may-be-recovering-only-barely", "image": {"src": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_greece_unemployment_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.motherjones.com/files/blog_greece_unemployment_0.jpg"}, "creator": "kdrum", "site": "@MotherJones", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "13301307,670317733,1198876232,38509772,106892,2907757,306289,602422192,4101301,513450539"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "Economy,International", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/sites/all/assets/mstile-150x150.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda7ef\"", "article_summary": "Yesterday I linked to a Hugo Dixon column arguing that Greece is, improbably, starting to recover.\nRealistically, I'd guess this means that Spain, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, etc., will never recover fully, and instead we're witnessing the birth of a crummy, tattered Franco-German empire with a permanently depressed periphery.\nIndeed, I rather fear this could be the worst of all worlds.\nRyan Cooper points to Greece's stubbornly high unemployment rate and begs to differ:With unemployment still over 27 percent, I'd say let's hold off on talk of a recovery.\nA nation can do a great deal of catch-up growth in that time."}
