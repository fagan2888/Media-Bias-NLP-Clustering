I\u2019ve been independent. I\u2019ve represented this state like I think it wants to be represented. There\u2019s always a danger in grading yourself, but I would give myself a better grade than good.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an assessment that elicits disbelief from Republicans, who say part of the problem for Udall is that Colorado\u2019s other senator, Democrat Michael Bennet, outshines him.\n\nUdall attracted six GOP challengers in his current bid for a second term in the U.S. Senate before Congressman Cory Gardner parachuted into the race in February, driving out the top competitors who believed the charismatic rising star in the Republican Party offered the best shot of ending the Democrats\u2019 winning streak.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 biggest beef with Udall: What exactly has the Boulder County Democrat accomplished during his nearly 16 years in Washington, D.C.?\n\n\u201cNo one I knew could tell you a thing he\u2019s done,\u201d said state Rep. Amy Stephens, a Monument Republican who dropped out of the race to make way for Gardner.\n\nShe has dubbed Udall \u201cMark Uterus\u201d because of his relentless attacks against Gardner on women\u2019s health issues.\n\nBut Udall has plenty of fans, among them Heidi Johnson, a project manager from Estes Park who approached Udall after a campaign event there.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just not a political person,\u201d she told him, \u201cbut I\u2019ve been proud to say I voted for you. I truly believe you try to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nRelated: Republican Cory Gardner defends conservative record in Senate bid\n\nFans say that\u2019s Udall\u2019s mode of operation.\n\nHe is passionate about energy, natural resources and national security. His belief in Americans\u2019 right to privacy resulted in his vote against the Patriot Act and his public battle with the National Security Agency over spying on U.S. citizens.\n\nHe upset gun-control advocates in 2009 when he supported an amendment by South Dakota Sen. John Thune, a Republican, that would have made it legal for gun owners licensed to carry concealed weapons to take them across state lines.\n\n\u201cIf you talk to anybody in the Senate, I\u2019m seen as a centrist, a problem solver. I\u2019m seen as somebody who works with members of the other party,\u201d Udall said. \u201cWhen you compare Congressman Gardner and me on that kind of scale, there\u2019s a real difference.\u201d\n\nA close one\n\nThe race is a close one, with most polls showing the candidates in a ferocious battle that could determine which party controls the Senate.\n\nThat the contest is so tight surprises some Democrats, despite President Barack Obama\u2019s unpopularity, because they believe Gardner is an ultra-conservative out of touch with most Coloradans.\n\nUdall has called out Gardner in campaign ads where the senator looks straight into the camera, a stern expression on his face.\n\n\u201cMark Udall looks so mean in his commercials, you think he\u2019s the Republican in the race,\u201d said former GOP state lawmaker Josh Penry.\n\nBut on the campaign trail, it\u2019s a different story. At the Off the Beaten Bath bookstore in Steamboat Springs, Democratic Rep. Diane Mitsch Bush bubbled with enthusiasm as she introduced the upbeat Udall.\n\n\u201d He is the head rugged collaborator-in-chief. Why? Because in an atmosphere in D.C. that is nasty and extreme and partisan, he is the voice of reason,\u201d she said. \u201cHe brings people together to get things done, and boy, has he gotten things done for us.\u201d\n\nWhat has Udall done?\n\nHe helped lead the effort to repeal the military\u2019s discriminatory \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d policy for gays, saying, \u201cIn the end, if we want the best and strongest military in the world, we have to make sure that all Americans can serve.\u201d\n\nHe worked with Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, a Republican, to push the Obama administration to stop \u201cfire borrowing,\u201d the practice of using fire-prevention funds to fight current fires.\n\nUdall and Sen. Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, sponsored legislation that closed a loophole that allowed millionaires to collect millions in unemployment benefits.\n\n\u201cWhen West Slope veterans were forced to travel hundreds of miles to Denver for basic surgeries, I intervened and championed a deal that cut through red tape to allow them to get essential surgeries here in Grand Junction,\u201d Udall said in his first Senate debate with Gardner.\n\nComing Tuesday: The 2014 Denver Post Senate Debate with Gardner and Udall, check denverpost.com/election2014 for details.\n\nDeep roots in state\n\nInside Rocky Mountain National Park in August, Udall inspected a sign featuring before-and-after pictures of the damage caused by last year\u2019s historic flooding. Huge trucks repairing the Old Fall River Road rumbled by.\n\nUdall has deep roots in Colorado.\n\nHis maternal grandfather, Roe Emery, is billed as the father of Colorado tourism and was the park\u2019s first concessionaire, bringing loads of visitors to view the stunning mountain vistas. Emery\u2019s three children, including daughter Patricia, spent their summers at the Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, which he co-owned.\n\nUdall\u2019s great-grandfather, L.G. Carpenter, was Colorado\u2019s water engineer in 1903-04 and played a role in the landmark Kansas vs. Colorado water case. Family folklore says Carpenter, an agricultural professor at what is now Colorado State University, at one point was encouraged to apply for the president\u2019s post.\n\n\u201cHe evidently said, \u2018That\u2019s too much politics. I don\u2019t want that job,\u2019 \u201d Udall said, laughing.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the case on Udall\u2019s father\u2019s side.\n\nAfter World War II, 6-foot-5 Morris \u201cMo\u201d Udall came to Colorado from Arizona to play for the Denver Nuggets. He hailed from a Mormon pioneer family with a long history of public service.\n\nMo met and married Patricia Emery, and they settled in Tucson, where Mark Emery Udall was born in 1950, Randy in 1951, Dodie in 1952, Anne in 1954, Brad in 1957 and Kate in 1960. Growing up, they heard stories about hard times in the old days for pioneer families in the West. Among those storytellers was family friend Barry Goldwater, the Arizona senator and template by which conservatives modeled themselves.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much water. The federal government didn\u2019t care about the Arizona territory,\u201d Udall said. \u201cSo you had to work together to get anything done.\u201d\n\nMo\u2019s brother, Stewart, was tapped by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 to serve as secretary of the Department of the Interior. Mo took over his brother\u2019s seat in the U.S. House, where he served for 30 years and left a legacy of pushing landmark legislation protecting the environment .\n\nMark Udall spent part of his childhood in a very different Washington, D.C., where Republicans and Democrats carpooled to the Capitol and went to each other\u2019s picnics. Mo, known as the liberal conscience of Congress, considered Goldwater his mentor. Years later, Arizona Sen. John McCain, the GOP nominee for president in 2008, would consider Mo his mentor.\n\nAfter his parents\u2019 divorce in 1965, Udall and his siblings spent their school years in Tucson. In 1968, Udall graduated from Canyon del Oro High School, where he was student-body president his senior year. Udall graduated from Williams College in 1972 with a degree in American civilization.\n\nHe briefly worked on his father\u2019s failed 1976 presidential campaign, then moved to Crested Butte and lived with his brother Randy and sister Dodie. Randy, a longtime advocate for renewable energy, died on a solo backpacking trip in Wyoming last year.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really dedicating this race in part to my brother,\u201d Udall said in April, after speaking to Denver Democrats at their county assembly.\n\nUdall has tackled all of Colorado\u2019s fourteeners, and climbed or attempted some of the world\u2019s most challenging peaks, including an effort to scale Mount Everest.\n\nIt was in Crested Butte that he met his future wife, Maggie Fox, who recently stepped down from her role as the CEO of former Vice President Al Gore\u2019s Climate Reality Project.\n\nThe couple, who married in 1982, have two children: Tess, 24, who is working on the 2014 campaign, and Jed, 27, who pleaded guilty in June to burglary and trespassing after he was caught breaking into cars in January. Deputies discovered heroin \u201cdebris\u201d on a used syringe and on a spoon in his possession. In a statement at the time, Udall said: \u201cWe love our son and stand with him in his commitment to getting the treatment he needs.\u201d\n\nIn 1973, Mark Udall was arrested on drug charges.\n\nRecently unearthed arrest reports by the conservative blog Colorado Peak Politics show Udall had been caught with 3 ounces of marijuana and three tablets of amphetamines. Although charged with felonies, he was allowed to plead guilty to a misdemeanor. He spent a night in jail, paid a $300 fine and had his station wagon seized.\n\n\u201cI learned from it, and I\u2019ve tried to teach my kids to be smarter than I was 35 years ago,\u201d Udall said in 2008, when he talked about the arrest, although he did not reveal all the details.\n\nTime for a change\n\nAt the age of 45, Udall, who had overseen Outward Bound, decided it was time for a change. He followed in his father\u2019s size-13 footsteps and entered politics. In 1996, he narrowly won his state House race.\n\nTwo years later, Udall ran for an open seat in Congress.\n\nThen it was off to Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1999, Udall cast a vote he regrets, a bill that eliminated the so-called \u201cGlass-Steagall\u201d restrictions first enacted during the Great Depression meant to prevent commercial banks from getting involved in a riskier set of businesses.\n\nWith America\u2019s economy on an unprecedented roll, it received overwhelming approval in Congress, with only one member of the Colorado delegation, then-Rep. Joel Hefley of Colorado Springs, dissenting. Hefley, a Republican, cited the damage the savings-and-loan scandal did to Colorado.\n\nAfter 9/11, Congress passed the Patriot Act, which gave authorities sweeping powers, including indefinite detentions of immigrants and searches of phone and e-mail records without a court order.\n\nSens. Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, two liberals who had talked about running for president, voted for the measure. Udall did not, despite some advice from Democratic political consultant Steve Welchert of Denver.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I don\u2019t know how you vote \u201cno\u201d when they\u2019re voting \u201cyes,\u201d and then one day you run for the U.S. Senate in Colorado,\u2019 \u201d Welchert said. \u201cHe said, \u2018I don\u2019t care about the politics, it\u2019s bad public policy.\u2019 Mark turned out to be right.\u2019 \u201c\n\nUdall did run for the Senate, in 2004, in what might be the briefest contest in Colorado history. He blinked in a game of political chicken, dropping out less than 24 hours later to make way for Democratic Attorney General Ken Salazar.\n\nIn 2008, Udall ran for an open Senate seat held by retiring U.S. Sen. Wayne Allard. Although the national political mood favored Democrats and his opponent, former Congressman Bob Schaffer, came off as prickly, the polls were tied that summer. With gas $4 a gallon, Udall\u2019s emphasis on renewable energy seemed out of touch.\n\nEverything changed that September when the stock market crashed. Some charged that the 1999 legislation lifting bank restrictions combined with Congress\u2019 reluctance to crack down on questionable lending and investment practices in federally chartered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and bad company practices set the stage for a crisis that left the world economy reeling.\n\nUdall gained ground, but when they debated on TV\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Schaffer was relentless, barely letting Udall get in a word.\n\nAlan Salazar, who now works for Gov. John Hickenlooper and served as Udall\u2019s chief of staff for nine years in the U.S. House, said Udall has never been able to conduct himself in a personally aggressive manner.\n\n\u201cIn all the time I\u2019ve known Mark, he cannot bring himself to cross the line of rudeness with people, even with people who are obnoxious to him,\u201d Salazar said. \u201cThe kind of verbal combat that comes out in politics is not Mark\u2019s forte.\u201d\n\nMore than two years ago, Dick Wadhams, former chairman of the Colorado Republican Party, began recruiting Gardner to run for higher office. Wadhams, who ran Shaffer\u2019s campaign in 2008, believed Udall would be an easier target than Bennet, whose seat is up in 2016.\n\n\u201cSen. Bennet has plunged himself into the major issues being debated in the Senate,\u201d Wadhams said. \u201cBennet seems energized, he seems involved. I don\u2019t agree with practically anything he says, but he is not sitting on the sidelines. I just felt the energy and vitality that Cory Gardner brings as a candidate would be in stark contrast to Udall.\u201d\n\nIndependent political analyst Eric Sondermann disagreed with Udall\u2019s self assessment as a \u201ccentrist.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs politics in Washington have become more polarized, any image of Mark Udall as a bipartisan, walk-across-the-aisle guy has been significantly diminished,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people I talk to think of Michael Bennet much more in that regard than they do Mark Udall.\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk to the ski areas\u201d\n\nUdall scoffed at the suggestion he hasn\u2019t accomplished anything.\n\n\u201cNothing could be further from reality,\u201d he said. \u201cGo talk to the ski areas.\u201d\n\nUdall wrote the 2011 law to allow ski areas to expand their recreational offerings to include summer activities, such as mountain biking, disc golf and zip-lining. The Forest Service at the time estimated the bill would increase summer visits to national forests by 600,000 people annually, create 600 full- or part-time jobs and inject nearly $40 million into mountain communities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you can do,\u201d Udall spokesman Chris Harris said, \u201cwhen you\u2019re not trying to get on Fox News all the time.\u201d\n\nLynn Bartels: 303-954-5327, lbartels@denverpost.com or twitter.com/lynn_bartels", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Sen.
