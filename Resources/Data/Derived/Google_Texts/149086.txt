President Barack Obama took a shot at Fox News during a speech on the economy Thursday.

The president was saying the economy is stronger than before he took office, and so Republicans have less to complain about.

“There’s a reason fewer Republicans are preaching doom on the deficits – it’s because the deficits have come down at almost a record pace and they’re now manageable,” Obama said. “There’s a reason fewer Republicans, you hear them running around about Obamacare – because while good, affordable health care might seem like a fanged threat to the freedom of the American people on Fox News, it turns out it’s working pretty well in the real world.”

Obama spoke on the campus of Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.

“When push came to shove this year, and Republicans in Congress actually had to take a stand on policies that would help the middle class and working Americans – raising the minimum wage, enacting fair pay, refinancing student loans, extending insurance for the unemployed – the answer was ‘no,’” Obama said.

Fox News has been a repeat target for criticism by the Obama administration.
