Richardson Milling, a grain-milling plant, has 15 days from the receipt of the citations to comply, seek an information conference with OSHA\u2019s area director or contest the citations and penalties before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review, Rodriguez said.\n\n\u201cAllowing grain milling dust to accumulate near equipment that could start an explosion is a recipe for disaster,\u201d Elizabeth Linda Routh, OSHA\u2019s area director in Lubbock, said in a statement. \u201cRichardson Milling exposed its workers to preventable dangers.\u201d\n\nA woman who answered the phone at Richardson Milling in Dawn referred the Globe-News to a company spokeswoman, who did not immediately return a phone call Wednesday seeking comment on the investigation.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Local News", "og": {"site_name": "Amarillo Globe-News", "description": "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has proposed a $63,000 fine against a Dawn milling plant over 11 alleged serious violations at the facility. \nIn October, OSHA's Lubbock office inspected Richardson Milling Inc.", "title": "OSHA proposes fine against Dawn milling company", "url": "http://amarillo.com/news/local-news/2015-02-18/osha-proposes-fine-against-dawn-milling-company-over-alleged-violations", "image": "http://amarillo.com/sites/default/files/osha.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has proposed a $63,000 fine against a Dawn milling plant over 11 alleged serious violations at the facility.In October, OSHA\u2019s Lubbock office inspected Richardson Milling Inc. under a program for industries engaged in grain-handling activities."}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5d87\"", "article_summary": "\u201cRichardson Milling exposed its workers to preventable dangers.\u201dA woman who answered the phone at Richardson Milling in Dawn referred the Globe-News to a company spokeswoman, who did not immediately return a phone call Wednesday seeking comment on the investigation.\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration has proposed a $63,000 fine against a Dawn milling plant over 11 alleged serious violations at the facility.\nIn October, OSHA\u2019s Lubbock office inspected Richardson Milling Inc. under a program for industries engaged in grain-handling activities.\nJuan Rodriguez, an OSHA spokesman, said the citations were issued Tuesday.\n\u201cAllowing grain milling dust to accumulate near equipment that could start an explosion is a recipe for disaster,\u201d Elizabeth Linda Routh, OSHA\u2019s area director in Lubbock, said in a statement."}
