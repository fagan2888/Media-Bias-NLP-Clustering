( April Dembosky/KQED )\n\nAlong Market Street in San Francisco Thursday, down the block from the people handing out brochures about Jesus and a man protesting the local bank, a bunch of therapists set some chairs on the sidewalk.\n\n\u201cFree listening!\u201d therapist Traci Ruble called out to passersby. \u201cDo you wanna be listened to?\u201d\n\nMost people rushed by, either saying a quick \u201cNo thank you,\u201d flashing a bemused smile, or ignoring the offer altogether.\n\n\u201cI feel like a canvasser,\u201d Ruble said, admitting she felt a bit rejected.\n\nIt was a tough and unusual sell: asking people to take 15 minutes out of their lunch break to sit on the street and talk with a therapist. But Ruble and her collaborator, therapist Lily Sloane, say they have a noble objective.\n\n\u201cThe goal is really about de-stigmatizing mental health,\u201d Ruble says, adding that they also want to combat the technology culture that has people walking down the street with their eyes glued to their cellphones. She says she misses random urban interactions.\n\n\u201cI love seeing someone dancing in the street, or when an old lady calls me sweetheart,\u201d she says. \u201cI want everyone to feel like we belong. I feel like that has a huge impact on mental health itself.\u201d\n\nShe organized more than two dozen therapists \u2014 and a couple nuns from the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence \u2014 to station themselves at spots throughout San Francisco for a day of \u201cSidewalk Talks.\u201d\n\nBefore long, Ruble\u2019s calls outside the Embarcadero BART station \u2014 and bright yellow \u201cFree Listening\u201d fliers taped on the sidewalk \u2013managed to snag the first customer of the day, Tony Koo.\n\n\u201cI recently came out of the closet with my bi-polar disorder,\u201d he said.\n\nHe tells Ruble that when he was younger, he was taught to be ashamed of his condition, and to hide his medication. Sometimes he\u2019d stop taking it altogether.\n\n\u201cEvery time I wound up in the hospital,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhich isn\u2019t great for you,\u201d Ruble responded.\n\n\u201cWhich is not good for me at all,\u201d Koo said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a person with really high blood pressure not taking their blood pressure medicine,\u201d Ruble said. \u201cYou could die.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, exactly,\u201d Koo said. \u201cSo this idea of me accepting my condition has always been difficult and challenging, because of my own self-stigma, because of stigma I feel from others around me.\u201d\n\nKoo says the attitude around mental illness today is similar to the gay rights movement in the 1980s. He says more people need to go public with their depression or anxiety so it becomes more broadly accepted throughout the culture.\n\n\u201cWe have to have the courage to look people eye to eye,\u201d he said.\n\nRuble says she\u2019s gotten calls from several other cities in the country that want to replicate the idea of Sidewalk Talks. In San Francisco, they plan to repeat the event at least once a year.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Free listening,\" a therapist called out, along Market Street.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Therapists Target Mental Health Stigma With 'Sidewalk Talks'\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/05\\/08\\/therapists-target-mental-health-stigma-with-sidewalk-talks\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-05-08 10:07:14\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-06-02 16:49:10\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":25666,\"author_id\":\"3205\",\"author_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"author_display_name\":\"April Dembosky\",\"tags\":[\"Mental Health\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2015\\/05\\/IMG_0960-e1431104162756.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "\"Free listening,\" a therapist called out, along Market Street.", "title": "Therapists Target Mental Health Stigma With \u2018Sidewalk Talks\u2019", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/05/08/therapists-target-mental-health-stigma-with-sidewalk-talks/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2015/05/IMG_0985-400x300.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "mental health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c29\"", "article_summary": "In San Francisco, they plan to repeat the event at least once a year.\nTony Koo, right, talks with therapist Abby Thompson on Market Street in San Francisco.\nRuble says she\u2019s gotten calls from several other cities in the country that want to replicate the idea of Sidewalk Talks.\n( April Dembosky/KQED )Along Market Street in San Francisco Thursday, down the block from the people handing out brochures about Jesus and a man protesting the local bank, a bunch of therapists set some chairs on the sidewalk.\n\u201cFree listening!\u201d therapist Traci Ruble called out to passersby."}
