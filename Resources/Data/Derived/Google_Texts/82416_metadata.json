According to Bloomberg, demand for nurses may out pace this growth due to more coverage for healthcare through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as well as projected physician shortages and population growth and aging.\n\nSt. Luke's Health System, in Boise, ID, is addressing this potential nurse shortage head-on with its integration of a unique patient monitoring system, called eICU \u2014 electronic care unit, for its intensive care patients. eICU allows a team of doctors and nurses to monitor patient rooms remotely.\n\nThe electronic intensive care unit (eICU) is an application of remote telemedicine technology in which critical care nurses from within St. Luke\u2019s system monitor multiple intensive care units and assist in ICU management from a centralized control room.\n\nThe eICU model uses state-of-the-art technology to monitor critically ill patients providing the tools for the hospitals\u2019 ICU staff to intervene early in patient care while applying practices that are proven to improve patient outcomes.\n\nPhase one of the program implementation began in January 2013, monitoring all St. Luke\u2019s critical care beds in Boise and Meridian. Phase two began August 2013, when the eICU expanded to monitoring critical care beds in St. Luke\u2019s Magic Valley. Phase three, the final phase, is well underway with emergency services support added for its critical access hospital partners in Wood River, Jerome, McCall, and Mt. Home.\n\nThe final phase will conclude with the addition of critical care beds in West Valley Medical Center, Vibra Hospital of Boise, and Southwest Idaho Advanced Care Hospital as well as emergency support in Gooding and Grangeville.\n\nAs the only Idaho-based, not-for-profit health system, St. Luke\u2019s Health System is part of the communities it serves, with local physicians and boards who further its organization\u2019s mission to improve the health of people in its region.\n\nSt. Luke\u2019s, along with Meridian, was named the top hospital in Idaho by U.S. News & World Report. \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be recognized by U.S. News and to share the recognition with Kootenai Medical Center,\u201d said St. Luke\u2019s Health System President and CEO Dr. David C. Pate. \u201cNational rankings are a validation of St. Luke\u2019s continued efforts to improve the quality and safety of our care while delivering on our mission to improve the health of people in our region.\u201d\n\nSt. Luke\u2019s Health System consists of nine facilities including:\n\nSource: St. Luke\u2019s", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "<p>Implementation of eICU helps St. Luke&rsquo;s Health System shift to a proactive care model that addresses physician and nurse shortages while improving the quality of patient care. <em>By Karla Paris, contributing writer</em></p>", "creator": "Karla Paris", "image": {"src": "http://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/db79f2cd/db79f2cd-27de-4859-a006-5d1f2845d4e8/hto_5_hot_healthcare_technology_innovations.jpg"}, "title": "Remote Monitoring In The ICU", "site": "HITOutcomes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Implementation of eICU helps St. Luke&rsquo;s Health System shift to a proactive care model that addresses physician and nurse shortages while...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "Title": "Remote Monitoring In The ICU"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcff05\"", "article_summary": "Phase one of the program implementation began in January 2013, monitoring all St. Luke\u2019s critical care beds in Boise and Meridian.\nRemote Monitoring In The ICUBy Karla ParisImplementation of eICU helps St. Luke\u2019s Health System shift to a proactive care model that addresses physician and nurse shortages while improving the quality of patient care.\nPhase two began August 2013, when the eICU expanded to monitoring critical care beds in St. Luke\u2019s Magic Valley.\nAs the only Idaho-based, not-for-profit health system, St. Luke\u2019s Health System is part of the communities it serves, with local physicians and boards who further its organization\u2019s mission to improve the health of people in its region.\nThe electronic intensive care unit (eICU) is an application of remote telemedicine technology in which critical care nurses from within St. Luke\u2019s system monitor multiple intensive care units and assist in ICU management from a centralized control room."}
