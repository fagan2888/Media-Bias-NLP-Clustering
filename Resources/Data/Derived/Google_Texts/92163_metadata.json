The cities reported on are led by mayors who serve on the U.S. Conference of Mayors\u2019 Task Force on Hunger and Homelessness.\n\nA number of important findings emerged from the survey:\n\nEmergency food assistance requests rose by an average of 2.8 percent during the survey period in more than half, 61 percent, of the cities involved in the survey.\n\nTwenty-three percent of requests for emergency food assistance in the cities surveyed went unmet.\n\nFood pantries and emergency kitchens had to cut back on the amount of food given out as groceries or meals in 47 percent of cities involved in the survey. Additionally, in far more than half of cities surveyed, 57 percent, families and individuals had to cut down on the number of visits to charitable food outlets they could make each month. The same percentage of cities were unable to meet food requests by homeless and hungry residents demand because they lacked sufficient resources.\n\nLack of affordable housing, an issue that continues to worsen in many places around the country, was the primary reason given for homelessness among families with children. Poverty, unemployment and low-paying jobs were the reasons that followed.\n\nIn 50 percent of cities surveyed, mayors indicated they expected homelessness to rise \u201cmoderately\u201d next year. Similarly, 65 percent of cities say they expect emergency food requests to \u201cmoderately\u201d increase over the coming 12 months.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new U.S. Conference of Mayors report looks at 22 cities across the country.
