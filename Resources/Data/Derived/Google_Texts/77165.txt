In theory, hospital expansion should be an easy process: get the necessary permits, build new space and add some new beds. But things get complicated if the hospital is physician-owned, as evidenced by a recent CMS notice.

Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Rockwall, a 50-bed hospital located in Rockwall, Texas, is seeking an exception to an Affordable Care Act ban on the expansion of physician-owned hospitals, according to the notice. The ban was put in place to address concerns over potential Stark law violations.

Under the Stark law , most Medicare self-referrals are prohibited, including situations where physicians own or invest in a hospital.

Texas Health Rockwall says it meets the requirements of an applicable hospital, meaning it serves a higher percentage of Medicaid patients than any other hospital in its county, as well as operates in a state with a lower average bed capacity than the national average. Additionally, the hospital is located in a county that’s had a population increase of at least 150 percent of the overall state population increase.

Hospitals can qualify for two exceptions to the ban: either the whole hospital exception, which allows physician ownership of a hospital as long as it’s in the whole hospital and not an individual unit, or a rural hospital exception, which allows physician ownership if the hospital’s in a rural region. However, hospitals can’t qualify for either exception unless they’re deemed an applicable hospital or a high-Medicaid facility.

Comments on the request for an exception are due by March 2. So far, three physician-owned hospitals have received permission to expand since the ACA was enacted, including two in Texas.
