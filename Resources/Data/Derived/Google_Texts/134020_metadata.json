Interested florists just need to go to the website and fill out an application, including a picture of their original work.\n\nChosen designs will be featured on 1-800-Flowers.com with a photo, video and story about the florist and his or her store. Florists that use BloomNet\u2019s web portal will also get a link to their website on the 1-800-Flowers product page.\n\nThe local exclusive program is located on the \u201cSame Day Flowers\u201d section of 1-800-Flowers.com within the specific zip code of the local florist.\n\nThere are multiple categories available in the program, from floral arrangements and corsages to gift baskets and fruit bouquets. Products should be unique and ideally utilize local products and design elements.\n\nThe program will also feature company spotlights, social media marketing campaigns and contests.\n\n1-800-Flowers also recently announced that they will begin accepting Bitcoin as payment in the near future. They are currently in negotiations with Coinbase.\n\nGet Free Updates! Stay in the loop with a weekly newsletter, with all our news from the previous week.
