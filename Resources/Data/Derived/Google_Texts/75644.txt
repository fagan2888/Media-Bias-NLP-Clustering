During this week of National Women and Girls HIV/AIDS Awareness Day, we are reminded that thanks to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), most insurance plans are now required to cover many preventive services for women without charging a co-pay or other fees. This includes several services helpful in our national responses to HIV and viral hepatitis:

HIV screening and counseling for sexually active women,

Hepatitis B screening for pregnant women at their first prenatal visit,

Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) counseling for sexually active women, and

Domestic and interpersonal violence screening and counseling for all women

These are just four of the many important health screenings and preventive services now covered. Wondering what preventive services are covered? Check out HealthCare.gov’s list of preventive care services for women.

Not sure what screening tests you need? The HHS Office on Women’s Health offers a helpful list of recommended screening tests and vaccines for women. You can also use healthfinder.gov’s myhealthfinder easy online tool to find out what preventive services you—or a loved one—might need this year. For specific information on which HIV, viral hepatitis, STD, and TB preventive services are covered, check out CDC’s preventive services coverage tables.
