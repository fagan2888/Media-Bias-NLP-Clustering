The Meridian-Lauderdale County Public Library and the Junior Auxiliary have partnered for Reading Rocks.

The event was to encourage children to read. Free books were given to children who attended. The event featured a guest speaker and guest reader. The meridian high drum line was also there. A new addition to the library was introduced. The Krayon Kiosk allows children access to iPads for educational purposes that includes reading, writing, spelling, math, science and more.

"The junior auxiliary of Meridian provisional class has partnered with the Meridian public library to renovate their childrenâ€™s section. We raised money through a t-shirt fundraiser we also had a grant and a donation given by Liz Sprabery," organizer Mindy Aust says.

The event was free to the public.
