My mother was on top of my little sister, my dad was on top of my brother, and I was between them. And all I could hear her say was, 'my legs are broken, my legs are broken,'\" Kraus said.\n\nKraus says her family was lucky to survive. Her father was Udall's mayor at the time, and it was his resilience she said that inspired the community to keep going.\n\n\"The morning after the tornado, several people came up to my dad and said, 'Toots where are you going to go?' And he said, 'I'm staying right here. I'm going to rebuild. This is home,'\" Kraus said.\n\nKraus's dad has since passed away but she says his spirit lives on because of ceremonies like the one held Monday.\n\n\"I know my dad would be so proud,\" she said. \"His dream was to build Udall back to be bigger and better than ever.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Monday marks 60 years since a deadly tornado nearly wiped out a small Kansas town.", "language": "english", "author": "Madeline Anderson", "og": {"description": "Monday marks 60 years since a deadly tornado nearly wiped out a small Kansas town.", "title": "Memorial Day marks 60th anniversary of Kansas' deadliest tornado", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Today-marks-60th-anniversary-of-Kansas-deadliest-tornado--304951991.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/15F/199/15F19938B6274569A47F802D5C8C228C", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/137/2C1/1372C1CA7F464D5C9A6103CF57EA947F.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Monday marks 60 years since a deadly tornado nearly wiped out a small Kansas town.", "title": "Memorial Day marks 60th anniversary of Kansas' deadliest tornado", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Today-marks-60th-anniversary-of-Kansas-deadliest-tornado--304951991.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/tornado196.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Memorial Day marks 60th anniversary of Kansas' deadliest tornado", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Memorial Day marks 60th anniversary"}, "article_summary": "Monday marks 60 years since a deadly tornado nearly wiped out a small Kansas town.\nI'm going to rebuild.\n\"The morning after the tornado, several people came up to my dad and said, 'Toots where are you going to go?'\nAnd all I could hear her say was, 'my legs are broken, my legs are broken,'\" Kraus said.\nKraus's dad has since passed away but she says his spirit lives on because of ceremonies like the one held Monday."}
