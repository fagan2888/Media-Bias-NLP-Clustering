Next Wednesday will mark the one-year anniversary of the first Ebola diagnosis on U.S. soil. Thomas Eric Duncan contracted the disease in his native Liberia before traveling to Dallas and falling ill here. He died at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital on Oct. 8, 2014.

As Duncan battled Ebola, Olivia Hallisey, then 16, was working on a way to slow the spread of the disease. Earlier this week, Hallisey walked away with the grand prize at the Google Science Fair in Mountain View, Calif., for her invention: a rapid, portable Ebola test that can be used in the field because it requires no refrigeration or electricity. It’s designed to detect Ebola in its earliest stages.

“The best way to limit Ebola’s spread is if you can isolate someone before they’re contagious,” said Hallisey, a high school junior from Greenwich, Conn., who became concerned about the Ebola outbreak in West Africa after reading about it in the news.

I spoke to her while covering the fair for Scientific American magazine, which co-sponsors the awards. Here’s more on Hallisey and her project.
