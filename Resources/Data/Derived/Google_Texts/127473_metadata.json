However, that tax doesn\u2019t apply until the earnings are brought back to the U.S. \u2014 \u201crepatriated\u201d in tax talk. Many companies hoard millions and even billions of dollars in \u201cdeferred\u201d earnings overseas purely to avoid U.S. taxation.\n\nSome corporations go even further to minimize their tax payments. Rather than eventually paying on those deferred earnings, they arrange a merger with a foreign firm that allows them to retain foreign earnings without paying U.S. taxes. Notable inversions of recent years include those by drug maker Actavis and offshore drilling firm Transocean. Pending deals include Burger King and medical device giant Medtronic.\n\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s slew of new rules announced Monday are designed to limit the ability of U.S. companies to avoid taxation on deferred earnings by explicitly barring businesses from using some of the most common tools that facilitate the practice. So-called \u201chopscotch\u201d loans \u2014 in which an inverted firm transfers deferred earnings to a newly minted foreign parent company \u2014 are blocked, as are a number of similar practices meant to turn previously taxable income into pure profit.\n\nRelated: Dems Seek an Election Edge on Corporate Tax Inversions\n\nDealing with companies that invert in order to avoid the tax on repatriated income was the easy part, says Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center in Washington. Rosenthal said he was pleased to see Treasury take some steps against abuse of the corporate inversion process, but pointed out that the new rules \u201cdid not tackle the full range of benefits U.S. companies get from a corporate inversion.\u201d\n\nThe Treasury Department\u2019s announcements failed to address a practice called \u201cearnings stripping\u201d \u2014 a different tax-avoidance practice by which U.S. firms are purchased by overseas companies which then \u201cloan\u201d them large amounts of money. Typically, the loans serve no practical purpose except to create a debt obligation for the U.S. firm, which allows it to deduct its interest payment from its taxable earnings.\n\nRelated: Obama Wasn\u2019t Always So Tough on Corporate Tax Inversions\n\nThe effect is that money earned in the U.S., which would otherwise be taxable, is shipped overseas as interest payment on debts. U.S. affiliates of the foreign firms are thus able to subtract the payments from their taxable income \u2014 even, in theory, \u201czeroing out\u201d U.S. tax liability.\n\nTreasury on Monday asked for comments from the public on further efforts it might undertake to make corporate inversions less attractive, and earnings stripping was plainly on the agency\u2019s radar screen.\n\nHowever, Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY), one of the most influential voices in Congress on the question, argued that the next steps are up to lawmakers. \u201cThe administration has made a good effort, but administrative action can only go so far,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that without legislation that stops earning stripping\u2026this egregious abuse is likely to continue.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "U.S. companies that dodge taxes through \u201ccorporate inversions\u201d suffered a blow Monday when the Treasury Department announced new rules to make the practice less attractive.
