CHICAGO (AP) - The Illinois Supreme Court has amended its rules of professional conduct to allow attorneys to advise medical marijuana businesses.

The court announced its revisions earlier this week. The change addresses the conflict between state and federal law on marijuana: Illinois allows marijuana for medical purposes; the federal government prohibits it.

The new ethics rules allow lawyers to advise their clients on state law as long as they also advise them about related federal law and policy.

The newly formed Illinois Cannabis Bar Association is applauding the change. Founding member William Bogot says attorneys “no longer have to worry about compromising their ethical obligations” when they help medical marijuana businesses.

The Illinois Cannabis Bar Association has about 40 founding members. They include former regulators, private practitioners and entrepreneurs.
