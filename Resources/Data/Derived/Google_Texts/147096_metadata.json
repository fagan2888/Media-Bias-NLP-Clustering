Diane Black (R-TN), a former nurse for more than 40 years, is on a mission to make sure senior citizens pay a fair, reasonable cost for their healthcare plans.\n\nAs co-author of the Securing Care for Seniors Act of 2015 (H.R. 2579), Black wants the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to reevaluate and, if necessary, make changes to its Medicare Advantage (MA) program, which she said has suffered cuts and changes imposed by Obamacare.\n\nSpecifically, the proposed bill aims to guarantee that the MA risk adjustment model metrics \u2013 which are used to calculate the risk score that insurance companies use to set payment levels \u2014 are accurate, evidence-based, and transparent. This will ensure seniors pay fairer costs for healthcare and that the MA program remains sustainable in the long term, said Black.\n\nSeniors should be \u201cin charge of their healthcare decisions, not \u2018Doctor Obama,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nOn June 2, the bipartisan proposal unanimously passed the House Ways and Means Committee and now is up for consideration by the full House, possibly during the week of June 22. Black told the Ripon Advance that she and lead cosponsor Rep. Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) are working to secure strong bipartisan support for H.R. 2579 when it does reach the House floor.\n\nWhat\u2019s significant about the bill, she said, is that it \u201ccalls a time-out on CMS\u2019s changes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s healthcare law drastically slashed MA payments,\u201d Black said. \u201cMore recently, the [CMS] enacted secretive changes to the program\u2019s risk adjustment model \u2013 its system for paying out benefits based on an enrollee\u2019s predicted health costs \u2013 that could leave America\u2019s most vulnerable citizens at risk by discouraging plans to detect and care for chronic conditions in their early stages.\u201d\n\nShe also said that such changes were made with \u201clittle to no input from Congress and, most importantly, Medicare Advantage beneficiaries.\u201d The Obama administration, she added, seems intent on upending a program that so many seniors depend on to stay well.\n\nIn fact, in Black\u2019s home state of Tennessee, one-third of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.\n\n\u201cMy constituents consistently tell me \u2026 that they enjoy the flexibility and choice of MA and they don\u2019t want to see a board of faceless bureaucrats at CMS reconfigure the program\u2019s risk adjustment model in a way that could price them out of a healthcare plan that works for them,\u201d she said.\n\nBlack is also working in other ways to offer relief from Obamacare.\n\nFor example, also on June 2 the House Ways and Means Committee passed the Preservation of Access for Seniors in Medicare Advantage Act of 2015 (H.R. 2581), which includes language from Black\u2019s VBID for Better Care Act of 2015 (H.R. 2570). She said H.R. 2581 will help MA plans improve delivery of care by allowing them to decrease costs for certain high-value services and treatments, especially for low-income patients.\n\n\u201cI understand the need for healthcare reform, but Obamacare was never the way to do it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were reminded of this just last week when the administration released insurers\u2019 requested rates for 2016 and we learned that health plans across the country are asking approval for double-digit premium increases.\n\n\u201cThis is a big warning sign for the future of Obamacare,\u201d she said.\n\nThe best solution to \u201cthis Obamacare rate shock,\u201d Black said, is for Congress to start over on health reform.\n\n\u201cBut until that can be achieved, we\u2019ll keep working to provide relief from some of the most onerous provisions of Obamacare,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Ripon Advance", "description": "U.S. Rep.
