The anticipated savings come as Iraq\u2019s government faces an increased budget crunch due to falling oil prices, which have plunged from more than $100 a few months ago to about $70 now. Iraq\u2019s minister of finance said earlier this week that a quarter of the Iraqi budget for 2015 will be allocated to cover military and security needs.\n\nRelated: Iraq Says Failing Oil Prices Force Rethink of 2015 Budget\n\nLast week, the governor of the Central Bank of Iraq said that authorities had managed to stop a theft of 240 billion Iraqi Dinars (about $200 million) from public banks. Iraq\u2019s deputy prime minister said on Friday that Iraq will save about 120 billion Iraqi Dinars (or $100 million) by eliminating those \u201cghost soldiers\u201d from the army payroll.\n\n\u201cBy comparing our records, I was able this month to eliminate 50,000 from the number of aliens (ghost soldiers) in one batch, equal to four divisions,\u201d al-Abadi said on Sunday while addressing the parliament in a televised session. The Iraqi army is composed of 14 divisions, and the large number of \u201cghost soldiers\u201d may help explain why four of them, and a federal police division, collapsed in the face of an offensive by ISIS during the summer.\n\n\u201cI am saddened that we were paying all these salaries all that time when we don\u2019t have funding,\u201d al-Abadi said. \u201cSoldiers are being killed. They are fighting and are being killed. But there are people who are paid while they don\u2019t exist. It was allowed for all of that to happen all that time while it needed only some record auditing to discover it. I expect to find other wonders If we conduct a field inspection.\u201d\n\nIn his speech, the prime minister laid out a general road map for his anti-corruption plan. \u201cMy concern is to stop the waste,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have two phases. Stopping the waste now since we need money and we don\u2019t have money. The second phase is to make those responsible for it accountable. I will assign that to the agencies and there will be a follow up.\u201d\n\nRelated: 50,000 Iraqi \u2018Ghost Soldiers\u2019 Make $380 Million a Year\n\nConfronting Iraq\u2019s history of corruption, both inside and outside the military, will not be easy, but the Iraqi government also faces pressure from the U.S. to deal with such issues and fortify its military. The U.S. has spent more than $20 billion on training and equipping the Iraqi military over the past decade, and the Pentagon is now asking for another $1.2 billion for additional training and equipment next year.\n\n\u201cThis is a major task,\u201d al-Abadi said on Sunday. \u201cWe will not let them go free. Frankly, I will spare no one. Everyone who is responsible for waste will be accountable. The most dangerous corruption is within the security establishment. And also the most dangerous corruption is within the political establishment.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the prime minister fired 24 generals from the Ministry of Interior. The ministry\u2019s director general in charge of payrolls was detained. The senior deputy minister, an ally of the former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, was replaced last month. This happened a few weeks only after another house cleaning in which 26 army generals were fired or transferred.\n\nThe anti-corruption campaign is the largest such push in Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The troubling and embarrassing disclosure this week that Iraq has been paying salaries", "title": "Iraq\u2019s Two-headed War: ISIS and Corruption", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/03/Iraq-s-Two-headed-War-ISIS-and-Corruption", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-iraq-usa_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/12/03/Iraq-s-Two-headed-War-ISIS-and-Corruption", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-iraq-usa_1.jpg", "creator": "@AlhamdaniRiyadh", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The troubling and embarrassing disclosure this week that Iraq has been paying salaries", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d33\"", "article_summary": "And also the most dangerous corruption is within the political establishment.\u201dOn Monday, the prime minister fired 24 generals from the Ministry of Interior.\nThe results of those efforts, just from the last few days, will recover or save about $300 million, Iraqi officials said.\nThe senior deputy minister, an ally of the former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, was replaced last month.\nIraq\u2019s minister of finance said earlier this week that a quarter of the Iraqi budget for 2015 will be allocated to cover military and security needs.\nIraq\u2019s deputy prime minister said on Friday that Iraq will save about 120 billion Iraqi Dinars (or $100 million) by eliminating those \u201cghost soldiers\u201d from the army payroll."}
