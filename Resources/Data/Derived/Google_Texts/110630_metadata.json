Somehow, after six years of conservative agitation against the mandate and a 5-4 Supreme Court majority finding it unconstitutional as an exercise of Congress\u2019s commerce (but not taxi!) power, it seems likely we\u2019re going to end up with two consecutive Republican presidential nominees who are pro-mandate. Romney at least wanted to leave the mandate-making to the states; Trump, an authoritarian with no apparent philosophical interest in federalism, probably won\u2019t be as deferential. The silver lining, though, in nominating Trump as his affronts to conservative orthodoxy pile up (\u201cBush lied!\u201d) is that we\u2019ll get to finally see in the general election just what sort of real electoral muscle the conservative movement has. In theory, if the GOP electorate is as conservative as people claim, Trump saying something like this should detonate his potential support among a solid third of the party. No major-party nominee can win a general election after bleeding that much support on his own side. In practice, I\u2019d be very, very surprised if the numbers of Republicans staying home in a Trump/Hillary race greatly exceeded the numbers who stayed home for Romney or McCain. It\u2019d be a different group that failed to show this year than failed to show in previous cycles, but in terms of raw numbers? Partisan tribalism will deliver most Republicans to Trump no matter how many supposed \u201ccore\u201d beliefs he tramples on. That\u2019s why, whatever Trump\u2019s critics might tell you right now, he really does stand a decent chance of beating Hillary.\n\nThe bit about the mandate isn\u2019t even the most interesting part. That distinction goes to Trump suggesting, repeatedly, that the only alternative is letting people die in the streets. I\u2019m tempted to call that Obama-esque \u2014 \u201cmy opponents are not just wrong but morally depraved\u201d \u2014 but O tends to reserve that form of argument for foreign policy and gun-control lectures. The guy on the left whom Trump sounds like here is actually Alan Grayson, the most notorious progressive troll in Congress, who stood up on the House floor in 2009 and said, \u201cIf you get sick, America, the Republican health care plan is this: Die quickly.\u201d Trump couldn\u2019t have said it better himself. We\u2019re maybe 10 days away from making this guy the prohibitive favorite for the Republican nomination.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Well.", "title": "Trump on ObamaCare: \u201cI like the mandate\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2016/02/19/trump-on-obamacare-i-like-the-mandate/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "conservative, GOP, mandate, ObamaCare, republican, romney, trump, universal,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-19T16:21:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-19T15:59:37+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Somehow, after six years of conservative agitation against the mandate and a 5-4 Supreme Court majority finding it unconstitutional as an exercise of Congress\u2019s commerce (but not taxi!)\nPartisan tribalism will deliver most Republicans to Trump no matter how many supposed \u201ccore\u201d beliefs he tramples on.\npower, it seems likely we\u2019re going to end up with two consecutive Republican presidential nominees who are pro-mandate.\nThe bit about the mandate isn\u2019t even the most interesting part.\nWe\u2019re maybe 10 days away from making this guy the prohibitive favorite for the Republican nomination."}
