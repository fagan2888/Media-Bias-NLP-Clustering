John Kasich to make headway in a crowded Republican presidential primary, but at least Chris Matthews is a fan.\n\nMatthews was one of several hosts on leftist cable network MSNBC singing Kasich\u2019s praises following the governor\u2019s campaign announcement Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a good story to tell, and he could give Jeb Bush a real fight, believe it or not,\u201d Matthews said on the Tuesday episode of Hardball. \u201cWatch this guy, he\u2019s for real.\u201d\n\nCiting Kasich\u2019s support for policies including Obamacare Medicaid expansion, Common Core and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, Matthews said, \u201cPeople like me tend to like this guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably why people like you don\u2019t,\u201d Matthews continued, scowling at conservative commentator and former Ohio secretary of state Ken Blackwell.\n\nMatthews, a huge fan of President Obama who openly loathes conservative Republicans, has previously suggested Democrat Hillary Clinton should pick Kasich as her running mate.\n\nRELATED: If Gov. Kasich is on the Republican ticket, Obamacare repeal is off the table\n\nMSNBC host Mika Brzezinski offered similar praise when discussing Kasich\u2019s announcement speech on the Wednesday episode of Morning Joe.\n\n\u201cHis speech suggests he will focus on compassionate conservatism,\u201d Brzezinski said before adding, \u201cHe seems so nice and he seems to make so much sense \u2014 how in the world is he going to stand out?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat sort of speech certainly helps you stand out,\u201d said Morning Joe co-host Joe Scarborough, who served in Congress with Kasich.\n\n\u201cMy dad and Kasich are similar in the sense that they are pragmatic, conservative problem solvers,\u201d MSNBC host Abby Huntsman said during Tuesday\u2019s episode of The Cycle.\n\nShe lamented that Republican presidential candidates have \u201cgot to feed the far-right what they want.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, Huntsman wished Kasich luck while noting similarities \u2014 including key staffers \u2014 between Kasich\u2019s campaign and her father Jon\u2019s failed 2012 campaign.\n\n#Kasich roll-out reminds me so much of my dad's four years ago. Same team, same timing, similar strategy. Hope it ends better for him. \u2014 Abby Huntsman (@HuntsmanAbby) July 21, 2015\n\nSteve Kornacki, an MSNBC weekend host and Salon contributor filling in for Rachel Maddow on Tuesday, spent several minutes talking about what a promising candidate Kasich is.\n\n\u201cRepublicans want badly to win back the presidency, and Kasich has a real case to make that he can win over the swing voters who aren\u2019t too nuts these days about the Republican party,\u201d Kornacki said.\n\nAcknowledging Kasich may be \u201cdoomed\u201d in the Republican primary, Kornacki said the governor\u2019s embrace of Obamacare \u201ccould be very attractive in a general election.\u201d\n\nTim Graham, executive editor at NewsBusters, said Kasich is the sort of Republican the legacy press loves to use to paint conservatives as extremists.\n\nLeft-leaning commentators at MSNBC and elsewhere tend to be \u201cmeaner and more vicious to smart conservatives,\u201d Graham told Watchdog.org.\n\nGraham said that after watching spending and deficits increase under \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d George W. Bush, Republican primary voters aren\u2019t likely to go for Kasich\u2019s similar message.\n\n\u201cA lot of conservative voters would say the last thing we need right now is to elect a compassionate conservative \u2014 and see, it sounds terrible, but this is the way the liberals define things,\u201d Graham said.\n\n\u201c\u2018Compassionate\u2019 means you\u2019re socialistic enough,\u201d Graham continued. \u201cLet\u2019s do it the other way: When does the media ever say, \u2018They\u2019re liberal but they\u2019re logical?'\u201d\n\nAnn Becker, a leader of conservative activist group Ohio Rising, wasn\u2019t surprised to see Chris Matthews and other MSNBC hosts pointing to Kasich as a \u201cpragmatic\u201d Republican.\n\n\u201cThe same issues that infuriate conservative grassroots activists in Ohio about Governor Kasich \u2014 Common Core, Obamacare Medicaid expansion and his big spending \u2014 are the reasons the mainstream media loves him,\u201d Becker told Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It may tough for Ohio Gov.
