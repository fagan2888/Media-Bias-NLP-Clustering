For more information, visit www.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/agent/navigators.\n\nThe website allows New Yorkers to shop for and compare health insurance packages online. The exchange also makes it easy for people to check their eligibility for health care programs like Medicaid and Child Health Plus and to sign up for these programs if eligible, Brook-Krasny said.\n\nFor some consumers, coverage can be obtained for free or at a reduced cost through tax credits and subsidies. You may qualify for tax credits if you are an individual earning up to $45,900 a year or a family of four earning up to $94,200 a year.\n\nBrook-Krasny recommended that consumers also check to see if they are eligible for programs such as Medicaid, Child Health Plus, advance premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions, which can lower the cost of coverage.\n\nIndividuals and small businesses with 50 or fewer employees can use the NY State of Health website to shop for coverage. Before NY State of Health was up and running, nearly 2.7 million New Yorkers under the age 65 did not have coverage. It is estimated that 1.1 million New Yorkers will get health coverage through the exchange.\n\nPeople with pre-existing conditions will have access to care if they choose to buy coverage through NY State of Health, according to Brook-Krasny.\n\nBeginning Jan. 1, 2014, most Americans must have health insurance. The ACA requires you to get health coverage if you can afford it, or pay a penalty. The penalty is 1 percent of an individual\u2019s income or $95 per person per year, whichever is more. This penalty is set to increase each year.\n\nHowever, there are circumstances where people may not have to pay a penalty for not having health insurance, Brook-Krasny said. A complete list of exemptions can be found at www.nystateofhealth.ny.gov/exemptions.html.\n\nThe rollout of the federal website, which also took place on Oct. 1, has been an unmitigated disaster, according to members of congress. NBCnews.com reported that a congressional panel held a hearing on Thursday to determine why the website has so many glitches even now, more than three weeks since its debut.\n\nAmericans visiting the website, www.healthcare.gov, have found that the site crashes several times in the course of a few minutes.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.brooklyneagle.com/sites/default/files/Screen%20Shot%202013-10-24%20at%204.20.39%20PM.png"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "description": "If you\u2019re confused by Obamacare and you don\u2019t know how to find your way through the maze of health care exchanges that have been set up to purchase insurance, Assemblyman Alec Brook-Krasny has a solution \u2013 hire a navigator. \"Just as one might consult a tax advisor when filing taxes, navigators, designated and certified by the State of New York, can help you find the best insurance plan to fit your needs,\u201d Brook-Krasny (D-Coney Island-Bay Ridge) told the Brooklyn Daily Eagle."}, "article_summary": "However, there are circumstances where people may not have to pay a penalty for not having health insurance, Brook-Krasny said.\nIf you\u2019re confused by Obamacare and you don\u2019t know how to find your way through the maze of health care exchanges that have been set up to purchase insurance, Assemblyman Alec Brook-Krasny has a solution \u2013 hire a navigator.\nIndividuals and small businesses with 50 or fewer employees can use the NY State of Health website to shop for coverage.\nIt is estimated that 1.1 million New Yorkers will get health coverage through the exchange.\nBeginning Jan. 1, 2014, most Americans must have health insurance."}
