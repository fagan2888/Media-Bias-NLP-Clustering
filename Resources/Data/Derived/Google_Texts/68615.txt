Behind the stage of the Cleo Parker Robinson Theatre, Cleo Parker Robinson was sneaking through the stage door barefoot Sunday afternoon.

High heels in hand, she had changed from her performance outfit back into her long purple skirt and jacket and was heading back to the stage quickly. Dancing and clapping as she moved, Robinson’s mouth broke into a wide grin when her dancers came into her sight.

“This is what I love,” Robinson said.

Robinson founded Cleo Parker Robinson Dance in 1970 when she returned to Denver after studying in New York with Arthur Mitchell. Rooted in African-American traditions, today the company is a cross-cultural, dance-arts and educational institution, performing locally and around the globe.

Sunday’s show, “Cleo on Cleo: Voices of Yesterday and Tomorrow,” was an energetic blend of nostalgia and modern dance, showcasing some of her favorite routines from years past and premiering “Madiba’s River,” a tribute to Nelson Mandela.

The audience also was treated to a rare performance by Robinson. Accompanied by dancer Chris E. Page, Robinson swept across the stage with fluid motion in “Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child.” The piece was created in 1972 as a male solo but was staged to be a duet between a man and a woman this year.

“I never envisioned that it would ever be danced by a woman, and certainly not that the woman would be me,” she wrote in the program notes.

As with most performances by the dance company, hers received a standing ovation.

“I felt so there. There with my mother and all the ancestors,” Robinson said afterward.

Robinson found dance after a heart attack at 11 left her mute for a time. Without words, she learned that dance was a form of communication and began to vigorously study the art, teaching college-level dance by age 15.

“Today I got chills,” Robinson said of the performances.

The company also will perform the show Feb. 28 and March 1 at the Lakewood Cultural Center
