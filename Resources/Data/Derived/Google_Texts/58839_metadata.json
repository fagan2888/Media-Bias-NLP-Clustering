Lincoln Chafee (D) says there has to be better ways for the U.S. to get \u201crapprochement\u201d with Russia than imposing sanctions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about these sanctions. I should think that there would be better ways of getting rapprochement with Russia. They\u2019re so important in the world and especially to the former Soviet republic, such as Ukraine,\u201d Chafee said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nChafee announced a presidential bid for the Democratic ticket last week. He previously served in the Senate as a Republican and as an independent for part of his term as governor.\n\nAt the G-7 meeting in Germany Sunday, President Obama and the German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for sanctions against Russia to remain in place until Russian President Vladimir Putin implements a deal to end fighting in Ukraine.\n\nAsked how he would correct the U.S. relationship with Russia, Chafee used the opportunity to bash his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cStop making mistakes that Secretary Clinton made when we were trying to restart our relations with Russia and Secretary Clinton presented the foreign minister with a symbolic gesture and they got the Russian word wrong. It\u2019s those types of mistakes that set back a relationship \u2014 little symbolic mistakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to wage peace in this world,\u201d said Chafee, who also last week refused to rule out talks with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "\"I don\u2019t know about these sanctions,\" the Democratic presidential candidate said.", "description": "\"I don\u2019t know about these sanctions,\" the Democratic presidential candidate said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Rebecca Shabad", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "\"I don\u2019t know about these sanctions,\" the Democratic presidential candidate said.", "title": "Lincoln Chafee questions US sanctions against Russia", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/international/244243-lincoln-chafee-questions-us-sanctions-against-russia", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/chafeelinoln_041815getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-08T12:22:09-04:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-06-08T12:22-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/international/244243-lincoln-chafee-questions-us-sanctions-against-russia", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-07T12:23-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Shabad", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Sunday shows,Lincoln Chafee,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-07T12:23:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-08T12:22:09-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/international/244243-lincoln-chafee-questions-us-sanctions-against-russia", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "\"I don\u2019t know about these sanctions,\" the Democratic presidential candidate said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Lincoln Chafee questions US sanctions against Russia"}, "dcterms.title": "Lincoln Chafee questions US sanctions against Russia"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcbb8\"", "article_summary": "Lincoln Chafee (D) says there has to be better ways for the U.S. to get \u201crapprochement\u201d with Russia than imposing sanctions.\nAsked how he would correct the U.S. relationship with Russia, Chafee used the opportunity to bash his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\nI should think that there would be better ways of getting rapprochement with Russia.\nHe previously served in the Senate as a Republican and as an independent for part of his term as governor.\nAt the G-7 meeting in Germany Sunday, President Obama and the German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for sanctions against Russia to remain in place until Russian President Vladimir Putin implements a deal to end fighting in Ukraine."}
