Engel sponsored the 2003 Syria Accountability Act, which stated that Syria\u2019s use of weapons of mass destruction would be a direct threat to U.S. national security interests; he also sponsored the \u201cFree Syria Act of 2013\u201d that would have \u201c(authorized) the President to provide lethal and non-lethal weapons to the moderate (Syrian) opposition.\u201d\n\nEngel called on the House to support the President\u2019s push for a \u2018limited\u2019 strike against Syria for its direct violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention:\n\n\u201cWe should not give the president a blank check\u2026any strike should be of a limited nature, and that there should absolutely be no American boots on the ground in Syria.\u201d\n\nEngel reminded the committee that the crisis in Syria is an \u201congoing humanitarian crisis,\u201d and the goal is to \u201cfind a path forward that brings a lasting peace for the Syrian people.\u201d\n\nSecretary Kerry, Secretary Hagel and General Dempsey reiterated almost verbatim their testimonies from the Senate hearing, making a point to emphasize certain elements of their proposals that came under fire from Senators the day before.\n\nSecretary Kerry reiterated his sentiments from the night before concerning the United States\u2019 credibility in the eyes of its allies and enemies.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think, I know, it\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the world is not just watching to see what we decide here, but its watching to see how we decide\u2026can we achieve a single voice?\u201d\n\nKerry reinforced his absolute certainty that the Assad regime was responsible for the use of chemical weapons against Syrian rebels and civilians, and suggested that more information regarding the attack on August 21st, provided by \u201cfriends of Syria\u201d would be released soon. He went on to assert that Assad\u2019s conscious overstep of the President\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d was a direct threat to U.S. national security:\n\n\u201cOnly the most willful desire to avoid reality, only the most devious political purpose could assert that this did not occur. It did happen, and the Bashar al-Assad Regime did it.\u201d \u201dThis is about the world\u2019s red line, this is about humanity\u2019s red line\u2026this is also about Congress\u2019 red line\u2026Congress passed the Syria Accountability Act,\u201d he reminded the committee. He urged Congress to avoid \u201cconsent through silence\u2026Syria is important to America and our security.\u201d\n\nThe Secretary made an obvious effort to clarify his statements from the Senate hearing, when he suggested that he \u201c[didn\u2019t] want to take off the table an option\u2026to secure our country\u201d by putting U.S. military troops on the ground in Syria. He alluded to a new draft of the resolution formed by the Senate that strongly prohibited the use of military forces on the ground.\n\n\u201cWe are not asking America to go to war. (Secretary Hagel and General Dempsey) know the difference between going to war and what the President is asking for. We all agree there will be no American boots on the ground. We have no intention of assuming responsibility for Assad\u2019s civil war; that is not in [the] cards.\u201d\n\nDefense Secretary Hagel also shared a similar testimony to the one he delivered during the Senate hearing; notably, he emphasized the increased threat on U.S. national security if terrorist organizations linked with the Syrian regime were able to gain access to chemical weapons:\n\n\u201cIf Assad is prepared to use chemical weapons against his own people, we have to be concerned that terrorist groups like Hezbollah\u2026could acquire them and use them.\u201d \u201cWe cannot afford for any terrorist group with interest to strike to U.S\u2026.to acquire nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nGeneral Dempsey only provided a few comments in his statement, but made it clear\u2014to the distraught of many Representatives\u2014that \u201cmilitarily, the broader the resolutions, the more options [he] can provide.\u201d\n\nWhile many of the House members were quick to condemn the use of chemical weapons and sympathized with the victims, the Secretaries and General met ample criticism and skepticism from House members who raised a variety of concerns about the looming attack, from potential military repercussions to the costs that will be put on the American taxpayer.\n\nSecretary Kerry was asked by various Representatives, most noticeably Congressman Wilson, why there was no military response in April, 2013 when the Assad regime used chemical weapons against the Syrian people. Wilson went on to ask if the proposed resolution was \u201ca diversion\u201d from the scandals that have plagued Washington over the summer, including the NSA surveillance of American citizens, the IRS\u2019 targeting of conservative groups, the new revelations regarding the attack on the Benghazi consulate, and the ineffectual implementation of Obamacare provisions.\n\nThe Secretary explained that the President felt the previous attacks \u201cmerited an increase of assistance\u201d to the opposition, but did not explain what criteria was used to determine why the attack on August 21st was one that specifically deserved a military response.\n\nCongressman Poe asked General Dempsey to comment on the Administration\u2019s plan if Assad and his allies \u201cshoot back at Americans\u201d after the U.S. carries out its military strike. Dempsey could not guarantee that there would be no push-back from the regime, but cited, \u201cthe contribution we will seek from others begins to eliminate that risk\u201d; however, the General did not give examples of other nations that would be asked to support the United States if the crisis were to escalate.\n\nCongressman Higgans painted a different picture of the Syrian conflict -- one that portrayed the conflict as a fight between a \u201cbrutal dictator\u201d and \u201cIslamic affiliates,\u201d that left the United States with \u201cno good military options,\u201d and very little reason to become involved in the region.\n\n\u201cThis is nothing more than a fight for control between two sectarian factions.\u201d \u201cThere is no democracy movement in Syria.\u201d\n\nThe biggest surprise came late into the hearing, when Secretary Kerry revealed that Arab countries have offered to burden the financial costs of unseating President Assad if the United States handles the military action.
