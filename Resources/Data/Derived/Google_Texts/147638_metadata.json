On a leather sofa nestled in the back of the Broncos\u2019 locker room at Dove Valley, he eats vegetables and watches the upcoming opponent on a big-screen TV. After three games this season, Talib and the Broncos remain in good position but have accomplished nothing.\n\nThey are 2-1, undefeated in their division, and yet work awaits when they return to practice Monday. The Broncos are maddeningly inconsistent, mirroring their secondary, which embraces the challenge of becoming more reliable, more of a force.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting there, man. We still have a long way to go. Once the offense picks up its tempo, we are still fumbling a little bit,\u201d Talib said. \u201cWe still got a ways to go before we get to that level we are seeking.\u201d\n\nRepetitions represent the answer, minutes together on the field. The defense\u2019s addition of strong safety T.J. Ward and Talib has featured glimpses of the blueprint sketched in April of a dominant back line. Ward had a sack against the Seattle Seahawks. Talib has graded out as one of the NFL\u2019s top cornerbacks this season. Cornerback Chris Harris continues to show encouraging progress after knee surgery, and safety Rahim Moore leads the Broncos with two interceptions.\n\nThe breakdowns are fewer, the communication better. Still, occasionally something doesn\u2019t click and the opposition converts a third down. Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson converted two on the final overtime drive last week. Denver\u2019s defense ranks 26th in the 32-team league in third-down percentage but ninth in red-zone touchdowns allowed.\n\nThe picture painted of the secondary, like the team, is accurate: good but uneven.\n\n\u201cThey are improving, moving in the right direction,\u201d coach John Fox said. \u201cThe goal is to be more consistent.\u201d\n\nThe defensive backs remain confident. They view any grade, any impression, as incomplete. Their view is not without merit. Denver improved its talent in the secondary in free agency. The Broncos moved quickly, signing Ward, coveted for his high football IQ and known toughness; and Talib, the best cornerback Peyton Manning said he faced last season. But the starting secondary in the opener against the Indianapolis Colts didn\u2019t play a single snap together during the preseason, a concession to Harris\u2019 recovery.\n\nOnly now is the puzzle starting to resemble a picture, not scattered pieces.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the NFL. It\u2019s not a fantasy league. This is our life. I feel like this is the best secondary I have ever played with,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s getting to the point where you don\u2019t watch over a player or lean one way because a guy might be a little iffy in coverage. Man, all these guys make plays. The NFL is the best of the best. And I feel like we have the best. We will be great.\u201d\n\nTalent fosters bravado. Chemistry and familiarity will create the results this group seeks. Part of the issue is finding comfort in the scheme. Ward, like Moore a game film junkie, calls out signals, makes adjustments. It\u2019s easy to forget this is his first year in coordinator Jack Del Rio\u2019s defense. The secondary is leaving plays on the field.\n\n\u201cThere are so many fine points within the scheme of the defense. Some things don\u2019t come up until you make a mistake,\u201d said Ward, who played his best game as a Bronco last Sunday but lamented two missed tackles. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting to where I am doing things where it\u2019s just second nature.\u201d\n\nDenver continues to find a balance between zone and man coverage. The Broncos have played better in zone but possess the talent to press off the line of scrimmage with Talib and Harris.\n\n\u201cWe can play man all day,\u201d Harris said.\n\nCoverage connects to pressure, and the secondary saw gains last week as the defensive ends applied consistent heat on Wilson inside the pocket. Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware netted sacks, and the defense had a total of 21 quarterback hurries. The secondary shut down Seattle in the third and fourth quarters, holding Wilson to 74 yards on 15 pass attempts.\n\n\u201cWe made adjustments at halftime. We played all right. We could have played better,\u201d Talib said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get stops when we needed them right before half and of course in overtime. That\u2019s when we really needed them. I feel like all of us are comfortable. We have guys who can play man and zone. Either way, we are going to be all right.\u201d\n\nThree games represent a chapter, not a conclusion. The secondary has not reached its potential. The only thing standing between the goal is rolled-up sleeves.\n\n\u201cThere are some things we need to fix, to challenge more throws, to eliminate explosives, and to keep having fun. All that will come,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot of film study, a lot of sacrifice, a lot of hunger. But we are going to get this rolling, and we will be good. We will be special.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
