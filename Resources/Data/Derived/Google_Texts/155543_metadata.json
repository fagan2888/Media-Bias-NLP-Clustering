In 2013, the uninsured rate for children in Kentucky was 5.9 percent.\n\nThe report was released by the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky and State Health Access Data Assistance Center, a health policy research institute at the University of Minnesota.\n\nThe report looked at the two main mechanisms that have had the most impact on Kentucky children under the ACA: financial assistance for families purchasing private insurance and increased enrollment in public coverage.\n\n\u201cHaving a usual source of care and having a primary care home, it\u2019s just very important that that\u2019s established early in life and that becomes part of taking care of yourself and your health over time,\u201d said Lynn Blewett, director of the State Health Access Data Assistance Center.\n\nKentucky had a 90 percent participation rate in Medicaid \u2014 the percentage of children enrolled in the program \u2014 before the ACA went into effect. But that left 43,000 children eligible for Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, or K-CHIP, who were not enrolled.\n\nBlewett said with more adults signing up for coverage, more children were enrolled as well.\n\n\u201cFor kids to enroll, they have to have their parents to sign up. And so, if the parents don\u2019t sign up, the kids don\u2019t get coverage. So, it really depends on the parents,\u201d she said.\n\nTerry Brooks, executive director of Kentucky Youth Advocates, said health insurance is necessary for many children to receive quality and accessible health services.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those domino effects, that if we believe health impacts every aspect of a child\u2019s life, then we have to go upstream and figure out how to make sure that they have access to health care,\u201d he said.\n\nOf those who gained coverage through the state health insurance marketplace, Kynect, 10.6 percent \u2014 or about 11,000 \u2014 were children under the age of 18.\n\nKentucky\u2019s percentage of children enrolled in health insurance through the state marketplace was better than the national average of state marketplaces (5.7 percent) and plans bought on the federal exchange (8 percent).\n\nIn December 2013, child enrollment in Medicaid and K-CHIP was 447,838, according to Georgetown University. In May 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that 523,448 Kentucky children were enrolled in the program.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The analysis shows that the uninsured rate for Kentucky children dropped to 4.3 percent in 2014.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "The analysis shows that the uninsured rate for Kentucky children dropped to 4.3 percent in 2014.", "title": "Kentucky Children Benefiting Under Affordable Care Act, Report Says", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1600, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4927466850_0f231ee608_o-e1441850166507.jpg", "height": 656}, "updated_time": "2015-10-20T10:46:46-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/kentucky-children-benefiting-affordable-care-act-report-says/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The analysis shows that the uninsured rate for Kentucky children dropped to 4.3 percent in 2014.", "creator": "@JaNelSJohnson", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4927466850_0f231ee608_o-e1441850166507.jpg", "title": "Kentucky Children Benefiting Under Affordable Care Act, Report Says", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Health", "tag": "affordable care act", "published_time": "2015-10-19T17:55:29-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-20T10:46:46-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "More than 16,000 Kentucky children gained health care coverage in the first year of the federal Affordable Care Act, according to a report released Monday.\nThe analysis shows that the uninsured rate for Kentucky children dropped to 4.3 percent in 2014.\nIn May 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that 523,448 Kentucky children were enrolled in the program.\nTerry Brooks, executive director of Kentucky Youth Advocates, said health insurance is necessary for many children to receive quality and accessible health services.\nKentucky had a 90 percent participation rate in Medicaid \u2014 the percentage of children enrolled in the program \u2014 before the ACA went into effect."}
