He will know that efforts to fund his campaign outdid \u201cReady for Hillary\u201d efforts at one point and give promise to the kind of money and network that might just fund a winning presidential primary campaign. He is a man of serious faith and he will have prayed for guidance.\n\nDr. Carson will walk to the podium, look out at the cheering crowd and the flashing cameras and he will tell them how he intends to fight for the future of this country.\n\nHe should say something like this:\n\nMy fellow Americans, America is a nation in crisis. We have an addiction to debt that is unsustainable. Our entitlement programs are consuming ever greater amounts of our resources but our political leadership, media, and yes, we ourselves as citizens have refused to face the realities of this challenge. Our moral compass is compromised, the value of the traditional family is under question, and far too many children are being born out of wedlock. Americans are not saving nearly enough for the longer lives we\u2019re enjoying because of advances in medical science. And speaking of medicine, something I know a thing or two about: Obamacare is a job-killing, spiderweb of complexity that needs to be repealed and replaced. We face a growing threat from terrorists abroad, ISIS continues to amass territory and destroy world treasures. China is aggressively seizing waters claimed by our allies, and Russia is restoring its pride by reducing that of their neighbors, either consuming neighbors\u2019 territory or fostering the fear that their territory will be consumed. And Iran, a nation in which a national chant is \u201cDeath to America\u201d and a national purpose is the genocide of Jews, seeks a nuclear weapon. This must not be allowed to happen. This election will be transformative \u2014 not just for this country but for the world. There is much at stake, and I intend to explain this to people in Iowa, in Florida, in New Hampshire, in South Carolina, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. I know that I can reach people other politicians can\u2019t. I intend to build this party, broaden this party and see this party through to victory in 2016. But I will do it as a citizen, not as a candidate for President of the United States.\n\nDr. Carson is unlikely to do such a thing. His closest supporters will be reminding him of history\u2019s longshots. David slew Goliath. Lincoln won after a single term in Congress. There are millions of dollars raised for the expected Carson run. But it\u2019s what he should do.\n\nIt\u2019s not because he doesn\u2019t have support. He rounded out the top three GOP contenders at one point and still polls in the middle of the pack. Plus, everybody is sick of \u201cWashington insiders\u201d and no one could credibly accuse him of being that. But an honest assessment would tell the doctor that much of this support is unlikely to last.\n\nDr. Carson is a good man. His life story is inspirational and proves what is possible with hard work and the love of a mother. His medical accomplishments are dazzling and command reverence and respect. But the world the next president inherits will be one fraught with immediate dangers, while Dr. Carson revealed in a radio interview last month that he was not ready to answer basic questions about Russia and challenges to NATO allies.\n\nWhat about political experience? While he\u2019s not a \u201cWashington insider,\u201d political skills are still required to get things done in Washington and throughout the world. Having some experience in how Washington works or how government bureaucracies work to thwart their political masters is also key to being an effective executive.\n\nAmongst the other nearly 20 candidates flirting with the GOP presidential bid are there not several who hold the same core values and key concerns that Dr. Carson has expressed? Rather than raise millions of dollars for a campaign about a candidate Carson, might he not be more effective raising money to advocate for the issues he is most passionate about?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3275\"", "article_summary": "Amongst the other nearly 20 candidates flirting with the GOP presidential bid are there not several who hold the same core values and key concerns that Dr. Carson has expressed?\nDr. Carson is unlikely to do such a thing.\nDr. Carson is a good man.\nDr. Carson will walk to the podium, look out at the cheering crowd and the flashing cameras and he will tell them how he intends to fight for the future of this country.\nI intend to build this party, broaden this party and see this party through to victory in 2016."}
