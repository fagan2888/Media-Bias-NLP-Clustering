I have a mental illness. I ask for more after hours mental health programs and services.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood evening, my name is Dan McGilligan, and along with my colleagues Ron Fitzpatrick and Kevin Foley\u2026we endeavour with other people and agencies to help those who have issues with mental illness, and sometimes they\u2019re at high risk and high need and have co-occurring disorders of addictions and PTSD. At times we have to go into provincial and federal jails, and there are many there, many violent people, but there are also many non-violent who suffer from these disorders. So our ask is that we be more informed as a community so that we can decriminalize mental illness.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Grant Fitzpatrick, I\u2019m the mental health facilitator for the Canadian Mental Health Association. I teach the Think Twice anti-stigma program to youth all across the province. My ask is to decrease the stigma in order to increase the communication and understanding surrounding mental health issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Glen Roil. I am a person with lived experience. I sit on the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador Legislative Stakeholder\u2019s Committee for Mental Health and Treatment Care Act. My ask this evening is to have a mental health and addictions wellness transition and respite centre for people, that they can go if they are too sick to be at home and not sick enough to be in hospital, and have a place that they can have counselling and just have a break from life.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Paula Corcoran and I work with CHANNAL. I live with a mental illness. I strive with my mental illness. And I want a provincial 24-hour peer-run warm line. I want to know that at any time, no matter where I am, I can pick up the phone and have someone to talk to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Barbara Burnaby and I\u2019m from the Refugee and Immigrant Advisory Council and the Coalition on Richer Diversity. Over the past month more refugees have crossed over from Syria into Turkey every day than there are people in Newfoundland and Labrador. So provincially we want a funded program to coordinate and support diagnosis and focused treatment for mental health issues faced by newcomers and refugees in Newfoundland and Labrador.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur names are Helen and Keith Hillier, and we are the foster parents of a son who has a mental health condition. Through the Choices for Youth program we have housed over 30 youth in the last nine years with multiple mental health problems. We have seen the devastation and witnessed the heartbreak of those living with mental illness. And those human beings struggle on a daily basis. I am not asking but rather pleading with government to please help bridge the gap in medicare to place much-needed funding in more programs to educate and remove the barriers that leave people with mental illness in poverty and to live lonely and isolated lives. Mental illness is the same as cancer, heart and stroke, and we too have to find a cure for this situation.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Jennifer Rimmer. I represent the deaf community. I think tonight is absolutely fabulous. The different organizations that are all listed here in the pamphlet are beautiful, but what about me? I\u2019m deaf. Where\u2019s my accessibility? That\u2019s my ask.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood evening, I\u2019m Dr. Brenda LeFrancois. I am a psychologist and a social work educator at MUN, and I\u2019m asking that we come together as a community and we develop the kinds of alternative services that we know exists and works elsewhere in the world. I\u2019m talking about alternative services like the Hearing Voices Network, the open dialogue approach, the Soteria Houses, and other 24-hour crisis houses, just to name a few. So let\u2019s just do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am George Skinner with the Canadian Mental Health Association Newfoundland and Labrador. And my ask is that all persons who suffer with mental illness receive the respect, acceptance and treatment equivalent to those persons who suffer from cancer, heart disease, diabetes, etc.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Andrea Boundridge. I\u2019m a deaf community representative. I am here to say you all learn about mental health through hearing about it on the radio or on the TV, and you hear a lot about what\u2019s going on. But when it comes to the deaf community there is no accessibility for seeing what is going on and hearing what we are discussing, even now. So we need to have more information, more access for the deaf community. It needs to be captioned, it needs to be signed. Something that will have them all involved and not ignored.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Connie Pike with the Coalition Against Violence. We ask for patience, for understanding, and for supportive families to be included in the process of helping their loved one back to mental wellness.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Amelia Reimer and I\u2019m Cultural Support Worker with the St. John\u2019s Native Friendship Centre, and my asks the evening are for culturally appropriate services, including services sensitive to multi-generational and institutional traumas. Shorter waiting periods for services; six months to two years is too long. And better communication and cooperation between service providers. Stop the misinformation and the runarounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Sheilagh O\u2019Leary and I\u2019m the founder of the Tickle Swim for Mental Health, a fundraiser and awareness project whereby people swim to Bell Island Tickle to raise awareness and end stigma. My wish is to dispel stigma and loneliness from mental illness by developing a more holistic approach by creating programs that make mental and physical health, beginning in our schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name Boyd Perry. I am one of two councillors here at Holy Heart High School. We have over 960 students. My ask is for more councillors in our schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Jenny Wright and I work with the St. John\u2019s Status of Women Council. We ask for women\u2019s health and resource centre to support the unique mental health and addictions issues faced by women in our communities.\u201d\n\n\u201cHello everyone. I\u2019m Heather Pollett with the Canadian Mental Health Association. I\u2019m asking for more respect from government and the regional health authorities for the experience, expertise and people in community non-profit organizations who support recovery from mental illness for all Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. We are equal partners in mental health.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Peggy Hann. I\u2019m the proud president of NLCPA, the Newfoundland and Labrador Cousellor\u2019s and Psychologists\u2019 Association. We represent counsellors and psychologists who work in our schools. The work that we do is very important. Counsellors and psychologists make a difference. They have a very unique skillset. We know that talk therapy works. We know that there\u2019s a lot of prevention and intervention strategies that work. We really need more of us. We need a minimum of 1:250 with respect to school counsellors, and 1:1,000 with respect to school psychologists. We need to be consistent with the rest of Canada and with our international bodies.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Megan Barnhill and I\u2019m a community activist. My ask is that when someone comes to the mental health system and says that I need help, that they\u2019re not given a two-year wait list and that they\u2019re helped before the situation gets worse.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood evening. My name is Donna Kavanagh and I\u2019m the retired coordinator of College of the North Atlantic\u2019s Waterford Bridge Road Centre, which supported students with psychiatric illness. When government privatized this program in 2013, a lot of the supports and services that are known are essential to allowing people to become what they should were cut. I am asking government to restore those supports and services.\u201d\n\n\u201cHello everyone. My name is Sean Kennedy and I\u2019m with the MUN students\u2019 union Canadian Federation of Students Local 35, and what we\u2019re asking for is for improved counselling services on our campus. Right now we are asking for something we don\u2019t have but desperately need, and that\u2019s a permanent psychologist.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, my name is Courtney Jones and I\u2019m with the MUN students\u2019 union Canadian Federation of Students Local 35. In order to have well-funded mental health supports at Memorial University and the College of the North Atlantic we need to have well-funded post-secondary institutions. Funding for post secondary education is funding for mental health supports, and it needs to continue to be prioritized.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Brenda O\u2019Brien and I\u2019m a member of the Autism Society of Newfoundland and Labrador and the parent of a son with autism. And for him and the 1 in 68 children who will become adults who have been diagnosed with autism, I ask for tolerance, friendship and acceptance. But I also ask for prompt access to the medically-prescribed, evidence-based treatments like speech language pathology, occupational therapy, and applied behaviour analysis from the time of diagnosis until they no longer need treatment. And not to be arbitrarily cut off by age, IQ or income.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Susan Rose, President of Egale Canada, and one of the things we do is we work to eliminate depression, anxiety and suicide, and we are asking to continue this extremely important work of making our schools safe and inclusive for our lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans youth in this province.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, I\u2019m Aaron, I\u2019m a facilitator with the Better Days Support Society. My ask would be that we have a system that focuses on prevention and diagnosis, and not just crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi, name is Ed Sawdon and I\u2019m a 2013 Governor General\u2019s Caring Canadian Award recipient. And I\u2019m also a member of various organizations and I\u2019ve received awards from those organizations. And this is what I ask: I ask that the governments, both federal and provincial, implement a universally-accessible and affordable pharmacare program for all Canadians and Newfoundlanders and Labradorians who have mental health issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Tina Davies. I lost my son Richard to suicide. I am the founder of Richard\u2019s Legacy Foundation for survivors of suicide loss. Did you know that in Newfoundland and Labrador we lose more than one person a week to suicide? I ask for a provincial strategy and us to be leaders in a national strategy for suicide prevention. I ask for zero suicides.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Elaine Byrant and I\u2019m also with Richard\u2019s Legacy and survivors of suicide. I too lost my only daughter to suicide, and I\u2019m asking government for province-wide crisis centres for people who need a safe place. And I\u2019m also asking you, the voting public, to seek a government who makes mental illness a priority.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi my name is Jackie Taylor. I too am with the Richard Legacy Foundation. I also lost my son a short while ago to a mental health illness, and I\u2019m asking to put an end to the stigma surrounding suicide and suicide loss, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Angela Wilmott. I\u2019m a school consellor and President elect for the Newfoundland and Labrador Counsellors and Psychologists\u2019 Association. I dream for a time when all services are funded adequately to meet the needs, so people who are in helping professions, like myself, are not getting burnt out so we continue to help. And, but at the end of the day we\u2019re resourced at a level where guidance counsellors in schools can focus on the potential of our young people and get them to a place where they\u2019re truly happy and content with themselves, versus putting out fires and trying to save lives.\u201d\n\nMy name\u2019s Karen LeMessurier, and I\u2019m a registered nurse and a homecare worker. I lost a brother to suicide after a long battle with mental illness, so I ask that all of you continue to do what you\u2019re doing right now, which is support and talk and support. And I also ask that there be more healthcare initiatives that are directed at mental health.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy name is Gerry Rogers. I work for the people of St. John\u2019s Centre. My ask is that everyone\u2014everyone\u2014have access to safe, affordable housing, and that we all continue to do this work together with courage, with determination, and with hope.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://theindependent.ca/2014/10/18/asks-for-improved-mental-health-and-mental-illness-prevention-and-services-in-nl/", "site_name": "TheIndependent.ca", "type": "article", "description": "Dozens of people affected by mental health and mental illness took to the stage Oct. 15 at Holy Heart Auditorium in St. John's to share their", "title": "\u201cAsks\u201d for improved mental health and mental illness prevention and services in NL"}, "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Dozens of people affected by mental health and mental illness took to the stage Oct. 15 at Holy Heart Auditorium in St. John's to share their"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe12b0\"", "article_summary": "Through the Choices for Youth program we have housed over 30 youth in the last nine years with multiple mental health problems.\nSo our ask is that we be more informed as a community so that we can decriminalize mental illness.\u201d\u201cMy name is Grant Fitzpatrick, I\u2019m the mental health facilitator for the Canadian Mental Health Association.\nWe have seen the devastation and witnessed the heartbreak of those living with mental illness.\nI sit on the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador Legislative Stakeholder\u2019s Committee for Mental Health and Treatment Care Act.\nMental illness is the same as cancer, heart and stroke, and we too have to find a cure for this situation.\u201d\u201cMy name is Jennifer Rimmer."}
