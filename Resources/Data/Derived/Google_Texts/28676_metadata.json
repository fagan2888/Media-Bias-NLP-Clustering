Yet her regret is not the gruesome near-fatal trauma she endured, it's that people she loves so deeply witnessed it.\n\n''My brothers, cousins, one of my dad's friends, my nan and pop were there,'' she says of that day, back in her native South Africa, when she was just 10. ''I'm OK but it's impacted my family in a horrible way. The memories - you never get something like that out of your head. That's what upsets me the most. I can't imagine what they've gone through.''\n\nThe family never let on about the way the amputation affected them, the engaging teenager says.\n\nA younger Joany Badenhorst competes in athletics.\n\nHer mother Petro quit her teaching job to care for her. Her architect father Peter brought the family to Australia, largely to get the best medical attention. And brothers Garret and Peter helped at every turn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n''They've been like a rock for me. I'm sure they all struggled, but they never let me know. They love me.''\n\nEarly next year, however, there may be no hiding emotion, when Badenhorst, now 19, competes in front of the world.\n\nJoany Badenhorst snowboards through Perisher Valley.

Badenhorst competed in dancing and athletics, but loved being home, where the kids rode horses and bikes, played in the cubby-house and swam in the river.\n\nJuly 12, 2005, was a regular day. The kids played as Peter and a farmhand back-burned, using a tractor power take-off to pump water on the flames. During a break, Badenhorst leant on the plough. When the farmhand restarted the engine, it caught her leg and ripped it off below the knee.\n\n''I got a cold shock through my body,'' she says. ''I looked down and saw blood everywhere. I was just screaming.''\n\nPetro kept talking to keep her daughter awake as they waited for help. The ambulance couldn't get through the terrain, so they drove to a neighbour's air strip, where a mercy flight picked her up. ''I remember the medics on the flight saying aloud that they didn't think I would make it,'' she says.\n\nAfter nine hours of surgery, Badenhorst woke to begin her new life. ''It all seemed dreamlike,'' she says, shaking her head. ''I just remember being so thirsty.''\n\nThere were setbacks in the ensuing months and years. But Badenhorst's determination was unstoppable. After attending school in a wheelchair or on crutches, she got a prosthetic leg and came second in the school 100 metres event. She joined the South African Paralympic program and competed at the 2009 Paralympic Youth Games.\n\n''It was never about gold medals,'' she says. ''I just wanted to keep up with my friends.''\n\nWhen she moved to Australia four years ago, she narrowly missed qualifying for the London Games. But her skills were seen by snowboarding coach Peter Higgins as transferable to the snow.\n\n''He asked if I'd be interested in joining winter sports. I said yes straight away,'' she says.\n\nJust months later, Badenhorst finds herself on the cusp of a wonderful experience.\n\n''I've got those moments still where I can't believe what happened to me, losing my leg like that, and I start crying,'' she says. ''But, I don't know, I never thought my life was over or anything. The support that I had was amazing and, great things have happened. I think it's been a blessing in disguise. I really wouldn't change anything.''", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "National, Winter Olympics", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "There are moments when Joany Badenhorst struggles to accept what happened.
