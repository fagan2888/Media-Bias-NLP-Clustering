But the 60-year-old had a serious knee injury, then surgery, that he said left him unable to work for the first time in his life.\n\n\u201cMentally, it\u2019s a mind-screw\u201d to be out of work, Vopal said. \u201cIt definitely twists the brain.\u201d\n\nVopal says his service in the Marines during the Vietnam War left him with post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\u201cThere were times when I wanted my life to end,\u201d Vopal said. He attempted suicide in his 30s and used drugs.\n\nDecades later, Vopal is receiving mental-health services through the homeless shelter.\n\nAcross the city in a quiet neighborhood, Danielle remembers a day six years ago when her son attacked her.\n\nClick play to hear Emilie Ritter Saunders and Audrey Dutton talk with host Jodie Martinson about the series, \"In Crisis.\"\n\n\u201cMy husband left for work, and my son was being perfectly charming ... \u2018Bye, Daddy, I love you,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe door shuts, we hear the lock click. My son turns around, at the age of 3, and says, \u2018Now I\u2019m coming after you, Mommy.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere are alarms on the boy\u2019s bedroom door and window, and Danielle has taken classes to learn how to physically restrain him. She is desperate to get him into a residential therapy program.\n\nVopal and Danielle\u2019s son are two of Idaho\u2019s thousands of residents with mental illnesses.\n\nIdaho\u2019s mental-health system is fragmented and threadbare. It lacks resources \u2014 too few psychiatrists, too few options for Medicaid patients, too few 24-hour highly skilled treatment facilities for people with serious issues.\n\nAnd, while Medicaid rolls swelled after the recession, Idaho didn\u2019t increase its spending on mental health; the overall Department of Health and Welfare budget skyrocketed, while mental health got a smaller share.\n\nWHERE WE STAND\n\nWhen Idahoans with mental illness go untreated and their disorders spin out of control, they end up in crisis care at an emergency room, a state hospital or a local jail.\n\nThe state\u2019s behavioral health program, which is separate from Medicaid, serves some of those people.\n\nSome organizations are catching Idahoans who\u2019ve fallen through the cracks \u2014 courts, hospitals and even homeless shelters started new programs, especially for people who don\u2019t have insurance.\n\nBut that hasn\u2019t been enough to solve the problem.\n\nIdaho still has one of the country\u2019s highest suicide rates \u2014 on average, 48 percent higher than the national suicide rate.\n\nAbout 13 percent of impoverished Idaho adults who lack health insurance have a serious mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder.\n\nAbout half of the chronically homeless Idahoans who seek shelter at the Boise Rescue Mission are there \u201cas a direct result of an untreated mental illness and chemical dependency and alcohol abuse, because many people with an untreated mental illness will self-medicate with alcohol and other drugs,\u201d said the Rev. Bill Roscoe, president and CEO of the Boise Rescue Mission.\n\nThe reason they\u2019re untreated?\n\n\u201cMostly, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t have access to mental health care,\u201d Roscoe said.\n\nCHANGING THE SYSTEM\n\nState lawmakers and agencies are making big changes to Idaho\u2019s fractured mental-health landscape \u2014 with the goal of creating a more efficient system. Some frontline providers and mental-health consumers are skeptical that the changes will work.\n\nLast year, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare hired Optum Idaho to take over the non-hospital portion of Medicaid\u2019s mental-health services \u2014 like therapy and psychiatry appointments.\n\nAt the same time, Idaho is investing $45,000 in regional boards to link mental-health patients with community resources.\n\nThe most tangible effort the state is making is a new crisis center in Idaho Falls, giving people in crisis a place to go that isn\u2019t an emergency room or jail cell. State officials wanted to open three of those crisis centers this year, but only got enough money from the Legislature for one \u2014 a kind of pilot project.\n\nARE THOSE CHANGES MAKING A DIFFERENCE?\n\nThe Idaho Falls crisis center is expected to open this fall. Its data will be closely watched by state officials.\n\nIn its first year, Optum Idaho\u2019s takeover of Medicaid outpatient care has been fraught with payment errors, claims problems and long wait times. It also has meant people who relied on certain services under the old way of doing things aren\u2019t offered for those same services today.\n\nBut the company says it has opened new doors for Idahoans with mental illness \u2014 pumping up the roster of providers who will take Medicaid patients and offering mental-health first aid training to the public, for example.\n\nExpanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act would allow more people with untreated mental illness to pay for treatment. State lawmakers are unlikely, though, to take up a Medicaid expansion bill in the next legislative session.\n\nThe legion of homeless men who come through the Boise Rescue Mission\u2019s doors are among the most likely to benefit from such an expansion. They can\u2019t access preventive mental-health care now, because the state doesn\u2019t offer Medicaid to most poor, childless adults.\n\nMore than 22 percent of uninsured adults who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid now \u2014 but would, if Idaho expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 were in \u201cserious psychological distress\u201d over a one-year period, according to a 2013 report from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nNOT ENOUGH HELP AVAILABLE\n\nDanielle didn\u2019t want her last name published because she\u2019s worried a public spotlight would pile extra stress onto her children, including her son. He was adopted as an infant and developed an alphabet soup of psychiatric disorders \u2014 ODD, ADHD, PTSD, RAD and a conduct disorder, which means it\u2019s hard for him to follow rules and he is driven to misbehave, sometimes violently.\n\nDanielle is frustrated by the lack of options for children like her son, who often must be sent out of state for residential care. She has been fighting the state to be willing to pay for that level of care, which costs upwards of $10,000 to $14,000 a month.\n\nShe acknowledges that it\u2019s expensive, but she believes her son will soon start costing taxpayers more \u2014 in the criminal justice system.\n\n\u201cI think I vacillate between anger and sadness, because I think we can do better by these children,\u201d Danielle said. \u201cOur system is flawed. It needs more continuity, especially with these kinds of kids.\u201d\n\n\"In Crisis\" is a series exploring Idaho's mental health system.
