Vergennes police are investigating their second bank robbery in two weeks following a spike in robberies in the area.

“It's crazy, crazy…Insane, it doesn't happen here,” said resident Sue Lamonda.

LaMonda has lived in Vergennes most of her life. When she heard about the robbery at the Vermont Federal Credit Union in town Friday afternoon she was more than a little surprised.

“Nothing happens here and to have the same thing happen in two weeks it's nuts,” LaMonda said.

Police say this man walked into the bank on Panton Road and demanded cash. After a teller gave him money, he drove away in a gray four door sedan heading south on Panton road towards West Main Street.

“He had a head start on us and we were on pretty much all the major streets covering all the traffic in and out of town but by that time, I think the individual may had already gone,” said Vergennes Police Chief George Merkel.

Just two weeks ago, the People's Bank on Maple Street in Vergennes was hit. That time, the criminal had a knife. Police haven't determined if there is a connection.

“We don't know at this time, there are some similarities but at this point we're not sure,” Merkel said.

The recent string of bank robberies makes LaMonda, who often works nights, nervous.

“I think personally it's because of the drugs and if they get away with it once they're going to try doing it again, again and again until they get caught and eventually they do,” LaMonda said.
