Thad Cochran has to go,\u201d the couple sang for 70 Mississippians from a stage at the side of a Ramada Inn. Behind the band hung a \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d flag. \u201cThose bailouts have to stop,\u201d went another song. \u201cThat stimulus must end. Repeal Obama health care. No cap-and-trade my friend.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSusan Barnett, a former teacher who has known Mr. McDaniel since he was a toddler, exhorted the crowd: \u201cWho is going to elect our nominee? Let\u2019s not let it be the special-interest lobbyists.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to select our senatorial candidate. We the people will select him. It will not be the political machine and the Republican old guard.\u201d\n\nThe crowd cheered as Ms. Barnett and each of the roughly one dozen speakers, including the talk radio host Lars Larson, railed against the nation\u2019s capital or against Mr. Cochran. In a county where Mr. McDaniel won 85 percent of the vote in the June 3 race that led to the runoff scheduled for Tuesday, any attack on his opponent \u2014 personal or political \u2014 was sure to draw boisterous applause and hollering.\n\nThis race has been described as featuring more mudslinging than any in this election cycle. On the stump, Mr. McDaniel is far more polite, taking pains to note how he respects Mr. Cochran\u2019s record. Then he attacks it.\n\n\u201cSenator Cochran has been there for 42 years, and no one can name a single fight that he\u2019s led for the conservative movement,\u201d Mr. McDaniel said at an event in Madison, a wealthy suburb of Jackson, on Thursday night with former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. \u201cHe wants to scare you into voting for the status quo.\u201d\n\nMr. McDaniel accompanied the Tea Party Express bus on its Saturday stop to Tupelo, and he was scheduled to ride with it to Biloxi on Sunday for an event hours before Mr. Cochran was to host Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, a few miles away in Gulfport.\n\nFor as much as the campaign has been portrayed as a battle between the Tea Party and the establishment, both candidates were relying on established star power as they made their closing arguments. Mr. Cochran\u2019s events with Mr. McCain on Sunday in Biloxi and Monday in Jackson are his campaign\u2019s largest ending rallies, and the Chamber of Commerce was broadcasting a television advertisement supporting the incumbent that featured the former Green Bay Packer quarterback Brett Favre, a Mississippi native.\n\nMr. McDaniel brought Mr. Santorum, who spent 16 years in Washington, to Mississippi on Thursday, and the candidate has benefited from television ads broadcast during time paid for by the Club for Growth, a political advocacy group based in Washington.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nVal Root, a Florida Tea Party activist who teaches gifted elementary students, traveled to Mississippi with her husband to campaign for Mr. McDaniel and to distribute the American Patriot News, a newsletter they produce.\n\n\u201cI think Washington is a beautiful city, but it\u2019s one of the more corrupt places you could ever think of,\u201d Ms. Root said. \u201cWhen we send good candidates up there, it only takes two or three weeks before they fall into step.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how she could be certain Mr. McDaniel would not follow the same path if elected, she said she could not. But then she added, \u201cWell, I think we have to trust some people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140622135941, "twitter": {"description": "The Republican candidate\u2019s
