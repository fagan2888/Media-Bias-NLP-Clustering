Stamos is expected to have a producer role also.\n\nWarner Bros. and Netflix have not confirmed the show's return.\n\nAccess Hollywood said this is not the first time there has been a \"Full House\" reunion. In 2014, Stamos, Saget and Coulier reprised their roles for a Dannon Oikos Super Bowl ad. They also appeared on Jimmy Fallon's show for a reunion skit.\n\nCameron Bure and Barber have stayed friends since the series ended. They recently competed in a \"Tough Mudder\" event together.\n\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"4\" ><div > <div > <div ></div></div> <p > <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/0-r60up8du/\" target=\"_top\">Here's 2 one of the best & longest friendships in T.V. history!
