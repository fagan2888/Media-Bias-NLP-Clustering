The contracts were for computer and software development at the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Commerce, and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nOne contract, for instance, was signed Oct. 19 by Department of Commerce officials that gives CGI Federal $266,164 to provide \"IT and Telecom Systems Development\" for the Patent Office.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nThe Commerce Department did not respond to inquiries from FoxNews.com about why they made the deal.\n\nBut CGI Federal defended that contract, saying the contract signing this month was essentially a technicality and an extension of an existing contract.\n\n\u201cCGI continues to deliver technology services and support under an existing contract agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office,\u201d Linda Odorisio, Vice President of Communications for CGI, told FoxNews.com.\n\n\u201cIt is the type work that has contributed to CGI's solid history of delivery and service to its government clients for more than 35 years,\u201d she added.\n\nBut critics say it is absurd to give the company more government money and work at a time when other work they have done for the government is going poorly.\n\n\u201cThis is a typical example of government creating perverse incentives,\u201d George Mason University economics professor Donald Boudreaux told FoxNews.com. \u201cUnlike, say, a private homeowner who fires a contractor who does a poor job, the government rewards such poorly performing contractors with new work at lucrative rates.\u201d\n\nCGI Federal was paid $290 million for its work in creating the ObamaCare exchange, and it was the one contractor that administration officials said failed to meet some expectations.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had some issues with timely delivery,\u201d Marilyn Tavenner, the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in testimony to Congress last week.\n\nCriticism of the contracts spans the political aisle.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a problem,\u201d said Alice Chen, who supports ObamaCare and is executive director of Doctors for America. \u201cI think you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHealth policy experts also criticized the contracts.\n\n\u201cCGI Federal has no real skillset and a lot of the projects they've worked on have failed,\u201d Avik Roy, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who attended congressional hearings on the ObamaCare exchange failures, told FoxNews.com.\n\nBut he added that the failure is no surprise, considering the bureaucratic way that contracts are awarded.\n\n\u201cIn order to get through the procurement process of the federal government, you have to go through all these hoops -- it's a highly organized thing just to meet all the regulatory standards. And so the typical coders and programmers who would normally love to join a Google or a Facebook or whatever, they're never going to join a CGI Federal,\u201d he said.\n\nRoy added that government may be as much to blame as CGI Federal.\n\n\u201cI'm sure CGI Federal didn't do a great job, but they were heavily constrained in terms of what they could do, and a lot of the guidelines that they needed to move forward on the project they didn't get until the last minute,\u201d he said.\n\nA Senate Republican staffer reached by FoxNews.com agreed with that.\n\n\u201cI think one reason they're behind is that the administration didn't issue regulations from between Labor Day and Election Day last fall\u2026 it made things much more complicated for the contractor,\u201d he said.\n\nIn congressional testimony, CGI Federal\u2019s Senior Vice President Cheryl Campbell said that CGI is working hard to make the system better and defended the company\u2019s performance.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, as painful as it sounds -- I know that the experience has been a difficult experience -- the system is working. People are enrolling,\u201d Campbell told Congress in testimony on October 24, and also promised that things would get better.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that there are problems. And we are working together to solve those problems,\u201d she said.\n\nThe author of this piece can be reached at maxim.lott@foxnews.com or on twitter at @maximlott.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata":
