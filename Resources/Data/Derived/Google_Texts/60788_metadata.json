His recent political fame stems largely from a speech he gave at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast, when he stood only a few feet from President Obama and castigated the president\u2019s progressive policies \u2014 including Obamacare.\n\nIt was a performance that endeared Carson to conservatives everywhere \u2013 and made the retired neurosurgeon a possible contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nThat kind of prominence made Obama speech at this year\u2019s prayer breakfast particularly alarming. His dredging up of dustry history \u2014 the Spanish Inquisition and the Crusades \u2014 as some sort of justification for the savagery being committed worldwide by Islamist terrorists in the contemporary world, showed a mindset alien to most Americans, Carson said.\n\n\u201cWell, certainly his words give us some insight into his thinking and his actions or lack thereof, and, you know, there have been atrocities committed throughout human history in the name of religion, and they\u2019re all horrible, and to sit down and try to decide which one is worse than the other, doesn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d Carson said.\n\n\u201cWe should condemn them all, give no quarter to anyone who is involved in such activities, and to try to divert the attention away from the outrage that has been focused on the radical Islamic terrorists, in this manner is rather disingenuous, I\u2019m sure, to say the least.\u201d\n\nBut thanks to the Founders, he said, the United States has a response to \u201cdisingenuous\u201d politicians \u2014 and their followers.\n\n\u201cThe good thing is, we have a system in place that has allowed us to take control. We need to observe carefully what our leaders do and what the people who support them do,\u201d he said. \u201dWe can\u2019t forget who those people are, and we will have another opportunity, coming up in 2016, looking at all the senators and the congressman who rabidly support this man.
