House Bill 4105, scheduled for a vote Tuesday, would bar state or local funds from being used to license same-sex marriages. It would also prevent any state or local governmental employee from granting a marriage license to a same-sex couple, Marbury v. Madison be damned. Basically, no matter how the Supreme Court rules in June, government employees in Texas won't be \"allowed\" to recognize same-sex marriage.\n\n\"This irresponsible and mean-spirited bill doesn't just put Texas on a collision course with a potential Supreme Court ruling,\" Terri Burke, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, said in a statement to Mic. \"Its passage would also bring national condemnation by attempting to lock in discrimination against gay and lesbian couples who simply want to make a lifetime commitment and protect their families the same way everyone else does.\n\n\"It's clear that some of the folks at the Texas Capitol learned little from the way Indiana's lawmakers wrecked their state's national reputation with their own discriminatory legislation this spring.\"\n\nWill it pass? The bill has 89 co-authors, not including Rep. Cecil Bell (R-Magnolia), the bill's primary author. That's well above the simple majority needed to pass the bill through the 150-member chamber and send it to the Texas state Senate, where LGBT activists predict it will easily pass.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "description": "Comparisons to murderers, pornographers and Nazis are just the preamble.", "language": "en", "title": "Texas Republicans Are Going to Insane Lengths to Stop Marriage Equality", "og": {"site_name": "Mic", "description": "Comparisons to murderers, pornographers and Nazis are just the preamble.", "title": "Texas Republicans Are Going to Insane Lengths to Stop Marriage Equality", "url": "https://mic.com/articles/117828/texas-republicans-are-going-to-insane-lengths-to-stop-marriage-equality", "image": "http://thumbs.mic.com/ZDRjZmI1ZjI0YyMvallISWxQSG1MUlRIQU03Q1hnbHBKNGtJSUNnPS8xNngxMTM6MTk3NngxMDYxLzEyMDB4NjMwL2ZpbHRlcnM6cXVhbGl0eSg4NSkvaHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tL3BvbGljeW1pYy1pbWFnZXMvcTlveXlzZ3FjZTR6MG0yczB6YWw2ZGFpZXZiYnRnYXBobHdkMW9vdmh6dHk4bG1sc3Ntd2szdDc4ODlraGo3bS5qcGc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"user_id": 139909832, "description": "Comparisons to murderers, pornographers and Nazis are just the preamble.", "title": "Texas Republicans Are Going to Insane Lengths to Stop Marriage Equality", "url": "https://mic.com/articles/117828/texas-republicans-are-going-to-insane-lengths-to-stop-marriage-equality", "image": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/policymic-images/q9oyysgqce4z0m2s0zal6daievbbtgaphlwd1oovhzty8lmlssmwk3t7889khj7m.jpg", "creator": "ScottBix", "site": "@MicNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Mic", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"pubDate": "2015-05-12T11:45:34.000Z", "isBlacklisted": "false", "modDate": "2015-10-06T04:37:07.000Z", "keywords": "texas, same-sex marriage, supreme court, gay marriage, Politics", "type": "evergreen", "id": 117828}, "fb": {"admins": "23342,215337,1410801,675670245,13000939,616963,1479330109,1267070071", "app_id": 141861192518680}, "msapplication-task": "name=Mic on LinkedIn;action-uri=http://www.linkedin.com/company/policymic;icon-uri=http://linkedin.com/favicon.ico", "original-image": "https://media3.mic.com/YTdiN2QyZjA2OSMvNVctOTFPelRDWllmaVM4ODFhRkxZNU9wQzBjPS8xNngxMTM6MTk3NngxMDYxLzE5MTB4MTAwMC9maWx0ZXJzOnF1YWxpdHkoODUpL2h0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9wb2xpY3ltaWMtaW1hZ2VzL3E5b3l5c2dxY2U0ejBtMnMwemFsNmRhaWV2YmJ0Z2FwaGx3ZDFvb3ZoenR5OGxtbHNzbXdrM3Q3ODg5a2hqN20uanBn.jpg", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MicMedia", "published_time": "2015-05-12T11:45:34.000Z", "modified_time": "2015-10-06T04:37:07.000Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "identifier-URL": "http://mic.com/articles/74689/the-8-most-dysfunctional-families-in-tv-history"}, "article_summary": "Basically, no matter how the Supreme Court rules in June, government employees in Texas won't be \"allowed\" to recognize same-sex marriage.\nSame-sex marriage may have the majority support of the American public, the American judiciary and, in all likelihood, the Supreme Court, but that isn't discouraging anti-equality state legislators from standing athwart history and yelling \"Stop!\"\nThat's well above the simple majority needed to pass the bill through the 150-member chamber and send it to the Texas state Senate, where LGBT activists predict it will easily pass.\nHouse Bill 4105, scheduled for a vote Tuesday, would bar state or local funds from being used to license same-sex marriages.\nIt would also prevent any state or local governmental employee from granting a marriage license to a same-sex couple, Marbury v.
