Fox News Channel’s “The Five” took on the ridiculous statements British comedian Russell Brand made during a recent BBC interview in whicn he called for “a socialist egalitarian system based on the massive redistribution of wealth.”

Greg Gutfeld said that he has the “intellectual capacity of a student” who pontificates in a coffee shop “about issues that have destroyed hundreds of millions of lives.” To him, “it’s only words,” he said.

Kimberly Guilfoyle suggested that “now he doesn’t have Katy Perry, so he’s like a nobody.”

Eric Bolling observed that if Brand is seeking a society based on redistribution of wealth and massive corporate taxation, “Look no further, my man. You’ve found the right place — President Obama and the wizard behind the curtain, Valerie Jarrett.” This characterization set Juan Williams off and the two argued about what America was becoming.

Jedediah Bila suggested that rather than sounding like a student, “he sounds like a college academic. He sounds like every teacher I ever had.” and suggested if he really thinks profits are so evil , “he should give all of his money away — give it to charity.”
