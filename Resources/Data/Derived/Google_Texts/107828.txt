Cats and dogs are adorable to most, but for many watching their little paws sway and tails wag as they jump and play can relax and calm people who become stressed out on airplanes. British Airways has launched its newest form of in-flight Paws & Relax channel based on research that has shown the fuzzy little creatures can calm a nervous flier.

When the company discovered animals can relax a stressed person, they teamed up with Battersea Dogs & Cats Home in London for a photo shoot to promote their new channel, along with the animal rescue foundation. The videos for long flights will feature Simon’s Cat in Pawtrait, the BBC’s The Secret Life of Cats, and America’s Cutest Dog. A few of the pets starred on the channel are homeless pets up for adoption at Battersea, and they include Alfie the Pug, Sky the Siberian Husky, Angelica the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, along with kittens Karma, Knight, and Karis.

“It might sound barking, but there’s lots of research to suggest that watching pets can enhance overall well-being,” Richard D’Cruze, British Airways’ in-flight entertainment manager, told The Telegraph. “We have sniffed out some fantastic content that is cute, comforting and sure to appeal to travelers of all ages.”

Fear of flying is actually a complex psychological issue that could stem from the fear or heights, being over water, fear of the unknown, concerns of terrorist attacks, airline accidents, loss of control, fear of crowded spaces, and a number of other concerns, according to Anxiety and Depression Association of America. The anxiety disorder usually occurs expectantly while the passenger is inflight and panic sets in. Having videos to calm the nerves and distract the individual can help decrease phobia triggers and lessen the person’s overall fear.
