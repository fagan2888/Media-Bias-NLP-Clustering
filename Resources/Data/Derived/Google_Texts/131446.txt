President Obama told a gathering of acolytes in typical arrogant fashion Tuesday that they were doing “God’s work” by enrolling people in Obamacare and supporting his minimum-wage initiative.

At the National Organizing Summit in Washington, D.C., the cleric-in-chief praised the young volunteers for helping register 4 million new Obamacare enrollees, the Washington Examiner reported.

“I could not be prouder of the work you’ve done to help Americans get covered,” Obama said. “We’ve only got a few weeks left. March 31, that’s the last call. If they want health insurance, they need to sign up now.”

The president also urged the 300 young activists in the room to pressure Congress to increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour.

“Let’s get that minimum wage done and give America a raise,” he said.

Still millions away from reaching his unofficial goal of signing up 7 million Obamacare enrollees by March 31, the president blamed the botched rollout and his “implacable opposition” for the slow pace of progress.

But “you’ll see a big push these last few weeks,” he said, according to The Associated Press.

Fox News Special Report panelists Steve Hayes and Charles Krauthammer took issue later Tuesday with Obama’s claim that 4 million have enrolled, noting that only those who had paid their first month’s premiums are truly registered and the “back end” of the HealthCare.gov website is still broken.
