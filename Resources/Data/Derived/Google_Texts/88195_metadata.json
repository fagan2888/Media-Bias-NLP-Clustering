Other soldiers he talked to had been sent there.\n\nHis commanders \u201cdidn\u2019t talk about it, but other soldiers told us about it, primarily paratroopers who had been there,\u201d Alexander said in an interview with The Associated Press, which is not using his surname for his safety.\n\nThe former private first class ended his military service earlier this month. He avoided being sent to Ukraine \u2014 although not without first being threatened with prison for desertion.\n\nHuman rights groups have received dozens of complaints in the past month alone from Russian conscripts like Alexander who say they have been strong-armed or duped into signing contracts with the military to become professional soldiers, after which they were sent to participate in drills in the southern Rostov region.\n\n\u201cWe receive messages from all over in which (soldiers) say that they\u2019re being sent again to Rostov for military exercises,\u201d said Valentina Melnikova, head of the Committee of Soldiers\u2019 Mothers, a group with a three-decade history of working to protect soldiers\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cThose who have been there (to the Rostov region) before know that in actual fact it means Ukraine.\u201d\n\nBecause only contract soldiers can legally be dispatched abroad, worries are spreading among families that inexperienced young conscripts could be sent to fight in eastern Ukraine.\n\nWhile Russia has denied it is sending arms and troops to support the separatists, since the summer dozens of soldiers have been reported killed by explosions during drills in the Rostov region \u2014 deaths that rights groups actually attribute to the conflict over the border in Ukraine. Weapons appear to flow freely across the frontier, and one group of Russian paratroopers was even captured in August, 50 kilometers (30 miles) inside the war zone.\n\nSo far, the Russian government has been able to keep a tight lid on information about any soldiers in eastern Ukraine through a shroud of official denials, harassment of independent reporters who cover the deaths, and carrot-and-stick pressure on the families of those killed. But rising concerns among families with young sons could pose a risk for President Vladimir Putin.\n\nRussia\u2019s secrecy about the soldiers\u2019 deaths has an important precedent: During the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in the 1980s, the government released little information about those killed in the conflict. When the true numbers of casualties became known, the intervention turned unpopular.\n\nMore than 5,600 people have been killed since April in the fighting between Ukrainian troops and the rebels. It is unclear how many Russian soldiers have died in the conflict, as the Defense Ministry has rejected rights groups\u2019 requests on the number of soldiers killed on duty in 2014. But the rising casualty count among Russian soldiers specifically could prove decisive in Putin\u2019s thinking as he comes under pressure to prevent an expansion of the conflict that might put more Russians in the line of fire.\n\n\u201cThis is a conflict that reaches pretty deep into the psyche of the Russian people. It\u2019s not a foreign conflict. \u2026 It\u2019s something very close to home,\u201d said Dmitri Trenin, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment in Moscow. \u201cThis is something that\u2019s at the back of a lot of people\u2019s minds, and in particular, people with sons of draft age are worried.\n\n\u201cMilitary conquest, in my view, would not be supported by the Russian people, and I think everyone knows it,\u201d he added.\n\nIn October, Alexander was preparing to return to his hometown of Inta, a city of 30,000 people that skirts the Arctic Circle, when he and a dozen other recruits were told to report immediately to their base outside of Moscow.\n\n\u201cThey told us: You have to go on a trip,\u201d he said as he wolfed down a full tray of food at the local McDonald\u2019s. \u201cAt first there wasn\u2019t any talk about a contract, but later they said that in order to go on the trip we would have to sign a contract, because we can\u2019t go as conscripts.\u201d\n\nRussia requires almost all young men to serve in the army for one year at age 18, although many find ways to defer or avoid it. Those who want to have careers in the army can become professional soldiers by signing contracts for two or three years.\n\nAlexander and his best friend in the unit both have pregnant girlfriends and had no intention of extending their army service. But they were told that they had already agreed to the trip, and that they couldn\u2019t back out.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to refuse,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they refused our refusal, and we had to go.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Russian conscripts tell of fears of being sent to Ukraine", "author": "Laura Mills", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Russian conscripts tell of fears of being sent to Ukraine", "title": "Russian conscripts tell of fears of being sent to Ukraine", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/21/russian_conscripts_tell_of_fears_of_being_sent_to_ukraine/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/ukraine-russia-soldiers\u2019-fears.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Russian conscripts tell of fears of being sent to Ukraine", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/ukraine-russia-soldiers\u2019-fears.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Russian conscripts tell of fears of being sent to Ukraine", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Russian conscripts tell of fears of being sent to Ukraine", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd05e8\"", "article_summary": "He avoided being sent to Ukraine \u2014 although not without first being threatened with prison for desertion.\nIt is unclear how many Russian soldiers have died in the conflict, as the Defense Ministry has rejected rights groups\u2019 requests on the number of soldiers killed on duty in 2014.\n\u201cMilitary conquest, in my view, would not be supported by the Russian people, and I think everyone knows it,\u201d he added.\nHis commanders \u201cdidn\u2019t talk about it, but other soldiers told us about it, primarily paratroopers who had been there,\u201d Alexander said in an interview with The Associated Press, which is not using his surname for his safety.\nThe 20-year-old knew that meant he might end up fighting alongside pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine."}
