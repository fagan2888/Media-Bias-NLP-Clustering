I\u2019m always listening and looking for what the squirrels and jays are gossiping about, but usually it\u2019s about me. I\u2019ve seen one bear track in 2\u00bd months and heard one bawling out in the woods. I did have a bear in camp one night, although by the time I got out of the sleeping bag, put my headlamp on and unzipped the tent door, that bear was gone.\n\nLions I\u2019ve not seen or heard. Two hikers I talked to saw mountain lions, and both times it was in the Cochetopa Hills. And both times, the cat was lazily stretched out across the trail and took off the minute it became aware of humans.\n\nOne dark and stormy night last week, I was climbing up a ridge through deadfall and thick trees, looking for a place to camp. There hadn\u2019t been a flat space big enough to pitch the tarp for miles, not even a flat-enough spot to stretch out in. If there was nothing down low, I thought, there might be a flat spot up on top, hopefully sheltered by trees.\n\nIt was growing dark, so I put my headlamp on and kept moving. The problem was that I wasn\u2019t moving very well. I had taken a tumble up on Searle Pass a few days before, and everything hurt.\n\nAlthough the rotator cuff in my left shoulder was the big concern, my whole left arm was pretty much useless, and my right shoulder had started acting up as well. Getting my pack on and off had become an ordeal involving tree stumps or boulders for props, rolling around on the ground and, of course, cursing. My ribs ached every time I took a deep breath. My left knee was tweaked in the fall, too. I had to stop and rest often, more often than usual, to hunch over my one hiking pole and take light, non-hurtful breaths.\n\nFinally topping out on the ridge, I saw a nice-looking campsite, but you know how it is: Hey, there may be something better around the next bend. So, I sauntered on down the trail. Then I stopped cold.\n\nI had the weirdest sensation that I was being shadowed. My senses were tingling and the hair on the back of my neck was prickling. There was fresh bear scat full of berries in the trail at my feet, but that didn\u2019t bother me at all. Bears are curious, but black bears aren\u2019t stalkers.\n\nNo. Not a bear. Something else. That was when my mind screamed, Lion! Nothing attracts the attention of a predator like a weak or injured animal. And it was late evening, dinner time. I did a rapid-fire review of everything I knew about a lion confrontation: I couldn\u2019t raise my arms overhead to make myself appear bigger. I couldn\u2019t easily drop my pack and yank out the umbrella, my strongest defense. My Swiss army knife was buried somewhere inside the pack. Running wouldn\u2019t be an option.\n\nNow, the odds of something happening between man and beast on The Colorado Trail are very low, almost nonexistent. To my knowledge, no one has ever been killed or injured or even greatly hassled by any large critter in the whole history of the trail. Nor has anyone been killed by lightning on the trail, and lightning is a real and major danger.\n\nMoose, for me, are the next-most-worrisome thing: Surprising a moose can be a really unfortunate experience. Bears are around, but bears just want you to go away. I\u2019ll bet lots of bears have seen me. Certainly they\u2019ve smelled me. And that\u2019s got to be scary for them.\n\nBut mountain lions have killed people in Colorado and elsewhere. They\u2019re killing machines, and they speak to something deep down and dark in our very core.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be culled from the herd, don\u2019t want to be the first person on The Colorado Trail to go down in that particular record book. I suspect I already hold the longest thru-hiking record. No addendums, please. \u201cOh, old Ghost. Yeah, he was slow. And he got mauled by a lion, too. Perhaps he should have been faster. Tsk, tsk, tsk.\u201d\n\nAs quietly as possible, I began walking backward. When I got to a wide spot in the trail, I whipped around and made my way back to that really great and now very appealing camping spot I had seen. I removed my pack as gently as possible while standing fully upright, no wincing or cursing, then opened it, dug out the tarp and set it up one-handed with much louder banging of rocks against the stakes than usual.\n\nSee here, lion! Man, rock, metal, tool! Then I crawled inside, zippered it up and went to bed without supper.\n\nI didn\u2019t see a lion, but then, mostly, you never do.\n\nI\u2019m asked often if I get scared walking alone on The Colorado Trail. I have to say, that was the scariest experience I\u2019ve had. And I never saw anything tangible to fear. For the most part, I don\u2019t think about everything that can go wrong on the trail, because lots can go wrong and we can\u2019t do anything about the majority of it. If you think about everything that can go wrong, and what there is to be afraid of, you won\u2019t ever take a step.\n\nThe most dangerous things in the woods are humans, and the most dangerous things that happen to humans on The Colorado Trail, we do to ourselves. Like running up a pass in the near dark wearing a big pack.\n\nI have bumped into a section hiker who was packing a huge handgun in a shoulder holster. \u201cWhy?\u201d I asked. \u201cFor bears and cats and such,\u201d he said.\n\nPacking a gun on the trail isn\u2019t the answer for me. A gun doesn\u2019t change the fear factor enough to make up for the weight, and when I\u2019m in the woods with a gun, I have an altered attitude. It\u2019s not the mindset I want to be in on the trail. I\u2019m out there as a fellow traveler, a visitor, an observer. I\u2019m out there as a humble pacifist, alert, watchful and respectful.\n\nBut I do carry a big umbrella.\n\nDean Krakel: dkrakel@gmail.com, instagram.com/dkrakel\n\nEditor\u2019s note\n\nFormer Denver Post photo editor Dean Krakel plans to trek the entire Colorado Trail \u2014 566 miles from Durango to Denver, including a new route through the Collegiate Peaks.
