It found that 41 percent are making financial decisions alone, while 42 percent said they viewed themselves as the most financially astute person in their homes and 56 percent said they share equally in financial decisions with a spouse or partner.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago, you wouldn\u2019t have read survey results like these,\u201d said Nell Merlino, director of PersonalBlackbox, a tech company, and former head of Count Me In, a not-for-profit business resource for women. \u201cThis is a marked change, that women feel empowered and in control of their finances.\u201d\n\nRelated: Yellen, Lagarde and a New Era for Women in Finance\n\n\n\nToday, an increasing share of women have business degrees and out-earn their husbands. More women are also choosing to delay or forego having children to stay in the work force, while others are starting their own companies.\n\nStill, evolving gender roles and greater economic clout are changing women\u2019s psyche and fueling positive change. \u201cMore women are feeling confident and comfortable as the CFO of their own lives,\u201d says Elle Kaplan, CEO and founding partner of Lexion Capital Management, a wealth management firm in New York.\n\nBoomer Women Are the Most Confident\n\nWomen\u2019s feelings about money depend largely on their age. Nine in 10 boomer women said they\u2019re primarily or jointly responsible for long-term saving and investment decisions, according to the Ameriprise study.\n\nIn contrast, 42 percent of women ages 35 to 54 have gone through divorce, unemployment, are supporting a child\u2019s college education, and/or have seen a significant decrease in assets in the last five years, compared to 29 percent of older women and 24 percent of young women.\n\nRelated: Millennial Women Don\u2019t Save As Much as Men\n\n\u201cAs women get older and near retirement \u2013 arguably the biggest financial event of their lifetime \u2013 they engage more in their finances,\u201d says Suzanna de Baca, vice president of wealth strategies at Ameriprise. \u201cWhat was most surprising [about the study\u2019s results] is that almost all women are involved in making financial decisions in their households.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no reason for riotous celebration, however.\n\nWomen Are Still Playing Catchup\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled that boomers are growing more confident in managing their money, that they don\u2019t feel like they will be bag ladies, but when will it be true for the larger population of women?\u201d wondered Merlino. \u201cThere are a lot of women who haven\u2019t saved $2. The majority of small business women gross $50,000 or less.\u201d\n\nFive years after the financial crisis, 57 percent of women said they feel more confident when it comes to finance, compared to 71 percent who felt scared or confused in 2008, according to Fidelity Investments\u2019 research. While that is an improvement, women still lag behind men, 65 percent of whom said they feel confident and prepared to tackle money matters.\n\nSome women still fall for the myth that men are better with money. There are also fewer women financial advisers, particularly for the very wealthy.\n\nRelated: Is Betting on Women CEOs a Smart Financial Move?\n\nTo that end, she recommends that women, especially single women, strengthen their financial foundation by concentrating on paying down debt, which is a drag on financial health. Women should also establish a budget and an emergency fund, and save for retirement as soon as possible, since women live longer than men. Working with a financial adviser and developing a financial plan is also a good start.\n\nDespite lingering issues, women are making strides.\n\n\u201cThe Ameriprise study does a good job of helping to spread the word that in many households, women are in charge,\u201d says Charles Tran, founder of CreditDonkey.com, a credit card comparison and financial education website. \u201cSmart companies will start to notice it\u2019s the moms that control the pocketbook. The dad is sometimes just the driver.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\nThis article has been modified to correct Suzanna de Baca's name.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Women have gained confidence about managing their money and are increasingly becoming in control of their finances, according to a recent Ameriprise survey.", "title": "More Women Become Household CFOs", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/23/More-Women-Become-Household-CFOs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07232014_Woman_Dollars_Lasso_Women.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/23/More-Women-Become-Household-CFOs", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07232014_Woman_Dollars_Lasso_Women.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Women have gained confidence about managing their money and are increasingly becoming in control of their finances, according to a recent Ameriprise survey.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd7a4\"", "article_summary": "A recent study by Ameriprise Financial, \u201cWomen and Financial Power,\u201d looked at women ages 25 to 70 with at least $25,000 in investable assets.\n\u201cThis is a marked change, that women feel empowered and in control of their finances.\u201dRelated: Yellen, Lagarde and a New Era for Women in FinanceToday, an increasing share of women have business degrees and out-earn their husbands.\nThere are also fewer women financial advisers, particularly for the very wealthy.\nTo that end, she recommends that women, especially single women, strengthen their financial foundation by concentrating on paying down debt, which is a drag on financial health.\nWomen should also establish a budget and an emergency fund, and save for retirement as soon as possible, since women live longer than men."}
