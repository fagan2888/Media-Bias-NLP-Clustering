Brown signed legislation Oct. 9, that will allow 170,000 undocumented children to smoothly transition from restricted scope Emergency Medi-Cal (the state\u2019s name for Medicaid) to full-scope coverage, by removing barriers to re-applying or re-enrolling. It will also let children with severe and chronic illnesses stay in specialty care.\n\nOnce undocumented children enroll in comprehensive Medi-Cal, they will be able to take advantage of preventive services and not have to wait until a medical emergency to seek care.\n\nEarlier this year, the governor allocated $40 million for health care coverage for undocumented children through the Health for All Kids program initiated by Sen. Ricardo Lara, D-Bell Gardens, while committing an allocation of $132 million for each subsequent year.\n\n\u201cWhen I began the effort to expand health care coverage to undocumented Californians, many people said it couldn\u2019t get done,\u201d Sen. Lara said in a press release. \u201cJust a year later, we are covering all undocumented children, becoming the largest state to do so.\u201d\n\nHe said the victory will send a message across the country \u201cthat says compassion should always trump bigotry when we\u2019re talking about our immigrant population.\u201d Lara noted that President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act excluded undocumented immigrants.\n\nTanya Broder, a staff attorney in the Oakland office of the National Immigration Law Center said she was happy that California took this step.\n\n\u201cI look forward to continuing the conversation about the need to cover everyone in California,\u201d she said.\n\nThat conversation is expected to resume early next year when Lara\u2019s SB 10 bill, aimed at providing health coverage to the state\u2019s 1.5 million or so undocumented adults, will be taken up by the legislature. The bill will provide health care coverage through a capped Medi-Cal enrollment program, and seek a federal waiver so undocumented residents can purchase health insurance on the state\u2019s online marketplace exchange, Covered California, using their own money.\n\nThe other states that currently provide comprehensive health care to children, regardless of their immigration status, are Massachusetts, Illinois, Washington and New York, as well as the District of Columbia.\n\nEarlier this year, Sacramento, Contra Costa, and Monterey counties, along with the County Medical Services Program that serves 35 small and rural counties in California, launched pilot programs to provide limited health benefits to their remaining uninsured, regardless of their immigration status.\n\n\u201cCalifornians increasingly recognize it is more efficient and effective to offer primary, preventive and specialty care on the front end rather than just expensive emergency and episodic care when it may be too late,\u201d observed Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, a statewide health advocacy coalition.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Earlier this year, the governor allocated $40 million for health care coverage for undocumented children through the Health for All Kids program", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Compton Herald", "og": {"site_name": "Compton Herald", "description": "California will be the fifth state to provide comprehensive health care to undocumented children from low-income families", "title": "Brown approves \u2018Health for All Kids\u2019 legislation", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://comptonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/health-for-kids.jpg", "height": 279}, "updated_time": "2015-10-15T11:04:23-07:00", "url": "http://comptonherald.com/brown-approves-health-for-all-kids-legislation/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Earlier this year, the governor allocated $40 million for health care coverage for undocumented children through the Health for All Kids program", "creator": "@comptonherald", "image": {"width": 500, "identifier": "http://i1.wp.com/comptonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/health-for-kids.jpg?fit=500%2C279", "height": 279}, "title": "Brown approves \u2018Health for All Kids\u2019 legislation", "site": "@comptonherald", "widgets": {"link-color": "#000000", "border-color": "#000000"}, "partner": "tfwp", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "msvalidate.01": "07EE39C1A1B5D169FFAA2E59F7054B8B", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thecomptonherald", "section": "California, USA and World", "published_time": "2015-10-12T14:07:24-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-15T11:04:23-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/thecomptonherald"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd21a3\"", "article_summary": "Earlier this year, the governor allocated $40 million for health care coverage for undocumented children through the Health for All Kids program initiated by Sen.
