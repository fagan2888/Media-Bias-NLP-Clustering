For the second year in a row, the game had to be called off because of the weather. The rain couldn't dampen spirits during Mark Harmon's 14th annual celebrity weekend in Oklahoma.

Thousands of dollars are being raised for local organizations thanks to some "celebrity star power." Mark Harmon was back in town for the 14th annual Mark Harmon Celebrity Weekend.

For the second year in a row, the game was called off due to the weather.

Fans showed up to meet the television star and to raise money for 3 local organizations. Anna's House Foundation has been teaming up with the event for 4 year, and has already raised more than $220,000 for its mission.

"We recruit foster families and place children that are in state custody into their homes," said Executive Director Darci Oplotnik, Anna's House Foundation. "Our mission is to develop a community of foster homes in Luther, Oklahoma, and that community will be home for 8 homes and a multi-purpose center."

Oplotnik said money donated will go towards giving foster children safe homes to live in.

Another organization, Sunset, provides therapeutic services for children through horseback riding, and the Oklahoma City Indian Clinic serves more than 5,500 children.

Organizers are hoping to raise $400,000 this year.
