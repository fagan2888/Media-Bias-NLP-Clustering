An editorial that has been reprinted in a couple of press outlets criticizes the Obama administration for offering an insurance program that clearly fell short of the minimum standards of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nDefenders of the administration\u2019s late announcement of the health plan\u2019s noncompliance, three years after the enactment of the ACA, suggested that it might have been difficult for the implementers of health insurance reform to have been on top of everything that the ACA might affect, such as the AmeriCorps health plan. The administration\u2019s broader defense is that the health insurance plan isn\u2019t technically considered health insurance and, moreover, that VISTA workers aren\u2019t technically paid government employees, but rather stipended volunteers. The latter means that the U.S. government views itself under no obligation to provide VISTA workers with ACA-compliant coverage.\n\nHowever, the Corporation for National and Community Service purportedly had been assuring VISTA workers during this three-year period that their coverage worked for ACA purposes. Now, in the wake of the announcement that VISTA workers might be hit with individual coverage penalties due to their lack of adequate coverage, VISTA workers are being encouraged to get coverage on their parents\u2019 health insurance policies or, because of their extraordinarily low incomes, apply for Medicaid coverage.\n\nHowever, an exploration of blogs and listservs frequented by VISTA workers and other AmeriCorps stipended volunteers reveals that the shortcomings of health coverage for VISTAs was a well known source of problems in the program for some years, even before the advent of the ACA:\n\nDescribing the \u201cmediocre\u201d aspects of AmeriCorps service, one volunteer wrote, \u201cYou can receive health insurance, which works well for simple visits to Target Clinic and is great for prescriptions but anything serious or that requires hospital stays requires that you call them to discuss it.\u201d\n\nAnother was a bit more blunt: \u201cThe big drawbacks, no sugar-coating\u2026the \u2018health insurance\u2019 is bullshit.\u201d A second-year AmeriCorps participant was equally blunt: \u201cYour medical/dental benefits will suck. They are very basic\u2014very. And you are encouraged to get supplemental insurance during your service. I have many examples, both personal and co-worker based, on the level of suckage of the benefits.\u201d\n\nIn most cases, the negative comments about AmeriCorps healthcare came from AmeriCorps participants who were otherwise supportive of the work they were doing in the field and recommending that others join them. For example:\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say that if you are still under your parents health insurance and know that the organization is reputable and that there will be other VISTAs there, go for it. It really can be rewarding if you find the right place\u2026 The real complaint I have is the health coverage. I now have some debt from a medical visit that I was told was covered but because the doctor did NOT do a certain test, it was not covered. As someone pointed out, the prescription coverage is fantastic.\u201d\n\nIn many cases, health coverage is the only complaint: \u201cIf there\u2019s anything to complain about regarding the program, it would be the lack of a decent health insurance policy. What [the plan administrator] Seven Corners offers is just terrible.\u201d\n\nWhile AmeriCorps volunteers, including VISTAs, will sometimes complain about the incredibly low compensation, the lack of unemployment insurance coverage after they leave (because they aren\u2019t government employees), and other factors, most didn\u2019t join the program blind. The VISTA program was always one which closely fit the description President Lyndon Johnson gave the nation\u2019s first group of 20 VISTA volunteers: \u201cYour pay will be low; the conditions of your labor often will be difficult,\u201d he said, \u201cBut you will have the satisfaction of leading a great national effort and you will have the ultimate reward which comes to those who serve their fellow man.\u201d\n\nBut healthcare is different. Like Medicaid and Medicare, both products of the War on Poverty that gave birth to the VISTA program itself, the ACA is a program that reflects a national commitment that every American, no matter what his or her circumstances, should have health insurance coverage. Low, poverty-level wages are not an excuse for the nation to put these social action volunteers into lifelong debt due to medical costs, whether preexisting conditions, not covered by their AmeriCorps insurance, or specialty treatments. This healthcare coverage snafu is particularly ironic, as many AmeriCorps volunteers are working in programs aiming to extend access to healthcare for people in need.\n\nAccording to the editorial, \u201cAmeriCorps needs to update its current health benefit to ensure it meets minimum coverage requirements in the reform law\u2026Obama has been a staunch supporter of national service, and he should shelter volunteers from any penalties until this is sorted out.\u201d It adds, \u201cAmericans who have dedicated themselves to serving their country in a federal volunteer program should not be caught in the cross hairs of the federal health reform law.\u201d\u2014Rick Cohen\n\nKEYWORDS:", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to an editorial in the Des Moines Register talking about the AmeriCorps VISTA program, \u201cAmericans who have dedicated themselves to serving their country in a federal volunteer program should not be caught in the crosshairs of the federal health reform law.\u201d", "original-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2014/01/10/americorps-healthcare-insurance-coverage-should-be-fixed/", "og": {"site_name": "Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly", "description": "According to an editorial in the Des Moines Register talking about the AmeriCorps VISTA program, \u201cAmericans who have dedicated themselves to serving their country in a federal volunteer program should not be caught in the crosshairs of the federal health reform law.\u201d", "title": "AmeriCorps Healthcare Insurance Coverage Should Be Fixed", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2014/01/AmeriCorps.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-16T16:06:50+00:00", "url": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2014/01/10/americorps-healthcare-insurance-coverage-should-be-fixed/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2014/01/AmeriCorps.jpg", "description": "According to an editorial in the Des Moines Register talking about the AmeriCorps VISTA program, \u201cAmericans who have dedicated themselves to serving their country in a federal volunteer program should not be caught in the crosshairs of the federal health reform law.\u201d", "site": "@npquarterly", "card": "summary", "title": "AmeriCorps Healthcare Insurance Coverage Should Be Fixed - Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly"}, "syndication-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2014/01/10/americorps-healthcare-insurance-coverage-should-be-fixed/", "article": {"section": "News", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2014-01-10T15:07:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-16T16:06:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Policy, Healthcare, Volunteerism, White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3f0\"", "article_summary": "This healthcare coverage snafu is particularly ironic, as many AmeriCorps volunteers are working in programs aiming to extend access to healthcare for people in need.\nIt really can be rewarding if you find the right place\u2026 The real complaint I have is the health coverage.\nJanuary 2, 2014; Des Moines RegisterThe press coverage about the shortcomings of healthcare insurance for AmeriCorps VISTA workers has been a little sparse beyond the New York Times and the Nonprofit Quarterly.\nThe administration\u2019s broader defense is that the health insurance plan isn\u2019t technically considered health insurance and, moreover, that VISTA workers aren\u2019t technically paid government employees, but rather stipended volunteers.\nThe latter means that the U.S. government views itself under no obligation to provide VISTA workers with ACA-compliant coverage."}
