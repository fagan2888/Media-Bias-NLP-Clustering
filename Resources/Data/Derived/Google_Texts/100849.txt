AUSTIN, Texas â€” The man police say killed two people when he smashed his car through a barrier and into a street thronged with attendees of the South By Southwest festival has been charged with capital murder.

A district judge Friday set bail for Rashad Charjuan Owens at $3 million. He remains jailed.

The 21-year-old from Killeen, Texas, faces one capital murder charge, though more charges can be added later.

Police say an officer tried to stop Owens on suspicion of drunken driving around 12:30 a.m. Thursday, but he drove into the crowd while attempting to flee.

An Austin woman and a man from the Netherlands were killed. Twenty-three others were injured. Owens was treated for minor injuries but remained in police custody the entire time.
