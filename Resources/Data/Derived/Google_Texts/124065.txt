I'm excited to announce the launch this morning of our annual Cutest Baby Contest!

This year, it comes to you thanks to our great sponsors - Midwifery at Women's Health Alliance, which offers midwifery care for expecting moms and women planning on becoming pregnant, and Storybook Theater, which offers fantastic theater for kids at the Duke Energy Center for Performing Arts in Raleigh.

The contest, as usual, offers grand prizes and prizes for the runners-up in two categories - 0 to 12 months and 13 months to 24 months. Our sponsors are providing gift cards for the winners. And Marbles Kids Museum, Be True Image Design photography studio and Nuvonivo, the Raleigh children's boutique, also are adding some great prizes!

There are two ways to enter - through Go Ask Mom's Facebook page or through WRAL.com.

Follow one of those links for all of the contest rules and details! Can't wait to see all these cuties!
