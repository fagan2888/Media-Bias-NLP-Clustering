He\u2019s normalized relations with Cuba, implemented a historic Iranian nuclear deal, signed a global climate pact with nearly 200 nations, overseen the continued success of Obamacare, all while the economy has recorded 73 straight months of job growth.\n\nNo wonder that polls point toward a Democrat succeeding him in the White House.\n\nSo why isn\u2019t there more media credit directed his way? Is the press making the mistake of reading off the Republican campaign script this year, which insists America is teetering on collapse? (Obama joked at the White House Correspondents Dinner: \u201cThe end of the Republic has never looked better.\u201d)\n\nWhatever the reasons, let\u2019s note there hasn\u2019t been a media rush to document Obama\u2019s strong standing in recent weeks. CNN last month timidly suggested, \u201cthere\u2019s some evidence that the public is viewing Obama \u2026 more fondly.\u201d The first clue? Obama\u2019s approval rating hit a three-year high of 53 percent, according to Gallup. (He boasts a staggering 66 percent approval rating today among voters 18-29.)\n\nObama\u2019s strong showing has remained steady since March: Gallup on Monday pegged his approval rating at 52 percent.\n\nNote that the president\u2019s approval rating dropped down to 40 percent just 18 months ago during the midterm election cycle in 2014, which means he\u2019s ridden a 13-point surge over the last year-and-a-half. Doesn\u2019t that qualify as news?\n\nThe president averaged a nearly 50 percent approval rating from January 20 through April 19, his 29th quarter in office, according to Gallup. That 29th quarter represents \u201cone of the higher quarterly averages in his presidency to date.\u201d That\u2019s especially remarkable considering second terms are not traditionally kind to presidential approval ratings.\n\nRecall that our previous two-term president left office with a 22 percent approval rating, while his vice president signed off with a thumbs-up from 13 percent of voters.\n\nWhat\u2019s also impressive is that in today\u2019s hyper-partisan environment, Obama has been able to boost his standing while getting almost no support from Republican voters.\n\n\u201cObama is the first president since polls existed to have never gone above 25 percent approval from the other side,\u201d noted Paul Waldman at the American Prospect. Obama\u2019s approval among Republicans currently stands at just 14 percent, according to Gallup. Given today\u2019s rugged political terrain, \u201cIf a president can stay at 50 percent, he should be counted a remarkable success,\u201d Waldman argued.\n\nBut don\u2019t look for lots of media tributes. The truth is, during his two terms the press has repeatedly worked todepict Obama\u2019s standing as being on the decline, and often downplaying his success. (Also, good news is no news.) As Media Matters noted in 2010, \u201cBeltway scribes today have made it plain that when it comes to Obama and polling, good news is no news.\u201d\n\nAnd when Obama\u2019s standing did fall, the press eagerly piled on, as I laid out after Democratic losses in 2014:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president's approval rating just hit a three-year high.
