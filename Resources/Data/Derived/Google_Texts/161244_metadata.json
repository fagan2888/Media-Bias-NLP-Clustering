Alas, the Grand Serpent\u2019s claim to that dubious paternity has long since been challenged by more fertile and febrile monsters, among which louche set none can claim first rank with more authority than the tongue-torquing, lip-biting prevaricators of modern politics.\n\nAs for old Nick, when he was Lie-Master-in-Chief, He at least was clear on one thing: That a lie was, indeed, a lie. Not even in the broiling stews of Hell would He have tried to imply otherwise. He treasured His lying, tied it in fact to matters of apocalyptic consequence: the loss eternal of souls and endless perdition and pain. But not even Nicky had the brass to claim a lie as truth, or a lie as a disguised virtue. That was left to the PR-bred, spin doctor-massaged politicians of our sad and weary day.\n\nLet us take the case of the great duplicitist himself, the Master, William Jefferson Clinton, a man who looked warily upon truth as the grease on the pole of his ambition. He knew it was an easier mast to climb when it had been studded with something more abrasive, when it had been gritted and rutted with evasions, equivocations, infinite parsing and jesuitical conjugations of the obvious. He splintered the pole with each evasion, scarred it with chop logic, and carved whole footholds with artful deceit.\n\nAnd subtle, too, he could be. \u201cThat depends on what the meaning of is is\u201d is his most famous slip-slide into swampy semantics. Not many politicians can claim to have taken the wind of out the most fundamental verb in human history.\n\nRarely has a lie, a straightforward brass-faced lie, been launched with such fulsome bravado, unshaven of all qualifications whatsoever\n\nMr. Clinton\u2019s most brass-faced lie, his Thermopylae stand against the truth and all its attendant soldiery, is now famous. People who cannot house a line of Lincoln in their iPhone brains store Clinton\u2019s famed animadversion and denial, the immortal: \u201cI did not have sex with that woman \u2026 er \u2026 Ms. Lewinsky. \u201c\n\nHe spoke this locus classicus of determined deceit, which at the time was hysterical in its rebuttal of reality. For at the moment the words were uttered he was living a White House sex fantasy in real time, featuring under-the-desk carnal ministrations from his intern-houri while he whispered diplomatic sweet-nothings to some foreign ambassador. History\u2019s first t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate.\n\nClinton\u2019s nose-telescoping gobsmacker was spoken with gritted teeth, live, into the eyes of a camera and watched by every American citizen. Rarely has a lie, a straightforward brass-faced lie, been launched with such fulsome bravado, unshaven of all qualifications whatsoever.\n\nSkip now to the current incumbent, the supercool master of the outright, non-subtle, brazen, full-on, deliberate lie. He sold the transformation of 20% of the American economy, the upheaval of its health-care system, and the launch of the error-riddled and Byzantine (the law is more than 20,000 pages long, with more to come) Obamacare.\n\nRelated\n\n\u201cIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. If you like your health-care plan you can keep your health-care plan. Period.\u201d Those are Obama\u2019s straightforward, urgently stated declarations \u2014 repeated on tape to audiences of thousands and on television to audiences of millions. The \u201cperiod\u201d was his anchor of assurance. No way you couldn\u2019t keep your plan or your doctor. Period.\n\nAs millions of Americans now know, of course, those were lies. And they were lies when they were made. The most central persuasion to have Americans vote or buy into Obamacare was a declaration from the herald of a new politics, of truth and transparency such as America had never seen, from the mouth of the angel of Hope and Change \u2026 all of it a damn lie.\n\nIt was not a Clinton sex lie, a lie to excuse hormonal recreation, or fraternizing sexually with the White House help. This was a policy lie, from a man who came into the White House as a symbol of a new day in politics, a turning away from the mud and madness of Washington. But \u201cyou can keep your doctor, you can keep your plan\u201d was a deceit that would have shamed Nixon. Obama, the winged messenger of a new day, turns out to be as loose with the truth, and as comfortable with casting it aside, as the most pot-bellied, cigar-chomping ward-healer of old.\n\nOf these two, who lied least? I give Clinton a slight moral edge. He can plead his overactive sex drive, and he confined his lies to matters that (mainly) concerned him and Hillary and Monica. Obama\u2019s, however, is far more serious. He was a president speaking as a president. He was changing the law. He was giving eye-to-camera assurances to Mr. and Mrs. America, and knew those assurances were false.\n\nObama wins the lie tournament with the Clinton. But he was aided by a mindset. Obama is a progressive politician. He went to Harvard. He knows more than anybody else \u2014 and especially all those millions less intelligent than he \u2014 what is good for them. So with the smug, righteous and callous authority of the progressive, he was more than prepared to deceive those who elected him \u2026 and place his head on a soft pillow each night with the soothing thought, that \u2014 after all \u2014 he was lying to them for their own good.\n\nAnd who could know better than them what they really wanted but he himself?\n\nNational Post", "article_metadata": {"description": "Clinton, at least, merely sought to cover up his own sex drive.
