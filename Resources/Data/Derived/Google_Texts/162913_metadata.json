You\u2019d rather binge-watch just about anything Netflix has to offer?\n\nI feel ya, as the kids say, especially as there\u2019s a good chance that none of the major cuts Republicans call for in their budget will be passed by Congress this year, let alone signed by President Obama.\n\nAnd yet, this is an important piece of work, especially in an election year. The proposals described below represent the consensus blueprint for the budget policies of today\u2019s Republican Party. Should the presidency change parties next year, these ideas could represent the point of departure for a dramatic transformation of the role of government, particularly as it relates to the least advantaged, in ways that would intensify hardship for tens of millions of Americans.\n\nLet me show you what I mean:\n\n\u2014 Loss of health insurance coverage: The Republican budget would, of course, repeal Obamacare \u2014 and, thus, the Medicaid expansion. It would then convert Medicaid into a block grant (a fixed funding amount to states), disabling the problem\u2019s ability to ramp up in recession. The budget would also end subsidies to those who\u2019ve recently been able to afford private health coverage. The result would be loss of coverage for tens of millions of Americans and a sharp reversal of a great national achievement from 2014: the decline in the rate of uninsured from 13.3 percent to 10.4 percent, the largest such decline on record.\n\n\u2014 Underfunded public goods: Funding for non-defense discretionary programs, which include education, scientific research, infrastructure, national parks and forests, law enforcement, courts, and other national needs, is already slated to reach a historic low in 2018. The House Republican budget would further cut spending in these areas by about $1 trillion over the next decade.\n\n\u2014 Environmental and economic exploitation: The House Republicans would get rid of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and roll back most of the financial regulation passed in response to the \u201cinnovations\u201d that brought us the housing bubble. It would then gut both the budget and regulatory capability of the Environmental Protection Agency, inhibiting its ability to fight global warming.\n\n\u2014 Greater poverty: All told, under this budget, roughly 40 percent of current federal resources to help low-income households would be gone by 2026. Moreover, though conservative rhetoric argues for devolving federal functions down to the state level, House Republicans have also begun pushing for the repeal of the Social Services Block Grant \u2014 which \u201cprovides states with $1.7 billion a year to meet the needs of their most vulnerable populations, primarily vulnerable children, seniors, and people with disabilities\u201d \u2014 and an anti-immigrant change to the Child Tax Credit that would deprive millions of kids (about 80 percent of whom are U.S. citizens) of much-needed income.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re really into budget wonkery, you might have noticed that the official analysts of such proposals at the Congressional Budget Office provide a rosier review of the House budget resolution than the one I just gave you. CBO finds that the proposal significantly reduces the deficit and debt, and, in doing so, unleashes stronger income growth than it otherwise expects to occur.\n\nIn fact, that would be a highly unlikely outcome, as it\u2019s based on implausible assumptions. To be very clear, it is not CBO\u2019s fault for accepting those assumptions. They must plug in the assumptions they\u2019re given. So when House R\u2019s say that although they\u2019re cutting a bunch of taxes for high-earners and multinational corporations and will somehow make up the lost revenue by closing unspecified loopholes, CBO has no choice but to believe them.\n\nBecause of assumed revenue neutrality, the large spending cuts lower the deficit and debt. Next, CBO assumes that lower debt will deliver lower interest rates and less crowding out of more productive private borrowing by government borrowing. So the plan gets credit for leading to faster GDP, wage and income growth.\n\nConsider the links in this chain. First, this group that has sworn in blood oaths never to raise taxes is supposed to somehow claw back the revenue they cut though raising tax payments somewhere else in the code (just don\u2019t ask where). Next, while I see no evidence that our current debt levels are crowding out private borrowing and pressuring interest rates, lower debt is supposed to have the positive macro effects CBO assumes (meanwhile, all those cuts to infrastructure, research and education do no harm to growth, of course). Then, despite our high levels of income inequality, the benefits of this new growth are supposed to flow to middle-income and poor people.\n\nBut here\u2019s the clincher. Even if this magic occurred, most people would still be worse off, because the spending cuts to the programs on which they depend would more than offset their income gains.\n\nOne more point. I called this a \u201cconsensus blueprint\u201d for Republican fiscal policy above, but that\u2019s not quite right. A minority of House Republicans refuse to support their colleagues\u2019 budget resolution. That\u2019s not, of course, because they share my concerns. It\u2019s because it doesn\u2019t go far enough in cutting spending outside of defense.\n\nSo as much as I\u2019d love to ignore this mishegoss, I\u2019m afraid we cannot afford to do so. We must view this budget blueprint as a potential path that\u2019s out there, depending on the outcome of the election. There are a lot of people whose well-being depends on this path not being taken.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Though this budget won't become law, it cannot be ignored in an election year.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Though this budget won't become law, it cannot be ignored in an election year.", "title": "Why we can\u2019t ignore the House Republicans\u2019 really bad budget", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/03/21/why-we-cant-ignore-the-house-republicans-really-bad-budget/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/02/17/Local-Politics/Images/Congress_Snow-06b96-1116.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@econjared"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/03/21/why-we-cant-ignore-the-house-republicans-really-bad-budget/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "budget, Republican, taxes, poverty, spending, discretionary", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "budget, Republican, taxes, poverty, spending, discretionary"}, "article_summary": "The House Republican budget would further cut spending in these areas by about $1 trillion over the next decade.\nNow, if you\u2019re really into budget wonkery, you might have noticed that the official analysts of such proposals at the Congressional Budget Office provide a rosier review of the House budget resolution than the one I just gave you.\nA minority of House Republicans refuse to support their colleagues\u2019 budget resolution.\nLet me show you what I mean:\u2014 Loss of health insurance coverage: The Republican budget would, of course, repeal Obamacare \u2014 and, thus, the Medicaid expansion.\nNext, CBO assumes that lower debt will deliver lower interest rates and less crowding out of more productive private borrowing by government borrowing."}
