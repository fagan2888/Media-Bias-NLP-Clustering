Bush and Dick Cheney ran the American empire, and their functional equivalents, the humanitarian interventionists who have taken charge under Barack Obama, twaddle on, at opportune moments, about American exceptionalism.\n\nIt is one of those expressions, like \u201cthe American dream,\u201d that have no fixed meaning, only vague connotations, but that are sometimes useful in political contexts.\n\nFollowing the dubious lead of Ronald Reagan\u2019s speechwriters, contemporary exponents of the idea moralize the concept. For them, American exceptionalism means American moral superiority.\n\nThis understanding is ideologically pernicious, philosophically incoherent, and preposterous on its face. But it does serve a purpose.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s September 24 address to the United Nations General Assembly exemplified the idea\u2019s flaws and its uses in a perspicuous way.\n\nIt is too bad that this speech, and the self-righteous saber rattling about Syria that preceded it, have already fallen into the great American memory hole. Had their fifteen minutes of news cycle fame lasted longer, the ludicrousness of Obama\u2019s contentions might have become too obvious for even our base and servile media to ignore or deny.\n\nBut Tea Party acting out put the kibosh on that prospect. In a display of mindless obstinacy extreme even for them, they decided to shut the government down unless Obama would give in on funding the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).\n\nThe focus of the news cycle therefore shifted away from Obama\u2019s feeble efforts to justify American bellicosity to divisions within the Republican Party, and to the mean-spiritedness and imbecility of the Tea Partiers who now run the show.\n\nThis development would not have been all bad, had the corporate media made plain how the reform Republicans now recklessly oppose is essentially a Republican plan \u2013 forged in the early 90s at the Heritage Foundation as an alternative to Hillarycare, and implemented, just a few years ago, in Massachusetts under then Governor Mitt Romney.\n\nBut that would be too much to expect from them; and indeed, it never came to pass. Instead, Obama\u2019s proclamation of America\u2019s probity emerged unscathed.\n\nAnd so, a moralized understanding of American exceptionalism is still very much in the public arena, and still doing harm.\n\nIt is therefore all but certain that the next time a new military adventure in the Middle East or elsewhere beckons, the neocon-humanitarian interventionist twaddle will resume.\n\nTaking exception to it is therefore still timely and, the media\u2019s attention notwithstanding, as urgent now as it was just a few days ago.\n\n* * *\n\nWhat Obama said in defense of the idea was more than usually slippery \u2013 in part because he implicitly conflated America\u2019s exceptionalism with his own.\n\nThis rhetorical slight of hand has become familiar in the Age of Obama.\n\nObama uses it, for example, to counter growing popular discontent with the surveillance state he actively superintends.\n\nEdward Snowden\u2019s revelations have brought the Bush-Obama war on centuries old protections against state interferences with individuals\u2019 lives and behaviors into public awareness. But not to worry! Obama will see to it that only good will come from what the NSA and the others do. How could it be otherwise? His moral superiority is beyond reproach; it is exceptional.\n\nTherefore even as his administration trashes privacy rights and Constitutional guarantees of due process, this President, Constitutional scholar extraordinaire, along with Attorney General Eric Holder and the surveillance state\u2019s lesser minions, can be trusted implicitly.\n\nThey will do the right thing not just because they are good, but because they are so good that they needn\u2019t abide by rules that constrain others; they are too exceptional for that.\n\nSimilarly, in foreign affairs, President Drone wants to be free to kill and maim as he pleases. And so he asks for unstinting trust \u2013 on the grounds that America is and always has been the world\u2019s best and most consistent guarantor of freedom and justice.\n\nAt the UN, he said, in effect, that America is not just one state among many; its essential goodness puts it in a category by itself.\n\nNo matter that in the real world the United States, especially (but not only) after World War II, has been, by far, the main perpetrator of violence and reaction throughout the world, and the main prop for some of the most vicious dictatorships known to humankind.\n\nWhat matters is that, even when we make mistakes, we are essentially good. This is why the world should acknowledge that a pax Americana is our planet\u2019s best hope.\n\nObama told the world leaders attending his speech that the peoples of the world already know this in their hearts. The problem is just that some of them are in the thrall of ideologies that preach otherwise \u2014 and therefore don\u2019t know that they know.\n\n\u201cAnti-American\u201d ideologies are always at the ready. Communism is gone and secular nationalism is on the wane. But Islamism has arisen to fill the void. The Leader of the Free World knows this well. Since the late 1970s, American governments have been doing their best to stoke the flames.\n\nAn so it is that, just as, in the memorable words of the late (and unlamented) Leona Helmsley, taxes are only for the \u201clittle people,\u201d international law is for lesser \u2013 unexceptional \u2013 states only.\n\nBeing exceptional, America can make whatever exceptions to international law it pleases \u2013 not because it can, but because it is good. This is true now more than ever because now America is led by someone obviously trustworthy and wise \u2014 a Nobel laureate, no less.\n\nThe same holds, in diminished degree, for countries that participate in America\u2019s essential goodness \u2013 Israel, of course, and the UK and sometimes Germany and France along with other obedient, EU countries.\n\nOn the other hand, lesser states and peoples, the unexceptional ones, must follow the rules \u2013 without exception. When they don\u2019t, or when Obama thinks they don\u2019t, they can rightfully be beaten into submission by any means necessary and suitable to the exigencies of electoral politics in the United States.\n\nIn other words, at the UN, Obama did more than merely flaunt the \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card that American presidents have always wielded. He tried to justify deploying it at his pleasure.\n\nNeedless to say, few in attendance that day were impressed by the cogency of the case Obama made. They are not fools. They know that, in the arena of world politics, naked power, whenever it feels compelled to justify itself, does so by appealing to high and noble purposes; it always has. In this respect, America is no exception.\n\nBut it is different from most because the humanitarian interveners now calling the shots probably are sincere or, what comes to the same thing, exceptionally (unusually) uncynical in their attempts at self-justification.\n\nDo Susan Rice and Samantha Power \u2013or, for that matter, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama \u2013 believe the nonsense they spout? Terrifying as the prospect may be, this seems to be the case.\n\nPerhaps their sincerity makes them less odious ethically than some of their counterparts in other times and places. But, for reasons that Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli long ago made clear, in the realm of Realpolitik, cynicism can be and often is a virtue, and sincerity a vice. If Obama understands this, there is no sign of it.\n\nPerhaps the Obama of old, the one who had yet to enter into national politics, understood; we know that he was at least exposed to the arguments. Evidently, years spent stewarding world capitalism are not just morally degrading; they are intellectually debilitating as well.\n\nThe problem with a moralized understanding of American exceptionalism is not only that its factual basis is glaringly \u2013 preposterously \u2013 wrong. The idea is philosophically incoherent.\n\nThe reason why, in short, is that morality admits of no exceptions.\n\nLet us say that an ethic provides an account of how a person ought to act; and that morality designates a kind of ethic \u2013 one that holds that, in pertinent circumstances, one should act (and deliberate) from an impartial or agent-neutral point of view.\n\nThat idea is basic to modern understandings of justice and right; but even at the dawn of the modern era, it was not a new idea. It is anticipated in the ethical theories of many of the world\u2019s religious traditions.\n\nThe Golden Rule is an example. To do unto others as you would have others do unto you implies that, from the point of view in question, the moral point of view, what distinguishes oneself from others is of no account; that, for purposes of determining what one ought to do, only what one has in common with other persons matters.\n\nThe moral point of view is assumed in most strains of ethical theory. However it has also been subjected to trenchant criticism.\n\nKarl Marx was a critic, though his concerns had to do with real world applications of the moral point of view in class divided societies, not with the soundness of the idea itself.\n\nMarx thought that an ideal society \u2013 the (small-c) communism towards which history was moving \u2014 would genuinely institutionalize the moral equality of persons. But this side of communism, where class struggle is the rule, institutionalized morality sometimes functions as a snare and illusion that reinforces existing systems of class domination.\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche was a more radical critic; he took issue with the very notion of equality that the moral point of view supposes and therefore with the idea of morality itself.\n\nIn pressing his case, he made use of notions of virtue and of inherent differences among human beings that have roots in the ethical traditions of Greek and Roman antiquity and in the thinking of other \u201cheroic\u201d civilizations.\n\nProponents of American exceptionalism, like Barack Obama, are, to a man and woman, defenders of the class divisions Marx abhorred; and they can hardly be accused of harboring sympathies for the kind of ethical thinking Nietzsche advanced.\n\nIf called to explain their stance, they would surely reject notions of inherent gradations of goodness in persons \u2013 or nations.\n\nThis is why, at the UN, Obama took care to base his assertion of American moral superiority on America\u2019s good deeds on the world stage and on its many sacrifices of blood and treasure.\n\nNo matter, again, that the purported goodness of those deeds is a plain confabulation. No matter either that the U.S. came out rather well from World War II in contrast to other belligerents, or that the burdens most Americans have born in the cause of American world domination are trivial in comparison to those America has unleashed on the nations and peoples it dominates.\n\nTo be sure, the (mainly) economic conscripts our chicken hawk leaders persist in putting in harm\u2019s way have suffered mightily. Many of them have been driven to despair or even suicide \u2013 not to defend their nation, but to implement neoconservative and humanitarian interventionist folly. But their travails pass unnoticed to the vast majority of Americans who bear no sacrifices at all.\n\nIn short, the facts are overwhelmingly not on Obama\u2019s side. But even if they were, it would hardly matter because there is no such thing as moral capital \u2014 except in the propaganda mills of states intent on justifying their oppression of others by appealing to historical events of the near or distant past.\n\nThus by declaring itself \u201cthe state of the Jewish people,\u201d Israel claims a right to do as it pleases to Palestinians or anyone else in its way \u2013 because of what the Nazis did to European Jews more than a half-century ago. Sometimes it is even suggested that victimhood is essentially part of the Jewish condition, and that this somehow frees Israel from the usual norms of international conduct.\n\nAt least the Israelis can mount a spurious case in defense of that contention; that Obama would even suggest anything similar for the United States defies credulity.\n\nBut even if there were a case to be made, it would be irrelevant.\n\nThere is no way to argue for exceptions to the requirements of morality by appealing to the exceptional morality of those for whom the exceptions are claimed. The very idea is self-contradictory.\n\n* * *\n\nThe neoconservative-humanitarian interventionist purchase on American exceptionalism also comes with a lineage that conflicts with the drift of the political line its proponents nowadays advance.\n\nFor them, American exceptionalism is a tool in global capitalism\u2019s arsenal. It was not always so.\n\nAs remarked, the turning point came during the Reagan presidency. It was a by-product of an ideological blitz that drew substantially on Anglo-Protestant, especially Puritan, theology, and on related political currents that had lain dormant for two centuries or more.\n\nReagan\u2019s reference to \u201cthe shining city on the hill,\u201d at the 1984 Republican Convention, is a well-known example.\n\nThe more or less intended effect of this way of presenting America\u2019s role in the world is to move the discussion onto a quasi-theological plane \u2014 depicting America\u2019s essential goodness as a transcendent property of the state.\n\nNeedless to say, this is not the way the effort is usually described. If it were, its ludicrousness would be too apparent to bear even casual scrutiny.\n\nThe effect is similar to what has been achieved by calling the Nazi led effort to exterminate European Jewry a \u201cHolocaust.\u201d The biblical reference suggests that ordinary causal explanations cannot explain what happened; that the evil lies outside the scope of ordinary human understanding.\n\nThis is nonsense, of course, but at least, in that case, there was a genuine and profound evil to explain. In declarations of America\u2019s essential goodness in world affairs, there is nothing to account for \u2013 naturalistically, theologically or in any other way. There is no there there.\n\nThis is not to say that talk of American exceptionalism is necessarily pernicious. Before the Reaganite turn, before the expression and the concept it articulates were construed in a moralized way, \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d was a benign and sometimes useful notion.\n\nThe idea goes back at least to Alexis de Tocqueville\u2019s account of American democracy in the late 1830s. Tocqueville deemed America qualitatively different from the countries of the Old World; in this way, it was \u201cexceptional.\u201d\n\nThe differences, he thought, were striking enough to call for a fresh understanding of historical trajectories and democratic forms. The absence of a feudal past figured importantly in Tocqueville\u2019s discussion, as did other ostensibly unique features of the American situation.\n\nDecades later, a number of historians \u2014 Charles Beard and Frederick Jackson Turner, among others \u2013 were struck by the feebleness of the socialist movement in the United States. In this respect, the United States seemed qualitatively different from contemporaneous industrialized societies. This exception to the rule likewise called for an explanation.\n\nTo account for this American exceptionalism, they made much of the fact that, up to their time, there had always been a frontier ready to absorb people whose discontents might otherwise have taken a less exceptional turn. Other pertinent factors included levels of immigration that gave rise to animosities that blocked the formation of social solidarities; and, of course, there was the race question, as there always is.\n\nOn the whole, these pre-Reagan invocations of the term, and more often of the concept associated with it, came from the Left. In the late 1920s, there was even a Communist version of American exceptionalism, associated with Jay Lovestone, a leader of the American Communist Party.\n\nLovestone thought that America\u2019s industrial power and seemingly unlimited resources exempted it from the usual \u201claws of development\u201d of capitalist societies. Stalin promptly quashed that heresy; and, by the 1930s, the idea was heard no more in Communist circles.\n\nThus it has only been in the past several decades that \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d has changed sides; that the idea has been invoked to justify according carte blanche to American governments to do as they please.\n\nThe appropriation of the idea within liberal-imperialist ranks is newer still. Its roots go back barely two decades \u2013 to ill-informed reactions to events in Bosnia and Rwanda. The prominence this way of thinking now enjoys is, for the most part, a creature of Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\n* * *\n\nThe questions that first raised the idea of American exceptionalism remain pertinent and, to some extent, unresolved. But in view of what has happened to the term in the current period, it is perhaps best that it be retired.\n\nIn its moralized sense, American exceptionalism is a noxious doctrine. Reduced to its core, it amounts to nothing more than an expression of raw power \u2013 one that puts the United States beyond legal or customary constraints, that gives it license to do what it wants because it can.\n\nThis was probably not what Obama had in mind by the slogan \u201cyes, we can.\u201d It is certainly not what his supporters thought he meant. But it is what his foreign and military policies amount to. Notwithstanding all the blather \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d has elicited of late, there is nothing more to it than that.\n\nANDREW LEVINE is a Senior Scholar at the Institute for Policy Studies, the author most recently of THE AMERICAN IDEOLOGY (Routledge) and POLITICAL KEY WORDS (Blackwell) as well as of many other books and articles in political philosophy.
