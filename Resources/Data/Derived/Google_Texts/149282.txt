To the Editor:

“Guantánamo Is Leaving Obama With Choices, Neither of Them Simple” (news article, Nov. 1) is wrong to imply that President Obama has only two choices: fail to close Guantánamo or do so by violating congressional restrictions on transfers of detainees.

Among other measures, he could instruct the Justice Department to concede that release is appropriate in habeas corpus cases brought by the 53 detainees who are already cleared for transfer by unanimous consent of the intelligence agencies, the military, and the Justice and State Departments. Doing so would allow their release within the terms of the same statute that supposedly renders closure impossible.

The president could also defeat the ban on transfers by doing what the article notes Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the secretary of state, sensibly suggested years ago: negotiating guilty pleas with some of the remaining detainees in federal court. Guilty pleas would present an opportunity for the courts to rule that the existing transfer restrictions were not intended by Congress to apply to such cases.

To the Editor:

President Obama’s much-publicized agonizing over whether to “shutter” Guantánamo is a smokescreen. At best, he plans to close the physical facility and transfer its prisoners elsewhere. That will not fulfill his promise to restore the rule of law.

Guantánamo will not be closed in any meaningful sense until the president repudiates his assertion of the unconstitutional power to detain forever without trial prisoners whom the executive does not find convenient to release.
