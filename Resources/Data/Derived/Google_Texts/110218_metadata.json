The designations will last for a decade so it\u2019s much too early to gauge the long-term viability of the program, but with 15 more zones in the pipeline, supporters and critics alike are paying close attention for signs of success or failure.\n\nThe Promise Zones will rely on a mixture of public and private capital, and one early wrinkle involves the enactment of tax incentives designed to spur investment and hiring. Outgoing Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan has warned that the initiative can\u2019t reach its full potential without the tax breaks.\n\nThe administration identified two tax breaks in its Fiscal Year 2015 Revenue Proposal that it wants to see passed: an employment credit for businesses that hire zone residents, and the enactment of bonus depreciation for property used as part of an investment in the designated Promise Zone areas and their eligible surroundings.\n\nObama has more than 18 months left in office to guide the tax credits to fruition. But unfortunately this will require an act of legislation from a Congress increasingly disinclined to support any program that could make the President look good.\n\nAt a recent event on the Promise Zones sponsored by the Center for American Progress, Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said the administration is holding out hope the program\u2019s legacy will involve congressional action, but she acknowledged the political difficulties involved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in an environment where we get receptivity to anything that comes out of an administration official\u2019s mouth, least of all the President\u2019s,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is not a partisan thing. We\u2019re in a conversation that\u2019s being led by folks on both sides of the aisle \u2026 and this is a proposal that frankly draws heavily from ideas that have been put forth from both sides of the aisle.\u201d\n\nIndeed, tax breaks are a cornerstone of GOP economic policy \u2014 and parts of the Promise Zone program are remarkably similar to the \u201cEconomic Freedom Zones\u201d envisioned by Sen. Rand Paul. But that won\u2019t necessarily shield the proposal from pushback from members of the GOP\u2019s Tea Party wing. Sen. Ted Cruz has already used the Promise Zone announcement as an opportunity to rail against the Affordable Care Act and call for abolishing the IRS.\n\nStill others have expressed concerns that concentrated investments of private capital in the nation\u2019s most vulnerable neighborhoods could lead to accelerated gentrification and could actually displace poor residents.\n\nSome residents of Philadelphia\u2019s Promise Zone, which centers on the neighborhood of Mantua, have echoed those concerns. At the recent \u201cFuneral for a Home\u201d event \u2014 which memorialized the demolition of an abandoned Mantua rowhome \u2014 Rev. Harry Moore lamented the gradual encroachment of the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University into the community, and other attendees said they have already seen signs of gentrification.\n\nBut Mantua is also a neighborhood with a strong community identity and a history of joining ranks against outside threats. Home to the legendary grassroots anti-drug crusader Herman Wrice, who died in 2000 \u2014 and, more recently, groups like the People\u2019s Emergency Center and Rick Young\u2019s Mantua Community Improvement Committee \u2014 the neighborhood has long confronted the realities of crime, decay and a lack of opportunity with a deeply ingrained culture of residential activism.\n\nEva Gladstein, executive director of the Mayor\u2019s Office of Community Empowerment & Opportunity, which is tasked with overseeing the implementation of Philadelphia\u2019s Promise Zone program, says this makes Mantua fertile ground to capitalize on the program.\n\n\u201cA lot of work has been going on here with support from institutions like Drexel University and local resident groups. So there\u2019s a strong community planning network already in place,\u201d she said. \u201cAt this point the Promised Zone is really about aligning these resources, so to the extent there was already things going on, it\u2019s really about having a shared commitment among all these distinct agencies.\u201d\n\nIn her early work to get the initiative off the ground, Gladstein has set about parlaying these existing community initiatives into broad-based community revitalization. To this end, she says much of the past five months has been dedicated to getting the right people at the table.\n\nOn May 28th, OCEO hosted its fifth Shared Prosperity community roundtable, which brought together roughly 60 stakeholders and residents, together with representatives from city and federal government, to share ideas and pinpoint opportunities for greater collaboration.\n\n\u201cThis is the start of a long-needed conversation about the Promise Zone,\u201d DeWayne Drummond, a president of the civic association, told a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s a step up on climbing this ladder we\u2019ve got to climb.\u201d\n\nTo date, OCEO has organized six committees to examine goals and objectives based on work that has been going on in the community and to identify early action items. And Mantua is already the beneficiary of two competitive federal grants under the Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative totaling $850,000. Gladstein says work is under way to use that money to increase access to early childhood learning, and improve public safety through strategies such as improved lighting, the rational deployment of officers, and training residents in crime prevention.\n\nMeanwhile new applications have been filed and are pending for funding for programs to reduce teen pregnancy, help working mothers with infants, provide job training for ex-offenders and increase early childhood literacy.\n\nGladstein says the city has also provided $645,000 in matching funds to apply for a grant from the Corporation for National and Community Service. CNCS provides money for organizations committed to strengthening their communities through volunteering, and it has already made a commitment to provide five full-time AmeriCorps VISTA members to each Promise Zone.\n\nSign-up for our newsletters Sign Up Daily Weekly", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obama administration\u2019s Promise Zone in Philadelphia has made progress, but the program also faces local and national challenges.", "og": {"url": "https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/philadelphia-promise-zones-obama-success", "image": "https://nextcity.org/images/daily/_resized/Philly_FuneralForHome_1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Obama administration\u2019s Promise Zone in Philadelphia has made progress, but the program also faces local and national challenges.", "title": "From Progress to Problems, a Close-Up on One Obama Promise Zone"}, "twitter": {"domain": "nextcity.org", "description": "The Obama administration\u2019s Promise Zone in Philadelphia has made progress, but the program also faces local and national challenges.", "title": "From Progress to Problems, a Close-Up on One Obama Promise Zone", "image": {"src": "https://nextcity.org/images/daily/_resized/Philly_FuneralForHome_1.jpg"}, "creator": "@NextCityOrg", "site": "@NextCityOrg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 310796842303514}, "thumbnail": "https://nextcity.org/images/daily/_resized/Philly_FuneralForHome_1.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde2be\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is the start of a long-needed conversation about the Promise Zone,\u201d DeWayne Drummond, a president of the civic association, told a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter.\nSen.
