Paul Ryan may have achieved his goal of getting government moving again, but now he's raised the ire of conservatives within his party over the more than $1 trillion tax and spending measures passed Dec. 18, 2015.\n\n\n\nAs a result, Ryan may be facing a primary challenge from the right for the 1st Congressional District seat.\n\n\n\nMike Zoril of Beloit announced on his Facebook page on Christmas eve that he may mount a primary challenge to the Speaker.\n\n\n\nZoril said that he receives enough support, he's \"in it to win it.\"\n\n\n\nZoril, a Republican activist, is chairman of Beloit's Equal Opportunities commission. He attempted a run for Beloit City Council last spring but failed to gain a spot on the ballot because he didn't have enough valid nomination signatures.\n\n\n\nZoril changed the name of his Facebook page Dec. 24 to \"About Primary Challenge Paul Ryan - Republican Mike Zoril for Wisconsin Congress.\"\n\n\n\nHe describes himself in the about section as Christian and very conservative.\n\n\n\nRyan, of Janesville, was named speaker of the House in October, and since then spent his time finalizing a deal that would fund the government and avoid a shutdown similar to 2013.\n\n\n\nEver since the House and Senate passed a tax package and $1.1 trillion spending plan, Ryan has been defending the plan to conservatives within the Republican party.\n\n\n\nThe deal made permanent a series of tax cuts as well as removing a decades old ban on exporting domestic oil.\n\n\n\nHowever it included $700 billion in unpaid tax cuts, although Ryan maintains it simply keeps in place already approved tax measures.\n\n\n\nConservatives seem most upset that the deal included neither a defunding measure for Planned Parenthood nor a repeal of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nRyan said the House will pass a measure including both when it returns in January, and send it to the presidents desk.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama likely will veto the measure, but in an interview with CSI Media last week, Ryan indicated he thought there was a chance for a veto override.\n\n\n\nRyan also will face at least one Democrat in the fall 2016 election.\n\n\n\nTom Breu of Janesville quit his job in October at the Wisconsin Banking Commission as a consumer credit examiner to devote himself full time to his campaign.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 669, "identifier": "http://www.gazettextra.com/storyimage/JG/20151228/WC/151229802/EP/1/1/EP-151229802.jpg", "height": 1000}}, "twitter": {"description": "The latest news from Walworth County Today.", "title": "Beloit Republican considers primary run at Ryan", "url": "http://www.walworthcountytoday.com/20151228/beloit_republican_considers_primary_run_at_ryan", "image": "http://www.gazettextra.com/storyimage/JG/20151228/WC/151229802/EP/1/1/EP-151229802.jpg", "site": "@walcotoday", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Zoril changed the name of his Facebook page Dec. 24 to \"About Primary Challenge Paul Ryan - Republican Mike Zoril for Wisconsin Congress.\"\nAs a result, Ryan may be facing a primary challenge from the right for the 1st Congressional District seat.\nMike Zoril of Beloit announced on his Facebook page on Christmas eve that he may mount a primary challenge to the Speaker.\nBeloit Republican considers primary run at RyanMike ZorilBELOIT -- Rep.
