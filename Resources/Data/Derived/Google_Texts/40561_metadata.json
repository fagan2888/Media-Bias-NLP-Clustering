Snowden pointed to journalists' enhanced ability to tell stories about the practice that has significantly spiked since the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks.\n\n\"For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already accomplished,\" he said. \"I already won.\"\n\nAt his year-end press conference on Friday, President Barack Obama was asked how he would react to Americans agreeing that Snowden \"set in motion something that is proper and just.\" With Snowden under indictment, Obama acknowledged that he had \"to be careful\" with his comments. But the president did say that he believed \"this is an important conversation that we needed to have.\"\n\n\"I have also said before that the way in which these disclosures happened have been -- have been damaging to the United States and damaging to our intelligence capabilities,\" Obama added. \"And I think that there was a way for us to have this conversation without that damage.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost: Edward Snowden Edward Snowden\n\n1 of 7 Edward Snowden This June 9, 2013, file photo provided by The Guardian in London shows Edward Snowden, who worked as a contract employee for the National Security Agency, in Hong Kong.
