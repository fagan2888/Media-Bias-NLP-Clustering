It’s possible the world has its eye on the wrong ball when it comes to Iran. Last month, Iranian television released footage of a missile from below the surface of the water, courtesy of the naval wing of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guard Corps.

The missile that theoretically could have been launched from a submerged submarine was show on Iranian television during the “Great Prophet 9” exercise that was held on February 25-27. IRGC naval commander Rear Admiral Ali Fadavi said in a subsequent television interview, "I believe that this weapon is a strategic weapon. It has special characteristics,"

Jane’s Defense Weekly, the British bible on all international defense weapons, reported, that Fadavi was coy when asked for more details. He wouldn’t confirm that the missile was launched from a submarine and said, "I would like to keep this information for the future. It is a very special weapon and the Americans cannot even surmise how strong and effective this weapon is."
