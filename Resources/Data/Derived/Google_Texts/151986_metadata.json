Lindsey Graham of South Carolina offered the fiercest attack of the night on Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhile he didn\u2019t actually answer the question he was being asked\u2014which was how Americans could become less reliant on government assistance\u2014Graham showed an extraordinary understanding of what the 2016 election is actually about: Whether or not a Republican will undo Barack Obama\u2019s agenda of his past two presidential terms, or whether a Democrat (likely Hillary) will keep that status quo in place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cTo all the Americans who want a better life, don\u2019t vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Graham said. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to repeal Obamacare and replace it, I will. She\u2019s not going to build the Keystone pipeline, I will. She\u2019s not going to change Dodd-Frank, I will.\u201d\n\nThe tone of Graham\u2019s remarks was odd, making it sound like he was already in a one-on-one contest with Clinton, when he is actually near the very bottom of the crowded Republican field. But the actual substance for what he was saying describes incredibly well what is at stake in the 2016 election. Because the size of the current GOP House majority is so large, it is unlikely that Clinton would be able to take back the Congress even if she (or another Democrat) were to win the presidency.\n\nThat means that any agenda Clinton wanted to enact would likely face the same firewall of opposition in Congress that Obama\u2019s agenda has faced since the Republicans took back control of the House in 2010. So what\u2019s really being fought over is whether or not a Republican president, House, and Senate undo Obama\u2019s domestic and foreign policy achievements, or a Democratic president preserves them.\n\n\u201cUntil you change the policies of Barack Obama, we\u2019re never going to grow this economy. Until you change the policies of Barack Obama, we\u2019re never going to be safe,\u201d Graham continued. \u201cShe represents a third term of a failed presidency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just domestic policy changes, like repealing the Affordable Care Act or pushing through the Keystone XL pipeline over the objections of environmentalists that Graham promised to change. In terms of American security, Graham is one of the most vocal opponents of Obama\u2019s Iran deal, and he emphasized that America\u2019s foreign policy would be a lot different under a Republican president. Responding to an earlier question in the debate about whether or not former New York Gov. George Pataki would \u201cput a mosque under surveillance,\u201d Graham was adamant that, yes, he would if need be. He also seemed to say that he would be willing to send American troops into combat \u201cto protect us here,\u201d while Clinton wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIf I have to send more American troops to protect us here, I will do it,\u201d Graham said. \u201cShe will not.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear where Graham wanted to send troops, but he was one of the most bellicose voices at a recent hearing about the Iran deal, berating Defense Secretary Ashton Carter with repeated questions about \u201cwho wins the war between us and Iran\u201d and declaring \u201cWe win!\u201d\n\nObama has said that the choice in his Iran deal is one between peace and war, and it is widely opposed in the Republican field, including by Graham.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhich is part of the problem for Graham with his attack on Clinton. Sure, he would do all the things that he described, and Clinton would not. But so would every single other GOP candidate. He offered no distinguishing feature between himself and the entire rest of the field, the vast majority of which he trails.\n\nPerhaps the only way that he stood out is that he showed himself willing and ready to link Bill Clinton\u2019s 1990s prevarication about sex scandals to Hillary Clinton being less than 100 percent forthright about the personal email account she used while serving as secretary of state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fluent in Clinton-speak, I\u2019ve been dealing with this crowd for 20 years. You know when Bill Clinton says, \u2018it depends on what the meaning of is is\u2019 that means is is whatever Bill wants it to mean,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen Hillary Clinton tells you \u2018I\u2019ve given you all the emails you need,\u2019 that means she hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nUpdate, August 6, 2015, 8:10 p.m.: A spokesperson from the pro-Clinton rapid response group Correct the Record went after Graham following the debate.\n\n\"If Lindsey Graham wants to resort to desperate, junior league attacks against Hillary Clinton, maybe he really does belong on the junior league debate stage,\u201d Mary Jennings, the deputy communications director for Correct the Record, wrote in an email to Slate. \u201cBaseless attacks aren't going to get him any traction in the polls or differentiate him from any of the other bottom-tier hopefuls.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "You should actually pay attention to this if you want to know what the 2016 election is about.", "sailthru.author": "Jeremy Stahl", "description": "About midway through Thursday\u2019s early Fox News GOP debate for second-tier 2016 Republican primary candidates, Sen.
