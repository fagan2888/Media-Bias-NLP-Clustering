When is a PLHP most likely to spur growth? Could an alternative form of administrative infrastructure benefit a PLHP? What can be gained through granular analytics?\n\nProviders need to understand consumers\u2019 price and benefit preferences, the firm said. For example, data show people who purchase their own health insurance favor low-cost \u2014 though not necessarily the lowest-cost \u2014 plans. They also are willing to pay for convenience, to let their records be shared between providers and payers, and want to be able to access their information using technology.\n\nChoosing the right market is also important. Regions where the health system has a large footprint and where insurer consolidation is low offer the best chances for growth through a PLHP.\n\nWhile many of the earliest PLHPs targeted the Medicaid market, more recent ones are offering Medicate Advantage and public exchange plans. With the shuttering of 12 of the 23 exchange co-ops, health systems can expect more Obamacare enrollees to be looking for health plans. Recent losses by some major payers, such as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, could cause them to also exit the exchanges \u2014 creating a need that PLHPs could fill.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nMcKinsey&Company: The market evolution of provider-led health plans", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Meg Bryant", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/63/97/639778f9ab23147199b752913fc94b41.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-payer,healthcare-hospital-admin", "news_keywords": "Payer,Hospital Administration,Hospital Admin", "category": "News Post", "title": "Thinking of starting a provider-led health plan?
