It\u2019s enough to allow him to control the airwaves until November\u2019s election.\n\nHis Democratic rival, Wendy Davis, has $13.1 million in the bank, helped largely by party loyalists, women\u2019s groups and entertainment figures.\n\nUnlike federal campaigns, Texas does not restrict the size of individual donations. Critics of the state\u2019s unlimited system say it means those with deep pockets are trying to buy insider access. Donors dispute that, saying they line up behind the candidates who best represent their values.\n\nHere\u2019s a deeper look at the Abbott-Davis fundraising over the last year:\n\nTOP DONORS, ABBOTT\n\nHarold Simmons, $900,000\n\nA Dallas billionaire and philanthropist, Simmons was one of the most prolific donors to conservative causes until his death in December.

He founded Kinder Morgan, one of the largest energy companies in America.\n\nAbbott\u2019s big-name backers\n\nNew York billionaire Donald Trump, $35,000\n\nActor Chuck Norris and his wife, Gena, $15,000\n\nFormer Dallas Cowboy Troy Aikman, $10,000\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee\u2019s political action committee, $1,000\n\nFormer GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin\u2019s PAC, $5,000\n\nOther notable contributions\n\nGambling interests have given at least $450,000 to Abbott, including a combined $99,500 from the Chickasaw and Choctaw nations in Oklahoma and $254,000 from restaurateur and Golden Nugget casino owner Tilman Fertitta.\n\nTOP DONORS, DAVIS\n\nBattleground Texas, $1.5 million\n\nThis represents in-kind contributions, such as staff time and rent. Former operatives for President Barack Obama founded the group, whose voter registration and turnout drives benefit Davis and other Texas Democrats.\n\nCarolyn Oliver, $1 million\n\nOliver is an Austin doctor and philanthropist who also gave $1 million to Battleground Texas.\n\nMostyn Law Firm, $837,000\n\nSteve Mostyn is a wealthy Houston trial lawyer who specializes in hurricane-damage suits.

Angle. It compiles opposition research on GOP candidates.\n\nDavis\u2019 big-name backers\n\nDirector Steven Spielberg and his wife, actress Kate Capshaw, $25,000\n\nFilm producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife, Marilyn, $25,000\n\nActress Jennifer Garner, $25,000\n\nSinger James Taylor, $15,000\n\nActor Matt Damon, $5,000\n\nActress Marlo Thomas, $5,000\n\nActor Leonard Nimoy and his wife, Susan, $1,250\n\nTennis legend Martina Navratilova, $1,000\n\nSinger Barbra Streisand, $1,000\n\nActress Carrie Fisher, $1,000\n\nActress Elisabeth Shue, $1,000\n\nDirector Judd Apatow, $1,000\n\nActor Tom Hanks, $250\n\nOther notable contributions\n\nDavis got $200,000 from Walter Umphrey of Beaumont and his law firm.
