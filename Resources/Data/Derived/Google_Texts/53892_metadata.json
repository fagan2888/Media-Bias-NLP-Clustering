It's been four years since her last album came out, and she picks up exactly where she left off on songs like \"The Fear\" and \"Smile.\" From the looks of it, she's just as outspoken as ever. Fetters: Whoa. Whoa, whoa. There\u2019s so much going on here! What all is she parodying? I think by my count we\u2019ve got the Three-6 Mafia track, with the title; the Robin Thicke \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d video, with the glossy balloon letters spelling out a PSA about the star\u2019s body parts; and, like, every mid-2000s rap video ever, with the cash flying around and the champagne being poured all over / licked off of both probable and improbable surfaces. I\u2019m sure I missed other stuff, too. But beyond being hilarious it\u2019s also kind of important, right? I think I like where she\u2019s going with this: flipping the \u2018Hard Out Here for a Pimp\u2019 idea and making it about the ugly pressure for women to be hot glamazons or virgins or happy homemakers or some combination of those. \u201cIt\u2019s unfair and unrealistic to expect women to look and behave in this certain way\u201d is a pretty familiar message, obviously, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s one that\u2019s worth hearing often.\n\nFeeney: That\u2019s what I was wondering about, too. There\u2019s nothing particularly new about Allen\u2019s message here. Christina Aguilera and Lil\u2019 Kim confronted double standards about women in pop and hip-hop a decade ago. Missy Elliott tried to flip the word \u201cbitch\u201d in the \u201890s. But in the wake of Robin Thicke and Miley Cyrus this year, it seems like conversations about who or what gets to control, police, or empower female sexuality are especially relevant. While I\u2019m truly thrilled that Allen is back, though\u2014especially since so many pop-diva albums of late have been underwhelming\u2014and while she\u2019s the perfect one to tackle these topics, I think parts of this video aren\u2019t as mind-blowingly progressive as some make them out to be. For me, it\u2019s sometimes hard to tell whom she\u2019s aiming at in the video: The men responsible for enforcing such expectations about women\u2019s bodies, or the women who go along with them? Both? Related Story A Chat About Why Kanye West Acts That Way Fetters: I guess the villain in the scenario is this old white guy who\u2019s trying to whip her into celebrity shape\u2014so by that logic, maybe it\u2019s the establishment that\u2019s enforcing norms like these that she\u2019s pointing a finger at. What strikes me as sort of weird is that the expectation to be gorgeous and submissive and sexually inviting doesn\u2019t seem to be uncomfortable or limiting to any of the women except Lily Allen. The rest of them don\u2019t seem to hate being in these constricting costumes or doing these generally unnatural things except for her\u2014and as a result, if you listened to this on mute, you might think this is less like a parody of the way we look at women in music videos and more like Allen poking fun at herself for not being able to live up to this standard the rest of the women apparently do. At the end of the video, there\u2019s a shot of Allen falling out of her sexy pose and looking exasperated; if that were a shot of all the women falling out of their sexy poses, blowing their cheeks out like Allen does, taking out their heavy, uncomfortable earrings, or taking their heels off or something, then I feel like we\u2019d get a better picture of the idea that these are three-dimensional women getting forced into this unfair, one-dimensional expectation for what women should be. But as it stands, Allen is the only three-dimensional woman in this video.\n\nFeeney: Exactly! If I remember correctly, Lily Allen is a pretty clever and self-aware pop star, and it\u2019s obvious from the balloons and the product placement that she knows exactly what conversations about pop music she\u2019s parachuting into. But while she tries to point her finger at exactly how ridiculous and troubling it is when, say, Miley Cyrus, surrounds herself with black back-up dancers to sexualize herself and seem more exotic, it doesn\u2019t ever seem like Allen really practices the sort of solidarity she preaches. I get that when she rips off the black body cloth and starts dancing, she\u2019s positioning herself as one of them. We\u2019re all in it together! \u201cIt\u2019s hard out here for bitches like us!\u201d But even when she\u2019s dancing with them, it seems she\u2019s still kind of making fun of them, or at least keeping her distance. Unlike Allen, they never stop playing up the bottle-popping, booty-shaking roles they\u2019ve been assigned\u2014roles she\u2019s already condemned and rejected. For a song that deals with reclaiming ownership of your own body, she seems to be the only one that gets to do so. Fetters: I\u2019m glad you bring up the Miley Cyrus thing, actually, because obviously a huge part of that conversation was the race appropriation. Do you feel weird about the racial aspect of this Lily Allen video? I feel not-so-vaguely icky about it. Most of these bodies getting ogled at and over-the-top objectified are black women\u2019s bodies, and the woman rejecting that, presenting herself as the exception, is white. Feeney: I definitely noticed it. Considering so much of this video is a parody\u2014and the song itself is, too, given the Auto-Tune, I think\u2014I hope that what you identified is Allen failing to make her point about black women in videos as effectively as she could have, not completely missing the point altogether. Her intent to call out people like Miley Cyrus is obvious, even if there\u2019s not a total rejection of what her villainous manager would like to see happen on set. It\u2019s also worth bringing up Lorde here, too. One critique of \u201cRoyals\u201d\u2014and to a similar degree, Macklemore\u2019s \u201cThrift Shop,\u201d with all the crusades against materialism\u2014is that it, in the words of Spin, \u201cinvade[s] rap and R&B playlists while simultaneously lecturing black artists.\u201d (Emphasis their own.) In Lily\u2019s case, it\u2019s hard for me to accept her call to stand up against industry forces that celebrate material excess and limited expressions of sexuality when there\u2019s a little bit of a holier-than-thou attitude coming through. It's hard for me to accept her call to stand up against industry forces when there\u2019s a little bit of a holier-than-thou attitude coming through. Which I guess brings me back to my first reaction to the video: It seems to echo something Rashida Jones said on Twitter last month. Jones called out celebrities for \u201cacting like whores\u201d and showing too much skin, and, while I love Rashida Jones, it made me cringe a little. The critiques of her comments that captured my feelings best were the ones that quoted Tina Fey from Mean Girls: \"[Women] have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores. It just makes it okay for guys to call you sluts and whores.\u201d And, ultimately, Lily acknowledges the problem is the skeezeball industry gatekeepers who get to ask questions like, \u201cHow does somebody let themselves get like this?\" in reference to pregnancy weight. But I didn\u2019t get the impression she\u2019s refrained from judging women who choose to shake their butt or show some skin.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A chat about the singer&#39;s comeback single and its brutal, if imperfect, parody of the year&#39;s biggest pop songs", "author": "Nolan Feeney and Ashley Fetters", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "A chat about the singer&#39;s comeback single and its brutal, if imperfect, parody of the year&#39;s biggest pop songs", "title": "Is Lily Allen's New Music Video as Progressive as the Internet Says?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/11/thisone/lead_large.png", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/is-lily-allens-new-music-video-as-progressive-as-the-internet-says/281409/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Do you feel weird about the racial aspect of this Lily Allen video?\nFeeney: Lily Allen is back!\nIf I remember correctly, Lily Allen is a pretty clever and self-aware pop star, and it\u2019s obvious from the balloons and the product placement that she knows exactly what conversations about pop music she\u2019s parachuting into.\nWhat strikes me as sort of weird is that the expectation to be gorgeous and submissive and sexually inviting doesn\u2019t seem to be uncomfortable or limiting to any of the women except Lily Allen.\nBut I didn\u2019t get the impression she\u2019s refrained from judging women who choose to shake their butt or show some skin."}
