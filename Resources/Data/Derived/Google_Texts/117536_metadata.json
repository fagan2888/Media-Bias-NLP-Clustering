(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nThe number of people shopping for medical insurance on the Spanish-language version of HealthCare.gov is lagging behind last year's interest, even as the Obama administration urges Hispanics to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFederal figures released Wednesday show that about 153,000 people used cuidadodesalud.gov during the first three weeks of the current enrollment season for ACA health plans, down from 244,000 during the same period a year ago.\n\nThe enrollment snapshot for the week ending Nov. 21 also indicates that the federal insurance exchange continues to have greater difficulty in attracting new customers than last fall. Overall, the 1.6 million people who have chosen new health plans so far exceeds the comparable number from 2014. But 35 percent of them are newcomers, down from 48 percent at this point a year ago. That equates to 576,000 newcomers who have selected health plans \u2013 nearly 90,000 fewer than last year.\n\nThe latest snapshot, part of a weekly series being issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, provides an early view of the 2016 ACA enrollment period. The three-month season began Nov. 1 and continues through January, but people who want coverage when the new year begins must sign up by Dec. 15. Current customers who have not chosen a health plan by then will be automatically renewed in the same plan \u2013 or a similar one if theirs will not continue. Federal officials have cautioned that customers could face sticker shock if they do not shop for the most economical plan available in their area for the coming year.\n\n[Rate hikes widespread for popular HealthCare.gov insurance]\n\nThe decline in use of the Spanish-language version of the online exchange system comes despite federal outreach efforts focusing on 10.5 million uninsured residents who are eligible for coverage under the health-care law. Hispanics make up a disproportionate share of this targeted population, and the administration is targeting its marketing and outreach efforts in several areas, including communities in Florida and Texas with large Hispanic populations.\n\nACA ads intended to persuade Hispanics to sign up for coverage are being aired in both Spanish and English, in part because recent research has shown that many prefer English.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell has predicted that reaching new customers will be more difficult this enrollment season. Eligible people who are still uninsured have already ignored or rejected two previous opportunities to buy coverage through the marketplaces created under the health-care law.\n\nAnd while the penalty for remaining uninsured will become stiffer next year -- $695 per person, or 2.5 percent of income, whichever is greater -- HHS is predicting that the number of people paying for ACA health plans will increase only marginally to about 10 million by the end of 2016.\n\nRead more:\n\nUnited HealthGroup says it is scaling back efforts in ACA exchanges\n\nKentucky's newly insured worry about their health under next governor\n\nIn chilling accounts, Paris doctors tell of war-like effort to save hundreds of wounded after attacks\n\nModern men tend to overeat like cavemen as a way of showing off to women\n\nCutting sugar from kids\u2019 diets appears to have a beneficial effect in just 10 days\n\nFor more health news, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The latest open-enrollment numbers signal how tough a challenge the Obama administration faces in getting more Hispanics to sign up.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The latest open-enrollment numbers signal how tough a challenge the Obama administration faces in getting more Hispanics to sign up.", "title": "Little headway in attracting more Hispanics to ACA health coverage", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/11/25/little-headway-in-attracting-more-hispanics-to-aca-health-coverage/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/11/09/Editorial-Opinion/Images/495382804-1543.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@goldsteinamy"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/11/25/little-headway-in-attracting-more-hispanics-to-aca-health-coverage/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "ACA, health coverage, insurance, Latinos, Obama administration", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "ACA, health coverage, insurance, Latinos, Obama administration"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3543\"", "article_summary": "Antonio Galis, an insurance agent from Sunshine Life and Health Advisors in Florida, goes over available health insurance plans with a client earlier this month.\nOverall, the 1.6 million people who have chosen new health plans so far exceeds the comparable number from 2014.\nThat equates to 576,000 newcomers who have selected health plans \u2013 nearly 90,000 fewer than last year.\nFederal figures released Wednesday show that about 153,000 people used cuidadodesalud.gov during the first three weeks of the current enrollment season for ACA health plans, down from 244,000 during the same period a year ago.\nThe latest snapshot, part of a weekly series being issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, provides an early view of the 2016 ACA enrollment period."}
