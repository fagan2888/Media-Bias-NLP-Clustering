(O\u2019Malley prefers the term new American.)\n\n\u201cWell, I voted numerous times when I was a Senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in,\u201d Clinton told the audience. \u201cAnd I do think you have to control your borders.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s use of the phrase illegal immigrants prompted quick backlash among liberals who believe it is an offensive term to describe immigrants, including Jose Antonio Vargas and other activists.\n\nClinton went on to say it is \u201cunnecessarily provocative\u201d to claim to want to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, as Republican candidates like Donald Trump have called for. She said, \u201cWe need to secure our borders, I\u2019m for it, I voted for it, I believe in it, and we also need to deal with the families, the workers who are here, who have made contributions, and their children.\u201d\n\nSome immigration activists said that Clinton appeared to overemphasize the importance of securing the border, a talking point among conservatives that also was a central element in a bipartisan immigration bill in the Senate.\n\nClinton has called for comprehensive immigration reform and said she would go further than President Obama in protecting undocumented immigrants from deportation. She also said in the first Democratic debate that she is in favor of allowing undocumented immigrants to purchase plans under Obamacare, but was not in favor of giving undocumented immigrants subsidies.\n\nO\u2019Malley has released a detailed immigration plan and said he would give Obamacare subsidies to undocumented immigrants. As Maryland governor, he moved to give undocumented immigrants access to in-state tuition at the University of Maryland, a measure he supports nationally.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ex-Maryland governor Martin O'Malley attacked Hillary Clinton on Thursday for using the term \"illegal immigrants\" instead of \"undocumented\"", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "The former Maryland governor prefers the term \"new American\"", "title": "O'Malley Hits Clinton for Saying 'Illegal Immigrants'", "url": "http://time.com/4111176/martin-omalley-hillary-clinton-illegal-immigrants/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/martin-o_malley1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/martin-o_malley1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "The former Maryland governor prefers the term \"new American\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "O'Malley Hits Clinton for Saying 'Illegal Immigrants'"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "2016 election, hillary clinton", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Martin O'Malley, immigration reform, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Clinton immigration, hillary clinton illegal immigrants"}, "article_summary": "She also said in the first Democratic debate that she is in favor of allowing undocumented immigrants to purchase plans under Obamacare, but was not in favor of giving undocumented immigrants subsidies.\nO\u2019Malley has released a detailed immigration plan and said he would give Obamacare subsidies to undocumented immigrants.\nClinton has called for comprehensive immigration reform and said she would go further than President Obama in protecting undocumented immigrants from deportation.\nAs Maryland governor, he moved to give undocumented immigrants access to in-state tuition at the University of Maryland, a measure he supports nationally.\n\u201cWell, I voted numerous times when I was a Senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in,\u201d Clinton told the audience."}
