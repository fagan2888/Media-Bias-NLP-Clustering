They channeled those emotions into one of their best wins of the season.\n\nJimmy Butler scored 23 points, and Pau Gasol had 21 points and 13 rebounds in the Bulls\u2019 105-96 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday.\n\nIn a game that featured several skirmishes, the Bulls outrebounded the NBA\u2019s No. 2 rebounding team 53-48.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to go out there and attack,\u201d Chicago forward Taj Gibson, who got a double technical with Oklahoma City\u2019s Serge Ibaka, said. \u201cIt\u2019s no time to be friends with anybody right now. We\u2019ve got enough friends in here. We\u2019re with each other 24-7. We can\u2019t go out there and look to be nice to everybody.\u201d\n\nDerrick Rose added 19 points, and Gibson had 13 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nChicago held the Thunder to 38.5-percent shooting, Oklahoma City\u2019s third-worst showing of the season.\n\nKevin Durant had 29 points, nine rebounds and seven assists for Oklahoma City, and Russell Westbrook added 26 points, eight assists and seven rebounds. The Thunder had won three straight and nine of 10.\n\n\u201cI think we did a really good job of making sure we closed out to 3-point shooters,\u201d Rose said. \u201cWe trusted the game plan. We know K.D. is a great 3-point shooter, (Anthony) Morrow, and Westbrook when his feet are set, and you just can\u2019t let them get hot. Everybody else on the team, we forced them to make shots and make plays.\u201d\n\nDurant said he didn\u2019t like the way the Thunder played at times when they got behind.\n\n\u201cIf you try to get it all back in one play, try to get a steal, try to come down and shoot a pull-up 3 \u2014 just doing stupid stuff that we did all night, it will be tough to win,\u201d Durant said.\n\nChicago led 51-37 with 4:58 left in the first half, but the Thunder cut it to 54-52 at halftime. Durant scored 19 points in the half, and Westbrook had 12 points and five assists.\n\nGasol and Butler each scored 11 points in the first half for the Bulls.\n\nChicago scored the first eight points of the second half to go up 62-52 and force the Thunder to call a timeout. The Bulls led 86-68 at the end of the third quarter.\n\nThe Bulls led by 18 at the end of the third quarter. Oklahoma City changed things up and played Morrow and Enes Kanter with Durant, Westbrook and Ibaka for most of the fourth quarter. A pair of 3-pointers by Morrow cut Chicago\u2019s lead to 97-89 with just under 5 minutes to play, but the Bulls hung on.\n\n\u201cWe withstood their run, which I think everyone knew they were going to go on in the fourth quarter, and they (the Bulls) made big plays down the stretch,\u201d Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said.\n\nSTAT LINES\n\nThe lineup that Oklahoma City started the fourth quarter with \u2014 Durant, Westbrook, Ibaka, Kanter and Morrow \u2014 outscored the Bulls 28-19. Morrow and Kanter don\u2019t start, in part, because of defensive shortcomings, but that group held the Bulls to 6-for-20 shooting.\n\nKANTER\u2019S SOCKS\n\nKanter wore Christmas socks with green stripes and red snowflakes. He is a Muslim, but he said he respects different cultures. \u201cWell, I live in the U.S. now, and I\u2019m just really cool with all of the holidays \u2014 Christmas, Thanksgiving,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\n\nQUOTABLE\n\nGibson, on defending Westbrook: \u201cRuss is a hard opponent to go against, especially with the way he attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe just all wanted bodies in front of him. Put bodies in front of him and make sure somebody contested him at the rim, and compete.\u201d\n\nTIP-INS\n\n-Bulls: Ran out to an 11-0 lead. \u2026 C Joakim Noah sat out with a left shoulder sprain. \u2026 Beat the Thunder 104-98 at United Center on Nov. 5. \u2026 Butler hit a 35-foot 3-pointer at the end of the first quarter. \u2026 Rose fouled out.\n\n-Thunder: Missed their first five shots. \u2026 C Steven Adams picked up two fouls in the first 2 minutes.
