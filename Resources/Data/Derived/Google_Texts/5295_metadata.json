Give Princess and Charles a big kiss for us.\u201d\n\nPrincess, 8, whose coat is tortoiseshell, was in her cage \u201cmaking muffins,\u201d as cat people like to say. Front paws padded up and down, as if kneading dough, a sign of calm.\n\nPrincess is aptly named, for she was about to receive a rarest jewel: a lifesaving kidney transplant.\n\nPenn Vet is one of three veterinary hospitals in the world doing kidney transplants in cats. Surgeon Lillian Aronson has done all 150 since Penn began in 1998. Princess would be 151.\n\nCharles, the donor cat, wasn\u2019t quite as calm as Princess in his adjacent cage in the transplant office. He is a country cat, from a shelter in York County that supplies donor cats to Penn. Being a cat, he couldn\u2019t consent to having his organ harvested, and at that moment, he wasn\u2019t too pleased.\n\nWere he able to reflect, however, his attitude might have changed. He avoids the possibility of euthanasia, a reality for millions of cats and dogs, and, like all donor cats at Penn, goes home with the animal whose life he is saving.\n\nThe American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals supports such \u201cethical\u201d transplants, as long as the shelter cat gets a good home. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals opposes them. \u201cThey have their organs removed against their will,\u201d an official said, \u201cand it\u2019s not in their best interests.\u201d\n\nCharles, an orange tabby, was wearing a cone collar because he kept trying to pull the IV out of his paw with his teeth. Nurse Lynn Beale, transplant-team coordinator, who loves caring for the donor cats, scooped him out of his cage and cooed: \u201cIt\u2019s OK, baby. It\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nAfter calming him in her lap, she carried him to the operating room.\n\nPenn\u2019s Matthew J. Ryan Veterinary Hospital treats 31,000 animals a year, including 13,000 in its emergency room. Patients are mostly dogs and cats, but also rabbits, ferrets, lizards, birds, even zoo animals - a jaguar, lion, kangaroo, and aardvark.\n\nPenn Vet has more than 60 veterinarians, many of whom do valuable research in cancer, neurological disorders, and gene therapy. \u201cOur clinicians treat your pet with breakthrough science, and their work is often translated by human doctors into lifesaving human treatments,\u201d reads a hospital brochure.\n\nHuman transplant began with animal experiments, but these surgeries benefit pets and owners, not science. \u201cI can\u2019t really say that anything we have learned from these patients is something they didn\u2019t already know in humans,\u201d Aronson said.\n\nIsn\u2019t it an extravagance?\n\n\u201cYou could say that about any procedure that\u2019s not a spay-neuter,\u201d Aronson said. \u201cWhy do we do minimally invasive surgery? Why should we do emergency surgery? Nothing\u2019s better than to take an animal that has been suffering and improve its quality of life. These are our patients. We\u2019re trying to save their lives. And you see the emotional ties these families have. You feel like you\u2019re saving the life of a family member.\u201d\n\nIn Operating Room 3, Charles lay on one table, Princess on another, both covered in sterile blue paper, exposing only the surgical area, their bellies.\n\nSkytron lights were overhead. Trays with scalpels, clamps, and scissors flanked operating tables. Ten people on the transplant team were in gown, mask, hat, and booties.\n\nCharles went first. Aronson cut a six-inch incision and inspected his kidney, making sure it would be suitable for transplant.\n\nAll donor cats go through testing, even, yes, a CT or \u201ccat\u201d scan. They must be disease-free and have \u201carchitectural perfection\u201d in their kidneys.\n\nCharles was perfect. He was covered for warmth and monitored; his kidney would be taken in hours.\n\nPrincess was next.\n\nAronson worked by looking through a microscope, and the image was shown on a large screen for others to see.\n\nSurgical resident Chloe Wormser assisted.\n\nDuring surgery at Penn Vet, a suturing thread as fine as a human hair is used to stitch tiny blood vessels in one of the cats.\n\nImaging before surgery showed an extra blood vessel possibly in the way. Now, Aronson was exploring it. \u201cCould be a problem,\u201d she told her team.\n\n\u201cThis is a first,\u201d she said. The room was quiet except for the amplified heartbeats as she considered options. \u201cWe\u2019re going to isolate it and (move) it out of our surgery field,\u201d she concluded. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to touch it.\u201d\n\nPrincess was 10 pounds, but in Aronson\u2019s view was a \u201cfat\u201d cat \u2014 meaning she had a deep abdomen with organs hard to reach.\n\nIt took Aronson until 1 p.m. to have Princess ready for the big moment.\n\nIn 2004, Aronson did a transplant on a cat from York. Its owner was involved with a shelter there, and York became the source of donor cats.\n\nBeale, who owns two dogs, a cat, and a horse that pokes his head through her kitchen window on warm days, drives to York a few times a year to pick up donor cats. Beale renames each batch, always thematically.\n\nShe\u2019s done vegetables: Rutabaga, Zucchini, Bok Choy; beans: Pinto, Garbanzo, Butterbean; pastas: Ziti, Tortellini, Rigatoni.\n\nLast year, driving home, she heard Jim Croce\u2019s \u201cBad, Bad Leroy Brown\u201d on the radio and began singing at the top of her lungs. The cat on the front seat began howling in protest. On the spot, Beale named him Leroy Brown, and his mates James Brown, Charlie Brown, Zac Brown, and Sawyer Brown.\n\nThe current batch is named after the housekeeping staff at Penn Vet.\n\nLeroy Brown, by the way, donated his left kidney to a cat owned by Robin Quivers, sidekick to radio personality Howard Stern. The rich and famous have brought cats in for transplant from as far as Brazil and the Middle East, but Aronson and Beale say most people who pony up $18,000 to $25,000, the average cost, are just ordinary Americans who love their pets.\n\nBeale said pet owners have raided their 401(k)s and taken out second mortgages. A young couple, newlyweds, said Beale, \u201cwere using money that they had gotten at their wedding for a down payment on a house.\u201d\n\nShe turned them down, but they insisted. \u201cThe cost,\u201d said Beale, \u201cusually does not deter people.\u201d\n\nThe average age of a cat receiving a transplant at Penn Vet is 8. Ninety-two percent have left the hospital; 70 percent are alive after one year; the median survival is 1,000 days.\n\nInvariably, Aronson said, the recipient family is so grateful, it wants to adopt the donor cat.\n\nAbout 1:30 p.m., Aronson removed Charles\u2019 kidney.\n\nAt its simplest, Aronson made three cuts - to the artery leading into the kidney, the vein leading out, and the ureter that connected to the bladder.\n\nAronson cupped the kidney in two hands and carried it to Princess. It looked the size of a robin\u2019s egg, gray without blood.\n\nThe pressure was on.\n\nOnce Aronson clamped the artery and vein in Princess - where the surgeon planned to attach the new kidney - much of the blood supply to her hind legs would be restricted.\n\nSo suturing was a race against the clock.\n\nStitching must be so tight that there are no leaks. The best way to go fast was to go slow.\n\nAs Aronson worked on Princess, Susan Volk, a fellow surgeon, tended to Charles. By 2:45, he was all sewn up. His breathing tube was removed, and he began waking up.\n\n\u201cHi, gorgeous!\u201d Beale said, and carried him off the table. He is expected to live a full and healthy life with one kidney.\n\nThere was a visitor that day in surgery.\n\nStephen Guy, a human transplant surgeon at Hahnemann University Hospital, had come to watch.\n\n\u201cSo what do you think?\u201d Aronson asked as she worked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what we do, only smaller,\u201d he said.\n\nBy 2:50 p.m., the artery and vein from the new kidney were sewn tight.\n\n\u201cVenous clamp being removed,\u201d Aronson said.\n\nThe kidney expanded and turned a healthy red as it filled with blood.\n\nAlmost immediately the kidney began working, as urine flowed through the ureter, still unattached.\n\n\u201cWe like pee,\u201d said Aronson.\n\nConnecting the ureter to the bladder was delicate work. A cat ureter is smaller in diameter than the needle in a flu shot. Aronson used suturing thread as thin as human hair.\n\nAt home that morning, Aronson\u2019s children, 10, 9, 6, and 4, had, as they do every morning before a transplant, serenaded her: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You\u2019ll do great! Cha Cha Cha.\u201d At moments like this, she appreciated the support.\n\nAbout 4:30 p.m., after more than six hours, Princess\u2019 surgery was done. Masks came off. Princess was breathing on her own.\n\nBeale was first to speak to her. \u201cOh, there she is. She\u2019s my girl.\u201d\n\nPrincess was wheeled into the ICU.\n\nThe surgeon from Hahnemann thanked Aronson. He had taken many photos. He was going to put together a slide show for his team, and invite Aronson.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have a spirited discussion,\u201d he said.\n\nAronson called the family. \u201cWe just finished, and everything went really well,\u201d she told Coffee.\n\n\u201cOh, wonderful,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt was a little challenging, but she did really well. Kidney was making nice urine at the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d said Coffee. \u201cGet some rest. We really appreciate what you\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo eat something,\u201d Aronson said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m sure you haven\u2019t eaten anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cI bet you haven\u2019t either,\u201d he replied.\n\nAronson hung up.\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s up to her,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done our part.\u201d\n\nCoffee and his wife and two children live in a 4,500-square-foot home in Dayton with three rooms dedicated to their cats and a full-time employee who drives them to the vet and looks after them.\n\nThe Coffees got their first six cats at a local shelter, but then people started taking them cats, and strays would somehow show up. Princess appeared four years ago. Their vet found evidence of five broken ribs, suggesting abuse.\n\nTwo strays were pregnant, their kittens too cute to give up. Soon, they had 27 cats.\n\nCoffee says he owns antique cars around the country. One of their cats is named Bentley because he appeared when Coffee was in his garage, by the Bentley.\n\nIn 2004, one of their sweetest cats, Ginger, died needing a kidney transplant.\n\n\u201cShe has a husband in our group named Jack,\u201d Balazs said. \u201cAnd they loved each other and they were a couple, and he sat by her and adored her from the moment we rescued her.\u201d\n\nGinger was too sick for a transplant. The Coffees resolved to save Princess if they could.\n\nTheir own veterinarian in Dayton suggested they just donate the money to area shelters, rather than spend it on one cat. Kathryn Balazs said she and her husband were generous with many charities for humans and animals and did not see this as extravagant.\n\n\u201cEvery one of these cats is part of our family,\u201d she said.\n\nThe 27 names:\n\nJack, Romeo, Burt, Tupper (looks like a British gentleman), Lilly, Daisy, Emma, Tony, Lucy, Jimmy, Ava, Rosie, Charlie, Misha, Hannah, Frankie, Molly, Bella, Lola, Owen, Winnie, Lexi, Bentley, Kayla, Sophie , Cheddar (he\u2019s orange), and Princess.\n\nAnd now Charles, 28.\n\nOn Friday, Nov. 7, eight days after surgery, the Coffees came to take the cats home. The couple and their daughter, Madison, 7, walked into Beale\u2019s office and fell to their knees.\n\nMother and daughter went to Charles. Dad went to Princess.\n\nCoffee, 6-feet-6, 240 pounds, poked his head in her cage and scratched her chin.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my girl,\u201d he purred. \u201cLong road, huh?\u201d\n\nPrincess, quietly convalescing, opened her eyes wide. Her ears perked, and she got up and gave him a gentle head butt.\n\nCharles, shy, wasn\u2019t given a chance to be timid with Madison, who soon climbed inside his cage.\n\n\u201cMommy, do you think Charles will be sleeping with me tonight?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I bet he will be.\u201d\n\nFinally, it was time to go.\n\nThe cats were placed in their travel carriers for the flight. Beale instructed Balazs in all of Princess\u2019 medicines. Then hugs all around.\n\n\u201cThank you so much, of course,\u201d said Coffee.\n\n\u201cThank you for saving Princess,\u201d said Balazs.\n\n\u201cAnytime,\u201d said Aronson.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we roll,\u201d said Beale.\n\nAronson went off to another surgery. Beale walked them out.\n\n\u201cGet home safe,\u201d Beale said, closing their rental-car door. She stood in the autumn sunshine, watching, as the Coffees and their cats drove away.\n\n___\n\nOnline:\n\nhttp://bit.ly/1sXAdUg\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Philadelphia Inquirer, http://www.inquirer.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "At 6:54 a.m., Brian Coffee, a vintage-car collector in Dayton, Ohio, e-mailed the transplant team at the University of Pennsylvania veterinary hospital.", "Author": "MICHAEL VITEZ", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/22/feline-kidney-transplants-extravagance-or-love/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "At 6:54 a.m., Brian Coffee, a vintage-car collector in Dayton, Ohio, e-mailed the transplant team at the University of Pennsylvania veterinary hospital.", "title": "Feline kidney transplants: extravagance or love?"}, "twitter": {"title": "Feline kidney transplants: extravagance or love?", "description": "At 6:54 a.m., Brian Coffee, a vintage-car collector in Dayton, Ohio, e-mailed the transplant team at the University of Pennsylvania veterinary hospital.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "Princess is aptly named, for she was about to receive a rarest jewel: a lifesaving kidney transplant.\nIts owner was involved with a shelter there, and York became the source of donor cats.\nPenn Vet is one of three veterinary hospitals in the world doing kidney transplants in cats.\nAbout 1:30 p.m., Aronson removed Charles\u2019 kidney.\nIn 2004, one of their sweetest cats, Ginger, died needing a kidney transplant."}
