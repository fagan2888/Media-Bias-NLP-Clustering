I have personally watched its slow death in my 17 years as a private practice radiologist. Each new government intrusion into the doctor\u2019s office\u2014most recently with the Affordable Care Act\u2014invariably adds costs, thickens red tape, and places new barriers between doctors and our patients.\n\nUltimately, these burdens encourage the centralization of health care at the expense of private practice\u2014and our patients\u2019 well-being.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRecent health care trends bear this out. In 2005, roughly two-thirds of medical practices across the country were physician-owned, with hospitals owning just a third. In the nine years since, however, physician-owned practices have plummeted to approximately half, with thousands of private practices closing their doors each year.\n\nWhat is driving this shift? Primarily bureaucratic hassle and incentive structures infected with government meddling.\n\nWashington bureaucrats have already drafted at least 13,000 pages of regulations since the president signed the Affordable Care Act into law. This red tape\u2014which requires physicians to fill out specific forms, document specific health patterns, and more\u2014dramatically affects physicians\u2019 daily routine.\n\nToday, I spend twice as much time per patient filling out paperwork compared to when the ACA was passed in 2010. It would be one thing if that time was spent with the patient\u2014instead it\u2019s spent at the computer. Mandatory and redundant file keeping has become so time-consuming that our practice had to hire a full-time chief compliance officer (CCO). As any practice owner will tell you, CCOs don\u2019t come cheap.\n\nMedicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates are also problematic. Private practices are reimbursed less than hospitals for providing exactly the same service. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission notes that while Medicare pays $98.70 for a 15-minute consultation at a hospital, it only pays $58 for the same visit at a doctor\u2019s office. Our radiology practice is paid less for providing the identical services in our outpatient imaging center than the hospital is paid. Same service, same outcome, different pay.\n\nThese two factors\u2014higher costs, lower pay\u2014incentivize doctors to abandon private practice for hospitals and hospital-owned practices. Hospitals are simply better able to shoulder these and other administrative costs of health care in the post-ACA environment.\n\nI am deeply concerned by this trend\u2014and patients should be, too. The doctor-patient relationship is most effective at the private practice level. It encourages the personal, open, and forthright dialogue that so often contributes to better health outcomes.\n\nIt is understandable, then, that private practice\u2019s decline has had a profound impact on how patients receive medical care.\n\nFirst, the centralization of healthcare into ever-larger networks is limiting patients\u2019 access to care. In 2012, the average private practice physician saw 22 patients per day, while hospital-employed physicians saw only 18. Extrapolated over the course of a year, each employed physician would see nearly 1,000 fewer patients annually than their private practice counterparts.\n\nAs more physicians flee private practice, patients may find it more difficult to schedule a doctor\u2019s appointment. This tends to drive patients to seek care in the emergency room setting, which increases the cost of care.\n\nIncentives currently built into the hospital and hospital-owned practice models are fueling physicians\u2019 flight. Private practice physician incomes are dependent on the number of patients they see. Hospital-employed physicians, however, initially receive the same salary regardless of whether they see 20 or 50 patients a day. These incentives matter.\n\nLarger practices may also bode ill for patient health. A recent study published in the health journal Health Affairs found that practices with 1-2 physicians had 33 percent fewer preventable hospital admissions than practices with 10-19, while those with 3-9 physicians had 27 percent fewer.\n\nMost upsetting is that this death of private practice is no organic evolution of 21st century health care\u2014it\u2019s the intended result of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s architects. Shortly after the law was passed in 2010, President Obama\u2019s director of the White House Office of Health Reform wrote in the Annals of Internal Medicine that it will \u201caccelerate physician employment by hospitals and aggregation into larger physician groups.\u201d Unfortunately for patients, that\u2019s one of the few promises they\u2019ve actually kept.\n\nThe only winners\u2014if you can call them that\u2014of this centralized design are the bureaucrats in Washington who can assert more control over a shrinking number of health care providers. The losers are the thousands of private practice physicians being forced to abandon decades of hard work\u2014and the millions of patients they used to treat.\n\nHowshar is a radiologist based in Ft.
