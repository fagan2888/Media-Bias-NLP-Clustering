Obama made the trip to Cannon Ball, North Dakota because he believes the United States needs to do a better job to help Native Americans.\n\nThe President met with the children on the Standing Rock Reservation before the tribe's annual Flag Day powwow.\n\nPresident Obama during his trip announced plans to reform the Bureau of Indian Education to help Native American children receive better education. The White House also hopes to help Native Americans as they deal with the continuous struggles with unemployment.\n\nBack in KELOLAND, Becky Red Earth-Villeda of the Flandreau Indian Reservation is happy to see the President of the United States taking an interest in Native Americans, but she says more work needs to be done.\n\n\u201cGet to the truth. Don't just let this be 'Oh I checked in with a reservation to see what I can do and this is what I ended up with,' and don't follow through. Please be a person that can complete what it is you say you're going to do,\u201d Red Earth-Villeda said.\n\nThe last President to visit an Indian Reservation was Bill Clinton in 1999.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "President Barack Obama is just the third sitting President in the last eight decades to step foot on an Indian Reservation.
