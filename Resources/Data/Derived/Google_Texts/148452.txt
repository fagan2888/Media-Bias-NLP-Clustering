A man was killed when the helicopter he was piloting crashed Saturday in a Cottle County field.

Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper Chris Ray said Joshua Fitts, 34, of West Hurricane, Utah, was killed about 12:20 p.m. when the tail rotor of the McDonnell Douglas helicopter crashed after clipping a transmission line pulley, called a sheave. The helicopter was hovering next to a utility pole while attempting to connect the line when the accident occurred, Ray said.

Fitts was pronounced dead at the scene by Justice of the Peace Hank White. There were no other injuries reported from the crash.
