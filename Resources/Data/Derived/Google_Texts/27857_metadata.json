The fact that Gov. Bill Haslam stood by for two years, allowing Obamacare bogeymen to fan flames of distrust in everything associated with the White House, and then thought he could sweep in and change everybody\u2019s mind through a special legislative session?\n\nOr \u2014\n\n2. The fact that six of the seven Republican senators who killed Insure Tennessee in committee, denying health coverage to 280,000 low-income citizens, are \u2014 ta-da! \u2014 conveniently enrolled in the state\u2019s medical insurance plan?\n\nIf it\u2019s No. 1, Hizzoner needs a refresher course in Politics 101.\n\nRight or wrong, you can\u2019t be \u201cagin\u201d something and then suddenly be \u201cfer\u201d it. At least you do at your own peril.\n\nPerception too often is reality. It doesn\u2019t matter that Insure Tennessee differed from the federal Affordable Care Act; what matters is that opponents of both linked them like blood brothers.\n\nThe resulting face-slap for Mr. Haslam: Ye reap what ye sow.\n\nIf the answer is No. 2, it reinforces the image of sleazy politicians of all stripes: I got mine; screw you.\n\nBut hold on; it gets worse. This vote to shaft part-time workers came from people who are part-time employees of the state themselves!\n\nHowever you cut it, here was a despicable display of 100-proof, middle-finger politics.\n\nIt is doubly \u2014 not to mention tragically \u2014 ironic that just days after the poor were cast aside, hundreds of needy Tennesseans flocked to Chilhowee Park for treatment by Stan Brock\u2019s Remote Area Medical teams.\n\nLet that sink in.\n\nBrock (yes, the same man who earned fame on the \u201cWild Kingdom\u201d TV series and has dedicated his life and fortune to humanitarian causes) established RAM to bring health care to isolated communities. It is both shameful and embarrassing that many of these \u201cisolated communities\u201d lie in the center of Southern Appalachian cities today.\n\nOh, well. Perhaps something positive will rise from the ashes of this dumpster fire. I\u2019d like to think there will be enough adverse reaction to right this wrong somewhere down the pike. Maybe there\u2019s a way to bridge the gap.\n\nBut you never know. Radicals take great pride in cutting off their noses to spite their faces.\n\nIn the meantime, life goes on.\n\nThe low-income and disfranchised will continue to worry about staying well.\n\nAnd down at the legislative country club, they\u2019ll keep worrying about the condition of the putting greens.\n\nParty on.\n\nSam Venable\u2019s column appears Sunday and Thursday.
