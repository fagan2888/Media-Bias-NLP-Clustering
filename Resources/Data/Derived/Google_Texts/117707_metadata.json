She has said, \u201cbut ask yourself: President Obama had a lot of donations. Did that stop him from signing Dodd-Frank, the toughest regulation against the financial sector?\u201d\n\nClinton has also said she doesn\u2019t expect someone seeking the Democratic nomination to be criticizing Obama like Sanders is.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Pfeiffer", "description": "'President Obama's harshest critic'", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "As the Democratic race heats up, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is actively campaigning as a continuation of the Obama years and trying to paint Bernie Sanders's agenda as a sharp rebuke to", "title": "Clinton Campaign Attempts To Paint Sanders As The Anti-Obama", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/15/clinton-campaign-attempts-to-paint-sanders-as-the-anti-obama/", "image": {"width": 1024, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GettyImages-151987957-e1455567566999.jpg", "height": 440}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'President Obama's harshest critic'", "title": "Clinton Campaign Attempts To Paint Sanders As The Anti-Obama Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2016/02/15/clinton-campaign-attempts-to-paint-sanders-as-the-anti-obama/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GettyImages-151987957-e1455567566999.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-02-15 16:18:34", "sailthru.title": "Clinton Campaign Attempts To Paint Sanders As The Anti-Obama", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "barack-obama,bernie-sanders,elections-2016,hillary-clinton,alex-pfeiffer", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "barack obama,bernie sanders,elections 2016,hillary clinton", "sailthru.description": "As the Democratic race heats up, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is actively campaigning as a continuation of the Obama years and trying to paint Bernie Sanders's agenda as a sharp rebuke to", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/GettyImages-151987957-e1455567566999.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbd2b\"", "article_summary": "She has said, \u201cbut ask yourself: President Obama had a lot of donations.\nIn an effort to rebuke Sanders\u2019 arguments against the current campaign finance system, Hillary has brought up the fact that Obama himself received millions from the financial sector.\nPainting Sanders as being against Barack Obama could also potentially help Clinton with the black vote.\n4901630As the Democratic race heats up, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is actively campaigning as a continuation of the Obama years and trying to paint Bernie Sanders\u2019s agenda as a sharp rebuke to the current president.\nVoters also view Clinton as the continuation of Obama as 68 percent of Iowa Democrats saw her as the candidate best positioned to generally continue Obama\u2019s policies."}
