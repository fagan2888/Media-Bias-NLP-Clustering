This places power safely beyond the reach of public response, especially since agencies have grown so rich and powerful that they\u2019re effectively immune to reform. Laws passed by representatives you vote for blossom into a thousand times as many regulations, devised and enforced by people who will never be tested at the ballot box. Major laws are often written in such a vague way that the regulators have all the real power, as in the case of ObamaCare, which wasn\u2019t even fully written on the day Democrats forced it through Congress.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nStatist politicians love the imperial bureaucracy, because it allows them to manipulate the public, punish their enemies, and reward their constituents without getting their hands dirty. Rarely are the incumbent candidates you get to vote against held accountable for the actions of the bureaucrats they empower.\n\nThe imperial bureaucracy has grown so powerful and arrogant that it doesn\u2019t even feel like answering questions from the public any more. True accountability would interfere with the power of the State, so accountability is routinely evaded. The Obama Administration has become legendary for its refusal to cooperate with everything from Freedom of Information Act requests to congressional subpoenas. The legislature is no longer a co-equal branch of government. It\u2019s not even able to demand straight answers to its questions any more.\n\nThis lack of transparency is an important part of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email scandal, which is a big story (despite the efforts of friendly journalists to minimize it) because it\u2019s damaging her presidential aspirations but also concerns actions she took while an official of the Obama Administration.\n\nClinton asserts that neither Congress nor the American people have any right to ask questions about her activities as Secretary of State, except those questions she feels like discussing. She asserts the right to set up a private email server to evade congressional oversight and public inquiry \u2013 and nothing that happens now can change the fact that she did evade such oversight, because even if she actually had given us full disclosure and handed over her 100 percent intact mail server in 2015, it wouldn\u2019t change the way she was able to hide subpoena- and FOIA-responsive data from 2009 to 2013.\n\nClinton is just a high-profile example of bureaucratic arrogance, and the State Department isn\u2019t the primary culprit when it comes to micro-managing American life, although anyone who lost potential employment due to State\u2019s role in blocking the Keystone XL pipeline can testify that every appendage of the federal monstrosity is capable of pushing us around.\n\nWho can forget Attorney General Eric Holder and his subordinates stonewalling their way through Operation Fast and Furious hearings, offering ridiculous excuses for why nobody knew anything about a huge and deadly gun-running program that involved numerous federal agencies? Holder was an early pioneer of the Incompetence Defense, the now-ubiquitous excuse offered by nearly every Obama Administration official who comes under fire, including the President himself: I\u2019m not a very good manager and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in my agency, so you can\u2019t hold me accountable for anything.\n\nThe Incompetence Defense only works because ineptitude isn\u2019t a problem for imperial bureaucrats \u2013 they know they can\u2019t really get in trouble for wasting money or professing ignorance of what their immense departments are doing. \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d has become an impervious shield against congressional inquiry, not a career-ending admission of incompetence. Remember IRS officials, right up to the commissioner, saying that over and over again, to deflect questions about the Tea Party targeting scandal? The unspoken second half of those statements is, I don\u2019t know, and the elected representatives of the American people have no power to judge me or my agency for not knowing.\n\nThe recent hearings on \u201cOperation Choke Point,\u201d a controversial program the government is using to kill off legal businesses our Ruling Class don\u2019t like, was a festival of evasions and outright refusal to answer questions. The bureaucrats involved were visibly annoyed that they had to waste time telling Congress to get bent. At one point, an exasperated Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI) told FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg that if he really doesn\u2019t know anything about the activities of his agency, he ought to step down as chairman. We\u2019re only a couple of generations removed from a time when that would have been the public\u2019s near-universal expectation to professed ignorance and confusion from high officials, but now the loyal soldiers of the all-powerful executive can protect its interests without actually falling on their swords, or even pretending that they have swords to fall on.\n\nAnother recent outrage was Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray airily informing Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO) that she, and the American people, have no business asking how much money his agency blew on its majestic headquarters \u2013 $125 million, in case you\u2019re wondering. His exact words were, \u201cWhy does that matter to you?\u201d\n\nSo much for the \u201cpower of the purse!\u201d We\u2019ve descended to the point where princelings of the Beltway power elite feel free to tell the people nominally in charge of budgeting the government to buzz off, because they have no control over how much money our parasitic aristocrats decide to spend on their palaces. Rarely has it been more clearly stated that America exists to service its bureaucracy, not the other way around. You can vote for anyone you like, but none of them will get past the jewel-encrusted portcullis gates of the strongholds where real, eternal power dwells along the Potomac. Cordray already views his fiefdom as immortal, even though it\u2019s only a couple of years old.\n\nIf the CFPB is already a regal entity floating beyond the reach of our elected representatives, you can forget about doing anything to reform the IRS. Commissioner John Koskinen \u2013 the guy who said he didn\u2019t know nuthin\u2019 about no Lois Lerner emails a hundred times \u2013 told the National Press Club exactly that on Tuesday, laughing off the notion that his agency could ever be abolished. In fairness, he made a legitimate point that somebody has to collect revenue under even the simplest, flattest, fairest tax-returns-on-a-postcard system, but the balance of his remarks indicate he doesn\u2019t think the IRS will change much from the immense and unaccountable agency it has become.\n\nAnd then he topped it off with more of his \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d routine, addressing Hillary Clinton-style evasions of accountability at his agency by shrugging, \u201cWe have 87,000 people. Does that mean no one is doing it? I can\u2019t guarantee you that. But I can guarantee we\u2019re keeping a close watch on it.\u201d\n\nWell, no, you aren\u2019t, Commissioner. You just admitted that what most of us would consider a \u201cclose watch\u201d is impossible due to the size and power of your operation. We got a bellyful of what you think a \u201cclose watch\u201d means during the targeting scandal hearings.\n\nTake Koskinen at his word, and he\u2019s making an excellent case that transparency and accountability are mere illusions when the government grows to its current size. President Obama himself has excused his own inept management by arguing that the government is too big for any one person to take responsibility for its actions\u2026 and he offered that as a defense of himself, not an indictment of the system. Beltway culture offers us soothing illusions of responsible government limited by our electoral power, but in truth, it\u2019s too big to monitor, too powerful to restrain, and it has more power to change us than we have to change it.\n\nThe current system is inherently corrupt and uncontrollable because of its size \u2013 there are no big, honest, transparent governments. Evidence accumulates by the day that our rulers no longer feel even a vestigial sense of responsibility to voters, especially bureaucrats who will never have to face our wrath at the ballot box.\n\nThe really dangerous development is that they no longer fear the wrath of our elected representatives, many of whom are so interested in making the State bigger and richer that they\u2019ll no longer countenance even token attempts at holding it responsible for its actions, because that would empower the people who want to make it smaller. We are told to trust, and obey, and comfort ourselves with absurd fantasies about how we could \u201cfire\u201d the whole crew in Washington if they severely displeased us.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Imperial Bureaucracy Has No Use For Accountability", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "The Imperial Bureaucracy Has No Use For Accountability", "title": "The Imperial Bureaucracy Has No Use For Accountability - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/ap_ap-thumbnail-image47.jpg", "height": 344}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/04/01/the-imperial-bureaucracy-has-no-use-for-accountability/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Imperial Bureaucracy Has No Use For Accountability", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/ap_ap-thumbnail-image47.jpg", "title": "The Imperial Bureaucracy Has No Use For Accountability - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "accountability, Big Government, CFPB, Hillary Clinton, irs, john koskinen, Richard Cordray, transparency,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "transparency", "published_time": "2015-04-01T08:25:30-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "True accountability would interfere with the power of the State, so accountability is routinely evaded.\nThe imperial bureaucracy has grown so powerful and arrogant that it doesn\u2019t even feel like answering questions from the public any more.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d has become an impervious shield against congressional inquiry, not a career-ending admission of incompetence.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERStatist politicians love the imperial bureaucracy, because it allows them to manipulate the public, punish their enemies, and reward their constituents without getting their hands dirty.\nAnd then he topped it off with more of his \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d routine, addressing Hillary Clinton-style evasions of accountability at his agency by shrugging, \u201cWe have 87,000 people."}
