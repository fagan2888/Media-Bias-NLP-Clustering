HHS has requested a contingency fund for 2015, due to the \u201crapidly expanding Unaccompanied Alien Children program.\u201d\n\nThe majority of funding goes to nonprofit organizations and charities that provide living arrangements, education, health care, vocational training, mental health services, and other services.\n\nKenneth Wolfe, a spokesperson for HHS\u2019s Administration of Children and Families, said approximately 88 percent of minors within the program are placed with family members or a verified sponsor in the U.S.\n\nThe number of young illegal aliens flooding the border has skyrocketed in recent years. In 2009, only 6,639 unaccompanied alien children were resettled, and the number remained stable until 2011, with 7,120. In 2012, there were twice as many unaccompanied alien children at 14,271, the same year the administration announced its deferred action for young illegal aliens. By 2013 there were 25,498.\n\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, a total of 47,017 unaccompanied alien children have crossed the border this year.\n\nThe majority of funding for the UAC program goes towards foster care. Southwest Key, an Austin, Texas-based nonprofit that shelters unaccompanied alien children, is the largest government partner for the program, receiving grants worth $95,462,918 so far this fiscal year.\n\nNonprofits outside of border states also receive funding to shelter illegal alien children. The New Jersey Heartland Human Care Services in Chicago has received $19,118,403 this year, while the Union County Department of Human Services in New Jersey received $550,384 on March 20.\n\nThe influx of alien children has forced the government to place emergency orders for clothing, shelter, and interpreter services.\n\nThe government ordered $6,040 of \u201cMission Critical\u201d footwear on June 12 for the \u201clarge influx of unaccompanied alien children along the Rio Grande Valley border.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Homeland Security spent $24,815 on children and infants\u2019 apparel on June 13, and $13,339 on men\u2019s outerwear June 27.\n\nA sweatshirt order worth $3,428 from Promotions Plus, Inc. was also ordered on Jan. 1 for children being \u201ctransported from the southwest border to Chicago and Berks, Pa.\u201d\n\nMore than $100,000 for telephone interpreter services were also ordered for the program at the end of June.\n\nThe president\u2019s request for $3.7 billion in additional funding would go to HHS to provide shelter for the influx of young illegal aliens.\n\nSen. Tom Coburn (R., Okla.) suggested on Wednesday that it would be cheaper to fly the children back home first class.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting a lot of kids at risk,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. \u201cRemember, this is organized crime that is selling this and these three countries that you can get them here and they\u2019ll be here and they\u2019re extracting large amounts of money and then abusing children as they carry them up here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s terrible. The best way to stop that is to have airplanes landing every day bringing these children back to their country of origin,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe president just asked for $3.7 billion, for less than $20 million we can fly them all back first class,\u201d Coburn added. \u201cSo think about how stupid our policy is.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The federal program for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC)\u2014which provides long-term foster care, apparel, and interpreter services for thousands of young illegal immigrants, the majority of which ar", "title": "Unaccompanied Alien Children Program Cost $263 Million Already This Year", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/unaccompanied-alien-children-program-cost-263-million-already-this-year/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/detainee-children-mexico-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The federal program for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC)\u2014which provides long-term foster care, a", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/detainee-children-mexico-150x150.jpg", "title": "Unaccompanied Alien Children Program Cost $263 Million Already This Year", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae88\"", "article_summary": "In 2009, only 6,639 unaccompanied alien children were resettled, and the number remained stable until 2011, with 7,120.\nAccording to the Congressional Research Service, a total of 47,017 unaccompanied alien children have crossed the border this year.\nIn 2012, there were twice as many unaccompanied alien children at 14,271, the same year the administration announced its deferred action for young illegal aliens.\nSouthwest Key, an Austin, Texas-based nonprofit that shelters unaccompanied alien children, is the largest government partner for the program, receiving grants worth $95,462,918 so far this fiscal year.\nBY: Follow @LizWFBThe federal program for Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC)\u2014which provides long-term foster care, apparel, and interpreter services for thousands of young illegal immigrants, the majority of which are placed in the United States\u2014has already cost $263 million this year."}
