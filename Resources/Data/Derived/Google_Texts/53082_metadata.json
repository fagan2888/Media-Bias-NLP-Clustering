We discussed his role in brokering the recent fiscal deal, his outlook on future talks, and Republican expectations for divided government. He also spoke firmly of his commitment to keep the government open. \u201cA government shutdown is off the table,\u201d he says, looking ahead to a possible impasse early next year. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do it.\u201d\n\nCosta: When did you know this standoff was finally ending?\n\nMcConnell: I can tell you when I knew that we\u2019d end up here \u2014 July. We had extensive discussions in July about how the defund strategy couldn\u2019t possibly succeed. And it\u2019s really a matter of simple math: 54 is more than 46. And, of course, when you add in the president, you knew it had no chance of success. So I knew we\u2019d end up in the place where we ended up. What I could not have predicted is that we\u2019d end up in that place and have so few cards to play. To use a football analogy, by the time it was clear the House couldn\u2019t pass anything, I was on the two-yard line, trying to see how I could punt to get us into a better field position to live to fight another day without raising taxes or busting the [Budget Control Act] caps. Honestly, that\u2019s why it was a deal worth making. But it didn\u2019t have anything else attached to it because the House couldn\u2019t send anything that would give me any ability to negotiate. As you recall, that\u2019s the same problem we had last December 31 during the fiscal cliff. The speaker had an excellent \u201cPlan B\u201d with a $1 million threshold on taxes, but they couldn\u2019t pass it. If they had been able to send that over, we\u2019d have ended up a lot higher than $400,000, $450,000 for a couple.\n\n\n\nCosta: Is the House a functioning majority?\n\nMcConnell: Look, I\u2019m just going to talk about the facts. I\u2019m in a weaker position when the House can\u2019t act. Each of these occasions \u2014 all four of them, the two-year extension of the Bush tax cuts in 2010, the Budget Control Act of 2011, the fiscal cliff and making the tax cuts permanent, and this past week \u2014 we\u2019ve had to go first in the Senate. Now, in defense of the House, the first one, December 2010, they weren\u2019t yet the majority. But as a practical matter, we\u2019re in a weaker position when you don\u2019t have a more pro-Republican bill coming over to the Senate. So, the most I can say about yesterday is that we had a bipartisan agreement to get the government running and avoid default, to live to fight another day without compromising our principles on spending and taxes. We\u2019ll be back at it in January and February, but the issues will be the same. Keeping the BCA levels is a huge success, and I know because Democrats hate it.\n\n\n\nCosta: Explain the significance of keeping sequestration, in terms of putting those cuts on the table for legislative trades.\n\nMcConnell: The price for entitlement reform, so far from the administration, has been taxes. There is some willingness to discuss trading entitlement spending reductions for discretionary spending relief. But, so far, there has been no real willingness on the part of the administration to do that. That\u2019s worth discussing, though, because if you get real entitlement spending reductions, they tend to last \u2014 we don\u2019t tend to vote on it every year. Take the decision by Reagan and Tip O\u2019Neill to raise the age of Social Security; we never went back and revisited it, and it saved Social Security for a generation. And there\u2019s no question that as proud as I am of the Budget Control Act, that only deals with the discretionary side of the budget, and the biggest problem is on the entitlement side. Now, that\u2019s not an argument for not reducing discretionary spending, since I think the government is way too big, including on the discretionary side. But the biggest challenge we need to address is entitlements, and they don\u2019t want to.\n\n\n\nCosta: What\u2019s the snag?\n\nMcConnell: When the speaker has had conversations with the president over the last three years, they have always insisted on a $1 trillion tax increase \u2014 revenue scored by the Congressional Budget Office. That\u2019s their demand for any major entitlement reform. But we don\u2019t think we should have to pay a ransom to do what the country needs. And until you adjust the eligibility for entitlements to fit the demographics of our country, you can\u2019t ever solve the problem. You can\u2019t tax your way out of it, and there aren\u2019t enough health-care providers to cut to find a way out of it.\n\n\n\nCosta: Do you have any hopes for the budget conference?\n\nMcConnell: I wish them well. But with all due respect to all of my congressional colleagues, there is only one Democrat who really counts \u2014 the president. And they\u2019ll support whatever he agrees to. I\u2019ve said that to the president on a number of occasions: You\u2019re the Democrat who counts. If you\u2019re willing to work with us to solve this problem, don\u2019t use congressional Democrats as an excuse. They may not like it, but they\u2019ll vote with you. They didn\u2019t like the Budget Control Act, but they voted for it. He\u2019s the one who counts. What we haven\u2019t seen with him is the same kind of willingness to deal that we saw with Reagan, that we saw with Clinton. I think the president still fantasizes about the government he had during his first two years in office. There is a deep-seated reluctance to deal with the government he has. I\u2019d love to see the president move to the middle, and on all four occasions he has, I\u2019ve been directly involved and worked with him. But there should have been a lot of times. It\u2019s disappointing. He\u2019s going to be there for three more years. Maybe he\u2019ll have an epiphany.\n\n\n\nCosta: Are you willing to deal on revenue, perhaps via tax reform, where you\u2019d close loopholes without touching rates?\n\nMcConnell: Tax reform is possible, but they won\u2019t engage in dynamic scoring. We know if we had a more rational tax code, there would be more revenue through growth. They won\u2019t count dynamic revenue increases. They want revenue that\u2019s CBO scored. If we could get them to credit for revenue through growth, maybe we\u2019d get somewhere.\n\n\n\nCosta: You said we\u2019d be back here in January and February dealing with the same issues. Is another shutdown possible?\n\nMcConnell: No. One of my favorite sayings is an old Kentucky saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no education in the second kick of a mule.\u201d The first kick of the mule was in 1995; the second one was the last 16 days. A government shutdown is off the table. We\u2019re not going to do it.\n\n\n\nCosta: A lot of reporters think your decisions are driven by political considerations in your home state, especially your primary versus Matt Bevin and a potential general-election campaign versus Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes. How are those factors shaping your strategy?\n\nMcConnell: Oh, that\u2019s the Mother Jones thesis. I have nothing to say about my primary opponent. And this week, it\u2019s pretty obvious about whether that\u2019s driving my decisions. As for [Lundergan Grimes], the whole rationale for her candidacy is that I\u2019m part of the dysfunction in Washington, so she\u2019s probably been pretty unhappy over the past 24 hours. I\u2019ve demonstrated, once again, that when the Congress is in gridlock and the country is at risk, I\u2019m the guy who steps forward and tries to get us out of the ditch. So it\u2019s been a bad 24 hours for her, and she\u2019s going to need to find a new rationale.\n\n\n\nCosta: Looking ahead, what\u2019s your message to your colleagues about reasonable expectations for divided government?\n\nMcConnell: Thanks to the nature of the Senate, unless you\u2019re at 40, you\u2019re not irrelevant. We were irrelevant a few years ago, frankly, except for keeping unity for things we opposed, like Obamacare. But since then, we\u2019ve been a consequential minority. But you\u2019re only a consequential minority if you can hold together 41 people. Thanks to my colleagues, we\u2019ve had the ability at these critical moments to try to get as good an outcome as we could, given the cards that we\u2019ve been dealt. But one thing that\u2019s made it hard is the inability of the House of Representatives, on these occasions, to send us legislation that\u2019s more robust, proposals that have more of the things that I and my colleagues would prefer. We\u2019d have been in a much stronger position if they had been able to do that.\n\n\n\nCosta: And that\u2019s what happened yesterday.\n\nMcConnell: This thing that passed the Senate, which, honestly, only maintained the status quo for a few more months, was better than what the House tried to pass and couldn\u2019t pass, because it has a longer CR, which is what we wanted. That\u2019s how challenging it is when you can\u2019t get something more in line with what you\u2019d like to achieve over here. So, my job is to acquaint our members, the best I can, with the reality of our situation, and try to get them to enable me to get us all out of the ditch \u2014 and my members weren\u2019t happy being in a 16-day government shutdown and being a day away from rattling the markets by getting close to default. They knew I had a weak hand, given the time we had squandered on this quixotic venture that had no chance of success, but they asked me to find a way out and I did. Most of them voted for it, too, which I appreciated.\n\n\n\nCosta: How does the party get beyond this mess? It seems like you\u2019re having a civil war over tactics.\n\nMcConnell: Well, for one, we\u2019re not going to do this again in connection with the debt ceiling or with a government shutdown. Look, it\u2019s unlikely the Democratic Senate or Democratic president will do much on Obamacare. We did a minor little income-verification thing, an anti-fraud thing, but beyond that, it\u2019s unlikely. That\u2019s the bad news. The good news is that it\u2019s front and center for the 2014 election. Of the things we can predict for 2014, Obamacare will be front and center, especially in the red states where we could pick up seats.\n\n\n\nCosta: Has your relationship with Senate majority leader Harry Reid evolved over the past few weeks?\n\nMcConnell: It\u2019s better than it has been. We both knew that whatever differences we have, we had to put them aside yesterday for the good of the country. Our differences, however, are about issues. It\u2019s not personal. They want to raise taxes and bust the caps, and I don\u2019t want to raise taxes or bust the caps.\n\n\n\nCosta: One last thing: What\u2019s your take on Senator Ted Cruz, who led the \u201cquixotic venture\u201d?\n\nMcConnell: I don\u2019t have any observations to make on that.", "article_metadata": {"tweettext": "McConnell\u2019s Exit Interview", "sailthru.author": "Robert Costa", "description": "On Thursday morning, I sat down with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, in his Capitol office.

Maybe he\u2019ll have an epiphany.\n\nCosta: Are you willing to deal on revenue, perhaps via tax reform, where you\u2019d close loopholes without touching rates?\n\nMcConnell: Tax reform is possible, but they won\u2019t engage in dynamic scoring. We know if we had a more rational tax code, there would be more revenue through growth. They won\u2019t count dynamic revenue increases. They want revenue that\u2019s CBO scored. If we could get them to credit for revenue through growth, maybe we\u2019d get somewhere.\n\nCosta: You said we\u2019d be back here in January and February dealing with the same issues. Is another shutdown possible?\n\nMcConnell: No. One of my favorite sayings is an old Kentucky saying, \u201cThere\u2019s no education in the second kick of a mule.\u201d The first kick of the mule was in 1995; the second one was the last 16 days. A government shutdown is off the table. We\u2019re not going to do it.\n\nCosta: A lot of reporters think your decisions are driven by political considerations in your home state, especially your primary versus Matt Bevin and a potential general-election campaign versus Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes. How are those factors shaping your strategy?\n\nMcConnell: Oh, that\u2019s the Mother Jones thesis. I have nothing to say about my primary opponent. And this week, it\u2019s pretty obvious about whether that\u2019s driving my decisions. As for [Lundergan Grimes], the whole rationale for her candidacy is that I\u2019m part of the dysfunction in Washington, so she\u2019s probably been pretty unhappy over the past 24 hours. I\u2019ve demonstrated, once again, that when the Congress is in gridlock and the country is at risk, I\u2019m the guy who steps forward and tries to get us out of the ditch. So it\u2019s been a bad 24 hours for her, and she\u2019s going to need to find a new rationale.\n\nCosta: Looking ahead, what\u2019s your message to your colleagues about reasonable expectations for divided government?\n\nMcConnell: Thanks to the nature of the Senate, unless you\u2019re at 40, you\u2019re not irrelevant. We were irrelevant a few years ago, frankly, except for keeping unity for things we opposed, like Obamacare. But since then, we\u2019ve been a consequential minority. But you\u2019re only a consequential minority if you can hold together 41 people. Thanks to my colleagues, we\u2019ve had the ability at these critical moments to try to get as good an outcome as we could, given the cards that we\u2019ve been dealt. But one thing that\u2019s made it hard is the inability of the House of Representatives, on these occasions, to send us legislation that\u2019s more robust, proposals that have more of the things that I and my colleagues would prefer. We\u2019d have been in a much stronger position if they had been able to do that.\n\nCosta: And that\u2019s what happened yesterday.\n\nMcConnell: This thing that passed the Senate, which, honestly, only maintained the status quo for a few more months, was better than what the House tried to pass and couldn\u2019t pass, because it has a longer CR, which is what we wanted. That\u2019s how challenging it is when you can\u2019t get something more in line with what you\u2019d like to achieve over here. So, my job is to acquaint our members, the best I can, with the reality of our situation, and try to get them to enable me to get us all out of the ditch \u2014 and my members weren\u2019t happy being in a 16-day government shutdown and being a day away from rattling the markets by getting close to default. They knew I had a weak hand, given the time we had squandered on this quixotic venture that had no chance of success, but they asked me to find a way out and I did. Most of them voted for it, too, which I appreciated.\n\nCosta: How does the party get beyond this mess? It seems like you\u2019re having a civil war over tactics.\n\nMcConnell: Well, for one, we\u2019re not going to do this again in connection with the debt ceiling or with a government shutdown. Look, it\u2019s unlikely the Democratic Senate or Democratic president will do much on Obamacare. We did a minor little income-verification thing, an anti-fraud thing, but beyond that, it\u2019s unlikely. That\u2019s the bad news. The good news is that it\u2019s front and center for the 2014 election. Of the things we can predict for 2014, Obamacare will be front and center, especially in the red states where we could pick up seats.\n\nCosta: Has your relationship with Senate majority leader Harry Reid evolved over the past few weeks?\n\nMcConnell: It\u2019s better than it has been. We both knew that whatever differences we have, we had to put them aside yesterday for the good of the country. Our differences, however, are about issues. It\u2019s not personal. They want to raise taxes and bust the caps, and I don\u2019t want to raise taxes or bust the caps.\n\nCosta: One last thing: What\u2019s your take on Senator Ted Cruz, who led the \u201cquixotic venture\u201d?\n\nMcConnell: I don\u2019t have any observations to make on that.", "title": "McConnell\u2019s Exit Interview", "url": "http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/361533/mcconnells-exit-interview-robert-costa", "image": "http://c9.nrostatic.com/sites/default/files/page_2012_200_costa-new_2_square.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/361533/mcconnells-exit-interview-robert-costa", "description": "On Thursday morning, I sat down with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, in his Capitol office. We discussed his role in brokering the recent fiscal deal, his outlook on future talks, and Republican expectations for divided government. He also spoke firmly of his commitment to keep the government open. \u201cA government shutdown is off the table,\u201d he says, looking ahead to a possible impasse early next year. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do it.\u201d\n\nCosta: When did you know this standoff was finally ending?\n\nMcConnell: I can tell you when I knew that we\u2019d end up here \u2014 July. We had extensive discussions in July about how the defund strategy couldn\u2019t possibly succeed. And it\u2019s really a matter of simple math: 54 is more than 46. And, of course, when you add in the president, you knew it had no chance of success. So I knew we\u2019d end up in the place where we ended up. What I could not have predicted is that we\u2019d end up in that place and have so few cards to play. To use a football analogy, by the time it was clear the House couldn\u2019t pass anything, I was on the two-yard line, trying to see how I could punt to get us into a better field position to live to fight another day without raising taxes or busting the [Budget Control Act] caps. Honestly, that\u2019s why it was a deal worth making. But it didn\u2019t have anything else attached to it because the House couldn\u2019t send anything that would give me any ability to negotiate. As you recall, that\u2019s the same problem we had last December 31 during the fiscal cliff. The speaker had an excellent \u201cPlan B\u201d with a $1 million threshold on taxes, but they couldn\u2019t pass it. If they had been able to send that over, we\u2019d have ended up a lot higher than $400,000, $450,000 for a couple.\n\nCosta: Is the House a functioning majority?\n\nMcConnell: Look, I\u2019m just going to talk about the facts. I\u2019m in a weaker position when the House can\u2019t act. Each of these occasions \u2014 all four of them, the two-year extension of the Bush tax cuts in 2010, the Budget Control Act of 2011, the fiscal cliff and making the tax cuts permanent, and this past week \u2014 we\u2019ve had to go first in the Senate. Now, in defense of the House, the first one, December 2010, they weren\u2019t yet the majority. But as a practical matter, we\u2019re in a weaker position when you don\u2019t have a more pro-Republican bill coming over to the Senate. So, the most I can say about yesterday is that we had a bipartisan agreement to get the government running and avoid default, to live to fight another day without compromising our principles on spending and taxes. We\u2019ll be back at it in January and February, but the issues will be the same. Keeping the BCA levels is a huge success, and I know because Democrats hate it.\n\nCosta: Explain the significance of keeping sequestration, in terms of putting those cuts on the table for legislative trades.\n\nMcConnell: The price for entitlement reform, so far from the administration, has been taxes. There is some willingness to discuss trading entitlement spending reductions for discretionary spending relief. But, so far, there has been no real willingness on the part of the administration to do that. That\u2019s worth discussing, though, because if you get real entitlement spending reductions, they tend to last \u2014 we don\u2019t tend to vote on it every year. Take the decision by Reagan and Tip O\u2019Neill to raise the age of Social Security; we never went back and revisited it, and it saved Social Security for a generation. And there\u2019s no question that as proud as I am of the Budget Control Act, that only deals with the discretionary side of the budget, and the biggest problem is on the entitlement side. Now, that\u2019s not an argument for not reducing discretionary spending, since I think the government is way too big, including on the discretionary side. But the biggest challenge we need to address is entitlements, and they don\u2019t want to.\n\nCosta: What\u2019s the snag?\n\nMcConnell: When the speaker has had conversations with the president over the last three years, they have always insisted on a $1 trillion tax increase \u2014 revenue scored by the Congressional Budget Office. That\u2019s their demand for any major entitlement reform. But we don\u2019t think we should have to pay a ransom to do what the country needs. And until you adjust the eligibility for entitlements to fit the demographics of our country, you can\u2019t ever solve the problem. You can\u2019t tax your way out of it, and there aren\u2019t enough health-care providers to cut to find a way out of it.\n\nCosta: Do you have any hopes for the budget conference?\n\nMcConnell: I wish them well. But with all due respect to all of my congressional colleagues, there is only one Democrat who really counts \u2014 the president. And they\u2019ll support whatever he agrees to. I\u2019ve said that to the president on a number of occasions: You\u2019re the Democrat who counts. If you\u2019re willing to work with us to solve this problem, don\u2019t use congressional Democrats as an excuse. They may not like it, but they\u2019ll vote with you. They didn\u2019t like the Budget Control Act, but they voted for it. He\u2019s the one who counts. What we haven\u2019t seen with him is the same kind of willingness to deal that we saw with Reagan, that we saw with Clinton. I think the president still fantasizes about the government he had during his first two years in office. There is a deep-seated reluctance to deal with the government he has. I\u2019d love to see the president move to the middle, and on all four occasions he has, I\u2019ve been directly involved and worked with him. But there should have been a lot of times. It\u2019s disappointing. He\u2019s going to be there for three more years.
