A federal judge ruled Nebraska\u2019s ban was unconstitutional in 2005, but an 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel reversed the decision a year later.\n\nSue Stroesser, 51, learned how far-reaching Nebraska\u2019s ban is when she recently moved back to Omaha after spending years in Washington state and Iowa. Stroesser and her partner of 30 years were married in Iowa in 2009, and she took her spouse\u2019s last name.\n\nShe had no trouble getting a new Social Security card and passport with her married name. But when she went to a Department of Motor Vehicles branch this summer for a new Nebraska driver\u2019s license, she was denied.\n\nStroesser had held a Nebraska driver\u2019s license years earlier under her maiden name. When the clerk asked for documentation to corroborate the name change, Stroesser provided her marriage certificate. The DMV wouldn\u2019t accept that, Stroesser was told, and a passport or Social Security card wouldn\u2019t work, either.\n\n\u201cI was in tears,\u201d Stroesser said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I just had this overwhelming feeling of injustice. I just picked up my papers and left.\u201d\n\nNebraska DMV director Rhonda Lahm said her agency is following state law, and noted that the policy rejecting out-of-state, same-sex marriage licenses was in place before she took over.\n\nLahm also acknowledged she has the authority to change that policy \u2014 but won\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI feel that I\u2019m following the Nebraska Constitution,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the courts determine and say, \u2018You need to do something different,\u2019 we would do what the courts say.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nebraska unwavering on its same-sex marriage ban", "title": "Nebraska unwavering on its same-sex marriage ban", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/09/nebraska-unwavering-on-its-same-sex-marriage-ban/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140805__utah-gay-marriage-rallyp1.jpg", "height": 463}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140805__utah-gay-marriage-rallyp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-09T15:50:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T05:04:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc55\"", "article_summary": "But when she went to a Department of Motor Vehicles branch this summer for a new Nebraska driver\u2019s license, she was denied.\nFederal appeals courts covering nearly half the United States soon will hear arguments on same-sex marriage, after numerous bans were struck down in the past eight months.\nStroesser had held a Nebraska driver\u2019s license years earlier under her maiden name.\nThe state\u2019s hard-line stance is jarring when compared to neighboring Iowa, which was one of the first states to legalize same-sex marriage in 2009, said Charlie Joughin, spokesman for Washington, D.C.-based Human Rights Campaign.\nNebraska voters passed a state constitutional amendment in 2000 banning same-sex marriages, civil unions or even legalized domestic partnerships, and it has withstood all legal challenges."}
