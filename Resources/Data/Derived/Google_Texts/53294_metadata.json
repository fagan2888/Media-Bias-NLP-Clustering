Mike Lee (R-UT) in 2016.\n\nCNN\u2019s John King said on Inside Politics that national establishment leaders in the business community will join state establishment leaders to try to convince President Barack Obama\u2019s former Ambassador to China to challenge Lee.\n\nKing noted that Huntsman\u2019s deep-pocketed dad (Huntsman Sr., though, did pony up funds to his son\u2019s campaign down the stretch\u2013perhaps because he saw the writing on the wall.) does not like Lee (Huntsman Sr. is reportedly upset his cancer institute did not get taxpayer funds during the government shutdown.)\u2013Huntsman Sr. has reportedly been scouting potential challengers with others who are reportedly plotting to oust Lee.\n\nHuntsman strangely tried to win the 2012 GOP presidential nomination by attacking conservatives. That didn\u2019t work out too well. He is now with \u201cNo Labels,\u201d which brings together politicians from the bipartisan political class that both establishments love more than voters in both parties.\n\nLee helped ignite the Tea Party and inspired citizen-candidates across the country when he ousted incumbent Utah Sen. Bob Bennett in 2012. Because Lee has stood with conservatives in D.C. on some of the most important fights\u2013like repealing Obamacare and overturning Obama\u2019s executive amnesty\u2013the establishment, according to King, wants \u201crevenge\u201d on him.\n\nThough it is unlikely Huntsman will challenge Lee, the contrast between the two would not be more clear.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Report: GOP Estab Courting Jon Huntsman to Challenge Mike Lee", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Report: GOP Estab Courting Jon Huntsman to Challenge Mike Lee", "title": "Report: GOP Estab Courting Jon Huntsman to Challenge Mike Lee - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Jon-Hunstsman-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/02/15/report-gop-estab-courting-jon-huntsman-to-challenge-mike-lee/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Report: GOP Estab Courting Jon Huntsman to Challenge Mike Lee", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Jon-Hunstsman-AP.jpg", "title": "Report: GOP Estab Courting Jon Huntsman to Challenge Mike Lee - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Jon Huntsman, Mike Lee,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Mike Lee", "published_time": "2015-02-15T12:17:46-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc3ba\"", "article_summary": "does not like Lee (Huntsman Sr. is reportedly upset his cancer institute did not get taxpayer funds during the government shutdown.\n)\u2013Huntsman Sr. has reportedly been scouting potential challengers with others who are reportedly plotting to oust Lee.\nEstablishment Republicans are reportedly trying to convince former Utah Governor and failed 2012 presidential candidate Jon Huntsman to oust Sen.
