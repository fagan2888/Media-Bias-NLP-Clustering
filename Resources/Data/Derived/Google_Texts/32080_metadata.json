Several feet away, Morgan Clark, another paramedic, sat at a wooden kitchen table, methodically sorting some 10 different types of medication for Jones' heart problems, kidney disease, diabetes and other health problems into a color-coded pill box.  For about two months now, Wheat and Clark have visited Jones' house every week, checking his blood sugar, taking his blood pressure readings, setting up appointments with his doctor and helping Jones find a home health nurse.  Wheat and Clark are part of a new six-member group in the Montgomery County Hospital District, an adaptable team of paramedics that helps patients who repeatedly find themselves in the emergency room navigate a dauntingly complex health care system and identify more proactive approaches to their health.  Some patients they visit have only an elementary school education and can't understand the pages of verbose medical instructions they receive after being discharged from the hospital.  Jones would repeatedly end up in the emergency room after fainting due to low blood sugar because he didn't take his insulin shots or medication properly.  At Jones' house, when Clark swings open the door of the fridge, it's filled with gallon jugs of milk, regular and chocolate, orange juice and a bottle of Dr Pepper, which, upon some light interrogation, Jones coyly admits drinking from time to time.  With other patients, paramedics in these programs might do groceries, help them with their electric or water bills, or simply show up and provide a regular social presence in patients' lives.", "vf": {"section": "local", "unique_id": "premiumchron-article-5956946"}, "author.name": "By Mihir Zaveri", "og": {"site_name": "Houston Chronicle", "description": "William Jones sat on a brown sofa in his small, cluttered living room, as a paramedic rolled up his jean leg and pulled down his sock, revealing a limb swollen with fluid.
