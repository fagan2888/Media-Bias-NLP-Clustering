The reporters at Elizabeth Warren's West Virginia rally for Natalie Tennant noted that the Massachusetts senator did not stick around for questions, or submit to a scrum of reporters. (In the Senate, she generally does not stop and talk to the beat reporters who show up.) This saved her from having to answer, probably, questions about coal, where she would have had to stitch together several different versions of "we disagree." But almost simultaneously, Rep. Paul Ryan was in Charleston, a few hours down the highway, endorsing Tennant's opponent (who reminded everyone that "every county" in the state wanted the guy to be veep). He got questions; he dodged.
