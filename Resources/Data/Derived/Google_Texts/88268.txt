Sioux Falls, SD

The owner of the Wells Fargo Building on 9th and Phillips plans to develop a loft high-rise hotel on the corner where a surface parking lot is now located.

Real Estate Broker David Shelton represents building owner Roland Johnson. The multi-use project for the site is one of three before the City of Sioux Falls for consideration to be included with a $10 million city parking ramp.

But Shelton says even if their proposal isn't chosen by the city, the site will be redeveloped anyway. Shelton says they are in the process of getting the franchise for the hotel and will build it even if the city doesn't pick the property for the parking ramp.

The developers say they will also build an office high-rise, residences and an urban market, with hopes of attracting a Trader Joe's to downtown.
