Zimm was initially defiant, but quickly grew tired of her new home, according to a Twitter account started in her name.\n\nShe felt just a little lonely:\n\nBut still managed to keep a good attitude:\n\nCatch me if you can \ud83d\ude0f @MemphisZoo \u2014 Zimm the Monkey (@Zimm901) July 9, 2015\n\nThis drain is pretty cozy not gonna lie \u2014 Zimm the Monkey (@Zimm901) July 9, 2015\n\nA little damp but I could fix it up a bit, make it my own \u2014 Zimm the Monkey (@Zimm901) July 9, 2015\n\nThis drain is lame, let me out \u2014 Zimm the Monkey (@Zimm901) July 10, 2015\n\nI'm still in the drain.

She\u2019s getting checked out at the zoo\u2019s hospital and will return to the Primate Canyon soon, where she hopes her Twitter fame will gain her some real-life visitors:\n\n\u201cWhew!
