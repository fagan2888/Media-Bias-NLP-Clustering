They were acting on orders from the Narcotics Enforcement Unit, who asked the shop to hand over a customer list so they could determine how many people had purchased New York SAFE Act compliant rifles. The gun owner was forced to present approximately 170 sales records. Under the state's anti-gun law, this intrusion was completely legal.\n\nPalumbo thought he was following the law by offering \"bullet button\" AR-15s, guns that are modified to comply with the SAFE Act's new rules. He was more or less assured by state police:\n\nAccording to Palumbo (gun store owner), he said he had spoken with state police last year in regards to the legality of selling AR-15's with the bullet button attachment. He said police advised him that it should be \"ok\" but wouldn't guarantee him an answer until someone goes to court for it.\n\nYet, that hasn't seemed to stop the state from repeatedly checking in on him.\n\nCritics claim that exchanges such as these prove that the SAFE Act is arbitrary and confusing:\n\n\u201cThe New York S.A.F.E. Act is being enforced arbitrarily on a case by case basis,\u201d Tresmond said. \u201cThat amounts to unconstitutional vagueness under the Supreme Court\u2019s Morales standard, and the law should be enjoined for that reason alone.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the legislation's head scratching details, the SAFE Act has succeeded in turning otherwise law-abiding gun owners into criminals by turning misdemeanors like firearm possession into more serious charges. Last year, after the law's implementation, over 1,200 felonies were recorded in the state. No wonder I saw so many \"Repeal the SAFE Act\" when driving through upstate New York last month.\n\nAs a result of the continuous interruptions to his business, Palumbo intends to file a lawsuit against the state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thanks, SAFE Act..05/26/2016 18:44:43PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Thanks, SAFE Act.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - NY Gun Shop Owner Forced to Hand Over 170 Customer Records", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2014/09/03/ny-gun-shop-owner-forced-to-hand-over-170-customer-records-n1886538", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/59/6d7a5eae-402f-4fd9-904a-c65fc2116889.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Thanks, SAFE Act.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - NY Gun Shop Owner Forced to Hand Over 170 Customer Records", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2014/09/03/ny-gun-shop-owner-forced-to-hand-over-170-customer-records-n1886538", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2013/59/6d7a5eae-402f-4fd9-904a-c65fc2116889.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "NY Gun Shop Owner Forced to Hand Over 170 Customer Records , Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "The gun owner was forced to present approximately 170 sales records.\nCritics claim that exchanges such as these prove that the SAFE Act is arbitrary and confusing:\u201cThe New York S.A.F.E.\nA SWAT team raided co-owner Joe Palumbo's Albion Gun Shop without a warrant.\nThey were acting on orders from the Narcotics Enforcement Unit, who asked the shop to hand over a customer list so they could determine how many people had purchased New York SAFE Act compliant rifles.\nNo wonder I saw so many \"Repeal the SAFE Act\" when driving through upstate New York last month."}
