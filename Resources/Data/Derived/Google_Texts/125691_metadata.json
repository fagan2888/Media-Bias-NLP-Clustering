A group of protesters would seize an intersection or a block for a little while, likely because the police were otherwise occupied or couldn\u2019t be bothered or didn\u2019t want to bust heads while the cameras were watching. The ragtag band would haul out the drums and noisemakers, climb the lampposts and newspaper boxes with colorful banners, and send out an exuberant chant: \u201cThis is what democracy looks like!\u201d (Contrary to what you may have heard, smashing the Starbucks windows was not required, and not all that common.)\n\nIt\u2019s easy to snark all over that from this historical distance: If democracy looks like a noisy street party involving white people with dreadlocks dressed as sea turtles, count me out! But the philosophy behind that radical-activist moment was not nearly as naive as it might look from here, and much of the problem lies in that troublesome noun: democracy. In those post-Communist, pre-9/11 days, the era of the \u201cend of history,\u201d democracy in its liberal-capitalist formulation was assumed to be the natural fulfillment of human society. It was the essential nutrient-rich medium for the growth of all good things: Pizza Hut, parliamentary elections, knockoff designer clothes and broadband Internet, not to mention all the wonderful gizmos that were about to be invented. Even anti-capitalist protesters were compelled to embrace the rhetoric of democracy, if only to suggest (as Gandhi did about \u201cWestern civilization\u201d) that it was a great idea but we hadn\u2019t gotten there yet.\n\nA decade and a half later, democracy remains officially unopposed on the world stage, yet it faces an unexpected existential crisis. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, American-style liberal-capitalist democracy has presented itself to the world as \u201cthe only legitimate form of expression or decision-making power\u201d and \u201cthe necessary first condition of freedom.\u201d (I\u2019m quoting an anarchist critique by Moxie Marlinspike and Windy Hart, which is well worth reading.) But it has abruptly and spectacularly stopped working as advertised: The broken American political system has become a global laughingstock, and numerous other Western countries that modeled their systems on ours are in chronic crisis mode.\n\nThis is what democracy looks like: grotesque inequality, delusional Tea Party obstructionism, a vast secret national-security state, overseas wars we\u2019re never even told about and a total inability to address the global climate crisis, a failure for which our descendants will never forgive us, and never should. Maybe I\u2019ll take the turtle costumes after all. The aura of democratic legitimacy is fading fast in an era when financial and political capital are increasingly consolidated in a few thousand people, a fact we already knew but whose implications French insta-celebrity Thomas Piketty and the political scientists Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page (of the \u201coligarchy study\u201d) have forcefully driven home. Libertarian thinker Bryan Caplan sees the same pattern, as Michael Lind recently wrote in Salon, but thinks it\u2019s a good thing. In America, democracy offers the choice between one political party that has embraced a combination of corporate bootlicking, poorly veiled racism, anti-government paranoia and a wholesale rejection of science, and another whose cosmopolitan veneer sits atop secret drone warfare, Wall Street cronyism and the all-seeing Panopticon of high-tech surveillance. You don\u2019t have to conclude that noted climate-change expert Marco Rubio and Establishment mega-hawk Hillary Clinton are interchangeable or identical to conclude that it isn\u2019t much of a choice.\n\nMost critiques of democracy as it currently exists, certainly those from the liberal left, assume that democracy can and should be fixed and that it\u2019s just a matter of switching off the cat videos and doing the work. They remain inside the conceptual and ideological frame mentioned above, the idea that democracy is the only legitimate expression of politics. This has the force of religious doctrine, and in fact is far stronger than any religious doctrines to be found in the Western world. Our democracy may be stunted or corrupted or deformed by bad forces of money and power, these arguments go, but it self-evidently remains the ideal form of government, and it is our responsibility to redeem it. If only we can build a third party around Ralph Nader (that went well!), if only we can ring enough doorbells for Dennis Kucinich, if only we can persuade Elizabeth Warren to run against Hillary \u2013 you\u2019ve heard all this before. There are many versions of this strategy, some more plausible than others, but they all rest on the faith that the promised land of real democracy is out there somewhere beyond the horizon, waiting for us to reach it.\n\nAs the Italian political scientist Mario Tronti has noted, this faith in a golden future, with its implicit apology for the current state of affairs, may sound oddly familiar to those whose cultural memories extend back to the Cold War. It\u2019s exactly what defenders of the Soviet \u201cexperiment\u201d said over and over. Yes, \u201cactually existing socialism\u201d had its limitations, most of which resulted from imperialist meddling and ideological backwardness, but one day our grandchildren, or their grandchildren, would finish the task of building a communist society. That was hogwash, Tronti says, and so is the insistence that we should judge democracy based on some imaginary potential rather than what it is in practice. \u201cThis theoretical-practical knot that is democracy,\u201d he writes, \u201ccan now be judged by its results.\u201d What we see around us \u201cshould not be read as a \u2018false\u2019 democracy in the face of which there is or should be a \u2018true\u2019 democracy, but as the coming-true of the ideal, or conceptual, form of democracy.\u201d\n\nIn other words, we have to consider the possibility that the current state of American politics, with its bizarre combination of poisoned, polarized and artificially overheated debate along with total paralysis on every substantive issue and widespread apathy and discontent, is what we get after 200-odd years. It\u2019s not a detour in the history of Jeffersonian democracy but something closer to a natural outcome. We also must consider that our version of a democratic system is not, in fact, designed to reflect the will of the people (a dubious concept to begin with) but to manipulate and channel it in acceptable directions. Another Italian scholar, Luciano Canfora, argues in his magisterial history \u201cDemocracy in Europe\u201d that the extension of citizenship and voting rights to all in Western democracies arrived alongside a concerted, oligarchic program to limit \u201cthe range of the possible.\u201d He means, among other things, the manipulation of the mass media, the collapse of a wide range of political opinions down to the generic \u201cpolicy bundles\u201d of a two-party system, and the shameless gerrymandering that remains acceptable and normal in our country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From Thomas Piketty to Cliven Bundy to GOP climate trolls, democracy is in deep crisis.
