Things really took a turn when Gavin McInnes argued there\u2019s a big difference between letting girls and guys go down to enjoy spring break. He said, \u201cMy daughter, there\u2019s no way in hell she\u2019s going there, but with my sons, I hope they have a great time.\u201d\n\nWell, when Hannity asked the women on the panel if they\u2019re \u201cmad\u201d at him for saying that\u2026 well, it was a very clear majority.\n\nLater on in the show, after Bill Cunningham came to his defense, McInnes insisted there\u2019s a difference because for guys, \u201cthe worst that can happen is some guy pulls a gun on them and they lose the 40 dollars in their swim trunks,\u201d while \u201cthe biggest problem with women is rape.\u201d Jedediah Bila brought up poisoning that could affect men, and another panelist cried, \u201cWho is raping the women? It\u2019s the men!\u201d\n\nMcInnes also riled things up when he said, \u201cThe women there are human garbage whose parents don\u2019t love them.\u201d Chloe Melas fired back and told him, \u201cYou think guys only want to hang out with their boys on spring break? They want girls there too!\u201d She argued if he\u2019s really concerned about rape, he should be worried about sending guys down there too, because \u201cI don\u2019t think a girl is going to date rape me, I think a guy is going to date rape me!\u201d\n\nYou can watch the chaos unfold below, via Fox News:\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch.\n\n\n\n[photo via screengrab]\n\n\u2014 \u2014\n\nFollow Josh Feldman on Twitter: @feldmaniac", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sean Hannity brought in an in-studio audience of guests to debate spring break, and things really got explosive when Gavin McInnes said he would let his sons go", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/hannity-spring-break.jpg", "title": "\u2018Women Should Not Be There!\u2019 Hannity Spring Break Segment Turns into Fiery Shoutfest"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sean Hannity brought in an in-studio audience of guests to debate spring break, and things really got explosive when Gavin McInnes said he would let his sons go down to have a good time but prevent his daughters from going.", "title": "'Women Should Not Be There!'
