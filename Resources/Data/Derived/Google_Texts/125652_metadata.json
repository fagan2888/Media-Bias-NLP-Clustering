On December 21, 2015, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York held in In re Petrobras Securities Litigation that certain purchasers of Petrobras debt securities could not sue under the federal securities laws. In so ruling, the court held that settlements of transfers through the New York-based Depository Trust Company (the \u201cDTC\u201d) do not suffice in and of themselves to bring what would otherwise be non-U.S. transactions within the reach of the federal securities laws.\n\nThe latest decision in the Petrobras securities litigation involved claims by certain U.S. and non-U.S. purchasers of notes issued by Petrobras, a Brazilian company. All of the plaintiffs sought to assert securities-fraud claims under U.S. law. To do so, the plaintiffs needed to satisfy the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 decision in Morrison v. National Australia Bank, which held that the federal securities laws apply only to allegedly fraudulent statements made \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of [i] a security listed on an American stock exchange, and [ii] the purchase or sale of any other security in the United States.\u201d\n\nListing on U.S. Exchange . The plaintiffs argued that Morrison\u2019s first prong applied because the Petrobras notes were listed or intended to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. But regardless of the listing, the notes never actually traded on the NYSE, so the court ruled \u2013 in accordance with Second Circuit precedent \u2013 that \u201cmere listing, without trading, is insufficient to satisfy Morrison\u2019s first prong. . . . This is because the rationale of Morrison clearly focuses on the location of actual transactions, with the domestic listing acting as a proxy for a domestic transaction.\u201d The court also held that the allegation that the notes traded in the over-the-counter bond market did not satisfy Morrison\u2019s first prong, because \u201cover-the-counter transactions are, by definition, those that do not occur on an exchange.\u201d\n\nOther Domestic Transactions . Most of the court\u2019s opinion focused on Morrison\u2019s second prong: \u201cthe purchase or sale of any [unlisted] security in the United States.\u201d The Second Circuit, in its 2012 decision in Absolute Activist Value Master Fund v. Ficeto, had held that this prong is satisfied only \u201cwhen the parties incur irrevocable liability to carry out the transaction within the United States or when title is passed within the United States.\u201d The District Court therefore addressed whether the plaintiffs had incurred irrevocable liability, or whether title had passed, in the United States.\n\nThe court ruled that two U.S. plaintiffs had adequately pled facts showing the domestic incurrence of irrevocable liability: the complaint alleged that those plaintiffs\u2019 U.S.-based traders had purchased the foreign issuer\u2019s notes from U.S.-based underwriters.\n\nBut certain non-U.S. plaintiffs had merely asserted the incurrence of irrevocable liability in the United States without pleading any supporting factual allegations, despite the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling in Absolute Activist that \u201cthe mere assertion that transactions \u2018took place in the United States\u2019 is insufficient to adequately plead the existence of domestic transactions.\u201d The court therefore dismissed those plaintiffs\u2019 claims.\n\nOther non-U.S. plaintiffs had pled more specific allegations, but nevertheless failed to establish incurrence of irrevocable liability or transfer of title in the United States. For example, one U.K.-based plaintiff had allegedly instructed its U.S. affiliate in Chicago to transfer the Petrobras notes to the U.K. plaintiff. The court held that an allegation of a \u201ctransfer\u201d is not an allegation of a \u201cpurchase\u201d in the United States. \u201cMoreover, the allegations suggest that irrevocable liability was incurred in the United Kingdom, where [the plaintiffs] are both located.\u201d\n\nThose non-U.S. plaintiffs also contended that, regardless of whether they had incurred irrevocable liability in the United States, transfer of title had occurred here because beneficial ownership had been transferred through settlement through the DTC. But the court held that \u201cthe operations of the DTC are insufficient to satisfy Absolute Activist, even assuming that DTC\u2019s bookkeeping affects a change in beneficial ownership in New York.\u201d The court explained that \u201c[t]he mechanics of DTC settlements are actions needed to carry out transactions, but they involve neither the substantive indicia of a contractual commitment necessary to satisfy Absolute Activist\u2019s first prong nor the formal weight of a transfer of title necessary for its second.\u201d The court added that, \u201cif all DTC-settled transactions necessarily fell under the reach of the federal securities laws[,] [t]he laws would reach most transactions, not because they occurred on a domestic exchange but because they settled through the DTC. This result cannot be squared with the plain language and careful reasoning of Morrison and Absolute Activist.\u201d\n\nThe Petrobras decision illustrates the hurdles that purchasers of non-U.S. securities continue to face in suing under the federal securities laws. Such plaintiffs must plead specific transactional facts \u2013 not conclusory allegations \u2013 showing, at a minimum, either (i) an actual transaction on a U.S. exchange (not in the over-the-counter market) or, for non-U.S.-listed securities, (ii) the incurrence of irrevocable liability in the United States or the transfer of title in the United States. U.S.-based mechanics necessary to carry out a transaction \u2013 such as settlement through the DTC \u2013 will not suffice. Plaintiffs also need to remember the Second Circuit\u2019s 2014 warning inParkcentral Global Hub Limited v. Porsche Automobile Holdings SE that, \u201cwhile a domestic transaction or listing is necessary to state a claim under [the federal securities laws], a finding that these transactions were domestic would not suffice to compel the conclusion that the plaintiffs\u2019 invocation of [U.S. law] was appropriately domestic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The court for the Southern District of New York held re Petrobras Securities Litigation that certain purchasers of debt securities could not sue under the federal securities laws", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "The narrowing of the federal securities laws&amp;rsquo; applicability to non-U.S. transactions continues.
