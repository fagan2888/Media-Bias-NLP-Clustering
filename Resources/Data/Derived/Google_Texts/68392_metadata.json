Of the five states with the lowest unemployment rates \u2014 North Dakota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa \u2014 four of them are run by Republican governors.\n\nGOP governors also run the five states with the lowest debt per capita \u2014 Tennessee, Indiana, Wisconsin, South Dakota and Arizona, according to State Budget Solutions.\n\n\u201cRepublican governors across the country are cutting taxes, lowering spending, balancing budgets, reforming education and making their states engines of economic growth,\u201d said Jon Thompson, spokesman for the Republican Governors Association. \u201cRepublican governors are working hard to implement pro-growth, pro-business policies to make their states more competitive. And those policies have produced incredible results.\u201d\n\nFor the 10th consecutive year, Texas has been named the best state to do business in a survey of more than 500 chief executive officers, and the other nine states at the top of the list are all run by Republicans, according to the survey by ChiefExecutive.net.\n\nThe same rankings showed that four of the five worst states to do business \u2014 Massachusetts, New Jersey, California, New York and Illinois \u2014 are led by Democrats. The states were graded on tax policy, regulatory issues, the quality of the workforce and the quality of the living environment.\n\nAnd the top five spots on CNBC\u2019s annual rankings of the \u201cTop States for Business\u201d also were held by states with Republicans governors \u2014 Georgia, Texas, Utah, Nebraska and North Carolina.\n\n\u201cSome politicians just talk about creating jobs and reviving struggling economies, but Republican governors are actually doing it,\u201d New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said recently. \u201cThe result is stronger, more prosperous states that work.\u201d\n\nDemocrats counter that the GOP is peddling a false storyline and that its governors have embraced policies that have hurt the middle class.\n\n\u201cRepublican governors have prioritized tax breaks and special deals for the wealthiest and corporations and paid for them by raising middle-class taxes and gutting investments in education,\u201d said Sabrina Singh, spokeswoman for the Democratic Governors Association. \u201cThose aren\u2019t pro-growth policies \u2014 they simply shift the burden from the rich to middle-class families, seniors and students who are working hard to succeed.\u201d\n\nChris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, warned against reading too much into the role that either of the parties has played in reviving their state economies.\n\n\u201cState economic policies help drive each state\u2019s relative prosperity over the long term,\u201d Mr. Edwards said. \u201cFactors such as union laws and tax rates either repel or attract investment and entrepreneurs. However, many forces outside of state policymaker control can have a large impact, such as changes in global markets, technological breakthroughs such as fracking, and federal mandates that hit states unevenly, such as environmental rules.\u201d\n\nWhatever the case, Republicans say, they are delivering on the state level.\n\n\u201cConservative governors and their partner legislatures are enacting bold reforms, challenging entrenched special interests and enacting growth agendas that are bringing fiscal sanity back to statehouses across America,\u201d said Jill Bader, spokeswoman for the State Government Leadership Foundation, which is a strategic partner to the Republican State Leadership Committee.\n\nOf the 36 gubernatorial races in November, six of the 10 considered tossups, including Florida and Wisconsin, are now controlled by Republicans. Election analysts predict Republicans will easily hold 23 of their seats and that Democrats have a handle on 17. They also say the gubernatorial races arguably could be more important than the battle for control of the U.S. Senate because of the ongoing debates at the state level over taxes, voting rights and the expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare.\n\nWith that as a backdrop, Mr. Christie, one of several governors eyeing presidential runs, has raised boatloads of cash. RGA officials have vowed to spend $100 million over the final 100 days of the campaign, as it looks to protect some of its most vulnerable governors, including Govs. Paul LePage of Maine, Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania and Rick Scott of Florida.\n\nRepublicans hope the dissatisfaction with the Obama administration, combined with signs of improving state economies, will strengthen their electoral hand.\n\nAlong those lines, the RGA has touted how Florida\u2019s unemployment rate has dropped 5 percentage points on Mr. Scott\u2019s watch, 2 percentage points under Mr. LePage in Maine and more than 2 percentage points under Mr. Corbett in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe dip in unemployment rates has put Democrats running against GOP incumbents in a bit of a bind because they are trying to downplay the same news on the jobs front that President Obama and Congressional Democrats are touting as a success story.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are cross-pressured on the economy,\u201d said Darrell West, of the left-leaning Brooking Institution. \u201cNationally, they want to emphasize the sharp reduction in unemployment and [credit Obama\u2019s policies]. Yet in key states, Democratic challengers point toward poor performance by GOP governors and argue their policies aren\u2019t working. It is hard for both arguments to be successful.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Heading into the 2014 election, the GOP is casting its slate of governors as turnaround artists, saying they've led their states out of recession by embracing lower taxes, putting people back to work and ensuring businesses are helped \u2014 not hampered \u2014 by their policies.", "Author": "Seth McLaughlin", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Heading into the 2014 election, the GOP is casting its slate of governors as turnaround artists, saying they\u2019ve led their states out of recession by embracing lower taxes, putting people back to work and ensuring businesses are helped \u2014 not hampered \u2014 by their policies.", "title": "GOP 2014: Republican governors cite their economic stewardship", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jul/27/gop-2014-republican-governors-cite-their-economic-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/27/7_272014_ap9069623277198201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/27/7_272014_ap9069623277198201.jpg", "title": "GOP 2014: Republican governors cite their economic stewardship", "description": "Heading into the 2014 election, the GOP is casting its slate of governors as turnaround artists, saying they've led their states out of recession by embracing lower taxes, putting people back to work", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Republican Party, Republican Governors Association"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0232\"", "article_summary": "\u201cRepublican governors across the country are cutting taxes, lowering spending, balancing budgets, reforming education and making their states engines of economic growth,\u201d said Jon Thompson, spokesman for the Republican Governors Association.\n\u201cSome politicians just talk about creating jobs and reviving struggling economies, but Republican governors are actually doing it,\u201d New Jersey Gov.\nOf the five states with the lowest unemployment rates \u2014 North Dakota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa \u2014 four of them are run by Republican governors.\nChris Christie, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said recently.\n\u201cRepublican governors are working hard to implement pro-growth, pro-business policies to make their states more competitive."}
