He also interviewed with the Eagles, Browns and Giants and had been considered the front-runner for the Dolphins job.\n\nThe Dolphins chose him after interviewing six other candidates.\n\n\u201cWe did exhaustive research on all of the candidates ahead of time, and conducted thorough and detailed interviews with each person,\u201d owner Stephen Ross said in a statement. \u201cIn the end I was convinced, and the search committee was unanimous \u2014 Adam was the right leader for our football team who best met all of our priorities. He has high energy, is competitive and driven to win, with a mindset of teaching and developing players.\u201d\n\nAn introductory news conference was scheduled for Saturday.\n\nGase has no head coaching experience but has been a target of NFL coaching searches for at least three years. A year ago he followed coach John Fox from Denver to Chicago after interviewing for head jobs with the Bears, Bills and Falcons.\n\nGase is a protege of former Dolphins coach Nick Saban and has won favorable reviews for his work with a range of quarterback talent \u2014 from Peyton Manning to Jay Cutler to Tim Tebow. In Miami, he\u2019ll try to help Ryan Tannehill, who is 29-35 in four years as a starter and regressed in 2015, when the Dolphins finished 6-10.\n\nExecutive vice president of football operations Mike Tannenbaum, who led the job search, had success while with the Jets hiring first-time NFL head coaches Eric Mangini and Rex Ryan. That approach hasn\u2019t worked with the coaching carousel in Miami, where none of Gase\u2019s eight most recent predecessors had previous NFL head coaching experience.\n\nLike Gase, the Dolphins\u2019 three most recent offseason hires were assistants \u2014 Cam Cameron, Tony Sparano and Joe Philbin.\n\nMiami did interview former head coaches Mike Shanahan, Mike Smith and Doug Marrone this week. Others interviewed included Dolphins interim coach, Dan Campbell; Lions defensive coordinator Teryl Austin; and Bills running backs coach and assistant head coach Anthony Lynn.\n\nBut from the start, there was a buzz about Gase. During his single season with the Bears, they won only six games and ranked 17th in offensive points, but he helped Cutler reduce his turnovers and post a career-high passer rating of 92.3.\n\nGase spent six seasons on the staff in Denver, where he helped Tebow win a playoff game. In his first season as offensive coordinator in 2013, Manning and the Broncos scored an NFL record 606 points and reached the Super Bowl. The following year they scored 482 points, the league\u2019s second-highest total.\n\nA native of Ypsilanti, Michigan, Gase worked on the staff of Michigan State coach Nick Saban while a student there. He followed Saban to LSU and was a graduate assistant and recruiting assistant before beginning his NFL career in 2003.\n\nSaban coached the Dolphins in 2005-06. He\u2019s one of their eight coaches since their most recent playoff victory in 2000.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Bears coordinator Adam Gase hired as Dolphins coach", "title": "Bears coordinator Adam Gase hired as Dolphins coach", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/09/bears-coordinator-adam-gase-hired-as-dolphins-coach/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160108__gasep1-1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160108__gasep1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-09T12:22:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:18:58+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Others interviewed included Dolphins interim coach, Dan Campbell; Lions defensive coordinator Teryl Austin; and Bills running backs coach and assistant head coach Anthony Lynn.\nMIAMI \u2014 Chicago Bears offensive coordinator Adam Gase was hired Saturday as the Miami Dolphins\u2019 ninth coach since 2004, and he\u2019ll try to end the team\u2019s seven-year playoff drought.\nGase has no head coaching experience but has been a target of NFL coaching searches for at least three years.\nA native of Ypsilanti, Michigan, Gase worked on the staff of Michigan State coach Nick Saban while a student there.\nThat approach hasn\u2019t worked with the coaching carousel in Miami, where none of Gase\u2019s eight most recent predecessors had previous NFL head coaching experience."}
