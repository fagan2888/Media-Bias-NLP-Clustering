These are questions that concern philosophers, psychologists, politicians, neuroscientists, managers, economists, activists and doctors alike. How one sets about answering such questions will depend heavily on what sorts of theories and interpretations one employs. A sociologist will offer different types of answers from a neuroscientist, who will offer different types of answers again from a psychoanalyst. The question of how we explain and respond to human unhappiness is ultimately an ethical and political one, of where we choose to focus our critique and, to be blunt about it, where we intend to level the blame.\n\nTreating the mind (or brain) as some form of decontextualized, independent entity that breaks down of its own accord, requiring monitoring and fixing by experts, is a symptom of the very culture that produces a great deal of unhappiness today. Disempowerment is an integral part of how depression, stress and anxiety arise. And despite the best efforts of positive psychologists, disempowerment occurs as an effect of social, political and economic institutions and strategies, not of neural or behavioral errors. To deny this is to exacerbate the problem for which happiness science claims to be the solution.\n\nBeyond the various behaviorist and utilitarian disciplines that have been explored in this book, there are a number of research traditions that share this focus on disempowerment. The community psychology tradition, which emerged in the United States during the 1960s, insists that individuals can only be understood within their social contexts. Clinical psychologists have been among the most outspoken critics of the medicalization of distress, and the role of the pharmaceutical companies in encouraging it. Allied to a critique of capitalism, these psychologists \u2013 such as David Smail and Mark Rapley in the UK \u2013 have offered alternative interpretations of psychiatric symptoms, based on a more sociological and political understanding of unhappiness. Social epidemiology, as practiced by Carles Muntaner in Canada or Richard Wilkinson in the UK, tries to understand how mental disorders vary across different societies and different social classes, correlating with different socioeconomic conditions.\n\nAt each point in the history of happiness measurement, from the Enlightenment through to the present, hopes for a different social and economic world flicker into view, as unhappiness becomes a basis to challenge the status quo. Understanding the strains and pains that work, hierarchy, financial pressures and inequality place upon human well-being is a first step to challenging those things. This emancipatory spirit flips swiftly into a conservative one, once the same body of evidence is used as a basis to judge the behavior and mentality of people, rather than the structure of power. Hope is not so much dashed as ensnared. Critique is turned inwards. This is not necessarily how things have to be.\n\nOnce the critical eye is turned upon institutions, and away from the emotion or mood of the individual who inhabits them, things start to look very different indeed. Among wealthy nations, the rate of mental illness correlates very closely to the level of economic inequality across society as a whole, with the United States at the top. The nature and availability of work plays a crucial role in influencing mental well-being, as do organizational structures and managerial practices. One of the most important findings in happiness economics is that unemployment exerts a far more negative effect on people psychologically than the mere loss of earnings would suggest.\n\nMeanwhile, types of work where individuals have no \u2018skill discretion\u2019 or \u2018decision authority\u2019 have been repeatedly found to trigger the release of cortisol into the blood, which leads to hardening of arteries and heightened risk of heart disease. It is scarcely surprising that employee well-being is higher in employee-owned companies, where decision-making is more participatory and authority more distributed, than in regular, shareholder-owned firms. In their extensive analysis of how recessions affect public health, David Stuckler and Sanjay Basu demonstrate the precise ways in which austerity policies have led to deteriorating mental and physical health, and unnecessary deaths. They also indicate alternatives in which recessions can be an opportunity for improvements in public health. Which route is chosen is ultimately a political question.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If we want to live in a way that is psychologically happy, we need to rethink the very nature of our economy", "title": "We are all just rats in a cage: How the 1 percent profits from your misery", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "If we want to live in a way that is psychologically happy, we need to rethink the very nature of our economy", "title": "We are all just rats in a cage: How the 1 percent profits from your misery", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/10/we_are_all_just_rats_in_a_cage_how_the_1_percent_profits_from_your_misery/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/office_space3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If we want to live in a way that is psychologically happy, we need to rethink the very nature of our economy", "title": "We are all just rats in a cage: How the 1 percent profits from your misery", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/office_space3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "William Davies", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Austerity, Books, Editor's Picks, excerpts, Happiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e4a\"", "article_summary": "A sociologist will offer different types of answers from a neuroscientist, who will offer different types of answers again from a psychoanalyst.\nThe nature and availability of work plays a crucial role in influencing mental well-being, as do organizational structures and managerial practices.\nAnd despite the best efforts of positive psychologists, disempowerment occurs as an effect of social, political and economic institutions and strategies, not of neural or behavioral errors.\nHow one sets about answering such questions will depend heavily on what sorts of theories and interpretations one employs.\nSocial epidemiology, as practiced by Carles Muntaner in Canada or Richard Wilkinson in the UK, tries to understand how mental disorders vary across different societies and different social classes, correlating with different socioeconomic conditions."}
