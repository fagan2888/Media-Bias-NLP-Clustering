He said he wanted to scale up work in its least developed countries, make southeastern Europe a focus and continue investing in Ukraine and Kazakhstan.\n\n\"We should be clearer in our country strategies about what more we could do in a country of operation if political and economic reform went further,\" he said, calling it \"a more-for-more agenda\".\n\nIn recent years, the EBRD has expanded its reach beyond eastern Europe and ex-Soviet central Asia to include Mongolia, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan.\n\nUnder Chakrabarti's tenure it has also added euro zone crisis countries Greece and Cyprus and launched a plan to help countries dealing with the fallout of the Syrian refugee crisis.\n\nIt has been a challenging period. The bank has done no new lending in Russia, traditionally its biggest market, for the last two years because of Western sanctions on Moscow over Ukraine, and in 2014 made its first loss since the height of the financial crisis.\n\nChakrabarti said the bank needed to maintain \"engagement\" with Moscow, while Belka also referred to the chill in East-West relations.\n\n\"The dream of the 'founding fathers' of the EBRD about a democratic, more stable, united and prosperous Europe has now receded a bit further beyond the horizon,\" Belka said.\n\n(Reporting by Marc Jones; editing by Andrew Roche)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - The two candidates hoping to head the European Bank for Reconstruct", "title": "Battle lines drawn in EBRD election race", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/04/Battle-lines-drawn-EBRD-election-race", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ebrd-politics_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/04/Battle-lines-drawn-EBRD-election-race", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/ebrd-politics_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "LONDON (Reuters) - The two candidates hoping to head the European Bank for Reconstruct", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\"Electing a representative of a country of operation as EBRD President will be a clear sign of recognizing our joint success,\" Belka said in letter published on the bank's website.\nChakrabarti said the bank needed to maintain \"engagement\" with Moscow, while Belka also referred to the chill in East-West relations.\nIn recent years, the EBRD has expanded its reach beyond eastern Europe and ex-Soviet central Asia to include Mongolia, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan.\n\"The dream of the 'founding fathers' of the EBRD about a democratic, more stable, united and prosperous Europe has now receded a bit further beyond the horizon,\" Belka said.\nHe said he wanted to scale up work in its least developed countries, make southeastern Europe a focus and continue investing in Ukraine and Kazakhstan."}
