(Benefits can only be changed during the year if there is a qualifying life event \u2013 the birth of a baby, an adoption, marriage or divorce \u2013 or a change in employment status.)\n\nA variety of charts and publications designed to help employees and their families make the decision can be found in Open Enrollment materials, including Selecting Your Stanford Health Plan: A Quick Guide; Faculty Benefits Summary; Staff Benefits Summary; and the Employee Newsletter.\n\nIn a recent interview with Stanford Report, Les Schlaegel, associate vice president for benefits, answered questions about the new SHCA plan and other changes the university is making to its medical care offerings in 2014.\n\nWhat stays the same in 2014?\n\nStanford will continue to offer the Kaiser Permanente HMO, the Blue Shield EPO and PPO and the High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP).\n\nDelta Dental remains our dental care provider with two plan options. Vision Service Plan (VSP), which will remain our vision plan provider, will add a new benefit: VSP members \u2013 and up to four dependents \u2013 will be offered a TruHearing discount program for hearing aids at a reduced cost.\n\nEmployees who complete four steps of the BeWell Employee Incentive Program \u2013 the Stanford Health and Lifestyle Assessment (SHALA), the Wellness Profile, enrollment in a Stanford-sponsored medical plan in 2014, and agreement to share SHALA and health screening information \u2013 by Nov. 30, 2013 will be eligible for a $480 taxable incentive ($20 per pay period) on medical plan premiums in 2014.\n\nEmployees participating in the BeWell Program for the first time in 2014 can earn a $200 taxable incentive by completing two steps \u2013 the SHALA and the Wellness Profile \u2013 by Nov. 30, 2013. This incentive also is available for returning participants who have elected not to share their information or are not enrolled in a Stanford medical plan.\n\nStanford also continues to offer discounts for fitness classes offered under the Stanford School of Medicine's Health Improvement Program.\n\nWhat is the Stanford HealthCare Alliance?\n\nStanford Hospital & Clinics created the Stanford HealthCare Alliance (SHCA) to offer another low-cost, high-quality health care plan to employees and postdoctoral scholars. The new plan is priced identically to Kaiser.\n\nStanford HealthCare Alliance is a select network health plan in which physicians at several Bay Area hospitals \u2013 including Stanford Hospital & Clinics and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital \u2013 and physicians' groups and affiliated doctors in multiple specialties work together to carefully coordinate and deliver care. So far, 300 primary care physicians and 2,300 specialists have joined the alliance, which is expected to grow.\n\nFor up-to-date information on the hospitals, clinics and doctors in the SHCA network, call a member care specialist at (855) 345-SHCA (7422) or visit the website. It's really important that employees call for information, because the alliance is adding doctors every week. The member care specialists are trained to help employees find primary care physicians tailored to their particular needs.\n\nAs an SHCA member, an employee must designate a primary care physician and use the physicians and facilities within the SHCA network. Your primary care physician will coordinate all of your care throughout the network.\n\nSome Bay Area hospitals and physicians' groups are not part of the SHCA network: Palo Alto Medical Foundation, Washington Hospital (Fremont) and Valley Medical Center in San Jose.\n\nWe recognize that employees will be concerned when they see the increases in premiums and copayments in existing health care plans. We hope they will consider the SHCA as a low-cost, high-quality alternative.\n\nAre premiums increasing for Kaiser, Blue Shield and the HDHP plans?\n\nWhile Kaiser remains free for an individual employee, premiums for all other Kaiser coverage categories \u2013 employee and spouse, employee and child, employee and family \u2013 are going up 13 percent.\n\nUnder the Blue Shield EPO, the premium for an individual is rising 20 percent; all other coverage categories are rising 17 percent.\n\nUnder the Blue Shield PPO, the premium for an individual is rising 24 percent; all other coverage categories are rising 20 percent.\n\nUnder the HDHP, the premium for an individual is rising 40 percent; all other coverage categories are rising 24 percent.\n\nWhat about copayments?\n\nCopayments to see a specialist will increase to $50, from $35, for the Blue Shield EPO and PPO plans, and a $50 copay will be added under the Kaiser plan to see a specialist.\n\nBlue Shield EPO and Kaiser members will be charged copays of $100 for emergency room visits, but the fee will be waived if the individual is admitted to the hospital.\n\nDetailed information about medical plan, dental and vision costs for full-time and part-time employees is available on the benefits website.\n\nWhat factors are affecting the rise in health-related costs in general?\n\nThere are many factors that drive health care costs, including the cost of developing new drugs and medical technologies and treatments, and inappropriate utilization of health care services \u2013 such as unnecessary trips to the emergency room for medical issues that could be handled in an urgent care center.\n\nObesity and other related diseases \u2013 including diabetes, hypertension, health disease and strokes \u2013 are on the rise. Because those conditions are so damaging to one's health and require ongoing care, they also become very expensive to treat. Those expenses are not simply passed along to the individuals affected by those conditions, but are distributed to everyone in the form of higher health costs. At Stanford, we are experiencing these same realities.\n\nWhat factors are affecting the rise in health-related costs at Stanford?\n\nThe average age of a benefits-eligible employee at Stanford is 47, so we're seeing an increase in disease related to an aging population, such as cancer.\n\nAdvances in medicines to treat diseases like cancer are more effective than ever before, but they're also more expensive. In fact, Stanford's cost per participant for health care has increased between 9 and 13 percent per year on average between 2002 and 2012.\n\nA significant jump in 2012 in the number of claims that cost more than $200,000 also contributed to the increase in health plan rates.\n\nWe want to ensure that our faculty and staff are as healthy as possible and continue to have access to world-class health care. At the same time, we're no different from other employers who are affected by rising costs of health care.\n\nThis year, Stanford is projected to spend $139 million for health care, compared with $71 million in 2007.\n\nThree of Stanford's health care plans \u2013 Blue Shield EPO and PPO, and the HDHC \u2013 are self-funded. When claims are filed, Stanford writes checks to the providers.\n\nEmployees enrolled in Kaiser can take advantage of the Kaiser Mobile Health Vehicle, which makes regular visits to campus and to SLAC. Is there a similar option for members of the other Stanford-sponsored health plans?\n\nStanford recently opened the Stanford Express Care clinic on the second floor of Hoover Pavilion. The clinic provides care to patients of all ages for non-emergency medical conditions that require timely treatment. Its staff can treat minor ailments, including respiratory illnesses, colds, flu, abdominal pain, fever, headaches and back pain, as well as minor injuries, such as cuts, sprains and fractures. The clinic, which is open weekdays from 10 am. to 7 p.m., takes same-day and next-day appointments.\n\nAdditionally, Stanford Coordinated Care, which is part of Stanford Hospital & Clinics, is a benefit available to active university and hospital employees and their adult dependents covered by Blue Shield. At its clinic, located in Hoover Pavilion, a team of medical experts helps people with chronic conditions lead a healthy life and smoothly navigate their health care experiences.\n\nWould some Stanford employees benefit by shopping for health care plans on the Covered California exchange, which was established under the Affordable Care Act?\n\nEmployees should consider all their options. However, since Stanford's plans meet all the criteria required by the federal government under the Affordable Care Act, employees generally will not be eligible for the tax breaks or federal subsidies offered under the legislation. When employees see the cost of plans on Covered California, they will realize that Stanford's plans are actually competitively priced.\n\nWhere can employees find out more about Stanford's 2014 health care plans?\n\nIn addition to visiting the Open Enrollment website, employees are encouraged to attend a Benefits and Retirement Savings Fair (four are scheduled) and any of the 15 Open Enrollment presentations (online or in person) to make well-informed decisions during Open Enrollment. The schedule can found on the 2014 Open Enrollment Meeting Calendar.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The benefits department in University Human Resources has prepared a variety of charts and publications designed to help employees and their families choose medical, dental and vision plans for 2014.", "og": {"url": "http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/october/healthplan-open-enrollment-101613.html", "site_name": "Stanford University", "type": "article", "description": "The benefits department in University Human Resources has prepared a variety of charts and publications designed to help employees and their families choose medical, dental and vision plans for 2014.", "title": "Stanford adds new low-cost medical plan to 2014 health care offerings"}, "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-16", "fb": {"app_id": 100291490022087}, "publication_date": "2013-10-16", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Stanford Hospital & Clinics created the Stanford HealthCare Alliance (SHCA) to offer another low-cost, high-quality health care plan to employees and postdoctoral scholars.\nWould some Stanford employees benefit by shopping for health care plans on the Covered California exchange, which was established under the Affordable Care Act?\nThis incentive also is available for returning participants who have elected not to share their information or are not enrolled in a Stanford medical plan.\nOpen Enrollment, which begins Oct. 28, is the once-a-year opportunity to change health care plans and to add or drop eligible dependents from coverage.\nAt the same time, we're no different from other employers who are affected by rising costs of health care."}
