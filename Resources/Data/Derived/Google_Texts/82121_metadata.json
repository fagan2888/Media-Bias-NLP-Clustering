The Koch brothers\u2019 political machine has been marshalling \u201cdark money\u201d used to lead the charge to shrink the size of government, to roll back taxes, to cut regulations, and to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHaworth is also the Chairman Emeritus of his family\u2019s office furniture company, Haworth Inc. Founded by his father in 1948, the family-owned company has more than 7,000 employees and is the third-largest office furniture manufacturer in the United States. Dick Haworth ran the business for more than three decades until his retirement in 2009.\n\nWhile being a leading political supporter of smaller government, Haworth, the business man, was busy soliciting U.S. government contracts. The company continues to be one of the leading suppliers of office systems and furniture to the Defense Department, General Services Administration, and other government agencies.\n\nIn fiscal year 2009, the year of Dick Haworth\u2019s retirement, Haworth Inc. sold $76.3 million worth of office systems and furniture to the federal government, representing 6.9 percent of the company\u2019s total sales. In the four years since Haworth\u2019s retirement, his company has landed federal government contracts worth an additional $176 million, representing 3.3 percent of the company\u2019s total sales during the four-year period.\n\nDick Haworth\u2019s appearance at the latest Koch-hosted retreat in January was reported by Mother Jones, which obtained a list of the elite guests, after it was mistakenly left by one of the participants in the lobby of the exclusive Renaissance Esmeralda resort located outside Palm Springs, California.\n\nDick Haworth is a also member of the board of trustees of Michigan\u2019s Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a conservative free-market think tank that is a leader in anti-union \u201cright-to-work\u201d advocacy. The Mackinac Center also is a strong supporter of limited government. Its website says,\u201d We look forward to the day when the myths and fears of free-market capitalism are dispelled, along with the misplaced faith in a benevolent, omnipotent state.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a lucky thing for Dick Haworth and his corporate colleagues that the federal government is so benevolent \u2013 most customers wouldn\u2019t look so kindly on a major supplier who was actively working to shrink their size and influence.\n\n(Visited 55 times, 1 visits today)", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Center For Effective Government", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://www.foreffectivegov.org/blog/anti-government-koch-donor-landed-more-100-million-federal-contracts/", "article_author_name": "Scott Klinger", "image": "/wp-content/uploads/files/haworth.jpg", "site_id": "adadb41eceea17d97ebcbdb90614b04b", "article_published_time": "2014-02-19T12:08:34+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-03-25T20:39:03+00:00", "keywords": "article, federal contractor, koch industries, revenue & spending", "wp_version": "7.6.2.2"}, "description": "Richard \u201cDick\u201d Haworth is a frequent guest at the semi-annual retreats hosted by Charles and David Koch honoring those who have given more than a million dollars to conservative causes.
