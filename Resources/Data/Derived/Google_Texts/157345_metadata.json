It boosted the monthly premium from $322.26 to $345.40 for that individual.\n\nThe new taxes and fees include a 2 percent levy on every health plan, which is expected to net about $8 billion for the government in 2014 and increase to $14.3 billion in 2018.\n\nThere\u2019s also a $2 fee per policy that goes into a new medical-research trust fund called the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute.\n\nInsurers pay a 3.5 percent user fee to sell medical plans on the HealthCare.gov Web site.\n\nObamaCare supporters argue that federal subsidies for many low-income Americans will not only cover the taxes, but pay a big chunk of the premiums.\n\nBut ObamaCare taxes don\u2019t stop with health-plan premiums.\n\nAmericans also will pay hidden taxes, such as the 2.3 percent medical-device tax that will inflate the cost of items such as pacemakers, stents and prosthetic limbs.\n\nThose with high out-of-pocket medical expenses also will get smaller income-tax deductions.\n\nAmericans are currently allowed to deduct expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of their annual income. The threshold jumps to 10 percent under ObamaCare, costing taxpayers about $15 billion over 10 years.\n\nThen there\u2019s the new Medicare tax.\n\nUnder ObamaCare, individual tax filers earning more than $200,000 and families earning more than $250,000 will pay an added 0.9 percent Medicare surtax on top of the existing 1.45 percent Medicare payroll tax. They\u2019ll also pay an extra 3.8 percent Medicare tax on unearned income, such as investment dividends, rental income and capital gains.\n\nMeanwhile, the Obama administration touted a surge of more than 2 million visitors Monday at HealthCare.gov, plus about 250,000 calls to ObamaCare call centers.\n\n\u201cVolumes remain high but not equal to [Monday] and we have not had to deploy our queuing system on the site,\u201d said Julie Bataille, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, referring to a virtual waiting room that is activated when the site is overloaded.\n\n\u201cWe are taking thousands of calls at our call centers, which remain open until midnight, and we are seeing thousands of visitors complete enrollment online,\u201d she said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t smooth sailing for everyone on the troubled site.\n\nSoftware techie Jeff Karaaro tweeted in frustration: \u201cGot three different codes trying to submit plan choices.
