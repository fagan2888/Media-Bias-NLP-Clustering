According to Rensi, robots exist that are able to do the same jobs as a human, for a much lower cost.\n\n\u201cI was at the National Restaurant Show yesterday and if you look at the robotic devices that are coming into the restaurant industry -- it\u2019s cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who\u2019s inefficient making $15 an hour bagging French fries -- it\u2019s nonsense and it\u2019s very destructive and it\u2019s inflationary and it\u2019s going to cause a job loss across this country like you\u2019re not going to believe,\u201d said former McDonald\u2019s (MCD) USA CEO Ed Rensi during an interview on the FOX Business Network\u2019s Mornings with Maria.\n\nHere's an example of a robot that can build a hamburger:\n\nRensi did, however, argue for a staggered minimum wage--one for high school-age students and one for other entry-level workers.\n\nHe's completely right. Kiosks are cheaper and more accurate than humans, and they're starting to creep their way into the food industry. Setting a wage at $15/hour (or any other arbitrarily high figure) will not help low-skilled workers--it will just shut them out of a job.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Minimum wage issues. .05/27/2016 11:30:27AM EST.", "author": "Christine Rousselle", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Minimum wage issues.", "title": "Former McDonald's CEO: Robots Are Cheaper Than People at $15/Hour", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/05/25/former-mcdonalds-ceo-robots-are-cheaper-than-people-at-15hour-n2168508", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/110/accf2119-3a93-4d87-8cd1-b30d250ef820.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Minimum wage issues.", "title": "Former McDonald's CEO: Robots Are Cheaper Than People at $15/Hour", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/christinerousselle/2016/05/25/former-mcdonalds-ceo-robots-are-cheaper-than-people-at-15hour-n2168508", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/110/accf2119-3a93-4d87-8cd1-b30d250ef820.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Former McDonald's CEO: Robots Are Cheaper Than People at $15/Hour, Christine Rousselle, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "A former McDonald's CEO had some harsh words for proponents of the #FightFor15: Robots are a heck of a lot cheaper and accurate than you are.\nAccording to Rensi, robots exist that are able to do the same jobs as a human, for a much lower cost.\nSpeaking on Fox Business Network, former CEO Ed Rensi said that the fight for a $15/hour wage was \"nonsense\" and was going to come at the cost of jobs around the country.\nKiosks are cheaper and more accurate than humans, and they're starting to creep their way into the food industry.\nSetting a wage at $15/hour (or any other arbitrarily high figure) will not help low-skilled workers--it will just shut them out of a job."}
