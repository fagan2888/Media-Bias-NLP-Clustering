I wanted to write this Tuesday morning, after I saw what happened in the Iowa caucuses. I wanted to sit down at the keyboard and, in a stream of consciousness worthy of James Joyce, express my belief that the acid test for the GOP would be the way it deals with immigration. I wanted to make some grand pronouncements about "amnesty" and "Muslims" and "Mexican rapists and murderers" and how this Zika scare is going to impact the election.
