Jay Leno made a surprise return to “The Tonight Show” stage with a little help from Jimmy Fallon. The bit was set up with Fallon claiming that he thought he pulled a muscle on his last joke and needed some help, reports Fox News Insider.

His ‘intro‘ for Leno:

“Of course, here at ‘The Tonight Show,’ the monologue must go on. I think I’m gonna sub out. Can someone tag in for me please?”

From what appears to be the audience, Jay Leno approaches Fallon and “tags in.” Leno was greeted with a swell of applause, cheering and whistling.

For his part of the monologue, Leno took shots at 2016 presidential candidates, Obamacare and the economy, with the last topic including some input from Fallon.

A few highlights:

2016 Presidential Candidates

“Ralph Nader called Hillary Clinton a corporatist and a militarist. Isn’t that unbelievable? Ralph Nader is still alive? He [Marco Rubio] is not the only Hispanic running. No, no. Senõr Jeb Bush is also running. But as Jimmy mentioned, Bernie Sanders is getting a lot of traction. In fact, if Bernie Sanders wins, he’ll be the first socialist elected president since 2008. Just something to think about.”

Obamacare

“I like Obamacare. The problem with Obamacare is there are too many government agencies under the Obamacare umbrella. Like, I got a prostate exam the other day, but it was done by a drone and that made me feel a little uncomfortable.”

The Economy

“The economy is so bad, in California parents in Beverly Hills are being forced to raise their own children. That never happens! It is so bad even the Kardashians are losing their a**. (Fallon) The economy is so bad 50 Cent just changed his name to Nickelback. (Fallon) The economy is so bad Hillary Clinton wants people to look through her deleted emails to see if there’s any from that Nigerian prince.”

The L.A. Times reports that Leno has praised his successor, Jimmy Fallon’s, skills on “The Tonight Show,”:

“Jimmy’s doing a great job, and he brings elements to the show I never did, [like] the viral videos,” he said.

Luckily for his fans, Leno isn’t done with the small screen. He’s doing “Jay Leno’s Garage” for CNBC, which is an extension of Leno’s YouTube series of the same name, according to the L.A. Times.
