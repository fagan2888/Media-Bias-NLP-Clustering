This distinction uniquely identifies the country\u2019s best healthcare institutions based on robust, evidence-based criteria of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe 100 SafeCare Hospitals is based upon the SafeCare framework of three criteria domains \u2013 quality, patient safety and efficiency of care.

Just five hospitals under 100 beds in Texas, including USMD Hospital at Arlington, made the list.

The distinguished medical and legal experts who designed, developed, and implemented the Affordable Care Act believed that a listing of outperforming hospitals in the areas of Hospital Value Based Program (HVBP), Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), and Hospital-Acquired Conditions Reduction Program (HACRP) would promote strong incentives to improve care. The SafeCare Group adopted this framework for the 100 SafeCare Hospitals\u00ae methodology and created three criteria domains \u2013 \u201cProcesses of Care\u201d, \u201cOutcomes of Care\u201d, and \u201cEfficacy of Care.\u201d As a result, the 100 SafeCare Hospitals\u00ae utilized a methodology that is firmly rooted and grounded on nationally recognized, evidence-based metrics and data.\n\nAbout The SafeCare Group\n\nThe SafeCare Group\u00ae (www.safecaregroup.com) was founded in 2010 to help hospitals excel in the areas of Patient Safety, Quality, and Efficiency through best-in-class PQE software, high quality people and value-added services. The SafeCare Group created and published the CAUTI Bundle (used internationally), and the \u201cI AM FOR SAFETY\u201d 12-point Surgical Checklist as required by the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid, as well as several checklists to avoid hospital falls and decubitus ulcers. The SafeCare Group suite of software helps hospitals improve HVBP, HRRP and HACRP, and keeps hospitals compliant with regulatory standards. The SafeCare Group published its first 100 SafeCare Hospitals\u00ae listing with the 2013 100 SafeCare Hospitals\u00ae to recognize hospitals that excel in evidence-based areas that are required under the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "USMD Hospital at Arlington has been selected to The SafeCare Group&rsquo;s &ldquo;100 SafeCare Hospitals Under 100 Beds&rdquo; 2014 list.", "og": {"image": {"width": 465, "identifier": "http://www.businesswire.com/images/bwlogo_square.png", "type": "image/png", "height": 225}}, "twitter": {"description": "USMD Hospital at Arlington has been selected to The SafeCare Group&rsquo;s &ldquo;100 SafeCare Hospitals Under 100 Beds&rdquo; 2014 list.", "title": "USMD Hospital at Arlington Named One of 100 Safest Hospitals Under 100 Beds in U.S.", "image": {"src": "http://mms.businesswire.com/media/20150226005109/en/454850/21/USMD_Health_System.jpg"}, "site": "@businesswire", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "DC.date.issued": "2015-02-26", "p": {"domain_verify": "95725e0359a14c2e1ccbd936e10d20d6"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1986\"", "article_summary": "Only the 100 hospitals under 100 beds with the highest scores made the 100 SafeCare Hospitals\u00ae Under 100 Beds list.\nThe SafeCare Group published its first 100 SafeCare Hospitals\u00ae listing with the 2013 100 SafeCare Hospitals\u00ae to recognize hospitals that excel in evidence-based areas that are required under the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cUSMD Hospital at Arlington is honored to be recognized by The SafeCare Group as one of the safest hospitals in America,\u201d said Marcia Crim, Chief Executive Officer, USMD Hospital at Arlington.\nJust five hospitals under 100 beds in Texas, including USMD Hospital at Arlington, made the list.\nUSMD Hospital at Arlington is the only hospital in the DFW Metroplex and the top hospital in Texas to make the list."}
