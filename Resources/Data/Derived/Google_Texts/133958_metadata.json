It will feature two new breeds and a bigger lineup of dogs in an agility contest, which brought new dimension to the show last year and marked the return of mixed-breed dogs for the first time since its early years.\n\nEmma will face much older handlers and show a dog more than twice her weight \u2014 so big that Emma has to lift hard to position the legs of the Dane, named Joy. But Emma\u2019s used to the double-takes and unfazed by the competition.\n\n\u201cWith Joy, she\u2019s easy \u2014 most of the time,\u201d Emma said Wednesday after appearing at a news conference with her twin sister Faith and 17-year-old sister, Sophia, who also are showing dogs at Westminster. The Columbus, N.J., family\u2019s pastime started with a suggestion from Joy\u2019s breeder, and mom Kim Rogers soon came to see the benefits: \u201cIt teaches responsibility and winning and losing gracefully,\u201d she says.\n\nMore than 2,700 dogs are slated to compete in the traditional main event \u2014 breed judging \u2014 at Westminster\u2019s 139th annual show Feb. 16 and 17. Making their first appearances are the coton de tulear (pronounced koh-TOHN\u2019 du TOO\u2019-lay-ahr), an easygoing companion breed known as the \u201croyal dog of Madagascar,\u201d and the wirehaired vizsla (pronounced (VEEZ\u2019-shlah), a stalwart Hungarian hunting dog. It\u2019s related to the more widely known vizsla.\n\nThere are only about 2,000 wirehaired vizslas worldwide, said owner Anton Sagh, whose dog Falko is entered at Westminster.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m trying to promote the breed,\u201d said Sagh, a Hungarian-Canadian of the Montreal suburb of Laval.\n\nFor the first time, the agility competition and noncompetitive \u201cMeet the Breeds\u201d event will be held jointly. The latter used to be held in the fall.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Westminster dog show will have 2 new breeds, more agility", "title": "Westminster dog show will have 2 new breeds, more agility", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/23/westminster-dog-show-will-have-2-new-breeds-more-agility/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150123__20150124_C3_fe24ahwestminsterp1.jpg", "height": 456}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150123__20150124_C3_fe24ahwestminsterp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-23T17:00:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T12:09:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "There are only about 2,000 wirehaired vizslas worldwide, said owner Anton Sagh, whose dog Falko is entered at Westminster.\nFor the first time, the agility competition and noncompetitive \u201cMeet the Breeds\u201d event will be held jointly.\nMore than 2,700 dogs are slated to compete in the traditional main event \u2014 breed judging \u2014 at Westminster\u2019s 139th annual show Feb. 16 and 17.\nThere\u2019s plenty of variety among the people, as well as the dogs, participating in American dogdom\u2019s most prestigious event next month.\nAt 80, Marge Yonda is looking forward to leading her standard poodle through the fast-paced agility competition \u2014 a pursuit Yonda took up when she stopped running marathons at 73."}
