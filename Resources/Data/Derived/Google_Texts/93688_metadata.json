It said it wants to tap into this year\u2019s election season to shine a light on drug prices that affect Americans\u2019 health and pocketbooks.\n\n\u201cEvery candidate has been talking about this issue,\u201d said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the American Hospital Association.\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders, Vermont independent chasing front-runner Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential primaries, has been particularly vocal about the issue, saying Medicare should be required to negotiate with drug companies for better prices. He also says individuals, pharmacists, and wholesalers should be allowed to import prescription drugs from licensed pharmacies in Canada.\n\nMrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign has pledged to \u201ccrack down on rising prescription drug prices and hold drug companies accountable so they get ahead by investing in research, not jacking up costs.\u201d\n\nCongress is also delving into the issue, chastising \u201cpharma bro\u201d Martin Shkreli earlier this year for acquiring a decades-old drug and jacking up its price more than 50-fold.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate Special Committee on Aging will hold a hearing on similar practices by Valeant Pharmaceuticals.\n\nThe sustainable-pricing campaign said consumers should at least know how much pharmaceuticals cost. They want drug makers to disclose the unit price of their products, how expensive a full course of treatment will be and how much the federal government is expected to spend on the drugs.\n\nIt said the Food and Drug Administration needs more resources to clear a backlog of nearly 4,000 generic drug applications, and it wants federal agencies to crack down on companies that \u201cevergreen\u201d their products by tweaking them slightly, at no benefit to the consumer.\n\n\u201cCurrently, pharmaceutical manufacturers can extend market exclusivity protections by seeking approval for a \u2018new\u2019 product that is essentially the same as the original,\u201d the campaign said. \u201cProhibiting such tactics will bring consumers more options and lower prices more quickly.\u201d\n\nThe pharmaceutical industry\u2019s top lobbying group was not impressed with the proposals, arguing they unfairly targeted the sector instead of going after hospitals, insurers or other catalysts for health spending.\n\n\u201cThese so-called market-based proposals are nothing more than a litany of new government regulations and mandates that would undermine the competitive market and empower government bureaucrats and insurance companies to make one-size-fits-all treatment decisions for patients,\u201d said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.\n\n\u201cRather than address health care costs holistically, these proposals only apply to the small share of health care spending that goes toward life-saving medicines while exempting the largest health care cost drivers, such as hospital charges, which include significant markups for prescription medicines,\u201d he said.\n\nRecent polling suggests that rising drug costs are a major concern for Americans when it comes to health policy, even out-pacing changes brought on by Obamacare.\n\nMore than eight in 10 Americans favor both requiring drug companies to disclose more detail on how they set their prices and allowing the federal government to negotiate with the companies to get a lower price for Medicare recipients, according to a survey conducted last year by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThree quarters of Republicans said increased market competition would drive down prices, while a majority of Democrats preferred more regulation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A diverse coalition of seniors, health plans and private companies proposed a series of steps Monday to tamp down the cost of prescription drugs, from speeding the approval of generics to publicly reporting notable price hikes.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A diverse coalition of seniors, health plans and private companies proposed a series of steps Monday to tamp down the cost of prescription drugs, from speeding the approval of generics to publicly reporting notable price hikes.", "title": "Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing proposes ways to cut rising drug costs", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/25/campaign-sustainable-rx-pricing-proposes-ways-cut-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/02/drug_price_hikes-congress.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/02/02/drug_price_hikes-congress.jpeg", "description": "A diverse coalition of seniors, health plans and private companies proposed a series of steps Monday to tamp down the cost of prescription drugs, from speeding the approval of generics to publicly rep", "card": "summary", "title": "Campaign for Sustainable Rx Pricing proposes ways to cut rising drug c"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Business Finance, Politics, Medicare"}, "article_summary": "It said it wants to tap into this year\u2019s election season to shine a light on drug prices that affect Americans\u2019 health and pocketbooks.\nThe campaign is made up of more than 80 organizations, from Walmart to AARP to health plans such as Kaiser Permanente.\nRecent polling suggests that rising drug costs are a major concern for Americans when it comes to health policy, even out-pacing changes brought on by Obamacare.\nThree quarters of Republicans said increased market competition would drive down prices, while a majority of Democrats preferred more regulation.\nSen.
