In an interview with CNBC last year, Christie said he loved National Review and read it \"all the time.\" Whereas in a recent appearance at CPAC, Christie slammed The New York Times as an outlet that was trying to \"kill\" him \"every day.\"\n\nThe report, which will appear in the issue that hits newsstands Friday, is by Steven Malanga, a contributing editor to City Journal. The cover features Christie and the New Jersey Capitol in a sinking boat, with dollar bills pouring overboard. The headline: \"Chris Christie's New Jersey problem.\"\n\n\"[S]ince winning reelection easily in 2013, Christie has watched his reputation tumble both in New Jersey and nationwide,\" Malanga reports. \"This is partly the result of the political fallout from the so-called Bridgegate scandal ... But, in addition, the governor\u2019s efforts at cleaning up the state\u2019s multitude of fiscal messes and recharging its economy have stalled, prompting criticisms that he isn\u2019t doing enough to revive New Jersey.\"\n\nAt its conclusion, Malanga notes that \"Christie\u2019s administration could have achieved so much more. It might have demonstrated to the state\u2019s cynical and beleaguered voters that it is possible to change the culture of Trenton, to overturn the greedy, profligate, dysfunctional politics that has so consistently earned new Jersey a reputation as one of the worst-managed states, and to set state government on a path toward financial stability and regulatory sanity.\"\n\n\"But Christie still has time to demonstrate just how destructive years of tax-borrow-and-spend policies have been,\" Malanga adds, \"and this would be a real achievement.\"\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "<p>The National Review will publish a cover story this week about Chris Christie's failure to revive New Jersey's economy, editor Rich Lowry told the On Media blog on Wednesday.</p>", "title": "National Review to hit Christie on N.J. record", "url": "http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2015/03/national-review-to-hit-christie-on-nj-record-203497.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/03/04/untitled.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "<p>The National Review will publish a cover story this week about Chris Christie's failure to revive New Jersey's economy, editor Rich Lowry told the On Media blog on Wednesday.</p>", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In an interview with CNBC last year, Christie said he loved National Review and read it \"all the time.\"\n\"[S]ince winning reelection easily in 2013, Christie has watched his reputation tumble both in New Jersey and nationwide,\" Malanga reports.\nOn Media Blog Archives Select Date\u2026 December, 2015 November, 2015 October, 2015 September, 2015 August, 2015 July, 2015 June, 2015 May, 2015 April, 2015 March, 2015 February, 2015 January, 2015National Review to hit Christie on N.J. recordThe National Review will publish a cover story this week about Chris Christie's failure to revive New Jersey's economy, editor Rich Lowry told the On Media blog on Wednesday.\nThe cover features Christie and the New Jersey Capitol in a sinking boat, with dollar bills pouring overboard.\n\"But Christie still has time to demonstrate just how destructive years of tax-borrow-and-spend policies have been,\" Malanga adds, \"and this would be a real achievement.\""}
