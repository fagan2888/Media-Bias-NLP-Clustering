That law removes protections for gay, lesbians, and bisexuals and prohibits transgender individuals from using bathrooms not designated for the gender the user was assigned at birth. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said there were \u201cboth policy and legal questions that are raised by the passage of this law.\u201d\n\nThis follows an open letter from 120 business leaders as well as other individual statements from business and industry heads who say that the provision is business-unfriendly.\n\nTransportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, the former mayor of Charlotte, said last week that the measure \u201cisn\u2019t who we are\u201d and revealed that his department was reviewing whether it would prompt a loss in agency funds.\n\n\u201cThis is going beyond ideology,\u201d the North Carolina native said. \u201cThis is going into a level of tyranny that I think is dangerous.\u201d\n\nFoxx\u2019s agency alone sends approximately $1 billion a year to North Carolina. The Department of Education provides closer to $4.5 billion.\n\nDavid Stacy, government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, says that a whole host of federal laws contain provisions on anti-discrimination, from Title IX in the Education Amendments of 1972 to the Affordable Care Act and the Violence Against Women Act.\n\n\u201cThis North Carolina law is a sweeping law that really undercuts significant federal protections, and the federal government has a responsibility to examine what levers they have, and what authority they have, to ensure that transgender residents in North Carolina have the federal protections they\u2019re entitled to,\u201d he said.\u2014Ruth McCambridge", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state of North Carolina may be risking more than $5.5 billion in just federal funds from passing a law that discriminates against LGBT people.", "original-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/04/05/federal-agencies-review-nc-funding-based-on-new-lgbt-law/", "og": {"site_name": "Non Profit News For Nonprofit Organizations | Nonprofit Quarterly", "description": "The state of North Carolina may be risking more than $5.5 billion in just federal funds from passing a law that discriminates against LGBT people.", "title": "Federal Agencies Review NC Funding Based on New LGBT Law", "url": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/04/05/federal-agencies-review-nc-funding-based-on-new-lgbt-law/", "image": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/56/files/2016/04/Public-Restrooms-for-Trans.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@npquarterly", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/04/05/federal-agencies-review-nc-funding-based-on-new-lgbt-law/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News,  federal funding,  Housing and Urban Development,  North Carolina, bathroom bills, LGBTQ discrimination"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis North Carolina law is a sweeping law that really undercuts significant federal protections, and the federal government has a responsibility to examine what levers they have, and what authority they have, to ensure that transgender residents in North Carolina have the federal protections they\u2019re entitled to,\u201d he said.\u2014Ruth McCambridge\n\u201cThis is going into a level of tyranny that I think is dangerous.\u201dFoxx\u2019s agency alone sends approximately $1 billion a year to North Carolina.\n\u201cThis is going beyond ideology,\u201d the North Carolina native said.\nThat law removes protections for gay, lesbians, and bisexuals and prohibits transgender individuals from using bathrooms not designated for the gender the user was assigned at birth.\nApril 4, 2016; Washington PostThe federal departments of Education, Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development are considering cutting funding from North Carolina in the wake of its passage of a law seen as discriminatory against the LGBTQ communities in that state."}
