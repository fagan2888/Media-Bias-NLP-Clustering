MINOT, N.D. (AP) - A $40 million ail expansion project in Minot will not be as large as promised due to increasing costs, construction managers told Ward County commissioners on Friday.

Officials said Friday that the plan to add 200 new beds to the Ward County Jail will not fit into the $39.9 million budget.

Some other aspects of the remodeling and expansion project have also been removed and turned into options to be added to the project if costs come in below current estimates, KXMC-TV reported (http://bit.ly/1Ni8IRb ).

The jail expansion was deemed necessary because the current 104-bed capacity at the jail has been inadequate to hold the increasing number of prisoners. To meet their needs, jail officials have been shipping about 30 inmates to other facilities.

Originally planned to add 200, the total capacity of the new addition will now be 144 beds, giving the jail a total capacity of 248 beds.

The plan calls for the remaining 56 beds - or 28 cells - to be roughed in with the option of completing them later.

Ward County Sheriff Steve Kukowski said the most important option to be added back in, if funds are available, is an improved intake area where inmates are processed on arrival.

Construction managers believe accelerating the pace of the job will bring savings in avoiding inflation and saving the cost of requiring heating in the building during construction.

“I mean that’s real money just by compressing the schedule,” said Mark Liska, a construction manager.

Commissioners voted to go ahead with the first phase of the project, with construction scheduled to begin by Nov. 1.
