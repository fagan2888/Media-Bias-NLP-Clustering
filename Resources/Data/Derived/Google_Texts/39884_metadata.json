(Photo: John Light/BillMoyers.com)\n\nNext Monday, New York City\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board will vote on a proposed rent freeze for the city\u2019s roughly one million tenants who live in rent-stabilized buildings. The move, which was championed by Mayor Bill de Blasio during his election campaign, would be unprecedented in the 45-year history of the city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board.\n\nIt comes as the city faces a housing crunch that\u2019s unlike anything in recent history. An April report by City Comptroller Scott Stringer found that between 2000 and 2012, median apartment rents rose by 75 percent \u2014 that\u2019s compared to 44 percent for the rest of the US. Over the same period, New Yorkers saw their average incomes actually decrease after adjusting for inflation.\n\nAdvocates and some politicians \u2014 including Comptroller Stringer and Public Advocate Letita James \u2014 say a rent freeze could help New York remain affordable for low- and middle-income residents.\n\n\u201cPredatory equity\u201d\n\nA freeze would also put a damper on a trend that housing advocates call \u201cpredatory equity.\u201d\n\nWith the cost of real estate climbing, the city\u2019s market has become a good bet for speculators with private equity money. Increasingly, landlords in gentrifying neighborhoods are not a single individual or a family, but a large, faceless hedge fund seeking to turn a large profit on renters\u2019 homes.\n\n\u201cIn the years leading up to 2008, we had lots of private equity companies coming in and snapping up buildings from private individuals,\u201d said Cea Weaver, an assistant director with the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB), a tenant advocacy nonprofit. After the 2008 crash, New York, like the rest of the country, suffered a wave of foreclosures. But the city\u2019s real-estate market rebounded faster than others. \u201cWe\u2019re just sort of seeing a resurgence of the same sort of speculative prices for the first time in awhile,\u201d Weaver said.\n\nSpeculators often pay far more for a building than its current tenants\u2019 rents can support. \u201cWhen a landlord speculates on a building, they\u2019re basically making the assumption that they\u2019re going to be able to rapidly raise rents,\u201d said Weaver. UHAB studied one building in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn, a rapidly gentrifying neighborhood, with over $5 million dollars in loans on it. Given what tenants pay in rent, UHAB calculated that the building could only support a loan of less than $2 million.\n\nEach year, the Rent Guidelines Board sets how quickly landlords are able to raise rent. To release an apartment from rent regulation, a landlord must raise the rent to $2,500 a month. When a new tenant moves into a rent-regulated apartment and signs a lease for $2,500 or more, that apartment gets released from rent controls.\n\nSo the key to predatory equity is to push out long-term tenants who enjoy lower rents.\n\nOrganizing around a rent freeze\n\nVera Walker has lived in Crown Heights her entire life. She\u2019ll be 87 next month.\n\nWhen she was a child, it was a predominately white neighborhood, but in the 1960s and 1970s, the racial make-up shifted toward African- and Caribbean-Americans, with pockets of Hasidic Jewish communities. Walker\u2019s community is now ground zero for gentrification \u2014 and for predatory real estate investments.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have any problem with the people coming back,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the poor people \u2014 the people that have been here, and supported the landlord, and were able to hold on to their property \u2014 they\u2019re being pushed out.\n\n\u201cAnd even the so-called rich people that are coming in, they can\u2019t afford the rents. They take a one-bedroom apartment, and in order to pay their rent, they have three or four or five people living in that one-bedroom apartment. That speaks volumes.\u201d\n\nAt a tenant rally earlier this month, Keisha Jacobs, an organizer with the Crown Heights Tenant Union, described some the displacement strategies longstanding tenants are faced with every day: \u201cThe stack of small injustices; the clerical mistakes on your rent receipt; the administrative errors like cashing your rent check late; the miscommunication, repeated unreturned messages. They say they\u2019re coming to finally fix your sink. You take a valuable day off only to have them never show up. Or the ceiling in your bathroom that\u2019s coming down around your ears, but you see workmen fixing your new neighbors\u2019 apartment because they pay twice as much as you do.\n\n\u201cThese things are not just oversights. It\u2019s not incompetence. It\u2019s not mismanagement. This is not just a simple screw up. It\u2019s systemic. It\u2019s tactical. You are being targeted.\u201d\n\nIn Crown Heights, a rent freeze has become a rallying cry for tenants old and new who want to unite against predatory landlords.\n\n\u201cI think it [gentrification] causes a lot of fear in people, and you think \u2018what am I doing? How am I a part of this?'\u201d said Celeste Hornbach, a member of the Crown Heights Tenant Union who moved to the neighborhood four years ago after graduating college. \u201cSo joining a tenant union with long-term tenants and fighting back together is one way I can feel like it\u2019s not just me coming in and forcing them out, it\u2019s making it about a bigger issue \u2014 that this is a structural problem, real estate, and it\u2019s not us against them. We have to fight together.\u201d\n\nHow a rent freeze could help\n\nA rent freeze could shut down speculation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s telling the speculators, \u2018you can buy this building if you want to, but you are not going to be able to raise the rents on it,'\u201d said Weaver. \u201cIf you know, from the get-go, that you\u2019re not going to be able to raise rents on a rent-regulated building, then why the hell would you speculate on it?\u201d\n\nHornbach, of the Crown Heights Tenants Union, said she\u2019s hopeful that with a new, progressive mayor and city council, New York is ready to tackle its housing crunch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still something we have to organize around and rally against,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I definitely feel like the moment is hot right now with the rent guidelines board vote coming up. And I hope we get the rent freeze.\u201d\n\nUpdate: The Rent Guidelines Board did not approve a rent freeze, instead opting for an historically low rent increase.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports \u201cthe board voted 5-4 to approve a 1% increase for one-year renewal leases beginning on or after Oct. 1. Tenants who opt for two-year leases could face up to a 2.75% increase. \u2026 Until Monday\u2019s vote, the smallest increase the board approved since its inception in 1969 had been 2%, last adopted in 2012.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The move could shut down predatory investing in the city's real estate market.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "The move could shut down predatory investing in the city's real estate market.", "title": "Can a Rent Freeze Beat Back New York's Predatory Wall Street Landlords? | BillMoyers.com", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_0912_edit.jpg", "height": 427}, "updated_time": "2014-08-21T09:22:10-04:00", "url": "http://billmoyers.com/2014/06/21/can-a-rent-freeze-beat-back-new-yorks-predatory-wall-street-landlords/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The move could shut down predatory investing in the city's real estate market.", "creator": "@lighttweeting", "image": "http://dy00k1db5oznd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/IMG_0912_edit.jpg", "title": "Can a Rent Freeze Beat Back New York's Predatory Wall Street Landlords? | BillMoyers.com", "site": "@BillMoyersHQ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "article": {"section": "Activism", "tag": "widget", "published_time": "2014-06-21T14:34:47-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-21T09:22:10-04:00"}, "pubdate": 20140621, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf7c\"", "article_summary": "We have to fight together.\u201dHow a rent freeze could helpA rent freeze could shut down speculation.\nAnd I hope we get the rent freeze.\u201dUpdate: The Rent Guidelines Board did not approve a rent freeze, instead opting for an historically low rent increase.\nYou are being targeted.\u201dIn Crown Heights, a rent freeze has become a rallying cry for tenants old and new who want to unite against predatory landlords.\nAdvocates and some politicians \u2014 including Comptroller Stringer and Public Advocate Letita James \u2014 say a rent freeze could help New York remain affordable for low- and middle-income residents.\n'\u201d said Celeste Hornbach, a member of the Crown Heights Tenant Union who moved to the neighborhood four years ago after graduating college."}
