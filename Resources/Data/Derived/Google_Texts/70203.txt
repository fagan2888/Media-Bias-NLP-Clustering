Mercy Health announced Thursday it will fire 347 workers due to “increasing challenges to our reimbursement structure as we adjust to reductions mandated by the Affordable Care Act,” the company said in a statement.

President and CEO of the Mercy system, Lynn Britton, said the Obamacare-induced layoffs are taking a toll on workers and their families.

“Changes such as these are difficult and distressing for everyone involved,” said Britton. “While our decisions support Mercy’s ability to stay strong and relevant in the face of challenges impacting all health care providers, today our thoughts and prayers are with those co-workers who are affected.”

Mercy Health’s firings will take place across the four states in which the health system operates, which includes Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Kansas.

Nationally, Obamacare remains deeply unpopular. The RealClearPolitics average of polls finds that just 43% of Americans support Obama’s signature legislative achievement.

Obamacare will cost U.S. taxpayers $2.6 trillion over its first 10 years.
