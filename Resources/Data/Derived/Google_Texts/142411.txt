Stein said, “Of course he should have gone. Of course he has contempt. I think he has contempt for just about everybody not just dead Jews. I think he has contempt for people murdered everywhere. I mean, I don’t think he has much regard for people killed by the Islamic State. I don’t think he has much regard for people killed by al Qaeda, fighting other Arabs, fighting Muslims. I just don’t think he’s much of a guy in terms of human empathy.”
