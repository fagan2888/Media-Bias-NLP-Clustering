Actor J.K. Simmons, who won an Oscar for his supporting role as Terence Fletcher in “Whiplash,” had an emotional message during his acceptance speech Sunday night: Call your parents.

“And if i may, call your mom,” Mr. Simmons said after thanking his wife, Michelle Schumacher, and three kids. “Everybody — I’m told there’s like a billion people or so. Call your mom, call your dad.”

“If you are lucky enough to have a parent or two alive on this planet, call them,” he added. “Don’t text, don’t e-mail. Call them on the phone. Tell them you love them and thank them and will be to them for as long as they want to talk to you.”

“Thank you. Thank you, Mom and Dad,” he concluded.

Mr. Simmons has been dominating the best supporting actor category in “Whiplash,” taking home awards at the Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild Awards, Critics’ Choice Awards and BAFTA Awards.
