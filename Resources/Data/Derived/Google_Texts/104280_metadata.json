It went up about six feet. Stone blew up around it. Concrete was flying everywhere.\u201d\n\nEmma Edwards, her niece, was shook up.\n\n\u201cShe kept saying, \u2018It go boom; it go boom,\u201d Edwards said.\n\nAs Edwards stayed with her niece, her older sister, Ashley Edwards, 24, ran outside and saw a woman on the ground.\n\n\u201cHer pants were ripped,\u201d said Ashley Edwards. \u201cThey had singe holes. Her right arm was dislocated. There was blood coming out of her nose.\u201d\n\nThe Edwards sisters, who have shared an apartment for about two years, had witnessed what Hillsborough County Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies say was an explosion of unknown origin at the grill, recently installed just outside the apartment complex clubhouse.\n\nEmergency personnel quickly responded to the apartment complex at 4747 W. Waters Ave. One person was taken to Tampa General Hospital, deputies say.\n\nInvestigators late Monday afternoon were trying to determine the cause of the explosion and had not identified the two people injured.\n\nBrooke Edwards said the woman on the ground was the mother of a 13-year-old girl who was having a birthday party. The teen also was injured, said the Edwards sisters, who do not know the victims\u2019 names or how badly they were injured.\n\nHillsborough County Fire Rescue later reported both victims had flash burns and the adult had a broken arm. None of the injuries was life-threatening.\n\nAs many as 15 people were around the grill when it exploded, Brooke Edwards said. \u201cI\u2019m glad it wasn\u2019t worse,\u201d she said.\n\nHours after the explosion, the extent of the damage still was evident. Two silver hoods were strewn several feet from where the pit, made of stone and concrete blocks, had been. The blast pushed one block forward several feet. Chunks of broken stone were heaped around it.\n\nMore than a dozen hotdogs, a hamburger and other food, as well as tongs and a plastic spatula, were scattered nearby.\n\nThere have been problems with the grill in the past, Ashley Edwards said. About two weeks ago, she said, her father had difficulty lighting it. \u201cThe ignitor wasn\u2019t working,\u201d Ashley Edwards said, \u201cso he had to light a piece of palm frond to ignite it.\u201d\n\nCounty records show the The Oaks at Woodland Park apartments is owned by Inwood Park Owner of Tampa LLC, a Des Moines, Iowa, company. A call to the management office was not immediately returned late Monday afternoon.\n\nThe Edward sisters said they are in the process of moving out of the complex.\n\n\u201cNot a moment too soon,\u201d said Brooke Edwards. \u201cI\u2019m still pretty shook up.\u201d\n\nhaltman@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7629\n\n@haltman", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Mon, 26 May 2014 11:04:03 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Brooke Edwards was sitting on the couch in her second-floor apartment at the Oaks at Woodland Park apartments, watching Care Bears with her 2-year-old niece, when she heard a tremendous", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Brooke Edwards was sitting on the couch in her second-floor apartment at the Oaks at Woodland Park apartments, watching Care Bears with her 2-year-old niece, when she heard a tremendous", "title": "Mom, daughter hurt in Carrollwood propane grill explosion", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/northwest-tampa/two-injured-in-carrollwood-propane-grill-explosion-20140526/", "image": {"width": 4000, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140526/ARTICLE/140529442/EP/1/3/EP-140529442.jpg", "height": 2248}, "updated_time": "2014-05-26T17:53:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Brooke Edwards was sitting on the couch in her second-floor apartment at the Oaks at Woodland Park apartments, watching Care Bears with her 2-year-old niece, when she heard a tremendo", "title": "Mom, daughter hurt in Carrollwood propane grill explosion", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140526/ARTICLE/140529442/AR/0/AR-140529442.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-05-26T11:04:03Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-05-26T17:53:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "explosion"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1e35\"", "article_summary": "The teen also was injured, said the Edwards sisters, who do not know the victims\u2019 names or how badly they were injured.\nAs Edwards stayed with her niece, her older sister, Ashley Edwards, 24, ran outside and saw a woman on the ground.\nThere have been problems with the grill in the past, Ashley Edwards said.\n\u201cHer pants were ripped,\u201d said Ashley Edwards.\nConcrete was flying everywhere.\u201dEmma Edwards, her niece, was shook up."}
