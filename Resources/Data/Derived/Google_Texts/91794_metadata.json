While some actually use the appropriate resources to be more connected to their customers, others continue to give lip-service to it. After all, it\u2019s very easy to say you are customer-focused when, in reality, you\u2019re not.\n\nFor nearly a decade, I\u2019ve studied the operations of companies across dozens of industries to make sense of it all. I believe that genuine customer-centric companies exhibit the following five traits.\n\nThe CEO Is The Flag Bearer\n\nNo customer experience program will be sustainable if your CEO isn\u2019t your greatest flag bearer. I\u2019ve seen it time and time again, an executive claims to be customer-focused but when push comes to shove they allow sales and marketing to reign supreme.\n\nI\u2019m a HUGE fan of Westjet airlines, based in Canada, for several reasons. A key reason why I\u2019m bullish on their success is because of their leader, CEO, Gregg Saretsky. I\u2019m a fan of his because he has humanized the way he leads his team. Perhaps, it\u2019s because he use to be a flight attendant before his climb to being the CEO of the second largest airlines in Canada. I have a friend who works at Westjet\u2019s HQ who speak very admirably of him. I mean, it\u2019s very rare for me to go to a party and have someone talk to me about their CEO for 30 minutes, while I drink my scotch, but this happened to be earlier this year when one of his team members did so. The CEO, entrepreneur or business leader within your company can\u2019t just wake up one day and care about the company\u2019s customers. They must have it within their DNA as a person because caring about strangers isn\u2019t something that comes natural to most of us.\n\nIt\u2019s very easy to gain media attention and claim to be customer-focused but does your organization continue these efforts at the end of the quarter when you must hit your numbers? Does your company sacrifice the customer experience to save the numbers?\n\nYou Must be Willing To Think Long-Term\n\nAn organization must understand that if customer experience is going to be at the core of their company then they must be patient.The ROI of customer experience doesn\u2019t develop overnight and is a long term play.\n\nYour customer experience is a collection of events your customer experiences when doing business with you from beginning to end. For example, if you go to a movie theatre, the experience may begin with you visiting their mobile website to see what movies are playing. When you arrive at the theatre, you will purchase your ticket, visit the bathroom and buy popcorn at the concession stand. Even before you have watched the movie you already have experienced four customer touchpoints that involves marketing, operations and sales departments. To be able to recreate or refine your customer experience you must include all departments. This takes time. For some companies, this won\u2019t ever happen because of silos that exist within the organization.\n\nNow, think about how long it takes to develop a marketing campaign, a part of your business that is given a far larger budget than your customer experience efforts. I believe traditional marketing, such as radio, tv and print, has trained us to be impatient because we can have a marketing campaign up and running in a month or two. If you work with an agency, you can have your radio campaign aired in no time. If you\u2019re a small business, you can have your direct-mail sent out next month.\n\nMy argument is this: you will never be customer-focused if you don\u2019t practice patience. Customer experience WILL grow your business, however, you must be in it for the long haul.\n\nJeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, says it best,\n\n\u201cWe are willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time.\u201d\n\nWhat he means is that he will invest to improve Amazon\u2019s customer experience even if the ROI is 12-24 months away.\n\nAre we going to argue with his success?\n\nRecommended for You Webcast: Hacking SEO: The Fastest Way to Double Your Rankings in 90 Days\n\nUnderstand Creating Micro Customer Experiences Is Worth The Investment\n\nWhen I was invited to speak at Tangerine Bank\u2019s executive retreat earlier this year, I introduced them to what I call micro customer experiences. How I define a micro customer experience is a small, subtle, memorable and affordable gesture that will resonate with your customers for years.\n\nStarbucks understands micro customer experiences by writing your name on your cup. A local small business practices micro customer experiences by writing their customers hand written cards that include personalized messages.\n\nWhen I introduce this concept to my clients or audience, I can always plan on someone asking,\n\n\u201cHow do you scale this?\u201d\n\nThe answer to this question is quite simple: How much do you care? If you care enough you will find the resources or workflow to scale it.\n\nI\u2019m sure the Starbucks operations team questioned how this would scale as I guess it adds 3-5 seconds to each customer interaction. For the most part, they were able to figure it out.\n\nA small business owner may think,\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t afford to pay someone to write hand written cards to every customer!\u201d\n\nYou can afford to pay someone to do this! After all, don\u2019t you spend 5-15 percent of your top-line revenue on marketing? You can allocate a percentage of your marketing spend and reinvest it into becoming memorable, which will bring you organic revenue through repeat business and referrals.\n\nFor a company to be successful in 2015, customer experience and marketing teams must work together to improve the customer experience and increase customer acquisition through organic marketing such as word of mouth.\n\nRecognize That Customer Experience Is Marketing\n\nTake a moment to answer this question to yourself before you move forward.\n\nWhat comes to mind when you see Zappos\u2019 logo?\n\nDo you think of their customer experience or what font they used?\n\nDo you smile because of the call centre employee you spoke to when you ordered your pair of sandals, or do you think of what hue of blue was used to create the footprint in their logo?\n\nForward-thinking marketing pros understand that customer experience is marketing. You may have heard this before, and agree or disagree, whatever your opinion is, allow me to help you think differently.\n\nThe Next Web, one of my favorite tech and business websites, published a post titled, \u201cWhy I\u2019d Rather Email than Pay for Ads.\u201d If you have a moment to read it, please do. The columnist explains that as an entrepreneur, she\u2019d rather focus on building a double opt-in email list to provide value to her community by producing exceptional content; we know this to be content marketing. Before she pushes a \u2018buy from me\u2019 email she first provides value through content on several different occasions, and then asks for a sale.\n\nSeth Godin refers to this approach of marketing as \u201cpermission marketing.\u201d Gary Vaynerchuk, wrote an entire book on this approach called Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook.\n\nProviding valuable content to make your customers smarter or more efficient can also be considered customer experience. If you can educate your customers through the content you create, isn\u2019t that providing a better customer experience?\n\nOne of my clients, one of Vancouver\u2019s largest auto dealership groups, is doubling down on their content marketing this year to better educate their customers on their industry. The auto industry has a massive opportunity to make their customers smarter. Personally, I don\u2019t know much about my SUV other than that the right pedal is for go, the left pedal is to stop and that my SiriusXM radio has more than one pre-recorded hip hop channel. As a consumer, when I receive an email from them about \u201c5 Things Your Car Needs to Prepare for Winter\u201d I will read it and become a smarter customer. For me, this is a better customer experience than seeing one of their competitors ads on the back of the bus.\n\nContent marketing is powered by producing educational content that enriches your customer\u2019s lives.\n\nDoes your marketing team understand that customer experience is marketing? If not, please share this post with them.\n\nYou Must Continuously Invest In Employee Experience\n\nI come from a very traditional family, and I still go to my family home once a week to have dinner with my parents and sister. A few weeks ago, my father admitted that he doesn\u2019t fully understand what I do. He knows my subject but didn\u2019t understand what steps I take when I consult for a company to improve their customer experience.\n\nI began to explain to him that I first audit the company\u2019s employee experience. Where do they recruit their employees? What questions do they ask during the interview process? What\u2019s their on-boarding experience like? How do they motivate and reward their team?\n\nI chose to explain this to him first because it\u2019s what I do with my clients. It\u2019s typical for me to receive an email from an entrepreneur or executive who says,\n\n\u201cHelp us increase our customer loyalty.\u201d\n\nI never start with the customer. Ever!\n\nThe most successful companies understand to be successful you must: find great people, give them the tools and education they need to succeed and then get out of the way to allow them to navigate the customer experience.\n\nThe other day, I read this Business Insider article about Nordstrom\u2019s. The article explains \u201chow Nordstrom\u2019s became the most successful retailer.\u201d The number one reason was because of their dedication to customer service. Within this point, the columnist outlines that they hire \u201cnice, capable people.\u201d\n\nThis is exactly why I always start with the employee experience. How on earth are you suppose to deliver a memorable customer experience, one that your customers obsess over, if you don\u2019t have the right team to push your effort forward? Company\u2019s that are customer-focused first become employee-focused.\n\nDoes your company focus on your employee experience to improve the customer experience?\n\nWe make business complicated.\n\nBusiness is as hard as we want to make it for ourselves. Many of you are familiar with my story about how I learned my greatest business practices from my grandfather and his fish market in Lima, Peru. If we truly want to be successful, we must be able to take a step back, analyze what is not working in our business or department and trim the fat. After you have done so, review these five traits and ask yourself if you are truly customer-focused.\n\nNow, here\u2019s a tough question. What one trait is the most important to become customer-focused?", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Business 2 Community", "description": "How do you personally define a customer-focused company?
