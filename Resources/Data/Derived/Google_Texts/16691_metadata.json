After all, they\u2019re about to be cut up; their body invaded. Undoubtedly, topping the list of preoperative anxieties is the fear that they won\u2019t be anesthetized enough, waking up mid-surgery, with their bodies open, unable to move and feeling everything. As it turns out, renditions of these incidents, called anesthesia awareness, occur in about 300 people per year in the UK and Ireland.\n\nAll of these patients were given general anesthesia, a cocktail of intravenous drugs with several purposes: They cause amnesia, pain relief, muscle paralysis, and sedation. Anesthesia awareness occurs when one of these drugs isn\u2019t administered in as strong a dose as the others. Interested in seeing just how often it occurs, researchers from the UK\u2019s Royal College of Anaesthetists and the Association of Anaesthetists looked into occurrences throughout the UK and Ireland, and their psychological effects on patients.\n\nThey found that one out of every 19,000 operations \u2014 other estimates put that number at one in 1,000 \u2014 resulted in an incidence of anesthesia awareness, and that 41 percent of patients who awoke mid-surgery were psychologically damaged for years after. \u201cFor the vast majority, it should be reassuring that patients report they were conscious during operations so infrequently. However, for a small number of patients, this can be a highly distressing experience,\u201d said lead researcher Professor Tim Cook, of the Royal United Hospital, according to the BBC.\n\nThe study involved analyzing data on over three million operations that occurred during a single year. The researchers found that about one in 670 women undergoing C-sections with general anesthesia experienced some level of awareness, which was often a result of a miscalculation in the administration of sedation drugs; while the doctors wanted the patient unconscious, they wanted the baby to remain awake. Other times a person woke up included during heart and lung surgeries for obese people.\n\nFortunately, the majority of them only awoke for a brief period of time \u2014 either before surgery or once it was completed. However, that amount of time was just enough for them to feel their bodies paralyzed and unable to talk, causing them to panic, feel pain, or in some cases, choke.\n\nFor one patient who underwent orthodontic surgery (surgery of the facial bones) at the age of 12, waking up during the procedure caused 15 years of subsequent nightmares in which she said monsters leapt out of the darkness to paralyze her. \u201cI could hear voices around me and I realized with horror that I had woken up in the middle of the operation but couldn\u2019t move a muscle,\u201d she told the BBC about her experience with anesthesia awareness. \u201cWhile they fiddled, I frantically tried to decide whether I was about to die.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until she connected this experience to her nightmares that she was able to sleep peacefully.\n\nAccording to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, anesthesiologists are required to monitor patients during the entire course of their surgery. During this time, they\u2019re supposed to make sure patients are getting proper amounts of anesthetic drugs; that they\u2019re breathing properly, with the help of oxygen and mechanical ventilators; that their blood \u2014 and the drugs \u2014 is circulating properly, and that body temperature is constant.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "over, 300, people, wake, during, surgery, each, year, how, anesthesia, awareness, affects, mind", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Patients undergoing anesthesia may not always remain sedated, waking up mid-surgery, unable to move or speak.", "title": "Patients Wake Up During Surgery All The Time, No Biggie", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/over-300-people-wake-during-surgery-each-year-how-anesthesia-awareness-affects-mind-302346", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/10/anesthesia.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Patients undergoing anesthesia may not always remain sedated, waking up mid-surgery, unable to move or speak.", "title": "Patients Wake Up During Surgery All The Time, No Biggie", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/over-300-people-wake-during-surgery-each-year-how-anesthesia-awareness-affects-mind-302346", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/10/anesthesia.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/10/anesthesia.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-09-10T12:57:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-10T12:57:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Patients undergoing anesthesia may not always remain sedated, waking up mid-surgery, unable to move or speak."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c71\"", "article_summary": "For one patient who underwent orthodontic surgery (surgery of the facial bones) at the age of 12, waking up during the procedure caused 15 years of subsequent nightmares in which she said monsters leapt out of the darkness to paralyze her.\nAs it turns out, renditions of these incidents, called anesthesia awareness, occur in about 300 people per year in the UK and Ireland.\nIt\u2019s probably a rare thing for patients going into surgery to feel confident that they\u2019ll come out unharmed.\nAccording to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, anesthesiologists are required to monitor patients during the entire course of their surgery.\nAnesthesia awareness occurs when one of these drugs isn\u2019t administered in as strong a dose as the others."}
