It\u2019s grass-roots \u2013 she has to do work to see the teams,\u201d wrote another.\n\nOther Twitter users argued that the movement does have leadership with Al Sharpton, who has led multiple rallies in Ferguson and New York City, as well as rallied nationwide to protest police brutality and racial discrimination.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In what appeared to be a snub to Al Sharpton, Oprah Winfrey recently argued that demonstrators in New York City and Ferguson lack the same motivation and leadership of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "In what appeared to be a snub to Al Sharpton, Oprah Winfrey recently argued that demonstrators in New York City and Ferguson lack the same motivation and leadership of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.", "title": "Oprah Winfrey snubs Al Sharpton, says protesters lack leadership", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/4/oprah-winfrey-snubs-al-sharpton-says-protesters-la/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/15/742d9caf25344031680f6a7067007629.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/12/15/742d9caf25344031680f6a7067007629.jpg", "description": "In what appeared to be a snub to Al Sharpton, Oprah Winfrey recently argued that demonstrators in New York City and Ferguson lack the same motivation and leadership of the civil rights movement of the", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Oprah Winfrey snubs Al Sharpton, says protesters lack leadership"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Entertainment Culture, Oprah Winfrey, Ferguson, Al Sharpton, New York City"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc9dc\"", "article_summary": "In what appeared to be a snub to Al Sharpton, Oprah Winfrey recently argued that demonstrators in New York City and Ferguson lack the same motivation and leadership of the civil rights movement of the 1960s.\nSo, while @oprah searches for an outdated leadership model, #weworkin,\u201d wrote one Twitter user.\n\u201cIf @Oprah doesn\u2019t see \u2018leadership\u2019 in Ferguson, it\u2019s cuz she\u2019s not really looking.\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m looking for is some kind of leadership to come out of this to say, \u2018This is what we want.\nMs. Winfrey produced \u201cSelma,\u201d set to release Friday, which covers the 1965 protests in Alabama over black voting rights."}
