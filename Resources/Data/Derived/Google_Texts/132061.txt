What's that tickle that Boulder voters are feeling at their back pockets? Why it's the long arm of the City Council once again reaching for the wallets of their constituents. Since ObamaCare obviously is too expensive for the Democrat plurality on council and it appears that they are not going to be able to weasel into the city employee health plan, then of course, trying to get a raise is the logical way to increase their income.

I have another suggestion. The City Council should adopt a pay-for-performance plan. Let's see:

1. They have squandered $17 million and counting on the muni scheme.

2. They wasted about $650,000 on the Folsom debacle.

3. They are spending $10,000 to mediate a proposal to become a sister city with a terrorist haven.

4. They made possible the Stalinesque Boulder Junction and would like to replicate that beautiful style throughout Boulder.

5. They rely on the advice of non-elected ideologues like Zane Selvans and Dom Nozzi to promote a plan for exponentially increasing density while telling the citizens it will actually relieve congestion. (Much like removing two traffic lanes from Folsom will improve traffic flow.)

6. They spent $40,000 on a junket to Oregon to learn how to better accommodate the beggars and transients that continue to flow into Boulder.

Based upon these accomplishments alone, if a pay-for-performance was in place, I estimate that the City Council would owe every voter in Boulder about $271.63, not including the pain and suffering inflicted by Selvans and Nozzi. Somehow, I don't think the council will put this pay plan on the ballot.
