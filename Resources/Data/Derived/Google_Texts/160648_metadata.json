We\u2019ve seen moths, ticks, fruit flies, crickets, and cockroaches all nestle inside of people\u2019s ears, but it\u2019s a rare occasion when the insect chooses a person\u2019s nose instead. After all, human anatomy would have it that any bug entering the nose would probably end up in that person\u2019s stomach \u2014 our mouth, on more horrific occasions. That was exactly what happened to a man in India, however, whose nose ended up with 50 maggots. You can watch them being removed, and relax yourself to the humble sound of the sitar, in the video below.\n\nAccording to The Independent, surgeon Dr. Meenesh Juvenkar spent two hours removing the maggots, all of which had grown to about a centimeter in length after spending some time chewing into the 55-year-old man\u2019s sinuses. It was important to get them out as soon as possible, because as if having your face eaten from the inside out isn\u2019t already bad enough, the man was in danger of going blind or even dying, as they moved up. Luckily, Juvenkar completed the surgery, and all of the maggots were disposed of \u2014 after a dramatic gathering in a stainless steel bowl, of course.\n\nIn the 15 years Juvenkar has been practicing ear, nose, and throat medicine, he\u2019s dealt with nasal maggots only six to eight times.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "50, flesh, eating, maggots, take, over, indian, mans, nose, they, get, removed, rather, calming", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "In tropical regions, people are especially prone to having flies land on their body to lay eggs.
