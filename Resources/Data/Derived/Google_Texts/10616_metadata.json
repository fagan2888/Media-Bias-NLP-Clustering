Few Democrats represent small-town and rural areas, and the party is finding it increasingly difficult to attract noncollege-educated white voters,\" said Cook, founder of the influential Cook Political Report.The Democrats' focus on issues such as climate change, illegal immigration and government healthcare \"has effectively decimated the Democratic Party in specific areas and among specific voter blocs,\" he said.Conservative Victor Davis Hanson predicted that Obama \"will end his tenure with the ruin of 'Hope and Change,'\" the campaign slogan that got him elected in 2008.\"Six years after the summer of hope and change, no one in the Democratic Party is showcasing American foreign policy, pushing for cap-and-trade legislation, singing the praises of Obamacare, bragging about the way amnesty was handled, or pointing to a new cleaner and more transparent federal bureaucracy,\" said Hanson, an analyst at the Hoover Institution.\"What started out with 'hope and change' and 'fundamentally transforming the United States of America' ended up with a president who habitually misleads his countrymen, a baffling array of scandals, the discrediting of the obsequious media, and policies that not only did not work but by any historical model could never really have worked,\" he wrote at National Review Online. \"As proof, watch as Democrats regroup for 2016. Their unspoken commandment will be that most of what Obama did, they must either ignore or deny.\"", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "conservative, liberal, analyses, Barack Obama", "pubdate": "2014-12-02T16:31:20", "og": {"site_name": "Newsmax", "description": "President Barack Obama has led the Democrats on an elitist leftward march that has \"decimated\" a political party once dedicated to the middle class worker, a top liberal political analyst wrote Tuesday, as a conservative writer claimed Obama has left \"liberalism in ruins.\"", "title": "Analyses From Left, Right Draw Same Conclusions on Obama", "url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/conservative-liberal-analyses-Barack-Obama/2014/12/02/id/610637/", "page_id": 85452072376, "image": "http://www.newsmax.com/CMSPages/GetFile.aspx?guid=5fc11a93-ed80-4fbe-9ad3-d211e1c5bb0e&SiteName=Newsmax", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/conservative-liberal-analyses-Barack-Obama/2014/12/02/id/610637/", "description": "President Barack Obama has led the Democrats on an elitist leftward march that has \"decimated\" a political party once dedicated to the middle class worker, a top liberal political analyst wrote Tuesday, as a conservative writer claimed Obama has left \"liberalism in ruins.\"", "site": "Newsmax", "title": "Analyses From Left, Right Draw Same Conclusions on Obama"}, "epoch": 1417537880, "keywords": "conservative, liberal, analyses, Barack Obama", "fb": {"admins": 100002083767056, "app_id": 323020797885219}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "published_time": "2014-12-02T16:31:20"}, "msvalidate.01": "FAF1322EC761685A5DD9344A1C19E82A", "google-site-verification": "Jt2HUKgzJJw9VwIQJv31ETytuvNNm5ypTWN6j0nYvHM", "original-source": "http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/conservative-liberal-analyses-Barack-Obama/2014/12/02/id/610637/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "President Barack Obama has led the Democrats on an elitist leftward march that has  decimated  a political party once dedicated to the middle class worker, a top liberal political analyst wrote Tuesday, as a conservative writer claimed Obama has left  liberalism in ruins."}, "article_summary": "President Barack Obama has led the Democrats on an elitist leftward march that has \"decimated\" a political party once dedicated to the middle class worker, a top liberal political analyst wrote Tuesday, as a conservative writer claimed Obama has left \"liberalism in ruins.\nTheir unspoken commandment will be that most of what Obama did, they must either ignore or deny.\"\n\"The South and the Border South, as well as small-town and rural America, are rapidly becoming no-fly zones for Democrats.\n\"As proof, watch as Democrats regroup for 2016.\n\"Six years after the summer of hope and change, no one in the Democratic Party is showcasing American foreign policy, pushing for cap-and-trade legislation, singing the praises of Obamacare, bragging about the way amnesty was handled, or pointing to a new cleaner and more transparent federal bureaucracy,\" said Hanson, an analyst at the Hoover Institution."}
