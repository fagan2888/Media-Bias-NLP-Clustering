Right off the bat, Patinkin began addressing the nature of good and evil and the models through which we decide to go to war.\n\nAt the end of season four of \u201cHomeland,\u201d his character Saul was being held captive and wanted to take his own life instead of have his life mean that terrorists went free as part of an exchange. Saul realizes it\u2019s getting harder to tell who are the good guys and who are the bad guys anymore. \u201cHe looked in the mirror and he went \u2018I\u2019m the enemy.\u2019 The line of good and evil runs through each one of us,\u201d Patinkin said.\n\nPatinkin said that anyone who is prepared to take a life is placing themselves above the law and believing that they are God. While he was talking about war and peace, he could very well have been talking about the right-wing trope about \u201cgood guys with guns.\u201d\n\nBut Patinkin was just getting started. \u201cIt is essential that we stop this paradigm of violence that Saul has learned,\u201d he said passionately. \u201cBy that I mean, it hasn\u2019t worked. It hasn\u2019t worked, this violence \u2018an eye for an eye.\u2019 We have to come up with a new paradigm \u2026 and what is that new paradigm if war isn\u2019t working? Where you spend $4 trillion on this war. What is being spent on the marginalized people in humanity? All of these wonderful Muslim men and women that have no education, no opportunity, no good schooling and so what do they do? They look for someone else who\u2019s saying \u2018will give you a better life.\u2019 Why aren\u2019t we talking that money that\u2019s used for bombs, and making schools and hospitals and homes and opportunity?\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"This fearmongering and hatred that's going on by people running for the President is so misguided,\" Patinkin said VIDEO", "title": "Mandy Patinkin pleads with Colbert\u2019s audience to resist Islamophobic fearmongering: \u201cWhen you meet these women and children you will not be afraid\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"This fearmongering and hatred that's going on by people running for the President is so misguided,\" Patinkin said VIDEO", "title": "Mandy Patinkin pleads with Colbert\u2019s audience to resist Islamophobic fearmongering: \u201cWhen you meet these women and children you will not be afraid\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/19/mandy_patinkin_pleads_with_colberts_audience_to_resist_islamophobic_fearmongering_when_you_meet_these_women_and_children_you_will_not_be_afraid/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-19-at-4.28.08-AM.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"This fearmongering and hatred that's going on by people running for the President is so misguided,\" Patinkin said VIDEO", "title": "Mandy Patinkin pleads with Colbert\u2019s audience to resist Islamophobic fearmongering: \u201cWhen you meet these women and children you will not be afraid\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/Screen-Shot-2015-12-19-at-4.28.08-AM.png", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Sarah Burris", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, anti-muslim bigotry, Donald Trump, Homeland, humanism, Islamophobia, late show, mandy patinkin, refugee crisis, Stephen Colbert", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Saul realizes it\u2019s getting harder to tell who are the good guys and who are the bad guys anymore.\nPatinkin was just as serious as when he avenged his father\u2019s death in the \u201cPrincess Bride,\u201d which Ted Cruz keeps quoting.\nRight off the bat, Patinkin began addressing the nature of good and evil and the models through which we decide to go to war.\nWhile he was talking about war and peace, he could very well have been talking about the right-wing trope about \u201cgood guys with guns.\u201dBut Patinkin was just getting started.\nAll of these wonderful Muslim men and women that have no education, no opportunity, no good schooling and so what do they do?"}
