Trump didn\u2019t do much to inspire confidence on Monday.\n\nRelated: Trump \u2013 Turn US Military Into the World\u2019s Rent-a-Cop\n\nLess than two weeks before, on March 10, at the most recent Republican presidential debate, Trump was asked about his position on using U.S. troops to fight ISIS. His answer was clear: The U.S. should send in troops, wipe out ISIS, and get out.\n\n\u201cWe really have no choice,\u201d the GOP\u2019s leading contender for the presidential nomination said. \u201cWe have to knock out ISIS. We have to knock the hell out of them. We have to get rid of it. And then come back and rebuild our country, which is falling apart. We have no choice.\u201d\n\nAsked how many troops he would commit, Trump said, \u201cI would listen to the generals, but I'm hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000. We have to knock them out fast \u2026 So, the answer is we have to knock them out. We have to knock them out fast. And we have to get back home. And we have to rebuild our country, which is falling apart.\u201d\n\nBut in an interview with The Washington Post editorial board on Monday, Trump denied having said that he would commit troops.\n\nRelated: The Secret of trump\u2019s Self-Funded Campaign \u2013 It\u2019s Dirt Cheap\n\nDeputy editorial page editor Jackson Diehl asked the billionaire, \u201cCould I ask you about ISIS, speaking of making commitments, because you talked recently about possibly sending 20 or 30,000 troops and \u2014\u201c\n\nInterrupting Diehl, Trump said, \u201cNo I didn\u2019t, oh no no no, okay, I know what you\u2019re saying. There was a question asked to me. I said that the military, the generals have said that 20- to 30,000. They said, would you send troops? I didn\u2019t say send 20,000. I said, well the generals are saying you\u2019d need because they, what would it take to wipe out ISIS, I said pretty much exactly this, I said the generals, the military is saying you would need 20- to 30,000 troops, but I didn\u2019t say that I would send them.\u201d\n\nAsked if he would commit troops if in fact some generals told him that was what was needed to defeat ISIS, Trump let fly with this barrage of words:\n\n\u201cI find it hard to go along with \u2014 I mention that as an example because it\u2019s so much. That\u2019s why I brought that up. But a couple of people have said the same thing as you, where they said, \u2018Did I say that,\u2019 and I said that that\u2019s a number that I heard would be needed. I would find it very, very hard to send that many troops to take care of it. I would say this, I would put tremendous pressure on other countries that are over there to use their troops and I\u2019d give them tremendous air supporters and support, because we have to get rid of ISIS, okay, just so \u2014 we have to get rid of ISIS. I would get other countries to become very much involved.\u201d\n\nRelated: New Levels of Chutzpah from Trump in D.C.\n\nBottom line takeaway from the Post interview is that Trump\u2019s position today is the opposite of the one he took at the Republican debate less than two weeks ago.\n\nTrump clarified his new position, sort of, hours later when he was interviewed by Wolf Blitzer on CNN. Turns out he might be in favor of the number of troops he cited in the debate \u2013 just not their source.\n\n\u201cI wouldn't deploy 20,000,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d get people from that part of the world to put up the troops, and I\u2019d certainly give them air power and air support and some military support \u2026 I would never ever put up 20,000 or 30,000.\u201d\n\nAlso yesterday, trump artfully dodged another ISIS related question from the Post.\n\nRelated: Arizona and Utah Provide First Big Test of the \u2018Stop Trump\u2019 Movement\n\nWhen Fred Ryan, the paper\u2019s publisher and CEO, asked whether he would consider using a tactical nuclear weapon against ISIS forces, he began, \u201cI don\u2019t want to use, I don\u2019t want to start the process of nuclear. Remember the one thing that everybody has said, I\u2019m a counterpuncher. Rubio hit me. Bush hit me. When I said low energy, he\u2019s a low-energy individual, he hit me first. I spent, by the way he spent 18 million dollars\u2019 worth of negative ads on me. That\u2019s putting \u2013\u201d\n\nRyan interrupted, \u201cThis is about ISIS. You would not use a tactical nuclear weapon against ISIS?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing, this is a very good looking group of people here,\u201d Trump said. \u201cCould I just go around so I know who the hell I\u2019m talking to?\u201d\n\nAnd the conversation never got back to the subject of using nuclear weapons against ISIS.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Donald Trump yesterday completely reversed himself on whether or not he would commit U.S. combat troops to the fight against ISIS, even as he bragged that he has the \u201csteady hands\u201d necessary to manage the country\u2019s foreign policy in an increasingly dangerous world.", "title": "Trump Does a U-Turn on How He\u2019d Fight ISIS", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/22/Trump-Does-U-Turn-How-He-d-Fight-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump-aipac_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/22/Trump-Does-U-Turn-How-He-d-Fight-ISIS", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump-aipac_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Donald Trump yesterday completely reversed himself on whether or not he would commit U.S. combat troops to the fight against ISIS, even as he bragged that he has the \u201csteady hands\u201d necessary to manage the country\u2019s foreign policy in an increasingly dangerous world.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Trump didn\u2019t do much to inspire confidence on Monday.\nI didn\u2019t say send 20,000.\nHis answer was clear: The U.S. should send in troops, wipe out ISIS, and get out.\nRelated: Trump \u2013 Turn US Military Into the World\u2019s Rent-a-CopLess than two weeks before, on March 10, at the most recent Republican presidential debate, Trump was asked about his position on using U.S. troops to fight ISIS.\nThey said, would you send troops?"}
