But federal officials finally relented last week and added a \u201cwindow shopping\u201d feature that displays data on deductibles. For policies offered in the federal exchange, as in many states, the annual deductible often tops $5,000 for an individual and $10,000 for a couple. \u2026 Mark A. York, a 60-year-old freelance writer in Hailey, Idaho, said he began shopping after he received a letter saying that his current insurance policy would be canceled because it did not meet the requirements of the health care law. In the exchange, he said, he found policies with premiums similar to what he is now paying, $440 a month, but \u201cthe deductibles were so high \u2014 $4,000 to $6,000 a year \u2014 that it defeats the purpose of having insurance.\u201d \u2026 Federal officials often point to premiums as evidence that the health care law has made insurance affordable. \u201cNearly six in 10 uninsured Americans can pay less than $100 a month for coverage in the health insurance marketplace,\u201d Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, has said.\n\nExcept that those miraculously low premiums aren\u2019t really much of a favor if they\u2019re accompanied by much higher deductibles, co-payments, and drastically limited provider networks, are they? There\u2019s been a sizable and obviously deliberate lack of straightforwardness going on with this law, and those aren\u2019t the only hidden and/or \u201cunexpected\u201d costs that consumers might now find themselves facing, as the WSJ reported the other day:\n\nAmericans with chronic illnesses\u2014who are expected to be among the biggest beneficiaries of the health law\u2014face widely varying out-of-pocket drug costs that could be obscured on the new insurance exchanges. Under the law, patients can\u2019t be denied coverage due to existing conditions or charged higher rates than healthier peers. The law also sets an annual out-of-pocket maximum of up to $6,350 for individuals and $12,700 for families, after which insurers pay the full tab. But depending on the coverage they select, some patients on expensive drug regimens could reach that level fast. Some medications for conditions including hepatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV and cancer can retail for thousands of dollars a month, and some plans require patients to pay as much as 50% of the cost.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Revelations.", "title": "NYT: My, many of these ObamaCare premiums aren\u2019t really as low as they seem, are they?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/12/09/nyt-my-many-of-these-obamacare-premiums-arent-really-as-low-as-they-seem-are-they/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-09T14:41:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-09T17:07:34+00:00"}, "keywords": "costs, deductibles, health care, insurance, New York Times, ObamaCare, premiums,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2442\"", "article_summary": "NYT: My, many of these ObamaCare premiums aren\u2019t really as low as they seem, are they?\nExcept that those miraculously low premiums aren\u2019t really much of a favor if they\u2019re accompanied by much higher deductibles, co-payments, and drastically limited provider networks, are they?\nBut federal officials finally relented last week and added a \u201cwindow shopping\u201d feature that displays data on deductibles.\nUnder the law, patients can\u2019t be denied coverage due to existing conditions or charged higher rates than healthier peers.\n\u201cNearly six in 10 uninsured Americans can pay less than $100 a month for coverage in the health insurance marketplace,\u201d Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, has said."}
