Division St., according to building permits.\n\nIt will have 15 beds and offer 24-hour care every day with lab and X-ray services on site. Rockwood spokeswoman Jill Fix said the facility will serve patients who need more help than urgent care clinics are equipped to offer, yet who don\u2019t require the full-blown trauma care given by hospital emergency rooms.\n\nRockwood has added to its emergency department at Valley Hospital in the past five years and is finishing a major remodel and expansion of its emergency room at Deaconess Hospital.\n\nIt already has six urgent care centers in the Spokane area.\n\nWithin the past three years Providence has opened three of its own urgent care centers. The organization also completed a significant expansion of its emergency department at Sacred Heart Medical Center and made changes at Holy Family Hospital.\n\nNow Providence is trying to ensure the best use of its hospital emergency units where 141,047 patients received treatment last year.\n\nIts urgent care centers are helping with that triage effort, spokeswoman Liz DeRuyter said.\n\nIn 2013, Providence\u2019s fledgling urgent cares treated 23,261 patients. Last year, the number almost tripled to 66,853 patients.\n\n\u201cAll three urgent care sites have exceeded our expectations and projections,\u201d DeRuyter said. \u201cDemand is strong.\u201d\n\nThis fall CHAS will open an urgent care center in Spokane Valley at 1512 N. Vercler Road in a building the organization bought for $2.3 million. An existing clinic in Spokane Valley will relocate.\n\nCHAS Health already operates one urgent care center in north Spokane near Holy Family Hospital. The clinic serves more than 80 patients daily from November to March during the busy flu season.\n\nThe Spokane Valley urgent care will provide another option for patients who have difficulty getting to the north Spokane facility, Wilson said.\n\nCHAS Health\u2019s existing primary care clinic and pharmacy in Spokane Valley will also move this year to a $4.25 million building at 15812 E. Indiana Ave.\n\nAlong with a new clinic in Spokane\u2019s Perry Street neighborhood, CHAS is expanding its capacity and geographic reach.\n\n\u201cOur current facilities are maxed out,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cThis also allows us to serve specific neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nCHAS Health expects to serve about 6,000 patients at its Perry Street Clinic, which will open in late March. The primary care clinic will open in rented space at 817 S. Perry St., Suite B, and will include a pharmacy.\n\nWilson said the association is also interested in opening a clinic in Cheney in the future but hasn\u2019t secured funding.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Health care organizations are investing millions of dollars in emergency and urgent care centers across the Spokane region to treat the growing number of patients who have gained insurance and access to health care.
