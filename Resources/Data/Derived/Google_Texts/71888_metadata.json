Now, two guys are working on a \u201ccaffeine bracelet\u201d that would act in the same way as a nicotine patch \u2014 gradually providing you with a steady flow of caffeine throughout the day, without the highs and lows of coffee consumption. It\u2019s called the Joule caffeine bracelet.\n\n\u201cThe Joule caffeine bracelet is a bracelet with a slot for you to snap on a transdermal caffeine patch,\u201d the creators write on their Indiegogo page. \u201cThese patches work in a similar fashion to a nicotine patch or other transdermal medication patches. The caffeine is administered gradually for a steady supply of caffeine and energy without any of the typical energy crashes, jitters or other negative effects of consuming your caffeine through beverages.\u201d\n\nThere are a lot of good things about coffee; research has shown that moderate coffee consumption lowers the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, cancer, and types of dementia like Alzheimer\u2019s disease. That being said, however, there\u2019s also another side to coffee; some studies have associated caffeine with anxiety and depression. We all know the jittery feeling of drinking too much coffee on an empty stomach, heightening our anxiety and impairing our focus.\n\nWhile Joule would provide the user with 56 mg of caffeine over the course of four hours, it\u2019s intended to do it slowly and consistently, in order to avoid coffee highs and crashes. This is done through transdermal administration, or the transmitting of chemicals through the skin and into the bloodstream, like nicotine patches. Transdermal administration only works if the chemicals\u2019 molecules are tiny enough to enter the skin, and caffeine happens to be such a chemical.\n\nThough there are several ways a drug or chemical can pass through skin, the main way involves seeping through the phospholipids' membranes and cytoplasm of dead keratinocytes in the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the skin. In order to go through the entire stratum corneum, the chemical has to pass through several layers of each cell very slowly. Transdermal administration is usually done with patches or gels.\n\nWould the caffeine bracelet really work? If caffeine can truly be administered transdermally, then in theory, yes. It\u2019s up to you to decide whether you want to give up the smooth taste of a fresh roast every morning.\n\nAs for the caffeine bracelet\u2019s name, \u201ca joule is a unit of energy,\u201d the creators write. \u201cOur bracelets are designed to GIVE you energy and thus we thought \u2018Joule\u2019 would be a perfect name.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "joule, caffeine, bracelet, provides, steady, stream, energy, throughout, day, how, transdermal", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The caffeine bracelet would provide caffeine to the user via transdermal administration, similar to a nicotine patch.", "title": "This Caffeine Bracelet Can Be Your Substitute For A Cup O' Joe", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/caffeine-bracelet-transdermal-administration-372402", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/02/05/joule-caffeine-bracelet-provides-steady-stream-energy-throughout-day-how-transdermal.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The caffeine bracelet would provide caffeine to the user via transdermal administration, similar to a nicotine patch.", "title": "This Caffeine Bracelet Can Be Your Substitute For A Cup O' Joe", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/caffeine-bracelet-transdermal-administration-372402", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2016/02/05/joule-caffeine-bracelet-provides-steady-stream-energy-throughout-day-how-transdermal.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/02/05/joule-caffeine-bracelet-provides-steady-stream-energy-throughout-day-how-transdermal.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2016-02-05T15:03:01-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-05T15:03:00-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The caffeine bracelet would provide caffeine to the user via transdermal administration, similar to a nicotine patch."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd218f\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe Joule caffeine bracelet is a bracelet with a slot for you to snap on a transdermal caffeine patch,\u201d the creators write on their Indiegogo page.\nIt\u2019s called the Joule caffeine bracelet.\nWould the caffeine bracelet really work?\nNow, two guys are working on a \u201ccaffeine bracelet\u201d that would act in the same way as a nicotine patch \u2014 gradually providing you with a steady flow of caffeine throughout the day, without the highs and lows of coffee consumption.\nAs for the caffeine bracelet\u2019s name, \u201ca joule is a unit of energy,\u201d the creators write."}
