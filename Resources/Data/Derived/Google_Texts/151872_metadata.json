Another 14 hospitals Horizon designated as \"tier one\" facilities also agreed to accept lower reimbursement in exchange for higher patient volume.\n\nThe remaining 36 hospitals in the state, who said they were blindsided by the game-changing development, demanded to know why they were left out. With more than 3.7 million people, Horizon wields considerable buying power, and the excluded hospitals -- many of them Catholic, located in cities or serve a sizable number of uninsured and Medicaid clients -- say they fear they will lose a substantial amount of revenue.\n\n\"Consumers deserve clear answers about how this new OMNIA Alliance and the tiers will affect their access to care, and safety-net health care providers deserve to know how this will impact their ability to serve patients and their long-term viability,\" Sen. Joseph Vitale (D-Middlesex), chairman of the Senate Health, Human Services and Senior Services Committee who called the hearing. \"We welcome innovation that will reduce health care costs, but we have to be cautious in making sure that the changes will not adversely impact patients or hospitals in New Jersey, especially those in medically underserved communities.\"\n\nHere what is known so far based on interviews with Horizon officials and written material they provided.\n\nQ: Why did Horizon create OMNIA and the tiered network plan?\n\nA: This is about curbing health insurance costs and providing cheaper options to employers and consumers, Minal Patel said, Horizon's senior vice president and chief strategy officer. He said 30 percent of health care costs are wasted on repeated and unnecessary tests and procedures, and hospital readmissions because patients were not managed properly after discharge.\n\nQ: How were the OMNIA hospitals selected?\n\nA: Horizon examined Medicare data and looked for the hospitals with the lowest readmission rates and best scores on patient, safety and quality measures. Hospitals needed to offer a range of inpatient, outpatient and post-acute care services. They had to be using or prepared to use a \"value-based\" payment model that rewards preventive care. They had to score high on patient satisfaction surveys. Horizon also favored the largest hospitals and systems, including those that serve a sizable number of Horizon members.\n\nQ: Which hospitals make up the OMNIA Alliance?\n\nA: Chilton Medical Center; Clara Maass Medical Center; Community Medical Center; Hackensack UMC in Hackensack, Mountainside and Pascack Valley; Hunterdon Medical Center; Inspira Medical Center Elmer, Vineland and Woodbury; Jersey City Medical Center; Monmouth Medical Center and its Southern Campus; Morristown Medical Center; Newark Beth Israel Medical Center; Newton Medical Center; Overlook Medical Center, Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Rahway, Somerset, New Brunswick and Hamilton; Saint Barnabas Medical Center.\n\nHackettstown Medical Center will be added after it is acquired by Atlantic Health.\n\nQ: How were the Tier 1 hospitals chosen?\n\nA: They met \"geographic considerations\" so the OMNIA policyholder would be able to find hospitals and doctors across the state.\n\nQ: Which hospitals are in Tier 1?\n\nA: AtlantiCare in Pomona and Atlantic City; Cape Regional Medical Center; Cooper University Hospital; Englewood Hospital; Shore Medical Canter; St. Joseph's Medical Center, Paterson and Wayne; University Medical Center of Princeton at Plainsboro; Bayshore Community Hospital; Jersey Shore Medical Center; Ocean Medical Center, Review Medical Center, Southern Ocean Medical Center. There are 14 hospitals in Tier 1, not 12, as Horizon originally reported.\n\nQ: Where do the remaining hospitals stand with Horizon?\n\nA: People who purchase an OMNIA/Tier 1 plan can still use hospitals in Horizon's existing network. These will be known as \"Tier 2\" facilities. But consumers will miss out on the discounts. Horizon will continue to offer these existing plans and hospitals and physicians will receive the same reimbursements as they do today.\n\nQ: Is Horizon saying Tier 2 hospitals offer inferior quality?\n\nA: Not at all, Patel said. They can and often do provide outstanding inpatient care. Where a Tier 2 hospital may provide excellent care to the patient who fell and broke a hip, the OMNIA/Tier 1 facilities will work to prevent the hip fracture. They will make sure the patient had osteoporosis screening and a home assessment is done to look for fall risks, he said.\n\nQ: Why is there only one Catholic hospital in OMNIA/Tier 1?\n\nA: \"We did not take into account religious affiliation or tax status. . .We looked at who will be in the best position to avoid wasted medical spending, such as unnecessary tests,\" Patel said. The data used to evaluate the hospitals \"is publicly available. The outcomes were the outcomes. There was no desire one way or another to include or exclude\" Catholic hospitals, he said.\n\nQ: Which doctors will be included in the OMNIA and Tier 1 plans?\n\nA: There will be about 24,000 physicians and other health providers in OMNIA Tier 1. This includes about 600 doctors of the Summit Medical Group in north and central Jersey. The rest are doctors and other providers who work in practices, many of which have \"clinical affiliations\" with at least one Tier 1 hospital. Check to see if your doctor or hospital is in Tier 1 by visiting doctorfinder.horizonblue.com.\n\n(An earlier version of this article based on information from Horizon said physicians with hospital admitting privileges at Tier 1 hospitals were automatically Tier 1 doctors. That is not true.)\n\nQ: What if I want to use an out-of-state hospital or doctor?\n\nA: The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, popular in N.J., is included in Tier 2. Companies with 100 or more employees can offer a \"blue card\" plan that will allow people to buy a policy covering out-of-state doctors and hospitals at an additional cost. In cases involving a complicated procedure or rare condition, Horizon will evaluate whether a provider outside N.J. is necessary and will be covered at the reduced-cost Tier 1 level.\n\nQ: Horizon has not revealed rates. Why not?\n\nA: The open enrollment period for plans available on the Obamacare exchange begins later this month and the federal government says products and their prices may not be revealed until then. OMNIA will be sold on the exchange. But Horizon CEO Robert Marino has said consumers will pay 15 percent less for their premiums by buying an OMNIA plan compared to the plans available today.\n\nSusan K.
