That's not like living in the community.\"\n\n\"They were kind of set up for failure,\" she said. \"They weren't given a lot of support, a lot of services --- and then before you know it, they're back in the hospital.\"\n\nThe settlement came as Gov. Rick Scott calls for more coordination and better streamlining of the state's mental-health services. Last week Scott said he'll propose more than $19 million for mental-health and substance-abuse treatment in his recommended budget for the fiscal year that will start July 1 --- including $12.8 million for community behavioral health services that help people transition from state facilities to their communities.\n\nScott also signed executive orders in July and earlier this month creating pilot programs in Broward, Pinellas and Alachua counties to conduct inventories of all state programs that address mental-health needs.\n\nDepartment of Children and Families spokeswoman Michelle Glady said the budget items were developed several months in advance of the settlement agreement.\n\nThe settlement requires the Department of Children and Families to ask the Legislature for funding for a pilot program that would make better use of what is known as the Florida Assertive Community Treatment program to serve more people with varying degrees of needs.\n\nCurrently, FACT teams provide intensive wraparound services --- counseling, case management, housing, medication and transportation. But not everyone who transitions from a mental hospital to community-based care continues to need all those services.\n\n\"A review of the FACT discharge data has shown that very few FACT participants ever leave the program as a result of increased stability and subsequent transition to a lower level of care,\" said the settlement agreement.\n\nIt also noted that the Department of Children and Families \"hypothesizes (this) may be occurring because FACT participants who clinically and functionally are ready for lower levels of care may nonetheless not be transitioned because they risk losing their housing subsidy.\"\n\nBy the terms of the settlement, participants in the pilot program will receive vouchers allowing them to buy services and community supports, including rental assistance. The department will provide an assessment tool to determine the extent of their needs.\n\nAccording to the department, the average cost per year of treating someone at a civil state mental health hospital is $103,437, while the average cost per year for FACT services in $12,540.\n\nCurrently there are 31 FACT teams across the state, each mandated to serve no more than 100 people. Each FACT team includes a psychiatrist, a peer specialist and a team leader, along with an independent advisory committee to help the team develop resources in its community.\n\nUnder the settlement agreement, Paris said, the pilot program will be launched in Duval and Hillsborough counties.\n\n\"None of this is going to happen overnight, but it's a start,\" she said.", "article_metadata": {"category": "HNF Stories", "description": "The state Department of Children and Families has agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by Disability Rights Florida and move toward providing more options", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/settlement-could-offer-more-options-people-mental-illness", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201507/DCFLogo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The state Department of Children and Families has agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by Disability Rights Florida and move toward providing more options", "title": "Settlement Could Offer More Options For People With Mental Illness"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Margie Menzel of the News Service of Florida", "wordCount": 683, "dc": {"title": "Settlement Could Offer More Options For People With Mental Illness"}, "nid": 12133, "datePublished": "2015-09-29", "story_id": 444427407, "keywords": "mental illness, Department of Children and Families, Disbility Rights of Florida, Americans with Disabilities Act", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c4a\"", "article_summary": "Paris said that in 2013, advocates noticed a pattern at Florida State Hospital in Chattahoochee, Northeast Florida Hospital in Macclenny, and the South Florida State Hospital in Pembroke Pines.\nUnder the settlement agreement, Paris said, the pilot program will be launched in Duval and Hillsborough counties.\nBy the terms of the settlement, participants in the pilot program will receive vouchers allowing them to buy services and community supports, including rental assistance.\nBut not everyone who transitions from a mental hospital to community-based care continues to need all those services.\nThe state Department of Children and Families has agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by Disability Rights Florida and move toward providing more options for people who are mentally ill to live in their communities instead of in state mental hospitals."}
