Gross\u2019 daughter saw a picture of the other girl with her ex-boyfriend and the two girls exchanged messages over social media. The boy was actually Higgins\u2019 cousin. Gross went to the school to complain that her daughter was being harassed by Higgins but Higgins\u2019 mother says school officials decided it was actually the other way around, suspending the cop\u2019s daughter.\n\nIs this where the officer decided to step it up as a mom and teach her daughter a lesson about bullying? Not quite. Via the Daily News:\n\nWhen Haggins and her friend walked outside the main door later that day [after Gross came to the school to complain and had her daughter suspended], she said, she saw Gross' daughter jump out of a silver Dodge Charger.\n\n\n\n\"She said, 'Mom, that's her right there!' \" Haggins recalled. \"Her mom got out of the car and said, 'Sure, you all want to fight over an autistic boy, go ahead and fight.' \"\n\n\n\nHaggins-Montgomery said the boy is not autistic.\n\n\n\nHaggins said she and the other girl \"got to fighting\" and were \"throwing punches\" while Gross and her son watched by the car.\n\n\n\nHaggins recalls hearing Gross' son say during the brawl: \"Mom, don't jump in there, it's not your fight.\"\n\n\n\nGross didn't listen, Haggins said. \"I was beating her up, and her mom jumped in and hit me in my eye,\" she said. \"That's when everyone else started breaking it up.\"\n\n\n\nDuring the fight, one of Haggins' friends called her mother.\n\n\n\n\"I hear her girlfriend say 'They jumpin' Tashiyya, they jumpin' Tashiyya!' \" Haggins-Montgomery said. \"All I can do is panic because I can hear my child screaming 'Her mom, her mom hit me!' \"\n\n\n\nHaggins-Montgomery said she learned from a police supervisor who responded to the fight that Gross is a cop.\n\n\n\n\"Even if she didn't want to be a cop that day, she could have been a parent and been like, 'No. You don't do stuff like that,' \" Haggins-Montgomery said. \"You don't jump in a kids' fight. What gave you the gall to do that? You're a police officer. I'm sure they train y'all on different things like this.\"\n\n\u201cMore training\u201d may likely be the exact response of the police department to the case.
