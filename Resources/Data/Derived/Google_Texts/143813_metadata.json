Ken Calvert (R-Calif.) said in a statement. His subcommittee will consider the bill at a hearing on Wednesday.\n\nThe budget deal approved by Congress in December funded the EPA at $8.1 billion during 2015 \u2014 a $60 million cut from 2014 \u2014 and kept staffing at around 1989 levels. That deal did not block major EPA rule-making.\n\nPresident Obama has called for a $500 million increase in EPA funding next year.\n\nConservation groups hit the appropriations bill quickly on Tuesday.\n\n\"This is a draconian proposal,\" Friends of the Earth Climate and Energy campaigner Lukas Ross said in a statement. \"Agencies like the EPA are a crucial line of defense between polluters and our air and water. Congress should give these agencies the support they deserve instead of treating them as props in political theatre.\u201d\n\nOverall, the GOP's proposed interior and environment appropriations bill spends $30.17 billion next fiscal year, $246 million less than current levels and $3 billion less than what Obama requested.\n\nThe bill bumps up funding for wildfire prevention, Native American programs and the Office of Surface Mining. It passes on small cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service, and includes a provision blocking Endangered Species Act rule-making on the greater sage grouse.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "House appropriators want to use a funding bill to block several controversial EPA rules, committee Republicans announced Tuesday.", "description": "House appropriators want to use a funding bill to block several controversial EPA rules, committee Republicans announced Tuesday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Devin Henry", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "House appropriators want to use a funding bill to block several controversial EPA rules, committee Republicans announced Tuesday.", "title": "GOP appropriators look to block EPA rules", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/244395-gop-appropriators-look-to-block-epa-rules", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-09T12:24:15-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-06-09T12:24-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/244395-gop-appropriators-look-to-block-epa-rules", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-09T10:45-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Devin Henry", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Appropriations,Ken Calvert,Environmental Protection Agency", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-09T10:45:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-09T12:24:15-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/244395-gop-appropriators-look-to-block-epa-rules", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "House appropriators want to use a funding bill to block several controversial EPA rules, committee Republicans announced Tuesday.", "card": "summary", "title": "GOP appropriators look to block EPA rules"}, "dcterms.title": "GOP appropriators look to block EPA rules"}, "article_summary": "House appropriators want to use a funding bill to block several controversial Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules, Republicans on the committee announced Tuesday.\nPresident Obama has called for a $500 million increase in EPA funding next year.\nThe bill cuts funding for the EPA by $718 million, or 9 percent, and caps staffing levels at the agency to 15,000, the lowest level since 1989.\nThat deal did not block major EPA rule-making.\nThe Appropriations Committee's 2016 interior and environment funding bill would block the EPA's proposed greenhouse gas emissions rules for new and existing power plants, as well as its ability to define which waterways it is allowed to regulate."}
