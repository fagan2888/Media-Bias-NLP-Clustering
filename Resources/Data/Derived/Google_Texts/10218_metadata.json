Those objections were quickly countered by The Times\u2019s executive editor, Dean Baquet, also on Medium, a blogging site.\n\nMuch commentary from elsewhere ensued, though whether it added anything definitive to the disagreement is doubtful. Amazon still objects to the article\u2019s characterizations and details. The Times stands by it proudly. I had my say on it last summer and won\u2019t add to it here, except to say that seeing the executive editor respond to criticism on Medium and also on Facebook was a first, and an effective one. (He told me Tuesday that The Times\u2019s response to Mr. Carney\u2019s \u201cbill of particulars\u201d was nearly complete after weeks of research, which explained how quickly it was posted Monday.)\n\nIs the back-and-forth now complete? If there\u2019s more from Amazon, of substance, \u201cwe might respond publicly again,\u201d Mr. Baquet said.\n\nLess heavily reported on, but more interesting to me, is the disagreement about Jonathan Mahler\u2019s New York Times Magazine cover story that raises questions about the circumstances involved in Osama bin Laden\u2019s death.\n\nThe Huffington Post\u2019s Michael Calderone does a very thorough job of laying out the conflict over this story \u2014 with prominent national security reporters in Washington, including some in The Times\u2019s own Washington bureau, voicing objections. (A Times columnist, Joe Nocera, came down on the magazine\u2019s side.)\n\nAmong those who have written sharply critical stories about the piece are the author Mark Bowden, who wrote in Vanity Fair, Greg Miller of The Washington Post and Peter Bergen of CNN. Mr. Bergen, the author of \u201cManhunt: The Ten-Year Search for Bin Laden \u2014 From 9/11 to Abbottabad,\u201d called the magazine story \u201cbizarre,\u201d and argued that \u201cthe key sources and witnesses are in agreement about the main points of the narrative.\u201d He called Seymour Hersh\u2019s reporting that calls that narrative into question \u201ca farrago of nonsense\u201d that contradicts common sense.\n\nThe critics say that it is inaccurate and is misleading to suggest that the story line on how Bin Laden died is still up in the air, or that it should be; in fact, it is mostly settled history, based on exhaustive reporting. Many in The Times\u2019s Washington bureau felt the same way, with the added frustration of knowing that the magazine story came from their own organization.\n\nEric Schmitt, a national security reporter in The Times\u2019s Washington bureau, said he agrees with the points made in the three critical pieces mentioned here. He added: \u201cThis article has struck a nerve among national security and foreign policy reporters at The New York Times, and elsewhere, like few I\u2019ve seen in my three-plus decades at the paper.\u201d\n\nIn addition, a reader, Jim O\u2019Donnell of Tempe, Ariz., wrote to me in agreement with the critics, including a reference to Mr. Hersh: \u201cThat is the strangest article I\u2019ve ever read in The Times, an extreme case of the story that asserts a wholly indefensible proposition by covering the heck out of a marginalized figure who is asserting the proposition.\u201d\n\nMr. Baquet said he reassured Washington reporters and editors in a conference call on Monday that he did not see Mr. Mahler\u2019s magazine piece as an attack on their reporting in any way.\n\nCritics of the story \u201care reading it wrong. This was not a national security investigative story,\u201d Mr. Baquet said. Nor was it a critique of The Times\u2019s own coverage. \u201cIt was a media story,\u201d he said, and, seen that way, \u201ca very good one.\u201d\n\nMr. Mahler told me that the response he has received from the general readership has been very positive and that \u201cthe vast majority understand that this was a media-process story about how history gets written.\u201d\n\nEssentially, Mr. Baquet said, \u201cthis is a story that\u2019s been told from so many perspectives that it\u2019s hard for Americans to get straight what happened.\u201d Mr. Baquet included in those perspectives not only Mr. Hersh\u2019s against-the-grain reporting for The London Review of Books but also the film \u201cZero Dark Thirty,\u201d which he characterized as \u201cfull of inaccuracies.\u201d (The Times\u2019s own veteran foreign correspondent, Carlotta Gall, added another facet in a piece she wrote for the magazine last spring, agreeing with one important element of Mr. Hersh\u2019s reporting on this subject.)\n\nBut, Mr. Baquet said, although Times Washington reporters were consulted, \u201cthey should have been consulted more.\u201d A remaining issue, he said, is something of a paradox: that The Times Magazine both needs to remain independent of The Times\u2019s newsroom in its editorial approach but also to consult with the newsroom when appropriate.\n\nThe latter didn\u2019t happen enough here, Mr. Baquet said, but he plans to take steps to make sure that it does in the future. That deeper consultation might have made clearer which aspects of this recent history truly are still up in the air \u2014 and that a great deal is indeed well settled.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151021080058, "twitter": {"description": "The executive editor disputes criticism of a magazine cover story but agrees that Washington reporters should have been consulted more.", "title": "Baquet on Bin Laden Story: Critics 'Reading It Wrong'", "url": "http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/baquet-on-bin-laden-story-critics-reading-it-wrong/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "creator": "@sulliview", "card": "summary"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000003989860, "CLMST": "Margaret Sullivan", "org": "New York Times", "keywords": "Baquet Dean,bin Laden Osama,Mahler Jonathan,New York Times,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/publiceditor/Baquet on Bin Laden Story: Critics 'Reading It Wrong' ( 20151021 )", "description": "The executive editor disputes criticism of a magazine cover story but agrees that Washington reporters should have been consulted more.", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Margaret Sullivan", "SCG": "The Public Editor", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/publiceditor", "per": "Baquet, Dean;bin Laden, Osama;Mahler, Jonathan", "byl": "Margaret Sullivan", "BN": "publiceditor", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/publiceditor/post", "news_keywords": "Dean Baquet,New York Times,Osama bin Laden", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 21, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1445428858, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/thepubliceditor/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2015-10-21T15:26:22-04:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "utime": 20151021152622, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20151021, "pdate": 20151021, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Public Editor's Journal", "description": "The executive editor disputes criticism of a magazine cover story but agrees that Washington reporters should have been consulted more.", "title": "Baquet on Bin Laden Story: Critics 'Reading It Wrong'", "url": "http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/baquet-on-bin-laden-story-critics-reading-it-wrong/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/baquet-on-bin-laden-story-critics-reading-it-wrong/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Baquet on Bin Laden Story: Critics 'Reading It Wrong'", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 21, 2015"}, "article_summary": "The latter didn\u2019t happen enough here, Mr. Baquet said, but he plans to take steps to make sure that it does in the future.\nIf there\u2019s more from Amazon, of substance, \u201cwe might respond publicly again,\u201d Mr. Baquet said.\nThis was not a national security investigative story,\u201d Mr. Baquet said.\nEric Schmitt, a national security reporter in The Times\u2019s Washington bureau, said he agrees with the points made in the three critical pieces mentioned here.\nLess heavily reported on, but more interesting to me, is the disagreement about Jonathan Mahler\u2019s New York Times Magazine cover story that raises questions about the circumstances involved in Osama bin Laden\u2019s death."}
