That includes repealing the Affordable Care Act, repealing President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulations.\n\nRELATED: Liz Cheney and Philip Perry: A prominent couple in Washington D.C.\n\nCheney says she believes climate change is \u201cjunk science,\u201d and that EPA\u2019s regulations hurt more than just Wyoming\u2019s energy industry.\n\n\u201cFolks are very, very concerned about what\u2019s happening in Washington,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cThey\u2019re concerned about what\u2019s happening to our freedom. Concerned, especially, about the energy industry.\u201d\n\nThe convention\u2019s main event takes place tonight with the selection of the party\u2019s 14 delegates for the Republican nominee for president. GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz is expected to speak at the convention in Casper tonight. Cruz took nine of 12 Wyoming GOP delegates in the party\u2019s caucuses.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of Wyoming Republicans are expected to attend the GOP convention in a state that is solidly red on the political map.\n\n\u201cWe need to take that business sense, that businessman common sense, and take it to D.C. and run it more like a business and less like a charity,\u201d U.S. House of Representative candidate Charlie Tyrrel of Casper said. \u201cWe\u2019re not a charity. That\u2019s what churches are supposed to do.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Wyoming Dem \u2018super-delegates\u2019 asked to rescind pledges for Clinton\n\nTyrrel, a former Powder River Basin coal miner and owner of Charlie\u2019s Pizza in Casper, touted his experience as a successful Wyoming businessman and his outsider status as never serving in the Legislature or working as an attorney. In an interview with WyoFile, Tyrrel said Wyoming\u2019s next U.S. representative needs to take common-sense businessman attributes to Washington D.C.\n\nBoth Cheney and Tyrrel say they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the system we had and work it better,\u201d Tyrrel said. \u201cThe system we had was not broken. It just wasn\u2019t necessarily there for everybody. But part of having a better system like that is working yourself into a better position in life and getting a job that has the better benefits.\u201d\n\nParty members hashed out drafts of party platforms on issues Friday, including the use of marijuana.\n\nAlthough the party still doesn\u2019t embrace legalization of medical or recreational use, some warned that arguments for the continued prohibition of marijuana are the same as arguments used to limit access to guns. Meanwhile, another committee in another room debated the Wyoming GOP party\u2019s stance on vaccinations, with some arguing that the government should not mandate what people put into their bodies regarding health concerns.\n\n\n\nOn the matter of \u201cfree exchange of ideas,\u201d one platform committee member warned against so-called safe zones for speech at universities. \u201cThere\u2019s no right to not be offended.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "WyoFile", "description": "The Wyoming GOP went to work on platform issues including vaccinations, eminent domain and marijuana policies while candidate hopefuls and their surrogates made their case for support Friday in Casper.", "title": "Liz Cheney: repeal EPA regs to help coal | WyoFile", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GOP-scene-2.jpg", "height": 544}, "url": "http://www.wyofile.com/blog/liz-cheney-repeal-epa-regs-help-coal/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WyoFile", "section": "Capitol Beat", "tag": "Wyoming GOP"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Wyoming GOP went to work on platform issues including vaccinations, eminent domain and marijuana policies while candidate hopefuls and their surrogates made their case for support Friday in Casper.", "creator": "@wyofile", "image": "http://www.wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/GOP-scene-2.jpg", "title": "Liz Cheney: repeal EPA regs to help coal | WyoFile", "site": "@wyofile", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "generator": "WooFramework 5.5.6", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cFolks are very, very concerned about what\u2019s happening in Washington,\u201d Cheney said.\nCruz took nine of 12 Wyoming GOP delegates in the party\u2019s caucuses.\n\u201cThere clearly are market conditions that are part of the problem,\u201d Cheney said regarding challenges to Wyoming\u2019s coal, oil and natural gas industries.\nBoth Cheney and Tyrrel say they want to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the system we had and work it better,\u201d Tyrrel said."}
