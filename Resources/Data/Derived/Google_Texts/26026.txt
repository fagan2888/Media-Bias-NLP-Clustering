Here's some things to remember before you head to the polls for Kentucky's general election, according to the Secretary of State's Office.

Do list

• Verify your voter registration status before you head to the polls. You can look it up at the state Voter Information Center at https://cdcbp.ky.gov/VICWeb/index.jsp.

• Know where you vote. Some polling locations have changed. You can find the address and driving directions through the state VIC.

• Know the most convenient times to vote. Polls are open 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Polls tend to be busiest during the morning and evening rush hours and at lunchtime.

• Bring some identification to your polling location. You must either be known by a precinct officer or produce a driver's license, social security card, credit card or other form of identification that contains a picture and signature before you may cast a ballot.

• Ask a poll worker for instructions on how to use the voting machine or other procedural questions if you are confused about the process.

• Let officials know immediately if you encounter problems at the polls. You may talk to precinct election officers, the county clerk, the State Board of Elections at (502) 573-7100, or the Attorney General's Election Fraud Hotline at 1-800-328-VOTE.

• Remind your friends and family to vote. Everyone's voice deserves to be heard at the polls.

Don't list

• Don't wait until the last minute to head to the polls or be discouraged by long lines. As long as you are in line by 6 p.m. on election day, you will be allowed to cast your ballot.

• Don't campaign or solicit votes within 300 feet of a polling place. It's illegal in Kentucky. That includes placing campaign signs or handing out literature.

• Don't record the identity of voters in the voting room. That includes using cameras and cell phones.

• Don't forget to thank your poll workers. The election would not be possible without them.
