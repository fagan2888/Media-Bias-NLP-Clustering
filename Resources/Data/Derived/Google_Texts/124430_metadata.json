In 2007, Sessions was widely credited with blocking then-President George W. Bush\u2019s effort to provide legal status and a pathway to citizenship for roughly 12 million illegal immigrants. The Alabama senator\u2019s outspoken position on illegal immigration has continued during the Obama administration. He now chairs the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and The National Interest, a perch from which he has worked to stem the flow of immigration, which he believes is suppressing Americans\u2019 wages and damaging the middle class.\n\n2. \u201cA dedicated effort to reduce crime and prosecute armed career criminals and drug dealers\u201d\n\nAlthough Sessions\u2019 immigration push has garnered the most headlines, he has also been a leading advocate for law enforcement. Last year he partnered with Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) to introduce the Thin Blue Line Act, which would enforce harsher penalties on individuals targeting police officers and first responders.\n\n3. \u201cCanceling the sovereignty-eroding 2 million-word Trans-Pacific Partnership, and rebuilding our manufacturing core\u201d\n\nDuring his State of the Union Address on Tuesday, President Obama said the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would \u201copen markets, protect workers and the environment, and advance American leadership in Asia.\u201d Sessions has said repeatedly that TPP is just another multi-national trade agreement in which \u201cbig business\u201d gets what it wants while American workers get the short end of the stick.\n\n4. \u201cWelfare-to-work: celebrating the dignity of work, and helping our own people move from welfare to good-paying jobs\u201d\n\nDuring a Senate Budget Committee hearing last year, Sessions said the federal and state governments spend a combined $1 trillion each year on means-tested welfare programs, with only 1 percent of that spending going toward job training programs.\n\n\u201cImagine if we reprogrammed more of those funds for job placement and apprenticeship programs,\u201d he said. \u201cThis would help transition millions from dependence to independence\u2014without denying benefits to a single person in need. Our goal is simple: whenever possible, help someone to find a good-paying job that can support a family.\u201d\n\n5. \u201cAdoption and implementation of a balanced budget plan\u201d\n\nSessions has called the United States\u2019 nearly $19 trillion debt \u201ca national calamity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were told this dangerous taxing and borrowing would spur economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cBut growth over the previous 4 years has averaged only 2.2%, about half of what the White House projected\u2026 Never has so great a sum been spent for so little.\u201d\n\n6. \u201cRepeal of ObamaCare\u201d\n\nCongress finally sent a bill fully repealing ObamaCare to the President\u2019s desk last week. He promptly vetoed it. Assuming Republican maintain control of both chambers of Congress, the outcome could be different with a Republican in the White House.\n\n7. \u201cCreating a smaller, leaner and less costly bureaucracy\u201d\n\nThe Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2011 laid out \u201c34 areas where programs have overlapping objectives or provide similar services\u201d and \u201c47 other areas where Congress could take steps to improve the efficiency of federal programs and agencies,\u201d according to CNN.\n\nThe GAO report estimated \u201csavings and revenues could result in tens of billions of dollars in annual savings, depending on the extent of actions taken.\u201d\n\n8. \u201cStreamlining the tax code, making it easier to keep jobs and wealth in America\u201d\n\nWholesale tax reform remains a dream for conservatives, but it does not look like it will have a shot unless a Republican wins the White House.\n\n\u201cGetting it done in 2016, that\u2019s not going to happen because Barack Obama is president,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\n9. \u201cTapping into our vast energy resources\u201d\n\nAfter Congress refused to pass Cap and Trade, President Obama chose to implement his liberal environmental agenda through the executive branch, particularly the EPA. The results have been crushing to American energy companies, particularly those in the coal industry.\n\n\u201cMedian income is down in America per family by $2,300. Your wages are down, your job prospects are down, unemployment remains exceedingly high, and we are now going to add in effect another tax, a regulatory tax on the price of energy so a person\u2019s electric bill and their gas bill is going to go up?\u201d an exasperated Sessions asked in 2014. \u201cThat\u2019s the inevitable result of [the newly announced EPA regulations].\u201d\n\n10. \u201cRestoration of the constitutional rule of law.\u201d\n\nEnough said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senator Jeff Sessions lays out ten things the next President of the United States must do to help working Americans.", "og": {"site_name": "Yellowhammer News", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Jeff Sessions joined many of his Republican colleagues in blasting President Barack Obama\u2019s final State of the Union Address, saying the President\u2019s \u201cpolicy agenda on trade, crime,[...]", "title": "Jeff Sessions' Top 10 things the next President must do to help working Americans - Yellowhammer News", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 820, "identifier": "http://yellowhammernews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Jeff-Sessions-1.jpg", "height": 429}, "updated_time": "2016-01-13T22:50:37-05:00", "url": "http://yellowhammernews.com/politics-2/jeff-sessions-top-10-things-the-next-president-must-do-to-help-working-americans/", "type": "article"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "1bb21e647809aaf739789565c0783008"}, "fb": {"pages": 303363616352436}, "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "welfare-to-work", "published_time": "2016-01-12T23:21:43-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-13T22:50:37-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cTapping into our vast energy resources\u201dAfter Congress refused to pass Cap and Trade, President Obama chose to implement his liberal environmental agenda through the executive branch, particularly the EPA.\n\u201cA dedicated effort to reduce crime and prosecute armed career criminals and drug dealers\u201dAlthough Sessions\u2019 immigration push has garnered the most headlines, he has also been a leading advocate for law enforcement.\n\u201cGetting it done in 2016, that\u2019s not going to happen because Barack Obama is president,\u201d said House Speaker Paul Ryan.\n\u201cImmigration control and reduction\u201dThis one will come as no surprise to anyone who has followed Sessions\u2019 rise as the GOP\u2019s top immigration hawk.\nAssuming Republican maintain control of both chambers of Congress, the outcome could be different with a Republican in the White House."}
