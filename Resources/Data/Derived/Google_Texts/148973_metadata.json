He called them a JV team, he said that they weren\u2019t really serious or important. He has not in any sense addressed their threat. And he is a bad joke, as the leader of the most important nation in the world, he\u2019s a bad joke.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cHe\u2019s a very real danger. Well, I\u2019m very interested in psychology I\u2019m very interest in psychoanalysis. I guess I probably should have been a psychologist. I think the question is, why is he so angry at America? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much question that he does not wish America well. He has a real strong hatred of America. Is it because he\u2019s part black? I don\u2019t know. Is it because he felt his father was mistreated by the British in Kenya? I don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know. We just know that in terms of being a forthright, bold leader who takes on our enemies, he\u2019s not there. He\u2019s missing in action.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN\n\n12", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ben Stein: Obama 'Has a Real Strong Hatred of America'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Ben Stein: Obama 'Has a Real Strong Hatred of America'", "title": "Ben Stein: Obama 'Has a Real Strong Hatred of America' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Stein-519-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "updated_time": "2015-11-17T15:50:27-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/11/17/ben-stein-obama-has-a-real-strong-hatred-of-america/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ben Stein: Obama 'Has a Real Strong Hatred of America'", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/Stein-519-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "Ben Stein: Obama 'Has a Real Strong Hatred of America' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Ben Stein, President Obama,Breitbart TV, Obama,Ben Stein", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-11-17T15:40:32-07:00", "section": "Breitbart TV", "modified_time": "2015-11-17T15:50:27-07:00", "tag": "President Obama", "categories": "Breitbart TV,Obama"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "He has a real strong hatred of America.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERTuesday on Newsmax TV\u2019s \u201cThe Steve Malzberg Show,\u201d Ben Stein, a former speechwriter for Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, actor and author, Ben Stein said President Barack Obama \u201chas a real strong hatred of America.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERStein said, \u201cMr.\nWe don\u2019t know.\nI don\u2019t know.\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much question that he does not wish America well."}
