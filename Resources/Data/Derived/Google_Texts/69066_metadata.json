But the freelance life isn\u2019t all monthlong vacations and days spent shooting off emails in your sweats and slippers. Going the self-employed route takes work\u2014especially in the beginning, when you\u2019re building up your network of contacts and ensuring that you have a steady stream of income coming in to reach your financial goals.\n\nSo how can you set yourself up for success from the get-go? We asked those who\u2019d know best: freelancers who\u2019ve had great success working for themselves\u2014like a business pro who now consults for Fortune 500 companies around the world.\n\nTip #1: Have a Financial Plan from Day 1\n\nWorking for yourself can be a tough adjustment if you\u2019re used to getting steady guidance and support from managers and coworkers. Bottom line: At the end of the day, whether you sink or swim as a freelancer is entirely up to you.\n\n\u201cThere is no \u2018safety net\u2019 when you\u2019re a freelancer\u2014no infrastructure,\u201d says Teri Aulph, a Tulsa-based author and business consultant for Fortune 500 companies. \u201cSo you have to be honest about your financial reality: What are your margins? Cost structures? Are you looking at your return on investment? It can be overwhelming, but having a plan is critical.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Freelancers Won't Be Able to Retire\n\nSo before venturing out on your own, sit down with a clear understanding of your finances and then draft a business plan (consult the Small Business Association for tips on how to create one). As with any major money project, you\u2019ll want to establish goals and a strategy for meeting them\u2014whether that\u2019s acquiring a dozen new clients by year\u2019s end, becoming profitable in the next six months or doubling your rates.\n\nTip #2: Spend Wisely\n\nEven if you leave a profitable job to freelance, you\u2019ll have a limited amount of capital at your disposal until you start to accrue clients. So what should you spend on first to get your business off the ground? Consider the advice of Aulph: \u201cTalk the part before you look the part.\u201d\n\nTranslation: Your upfront expenses should be allocated toward getting clients, not satisfying a superficial checklist of what you think that an entrepreneur should have. \u201cBusiness cards, yes,\u201d says Aulph, \u201cnice office furniture, no.\u201d Once you have steady income streams in place to cover your necessary expenses, then you can start browsing Pottery Barn.\n\nTip #3: Cast a Wide Contacts Net\n\nClients don\u2019t always come to you\u2014in the beginning, especially, you have to go to them. And the more people you know, the better your chances are of coming across potential business opportunities.\n\nYou can start with the obvious: social media. \u201cIndustry groups on Facebook and LinkedIn are priceless in terms of boosting morale, answering questions and networking,\u201d notes Linsey Knerl, a Nebraska-based freelance writer and social media manager specializing in small business and financial service start-ups. \u201cPlus, freelancers who are social-media-savvy tend to share opportunities freely\u2014without fear of competition.\u201d\n\nRelated: Freelancers - Get Ready for IRS Audit\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just social media platforms that can help get your name out there: The Small Business Association provides local resources for small business owners, and you can also look into in-person industry events and gatherings through sites like Meetup.com and even Craigslist.\n\nTip #4: Put the Right Price on Your Time\n\nThe saying \u201ctime is money\u201d has never been so true as it is for a freelancer. \u201cOnce you become your own boss, it can be hard to make yourself sit down and get all the work done on time when you can easily say, \u2018I don\u2019t really feel like working today,\u2019 \u201d admits Owen Hunt, a contract multimedia artist in Orange County, Calif.\n\nThis newfound flexibility means that you have to make your time on the clock worth your while, especially when you\u2019re juggling multiple clients. \u201cGood freelancers must always be on their toes, so they don\u2019t underbid themselves on jobs,\u201d says Hunt. \u201cBecause you\u2019re working with different clients, every new project is a new beginning, almost like your first day at work.\u201d\n\nAs part of your business plan, you should have an idea of what you\u2019ll charge, based on the going rate for your services (the Small Business Association has helpful guidelines). And then it\u2019s time to ask yourself a hard question: Is a project worth your time? As Tom Finnegan, a freelance copyeditor in San Francisco, confesses, \u201cOne of the biggest challenges I\u2019ve faced as a freelancer is saying thanks-but-no-thanks to offers of work that won\u2019t pay well!\u201d\n\nTip # 5: Learn to Delegate\n\nWhen you don\u2019t have an IT department, accounting team or an administrative assistant, all of the above falls to you. Rather than waste time struggling with projects outside of your expertise\u2014like tackling your complicated tax return or trying to build your own website\u2014consider creating your own team of helpers.\n\nRelated: Permalancing - The New Disposable Workforce\n\n\u201cI handle my own finances, but I have a CPA who takes care of my taxes and a financial planner who takes care of retirement,\u201d says Dr. Drumm McNaughton, a mastery-level management consultant based out of Fallbrook, Calif. \u201cThere is only so much time in the day, and I \u2018outsource\u2019 those things that are \u2018cost centers.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSo do a few calculations: Is all that time spent on frustrating non-revenue-producing tasks costing you more than it would to outsource? If so, you may want to look into hiring someone to take them over \u2026 perhaps another freelancer!\n\nTip #6: Make Sure Your Name Is Top of Mind\n\nNot every client is going to be a perfect match right away, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you shouldn\u2019t follow up with them down the road. \u201cWith every potential client,\u201d notes Aulph, \u201cyou can plant a seed for what you can offer in the future. When they are ready for that next step, they will come to you.\u201d\n\nAnd remember: Your name is your business, so don\u2019t let it fade away. Nervous about sending a note to a long-ago client? One way to get back in touch is to create a system for checking in, whether that means sending holiday greetings or putting together a biannual newsletter update.\n\n\u201cOn my freelance editing website, I have two features that I regularly update,\u201d says Finnegan. \u201cEvery new posting is announced in an email to the editors in my address book using humor\u2014and virtually every time that such a message goes out, a job comes in.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019ve established yourself, even modestly, with a portfolio of good work and a network of contacts for potential referrals,\u201d adds Finnegan, \u201cfreelancing should deliver on its promise of steady word-of-mouth\u2014and more work than you expect.\u201d\n\nThis story originally appeared at Learnvest.com.
