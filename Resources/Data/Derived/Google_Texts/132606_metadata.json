John Kasich of Ohio has going for him in his long-shot bid for the GOP presidential nomination is his status as a serious student of government, with years of practical experience under his belt as chair of the House Budget Committee during the \u201cRepublican Revolution\u201d of the late 1990s.\n\nDuring the Clinton administration, Kasich drew kudos for his role as a leading architect of the bipartisan Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which led to the first budget surpluses since the 1960s. Kasich and other Republican leaders championed a tough, politically risky strategy that combined tax cuts with sharp reductions in defense, Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlement programs.\n\nRelated: 10 Things You Need to Know About John Kasich\n\nKasich was bent on dramatic changes in the way the federal government operated and did business, but within the framework of the existing federal system.\n\nFast forward to Thursday, when Kasich \u2013 struggling to keep his presidential hopes alive \u2013 unveiled a new blueprint for wiping out the current budget deficit: The sharp tax cuts are still there but now Kasich is declaring the federal government hopelessly \u201cobsolete\u201d and calling for a major shift in power and resources to the states.\n\nWhile Republican and Democratic lawmakers, business and labor leaders, and a majority of governors and state officials are clamoring for passage of major new highway and mass transit construction legislation, Kasich proposes dismantling the federal Department of Transportation and returning federal gas tax revenues to the states.\n\n\u201cThe interstate system is long finished, and states already oversee their own highway design and construction,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed piece in The Washington Post. \u201cAmericans don\u2019t need a costly federal highway bureaucracy,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI will return the federal gas taxes to the states, leaving only a sliver with the federal government for truly national needs.\u201d\n\nRelated: Does Kasich Have a Chance? How He Can Catch Up to the GOP 15\n\nThe proposal overlooks the fact that the 14.3-cents per gallon federal gas tax is woefully inadequate in meeting existing federal highway program costs and that the Highway Trust Fund provides only about a quarter of all transit and highway financing nationwide. Slicing and dicing already inadequate funding and turning it back to the states based on some ill-defined formula doesn\u2019t sound like a recipe for success.\n\nKasich is also proposing some other Republican chestnuts for downsizing the federal government \u2013 including all but closing the Department of Education, eliminating dozens of job training programs and giving more responsibility for Medicaid to the states. \u201cThere may have been a time when our nation\u2019s size and complexity required a strong, centralized government, but today\u2019s technology gives states access to the same ideas and capabilities as Washington \u2013 and they can execute faster and more efficiently.\u201d\n\nWho knew that Kasich, long viewed as a steely-eyed, moderate pragmatist, was actually a radical in disguise. Or perhaps, like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker before him, Kasich believes he must somehow convince increasingly skeptical voters that he is a true \u201coutsider\u201d determined to bring the federal bureaucracy to its knees in order to salvage a struggling presidential campaign.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "One of the things Gov.", "title": "Moderate John Kasich Has a Radical Plan for Highway Spending", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/16/Moderate-John-Kasich-Has-Radical-Plan-Highway-Spending", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06232015_John_Kasich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/10/16/Moderate-John-Kasich-Has-Radical-Plan-Highway-Spending", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06232015_John_Kasich.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "One of the things Gov.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2226\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAmericans don\u2019t need a costly federal highway bureaucracy,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cI will return the federal gas taxes to the states, leaving only a sliver with the federal government for truly national needs.\u201dRelated: Does Kasich Have a Chance?\nHow He Can Catch Up to the GOP 15The proposal overlooks the fact that the 14.3-cents per gallon federal gas tax is woefully inadequate in meeting existing federal highway program costs and that the Highway Trust Fund provides only about a quarter of all transit and highway financing nationwide.\nKasich and other Republican leaders championed a tough, politically risky strategy that combined tax cuts with sharp reductions in defense, Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlement programs.\n\u201cThe interstate system is long finished, and states already oversee their own highway design and construction,\u201d he wrote in an op-ed piece in The Washington Post."}
