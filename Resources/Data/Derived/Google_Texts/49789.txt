Seattle police have arrested U.S. soccer star Hope Solo for allegedly assaulting her sister and 17-year-old nephew in a Seattle home. She was booked into a detention facility and will be required to appear in court June 23rd.

According to Lt. Mike Murray, officers responded to an assault and noise disturbance report. “There was a big party going on at her house. It was an out-of-control situation,” Murray told the Seattle Times. The police believe that Solo, who was “intoxicated and upset,” according to the police report, instigated a physical assault. “There were visible injuries” on Solo’s sister and nephew, Murray said.
