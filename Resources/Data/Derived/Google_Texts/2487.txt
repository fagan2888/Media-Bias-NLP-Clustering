Obamacare Limiting Prescription Drug Coverage

We already know that under Obamacare you can’t necessarily keep your insurance plan or doctor, even if you like them. It turns out that you also might not be able to keep using the prescription drugs you’ve been taking for years. And you may not be able to use a drug a doctor prescribes you for simple illnesses, too.

Dr. Donna Barsky of Texas Star Pharmacy told KTRH she saw it happen to a woman that was given an antibiotic for an infection.

“They rejected her because she was seventy years old and she was given a minor antibiotic for a local infection,” Barsky told KTRH.

Barsky says that unfortunately it’s not the first time she has seen this. And it won’t be the last.

“We’re starting to see more of it, including with drugs that patients have been taking for decades,” Barsky explained.

An even scarier prospect for patients is that the list of drugs that are covered change constantly.

“A drug that is covered today might not be covered next week,” Barsky stated.

And if you’re taking drugs for a more serious illness it could become very costly if the drugs aren’t covered under Obamacare.

“We’re talking several thousand dollars a year. Sometimes even in the tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the medication they are using,” Barsky said.

“We had one family come in and their co pay for generic drugs went from $10 to $30. For a trade name drug it went from $30 to $60,” Barsky explained.

And this veteran pharmacist says you are simply fed up.

“They get very frustrated. They’re diagnosed with something, given a prescription and the insurance company won’t pay for it. We’re back at ground zero,” Barsky said.
