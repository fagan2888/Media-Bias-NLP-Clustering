According to this logic, minimum wage workers aren\u2019t worth more than the $7.25 an hour they now receive. If they were worth more, they\u2019d earn more. Any attempt to force employers to pay them more will only kill jobs.\n\nAccording to this same logic, CEOs of big companies are worth their giant compensation packages, now averaging 300 times pay of the typical American worker. They must be worth it or they wouldn\u2019t be paid this much. Any attempt to limit their pay is fruitless because their pay will only take some other form.\n\n\u201cPaid-what-you\u2019re-worth\u201d is a dangerous myth.\n\nFifty years ago, when General Motors was the largest employer in America, the typical GM worker got paid $35 an hour in today\u2019s dollars. Today, America\u2019s largest employer is Walmart, and the typical Walmart workers earns $8.80 an hour.\n\nDoes this mean the typical GM employee a half-century ago was worth four times what today\u2019s typical Walmart employee is worth? Not at all. Yes, that GM worker helped produce cars rather than retail sales. But he wasn\u2019t much better educated or even that much more productive. He often hadn\u2019t graduated from high school. And he worked on a slow-moving assembly line. Today\u2019s Walmart worker is surrounded by digital gadgets \u2014 mobile inventory controls, instant checkout devices, retail search engines \u2014 making him or her quite productive.\n\nThe real difference is the GM worker a half-century ago had a strong union behind him that summoned the collective bargaining power of all autoworkers to get a substantial share of company revenues for its members. And because more than a third of workers across America belonged to a labor union, the bargains those unions struck with employers raised the wages and benefits of non-unionized workers as well. Non-union firms knew they\u2019d be unionized if they didn\u2019t come close to matching the union contracts.\n\nToday\u2019s Walmart workers don\u2019t have a union to negotiate a better deal. They\u2019re on their own. And because fewer than 7 percent of today\u2019s private-sector workers are unionized, non-union employers across America don\u2019t have to match union contracts. This puts unionized firms at a competitive disadvantage. The result has been a race to the bottom.\n\nBy the same token, today\u2019s CEOs don\u2019t rake in 300 times the pay of average workers because they\u2019re \u201cworth\u201d it. They get these humongous pay packages because they appoint the compensation committees on their boards that decide executive pay. Or their boards don\u2019t want to be seen by investors as having hired a \u201csecond-string\u201d CEO who\u2019s paid less than the CEOs of their major competitors. Either way, the result has been a race to the top.\n\nIf you still believe people are paid what they\u2019re worth, take a look at Wall Street bonuses. Last year\u2019s average bonus was up 15 percent over the year before, to more than $164,000. It was the largest average Wall Street bonus since the 2008 financial crisis and the third highest on record, according to New York\u2019s state comptroller. Remember, we\u2019re talking bonuses, above and beyond salaries.\n\nAll told, the Street paid out a whopping $26.7 billion in bonuses last year.\n\nAre Wall Street bankers really worth it? Not if you figure in the hidden subsidy flowing to the big Wall Street banks that ever since the bailout of 2008 have been considered too big to fail.\n\nPeople who park their savings in these banks accept a lower interest rate on deposits or loans than they require from America\u2019s smaller banks. That\u2019s because smaller banks are riskier places to park money. Unlike the big banks, the smaller ones won\u2019t be bailed out if they get into trouble.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The former secretary of labor explains how this line of thinking keeps minimum wages (and the American people) down", "title": "Robert Reich: \u201cPaid-what-you\u2019re-worth\u201d is a toxic myth", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The former secretary of labor explains how this line of thinking keeps minimum wages (and the American people) down", "title": "Robert Reich: \u201cPaid-what-you\u2019re-worth\u201d is a toxic myth", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/15/robert_reich_paid_what_youre_worth_is_a_dangerous_myth_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former secretary of labor explains how this line of thinking keeps minimum wages (and the American people) down", "title": "Robert Reich: \u201cPaid-what-you\u2019re-worth\u201d is a toxic myth", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/01/robert_reich.jpg", "creator": "@rbreich", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Robert Reich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, General Motors, Minimum wage, Paid-What-You're Worth, RobertReich.org, Wal-Mart, Wall Street", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Today, America\u2019s largest employer is Walmart, and the typical Walmart workers earns $8.80 an hour.\nDoes this mean the typical GM employee a half-century ago was worth four times what today\u2019s typical Walmart employee is worth?\nToday\u2019s Walmart worker is surrounded by digital gadgets \u2014 mobile inventory controls, instant checkout devices, retail search engines \u2014 making him or her quite productive.\nTopics: General Motors, Minimum wage, Paid-What-You're Worth, RobertReich.org, Wal-Mart, Wall Street, Business News, Politics NewsThis originally appeared on Robert Reich's blogIt\u2019s often assumed that people are paid what they\u2019re worth.\nAll told, the Street paid out a whopping $26.7 billion in bonuses last year."}
