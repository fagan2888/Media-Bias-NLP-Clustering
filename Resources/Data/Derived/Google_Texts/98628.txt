SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — His swings, shouts and sliding catch all done, Hunter Pence shuttled from one postgame TV interview to another outside the San Francisco dugout, bumping through a crush of people with every step.

At last, he wound up standing smack in the center of a giant World Series logo. A fitting spot, for sure.

With eyes wide open and tongue hanging out, the quirky player who seems to be a perfect fit for a quirky ballpark rallied his team and their fans, sending the Giants past the Kansas City Royals 11-4 Saturday to even the Series at two games apiece.

“I mean, he’s the guy that’s a vocal leader on the team, and he gets guys fired up,” rookie second baseman Joe Panik said.

“And with his play, he’s all-out and gives everything he’s got. It’s spectacular to watch. He’s fun to watch. He’s really big to this team. He’s in the middle of a lot of things, offensively and defensively,” he said.

All part of Pence’s approach.
