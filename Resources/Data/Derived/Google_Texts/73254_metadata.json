Mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and other types of partnerships are viewed as key strategies for healthcare entities to, \u201cenhance competencies and scale to provide coordinated, cost-effective care across the continuum,\u201d according to a recent Kaufman, Hall & Associates report.\n\nHealthcare M&A reached $241 billion in the first five months of 2015.\n\nauto image + link\n\nThe numbers are impressive. In 2015 alone, there were 112 hospital transactions, up 18% from 2014. Healthcare M&A activity reached $241 billion in the first five months of 2015, a year-to-date record, Dr. Kaveh Safavi, senior managing director for Accenture\u2019s global healthcare business told Healthcare Dive. \u201cThis is fundamentally reshaping the U.S. healthcare landscape and will have impacts over the next year as well. Looking to the future, it will be important for healthcare providers to be strategic with their growth opportunities.\u201d\n\nSafavi explained such opportunities include:\n\nHorizontal M&A (hospitals buying other hospitals);\n\nVertical M&A (hospital acquiring a payer); and\n\nCapturing the benefit of rapidly emerging digital health technology.\n\nAccording to an article written by Paul Keckley, a health economist and leading expert on U.S. health reform, only 30% of the 5,200 U.S. hospitals remain independent.\n\nHospitals and physician groups are not the only healthcare organizations making deals \u2013 a PwC report found by mid-year 2015 healthcare deals broke 2014 records with $400 billion in announced agreements. The recently announced Abbott and St. Jude Medical deal towers at $25 billion and creates one of the largest cardiovascular device companies worldwide.\n\nWhile all this has been happening, the pending insurance mega-mergers, Aetna/Humana and Anthem/Cigna still remain under federal scrutiny. A final decision isn\u2019t expected until later this year\n\nWhat\u2019s driving consolidation?\n\nMost experts agree costs are a major driving force behind the M&A frenzy. \u201cYou have health systems trying to lower costs under pressure from players from the contracting front,\u201d Stephen Moore, a healthcare M&A partner at PwC, told Healthcare Dive. \u201cTheir contractor rates with payers are not keeping pace with cost increases so you\u2019re seeing the need to spread what appears to be a resilient fixed cost base over a larger population or system that\u2019s driving a need for scale. We see that trend continuing over the next few years with the exchange plans. Costs are driving up those rates and commercial rates are increasing as well.\u201d\n\n\"Larger organizations have the ability to reduce risk by spreading it across more players.\"\n\nauto image + link\n\nMichael Dowling, president and CEO at Northwell Health (formerly North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System), told the Wall Street Journal, \u201cEverybody is getting larger. The big providers are going to compete on quality and service and price.\u201d Northwell recently expanded into Brooklyn via a merger with Maimonides Medical Center. Dowling explained that size matters when it comes to negotiating with insurers. \u201cYou want to be able to sit across the table and be in a position to negotiate. You don\u2019t just want to be told what they are going to pay you.\u201d\n\nRisk also plays a big role in partnerships. \u201cAll stakeholders in healthcare are taking on additional risk,\u201d Laurie Ringlein, practice director at T2C, a healthcare consulting group, told Healthcare Dive. Larger organizations have the ability to reduce risk by spreading it across more players, Ringlein explained. \u201cPayment is more closely linked to clinical outcomes \u2013 value-based reimbursement. The shift away from fee-for-service means there\u2019s more clinical and quality risk because now they get paid for the outcome of a procedure.\" This has led many organizations to consider entering into an accountable care organization (ACO) arrangement.\n\nConsumers are playing a bigger role in healthcare decisions. Ringlein explained since they pay more out-of-pocket for care, \u201cit will drive different choices of which providers they see and what procedures they get.\u201d In addition, more focus on the consumer experience, she added, \u201cdictates a need for additional data sharing and being able to prove you\u2019re having an impact on higher risk patients. Larger systems are much more powerful negotiators so they can negotiate better deals with suppliers like medical device companies.\u201d\n\nSafavi said digital M&A holds the greatest opportunity for growth this year. \u201cDigital health holds the promise to reinvent healthcare, which can both transform and disrupt business models. We anticipate digital health acquisitions will expand by a multiple of 8 \u2013 from 1% of overall acquisition volume in 2014 to 8% by 2018.\u201d\n\nDifferent types of partnerships\n\nDo hospitals need to diversify their portfolio?\n\nauto image + link\n\nHospitals are diversifying their partnerships and acquisitions, which in fact, Moore said is a growing trend. \u201cI think they\u2019re reaching out in multiple directions,\u201d Moore said. \u201cOne trend we see is many more partnerships between payers and providers \u2013 either hospitals are thinking about their own provider-sponsored health plan, or starting one.\u201d One example Moore provided is the recent Anthem deal with Aurora Health creating a health insurance company \u2013 Wisconsin Collaborative.\n\n\u201cI see other payers thinking the same way \u2013 we have to integrate with the provider and work together if we\u2019re going to hold down medical costs trends,\u201d Moore said. These types of partnerships require a broader coverage of all medical costs \u201cfrom end-to-end\u201d since \u201ca lot of investment and interest is in all the post-acute care: Outpatient surgery, home health, home care, etc,\u201d Moore explained.\n\nMore scrutiny from regulators?\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has challenged some recent hospital mergers like the pending Chicago-based Advocate Health Care and NorthShore Univeristy Health System deal, which, if approved would create the 11th largest nonprofit hospital system in the U.S., according to Modern Healthcare. Last month, both companies presented their case to a federal judge who will decide whether the merger moves forward. Moore said the agency is paying special attention to mergers where there is market share. \u201cThey clearly don\u2019t buy the argument that even though the healthcare system has to become more efficient, that it has to come at the expense of something that has the appearance of being anti-competitive.\u201d\n\nJoint ventures and strategic partnerships might garner less scrutiny by the FTC.\n\nauto image + link\n\nHowever, Ringlein hinted that the move towards more joint ventures and strategic partnerships might garner less scrutiny by the FTC. \u201cThese partnerships tend to fly under the radar of that scrutiny.\u201d Another benefit, according to Ringlein, is those types of agreements, \u201care easier to get out of if benefits aren\u2019t realized within the timeframe they\u2019re expecting them to. I think we\u2019re going to start seeing more strategic-type partnership alignment and fewer formalized changes of ownership.\u201d\n\nMoving forward\n\nBoth Moore and Ringlein foresee healthcare partnership activity remaining active throughout the year. Moore said partnering and joint ventures will increase between providers with more state-wide and regional networks in the non-profit space. \u201cA lot of state-based organizations are very aggressive now in the market and growing their footprint nationally.\u201d\n\nRinglein said she expects fewer transactions among payers but expects provider partnerships to increase because \u201cthere is a lot of pressure on providers to reduce costs, provide more coordinated care, and expand their networks so they are performing team-based coordinated care and data sharing.\u201d She also expects larger hospital systems \u201cto start carving out chunks of their ownership of hospitals in non-profitable markets or markets that are difficult to serve.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s little doubt healthcare consolidation will continue as demand increases and the population ages. However, it remains to be seen whether the potential cost savings trickles down to consumers.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Nina Flanagan", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "True", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/6c/8d/6c8d819ed06dd27260a8012ab0777c05.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-finance,healthcare-hospital-admin", "news_keywords": "Finance,Hospital Administration,Hospital Admin", "category": "News Post", "sailthru.item_featured": 1, "title": "Merge ahead: Healthcare deals adapting as industry evolves", "pub_date": "may 13, 2016", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2016-05-13T15:17:35", "content_boost": 5, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Friday, May 13, 2016, 03:17 PM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2026-05-01T15:17:35", "teaser": "<p>Healthcare consolidations hit record levels in 2015.
