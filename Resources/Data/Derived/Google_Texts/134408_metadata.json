(Catholic doctrine bans the use of birth control, and, contrary to scientific evidence, several of the groups claim that the contraceptives covered under the Affordable Care Act cause abortions.) But the groups claim that filling out the form made them complicit in providing contraception, since it sets in motion a process in which the government provides the coverage.\n\nThe government argues that it is not the form which \u201ctriggers\u201d the coverage, but the Affordable Care Act. A refusal to provide contraceptive coverage or fill out the form results in steep fines.\n\nThe groups sued under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, meaning the case presented an opportunity to significantly broaden or circumscribe the protections established by that 1993 act of Congress. Before coming before the supreme court in March, the two sides cast the trial as a high-stakes battle for women\u2019s equality or the fundamental right to religious freedom.\n\nThe justices\u2019 questions at oral arguments certainly reflected that clash. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito both posed questions implying that relying on the not-for-profit organizations\u2019 healthcare provider in any way to guarantee contraceptive coverage constituted government \u201chijacking\u201d.\n\nBut the justices sometimes seemed wary of deciding the case, which was actually several lower court cases combined, with the same sweeping effect as it has in other challenges to the Affordable Care Act. They asked questions that dwelled on the vagaries of the insurance market. Several days after arguments, the court made the unusual move of calling for additional briefs from both sides, in a signal that the majority opinion might strike a compromise.\n\nNow, it seems as though the justices were brokering a peace.\n\nMonday\u2019s order instructs the lower courts to rule based on the new arguments and information presented in those briefs. The two sides, the court said, had agreed in their briefs that an acceptable compromise would be for religious employers to contract with their insurance provider for a coverage plan that excludes contraceptives, and for the same insurance company to simply provide the excluded contraceptio\n\nUntil those new rulings come down, the government may continue acting on the forms it receives from not-for-profit organizations to cover contraception for the nonprofits\u2019 employees. The ruling also stayed any fines the nonprofits faced for failing to comply.\n\n\u201cThe Court expresses no view on the merits of the cases,\u201d Monday\u2019s decision reads. \u201cIn particular, the Court does not decide whether petitioners\u2019 religious exercise has been substantially burdened, whether the Government has a compelling interest\u201d to ensure contraceptive coverage, \u201cor whether the current regulations are the least restrictive means of serving that interest\u201d.\n\n\n\nA concurrence by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg stressed that lower courts were still free to rule that the government\u2019s approach did not impinge on religious practice, as many appeals courts have.\n\nThe court\u2019s approach was an unusual one, and many of the the immediate reactions reflected a state of uncertainty.\n\n\u201cWhile we are disappointed that the court did not resolve once and for all whether the religious beliefs of religiously affiliated non-profit employers can block women\u2019s seamless access to birth control, we are confident in the final outcome,\u201d Gretchen Borchelt, a vice-president with the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said in a call with reporters. She said the order cleared the way for the government to provide seamless health coverage to the \u201ctens of thousands of women\u201d employees and students of non-profit religious hospitals and charities, colleges.\n\nA spokesperson for Planned Parenthood said the decision will \u201cmaintain long-term uncertainty for women who work at nonprofit organizations about whether the accommodation will enable them to access to birth control with no copay\u201d.\n\nThe nonprofits claimed a partial victory.\n\n\u201cWe are very encouraged by the Court\u2019s decision,\u201d said Mark Rienzi, an attorney at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty who represented one of the not-for-profit groups, the Little Sisters of the Poor, before the court. \u201cToday\u2019s decision indicates that we will ultimately prevail in court.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s outcome is presumed to be the result of the justices\u2019 failure to find a majority. A 4-4 split would have handed liberals a victory, since a tie automatically affirms the appeals court decision under review. Seven appeals courts that have considered the questions in this case have found for the government.\n\nThis is not the first time that Scalia\u2019s empty seat on the court has thrown an element of chance into this year\u2019s term. In late March, a split decision handed a major victory to liberals in a challenge to public sector unions\u2019 ability to collect dues. The case, argued while Scalia was still on the bench, looked poised to deal a deadly blow to public unions if the conservative justices mustered a majority.\n\nOn Monday, Sotomayor\u2019s concurring opinion stressed the narrow nature of the court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s opinion does only what it says it does: \u2018affords an opportunity\u2019 for the parties and courts of appeals to reconsider the parties\u2019 arguments\u201d in light of the new briefs submitted in March. \u201cAs enlightened by the parties\u2019 new submissions, the Courts of Appeals remain free to reach the same conclusion or a different one on each of the questions presented by these cases.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Lauren Gambino", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#005689", "description": "Justices order lower courts to find compromise in case involving faith-based organizations who hold moral objections to Obamacare contraception rules", "application-name": "The Guardian", "author": "Molly Redden", "og": {"site_name": "the Guardian", "description": "Justices order lower courts to find compromise in case involving faith-based organizations who hold moral objections to Obamacare contraception rules", "title": "Supreme court punts on challenge to Obama's contraception mandate", "url": "http://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/16/supreme-court-obamacare-contraception-mandate-zubik-burwell", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3008608c6f6e59e3849fb19d0e0549f49634a950/0_328_3500_2100/3500.jpg?w=1200&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=14b0ef29702606596f75465e37b224e1", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "gnmguardian://law/2016/may/16/supreme-court-obamacare-contraception-mandate-zubik-burwell?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/16/supreme-court-obamacare-contraception-mandate-zubik-burwell", "iphone": "gnmguardian://law/2016/may/16/supreme-court-obamacare-contraception-mandate-zubik-burwell?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}, "id": {"ipad": 409128287, "iphone": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"ipad": "The Guardian", "googleplay": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}}, "site": "@guardian", "image": "https://media.guim.co.uk/3008608c6f6e59e3849fb19d0e0549f49634a950/0_328_3500_2100/3500.jpg", "creator": "@mtredden"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Guardian", "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://law/2016/may/16/supreme-court-obamacare-contraception-mandate-zubik-burwell?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "theme-color": "#005689", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/favicons/f06f6996e193d1ddcd614ea852322d25/windows_tile_144_b.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "US supreme court,US healthcare,Obama administration,Law,US news,Reproductive rights", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "published_time": "2016-05-16T15:51:02.000Z", "author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/molly-redden", "section": "Law", "modified_time": "2016-05-17T00:09:12.000Z", "tag": "US supreme court,US healthcare,Obama administration,Law,US news,Reproductive rights"}, "thumbnail": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3008608c6f6e59e3849fb19d0e0549f49634a950/0_328_3500_2100/3500.jpg?w=620&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=55514e1b5824efa5480c821642a0204b", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "US supreme court,US healthcare,Obama administration,Law,US news,Reproductive rights"}, "article_summary": "A 4-4 split would have handed liberals a victory, since a tie automatically affirms the appeals court decision under review.\nA refusal to provide contraceptive coverage or fill out the form results in steep fines.\nOn Monday, Sotomayor\u2019s concurring opinion stressed the narrow nature of the court\u2019s decision.\nIt was the fourth challenge to Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement to reach the supreme court, and the second challenge to the mandate that employers offer insurance coverage for a wide range of contraceptive pills and devices.\nThe justices\u2019 questions at oral arguments certainly reflected that clash."}
