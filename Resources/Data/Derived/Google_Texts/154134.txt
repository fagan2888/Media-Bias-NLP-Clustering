Pierre, SD

A Menards store planned for Pierre is projecting yearly sales of $30 million to $35 million.



The estimated sales are included in the Tax Increment Financing application documents that the Pierre City Commission has approved. The store is expected to open during the first quarter of 2015.



The TIF would be for 45 acres of city property that includes the Menards property and areas that will be developed in the future.



The documents show that based on the projected sales the store would generate between $600,000 and $700,000 in sales tax per year.



The store plans to hire up to 200 employees. Hourly wages would range between $12 and $20 per hour depending on skills and a benefit package.
