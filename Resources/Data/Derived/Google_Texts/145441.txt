MIAMI (AP) - Miami’s Wynwood arts district is now an official tourist destination. How do we know?

Mayor Tomas Regalado has inaugurated the first visitor stands for the warehouse-turned-gallery neighborhood.

Trained guides will now offer tours of Wynwood’s mural covered walls, as well as information on galleries and other sites. The tours and information will be provided by The Art Experience. The company has provided specialized art and culinary tours in Miami since 2009.

Wynwood has been on the rise over the last decade, drawing many artists who could no longer afford rising rents in Miami Beach and Coconut Grove. It’s central location and urban vibe makes it a hot spot during the winter art festivals such as Art Basel.
