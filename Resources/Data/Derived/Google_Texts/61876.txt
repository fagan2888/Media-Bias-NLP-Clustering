CLEVELAND, Ohio - The number of uninsured Ohioans has dropped by nearly a third since passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, including a sharp decline last year after Ohio began offering expanded coverage under Medicaid, new U.S. Census Bureau estimates say.

Overall, the number of uninsured Ohioans fell from just under 1.4 million in 2010 to 955,205 last year.

That has moved Ohio's uninsured rate from 12.3 percent to 8.4 percent, the Census Bureau estimates, based on its ongoing American Community Survey.

A sizable portion of the decline in uninsured is tied to the expansion of Medicaid for poor people, many of whom work. The number of Ohioans on Medicaid, but with no other insurance, increased by an estimated 200,948 in 2014.

Last year marked the beginning of expanded Medicaid coverage pushed through by Republican Gov. John Kasich, allowing people earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level to receive coverage.

The expanded coverage became available under the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, but many states with Republican leadership declined to participate.

The Kasich administration estimated at the time that up to half the newly qualified people held jobs that didn't provide health plans. The new estimates show more people, both working and not working, are now insured.

The uninsured rate for working Ohioans dropped from 12.4 percent in 2013 to 7.8 percent in 2014, the Census Bureau estimates.

For unemployed people looking for work, the uninsured rate dropped from 37.4 percent to 28.5 percent. And the uninsured rate for people not in the labor force dropped from 9.7 percent to 6.9 percent.

The number of Ohioans with private health insurance also increased, though not as sharply, with an additional 67,000 insured last year over 2013. There were increases for both people receiving health insurance from their employer and among those buying insurance on their own, the estimates said.

Nationally, insurance coverage for people with private plans increased in 36 states, and decreased only in Massachusetts.

The number of people with public health insurance increased in 36 states. There was no statistically significant increase or decrease in the others, the Census Bureau said in announcing the findings. Public health insurance includes Medicaid or Medicare.

Another group that has seen a sharp increase in coverage is young adults. The Affordable Care Act allowed young adults to stay on their parents' coverage through the age of 26, Previously, most lost coverage under their parents plans by the time they graduated from college or moved away from home.

The estimates for 2014 say 147,972 Ohioans ages 18 to 24 were uninsured, down from 268,725 in 2010.
