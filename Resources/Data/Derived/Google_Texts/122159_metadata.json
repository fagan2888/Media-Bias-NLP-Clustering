Proxmire, May 15, 2016)\n\nBloomfield Township, MI \u2013Democrat Charles Gaba is running for County Commissioner for District 12, which includes Bloomfield Hills, Bloomfield Township and Birmingham. He is the only Democrat in the race. Incumbent Shelley Goodman Taube and Chuck Moss, who held the seat before her, are facing off in the Republican primary on Aug. 2. The winner of the primary will be on the ballot against Gaba Nov. 8.\n\nWhen asked about the challenges of running in a traditionally Republican district, Gaba said \u201cIn a heavy Republican area obviously the fact that I\u2019m a Democrat at all is a challenge. People don\u2019t tend to like change. But at the same time I would point out that my opponent, whichever one it turns out to be, the two of them have been county commissioner, one or the other, for I think going on 18 years now. They\u2019ve basically been swapping the job back and forth and I think given the state of what\u2019s happened to the Republican Party nationally I think it might be a good year for some people in the area to take a closer look at what the party\u2019s become, and consider an alternative.\u201d\n\nIn his interview with oc115, Gaba talked about his experience working on a school bond after he opposed an earlier school consolidation plan, his nationally-recognized work tracking Affordable Care Act implementation, and the priorities of fixing the roads, increasing sidewalks and promoting green technologies.\n\nAlso check out our Elections Section or use the search bar at the top to find stories for your community.\n\nAll candidates are invited to do an interview and we are doing our best to connect.
