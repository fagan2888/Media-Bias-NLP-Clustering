Although some experts question whether throwing money at the issue will be enough, many believe that, if used properly, the funding has the potential to save lives.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly half a million Americans died from drug overdoses between 2000 and 2014. Opioid overdose deaths, including those from heroin, hit record highs in 2014 and saw a 14 percent increase in only one year.\n\nBaltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen, who has worked as an emergency room doctor in one of the nation\u2019s opioid addiction hotspots, said the proposal signals a shift in thinking about addiction as an individual\u2019s problem best controlled with law enforcement, to a chronic medical condition like diabetes or heart disease that can be prevented and treated.\n\n\u201cThat science has been around for decades, and society\u2019s perception has caught up,\u201d Wen told FoxNews.com.\n\n\u201cA pill for every pain\u201d\n\nIn 2014, 259 million opioids\u2014 or enough for every American adult\u2014 were prescribed, according to the CDC. The most commonly prescribed opioid pain relievers were natural or semi-synthetic opioids like oxycodone and hydrocodone, which are involved in the most overdose deaths among opioids. The CDC recorded 813 more deaths, a 9 percent increase, from these types of opioids in 2014 than 2013.\n\nOver the last decade, overall deaths resulting from opioid abuse and abuse of illegal narcotics like heroin have quadrupled.\n\nA study published in the November 2015 issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggested overdoses from drugs like opioids is one of the main reasons why deaths of middle-age white Americans are rising while the overall death rate in the United States has fallen.\n\n\u201cThere are people in suburban and rural areas who are dying of overdose,\u201d Wen said. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s taken this level of people dying to get us to where we are, but I do think a sea of change is occurring, and we are seeing how overdose kills.\u201d\n\nAlthough multiple factors have contributed to the epidemic, Wen and other experts have argued that a culture of \u201ca pill for every pain\u201d has played a key role.\n\nDr. Melinda Campopiano, a medical officer at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), who both prescribes opioids and treats patients who have become addicted to them, said when she was in medical school in the \u201990s, professors taught students using the sickest of patients. That approach may have skewed the risk-benefit factor for stronger drugs like opioids versus over-the-counter medication like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen, she said.\n\nAn assumption at the time that pain was undertreated in America overall led many doctors to readily prescribe opioids as it was.\n\nCampopiano added that the trend of overprescribing opioids may also have emerged from a well-intentioned effort to standardize care across the board. At that point, evidence emerged that pain in minorities particularly was being undertreated\u2014a bias that data suggest still affects minority and less-wealthy patients today.\n\n\u201cYou want professionals to overcome their inherent biases, but you can\u2019t count on that, so by being systematic in treating pain, the intention was to eliminate the suffering that was the result of racial and ethnic biases that people had,\u201d Campopiano told FoxNews.com.\n\nThat systematic approach persisted through the 1990s and 2000s, and was accompanied by a push from the federal government for doctors to better address their patients\u2019 pain in its \u201cPain as the Fifth Vital Sign\u201d campaign. Researchers at Brandeis University, New York University and others, argued in the January 2015 edition of The Annual Review of Public Health that Big Pharma\u2019s campaign throughout those decades downplayed the risks of long-term opioid abuse and encouraged their use. In 2007, OxyContin producer Purdue Pharma paid $634.5 million in fines for harmful advertising of the drug.\n\nData shows opioids are among the most addictive drugs on the market. Although experts dispute their efficacy for chronic pain and there\u2019s no perfect pill for every type of pain, the drugs change the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain, generating a euphoric or relaxing effect. But the longer and more frequently an individual takes an opioid, the more they\u2019ll need to take to get the same sense of relief.\n\nDespite increased public knowledge of opioids\u2019 risks, ideals pushed by Big Pharma and the federal government still persist in doctors\u2019 offices. All too often, doctors don\u2019t offer patients alternatives to opioid prescriptions, nor do they always ask about their mental health or addiction history, Campopiano said. Patients want to get better and trust their doctors, so they often don\u2019t challenge their judgment.\n\n\u201cA big downfall in provider education is we don\u2019t teach health professionals to ask about and address mental health and substance use disorder issues consistently and effectively,\u201d Campopiano said. \u201cOn that side of the issue, I would include informed consent of patients so that patients have the opportunity to make fully informed decisions about their treatment options.\u201d\n\nEducating the public about opioid risks\n\nIn May 2015, the CDC urged doctors to prescribe fewer painkillers and encouraged patients to ask questions themselves about alternatives.\n\nAnother question some doctors may not ask is what other drugs patients are taking. One out of every three unintentional deaths involved a harmful combination of opioids and benzodiazepine, a medication that can help relieve everything from muscle spasms to anxiety and sleep problems, Wen said.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already added a boxed warning, the most serious type, to immediate-release opioid painkillers, but it hasn\u2019t yet added warnings to benzodiazepines and opioids to warn doctors and the public of their harmful reactions. Wen and other health officials have petitioned the FDA to do so.\n\nPrescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), which are used in 49 states, can help doctors monitor what their patients have been prescribed, effectively helping prevent patients from experiencing harmful drug reactions or racking up pills.\n\nThe CDC considers them one of the most effective tools for preventing opioid abuse, but states haven\u2019t yet fine-tuned these systems.\n\n\"There isn't yet a single state in the country that has an optimal prescription drug monitoring program that works in real time, actively managing every prescription,\" CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a press conference in March.\n\nBrendan Saloner, assistant professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said states could use the proposed funding to better integrate pre-existing programs like these.\n\n\u201cWhat we have now is not really a system so much as a fragmented network of specialty providers who oftentimes don\u2019t work that well with physical health providers, with human service providers, and with the criminal justice systems\u2014 all of these entities that we know are very closely aligned with these populations,\u201d Saloner told FoxNews.com.\n\nHe added that one of the administration\u2019s most promising propositions for the funding would be to subsidize physician training in areas of need.\n\nIf passed, Obama\u2019s proposal would allocate $920 million to expand their treatment capacity and make services more affordable, $50 million in National Health Service Corps funding to expand access to substance use treatment providers, and $30 million toward researching the efficacy of treatment programs in place and then improving them.\n\nOvercoming stigma\n\nThat opioids are often a bridge to heroin abuse has made the epidemic even more pressing for health officials to address. Eighty percent of people who use heroin started doing so by using prescription pain medication, according to government data. This may happen when a patient can no longer obtain pricier opioids and turns to the street for potentially tainted painkillers or heroin.\n\nCDC data suggests deaths linked with illegal fentanyl, a strong, less expensive opioid commonly added to or disguised as heroin, are increasing.\n\nIn Baltimore, where 527 people died of heroin-related causes in the first nine months of 2015, combatting the epidemic has involved expanding availability of anti-overdose antidotes narcan and naloxone. Wen has issued a blanket prescription to everyone in Baltimore, where residents can take a 10-minute online training course to learn how to administer them.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing is if a patient is given an opioid, they should be given naloxone,\u201d Wen said. \u201cThere should be clearer guidelines about combining the two.\u201d\n\nIn Vermont, officials use a state dashboard to monitor capacity in addiction treatment centers and send alerts when more resources are needed. Saloner said integrating the criminal justice system to help individuals start treatment upon incarceration or to continue treatment after they leave jail could be another interesting prospect for affected cities. Whether that treatment is adhered to is one of the strongest predictors of a patient\u2019s recidivism, Saloner said.\n\nMany experts like Saloner argue that criminalizing addiction, which is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)\u2014 as part of the nation\u2019s \u2018war on drugs\u2019\u2014 has failed, leading to recidivism and wasted tax dollars.\n\n\u201cWe tried criminalizing addiction, and we didn\u2019t make a dent in the epidemic\u2014and in some ways, we made it worse by driving a lot of harmful behaviors in the ground,\u201d Saloner said. \u201cYou don\u2019t make a meaningful or sustained impact on this problem until you create a collaborative and person-centered model, until you recognize this is someone with a medical condition.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) required plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace to cover substance use disorder services, but overcoming stigma is one of the biggest hurdles faced by doctors and patients affected by opioid addiction.\n\n\u201cWhat our best evidence would suggest is that using rhetoric that really stigmatizes or creates a kind of a moralistic set of overtones about addiction is not helpful in getting those people into treatment,\u201d Saloner said, \u201cso if were really serious about getting those people into treatment, we need to focus on a more positive and inclusive message.\u201d\n\nOfficials in Baltimore have implemented a 24/7 hotline that residents can call to seek treatment, and the city is starting a stabilization center to provide around-the-clock emergency room care for addiction and mental health. They also are aiming to prevent addiction from happening in the first place and reduce stigma through ad campaigns, like the city\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Die\u201d campaign, online and on billboards.\n\nLeveling the playing field\n\nFor officials like Wen, who have been fighting this epidemic long before it surpassed the bounds of inner cities, the government\u2019s proposed funding offers promise for more equality in health care.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had people of color dying in inner cities for decades, and it\u2019s often been said that if they\u2019re poor and insured, that it is their choice and that becomes a criminal justice issue, but if someone is wealthy and insured, then it becomes a medical issue,\u201d Wen said. \u201cIt\u2019s reached jurisdictions across the country, but at the same time we\u2019re glad that there is national attention for this public health crisis.\u201d\n\nUltimately, combatting the epidemic will mean arming doctors and patients with the right resources and knowledge.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve yet to meet a doctor or any provider of any kind who wants to get their patients addicted to drugs or wants their patients to overdose,\u201d Wen added, \u201cSo it\u2019s not about keeping doctors in check, it\u2019s about giving them the tools they need to allow them to make the best decisions for their patients.\u201d", "article_metadata":
