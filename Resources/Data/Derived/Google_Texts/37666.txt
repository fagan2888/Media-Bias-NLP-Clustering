Colorado became the latest state to have a federal judge strike down its state ban on same sex marriage on Wednesday. The court ruled that disallowing gay marriage was unconstitutional, but as with previous rulings elsewhere, imposed a temporary stay on the implementation of the decision until a potential appeal can be heard. “The Wednesday ruling marks the 25th district court ruling against a gay marriage ban since last year’s Supreme Court rulings,” according to the Los Angeles Times.
