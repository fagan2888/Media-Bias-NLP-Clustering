Residents at an assisted living facility were evacuated early Saturday morning after a small fire started in the kitchen.

Springs firefighters responded to Crestview Assisted Living on Buena Ventura Street around 2:30 a.m., and quickly put the fire out.

A CSFD battalion chief told 11 News the fire caused "minimal" damage, primarily to kitchen cabinets.

Because the facility is a four-plex, only the residents in the affected unit were evacuated.
