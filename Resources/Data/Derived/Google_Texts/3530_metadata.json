The requirement to make an account before viewing options was considered one of the main causes for the site\u2019s initial traffic bottleneck. \u201cIt\u2019s terrific, I\u2019ve tried it, it was working yesterday through the busiest times,\u201d Metcalf said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "ACA opponents were heavily invested in Consumer Reports' concerns about healthcare.gov.
