We at the New Jersey chapter of the American Institute of Architects are very pleased with the governor's recent signing of good Samaritan legislation that will shield licensed architects and engineers from liability when they volunteer to help local municipalities respond to natural disasters.

Bill A2025 has received widespread support from both the Assembly and the Senate. By removing prohibitive regulations against building design professionals, the act will allow trained architects and other professionals to quickly and effectively respond to pressing infrastructural issues in times of emergency.

The legislation reflects the mission of the AIA to contribute its collective expertise when it is needed most, which is crucial in the planning and rebuilding of New Jersey's communities.

We commend lead sponsor Majority Leader Lou Greenwald, along with sponsors Paul Moriarity and Upendra Chivukula, for their sound and rational advocacy of the bill.
