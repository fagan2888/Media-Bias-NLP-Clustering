Tecklenburg was the first candidate to announce he would run for mayor.\n\nMaurice Washington, who entered the race later than most of the other candidates, said he has participated in more than 20 forums.\n\nWilliam Dudley Gregorie said the smaller, in-person gatherings were good for candidates who don\u2019t have a lot of money and can\u2019t afford TV spots.\n\nThe election is Nov. 3 with a Nov. 17 run-off likely between the top two vote-getters.\n\nSanford will support Paul Ryan\n\nU.S. Rep. Mark Sanford said he will support Wisconsin Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan for House Speaker in the election this week.\n\nSanford, R-S.C., is one of the approximately three-dozen members of the sometimes unruly, anti-spending House Freedom Caucus conservatives who contributed to John Boehner\u2019s decision to quit.\n\n\u201cI believe that a Ryan speakership represents the best opportunity for conservative members to have their voices heard, to advance conservative policy and to restore unity to the House Republican Conference,\u201d Sanford said.\n\nO\u2019Malley was here for money, too\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley visited North Charleston last week to advocate for gun control in the wake of the Emanuel AME Church shooting, and to speak to students at the College of Charleston.\n\nBut he was also here to raise some campaign cash.\n\nAn invitation to a reception, held at Victor Social Club on John Street in Charleston, requested $2,700 per person to be a co-host of the event, while young professionals or students could attend for a mere $45 and $25, respectively.\n\nThe event was hosted by local attorney Mullins McLeod, Charleston City Councilman Rodney Williams, consultant Phil Noble, former lieutenant governor candidate Ashley Cooper and former lawmaker Boyd Brown.\n\nHutto makes case she\u2019s a Republican\n\nFormer Democratic state Rep. Anne Peterson-Hutto of James Island is setting the groundwork for a return to politics with a probable run for Paul Thurmond\u2019s soon-to-be-open state Senate seat.\n\nHutto earlier this month appeared at the Charleston County GOP meeting to introduce herself and explain why she\u2019s had a political change of heart.\n\n\u201cI voted Republican in the last primary,\u201d said Peterson-Hutto, adding that she fully supports Gov. Nikki Haley.\n\nThurmond announced earlier he would not seek re-election next year to his Senate District 41 seat. The seat runs from James Island into West Ashley and Dorchester County.\n\nSeveral Republicans and Democrats have shown an interest, as well.\n\nHutto served as a Democrat in the state House for one term representing James Island from 2008-2010. She is currently a lobbyist representing the Coastal Conservation League, among other interests.\n\nBobby Harrell makes Mount Pleasant GOP appearance\n\nFormer House Speaker Bobby Harrell was in the audience last week when the man who succeeded him, current House Speaker Jay Lucas, addressed Mount Pleasant Republicans.\n\nLucas, R-Hartsville, was giving his standard lunchtime speech about the upcoming session and gave a shout-out to the Charleston Republican, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s great to see Speaker Harrell.\u201d\n\nHarrell, who resigned his post last year after his Statehouse ethics case conviction, sat with his son, Trey Harrell, who is interested in following his father into politics as a potential GOP candidate for a Mount Pleasant seat in the S.C. House of Representatives next year.\n\nGraham in the undercard Wednesday\n\nCNBC has finalized the lineup for its debate Wednesday in Boulder, Colo., and for the third showdown in a row U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is assigned to the undercard.\n\nGraham\u2019s poll numbers in several recent surveys did not crack the 2.5 percent average to make it on the main stage. He will go on at 6 p.m. Eastern time along with Bobby Jindal, Rick Santorum and George Pataki.\n\nThe main event at 8 p.m. includes Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Marco Rubio, Carly Fiorina, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Chris Christie, Mike Huckabee, John Kasich and Rand Paul.\n\nThe Charleston County GOP is holding a debate watch Wednesday night at Cinebarre in Mount Pleasant, beginning at 7:30 p.m.\n\nPresidential visits this week:\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Friday is the keynote speaker at the Charleston Branch NAACP\u2019s 98th annual Freedom Fund Banquet at the Charleston Area Convention Center in North Charleston.\n\nCompiled by Schuyler Kropf and Diane Knich", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Debates all done in Charleston mayor\u2019s race, Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nNews, \r\nLocal Politics, \r\nFederal Politics, \r\nElections, \r\nElections, Charleston mayoral race,Charleston NAACP,Hillary Clinton,Lindsey Graham,Mark Sanford,Paul Ryan", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "That\u2019s it for face-offs in the Charleston mayor\u2019s race.", "title": "Debates all done in Charleston mayor\u2019s race", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20151024/151029683/debates-all-done-in-charleston-mayor-x2019-s-race", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151024/PC1603/151029683/AR/0/AR-151029683.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151024/PC1603/151029683/AR/0/AR-151029683.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "That\u2019s it for face-offs in the Charleston mayor\u2019s race.", "title": "Debates all done in Charleston mayor\u2019s race", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Palmetto Politics", "iphone": "Palmetto Politics", "googleplay": "Palmetto Politics"}, "id": {"ipad": 897497885, "iphone": 897497885, "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.eveningpostpublishingcompany.palmettopolitics"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20151024/PC1603/151029683/AR/0/AR-151029683.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 151029683}}, "keywords": "Debates all done in Charleston mayor\u2019s race , Politics, \r\nPoliticsFP LatestNews, \r\nNews, \r\nLocal Politics, \r\nFederal Politics, \r\nElections, \r\nElections, Charleston mayoral race,Charleston NAACP,Hillary Clinton,Lindsey Graham,Mark Sanford,Paul Ryan", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-24T18:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-10-23T17:07:00Z"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "That\u2019s it for face-offs in the Charleston mayor\u2019s race."}, "article_summary": "Bobby Harrell makes Mount Pleasant GOP appearanceFormer House Speaker Bobby Harrell was in the audience last week when the man who succeeded him, current House Speaker Jay Lucas, addressed Mount Pleasant Republicans.\nHutto served as a Democrat in the state House for one term representing James Island from 2008-2010.\nThat\u2019s it for face-offs in the Charleston mayor\u2019s race.\nHutto earlier this month appeared at the Charleston County GOP meeting to introduce herself and explain why she\u2019s had a political change of heart.\nThe Charleston County GOP is holding a debate watch Wednesday night at Cinebarre in Mount Pleasant, beginning at 7:30 p.m.Presidential visits this week:Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Friday is the keynote speaker at the Charleston Branch NAACP\u2019s 98th annual Freedom Fund Banquet at the Charleston Area Convention Center in North Charleston."}
