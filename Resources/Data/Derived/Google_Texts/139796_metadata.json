In January 2013, Trueblood was placed on a 100% payment hold and, as a result, the practice was forced to quickly shut all its doors and fire all of its dentists and staff.\n\nBut in an agreement finalized last Thursday by Doug Wilson, Inspector General of HHSC-OIG, the State agreed to accept $39,211 out of the initial reimbursement claim of $16,209,289 (Settlement Agreement). The settlement expressly states that Trueblood admits no liability for fraud or overpayment. Trueblood in turn releases the State from any liability for the State\u2019s investigation and improper payment hold. Given that the State has withheld over $100,000 of Trueblood\u2019s Medicaid monies, the settlement should result in an immediate return payment to the practice.\n\nTrueblood was formerly the dental affiliate of Carousel Pediatrics, one of Austin\u2019s few Medicaid providers; Carousel settled with the OIG earlier this year. Carousel\u2019s case \u2014 and by extension, Trueblood\u2019s \u2014 gained media attention in late 2012 as the practice gained the support of TMA and HMO allies in its fight against the agency\u2019s recoupment effort. OIG insisted that its case was sound and its methods appropriate, but allies decried the State\u2019s draconian actions. According to TMA\u2019s general counsel, the case was \u201cnuts, this is not fraud, this is a dispute over coding errors.\u201d\n\nFraud, or Paperwork Issues?\n\nA core point of contention, and confusion, has been the precise extent of OIG\u2019s power to enforce payment holds base on \u201ccredible allegations of fraud\u201d (\u201cCAF\u201d).\n\nOIG claims their application of the regulatory tool is authorized by the Affordable Care Act, as well as State Law, but detractors counter that the State\u2019s implementation goes far beyond the mandate of either the Federal Government or the State of Texas. Controversial new administrative rules from 2012 enabled OIG\u2019s current practice of implementing CAF holds based, not on actual fraud (that is, criminal misrepresentation meant to deceive) but rather upon simple errors, or \u201cprogram violations\u201d. According to the TMA, the rules \u201ccast every Medicaid billing error as a possible target for fraud-and-abuse prosecution.\u201d\n\nThe rules themselves are unambiguous, stating \u201cOIG may impose a payment hold against any person (who) commits a program violation\u201d (any transgression of Medicaid rules, such as failing to sign a form, is a program violation). This is a drastic overreach by HHSC when compared to federal and state law, which only authorize payment holds based upon actual fraud. Perhaps for this reason, the agency has continued to hint that its enforcement actions are somehow justified by criminal acts on the part of providers.\n\nWhen Trueblood was shutdown as a result of OIG\u2019s stringent payment hold \u2014 based on allegations of \u201c99% fraud\u201d \u2014 HHSC spokesperson Stephanie Goodman implied the providers were criminals: \u201cContinuing Medicaid payments to offices with highly suspect billing practices doesn\u2019t help children\u201d she said to the Austin-American Statesman.\n\nNo Meat on that Dog Bone\n\nThe OIG\u2019s message of rampant \u201cfraud\u201d in dental Medicaid upset the State\u2019s politicians in the 2013 session.\n\nIn an early 2013 hearing because of OIG\u2019s allegations, Sen. Jane Nelson (R \u2013 Flower Mound) singled out Carousel, and in particular their dental practice (Trueblood). \u201cThe Office of Inspector General shared with us some really harmful things that he told us are happening to children in some of our dental clinics,\u201d said Nelson. \u201cI am going to be like a dog on a bone to make sure we don\u2019t have any fraudulent activity on our whole dental and medical spectrum.\u201d Based on the allegations, Nelson had good justification for the remarks. But now it appears there was no fraud on that dog bone and never was. That will be upsetting too.\n\nUnfortunately, the exchange set the tone for the entire session. Inspector General Wilson had already tripled the number of Medicaid investigators in 2011. He obtained more funding in the 2013 legislative session towards further expansion of OIG\u2019s war on \u201cfraud\u201d.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with having a strong agency to fight Medicaid fraud. Texas must have this. But the fruits of this expenditure should surely lead to finding some actual Medicaid fraud and, while doing so, not trample Medicaid providers\u2019 due process rights in its processes, destroying practices and careers.\n\nIt\u2019s still innocent until proven guilty even for Medicaid dentists and providers.\n\nPatience Wearing Thin\n\nMore recent hearings before State Senators indicates that the Legislature\u2019s patience may be wearing thin for the OIG\u2019s practice of alleging fraud and closing businesses, but ultimately admitting that the provider did not commit fraud.\n\nIn an August 14, 2014, hearing before the Legislature, attorney Jason Ray stated, \u201cThe fact is, when a law enforcement agency like the OIG alleges that a Medicaid provider is a \u2018fraudster\u2019, then uses a payment hold as leverage to extract money and allows the alleged \u201cfraudsters\u201d to stay in the Medicaid system, the OIG\u2019s actions begin to look less like law enforcement, and more like a shakedown.\u201d\n\nMr. Ray represented Trueblood in the case and negotiated Trueblood\u2019s settlement with the State.\n\nNo more Medicaid Doctors\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what changed between the OIG\u2019s revelations of \u201creally harmful things\u201d \u2014 so harmful that they merited a $16.2 million reimbursement claim \u2014 and their settlement for a mere $40,000.\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear who\u2019s benefited from the State\u2019s action. Given that the case proceeded for over 18 months before a State administrative judge, the State certainly did not recover the costs of its investigation. Meanwhile, the disruption to Trueblood\u2019s business was immediate and catastrophic \u2014 its owner shut the doors immediately.\n\nAnd then there are the patients\n\nThe previously cited TMA piece stated that \u201c(a)ccording to TMA\u2019s 2012 survey, Texas physicians available to treat all new Medicaid patients plummeted from 42 percent in 2010 to 31 percent \u2014 an all-time low.\u201d The State can now add another Medicaid provider to that pile \u2014 Trueblood Associates is out of Medicaid for good.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Trueblood withdrew from Medicaid as a provider.\n\nWho can blame them but it is young Medicaid patients in need of care that lose out the most.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/wp-content/uploads/fbrfg/browserconfig.xml", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"State Settles $16 Million Medicaid Fraud Case for Less Than $40,0000\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.tdmr.org\\/state-settles-16-million-medicaid-fraud-case-400000\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-08-25 16:20:31\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-08-27 13:32:29\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":2396,\"author_id\":\"3\",\"author_name\":\"Al Anthony\",\"author_display_name\":\"TDMR\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Medicaid Reform News\",\"Slider\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/www.tdmr.org\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/fraud.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "Texas Dentists for Medicaid Reform", "description": "In a stunning reversal of their previous hard-line stance, State regulators have settled a high profile \u201cfraud\u201d case for less than a penny on the dollar.
