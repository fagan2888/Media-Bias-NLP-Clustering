Harry Warren of Rowan County says the legislation has nothing to do with immigration, and would establish a more uniform system of ID cards for the law enforcement community.\n\nCritics said House Bill 328 (the Highway Safety/Citizens Protection Act) is a step toward amnesty, warning lawmakers that constituents would voice their opposition in the next election cycle.\n\nFred Baggett with the North Carolina Association of Chiefs of Police spoke in favor of the bill noting that a standard form of identification would be useful to officers statewide.\n\nThe bill would need the approval of the House Finance Committee before heading to the House floor.\n\nTo learn about other restrictions and what it takes to actually obtain 12-month permit, read HB 328.
