Last week, Raise.com said it bought Tastebud, formerly called StyleSeek, and its staff of 10. GoHealth says that Creatix's 35 employees will join the company.\n\nGoHealth, an online health-insurance portal, has been one of Chicago's fastest-growing tech companies in recent years.\n\nThe company has hired about 20 tech workers so far this year, and it plans to add another 20 by year-end, said co-founder Brandon Cruz.\n\n\u201cWe've hired a lot of tech people already,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's nice when you can grab a huge group at one time. We've worked with them for a while. It just made sense for us to hire them and give them a ton more work.\u201d\n\nGoHealth's acquisition of Creatix reflects the increased demand in an already-tight labor market.\n\n\u201cTalent is at such a premium right now,\u201d says David Belsky, regional director at Jobspring Partners, a tech-recruiting firm in Chicago. \u201cIf there's a small team that's already been established in a niche that a company needs, (acquisition) makes sense. Companies are throwing more resources at hiring, working with more third parties as part of that strategy.\u201d\n\nAlex Bratton, CEO of mobile-application developer Lextech, predicts the \"acqui-hires\" will continue, though his firm has a different strategy. The company, which has offices in Chicago, Downers Grove and Champaign, plans to step up its college recruiting. \u201cMeshing of two cultures is a huge risk.\"\n\nTerms of the Creatix deal weren't disclosed. Creatix is based in Chicago, but most of its staff is in Bratislava, Slovakia. \u201cWe'll be adding staff in both places,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nGoHealth provides technology used by insurers to operate online exchanges to enroll and manage customers. The business, which got a boost from the Affordable Care Act, is growing 20 percent to 30 percent annually.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "timeCrawled": "20160526_10:09:21", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150901/BLOGS11/150909973/AR/0/gohealth-buys-software-firm.jpg&maxw=400", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "GoHealth buys software firm"}, "published_at": "2015-9-1", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//BLOGS11/150909973", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more.", "byline": "John Pletz", "title": "GoHealth buys software firm", "taxo_People": "Brandon Cruz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "taxo_Writers": "John Pletz on Technology", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150901/BLOGS11/150909973/AR/0/gohealth-buys-software-firm.jpg", "categoryName": "Blogs - On Technology", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "Raise.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "taxo_Industries": "Software", "summary": "As talent gets harder to find, fast-growing companies buy as well as build.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "As talent gets harder to find, fast-growing companies buy as well as build.", "title": "GoHealth buys software firm", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150901/BLOGS11/150909973/gohealth-buys-software-firm", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150901/BLOGS11/150909973/AR/0/gohealth-buys-software-firm.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca7b1\"", "article_summary": "It's the latest acquisition of a small company by a larger one that's rapidly increasing its tech ranks.\nThe company has hired about 20 tech workers so far this year, and it plans to add another 20 by year-end, said co-founder Brandon Cruz.\nGoHealth acquired Creatix, a small software-development shop that has done work for the company, a sign of how hard it is to find tech talent.\n\u201cIf there's a small team that's already been established in a niche that a company needs, (acquisition) makes sense.\n\u201cTalent is at such a premium right now,\u201d says David Belsky, regional director at Jobspring Partners, a tech-recruiting firm in Chicago."}
