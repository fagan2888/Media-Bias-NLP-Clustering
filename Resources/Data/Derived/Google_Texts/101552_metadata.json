But he's far less certain how many of his 350-400 eligible nonmanagement employees will.\n\n\n\n\"That is the big, big, big unknown,\" he said.\n\n\n\nAnsara's Farmington Hills-based Ansara Restaurant Group operates 22 Red Robin outlets in Michigan and northwest Ohio. The restaurant group's share per employee will be $2,000 to $2,500 per year, while employees will pay $1,000 to $1,500, he said.\n\n\n\nThe company had to tweak its plans recently when Washington delayed by one year the deadline for companies to provide basic coverage for full-time workers, resetting it to Jan. 1, 2015. Ansara said he would go ahead with the meetings and inform employees about online marketplaces to buy health insurance that are to go live Oct. 1.\n\n\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, companies with 50 or more full-time, eligible workers must either provide basic coverage by the deadline or face fines of $2,000 per employee.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Restaurateur Victor Ansara has schooled himself on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a task he's sure many of his hundreds of employees have skipped.
