The actor, who we're used to seeing wink at the camera as the charming and harmless Jim Halpert, buffed up to play the role of security contractor Jack Silva for the new Michael Bay-directed film 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi. The movie, which will be released by Paramount Pictures this Friday, allows us to see Krasinski's grittier side.\n\nHe did his homework for the role. Not only did Krasinski spend four months in intense training (watch below to hear him describe the painful Bulgarian split squat), but he also read the book behind the film, \"13 Hours,\" to get a full account from three of the soldiers who were in the fight to defend the U.S. consulate. What the actor discovered was that he knew \"embarrassingly\" little about what actually happened on September 11, 2012. That, he suggested, is thanks to an overly politicized news cycle that does a disservice to the heroes who served that night. He shared with Townhall how grateful he was to portray one of the secret soldiers who willingly defied orders to \"stand down\" and put themselves in harm's way to save 36 American lives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"The Office\" actor regrets how politicized the story behind Benghazi has become..05/26/2016 18:07:59PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "\"The Office\" actor regrets how politicized the story behind Benghazi has become.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Exclusive: '13 Hours' Star John Krasinski Says Politicizing Benghazi Has Overshadowed The Heroes", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/01/12/exclusive-13-hours-star-john-krasinski-talks-about-how-the-politics-of-benghazi-has-overshadowed-the-heroes-n2103087", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/1/11/21.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "\"The Office\" actor regrets how politicized the story behind Benghazi has become.", "title": "Cortney O'Brien - Exclusive: '13 Hours' Star John Krasinski Says Politicizing Benghazi Has Overshadowed The Heroes", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/01/12/exclusive-13-hours-star-john-krasinski-talks-about-how-the-politics-of-benghazi-has-overshadowed-the-heroes-n2103087", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/1/11/21.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Exclusive: '13 Hours' Star John Krasinski Says Politicizing Benghazi Has Overshadowed The Heroes, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "John Krasinski left \"The Office\" far behind him in the dangerous streets of Benghazi, Libya.\nHe shared with Townhall how grateful he was to portray one of the secret soldiers who willingly defied orders to \"stand down\" and put themselves in harm's way to save 36 American lives.\nThat, he suggested, is thanks to an overly politicized news cycle that does a disservice to the heroes who served that night.\nThe actor, who we're used to seeing wink at the camera as the charming and harmless Jim Halpert, buffed up to play the role of security contractor Jack Silva for the new Michael Bay-directed film 13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi.\nWhat the actor discovered was that he knew \"embarrassingly\" little about what actually happened on September 11, 2012."}
