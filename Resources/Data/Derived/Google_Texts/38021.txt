"I think Amazon is the analogy. Amazon is the engine for many online stores.... In this case, there's just no reason for many states to operate their own health-care exchange."

"When the law was first being implemented, there was enormous symbolic significance attached to states starting up their own exchanges," Levitt said. "It was a sign of momentum and that the law was working. And for a number of blue state governors, it seemed attractive politically to get behind Obamacare."



"Now that the law's in place, and the Supreme Court has said that subsidies are available in all states, there's really much less imperative for states to be running these things," he said. "I think the court's decision is very liberating for the states."

Operating an exchange is "a really big hassle and it's really expensive," Levitt said. "And, particularly the smaller states have a tough time financing their operations to scale."

In five years, Levitt said, "I wouldn't be surprised if half of the state exchanges are no longer operating," or at least no longer handling eligibility and enrollment functions for their residents.

Asked if he could envision just one or two state exchanges, Levitt said, "That would surprise me, but it wouldn't shock me."

Either way, he expects the main survivors to be large states, such as California and New York, whose exchanges have economies of scale that aren't available to smaller states.

"HealthCare.gov is not perfect, but it's getting better, and it'll continue to improve," Levitt said. "I think Amazon is the analogy. Amazon is the engine for many online stores, and there's really just not a reason for every mom-and-pop e-commerce operation to build their own shopping website. In this case, there's just no reason for many states to operate their own health-care exchange."
