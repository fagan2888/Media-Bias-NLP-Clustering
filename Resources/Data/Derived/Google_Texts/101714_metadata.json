Fifty-six percent of the respondents who believed coffee increases risk for heart disease said they got this information online, in a newspaper or magazine, or on TV. Perhaps surprisingly 16 percent said they got their information from a doctor, nurse, or dietician.\n\nBut in reality, recent studies have shown drinking three to five cups of coffee a day can improve alertness, as well as reduce risk for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive decline.\n\n\"Key dietary messages such as 'consume five portions of fruit and vegetables a day' and 'eat less fat, salt and sugar' are well known, [but] many remain unaware of the potential health benefits of coffee,\" panelist Chris Seal, professor of food and human nutrition at Newcastle University, said. \"Helping people to understand how regular daily consumption of 3 to 5 cups of coffee might reduce their risk of certain diseases and long-term health conditions could prompt behavior change.\"\n\nBased on scientific evidence, panelists believe coffee can be part of a healthy balanced lifestyle. The beverage provides small amounts of the nutrients potassium, magnesium, and niacin \u2014 all of which are good for heart and bone health. This is true for breastfeeding and pregnant women, too: Studies find women can drink two cups of coffee (200 milligrams) a day without harming the fetus or infant.\n\nPanelists concluded both consumers and health care professionals need more \"up-to-date, science-based information\" when it comes to drinking coffee.\n\n\"Coffee is often drunk to accompany or conclude a meal therefore it's important that consumers understand the value of what they're drinking as well as eating,\" panelist Dr. Agn\u00e8s Giboreau, research director at the Institut Paul Bocuse in France, said. \"Personal habits, such as the way someone takes their coffee, are often based on experiences and cultural backgrounds, and so changing behavior must be consistent with culture, beliefs and typical habits.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "consumers, are, confused, about, potential, health, benefits, drinking, coffee, finds, survey", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Health care professions need more accurate, science-based information on the effects of drinking coffee that they can discuss and share with their patients.", "title": "Consumers Are Confused About The Potential Health Benefits Of Coffee", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/health-benefits-drinking-coffee-misinformation-376739", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/06/coffee-confusion.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Health care professions need more accurate, science-based information on the effects of drinking coffee that they can discuss and share with their patients.", "title": "Consumers Are Confused About The Potential Health Benefits Of Coffee", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/health-benefits-drinking-coffee-misinformation-376739", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/06/coffee-confusion.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/06/coffee-confusion.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2016-03-06T21:24:15-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-06T21:24:15-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Health care professions need more accurate, science-based information on the effects of drinking coffee that they can discuss and share with their patients."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd19c4\"", "article_summary": "Panelists concluded both consumers and health care professionals need more \"up-to-date, science-based information\" when it comes to drinking coffee.\nPhoto courtesy of Flickr, Mike HauserPeople are really confused about coffee, according to a new survey from the Institute for Scientific Information on Coffee (ISIC).\nHealth care professions need more accurate, science-based information on the effects of drinking coffee that they can discuss and share with their patients.\nTurns out, nearly 50 percent of survey respondents believed coffee causes health problems.\nThe survey, which was given to coffee and non-coffee drinkers alike, suggests the main reason consumers are confused about the potential health benefits of coffee is because they receive information that's \"not always in line with the latest research.\""}
