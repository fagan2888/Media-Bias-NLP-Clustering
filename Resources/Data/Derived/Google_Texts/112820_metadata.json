(Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nA major opponent of Obamacare is doubling down in Louisiana ahead of the start of that state\u2019s 2014 legislative session.\n\nThe state chapter of Americans for Prosperity \u2014 the national tea party group founded by brothers Charles and David Koch \u2014 launched on Jan. 2 and is pressing each of Louisiana\u2019s 144 lawmakers to pledge opposition to expanding Medicaid under the law.\n\n\u201cFor our state legislative session, this is priority number one,\u201d says AFP-Louisiana State Director Phillip Joffrion. The group sent out pledges to each member of the state\u2019s House and Senate on Friday morning and expects the lawmakers to begin receiving the pledges by early next week. The effort is matched by a seven-city town hall tour in advance of the March 10 start of the legislative session.\n\nFighting Medicaid expansion in Louisiana will be one of the state AFP chapter\u2019s top priorities during the session. Others include: tort reform, education reform that protects or strengthens state rights and weakens federal control, reducing government regulations, and opposing tax increases (though, he notes, this is a non-fiscal session).\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to support lowering taxes and reducing the size of government as well as fighting Medicaid expansion,\u201d Joffrion says.\n\nThe chapter is targeting federal lawmakers in its anti-expansion push, too. The group launched this year with a $600,000 ad buy against Sen. Mary Landrieu (D) over her support for Obamacare. (Landrieu\u2019s race is one to watch \u2014 it\u2019s ranked sixth on The Fix\u2019s list of the top 10 Senate races of the year.)\n\nDespite the pressure, Landrieu has continued her push for expansion, encouraging residents to sign a petition urging Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) to opt in.\n\n\u201cThis is her reconfirming, recommitting her vote on Obamacare,\u201d Joffrion said.\n\nExactly half of states are moving forward with expansion, while 21 are not. Four are considering it. Studies have shown certain downsides to refusing expansion. Louisiana, for example, stands to lose $1.7 billion in federal funds through 2022, according to the pro-reform Commonwealth Fund. Tax services company Jackson Hewitt said in a January report that Louisiana employers may face anywhere from $42 million to $61 million in annual tax penalties.\n\nThe federal government will pay the full cost of expansion for the first three years and 90 percent annually thereafter, but opponents say there\u2019s no guarantee that Congress won\u2019t simply vote to change that funding formula as needed.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The state chapter of Americans for Prosperity wants lawmakers to pledge opposition to expanding Medicaid.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/journalistniraj", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The state chapter of Americans for Prosperity wants lawmakers to pledge opposition to expanding Medicaid.", "title": "The Koch brothers\u2019 group is getting involved in Louisiana\u2019s Obamacare fight", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/02/08/the-koch-brothers-group-is-getting-involved-in-louisianas-obamacare-fight/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/files/2014/02/teaparty_image_982w.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@NirajC"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/02/08/the-koch-brothers-group-is-getting-involved-in-louisianas-obamacare-fight/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "medicaid, louisiana, americans for prosperity, koch brothers, koch, obamacare,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/journalistniraj"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "medicaid, louisiana, americans for prosperity, koch brothers, koch, obamacare,"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2d37\"", "article_summary": "\u201cFor our state legislative session, this is priority number one,\u201d says AFP-Louisiana State Director Phillip Joffrion.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here to support lowering taxes and reducing the size of government as well as fighting Medicaid expansion,\u201d Joffrion says.\nFighting Medicaid expansion in Louisiana will be one of the state AFP chapter\u2019s top priorities during the session.\nThe chapter is targeting federal lawmakers in its anti-expansion push, too.\nThe group launched this year with a $600,000 ad buy against Sen.
