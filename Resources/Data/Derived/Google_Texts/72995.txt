Obamacare: Signed, Sealed, Delivering#FailedObamacareSlogans — Kitty Chi (@KittyChi) October 24, 2013

OFA tools are driving around with humiliating “Obamacare: Signed. Sealed. Delivering …” stickers on their cars. And Kathleen Sebelius went all in with a July blog post that insisted, “It’s signed, sealed, and it’s delivering – on time.”

On. Time.

Her blog post also included this now-hilarious graphic.

We don’t have enough “bless your hearts” to go around! But citizen editors are happy to help Sebelius and OFA revise their jump-the-gun sloganeering.
