Highly educated, highly experienced nurses will be in a role to cover the GP (general practitioner) role.\u201d\n\nThe Association of American Medical Colleges reports that by 2015 there will be a deficit of 62,900 physicians. By 2025, that rate will be 130,000 physicians across all specialties.\n\nKirschling said there has been much research done over the past 20 years that supports an increased need for highly-educated nurses, especially in the hospital setting, to help quell the primary-care physician shortage. Those roles would include nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives and clinical nurse specialists.\n\n\u201cWith the Affordable Care Act and more people now having insurance, the demand for primary care is increasing,\u201d Kirschling said. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important associates come back to get their bachelor\u2019s.\u201d\n\nKirschling said there has been growth in RN-to-BSN enrollment, with now more than 300 programs across the nation being offered in-part or completely online.\n\n\u201cAccessibility is no longer a limiting factor,\u201d Kirschling said.\n\nAt the College of Nursing at University of Cincinnati, a \u201crobust\u201d online program has been created for prospective nurse practitioners to access across the U.S., said Greer Glazer, dean of the College of Nursing. A similar program is offered at Miami University.\n\nGlazer said the College of Nursing has 1,600 graduate students, and an additional 1,028 undergraduate students enrolled in nursing programs.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re helping deal with the primary care situation by increasing graduate numbers,\u201d Glazer said.\n\nGlazer said nursing curriculum has changed in recent years to have a stronger emphasis on organization and system leadership, evidence-based practice, policy and finance, and population health.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing happening is acceptance of the nurse practitioner role as primary-care providers,\u201d Glazer said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough primary-care physicians to take care of the people who need health care.\u201d\n\nThe main differences between the role of nurse practitioner and primary-care physician is that physicians diagnose and treat more complex patients, while nurse practitioners focus more on health promotion and disease prevention while still diagnosing and treating minor and chronic illness, according to Glazer.\n\nRegistered nurse Angela Lowry, who works at Bethesda North Hospital in Montgomery, is a graduate student at UC in the nurse practitioner program for primary adult care. She graduates in April after balancing the program over the past two years while maintaining full-time hours at work.\n\n\u201cThere is such a physician shortage going on in primary care, we always talk about the nurse shortage, but we need more primary-care providers,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cNurse practitioners can really fill that void.\u201d\n\nLowry said the need for nurse care coordinators is evident to her in her daily job. She said patients being discharged from the hospital are often \u201ctoo sick to understand discharge instructions\u201d and unable to \u201cgrasp their conditions and needs when they go home.\u201d\n\nLowry said the need to track patients after they leave the hospital is increasingly important as reimbursement rates for hospitals are tied to 30-day readmission rates. She said her nursing curriculum puts an emphasis on preventive care and lowering re-hospitalization among patients with chronic conditions.\n\n\u201cI want to get out of the hospital and into a primary-care setting to follow up with patients and collaborate with doctors for better outcomes,\u201d Lowry said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than a million registered nursing positions will need to be filled over the next six years, but officials say several barriers remain in place for the education of qualified nurses.", "og": {"url": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/increasing-need-for-nurses-in-primary-care-role/nc2PY/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/01/24/2f/e0/jn012314nursingneeds-5p.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "More than a million registered nursing positions will need to be filled over the next six years, but officials say several barriers remain in place for the education of qualified nurses.", "title": "Increasing need for nurses in primary care role"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2014/01/24/90/ae/jn012314nursingneeds-1p.jpg", "description": "More than a million registered nursing positions will need to be filled over the next six years, but officials say several barriers remain in place for the education of qualified nurses.", "site": "@journalnews", "card": "summary", "title": "Increasing need for nurses in primary care role"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "journal-news", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/increasing-need-for-nurses-in-primary-care-role/nc2PY/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2266969/news/news/increasing-need-for-nurses-in-primary-care-role/nc2PY/", "keywords": "HJNhptop,HJNhomepage", "google-site-verification": "4Q9_13tOch6eLcVYCHatUepAlnmJQbgHMCB16qdjcy0", "news_keywords": "HJNhptop,HJNhomepage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd30a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cNurse practitioners can really fill that void.\u201dLowry said the need for nurse care coordinators is evident to her in her daily job.\n\u201cWith the Affordable Care Act and more people now having insurance, the demand for primary care is increasing,\u201d Kirschling said.\n\u201cThere is such a physician shortage going on in primary care, we always talk about the nurse shortage, but we need more primary-care providers,\u201d Lowry said.\nThose roles would include nurse practitioners, certified registered nurse anesthetists, certified nurse-midwives and clinical nurse specialists.\nMore than a million registered nursing positions will need to be filled over the next six years, but officials say several barriers remain in place for the education of qualified nurses."}
