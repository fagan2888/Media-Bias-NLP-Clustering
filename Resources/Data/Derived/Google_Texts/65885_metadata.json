The wild swing in momentum came on the front nine, not the back nine of Augusta National. And the sweetest difference of all Sunday was seeing his 2-year-old son walk toward him on the edge of the 18th green after his three-shot victory over Jordan Spieth.\n\nWatson turned in another masterpiece and joined an elusive group as the 17th player to win the Masters more than once.\n\nHe turned a two-shot deficit into a two-shot lead on the final two holes of the front nine, then kept Spieth, 20, and everyone else at safe distance the rest of the way. Watson closed with a 3-under 69 to beat a pair of Masters rookies in Spieth and Jonas Blixt of Sweden.\n\nTwo years ago, when he hit that wild hook out of the trees on the 10th hole to win in a playoff, his wife and newly adopted son were watching at home in Florida. This time, young Caleb was decked out in a green-and-white striped Masters shirt and green tennis shoes as he waddled over to his father.\n\n\u201cThis one\u2019s a lot different,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThe first one, for me, it was almost like I lucked into it.\u201d\n\nAfter high-fiving the crowd on his way to sign his card, Watson returned to Butler Cabin to take back that green jacket he slipped on Adam Scott a year ago.\n\n\u201cAfter giving it away last year, I wanted it back,\u201d Watson said. \u201cI told Adam we could just swap it back and forth every year.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Bubba Watson win\u2019s Masters Tournament\n\nSpieth, trying to become the youngest Masters champion, could only watch from the side of the green.\n\nHe dazzled the massive crowd early by holing out for birdie from the front bunker on No. 4, and making back-to-back birdies to build a two-shot lead through seven holes. Bidding to become the first player in 35 years to win a green jacket in his first try, Spieth looked to be well on his way.\n\nBut he three-putted for bogey on No. 8 \u2014 the first 6 on his card all week \u2014 as Watson got up-and-down for birdie to tie for the lead. Spieth then made a rookie mistake, leaving his approach below the flagstick on No. 9 and watching it roll back into the fairway, setting up another bogey and two-shot swing.\n\nWhatever prayer he had might have ended at Amen Corner.\n\nHis tee shot on No. 12 found Rae\u2019s Creek. He missed a short birdie attempt on the 13th.\n\nWatson was too powerful, too experienced, too tough to beat. Spieth closed with six pars for a 72 and tied for second with Blixt, who never went away but never really threatened. Blixt shot a 71.\n\n\u201cThat was fun, but at the same time, it hurts right now,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cI wanted to get in contention on the back nine Sunday, but didn\u2019t come out on top.\u201d\n\nWatson finished at 8-under 280 and goes to a career-best No. 4 in the world.\n\nMiguel Angel Jimenez, the 50-year-old wonder from Spain, shot 71 and finished alone in fourth. Matt Kuchar lost a share of the lead with a four-putt double bogey on the fourth hole and never challenged again. He closed with a 74 and tied for fifth with Rickie Fowler (73).\n\nThis was nine holes of theater everyone expected out of Sunday at Augusta National \u2014 except it was the front nine.\n\nNine players were separated by three shots at the start of the final round only for this to turn into a two-man show.\n\nAfter trading pars on the opening hole, either Watson or Spieth \u2014 sometimes both \u2014 made birdie or bogey over the next nine holes.\n\nThey matched birdies on the par-3 fourth hole when Spieth holed out from the front bunker and Watson hit his tee shot into 4 feet. Spieth led by as many as two shots for most of the front nine, and his spectacular overshadowed a steady hand from Watson.\n\nTwo holes to close out the back nine changed everything. Amen Corner swung the Masters in Watson\u2019s favor for good.\n\nAbout the only excitement came on the par-5 15th hole, when Watson had a three-shot lead. He hit his tee shot well left, blocked by a few pine trees. Instead of laying up safely in front of the water, he hit through the trees with a shot that just cleared the false front of the green and went just over the back.\n\nAll he got was a par. Over the final hour, that\u2019s all he really needed.\n\nIt was his second win this year, and the victory puts Watson at the top of the Ryder Cup standings. He was guided all week by a simple game plan of hitting fairways and greens, and he was calmed by knowing that regardless of how it turned out, he still had a green jacket.\n\nNow he has two of them.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Bubba Watson wins another green jacket at Augusta", "title": "Bubba Watson wins another green jacket at Augusta", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/04/13/bubba-watson-wins-another-green-jacket-at-augusta/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140413__bubba-watsonp1.jpg", "height": 404}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140413__bubba-watsonp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-13T18:48:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T20:05:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ed7\"", "article_summary": "The only daring shot Watson hit was one he really didn\u2019t need.\nAUGUSTA, Ga. \u2014 Bubba Watson\u2019s second Masters title was nothing like the green jacket he won two years ago.\n4, and making back-to-back birdies to build a two-shot lead through seven holes.\nWatson turned in another masterpiece and joined an elusive group as the 17th player to win the Masters more than once.\nWatson closed with a 3-under 69 to beat a pair of Masters rookies in Spieth and Jonas Blixt of Sweden."}
