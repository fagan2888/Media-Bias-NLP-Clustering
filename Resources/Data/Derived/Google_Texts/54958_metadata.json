They wrote to Princeton University President Christopher Eisgruber and asked to meet with him to discuss preserving the freedom of speech and civil debate that are the hallmarks of a classical education. Evan Draim, a Princeton senior and one of the group\u2019s founders, told me in an email: \u201cWe hope that our peers at other colleges gain inspiration from what we are doing at Princeton.\u201d\n\nThe Black Justice League\u2019s demands include a dorm for those who want to celebrate black affinity; mandatory diversity training; and a requirement that students take a course on so-called marginalized peoples. They also want the renaming of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs and the removal of a mural of President Woodrow Wilson. Wilson, who graduated from Princeton in 1879 and who served as the university\u2019s president from 1902 until 1910, formally segregated the federal workforce.\n\nEisgruber has agreed to set aside four rooms on campus for the use of students of different cultures, and to consult with faculty and the board of trustees on other demands.\n\nAsanni York, a junior who helped organize the protests, said the university was not doing enough to address racial problems on campus, and that \u201cblack students on this campus feel uncomfortable every day.\u201d York told me: \u201cI\u2019m focused less on how President Eisgruber resolved the sit-in and more on how campus will change in the next two semesters.\u201d\n\nWilson was a racist by today\u2019s standards, but he was hardly a reactionary figure in his time. As university president, he tried unsuccessfully to disband Princeton\u2019s now-famous eating clubs on the grounds that they were elitist, and he pioneered the idea that Princeton should be a university \u201cin the nation\u2019s service.\u201d As America\u2019s president, Wilson substantially expanded the size and scope of the federal government including such institutions as the Federal Reserve Board.\n\nRelated: Yale, Mizzou and Others--Training a Generation of Proto-Fascists\n\nCampus protests are the latest in many students\u2019 efforts to be protected from situations that they find difficult. Some students are concerned about eliminating \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d \u2014 speech that might, intentionally or not, be offensive. They are asking for \u201ctrigger warnings\u201d so they can avoid material that might upset them. All of that results in limiting speech because, if something is potentially offensive, then, according to the new campus fads, it should not be said. And practically everything is potentially offensive to someone.\n\nThe fear of limiting speech is what led to the Princeton petition countering the Black Justice League\u2019s demands. The petition\u2019s signatories are concerned that eliminating any mention of Wilson constitutes \u201chistorical revisionism\u201d; that mandating what courses students have to take would allow the BJL undue power over the curriculum; and that having black-affinity housing would result in de facto campus segregation.\n\nThey suggest that a \u201cdiversity requirement\u201d should permit students to study any minority culture, not just a marginalized one, and that students should also have to take a course in Western civilization.\n\nOne of the Princeton Open Campus Coalition\u2019s members, Beni Snow, a freshman from Massachusetts, told me: \u201cI don\u2019t think of myself as fighting against the Black Justice League. I agree wholeheartedly that racism is an issue that needs to be addressed. I simply feel that the way to fight racism should not include methods that limit anyone\u2019s academic freedom.\u201d\n\nRelated: University of Michigan Fires a Shot at Free Speech\n\nNot only is the Black Justice League trying to squelch academic freedom, but it falsely added the signature of politics professor Robert George to the letter sent to President Eisgruber. George is the founder of the James Madison Society, which provides intellectual diversity by bringing conservative speakers to campus.\n\nGeorge wrote in a Facebook post: \u201cIn what is the most underhanded tactic I have encountered in 31 years in academic life, my name was fraudulently added to a petition supporting student protestors at Princeton. ... Needless to say, this is extremely distressing \u2014 especially because the issue concerns values I cherish and that I believe are being placed in peril on campuses around the country, including my own.\u201d\n\nIt used to be that education was about being challenged. Now some students want to be shielded from different views and debates. That will not prepare them for life after college. Let\u2019s hope that the example of the Princeton Open Campus Coalition will be emulated by students in universities around the country.\n\nThis piece was originally published in Market Watch.
