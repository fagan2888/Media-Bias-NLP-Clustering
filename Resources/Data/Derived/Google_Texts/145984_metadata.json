The ocean, not CO2 increase, is the primary driver for climate change.\u201d\n\nDr. Fred Goldberg, director of the Swedish Polar Institute and a leading authority on polar history and exploration, discussed how the extent of Arctic glaciers and sea ice have been highly variable over the past millennium. Though \u201cwarmists\u201d have cited some recent retreats in sea ice as evidence of man-caused warming, Goldberg showed that ice retreated dramatically in the 1920s \u2014 prompting US Weather Bureau fears of \u201ca radical change in climatic conditions and hitherto unheard-of-temperatures in the Arctic zone.\u201d But temperatures dropped again and the ice came back. By 1977, Goldberg noted, fears of a coming ice age dominated the press. To understand future ice conditions, we need to understand what the sun is doing, he said.\n\nComing to such an understanding is the goal of the research of Dr. Habibullo Abdussamatov, head of the Space Research Laboratory of the Pulkovo Observatory in St. Petersburg and the 2013 gold medal winner from the European Scientific-Industrial Chamber.
