The 2007 Jack Nicholson/Morgan Freeman film introduced the non-italicized non-capitalized term \u201cbucket list\u201d (a list of things one wants to do before one \"kicks the bucket\") into our vocabulary. Sure, it\u2019s often a punch line, but it\u2019s also a reminder one day we will die and before we do, will we have done enough extraordinary things to feel okay about it? (It is never, never, never enough.) This is a conception of a good life as a collection of Life tiles, the ones you\u2019d get at the end of the board game that said things like \u201cWrite the Great American Novel\u201d or \u201cSwim English Channel.\u201d\n\nAre those the moments that make us happy? Or can we find our joy in smaller, everyday moments? A study forthcoming from the Journal of Consumer Research says it depends on how old we are.\n\nMethodology: Researchers at Dartmouth College and the University of Pennsylvania first measured the happiness brought by extraordinary versus ordinary experiences simply by asking people. They had 221 participants aged 18 to 79 recall either an extraordinary or ordinary moment and rate how much it contributed to their happiness.\n\nOrdinary, happy experiences included things like \u201cI had a long and fun conversation with my son,\u201d and \u201cGetting a yummy frappuccino!\u201d Examples of extraordinary experiences from the study include \u201cWent on a vacation to Hawaii\u201d and \u201cWatching the birth of kittens.\u201d\n\nThey also had outsiders rate these experiences and how happy they would be if they had them. Other experiments checked the effects of sharing an experience with others, of how much time a person felt they had left to live, and of whether the person thought the experience was \u201cself-defining.\u201d One experiment also had participants rate whether the experience they most recently shared in a Facebook status was ordinary or extraordinary.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Extraordinary moments provide happiness throughout life, but as we realize our days our numbered, the small moments count for more.", "author": "Julie Beck", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Extraordinary moments provide happiness throughout life, but as we realize our days our numbered, the small moments count for more.", "title": "Study: Ordinary Experiences Make Us Happier as We Get Older", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/02/RTR24I2I/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/study-ordinary-experiences-make-us-happier-as-we-get-older/283763/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Methodology: Researchers at Dartmouth College and the University of Pennsylvania first measured the happiness brought by extraordinary versus ordinary experiences simply by asking people.\nThe 2007 Jack Nicholson/Morgan Freeman film introduced the non-italicized non-capitalized term \u201cbucket list\u201d (a list of things one wants to do before one \"kicks the bucket\") into our vocabulary.\nProblem: The problem is The Bucket List.\nOrdinary, happy experiences included things like \u201cI had a long and fun conversation with my son,\u201d and \u201cGetting a yummy frappuccino!\u201d Examples of extraordinary experiences from the study include \u201cWent on a vacation to Hawaii\u201d and \u201cWatching the birth of kittens.\u201dThey also had outsiders rate these experiences and how happy they would be if they had them.\nSure, it\u2019s often a punch line, but it\u2019s also a reminder one day we will die and before we do, will we have done enough extraordinary things to feel okay about it?"}
