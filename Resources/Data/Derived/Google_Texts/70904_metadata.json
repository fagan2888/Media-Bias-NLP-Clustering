More than 115 dentists, 50 hygienists and 250 dental assistants are expected to volunteer. Salina dentist Cindy Reed says volunteers get more out of the experience than they give. She says the patients are \"really thankful\" and that many have been suffering from dental pain.\n\nSince its first project in February 2003 in Garden City, the Kansas Mission of Mercy has provided nearly $13 million in dental care to more than 24,000 patients.\n\nThe events are known for attracting patients from hundreds of miles away. Some camp out so they can receive the free services.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Kansas Mission of Mercy clinic will be open Friday and Saturday at the Salina Bicentennial Center.", "language": "english", "author": "Associated Press", "og": {"url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Salina-prepares-for-free-two-day-dental-clinic-291211491.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/560*315/Dentist11.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The Kansas Mission of Mercy clinic will be open Friday and Saturday at the Salina Bicentennial Center.", "title": "Salina prepares for free two-day dental clinic"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "The Kansas Mission of Mercy clinic will be open Friday and Saturday at the Salina Bicentennial Center.", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Salina-prepares-for-free-two-day-dental-clinic-291211491.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Dentist11.jpg", "title": "Salina prepares for free two-day dental clinic", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Salina prepares for free two-day dental clinic", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Salina prepares for free twoday"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf095\"", "article_summary": "Volunteers are gearing up for a free two-day dental clinic in Salina.\nThe Salina Journal reports that the Kansas Mission of Mercy clinic will be open Friday and Saturday at the Salina Bicentennial Center.\nSince its first project in February 2003 in Garden City, the Kansas Mission of Mercy has provided nearly $13 million in dental care to more than 24,000 patients.\nShe says the patients are \"really thankful\" and that many have been suffering from dental pain.\nSalina dentist Cindy Reed says volunteers get more out of the experience than they give."}
