You can tell just how modular the book is by the way bits of it have been popping up all over the Web of late, promising to explain such mysteries as why so many handsome men are jerks or why an athlete\u2019s performance always seems to suffer a drop-off after he signs a big contract. This pull-apart quality may sound like a bug, but in fact it\u2019s a feature. It makes \u201cHow Not to Be Wrong\u201d a rewarding popular math book for just about anyone.\n\nEllenberg is a professor of mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who spent \u201csome part of my early 20s thinking I might want to be a Serious Literary Novelist.\u201d (He even published a novel, \u201cThe Grasshopper King.\u201d) He has a popular math column at Slate. So Ellenberg can write, and furthermore he brings a set of references to the subject that will make many a numbers-shy humanities major feel right at home. He explains why B.F. Skinner\u2019s \u201cproof\u201d that Shakespeare was not particularly inclined toward poetic alliteration was incorrect, and he is as likely to refer to Robert Frost and Thomas Pynchon as to such mathematical titans as R.A. Fisher and Francis Galton. He takes the playful, gentle, humorous tone of a writer used to cajoling his readers into believing that they can understand what he\u2019s talking about.\n\nAt the same time, those who like to pull out a pencil and a piece of paper and work through a few equations for the fun of it should not be utterly put off by the aforementioned cajoling. Interested in a brush-up on plane geometry, the implications of the Prime Numbers Theorem and Yitang Zhang\u2019s recently announced proof of the \u201cbounded gaps\u201d conjecture about the distribution of primes? Pull up a chair. On the other hand, if any sentence containing the term \u201clog N\u201d makes you go cross-eyed and befuddled, you need only turn a few pages ahead to another chapter, where you can read about how two separate math cartels gamed the Massachusetts state lottery.\n\nEllenberg\u2019s tone is by turns anecdotal and computational, but this book\u2019s most essential chapters have to do with probability and statistics, the spookier and more counterintuitive precincts of mathematical thinking pertaining to what might happen and how likely something is to be true. In an age of big data and slapdash science reporting, all of us need to be better skilled with these brain-twisting conceptual tools if we want to apply the proper skepticism to everything from drug company claims to mutual fund returns. In this respect, \u201cHow Not to Be Wrong\u201d resembles David J. Hand\u2019s \u201cThe Improbability Principle,\u201d published earlier this year. Hand\u2019s book is simpler and sometimes clearer, but it\u2019s also less expansive, creative and fun.\n\nEllenberg pauses, for example, to fantasize about going back in time to \u201cthe dawn of statistical nomenclature\u201d so he could persuade statisticians to use the term \u201cstatistically noticeable\u201d instead of \u201cstatistically significant.\u201d \u201cMathematics has a funny relationship to the English language,\u201d he writes, and here\u2019s a prime example. In statistics \u201csignificant\u201d does not indicate that a result is \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cmeaningful,\u201d only that it is at least a little bit off what we would expect from pure chance. Such a finding should be viewed as no more than \u201ca clue, suggesting a promising place to focus your research energy.\u201d Only when well-designed experiments consistently deliver the same finding can we start to treat it as a fact.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A poet-mathematician offers an empowering and entertaining primer for the age of Big Data", "author": "Laura Miller", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A poet-mathematician offers an empowering and entertaining primer for the age of Big Data", "title": "\u201cHow Not to Be Wrong\u201d: What the literary world can learn from math", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/08/how_not_to_be_wrong_what_the_literary_world_can_learn_from_math/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/how_not_to_be_wrong.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A poet-mathematician offers an empowering and entertaining primer for the age of Big Data", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/how_not_to_be_wrong.jpg", "title": "\u201cHow Not to Be Wrong\u201d: What the literary world can learn from math", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "\u201cHow Not to Be Wrong\u201d: What the literary world can learn from math", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Big Data, Books, Editor's Picks, jordan ellenberg, Mathematics, Must-Do, Probability, science journalism, Statistics, What to Read", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3a21\"", "article_summary": "It makes \u201cHow Not to Be Wrong\u201d a rewarding popular math book for just about anyone.\nIn this respect, \u201cHow Not to Be Wrong\u201d resembles David J.
