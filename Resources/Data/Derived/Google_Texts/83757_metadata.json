The court said two patents were an obvious variation of technology developed by CompuServe, and a third was deemed invalid on other obviousness grounds. The January ruling benefited dozens of companies sued by Soverain over the patents, including Oracle Corp., IBM Corp., EBay Inc., Best Buy Co., Bloomingdales Inc., J. Crew, Kohls, Macy\u2019s, Office Depot Inc., Radioshack, and Home Depot.\n\nSoverain should not get a second chance to argue the validity of the patents after the earlier ruling, the Federal Circuit wrote in this week\u2019s opinion.\n\nThe jury had awarded $8.7 million against Avon, and $9.2 million against Victoria\u2019s Secret at the trial in their case.\n\nThe case is Soverain LLC v. Victoria\u2019s Secret, 12-cv-1649, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington).\n\nPatents\n\nJ&J Down as Patent Ruling Raises Specter of Biosimilar Rival\n\nJohnson & Johnson shares fell on speculation that a ruling by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office would lead to biosimilar competition for best-selling drug Remicade in a matter of months.\n\nA J&J patent on the antibody used to create Remicade, which treats arthritis and reaps about $7 billion a year in sales, doesn\u2019t cover anything new from earlier patents, an examiner with the office said in a final rejection. New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J said it will respond to the decision within 60 days and pursue all available appeals.\n\nThe company can appeal the decision to a board within the agency and, if that doesn\u2019t work, to a court specializing in patent law. The patent remains valid during that process.\n\nThe decision may increase chances that a biological copy of Remicade, known as a biosimilar, could enter the market before 2018, when the patent expires. That would cause J&J\u2019s sales of the drug to stagnate, said Jami Rubin, an analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., in a research note. Shares of J&J fell as much as 3.2 percent after the patent office\u2019s ruling was reported earlier Thursday by IPD Analytics.\n\nCelltrion Inc. and Hospira Inc. have a biosimilar copy of Remicade that was approved by European regulators in 2013. It\u2019s common for patents to get rejected in re-examinations, and that doesn\u2019t mean the patent has been invalidated, Aude Gerspacher, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in a note.\n\nThe U.S. created a pathway to approve biosimilars as part of 2010\u2019s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and estimates by Rand Corp. say the cheaper drugs could save consumers $44 billion over the next decade.\n\nSilence Therapeutics Says European RNAi Patent Upheld in Appeal\n\nThe European Patent Office upheld a key RNA interference (RNAi) trigger modification patent against challenges by four parties, including Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc., its subsidiary Sirna Therapeutics. and Alcon Laboratories Inc., Silence Therapeutics Plc said in a statement.\n\nThe Board of Appeal, at an oral hearing, validated Silence\u2019s patent covering an alternating pattern of modified and unmodified nucleotides, Silence said in a statement.\n\nThis granted European patent \u201ccovers triggers of 15 to 23 base pairs with the modification pattern and covers one of the company\u2019s products already in clinical trial,\u201d Silence said in the statement.\n\nEquivalent patents have been granted to the company in the U.S., China, Israel, and other nations, according to the statement.\n\nFor more patent news, click here.\n\nTrademark\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Files Objection to Supermac\u2019s Trademark Registration\n\nMcDonald\u2019s Corp. filed a 41-page objection to European Union trademark registration by the Irish restaurant company Supermac\u2019s Ltd., Irish Central reported.\n\nThe Supermac\u2019s chain of over 100 restaurants, founded in 1978 by Pat McDonagh in County Galway, Ireland, seeks to expand into the U.K., the European Union and Australia.\n\nSimilarities between the name and menus of the two restaurant chains will cause confusion among consumers, fast-food giant McDonald\u2019s said in its filing, according to Irish Central.\n\n\u201cI am surprised by the points submitted by McDonald\u2019s in objection to our expansion into the EU,\u201d McDonagh said in a statement on the Supermac\u2019s website.\n\nSupermac\u2019s and McDonald\u2019s have grown and coexisted together in Ireland since 1978 \u201cas two very distinctive brands with immediately identifiable menus and a clear difference in ingredients and taste, and there has never been any confusion for our customers,\u201d McDonagh said in the statement.\n\nFor more trademark news, click here.\n\nCopyright\n\nPurring Kitten Flagged By YouTube as Infringing Music Copyright\n\nYouTube\u2019s software that functions as a roving bot seeking infringing music flagged a video of a purring kitten named Phantom, TorrentFreak reported.\n\nA 12-second loop of the kitty cat\u2019s purring caught the attention of the site\u2019s content identification system, which tagged it as belonging to EMI Publishing Ltd., according to TorrentFreak.\n\nYouTube informed the Digihaven channel, which had uploaded the video in March, that the Kitten\u2019s purring was infringing the copyright of a musical composition called \u201cFocus.\u201d Digihaven then filed a dispute to \u201creclaim\u201d the kitten\u2019s rights, according to TorrentFreak.\n\nThings seem to have worked out for Digihaven and its purring kitten.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s brought to our attention that a video or channel has been claimed mistakenly, we work with the claimant to fix it. Everything is now purrrfectly fine with this video,\u201d said Zayna Aston, a YouTube spokeswoman.\n\nThe video, which continues to be available, has garnered about 6,790 views, according to its YouTube channel late Thursday afternoon, where Digihaven posted, \u201cSubscribe and save the cats of YouTube.
