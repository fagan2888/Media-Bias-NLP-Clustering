This has the potential to be a very good idea for individual states. But it also appears to lack the qualities that made the concept such an effective mobilizing tool in 2009. The idea then was to include a federally powered plan in every state exchange. A robust public option would\u2019ve reduced costs significantly, and may have even swallowed private insurance markets, putting the country on a predictable path to national health care, while avoiding the maximal disruption that legislating Medicare-for-all outright would create.\n\nCreating a public option in California could be a great advent. But it wouldn\u2019t do anything directly to reform insurance in Texas. The hope may be that a handful of states experiment successfully with public options, and create models other states will follow in the future. A positive development!
