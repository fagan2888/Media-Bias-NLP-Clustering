(Merck via AP)\n\nSince 2009, the state has provided 30,000 contraceptive implants or intrauterine devices (IUDs) at low or no cost to low-income women at 68 family-planning clinics across Colorado through the Colorado Family Planning Initiative. The effort was funded by a five-year commitment of $23 million from an anonymous donor.\n\nAt participating clinics, the percentage of young women receiving IUDs or implants quadrupled, according to a press release from Gov. John Hickenlooper (D).\n\nThe state attributes three-quarters of the overall decline in the Colorado teen birthrate to the program and said its success had a ripple effect.\n\nWith fewer unplanned pregnancies, the teen abortion rate fell by 35 percent between 2009 and 2012 in those counties where the initiative is in place.\n\nThe state also spent less on food programs for low-income mothers and children; infant enrollment in WIC supplemental nutrition program declined 23 percent between 2008 and 2013.\n\nThe governor\u2019s office said the state saved $42.5 million in health-care expenditures associated with teen births.\n\nFor every dollar spent on the contraceptives, the state saved $5.68 in Medicaid costs, according to the Denver Post.\n\nLiz Romer, a family-planning nurse at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado, told the BBC an IUD normally costs between $500 and several thousand dollars. She said that\u2019s cost prohibitive to teens who don\u2019t have the money themselves and feel they can\u2019t ask their parents to pay. \u201cIt needs to be readily available, the same day, and it needs to be free,\u201d she said.\n\nBut conservative religious groups disagree.\n\nCarrie Gordon Earll, senior director of public policy for the conservative Christian ministry Focus on the Family, told the Denver Post she was skeptical of the state\u2019s claim that increased access to contraception caused the decline in birthrates. \u201cWhat we have seen over many years is that access to contraception does not equal fewer unintended pregnancies and fewer abortions,\u201d Earll said. \u201cAvailability of contraception leads to increased sexual activity, which leads to unintended pregnancies and abortions.\u201d\n\nBob Enyart, a spokesman for Colorado Right to Life, told the BBC offering contraception to teens sends the message that you can \u201chave all the sex you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you teach children that they\u2019re animals \u2014 that they have evolved from pigs and dogs and apes \u2014 then they act like animals,\u201d Enyart said.\n\nDainzu Mosqueda Salinas works for the Boulder Valley Women\u2019s Health Center. She came to the clinic in 2010 as a teenager to get contraception. \u201cOne of my friends from school had an unplanned pregnancy, and at the time I was studying and was not looking to be pregnant,\u201d Salinas told the BBC.\n\nColorado\u2019s success is encouraging, but not every state has an anonymous millionaire willing to fund such a campaign. It\u2019s not clear yet what will happen to Colorado\u2019s program when the fortuitous funding stream runs out in 2015. However, a Colorado public health department spokesman told CNN the initiative is a useful model for family-planning coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cBy showing the effectiveness of long-acting, reversible contraceptives, we\u2019re providing the evidence needed for health plans \u2026 to cover family planning services,\u201d the spokesman said.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this piece misspelled the name of Dainzu Mosqueda Salinas.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An anonymous donor spent $23 million on an IUD program for young women.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "An anonymous donor spent $23 million on an IUD program for young women.", "title": "How Colorado\u2019s teen birthrate dropped 40% in four years", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/12/how-colorados-teen-birthrate-dropped-40-in-four-years/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2014/08/AP566054003637.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@g_forcewinds"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/08/12/how-colorados-teen-birthrate-dropped-40-in-four-years/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "iud, contraception, colorado, colorado birth rate", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "iud, contraception, colorado, colorado birth rate"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce907\"", "article_summary": "The state attributes three-quarters of the overall decline in the Colorado teen birthrate to the program and said its success had a ripple effect.\nLiz Romer, a family-planning nurse at Children\u2019s Hospital Colorado, told the BBC an IUD normally costs between $500 and several thousand dollars.\nColorado\u2019s teen birth rate plummeted 40 percent between 2009 and 2013.\nHowever, a Colorado public health department spokesman told CNN the initiative is a useful model for family-planning coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cOne of my friends from school had an unplanned pregnancy, and at the time I was studying and was not looking to be pregnant,\u201d Salinas told the BBC."}
