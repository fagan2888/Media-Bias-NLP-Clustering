But a neuropsychologist at Loyal University Medical Center is skeptical about the proof and questioning whether CTE even exists.\n\n\u201cThere has not yet been one controlled epidemiological study looking at the risk of late-life cognitive impairment in any collision sport, including boxing, American football, or other sports involving repetitive head trauma,\u201d Randolph argued in the journal, Current Sports Medicine Reports.\n\nCTE is often associated with behavioral changes marked by anger, aggression, and suicidal tendencies while cognitive impairments, such as learning and memory difficulties, are also common. Randolph took issue with the premise of several studies that looked at CTE. One in particular, published in Brain, identified suicidal tendencies as a key feature of CTE and reported detecting the disease in 97 percent of the brains of the retired NFL players they analyzed. Randolph countered that the mortality rate of retired NFL players is half that of men their age in the United States while suicide rates are 60 percent less than the national average for men. \u201c[T]he recently published data on cause of death in NFL retirees do not support the probability of a markedly elevated risk,\u201d he concluded.\n\nWith regard to the same Brain study, Randolph also differed with the authors\u2019 decision to define CTE based on the presence of an abnormal type of protein, called tau, which is often implicated in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This form of tau, he argues, isn\u2019t unique to diseases like CTE, while its presence doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate either that damage to nerves in the brain is occurring or that a person will suffer from cognitive and behavioral changes.\n\n\u201cOverall,\u201d he concluded, \u201calthough retired NFL players have been the focus of more attention into the potential late-life neurological consequences of repetitive head trauma than athletes in any other sport, the risks for these retirees remains largely hypothetical.\u201d He added that the broad list of symptoms that are associated with CTE is too broad to be considered at all meaningful in diagnosing this clinical syndrome. He listed CTE symptoms that ranged from paranoia to memory loss, language impairment to apathy, commenting that \u201cthey encompass a range of symptoms from those that are common in the normal healthy population to those observed in a variety of neurological diseases.\u201d\n\nThe purpose of refuting many influential CTE studies, Randolph explained, is not to completely dismiss the notion that the disease even exists but, rather, to point out that the current apprehension about the NFL \u2014 and other sports \u2014 is based on flimsy proof. Furthermore, he added, \u201cthis type of information may lead individuals experiencing depression to misinterpret their symptoms as indicative of the first stages of a fatal neurodegenerative disorder.\u201d\n\nRandolph called for stronger epidemiological studies that have large samples of ex-NFL players who are compared with age-matched, non-football playing counterparts \u201cwithout a history of involvement in collision sports.\u201d If there proved to be an increased risk from playing in the NFL, he suggested following retired players over time and using imaging to detect any changes that indicate neuropathology.\n\nRecently, the NFL partnered with the National Institutes of Health to support research into how brain changes can occur after traumatic head injury and multiple concussions.\n\nSource: Randolph C.
