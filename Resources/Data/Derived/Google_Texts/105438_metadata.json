Scott Brown will officially kick off his campaign to unseat New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen tonight, as he attempts to return to the world's greatest deliberative body (or something) after being ousted from his Bay State Senate seat by Democrat Elizabeth Warren two years ago. According to leaked excerpts of the speech he plans to deliver tonight, Brown will be campaigning against Obamacare, just as he did in 2010 when he won an upset in the race to succeed the late Sen. Edward Kennedy.\n\n\"Along with our money and our health plans, for a lot of us, it feels like we're losing our liberty, too. Obamacare forces us to make a choice, live free or log on \u2014 and here in New Hampshire, we choose freedom,\" Brown plans to say. (Get it? Because New Hampshire's state motto is \"live free or die.\" But wait, if Obamacare is the major assault on freedom Republicans claim it is, do you have the choice to live free under it? Or is it just that \"log on or die\" didn't send the right message? But I digress.)\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on the Republican Party.]\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's definitely a danger for Brown in taking this approach. Yes, the health care law has, according to a recent WMUR Granite State poll, a less than stellar approval rating in New Hampshire, with only 34 percent saying they approve of it while 53 percent say they oppose it. ( Let's add the caveat that the poll doesn't say what portion of the opposition thinks the law goes too far and what portion thinks it doesn't go far enough.) But Brown will have a hard time getting around the various problems other Republicans are running into when it comes to making Obamacare a focal point of a campaign.\n\nFor starters, the law may be unpopular in theory, but in practice, signups under Obamacare's New Hampshire exchange have exceeded expectations. Does Brown have a plan for providing for those folks? Or how about the estimated 50,000 people who are going to receive health insurance under New Hampshire's recently approved Medicaid expansion, which was made possible by Obamacare and on which Brown has thus far been mum? Those are real people who are experiencing real benefits from the law.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem for Republicans, which Brown is eventually going to run into as well: Providing the benefits of Obamacare requires something that looks like Obamacare. Just look at this quote a Republican aide gave to Talking Points Memo's Sahil Kapur (emphasis added):\n\n\n\nAs far as repeal and replace goes, the problem with replace is that if you really want people to have these new benefits, it looks a hell of a lot like the Affordable Care Act. ... To make something like that work, you have to move in the direction of the ACA. You have to have a participating mechanism, you have to have a mechanism to fund it, you have to have a mechanism to fix parts of the market.\n\n\n\nAnd Brown knew this once upon a time. As my former colleague Igor Volsky noted, as a state senator Brown voted for the Massachusetts health reform law that looks a whole lot like Obamacare.\n\n[See a collection of political cartoons on Obamacare.]\n\nThis is exactly why the long awaited Republican health care alternative never actually comes to fruition. (Sure, some individual lawmakers have proposed plans, but the party hasn't coalesced around one bill.) To actually craft an alternative, the GOP would either have to admit that Obamacare is a pretty darn conservative measure or admit, like House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan did the other day, that the popular provisions and benefits of Obamacare have to go away as well in order to enact a more Republican-y plan.\n\n\n\nWill that latter approach work in still quite blue New Hampshire? Or will Brown try to get away with hand waving about an Obamacare alternative that will never materialize? Either way, spouting \"live free or log on\" will be no slam dunk.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Scott Brown Already Has an Obamacare Problem in New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Scott Brown's campaign is going to fall into a health care trap.", "title": "Stuck Between Obamacare and a Hard Place", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/pat-garofalo/2014/04/10/scott-brown-already-has-an-obamacare-problem-in-new-hampshire", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/01/6f/dbe885894b4c862f36073070addd/140314-brown-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Scott Brown's campaign is going to fall into a health care trap.", "card": "summary", "title": "Scott Brown Already Has an Obamacare Problem in New Hampshire"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "April 10, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Pat Garofalo,New Hampshire,Brown, Scott,2014 Congressional elections,Senate,Shaheen, Jeanne,health care,health care reform,health insurance,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Scott Brown's campaign is going to fall into a health care trap."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a19\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare forces us to make a choice, live free or log on \u2014 and here in New Hampshire, we choose freedom,\" Brown plans to say.\n\"Along with our money and our health plans, for a lot of us, it feels like we're losing our liberty, too.\nAnd therein lies the problem for Republicans, which Brown is eventually going to run into as well: Providing the benefits of Obamacare requires something that looks like Obamacare.\nBut wait, if Obamacare is the major assault on freedom Republicans claim it is, do you have the choice to live free under it?\nEither way, spouting \"live free or log on\" will be no slam dunk."}
