The Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research crunched the numbers for February and found that women gained 55,000 jobs in professional and business services, another 24,000 jobs in education and health services, and 14,000 jobs in leisure and hospitality. (The above IWPR chart shows the year-over-year gains for women\u2019s employment.)\n\nMeanwhile, longer-term trends show that women\u2019s share of employment gains is flattening out at about 50% \u2014 a reasonable level given that women represent almost half of the workforce, according to government data. Over the 12 months through February, women\u2019s nonfarm employment rose by 1.07 million jobs, half of the total U.S. gain of 2.16 million. A couple of years ago, women accounted for just 37% of annual job gains.\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? During the \u201checession,\u201d also less-rhymingly known as the \u201cmancession,\u201d men lost the lion\u2019s share of jobs, flooding the labor market with unemployed workers looking for a new spot. So it makes sense that earlier in the recovery, they made up a larger share of employment growth, said Katherine Gallagher Robbins, a policy analyst at the National Women\u2019s Law Center.\n\nNow that the U.S. is past the recovery\u2019s earliest stages, women are gaining about half the jobs.\n\n\u201cIt shows a normalization of the job market,\u201d Gallagher Robbins said.\n\n\u2013Ruth Mantell\n\nFollow Ruth on Twitter @RuthMantell.\n\nFollow the Capitol Report blog on Twitter @CapitolReport.\n\nCheck out these Capitol Report posts:\n\nThe jury is still out on Obamacare\u2019s impact on the jobs market\n\nIn one chart, everything you need to know about February\u2019s jobs report", "article_metadata": {"article.author": "MarketWatch", "description": "More than half of the economy\u2019s new jobs went to women last month, led by services, leisure and hospitality employers, according to government data released Friday.", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "article.page": "Capitol Report Blog", "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "More than half of the economy\u2019s new jobs went to women last month, led by services, leisure and hospitality employers, according to government data released Friday.", "title": "Here\u2019s why women nabbed more than half of new jobs last month", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/03/07/heres-why-women-nabbed-more-than-half-of-new-jobs-last-month/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DR328_mw_soc_NS_20150801233302.png", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "More than half of the economy\u2019s new jobs went to women last month, led by services, leisure and hospitality employers, according to government data released Friday.", "title": "Here\u2019s why women nabbed more than half of new jobs last month", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/03/07/heres-why-women-nabbed-more-than-half-of-new-jobs-last-month/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DR328_mw_soc_NS_20150801233302.png"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.published": "2014-03-07T13:55:07-05:00", "article.access": "free", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "article.type": "Capitol Report", "article.id": "BL-MWEB-5470", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/capitolreport/2014/03/07/heres-why-women-nabbed-more-than-half-of-new-jobs-last-month/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article.created": "2014-03-07T13:55:07-05:00", "article.updated": "2014-03-07T13:55:07-05:00", "keywords": "jobs,women", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "article.section": "Blogs", "article.headline": "Here\u2019s why women nabbed more than half of new jobs last month", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "news_keywords": "jobs,women"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8b84\"", "article_summary": "More than half of the economy\u2019s new jobs went to women last month, led by services, leisure and hospitality employers, according to government data released Friday.\nCheck out these Capitol Report posts:The jury is still out on Obamacare\u2019s impact on the jobs marketIn one chart, everything you need to know about February\u2019s jobs report\nOver the 12 months through February, women\u2019s nonfarm employment rose by 1.07 million jobs, half of the total U.S. gain of 2.16 million.\nNow that the U.S. is past the recovery\u2019s earliest stages, women are gaining about half the jobs.\n(The above IWPR chart shows the year-over-year gains for women\u2019s employment.)"}
