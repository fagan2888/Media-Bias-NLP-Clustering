It was, to say the least, an unexpected move. Varoufakis had indeed pledged to resign -- but only if the vote went the other way.\n\nThe news was no doubt greeted with pleasure by a number of Varoufakis\u2019s former counterparts in the Eurogroup, which is made up of the finance ministers of the European countries that have adopted the euro as a common currency. Varoufakis\u2019s\u2019 brash personal style \u2013 arriving for meetings via motorcycle, branding other Eurogroup officials \u201cterrorists\u201d \u2013 did not win him many fans in Brussels.\n\nRelated: Greece \u2013 What You Need to Know After the \u2018No\u2019 Vote\n\nHowever, whatever celebrating is taking place in the offices of some of Varoufakis\u2019s main antagonists, including Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem of the Netherlands and German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schauble, is likely tinged with uncertainty about his successor.\n\nIt became clear Monday morning that Varoufakis was pushed out by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in the hope that by removing him it might change the tone in meetings with Greece\u2019s creditors. However, it isn\u2019t at all clear that his successor, Euclid Tsakalotos, will be seen as a breath of fresh air.\n\nFor one thing, Tsakalotos, formerly the government\u2019s Alternate Foreign Minister for International Economic Relations, has already played a major role in the negotiations that have thus far failed. A professor of economics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Tsakalotos was named chief bailout negotiator in the spring, seen at the time as a means of insulating the other members of the Eurogroup from Varoufakis.\n\nBut while Tsakalotos, a career academic, may be more soft-spoken than Varoufakis, it\u2019s not at all clear that his policies will be substantially different. Described variously as a leftist and a Marxist, Tsakalotos inhabits the left wing of Greece\u2019s already-left-wing government.\n\nRelated: Greece\u2019s Surprise \u2018No\u2019 Vote a Big Defeat for Europe\n\nBorn in Rotterdam, Tsakalotos spent most of his life not in Greece but in England, where he attended the exclusive prep school St. Paul\u2019s in London before moving on to Oxford, where he ultimately received a Ph.D. in economics. Though a member of the Greek parliament and a senior figure within the Syriza Party, Tsakalotos\u2019 Greek carries a perceptible English accent.\n\nHis pan-European background, however, does not herald a greater willingness to bend to the demands of Greece\u2019s creditors than Varoufakis demonstrated. In fact, while Varoufakis was an early and ardent supporter of the European Union project, Tsakalotos was more skeptical. (He has said that his preference now is for Greece to remain in the eurozone.)\n\nTsakalotos\u2019s personal opinion of the origins of the Greek crisis flies in the face of the conventional wisdom of the country\u2019s creditors, who claim that an outsized central government, excessively tight labor laws, and too much government borrowing combined to turn the Greek economy into an invalid that could only be cured through that forceful application of austerity measures.\n\nNot so, said Tsakalotos in Crucible of Resistance: Greece, the Eurozone & the World Economic Crisis, a 2012 book he co-authored. The narrative in which Greece is an \u201cexceptional\u201d case in Europe that must be brought into line is \u201ca version of [German Chancellor] Angela Merkel\u2019s Calvinist fable, in which the unrighteous need to be punished for their past failings \u2013 both for their own good and \u2018pour encourager les autres.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated: EU Opponents Delight in Greek \u2018No\u2019 Vote\n\nTsakalotos sharply disagrees with what he calls \u201can exercise in creating collective guilt\u201d and argues instead that Greece\u2019s problems stem not from being too little like the economically liberal countries currently demanding austerity, but in trying to become too much like them.\n\nSome in the media are suggesting that Tsakalotos\u2019 long history with the Syriza Party is part of the reason why he has been brought in, the idea being that he will be better able to sell a package of sharper austerity measures to the party\u2019s voters than Varoufakis would have been.\n\nHowever, unless Tsakalotos has changed his mind about the relevance of a \u201cCalvinist fable\u201d to the current crisis, members of the Eurogroup may simply find themselves sitting across the table from a slightly more polite and decidedly less flashy version of Yanis Varoufakis.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On the heels of an overwhelming vote by the Greek people to reject its creditors\u2019 dema", "title": "Greece\u2019s New Marxist Finance Minister: More Polished, More Radical?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/06/Greece-s-New-Marxist-Finance-Minister-More-Polished-More-Radical", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cbusiness-us-eurozone-greece-poll_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/07/06/Greece-s-New-Marxist-Finance-Minister-More-Polished-More-Radical", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/cbusiness-us-eurozone-greece-poll_1.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "On the heels of an overwhelming vote by the Greek people to reject its creditors\u2019 dema", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "His pan-European background, however, does not herald a greater willingness to bend to the demands of Greece\u2019s creditors than Varoufakis demonstrated.\nThough a member of the Greek parliament and a senior figure within the Syriza Party, Tsakalotos\u2019 Greek carries a perceptible English accent.\nDescribed variously as a leftist and a Marxist, Tsakalotos inhabits the left wing of Greece\u2019s already-left-wing government.\nIt became clear Monday morning that Varoufakis was pushed out by Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras in the hope that by removing him it might change the tone in meetings with Greece\u2019s creditors.\nNot so, said Tsakalotos in Crucible of Resistance: Greece, the Eurozone & the World Economic Crisis, a 2012 book he co-authored."}
