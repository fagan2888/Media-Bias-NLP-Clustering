Now dozens of Oklahomans are headed west to help.\n\nEarly Thursday morning, OG&E trucks filled up at a gas station on S.E. 44th and Interstate 35 in Oklahoma City.\n\nAt 6 a.m. dozens of OG&E linemen left Oklahoma City to provide aid to Xcel Energy in Colorado. The CBS affiliate in Denver is reporting at one point, 290,000 people were without power after the blizzard struck that area. At last check, more than 51,000 people were still in the dark.\n\nSeventy-five OG&E linemen, along with 75 contractors will make the drive to Colorado to help restore those lines. We asked OG&E about staffing here in Oklahoma should we have any power issues while these crews are gone. We were told OG&E never sends more than they can afford to lose, and of course if we were to have any power issues in Oklahoma, these crews would be called back.\n\nNews 9 learned that the call for mutual aid was place about 72 hours before that blizzard struck.\n\nOG&E crews will be joined by crews from Texas, Kansas and New Mexico.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Hundreds of thousands are without power in Colorado after this week's big blizzard.
