Craig Bohannon, a 50-year-old Bernie Sanders supporter, took issue with the candidate referring to the Affordable Care Act by its colloquial name.\n\n\"It was rewritten by Congress,\" Bohannon shouted, according to CNN. \"Not by the president! By Congress!\"\n\nThe Texas senator continued his stump speech, but was again interrupted by Bohannon. When Cruz began to speak about Obamacare a second time, Bohannon\u2019s heckling grew louder. A Cruz supporter \u2012 identified only as Don \u2012 lost his patience and confronted Bohannon, and the two men stood at each other\u2019s faces.\n\n\"I need a cop here,\" yelled Bohannon, who had large gauged earlobes and black painted fingernails, according to CNN. \"I need a cop. I want to file charges!\"\n\nAn officer was escorting both men out of the rally when a scuffle broke out between the two. Bohannon raised his fist in triumph, causing Don, who wore a stars-and-stripes hat and a white horseshoe mustache, to grab him by the throat.\n\n\"I want charges pressed against this man. So we can put him in handcuffs and stick him in the back of the car,\u201d Bohannon said with a hoarse voice, CNN reported.\n\nRead more\n\nDon, 66, leaned against the patrol car while being questioned by the officer, still holding a Cruz campaign sign. He gently placed his hand on the deputy\u2019s chest as if to demonstrate how gently he treated Bohannon, who he said was being too loud.\n\n\n\n\"This guy's screaming in my ear, and I couldn't hear anything,\" he said, according to CNN.\n\nNye County Sheriff's Deputy Travis Buffi said that he was going to send the case to the district attorney's office and recommend a charge of misdemeanor battery.\n\n\"I didn't do anything to be arrested,\" Don said, according to CNN. \"If I was gonna hurt the guy, he was gonna be hurt.\"\n\nBohannon told CNN he used to be a groundskeeper in California before exposure to toxic chemicals left him with chronic nerve damage; he has been living off of disability ever since.\n\nBohannon made a Facebook post three nights earlier, indicating that he was raring for confrontation at the rally.\n\n\"Sunday Ted Cruz will be making the mistake of visiting Pahrump and giving me a ticket to come see him!!! Maybe this time I can get ejected!!!\" he wrote.\n\nWhile he was loud and clear about his distaste for Ted Cruz and support for Obamacare, he is not a Democratic partisan.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are stuck. We are stagnant,\u201d Bohannon told RT. \u201cI would like to see [the president] be either Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Bernie Sanders supporter was removed from a Ted Cruz rally in Nevada, after heckling the Texas Senator aspiring to the Republican presidential nomination and getting into a scuffle with his sympathizers.", "og": {"site_name": "RT International", "description": "A Bernie Sanders supporter was removed from a Ted Cruz rally in Nevada, after heckling the Texas Senator aspiring to the Republican presidential nomination and getting into a scuffle with his sympathizers.", "title": "Sanders supporter removed from Ted Cruz rally after heckling candidate", "locale": "en_EN", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/2016.02/article/56cb86efc36188d6268b45c8.jpg", "url": "https://www.rt.com/usa/333302-sanders-supporter-cruz-rally/", "type": "article"}, "navigation": "tabbed", "twitter": {"description": "A Bernie Sanders supporter was removed from a Ted Cruz rally in Nevada, after heckling the Texas Senator aspiring to the Republican presidential nomination and getting into a scuffle with his sympathizers.", "title": "RT International", "image": "https://img.rt.com/files/2016.02/article/56cb86efc36188d6268b45c8.jpg", "creator": "@RT_com", "site": "@RT_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "msvalidate.01": "36879475773792950F4872586A371571", "google-site-verification": "VQLbsaWKiXW2-Vt4lP7MevnhMES537NO4fQjfGgLcbI", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "MobileOptimzied": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "A Bernie Sanders supporter was removed from a Ted Cruz rally in Nevada, after heckling the Texas Senator aspiring to the Republican presidential nomination and getting into a scuffle with his sympathizers.\n\"Sunday Ted Cruz will be making the mistake of visiting Pahrump and giving me a ticket to come see him!!!\nCraig Bohannon, a 50-year-old Bernie Sanders supporter, took issue with the candidate referring to the Affordable Care Act by its colloquial name.\nWhile he was loud and clear about his distaste for Ted Cruz and support for Obamacare, he is not a Democratic partisan.\nA Cruz supporter \u2012 identified only as Don \u2012 lost his patience and confronted Bohannon, and the two men stood at each other\u2019s faces."}
