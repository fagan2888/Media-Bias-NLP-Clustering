The minister and his second wife, Judith Sargent Murray, had even stopped to dine with the Washingtons on their way to the Convention. Thanks in large part to their efforts, universal salvation was no longer an obscure creed espoused by a scattered few. Now the Convention sought to establish Universalism as a recognized, socially responsible faith.\n\nWashington responded favorably. \u201cGENTLEMEN,\u201d he began, thanking them for their well-wishes, \u201cIt gives me the most sensible pleasure to find, that in our nation, however different are the sentiments of citizens on religious doctrines, they generally concur in one thing: for their political professions and practices, are almost universally friendly to the order and happiness of our civil institutions. I am also happy in finding this disposition particularly evinced by your society.\u201d Such affirmation of the Universalists\u2019 civic friendliness, from none other than the first president of the newly United States, must have gratified the Convention. They were well aware that other Protestant clergy, especially the Calvinists, disdained their \u201cpeculiar doctrine.\u201d\n\nOne of Universalism\u2019s harshest critics was a Presbyterian minister also named John Murray and close in age to the other. To distinguish the two, their followers dubbed the Universalist \u201cSalvation\u201d Murray and the Presbyterian \u201cDamnation\u201d Murray. While \u201cSalvation\u201d preached the eventual redemption of all humanity, \u201cDamnation\u201d treated congregants and readers to vivid depictions of a hell gaping wide for sinners of every stripe. Universalism, he argued, offered license to sin without fear of consequences and undermined the justice of God by making Him a weak and ineffective ruler. \u201cSalvation\u201d and Judith Sargent Murray, for their part, believed that the promise of heaven for all presented a more perfect and rational view of God as loving and merciful rather than vengeful and arbitrary. Such a God, they hoped, would do more to inspire virtue and good works in the new nation\u2019s citizens than a tyrannical deity who could arbitrarily condemn a significant part of His creation to eternal perdition.\n\nThe controversy over the justness and necessity of eternal hell took off in the aftermath of the revivals that swept New England and spread through the colonies in the mid-eighteenth century. Out of these revivals came intense debates over predestination, human nature, and the character of God, which dovetailed into the arguments over damnation. These debates did not stay hermetically sealed within a vacuum of theological speculation but traveled into the social and political realms as Americans worried about the success of their national experiment. In a new republican society, where disinterested virtue seemed the only check on unbridled power and tyranny, the choice to reject or retain belief in eternal damnation was much more than an arcane doctrinal dispute. Universalists and their opponents alike suggested that their beliefs represented not only the safest religious faith for the individual but also the best moral glue for the new nation.\n\nEach group, in attacking the other, defined itself further. Those who rejected damnation had to explain how the promise of heaven for all would promote morality in the here-and-now. And attacks on Calvinism by Universalists and others new to the scene, including the early Methodists, prompted some Calvinist theologians to defend their traditional faith by reshaping it for a new era. In so doing, they helped to revitalize the idea of damnation for a new generation and ensure that Universalism would remain marginalized through the antebellum years. But in the early decades of the republic, Universalism seemed poised to blossom beyond the hopes and fears of damnation\u2019s detractors and defenders alike.\n\nAwakening Controversies\n\nThe religious ferment precipitated by the New England awakenings that had begun in the 1730s did not go uncontested and formed the essential backdrop to the Universalist controversy. Supporters of the revivals, including Jonathan Edwards and his followers, found themselves defending the legitimacy of the passionate religious experiences they had inspired, the necessity of spiritual rebirth for salvation, and the continued validity of the Calvinist doctrine of predestination. Predestination did not square easily with revivals: if God had already determined who would be saved, what could revivals do but instill anxiety and despair in those who lacked the ability to repent and be reborn? Meanwhile, English intellectuals across the Atlantic had been questioning the justness of hell since the seventeenth century. They mostly wrote for each other, worried about the possible consequences of letting their ideas reach the masses. But educated Americans like Edwards were aware of their doubts and arguments.\n\nEdwards warned that \u201cthe very principal reason of such thoughts arising in the mind is a want of a sense of the horrible evil of sin.\u201d All were born wicked after Adam\u2019s fall, and God was justified in letting any individual plunge into the \u201cbottomless gulf\u201d of hell without forewarning. But this did not mean that humans had no agency and therefore no responsibility for their fates. Instead, said Edwards, all sinners had a natural ability to repent, since nothing physical or external, like pain or paralysis, hindered their doing so (at least in a Christian society). Individuals had no excuse for the depravity of their hearts and their warped wills. It was their duty to heed God\u2019s call, especially in a revival setting where everything was calculated to facilitate a change of heart and nothing but their own intransigence and moral failure prevented them from doing so.\n\nWhile defending the natural freedom of the will, Edwards also reaffirmed predestination and God\u2019s ultimate, even inscrutable, sovereignty. Although all sinners had a duty to repent and hence escape the terrors of hell, God only elected certain people, for reasons unknown, to receive a new spiritual sense. This godly infusion enabled the elect to direct their warped moral inclinations toward repentance, rebirth, and love for \u201cBeing in general.\u201d The damned were so not by external factors but by their own fallen free wills, which God had not chosen to redeem.\n\nBelieving that humans had the physical if not the moral ability to repent and be saved, Edwards and his fellow revivalists exhorted them with fire and brimstone discourses like the infamous 1741 \u201cSinners in the Hands of an Angry God.\u201d After the initial revival in Northampton had subsided following the suicide of Edwards\u2019s uncle, Joseph Hawley (who was convinced that he was damned), Edwards had realized that \u201chell, in all its fury and torture, would have to be enlisted if heaven were ever to be gained.\u201d He had an \u201cexplicitly\u2014at times excruciatingly\u2014physical conception of hell\u2019s torments,\u201d drawing from observations of nature. His \u201cSinners\u201d sermon compared fallen humanity, in the eyes of God, to a \u201cspider, or some loathsome insect,\u201d suspended by God\u2019s mercy \u201cover the fire.\u201d Edwards ended the sermon with a powerful altar call:\n\nAnd now you have an extraordinary Opportunity, a Day wherein Christ has flung the Door of Mercy wide open, and stands in the Door calling and crying with a loud Voice to poor Sinners . . . . Many that were very lately in the same miserable Condition that you are in, are in now an happy State, with their Hearts filled with love . . . . How awful is it to be left behind at such a Day! To see so many others feasting, while you are pining and perishing! . . . How can you rest one Moment in such a Condition?\n\nThe sermon provoked intense physical and emotional reactions. One congregant observed that \u201cthere was a great moaning and crying out throughout the whole house.\u201d Similar ecstasies and terrors were reported throughout New England in the early 1740s and in other regions where the revivals spread.\n\nCalvinist opponents of the revivals, including the Congregationalist \u201cOld Lights\u201d led by Boston minister Charles Chauncy and the Presbyterian \u201cOld Side,\u201d believed that the intense experiences such sermons produced were at best mere enthusiasm and at worst the work of the devil playing on the minds of the overwrought and excitable masses. They were particularly alarmed by the license such enthusiastic experiences seemed to give laypeople to criticize staid ministers as \u201cspiritually dead.\u201d They saw the attempts of Edwards and his followers to square predestination with free agency as impenetrable and unconvincing metaphysical speculation. These opponents believed that revivals, where sinners were suddenly convicted of their depravity and impending damnation to the point of fainting and crying, would not result in true rebirth. They held that real conversions should and would come about through membership in the church community and diligent use of the traditional means appointed for the reception of saving grace: prayer, Bible study, attendance at services, and Holy Communion. Ultimate salvation required a life of obedience and not just sudden rebirth produced by terror. Through such gradual means and holy living the elect would come to know of their election, while those who were not elect would at least conform to the external ordinances of Christian behavior.\n\nThese anti-revivalists were not uniform in their opposition. Some saw themselves as conservatives shoring up the traditional faith of their Puritan forbears against the novelty and disruption of Edwardsean revivalism; others veered in a more liberal direction, repudiating attempts to create a \u201cconsistent Calvinism\u201d that would square free will with the sovereignty of God. The more these increasingly liberal ministers emphasized the church as the means of saving grace, the less they hewed to the doctrine of predestination. They stressed the importance of moral living over a change of heart. They also emphasized the ethical example of Christ rather than the traditional Calvinist doctrine that Christ\u2019s death on the cross saved the elect alone. Some of these theologians and ministers, receptive to the encroachments of Enlightenment rationality and optimism on the Calvinist tenets of original sin and partial election, formed the vanguard of American Unitarianism. Even Chauncy himself would turn to universal salvation by the 1780s, though he published his defenses of the doctrine anonymously, testament to the incendiary nature of rejecting damnation in the early republic.\n\nThe \u201cInsanities\u201d of Calvin and Hopkins\n\nBy the second half of the eighteenth century, then, the Calvinist idea that damnation resulted from inherent and inherited depravity and from God\u2019s selection of only a few for salvation was coming under attack from within. At the same time, external threats to the doctrine of predestination were filtering into the colonies from religious movements with overseas roots, like Universalism. Methodists were also beginning to make incursions, doing away with unconditional election in favor of emphasizing free will and ability to strive for salvation (a theological position known as Arminianism). Not all early Americans were Calvinists, but Calvinism was the dominant theological tradition against which most other groups defined themselves and which received the most fire from freethinkers in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. They accused Calvinism of painting God as an arbitrary dictator who randomly chose whom to save and whom to damn. No less than Thomas Jefferson decried Calvin as \u201cindeed an Atheist . . . or rather his religion was Daemonism . . . . It would be more pardonable to believe in no god at all, than to blaspheme him by the atrocious attributes of Calvin.\u201d Likening an American theologian, Samuel Hopkins, to Calvin, Jefferson wrote that both propounded \u201cinsanities . . . . The straight jacket alone was their proper remedy.\u201d\n\nThis Samuel Hopkins was famed (and reviled) for his declaration that sinners should be willing to be damned for the glory of God. A New England native, Hopkins considered himself the direct heir to Jonathan Edwards and likewise sought to defend the consistency of Calvinism against external and internal onslaughts. Hopkins wrote his major works after Edwards\u2019s death in 1758, as the excitement generated by the revivals continued to spin out in theological debates. His own conversion had occurred in the midst of the awakenings in New England while he was a student at Yale in the late 1730s and early 1740s. His classmate David Brainerd, later a missionary to the Native Americans, was keen on ascertaining Hopkins\u2019s spiritual state. Although Hopkins initially resisted, Brainerd soon succeeded in frightening him out of his apathy. After weeks of agony and guilt, Hopkins \u201chad a sense of the being and presence of God, as I never had before . . . . I was greatly affected, in the view of my own depravity, the sinfulness, guilt, and odiousness of my character; and tears flowed in great plenty.\u201d\n\nHopkins set his energies to systematizing Edwards\u2019s thought. He drew on Edwards\u2019s distinction between natural ability and moral inability to battle against the incursions of liberals like Charles Chauncy and Jonathan Mayhew. Hopkins thought they had veered in an alarmingly Arminian direction, putting more emphasis on good behavior and personal agency than on God\u2019s sovereignty and man\u2019s fallen state. Hopkins believed uncompromisingly in the depravity of human nature. He argued that the traditional means of opening oneself to saving grace\u2014devotions, communion, prayer\u2014only further condemned those who practiced them but continued in unbelief. God was beholden to save no one who used these means, since \u201cthere are no promises of saving mercy made to sinners, upon any condition short of faith in Jesus Christ.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hopkins, true holiness consisted in spiritual rebirth marked by the transformation of self-love, which he considered the essence of sin, into selflessness or \u201cdisinterested benevolence.\u201d Edwards had discoursed on benevolence as primarily an aesthetic notion. To Hopkins, it was a moral and social imperative. He criticized what he saw as the selfish individualism of Yankee merchants and businessmen like those in the bustling port town of Newport, Rhode Island, where Hopkins became minister of the First Congregational Church in 1770. His attack against selfishness made him one of the earliest opponents of the African slave trade that greatly added to the wealth of Newport\u2019s merchants and seafarers. In the midst of the Revolution, Hopkins maintained that America could not expect deliverance if it continued in the \u201ccrying sin\u201d of \u201censlaving the Africans,\u201d for which God might \u201cyet punish us seven times more.\u201d Half a century later, abolitionists would echo the idea that Americans as a whole could be punished for the sin of slavery.\n\nHopkins\u2019s famous statement that true converts must be willing to be damned for God\u2019s glory also grew from his assault on selfish individualism: \u201cHe therefore cannot know that he loves God and shall be saved, until he knows he has that disposition which implies a willingness to be damned, if it be not most for the glory of God that he should be saved.\u201d In other words, to argue that it was cruel and arbitrary for some to be eternally damned and others saved was to think of one\u2019s own good instead of the eternal and higher good. Rather than agonize over their own eternal destiny, people should spend their energies trying to ameliorate moral and social ills and better their society. Fear of hell from self-love could not be a person\u2019s sole motivation to repent: the true mark of regeneration was the alignment of your will with God\u2019s for the good of all, even if you yourself were to be damned for reasons that were inscrutable to humans, but made perfect sense in the all-knowing mind of the all-wise and ultimately benevolent Creator.\n\nHopkins was not a popular preacher; he was known more as a theologian than a dynamic figure in the pulpit. His defense of innate depravity and the justice of God in choosing whom to damn went consciously against the grain of Enlightenment optimism and the emerging sense of the self as an individual, and not just a cog in society, that characterized the western transition to modernity. Still, despite his unpopularity with some, Hopkins\u2019s call for self-sacrifice for the sake of the greater good resonated in the new nation, where virtue seemed to be the only glue holding society together.\n\nJohn \u201cSalvation\u201d Murray (1741\u20121815)\n\nWhile Hopkins was defending his view of the nature of God, man, and eternal damnation, the two John Murrays landed in America. \u201cSalvation\u201d was the elder by a mere five months. The best source that we have of his personal religious history is his own autobiography. First published in Boston in 1816, a year after his death, the volume reminded Universalists of Murray\u2019s important role in founding the denomination in America.21 It also served as an apologetic, explaining to non-Universalists why a Calvinist would choose to abandon his faith. Murray portrayed himself as an erstwhile persecutor of Universalists who had had a change of heart and became one of the movement\u2019s biggest supporters, much like Paul with the early Church).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Fire and brimstone survived the Enlightenment and prospered at the dawn of the American republic \u2014 but why?", "title": "Damnation, American style: How American preachers reinvented hell", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Fire and brimstone survived the Enlightenment and prospered at the dawn of the American republic \u2014 but why?", "title": "Damnation, American style: How American preachers reinvented hell", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/06/damnation_american_style_how_american_preachers_reinvented_hell/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/damned_nation.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fire and brimstone survived the Enlightenment and prospered at the dawn of the American republic \u2014 but why?", "title": "Damnation, American style: How American preachers reinvented hell", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/damned_nation.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kathryn Gin Lum", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, American History, Books, Calvinists, Damnation, Editor's Picks, excerpts, George Washington, hell, Religion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3222\"", "article_summary": "To distinguish the two, their followers dubbed the Universalist \u201cSalvation\u201d Murray and the Presbyterian \u201cDamnation\u201d Murray.\nJohn \u201cSalvation\u201d Murray (1741\u20121815)While Hopkins was defending his view of the nature of God, man, and eternal damnation, the two John Murrays landed in America.\nOut of these revivals came intense debates over predestination, human nature, and the character of God, which dovetailed into the arguments over damnation.\nWhile \u201cSalvation\u201d preached the eventual redemption of all humanity, \u201cDamnation\u201d treated congregants and readers to vivid depictions of a hell gaping wide for sinners of every stripe.\nThose who rejected damnation had to explain how the promise of heaven for all would promote morality in the here-and-now."}
