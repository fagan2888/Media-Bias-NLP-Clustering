Minneapolis, MN (PRWEB) July 09, 2014

The IHC Group is pleased to announce the release of Metal Gap,1 an innovative product that helps bridge the gap in insurance coverage for many with high-deductible health insurance plans.

"As Americans covered by 'Obamacare' policies begin to file claims under their new policies, it has become very apparent that many people will struggle to pay the out-of-pocket percentage required before their coverage kicks in," said Dave Keller , Chief Sales and Marketing Officer for IHC Specialty Benefits, which is a member of The IHC Group .

"The most popular plan level, the Silver Plan, could have a deductible of over $4,000 for an individual. For many, that type of expense is financially devastating or would, at a minimum, cause severe financial hardship. This is particularly true for those unable to work because they are recovering from an accident, receiving treatment for a life-threatening disease, or disabled by a heart attack. That's why The IHC Group developed Metal Gap â€“ affordable coverage (in some cases as little as $1 per day) to pay for much of what the Obamacare 'metal' plans do not."

Metal Gap complements major-medical health insurance, providing between $3,500-$6,350 in accident coverage, $7,500 in critical illness coverage, an optional $500 in first-day hospital stay benefit, plus $500 a day for hospital confinements up to 10 days. Additionally, all Metal Gap plans provide discount vision and prescription drug coverage.

"Our Metal Gap cash benefit can be used for hospital bills, daycare, mortgage and car payments or anything else. The plans are designed to fill the gap, in many circumstances, between first dollar expenses and the maximum out-of-pocket allowed by Obamacare plans, but they can be used however the individual sees fit," added Keller.
