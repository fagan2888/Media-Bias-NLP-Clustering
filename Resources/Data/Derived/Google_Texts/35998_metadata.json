I drive my car. True, it\u2019s been adapted, but I do drive it.\u201d Fidyka, a former firefighter said.\n\nParalysis \u2014 the loss of muscle function for one or more muscles \u2014 affects nearly one in 50 Americans. Causes include stroke, trauma with nerve injury, cerebral palsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.\n\nWhile scientists initially thought that damaged nerve cells can\u2019t self-repair, experiments conducted since the 1980s have confirmed that some types of central nervous system neurons could regenerate under certain laboratory conditions. Research since then has brought forth the discovery of proteins that block the growth of nerves. Scientists have also facilitated axom growth, the replacement of lost cells, prevention of scarring on the site of spinal cord injury, and the redesign of physical therapy regimens.\n\nThe groundbreaking procedure, outlined in a recent issue of journal Cell Transplantation, culminates nearly 40 years of research conducted by University College London (UCL) Institute of Neurology Professor Geoff Raisman, which started with a study of the nose\u2019s olfactory cell\u2019s ability to restore itself.\n\nWhile Raisman considered the surgery a success, he and other UCL researchers said they don\u2019t want to jump to conclusions. Instead, they want to conduct the same procedure on two more patients suffering from spinal cord injuries similar to that of Fidkya.\n\n\u201cWe believe\u2026 this procedure is the breakthrough which, as it is further developed, will result in a historic change in the currently hopeless outlook for people disabled by spinal cord injury,\u201d Raisman told BBC.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The surgery and 19-month treatment has helped a Polish man regain feeling in his legs and live more independently.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The surgery and 19-month treatment has helped a Polish man regain feeling in his legs and live more independently.", "title": "Major Scientific Breakthrough Allows Paralyzed Man to Walk Again", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/10/22/3583020/scientific-breakthrough-allows-paralyzed-man-to-walk-again/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CAparalysis_tpftd-e1393338945775.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The surgery and 19-month treatment has helped a Polish man regain feeling in his legs and live more independently.", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CAparalysis_tpftd-e1393338945775-321x214.jpg", "title": "Major Scientific Breakthrough Allows Paralyzed Man to Walk Again", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CAparalysis_tpftd-e1393338945775.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/CAparalysis_tpftd-e1393338945775.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-22T12:46:04+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcdce\"", "article_summary": "Health Major Scientific Breakthrough Allows Paralyzed Man to Walk Again CREDIT:Years after a knife attack paralyzed him, a Polish man can walk again with the aid of a frame, thanks to what members of the medical community are calling a scientific breakthrough.\nCauses include stroke, trauma with nerve injury, cerebral palsy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease.\nInstead, they want to conduct the same procedure on two more patients suffering from spinal cord injuries similar to that of Fidkya.\n\u201cWe believe\u2026 this procedure is the breakthrough which, as it is further developed, will result in a historic change in the currently hopeless outlook for people disabled by spinal cord injury,\u201d Raisman told BBC.\nScientists have also facilitated axom growth, the replacement of lost cells, prevention of scarring on the site of spinal cord injury, and the redesign of physical therapy regimens."}
