The deadline to sign up under the Affordable Care Act is five weeks away.

U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., is working to sign up the uninsured. As part of that effort, Thompson's Affordable Health Care Enrollment Tour stopped at Tougaloo College.

Special Section: Health Care Reform

Area residents asked Thompson questions about health care options available to them. They could sign up for the Affordable Health Care or with a private insurance provider.

"Given the demographics of our state, we have some of the sickest people in the nation -- that's documented. Here's an opportunity to alleviate a lot of the pain and suffering those people endure," Thompson said.

Enrollment ends March 31 for this year's Affordable Health Care coverage.
