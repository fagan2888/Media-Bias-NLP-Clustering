There wasn\u2019t anything particularly surprising about the remarks, and the Republican leader conceded his vision won\u2019t be implemented so long as President Obama is in office.\n\nBut there was one part of the speech that jumped out at me as noteworthy. On health care policy, the new Speaker said \u201cthe other side\u201d \u2013 presumably, Democrats \u2013 opposes giving consumers choices, while Republicans want to encourage \u201cinsurance companies to compete for your business.\u201d It\u2019s an odd line of attack, since the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchange marketplaces were specifically designed to invite insurers to compete for consumers\u2019 business. I\u2019m not sure how he could have missed this detail.\n\nRyan added:\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of other ideas out there, but what all conservatives can agree on is this: We think government should encourage personal responsibility, not replace it. We think prices are going up because people have too few choices, not because they have too many. And we think this problem is so urgent that, next year, we are going to unveil a plan to replace every word of Obamacare.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s just skip the usual points about the efficacy of the ACA, the law\u2019s many successes, and the millions of Americans benefiting from its implementation. Suffice it to say, there\u2019s no credible reason to try \u2013 or even want to try, really \u2013 to replace \u201cevery word\u201d of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nWhat I found amusing, however, was Ryan\u2019s use of the word \u201curgent.\u201d\n\nAs the Republican leader sees it, there\u2019s no time to waste. The problems in the health care system are so great that the Speaker believes it\u2019s \u201curgent\u201d for his party to present their conservative alternative \u2013 nearly six years after the ACA was signed into law, nearly two years after the ACA was fully implemented. Now Ryan\u2019s serious about his party\u2019s replacement plan.\n\nIt\u2019s hard for even the most charitable observers not to laugh. On June 17, 2009, then-Rep. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of the House Republican leadership at the time, publicly declared that he was helping craft his party\u2019s alternative to the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI guarantee you we will provide you with a bill,\u201d he said six and a half years ago.\n\nThe same week, then-Minority Whip Eric Cantor (R-Va.) told reporters that the official Republican version of \u201cObamacare\u201d was just \u201c weeks away .\u201d\n\nfail every time. The Huffington Post\u2019s Jeffrey Young has gotten quite a bit of mileage out of a joke, documenting all of the many, many times in recent years GOP officials have said they\u2019re finally ready to unveil their big health care solution, only to quietlyevery time.\n\nWe were told 2014 would be different. In April 2014, House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said his party\u2019s plan was nearly done, but was being delayed \u201c at least a month .\u201d That was 20 months ago.\n\nThen we were told 2015 would be different. Ryan was tasked with personally heading up a Republican \u201c working group \u201d that would finally put together the GOP\u2019s health care plan. Then-House Speaker John Boehner promised Fox News, \u201cThere will be an alternative, and you\u2019re going to get to see it.\u201d\n\nThat was 11 months ago.\n\nAs of yesterday, however, Ryan believes the issue is \u201cso urgent\u201d that we\u2019ll see the Republican \u201cplan\u201d in 2016. And who knows, maybe we will. I wouldn\u2019t bet on it, but anything\u2019s possible.\n\nBut revisiting a piece from February, I think we can safely assume that the House GOP alternative to \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2013 if it ever exists \u2013 is going to be cover-your-eyes horrible. How can I know that? Because in order to actually reform the pre-2010 health care system \u2013 \u201creplacing every word\u201d of the ACA \u2013 policymakers have to commit to extensive public investments, expansive government regulation of the insurance industry, and a commitment to help struggling families receive guaranteed benefits.\n\nIn other words, to do reform right, Republicans would have to willingly take policy steps that are anathema to everything they believe about government. It\u2019s a safer bet they\u2019ll do reform wrong \u2013 if they follow through at all \u2013 and when the GOP alternative stands alongside \u201cObamacare\u201d and consumers are allowed to compare, it won\u2019t be much of a contest.\n\nThis point is routinely lost on much of the chattering class, but Republicans don\u2019t actually like health care reform, which is why we\u2019ve waited so many years to see a plan that still doesn\u2019t exist. GOP lawmakers didn\u2019t see the old system \u2013 the bankruptcies, the uninsured rates, the deaths, Americans paying more for less \u2013 as a problem requiring a solution, which is precisely why they haven\u2019t invested time and energy in writing a detailed reform blueprint.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Speaker Ryan sees an \"urgent\" need for a Republican alternative to the ACA.
