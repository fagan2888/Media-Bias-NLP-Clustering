General Assembly session was a set of definitive statements from new House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger on taxes, Medicaid and teacher funding.\n\nIn a press conference that followed Wednesday\u2019s brief session and swearing-in ceremonies, Berger and Moore made it clear that they had not budged on a refusal to support expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nNorth Carolina is one of 23 states not to opt for expansion, which was banned by state legislation passed in 2013. Gov. Pat McCrory has appeared to warm to the idea of expansion more recently, and he announced that he had discussed potential conditions for the state\u2019s expansion during his visit to the White House earlier this month.\n\nBut Berger told reporters last Wednesday that he still doesn\u2019t see a case for expansion. Moore said he was worried that while the federal government is covering the cost of expansion now, funding may quickly end, leaving the state to cover the costs.\n\nA recent study by George Washington University for the Cone Health Trust and the Reynolds Charitable Trust estimated that the state would have seen an additional 43,000 jobs and $21 billion in federal funding over a five-year period if it expanded the program. The study estimated that over the next few years more than 500,000 uninsured North Carolinians would qualify for the program under expansion.\n\nIn other remarks, Berger and Moore said they did not anticipate major changes to the state\u2019s tax code despite lower-than-anticipated revenues that have, so far, been roughly $200 million less than budgeted.\n\nBerger said it was too early to judge how tax cuts passed last year would affect revenues in the long term.\n\nThe two also said they plan to continue pushing for higher pay for starting teachers as promised in last year\u2019s education funding deal, which set a $35,000 target for starting pay.\n\nSenate committees named\n\nHenderson County Republican Sen. Tom Apodaca was named to a total of 12 committees in a reorganization announced last week.\n\nApodaca, chair of the powerful Rules and Operations committee, will also chair the Senate Ways and Means committee; co-chair the Insurance committee and committee on Pensions and Retirement and Aging; serve as vice-chair of the Appropriations Committee on Justice and Public Safety and co-chair the Appropriations Committee on Higher Education.\n\nOther key appointments for Senate members from Western North Carolina include:\n\n\u2022 Sen. Jim Davis, R-Macon: co-chair, Appropriations on General Government and Information Technology; co-chair, Sate and Local Government;\n\n\u2022 Sen. Ralph Hise, D-McDowell: co-chair, Appropriations on Health and Human Services; co-chair, Health Care; and\n\n\u2022 Sen. Dan Soucek, R-Watauga: co-chair, Education/Higher Education; co-chair, Appropriations Committee on Higher Education.\n\nNew rules issued\n\nIn one bit of new business in its brief session, House leaders unveiled a set of new temporary rules for the chamber that Speaker Moore said was aimed at adding a little more order and transparency.\n\nThe changes include a ban on Sunday votes and no longer allow for last-minute introductions of proposed committee substitutes, which were used last session to push through extensive rewrites of legislation with little notice. The new rules require that the substitutes be distributed to committee members no later than 9 p.m. the evening before a meeting.\n\nEminent domain bill\n\nAside from the rules legislation, the first actual bill of the session was introduced last week by Rep. Chuck McGrady, R-Henderson, and co-sponsored by Rep. Jonathan Jordan, R-Watauga.\n\nThe legislation calls for a constitutional amendment limiting the power of eminent domain to go before voters. The amendment would limit the power of state and local governments to condemn land for private development, require just compensation for condemned land and allow property owners request that a jury set the price.\n\nThe House approved a similar measure in 2013, but it was not taken up by the Senate.\n\nHouse still organizing\n\nThe Senate may have finished up with its committee appointments, but the House is still in flux. WNC\u2019s representatives have put in their requests, but, for now, will have to wait for word on co-chairs and committee appointments.\n\nOne member of the delegation reports at least a hint that more work may be coming.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been moved to a bigger office, and I\u2019m guessing that I\u2019ll be getting new responsibilities in the upcoming session,\u201d McGrady said in an email to Carolina Public Press last week before the session began. He declined to speculate what exactly the new digs mean.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\nGoogle\n\nPocket\n\nPrint\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"description": "And, in case you missed it, the biggest story out of last week\u2019s opening day of the 2015 N.C.
