Two-term State Rep. Nick Zerwas announced his re-election bid for House District seat 30A, which includes Big Lake, Big Lake Township, Elk River and Otsego.

Zerwas will once again seek the Republican Party endorsement.

“In my first two terms, we have had some big accomplishments for our area, including adding a lane on I-94, securing funding for Sherburne County Community Corrections and having the Kelley Farm project included in the 2014 bonding bill,” Zerwas said, noting alarms were sounded on Minnesota’s implementation of Obamacare, and the MNsure health exchange.

Zerwas lives in Elk River with his wife, Bette. Zerwas is the chair of the Health Licensure Subcommittee and serves on the Health and Human Services Policy Committee, Health and Human Services Finance Committee, Civil Law Committee, and the Public Safety Finance and Policy Committee.
