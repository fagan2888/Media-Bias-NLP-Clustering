They courted extreme segments of the Evangelical community who worked themselves into a fever pitch about living under sharia law and the dealing with the overthrow of Christianity.\n\nWith the 2016 presidential race in full swing, this Islamophobia is resurgent. Here are a few examples.\n\nEncouraging Targeting of Muslims: In January, Texas Senator Ted Cruz joked that it\u2019s \u201cnot ticked-off Presbyterians\u201d the United States is fighting; this month, Florida\u2019s Marco Rubio stole his joke, telling an audience our enemy is \u201cnot Presbyterian radicalism.\u201d The coded language hints that Muslims are the problem (even though the majority of terrorism the U.S. experiences is from non-Muslim right-wing extremists).\n\nStanding Alongside the Godfather of Islamophobia: Frank Gaffney runs the so-called Center for Security Policy, which will be hosting a conference this weekend. Five presidential candidates \u2014 Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, George Pataki, Carli Fiorina, and Bobby Jindal \u2014 will reportedly attend. Gaffney has suggested that Obama is a Muslim and that the Muslim Brotherhood has supposedly taken over the U.S. government.\n\nComplaining That Their Opponents are Loyal to Islam: Although most of the GOP has dropped birtherism (with the exception of Gaffney, who some candidates are shockingly courting, as noted above), there is a new form of questioning Obama\u2019s loyalty. Mike Huckabee said earlier this year, \u201cEverything he [Obama] does is against what Christians stand for, and he\u2019s against the Jews in Israel. The one group of people that can know they have his undying, unfailing support would be the Muslim community.\u201d This is probably news to Muslim Americans targeted by unfair spying and police tactics and Muslims abroad who give Obama very low approval ratings due to his continuance of hawkish foreign policy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The GOP is using code words and collaborating with some of the biggest fearmongers and not paying a price", "title": "Will any major Democrats stand up against the GOP\u2019s rampant Islamophobia?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The GOP is using code words and collaborating with some of the biggest fearmongers and not paying a price", "title": "Will any major Democrats stand up against the GOP\u2019s rampant Islamophobia?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/25/will_any_major_democrats_stand_up_against_the_gops_rampant_islamophobia_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/hillary_clinton19.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The GOP is using code words and collaborating with some of the biggest fearmongers and not paying a price", "title": "Will any major Democrats stand up against the GOP\u2019s rampant Islamophobia?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/hillary_clinton19.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Zaid Jilani", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, AlterNet, Democratic Party, GOP, Hillary Clinton, Islamophobia, Marco Rubio, Politics, Ted Cruz", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Five presidential candidates \u2014 Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, George Pataki, Carli Fiorina, and Bobby Jindal \u2014 will reportedly attend.\nStanding Alongside the Godfather of Islamophobia: Frank Gaffney runs the so-called Center for Security Policy, which will be hosting a conference this weekend.\nGaffney has suggested that Obama is a Muslim and that the Muslim Brotherhood has supposedly taken over the U.S. government.\nMike Huckabee said earlier this year, \u201cEverything he [Obama] does is against what Christians stand for, and he\u2019s against the Jews in Israel.\nWith the 2016 presidential race in full swing, this Islamophobia is resurgent."}
