You have to go look. You just can't be on automatic pilot for health insurance.\"\n\nThat's because of the way subsidies are determined. They're pegged to the cost of the second lowest silver level plan, but that cost is likely to change and with it, the subsidy a consumer would get.\n\n\"Everyone's going to have differences in their subsidies,\u201d Laszewski said. \u201cThe vast majority really probably need to change plans in order to continue with the same out of pocket premium. And they're not going to know if their premium has changed unless they go in and re-enroll.\"\n\nSaid Gibson, \"What's the different costs and what are the different benefits? Have they upgraded the benefits? Or, have they dropped providers in this case of health care, out of the network?\"\n\nJim Capretta of the Ethics and Public Policy Center noted that \"a lot of people aren't even clear yet whether their physician or the services they typically need will be covered by the plans they've been given through the exchanges. So if they're automatically enrolled in perhaps a subpar plan for their needs, that doesn\u2019t really help them going into 2015.\"\n\nIn addition, there is always the question of which doctors and hospitals are included in any given plan.\n\nHealth economist John Goodman explained, \"And those networks leave out the best doctors, they leave out the best hospitals, a lot of those plans charge you extra if you need an expensive drug for your cancer treatment, for example.\"\n\nJim Angle currently serves as chief national correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).
