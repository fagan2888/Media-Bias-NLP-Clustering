Three days after a huge explosion at a Mexican petrochemical plant, the death toll stands at 28, officials said.

Wednesday's blast at the Petroquimica Mexicana de Vinilo facility in the southern state of Veracruz sent large plumes of dark smoke and toxic fumes across the region and forced the evacuation of surrounding areas.

Pemex announced Friday that the death toll had risen to 28. PMV is a joint venture between Mexican petrochemicals consortium Mexichem and state oil firm Pemex.

Javier Duarte, governor of the state of Veracruz, told CNN affiliate Televisa that the blast was felt about 10 kilometers (six miles) away. Emergency protocols were put in place, with surrounding municipalities evacuated and schools closed in others, officials said.

A government Twitter account showed photos of plant workers being evacuated from the facility in a convoy.

Pemex said on its Twitter account that the fire had been brought under control by early Wednesday evening and that the plume of toxic smoke was dissipating quickly.

Veracruz government spokesman Raul Gutierrez told CNN that emergency personnel were collaborating with Pemex to evaluate the extent of the damage from the explosion.

It's not clear what caused the blast.

The blast was only the latest of several incidents reported at facilities linked to the Mexican state oil company in recent years.

In 2013, at least 37 people were killed in a blast at Pemex's headquarters in Mexico City, and a year earlier, dozens were killed in a fire at a Pemex gas facility in the state of Tamaulipas.
