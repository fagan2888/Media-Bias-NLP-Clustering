Ted Cruz took a moment\u2019s break from the chaos swirling around him in DC and knelt in prayer outside the White House Thursday. But he didn\u2019t pray for himself.\n\nThe prayer was for American pastor Saeed Abedini who, as of Thursday, has now spent one year in an Iranian prison for preaching his Christian faith.\n\nDavid Brody from Christian Broadcasting Network reported the following about the prayer said in front of the White House for Abedini on Thursday:\n\nNo, he\u2019s not praying that Barack Obama will overturn Obamacare and no, he\u2019s not praying that he will occupy the presidency one day. Instead, he\u2019s alongside Rev. Rob Schenck (from Faith and Action) and Rev. Frazier White (a Democrat and Obama supporter) praying for Saeed Abedini, who has been in an Iranian prison for one year. He is being persecuted for his faith to Jesus Christ. Who says Ted Cruz isn\u2019t bipartisan? I have not only interviewed Ted Cruz many times, but I have spent time with him and his family. He is true Bible-believing Christian who is not ashamed of the Gospel. Of course the liberals don\u2019t want to hear that nonsense. They\u2019ll now be busy trying to figure out how to distort this picture in Adobe Photoshop.\n\nRev. Rob Schenck, who organized the prayer, wrote a piece about praying with Cruz called, \u201cRight and Left Fade in the Face of Glory.\u201d\n\nIn the image you see me at the center with my prayer stole as we intercede in Jesus\u2019 name for our brother in Christ and imprisoned pastor, Saeed Abedini, who has suffered in an Iranian prison for one year because of his faithful witness to Christ. Kneeling with me on my left (the significance of the placement should be noted) is the US senator Ted Cruz, a tea party Republican from Texas. Sen. Cruz just made wall-to-wall headlines for his 20+ hour filibuster opposing Obamacare, the President\u2019s signature legislative achievement. On my right (again, note the orientation) is Rev. Frazier White, a Democrat community organizer from my neighborhood of Capitol Hill, and a huge supporter of President Obama. At the moment the photo was taken, though, the politically polar opposite positions of the Senator and the Pastor were irrelevant. We were bowed before the Holy, the Supernal, the highest Lord in the universe, and the One and Only Eternal King. Everything else: party labels, policy positions, job descriptions, accents, zip codes, skin color, filibusters and organizing, were all utterly and completely dwarfed. In that moment of prayer\u2013especially for a fellow Christian, a persecuted believer, whose circumstances are for most us unimaginable\u2013our political and cultural squabbles seemed petty. Pastor White, Sen. Cruz, Rev. Pat Mahoney, Jordan and Anna Sekulow, myself, and so many others, were there in front of the White House to do the really and truly important business of crying out to God for one of our own that was suffering for his faith. We will, of course, get back to the temporal business of wrestling over public policy\u2013which remains critically important to me and to everyone else in the prayer line at the White House\u2013except in that one transcendent moment when, kneeling before the Heavenly Throne, we were all the same: sinners saved by grace, humbly crying out to God to help another soul in great distress. Perhaps if we spent more time crying out to God, we\u2019d waste less time shouting at each other. In prayer for Brother Saeed, his family, and all distressed believers around the globe, Rob\n\nRelated: \u201cWife of pastor jailed in Iran hand-delivers letter to new president\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "After everything he has been through the past week, U.S. Sen.
