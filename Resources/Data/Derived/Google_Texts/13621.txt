In honor of National Dog Day, the newly opened Brooklyn Heights Veterinary Hospital is hosting an unusual literary event — a reading by Brooklyn-based memoirist Liz Weber, author of “Memory Card Full” — for both dogs and humans. The event will take place on Aug. 26 from 7 to 9 p.m. and will offer wine and snacks for both humans and dogs (snacks only for the dogs).

National Dog Day was created in 2004 by Colleen Paige to show appreciation for dogs and their endearing patience, unquestioning loyalty and capacity for love.

Liz Weber understands dog love first hand. Her life began to unravel when her dog, Rufus, died of old age. She was forced to let go of the one constant in her life and move forward. “Memory Card Full” is a memoir of her life as a bartender, model and aspiring writer in Manhattan before and after Rufus.

Weber’s memoir charts her course through grief and ends at her realization that there were important things in life that Rufus’ love had caused her to avoid. She is finally able to accept that letting go of him is the best way to go on and find love for herself and others.

The Aug. 26 event begins at 7 p.m. The Brooklyn Heights Veterinary Hospital is located at 59 Hicks St. in Brooklyn Heights.
