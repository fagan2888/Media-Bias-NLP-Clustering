(AP) - A federal agency says a Colorado oilman, known for filing scores of lawsuits against energy companies claiming they underreported natural gas production, hasn\u2019t responded to a civil penalty from a federal agency alleging that he failed to report production on his own leases.\n\nThe Office of Natural Resources Revenue announced in November it had assessed a civil penalty of over $46,000 against Jack J. Grynberg. It alleged he failed to report production on federal leases in Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico.\n\nAgency spokesman Patrick Etchart said recently that Grynberg didn\u2019t respond to the penalty or ask for a hearing. He said the Treasury Department will pursue collection of the debt.\n\nGene Webb, a spokesman for Grynberg, however, said Grynberg has asked federal officials for a penalty hearing.\n\n\u201cThey did receive all the reports, some were late and some weren\u2019t,\u201d Webb said. \u201cThere is a dispute and we\u2019ve contested a lot of the fines, because some of them - the wells are old, they\u2019ve never produced for a long time, and some are even plugged. So there\u2019s a little misunderstanding on both parties\u2019 part.\u201d\n\nGrynberg received national attention when he filed dozens of lawsuits against natural gas and pipeline companies around the West, claiming they had underreported their production on federal lands. In bringing the lawsuits, he had sought payment as a whistleblower under the federal False Claims Act.\n\nIn 2006, U.S. District Judge William Downes of Casper rejected Grynberg\u2019s claims. Downes dismissed 73 lawsuits that Grynberg had filed.\n\nDownes concluded that most of Grynberg\u2019s knowledge of the companies\u2019 gas-measurement techniques was secondhand or speculative. Federal law requires that to collect a bounty, a person must show the government new information about the fraud they allege.\n\n\u201cGrynberg deliberately chose to make sweeping allegations of fraud against nearly the entire industry, based in large part on rank speculation,\u201d Downes wrote. He made Grynberg responsible for legal fees and costs incurred by the companies Grynberg sued.\n\nDozens of companies are pressing those claims against Grynberg. U.S. District Judge Alan B. Johnson of Cheyenne presides over the litigation.\n\nAlso, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue issued a civil penalty of over $11,500 against Grynberg Petroleum Company in March, alleging failure to report production on federal leases in Wyoming and New Mexico.\n\nEtchart said the company submitted production reports associated with the March penalty and has requested a hearing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal agency says a Colorado oilman, known for filing scores of lawsuits against energy companies claiming they underreported natural gas production, hasn't responded to a civil penalty from a federal agency alleging that he failed to report production on his own leases.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/1/feds-say-colorado-oilman-hasnt-responded-to-penalt/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A federal agency says a Colorado oilman, known for filing scores of lawsuits against energy companies claiming they underreported natural gas production, hasn\u2019t responded to a civil penalty from a federal agency alleging that he failed to report production on his own leases.", "title": "Feds say Colorado oilman hasn\u2019t responded to penalty"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "A federal agency says a Colorado oilman, known for filing scores of lawsuits against energy companies claiming they underreported natural gas production, hasn't responded to a civil penalty from a fed", "card": "summary", "title": "Feds say Colorado oilman hasn\u2019t responded to penalty"}, "Author": "BEN NEARY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "It alleged he failed to report production on federal leases in Wyoming, Colorado and New Mexico.\nHe made Grynberg responsible for legal fees and costs incurred by the companies Grynberg sued.\nGene Webb, a spokesman for Grynberg, however, said Grynberg has asked federal officials for a penalty hearing.\nThe Office of Natural Resources Revenue announced in November it had assessed a civil penalty of over $46,000 against Jack J.
