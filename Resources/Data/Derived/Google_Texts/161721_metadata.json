Holder case about voting rights, spoke in depth about her recent public statements about the Court\u2019s conservatives as being activists by using the court system to overrule laws.\n\nIn a recent New York Times interview, Ginsburg issued a definition of activism: \u201cif it\u2019s measured in terms of readiness to overturn legislation, this is one of the most activist courts in history.\u201d\n\nAt the National Constitution Center, Justice Ginsburg explained in detail two examples of what she sees as activism.\n\n\u201cIt is a court that is not at all hesitant to overturn legislation passed by the Congress \u2026 take two very recent headline examples,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Health Care Act passed Congress, but the Court held that the Commerce Clause didn\u2019t go that far, but thank goodness there was a taxing power that saved the case,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut the readiness to strike down a piece of legislation under the Commerce Clause \u2026 it was astounding to me.\u201d\n\nJustice Ginsburg also spoke about the recent decision in the Voting Rights Act case, in which a 5-4 majority sent parts of the law back to Congress to be rewritten.\n\n\u201cThe worst case was the Voting Rights Act case. That passed Congress overwhelmingly and I think it was unanimous in the Senate \u2026 if anyone knows about Voting Rights, how it affects the system, I think the elected representatives, have an appreciation of that, that the unelected judges don\u2019t have. Yet despite the overwhelming majority in Congress that passed the Voting Rights Act , the court said, \u2018that won\u2019t do\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThat is an example of striking down legislation on a subject that the people in the political arena are better informed about than the Court is.\u201d\n\nJustice Ginsburg said her model as a lead dissenter on the Court was John Paul Stevens.\n\n\u201cI was heir to that role as the most senior justice on the dissent side,\u201d she said.\n\nOne of the memorable lines of her dissent in Shelby was, \u201c\u201cIt is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the storm is raging,\u201d Justice Ginsburg said about voter ID laws that were quickly implemented in states like Texas after the Shelby decision.\n\n\u201cI expected that to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cNow it\u2019s a problem what to do, [with] closing the polls early, putting them in inconvenient places,\u201d she said.\n\nNote: You can watch the full 90-minute interview with Justice Ginsburg in video from C-SPAN below.
