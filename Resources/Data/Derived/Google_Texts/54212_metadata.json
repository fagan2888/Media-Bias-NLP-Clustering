I\u2019m worried about my house, my car payments, my family.\u201d\n\nCalderwood, 45, is a waitress at a popular Topeka breakfast and lunch spot just a few blocks from the Kansas Statehouse. Her husband is a construction worker whose hours fluctuate with the seasons.\n\nWhen the second enrollment period opened in November 2014, the couple signed up for an Obamacare plan. The federal tax credits their income qualified them for made it affordable, Calderwood said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re covering my bills. I\u2019m not racking up hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of medical bills anymore.\u201d\n\nCalderwood\u2019s new policy covered most of the cost of a recent surgery to remove her spleen. But she said it was the process of getting her post-surgery prescriptions filled that convinced her husband of the policy\u2019s value. Not used to having coverage, he forgot to mention it to the pharmacist and ended up paying full price \u2014 $140 in cash.\n\nCalderwood said she worried she wouldn\u2019t be able to pay the water bill until she realized what had happened. When she went back to the pharmacy with her new insurance card, she said, the pharmacist refunded her money and she only had to pay $10 for the prescriptions.\n\nPrior to the Affordable Care Act, it would have been virtually impossible for Calderwood to purchase affordable coverage because of her pre-existing health problems. Denying coverage to sick people was one of the ways that insurance companies managed their risk.\n\nNot surprisingly, a significant number of Kansans who purchased Obamacare coverage in the initial enrollment period were older and less healthy than the general population, said Matt All, a senior vice president for Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, the state\u2019s largest health insurer.\n\n\u201cThat has come through in the claims data,\u201d All said. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that we\u2019re going to have to deal with, and it\u2019s an issue that the system is going to have to deal with.\u201d\n\nIf the trend continues, many expect it will drive up the cost of health insurance premiums. But that hasn\u2019t happened yet. The average premium for all 82 plans offered in the Kansas Obamacare marketplace increased just 0.1 percent from the first enrollment period to the second, which is open through April 30 for certain groups.\n\nThe newly covered Kansans are different in other ways as well, All said. Because it\u2019s the first time many of them have had insurance, they\u2019re having to learn how to use it.\n\n\u201cSo, they have different kinds of questions, more basic questions than what we\u2019re used to,\u201d he said.\n\nDebbie Berndsen oversees a network of navigators across the state who are trained to help people shop for coverage. She said as consumers new to the insurance market learn about deductibles, copays and provider networks, they\u2019re becoming more selective.\n\nDuring the first enrollment period, Berndsen said consumers were primarily focused on price \u2014 the cost of their monthly premiums. But when they returned in the second enrollment period, they were more focused on ensuring they had the coverage they needed.\n\n\u201cA lot of those people were coming back this year after living with those plans,\u201d Berndsen said. \u201cI see a trend looking more at what your coverage will be versus what the premium will be.\u201d\n\nJim McLean is executive editor of KHI News Service in Topeka, a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Sherri Calderwood\u2019s Obamacare story isn\u2019t unique.
