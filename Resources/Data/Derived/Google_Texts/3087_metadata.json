Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s philosophy of big government has turned former Gov. Bob Ehrlich\u2019s billion-dollar surplus into a deficit. He was so short of money, he needed to raid the transportation trust fund to the tune of $1.1 billion and spend it on nontransportation projects.\n\nEver wonder why the dualization of Route 113 in Worcester County is not finished? He is trying to recoup the money by levying other taxes on the rest of us (including businesses). Politicians need to understand that every increase to the cost of doing business in this state is passed on to consumers. We pay, not the business directly. But when it becomes too expensive to do business in Maryland, businesses leave and we have, not only unemployment, but we lose the goods and services that that business provided. Unemployed people absorb taxes, not pay them. Delegate Mike McDermott understands all this, as indicated by his record as mayor of Pocomoke City and Maryland delegate.\n\nMaryland used to rank 25th among the nation\u2019s most business-friendly states, but we have dropped to 42nd since O\u2019Malley and Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown took over. Business-friendly ratings for nearby states are: Delaware, 14th; Pennsylvania, 19th; West Virginia, 23rd, Virginia, 27th. Maryland once had 11 Fortune 500 companies and poultry operations were expanding. Only McCormick remains of those 11 companies \u2014 and McCormick is considering relocating to Pennsylvania.\n\nOppressive requirements placed on our farmers have stifled the poultry industry\u2019s growth. Example: the proposed 5 percent \u201cchicken tax,\u201d which would affect 46,000 Maryland jobs. We have lost more than 6,500 businesses. Unemployment has increased and state government spending increased by more than $10 billion since O\u2019Malley took office; 40 taxes have been increased, including the rain tax, sales tax, hospital bed tax, corporation tax, death and birth taxes, tobacco tax, title tax, hotel rental and building excise taxes, higher tolls, the liquor tax and the motor vehicle excise tax; the flush tax doubled.\n\nThis is nothing short of legalized extortion.\n\nIf O\u2019Malley and our state legislatures needed money, they could have followed Pennsylvania\u2019s lucrative lead. That state drilled 54,347 wells for natural gas in the Marcellus Shale Formation in 2003 \u2014 with no problems. This could have catapulted Maryland to prosperity.\n\nInstead, pro-tax lawmaker O\u2019Malley clones like Sen. Jim Mathias, Delegate Norman Conway and Brown chose to extort the money from citizens directly and indirectly while voting down natural gas drilling. Gasoline taxes go up every July 1.\n\nWe in this immediate area are not yet affected by the rain tax, which ridiculously taxes you on how much rain rolls off your roof and driveway. I said, \u201cnot yet\u201d! How do big box stores like Wal-Mart deal with a tax dependent on how large their roofs and parking lots are? They increase the cost of their goods. Once again, we pay.\n\nWe have also become a state that\u2019s friendly to illegal aliens, Common Core Standards (now disguised as Maryland College and Career Ready Standards), same-sex marriage, Obamacare (leaving thousands without insurance), gun control, Agenda 21 and convicted felons.\n\nWhy would people and businesses want to relocate in this state?\n\nDennis W. Evans lives in Berlin.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/opinion/columnists/2014/09/14/dennis-w-evans-opinion/15624571/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Dennis W.
