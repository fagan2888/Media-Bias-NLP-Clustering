Helen Williams, 44, of Clifton Street, is charged with criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature.

North Charleston police arrested a woman early Christmas morning after she reportedly stabbed a man with a ceramic squirrel in an argument over beer.

Helen Williams, 44, of Clifton Street, is charged with criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature, Charleston County jail records show.

Police officers were called to Clifton Street shortly after midnight Wednesday concerning the stabbing, an incident report states.

According to the report, a wounded 41-year-old man ran to a neighbor's home and called 911 after the alleged attack.

Officers noticed scratches on the man's face and a large amount of blood smeared across his upper body and down his arms. A deep cut marred the man's shoulder and chest, police said.

When questioned by police, Williams reported that the man merely fell, accidentally cutting himself.

Her hands and clothes, however, also were covered in blood. She denied that the blood belonged to the wounded man, police said.

The wounded man offered police a different version of events.

According to the report, he walked to a store earlier in the night to buy beer, but the store was closed.

Williams grew angry that the man returned without the beer, the report said.

She grabbed a ceramic squirrel and hit the man over the head out of anger, police said. Williams then stabbed him in the shoulder and chest with the item, the report said.

Paramedics transported the wounded man to a nearby hospital for treatment.

Williams was held at the Charleston County jail in lieu of $10,000 bail, jail records show.
