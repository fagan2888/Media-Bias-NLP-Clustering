And just last week he re-drew a line in the sand for congressional Republicans flirting with shutting down the government over his Affordable Care Act and looking for spending cuts as part of a separate deal to increase the federal debt limit.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not happening,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI will not negotiate over the full faith and credit of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe president has had mixed success in keeping that vow over the past few years.\n\nHe managed in January to get the debt ceiling raised without yielding to Republicans\u2019 demand for accompanying spending cuts.\n\nHowever, in 2011 he failed to reach a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d with House Republicans over the debt ceiling, forcing both sides to eventually accept a series of drastic spending cuts known as sequester.\n\n\u201cThe sequester is not something that I've proposed,\u201d Obama announced in his final 2012 presidential debate. \u201cIt is something that Congress has proposed.\u201d\n\nPolitiFact -- the Pulitzer Prize-winning project of the Tampa Bay Times that has essentially tracked all of the president\u2019s major promises -- ruled Obama\u2019s argument \u201cmostly false.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was Obama\u2019s negotiating team that came up with the idea,\u201d wrote PolitiFact.\n\nThe project finds that Obama has kept 241, or 45 percent, of his roughly 500 campaign promises, while breaking 118, or 22 percent, and compromising on roughly 25 percent. The remaining 8 percent are essentially still to be determined.\n\nThough tracking a president\u2019s promises is among Washington\u2019s favorite parlor games, Obama\u2019s \u201cred line\u201d vow in August 2012 has perhaps become his most debated and closely watched -- as it plays out on an international stage.\n\nObama waited for months, amid reports that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was using a chemical weapon in that country\u2019s roughly 2-year-long civil war. However, after reviewing compelling evidence about an Aug. 21 sarin-gas attack that killed nearly 1,500 Syrians, the president said the United States must take military action.\n\nThe president appeared to try to blur the red line when he said earlier this month: \"I didn\u2019t set a red line. The world set a red line. \u2026 My credibility isn't on the line. The international community\u2019s credibility is on the line.\"\n\nThe outcome remains in flux as Congress, at the president\u2019s request, considers whether to authorize the use of limited military force and Syria moves closer to a diplomatic solution in which it would put its chemical weapons under international control.\n\nPolitiFact has picked Obama\u2019s top 25 promises and concluded he has kept nine, broken six and compromised on seven with three still in the works.\n\nAmong the most significant kept promises are removing U.S. combat troops from Iraq and ending the use of torture as an interrogation tactic on international prisoners.\n\nObama\u2019s failure to close the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center and imposing tougher rules on the so-called \u201crevolving door\u201d for lobbyists and former officials are among the top broken promises for PolitiFact and others -- with a little more than three years remaining in his two-term presidency.\n\nPolitiFact argues that Obama\u2019 path to citizenship remains a work in progress.\n\nTo be sure, he must wait for the Republican-led House to vote now that the Democrat-controlled Senate has passed the legislation.\n\nThe project also concludes Obama\u2019s promise to create 5 million new \u201cgreen\u201d jobs also is still in the works.\n\nHowever, PolitiFact reports the federal government didn't count such jobs until this year, which make tracking the promise difficult. And the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank, estimates the U.S. economy had 2.1 million green jobs in 2003 and 2.7 million of them in 2010, which would make the goal of 5 million hard to reach by 2016.\n\n\n\nPolitiFact also concludes the president broke his promise to cut a typical family\u2019s insurance premiums by as much as $2,500 annually under ObamaCare.\n\nHowever, the project didn\u2019t address the president\u2019s June 2009 promise that \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your health care plan, period.\u201d\n\nUnions have argued that ObamaCare could make the cost of insurance for workers under multi employer plans more expensive, forcing them into the so-called government backed \u201cexchanges.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration and Congress must not allow this to happen,\u201d the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers said this summer.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX
