Both siblings insist their brotherhood has nothing to do with on-field chemistry, but when you watch, you might disagree.\n\n\"I don't think that,\" said Kaylon Gray. \"I think I.. just be gettin' more separation.\"\n\nWhen he is isn't passing to his little brother, the elder Gray is connection with senior tight end Abe Mars.\n\n\"We've been playing together, him at quarter-back, me at tight end since seventh grade,\" said Mars. \"It's just kinda worked out a lot\"\n\nOn the other side of the ball, Abe's twin brother Fent plays middle linebacker. He has a nose for the football, as was shown when he recorded 19 tackles in a 34-27 victory over Forest.\n\n\"You realize how quick he reads and how quick he sees things, and he sees things before, as a coach, you would even see,\" said Head Coach Teddy Dyess. \"He had some big shoes to fill. You know, C.J. Johnson played there, and then Fent steps in there as a sophomore and steps in those shoes and has done a great job in that spot.\"\n\nAlong with older cousins William and Adam, the twins are the fourth generation of Mars to play for Philadelphia.\n\n\"We always go visit our grandfather on Thursday to have a pep rally,\" said Fent Mars. \"So he'll talk about what he did when he played, and we talk about what we're going to do Friday night.\"\n\n\"It helps us play harder. When he [Fent] does good, that means I want to do better,\" said Abe Mars. \"It's just kind of a competition the whole time. It just helps us play better\"\n\nRegardless of who wins that competition, it's Philadelphia who benefits. It's these four brothers who will carry the 10-1 Tornadoes into the playoffs.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Romon Gray has opened up the Philadelphia passing game with players like his little brother, Kaylon, and tight end Abe Mars.
