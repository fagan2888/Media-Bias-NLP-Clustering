Texas hospital leader 'deeply sorry'\n\nA top official from the Texas hospital system that had the first Ebola case on U.S. soil will apologize for how it was handled before a congressional committee Thursday.\n\nDaniel Varga, the chief clinical officer of Texas Health Resources, plans to tell a House subcommittee that he is \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the mistakes that his hospital made in not correctly diagnosing Thomas Duncan. He will also say that Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas \u201cinadvertently provided some information [to the public] that was inaccurate and had to be corrected.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nHe plans to praise nurse Nina Pham \u2014 who was initially criticized for breaching safety protocol \u2014 as an \u201cextremely skilled\u201d nurse who used \u201cfull protective measures under the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] protocols.\u201d The hospital doesn\u2019t know how she was exposed but is \u201cporing over records and observations\u201d to find the answers, his prepared testimony states.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Obama cancels trip for Ebola meeting)\n\nVarga will also tell the committee that the hospital has changed its procedures to now immediately ask emergency department patients about their travel history. It will also implement more \u201cproactive, intensive and focused training\u201d for diagnosing the virus.\n\nHis remarks also mention the second hospital nurse who has become sick with Ebola, news that was announced Wednesday. Wednesday evening, Amber Vinson was flown to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta for treatment at its specialized biocontainment unit. Since August, Emory has treated three aid workers stricken with the disease while in West Africa.\n\nLike Pham, who is hospitalized in Dallas with Ebola, Vinson provided care to Duncan, the Liberian national who died at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas a week ago. That hospital has become the focal point of Ebola in Dallas.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: 2nd worker tests positive for Ebola)\n\nThe CDC is investigating how the virus spread in the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit. CDC Director Tom Frieden said health care workers used protective gear inconsistently in the first few days after Duncan was admitted, before the Ebola diagnosis was confirmed. Several of them had \u201csubstantial contact\u201d with him, and four are being monitored intensively.\n\nVinson flew on Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 from Cleveland to Dallas the night before she became ill, and although the risk that she spread the virus is \u201cextremely low,\u201d public health authorities are following up with passengers on the flight, Frieden told a briefing.\n\nThe woman \u201cshould not have flown\u201d on a commercial flight while knowing she had come in contact with an Ebola patient, Frieden said.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: In world of Ebola, no room for error)\n\nPresident Barack Obama postponed a Wednesday campaign trip to New Jersey and Connecticut. He instead met with advisers to discuss the government\u2019s response to Ebola.\n\nVinson\u2019s infection is the third U.S. case of the disease. It is the second case transmitted in this country and only the third time the disease has been spread outside West Africa. A Spanish nursing assistant became infected in a Madrid hospital.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Daniel Varga will apologize to a congressional committee for how the Ebola case was handled.", "og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Daniel Varga will apologize to a congressional committee for how the Ebola case was handled.", "title": "socialHeadline", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/ebola-frontier-airlines-111911.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/10/15/141015_frontier_plane_gty_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "keywords": "Health Care,Airlines,CDC,Ebola,Cleveland", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/kathryn.wolfe"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Texas hospital leader 'deeply sorry'A top official from the Texas hospital system that had the first Ebola case on U.S. soil will apologize for how it was handled before a congressional committee Thursday.\nHis remarks also mention the second hospital nurse who has become sick with Ebola, news that was announced Wednesday.\nDaniel Varga, the chief clinical officer of Texas Health Resources, plans to tell a House subcommittee that he is \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for the mistakes that his hospital made in not correctly diagnosing Thomas Duncan.\nLike Pham, who is hospitalized in Dallas with Ebola, Vinson provided care to Duncan, the Liberian national who died at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas a week ago.\nThat hospital has become the focal point of Ebola in Dallas."}
