The Ebola virus is not transmitted via the air, only via bodily fluids like blood and vomit.\n\nBut amidst reports that the the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the US was sent home from the hospital when he first showed up, many are wondering: Just what does it feel like to have Ebola?\n\nAt first, it feels much like a flu. People develop a fever and complain of headache, sore throat, muscle pain, and weakness. At this stage, the viral load in someone's system is low, and the disease could be mistaken for many more common ailments.\n\nKent Brantly, an American doctor who acquired Ebola in West Africa and eventually recovered, describes hoping he had malaria, even though he was working actively with Ebola patients.\n\n\"The morning I woke up with Ebola, I felt a little warm,\" he explained, in an essay for Time describing his ordeal. His temperature was 100 F, but had reached 101.4 by noon. Within a few days, his fever hit 104.9 and other symptoms started kicking in.\n\nThe progression of the disease is alarming. Flu-like symptoms are soon followed by intense vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and impaired organ function. A large proportion of those infected also bleed internally and externally. Blood often flows from puncture sites (e.g., where IVs have been inserted) and mucous membranes (e.g., the nose, the eyelids).\n\nEbola is one of at least 30 viruses known to cause this constellation of symptoms, called viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome.\n\nAnother doctor in Liberia told WebMD that as Brantly got sicker and sicker, his breathing became extremely labored. \"I was certain,\" the doctor recalled, \"he had a couple of hours to live, at best.\"\n\nBrantly recovered after treatment at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, but in West Africa, more than half of those infected have died.\n\nThis AFP graphic, tweeted by the U.N., explains the basics of Ebola symptoms in the earliest stages and then after the disease has progressed:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Lauren F Friedman", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "The disease starts with flu-like symptoms and quickly escalates.", "creator": "fedira", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/what-does-ebola-feel-like-2014-10", "image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/53d68dea69bedd7c2d93ea67-506-253/heres-what-it-feels-like-to-have-ebola.jpg", "title": "Here's What It Feels Like To Have Ebola", "site": "BI_Science", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "science", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Health, Ebola Virus, Africa, Dallas, Lauren F Friedman,", "description": "The disease starts with flu-like symptoms and quickly escalates.", "author": "Lauren F Friedman", "sailthru.date": "2014-10-01", "sailthru.title": "Here's What It Feels Like To Have Ebola", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/53d68de16bb3f7995d523a5b-50-50/heres-what-it-feels-like-to-have-ebola.jpg", "news_keywords": "Health, Ebola Virus, Africa, Dallas, Lauren F Friedman,", "tbi-image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/53d68de16bb3f7995d523a5b/heres-what-it-feels-like-to-have-ebola.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2014-10-01", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/lauren-f-friedman"}, "sailthru.description": "The disease starts with flu-like symptoms and quickly escalates.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "The disease starts with flu-like symptoms and quickly escalates.", "title": "Here's What It Feels Like To Have Ebola", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/what-does-ebola-feel-like-2014-10", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/53d68dea69bedd7c2d93ea67-1190-625/heres-what-it-feels-like-to-have-ebola.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Here's What It Feels Like To Have Ebola", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/53d68de16bb3f7995d523a5b/heres-what-it-feels-like-to-have-ebola.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "science"}, "article_summary": "But amidst reports that the the first patient diagnosed with Ebola in the US was sent home from the hospital when he first showed up, many are wondering: Just what does it feel like to have Ebola?\nIf you think you have Ebola but have not had close contact with someone visibly ill from Ebola, you can officially relax.\nThis AFP graphic, tweeted by the U.N., explains the basics of Ebola symptoms in the earliest stages and then after the disease has progressed:\nKent Brantly, an American doctor who acquired Ebola in West Africa and eventually recovered, describes hoping he had malaria, even though he was working actively with Ebola patients.\nEbola is one of at least 30 viruses known to cause this constellation of symptoms, called viral hemorrhagic fever syndrome."}
