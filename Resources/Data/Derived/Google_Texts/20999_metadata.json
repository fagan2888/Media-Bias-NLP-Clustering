Among them was moving natural center Ryan O\u2019Reilly to Matt Duchene\u2019s line, playing left wing opposite P.A. Parenteau.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an easy adjustment for him. I think Ryan is very solid in his own zone (and) Dutchy and P.A. Parenteau are maybe not as solid as defensively as Ryan is,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI think it will make a very good line. And I think it\u2019 going to take pressure off of Nathan (MacKinnon).\u201d\n\nRoy said the plan remains the same for the 18-year-old rookie MacKinnon, who will begin as the third-line center with gritty linemates Steve Downie and Jamie McGinn. In the same story Downie talks about his recovery from major knee surgery in January.\n\nO\u2019Reilly and Duchene are excited about the opportunity to play together. O\u2019Reilly played left wing for Team Canada at the 2013 World Championship and said he\u2019s looking forward to be the primary \u201ctwo-way\u201d player on the line.\n\nMeanwhile, Roy said Gabe Landeskog will continue as captain, after Landeskog previously spoke to the media and thanked Roy for believing in him with the \u2018C\u2019 on his chest. Of course, Landeskog was named captain under the previous coaching staff and management, although Joe Sakic had a hand in the deal when Landeskog became the NHL\u2019s youngest captain a year ago. Roy obviously can choose his own captain, but Landy is the man. Sounds like newcomers Cory Sarich and Alex Tanguay \u2014 both Stanley Cup champions \u2014 might wear the \u2018A\u2019s, or O\u2019Reilly, Duchene, Paul Stastny or someone he didn\u2019t mention like Erik Johnson or Cody McLeod.\n\n\u201cThe leaders of the team don\u2019t need a C or an A on their jersey. We have great leaders on this team,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWe have Sarich. We have Tanguay. We have (goalie J.S.) Giguere. And Landy won\u2019t be alone. And there\u2019s other guys on this team that I\u2019m counting on \u2014 I mean Dutchy, O\u2019Reilly, Stastny. I think these guys are ready to take the lead of this team.\u201d\n\nRoy talked extensively about defensemen Ryan Wilson and Erik Johnson, as well as third-year pro Tyson Barrie. Roy said he likes the D-corps and the team is still $10 million under the cap. (He didn\u2019t mention the cap space but the improvement money is there.) Wilson told me he\u2019s 100 percent and champing at the bit after concussion limited him to 69 games in 2011-12 and a nagging ankle injury forced him to miss 36-of-48 games last season. EJ wasn\u2019t available but Roy said he just needs to stop thinking about the past and being that No. 1 overall pick.\n\nFinally, Roy was asked if he predicted his first NHL team would make the playoffs. I thought for sure he\u2019d say yes, given that most people close to the team \u2014 me included \u2014 think they have a good shot at No. 8 or better.\n\n\u201cNot too many experts put us in the playoffs and I would love to surprise them,\u201d Roy said.\n\nToday\u2019s video interviews from Roy, Duchene, Landeskog, O\u2019Reilly, Stastny and Tanguay can be found at my Tout feed. Adrian Dater and I will be doing video daily and, to be warned, we only have 45 seconds per clip so sometimes the discussion cuts off before it ends. (And yes, the picture on the left of my Tout page is Scott Parker ready to pummel me last season during a Denver Cutthroats charity game. Thank God were were just messin\u2019 around.)", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Avalanche,Denver Post,Matt Duchene,Mike Chambers,P.A.
