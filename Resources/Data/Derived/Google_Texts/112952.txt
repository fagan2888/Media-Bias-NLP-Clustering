Marco Gonzales, a former standout at Rocky Mountain High School in Fort Collins, will make his major-league debut in his home state Wednesday when the Cardinals call him up to face the Rockies, St. Louis manager Mike Matheny said Monday.

“He’s the kind of pitcher I used to love to catch,” said Matheny, a former big-league catcher. “He’s been throwing the ball well. I believe he’s going to give us a good chance.”

Gonzales, 22, who has been pitching for Double-A Springfield, will replace Jaime Garcia in the Cardinals lineup. Garcia and fellow pitcher Michael Wacha were put on St. Louis’ disabled list Sunday with shoulder injuries.

Gonzales was scheduled to pitch Wednesday for the Texas League in the Double-A all-star game. He has a 2.33 this season for Springfield, with 46 strikeouts and 10 walks.

He is the only Colorado high school pitcher to be the winning pitcher in four state championship games (2007-10).

“A lot of guys come in here (to Colorado) not knowing what to expect,” Matheny said of pitching at altitude. “But this is something he grew up with.”

Gonzales, a left-hander, joins a Cardinals rotation that has the National League’s best ERA this season.

“He’s pounding the strike zone. He’s getting quick outs,” Matheny said. “He’s able to work both sides of the plate and has above-average off-speed stuff.”

The Cardinals drafted Gonzales out of Gonzaga University a little more than a year ago, with the 19th pick in the first round.

“I didn’t have too many expectations (this year),” Gonzales told The Denver Post earlier this month. “I just wanted to compete. That’s the biggest thing for me, and the rest kind of takes care of itself.”
