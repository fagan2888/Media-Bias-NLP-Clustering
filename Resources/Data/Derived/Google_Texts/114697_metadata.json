Of the 11 co-ops that have ceased operating, GAO noted, six did not meet their individual enrollment projections.\n\nThe nearly two dozen consumer-oriented co-ops were created to enhance competition in individual states with subsidized insurance policies sold directly to individuals and small businesses. However, faulty business models, unrealistic enrollment and income projections, and unexpected cuts in federal assistance led to the collapse of a dozen co-ops throughout the country, including the largest one in New York state with more than 100,000 subscribers.\n\nRelated: Nearly Half of Obamacare Co-Ops Are Closing\n\nA recent Senate report severely criticized the Obama administration for its handling of the co-op program, which led to the loss of $1.2 billion of federal loans and startup funds. According to the report, Health and Human Services Department officials ignored numerous warnings from an independent accounting firm dating back to 2012 that most of the insurance co-ops were poorly conceived, structured and managed, and that many would almost certainly fail in their current state.\n\nCo-op enrollments doubled from 2014 to 2015, according to the GAO, but less than half of that was in co-ops that continued on in 2016. Moreover, enrollments for most co-ops differed significantly from their projections.\n\nThe demise of the dozen co-ops \u201crenew[s] questions previously raised about the long-term sustainability of the co-ops and the effects that they will ultimately have on states\u2019 health insurance markets,\u201d the GAO report stated.\n\nTo underscore the seriousness of the problem, GAO said that its investigators had learned from some federal officials that some of the co-ops still operating are not expected to break even by 2017.\n\nRelated: GOP Faults Obama and the ACA for Failure of Healthcare Co-ops\n\nThe closing of the dozen co-ops has had serious ramifications, besides the loss of $1.2 billion of the $2.4 billion that the Centers on Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) originally awarded to help establish the program in 2014.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that many thousands of physicians, hospitals and other providers in some states have yet to be paid for health services delivered to members insured by the co-ops. More than 500,000 people who had signed up for coverage lost it and had to scramble to find replacement coverage after their co-ops had folded.\n\n\u201cWith nearly half of the co-ops now closed, the failed experiment has wasted taxpayer dollars and forced patients and families to scramble for new insurance,\u201d Senate Finance Committee Chair Orrin Hatch, (R., Utah) said yesterday at a hearing into the co-ops\u2019 failed operations.\n\nThere is plenty of blame to go around in assessing the shortcomings of a program, which was originally conceived as an alternative to a government health insurance program. A possibly fatal moment came when the administration decided last October to provide just 12.6 percent of the $2.87 billion that insurers were seeking to offset losses.\n\nRelated: GOP Faults Obama and the ACA for Failure of Healthcare Co-ops\n\nThe decision to severely reduce funding of the \u201crisk corridor\u201d program designed to reimburse insurers battered by excessive losses led to a mass exit of these co-ops from the market. Executives of some of the co-ops complained that the Republican-controlled Congress undermined their ventures by sharply cutting funding that had been originally promised.\n\nIn an analysis in Reason.com, Eric Boehm questioned whether the co-ops weren\u2019t doomed to failure from the beginning by the way they were structured in the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cA government program being poorly run is nothing new, of course,\u201d wrote Boehm, a reporter with the Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity. \u201cBut the co-ops established under the health care law were subject to a series of regulations that make you wonder how they were ever supposed to succeed in the first place.\u201d\n\nFor example, the co-ops were barred from hiring anyone who had served at an executive level at any health insurance company in the country, he wrote. What\u2019s more, the co-ops were barred from raising capital apart from what they received in federal loans. They were limited in how they could compete with private insurers. And, perhaps most remarkably, they were prevented from ever turning a profit.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There are ominous new signs that what\u2019s left of the star-crossed Obamacare co-op progr", "title": "More Bad News for the Remaining Obamacare Co-ops", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/18/More-Bad-News-Remaining-Obamacare-Co-ops", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07242014_Obamacare_Site_Signup.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/18/More-Bad-News-Remaining-Obamacare-Co-ops", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/07242014_Obamacare_Site_Signup.png", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There are ominous new signs that what\u2019s left of the star-crossed Obamacare co-op progr", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd307a\"", "article_summary": "Related: Administration Officials Knew Obamacare Co-ops Were Failing in 2012\u201cOf the 11 co-ops that continued to operate as of January 4, 2016, six exceeded their 2015 enrollment projections by June 30, 2015,\u201d the GAO report states.\nThe demise of the dozen co-ops \u201crenew[s] questions previously raised about the long-term sustainability of the co-ops and the effects that they will ultimately have on states\u2019 health insurance markets,\u201d the GAO report stated.\nThere is plenty of blame to go around in assessing the shortcomings of a program, which was originally conceived as an alternative to a government health insurance program.\nThere are ominous new signs that what\u2019s left of the star-crossed Obamacare co-op program may be headed for another financial crisis unless the eleven remaining health insurance programs can pick up the pace of enrollments.\nOf the 11 co-ops that have ceased operating, GAO noted, six did not meet their individual enrollment projections."}
