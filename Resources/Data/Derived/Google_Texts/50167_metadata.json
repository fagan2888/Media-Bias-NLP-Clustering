It brings him back to Crested Butte\u2019s Rumors Coffee and Tea House on June 18 for a reading and signing.\n\nQ: You\u2019re passionate about water rights, having grown up in a community in which no one takes them for granted. But with \u201cThe Water Knife,\u201d are you at all concerned about turning off readers with a potentially activist tone?\n\nA: As an author, you\u2019re really grateful for the people who are supporting you, but on some other level that can be a dangerous echo chamber. What\u2019s interesting is the really dedicated fans who are like, \u201cWhatever, you and your climate change obsession.\u201d That\u2019s somewhat of a surprise because I think, \u201cWow, we see the world completely differently and yet you still like my writing? Well, thanks.\u201d But when you write fiction and do these really big, long projects that you\u2019re spending a year or two in, you mostly have to be satisfying yourself. People who are turned off by the fact that you have climate change as a subject tend to fit inside a much wider range of people who disapprove of the way you use violence, or the fact that you\u2019re writing YA or middle-grade novels.\n\nQ: Water is such an immediate issue, with the drought in California and other stories, but the subjects you\u2019re writing about don\u2019t seem quite as picked-over in the world of science fiction.\n\nA: I think competition on those subjects would lead us toward a better world. It\u2019s like, \u201cCome on in and join the party!\u201d There are 10 million stories about how computing is going to change our lives. I think we can have a few more about climate change, drought, water rights, the loss of biodiversity and how we adapt to a changing environment.\n\nQ: Beyond growing up in a rural, agricultural community, what drives to write about these subjects?\n\nA: The sources and research I use for my inspiration aren\u2019t your typical sci-fi subjects, but it\u2019s really driven by obsession and personal anxiety more than trying to take up the sword and do what\u2019s right. Writing is cathartic for me and a way to identify the demons and put them to rest in some ways. I\u2019m probably the one sci-fi writer who wants to be wrong about my (predictions).\n\nQ: Young adult fiction has become more respectable and profitable in recent years, so why \u2014 after having found success there \u2014 is your latest novel a shift away from that?\n\nA: It\u2019s weird because I see these things as all cohesive pieces of my personalty, my obsession and my art. Sometimes I want to write something like \u201cZombie Baseball Beatdown\u201d (Bacigalupi\u2019s 2013 middle-grade book, and a National Book Award finalist) or a caper or some slapstick. Other times I want to bounce around, so I\u2019ve been terribly unstrategic in that sense.\n\nQ: Does it weigh on you in terms of affecting book sales? Are you worried that fans of \u201cShip Breaker\u201d will abandon you?\n\nA: The world of genre (fiction) is littered with authors who had one series that succeeded and then nothing else, and there are warnings everywhere about not sinking your career. I know people who have gone into career death spins, and that\u2019s something you\u2019re always aware of as a writer. So it\u2019s definitely an experiment.\n\nQ: That said, you successfully cover a lot of serious topics in your YA and middle-grade fiction, however surreal or crazy they might be.\n\nA: Right, \u201cZombie Baseball Beatdown\u201d is about meatpacking plants and food safety and immigration and race \u2014 and kids beating zombies up with baseball bats. Books like that are really close to my heart, in part because my wife\u2019s a schoolteacher. As a writer, you should care about reluctant readers. You want these kids to feel like books are amazing and cool and that they\u2019re an escape. But books are the only entertainment media we expect to suck. A TV series, even if it\u2019s doing it badly, is trying desperately to hook you and hold you. Same with video games and movies. And yet, in schools we expect that a certain number of books are going to be boring for kids, and that that\u2019s OK because it\u2019s \u201cgood for them.\u201d This is not the message that gets young people reading.\n\nQ: In trying to balance weighty and entertaining, accessible and deep, what kind of approach do you take?\n\nA: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lose-lose thing, where you\u2019re either a pandering sell-out or a loser that no one reads. I feel like your job as an artist is actually to figure out how to be true to what you believe in, and then find people and suck them in, too. That\u2019s a win-win. You\u2019re supposed to be clever, and you\u2019re looking for that clever win where we all get what we want. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in.\n\nJohn Wenzel: 303-954-1642, jwenzel@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnwenzel", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado novelist Paolo Bacigalupi taps water shortages", "title": "Colorado novelist Paolo Bacigalupi taps water shortages", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/04/colorado-novelist-paolo-bacigalupi-taps-water-shortages/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150604__20150607_E1_FE04STPAOLOp1.jpg", "height": 439}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150604__20150607_E1_FE04STPAOLOp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-04T17:40:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T04:34:42+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd5cc\"", "article_summary": "A: As an author, you\u2019re really grateful for the people who are supporting you, but on some other level that can be a dangerous echo chamber.\nIf the long-term effects of water policy sound like a less-than-sexy subject for summer reading, you\u2019re clearly not familiar with Paolo Bacigalupi.\nQ: You\u2019re passionate about water rights, having grown up in a community in which no one takes them for granted.\nBut with \u201cThe Water Knife,\u201d are you at all concerned about turning off readers with a potentially activist tone?\nI know people who have gone into career death spins, and that\u2019s something you\u2019re always aware of as a writer."}
