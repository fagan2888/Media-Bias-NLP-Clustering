He said this week on the pre-campaign trail in Georgia that he believed Ohio \u201cdoesn\u2019t need\u201d such a policy. The stance echoes his previous comments that the bill \u201cisn\u2019t on [his] agenda.\u201d When pressed on whether he\u2019d sign it if it came to his desk, thus banning unions from collecting fees from all workers who benefit from their organizing efforts, he demurred, saying he doesn\u2019t \u201clive in the future.\u201d\n\nLabor and progressive groups are now sounding the alarm, saying that Kasich\u2019s line on right-to-work echoes what Michigan Governor Rick Snyder and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said, and both later supported and signed the policy into law.\n\nKasich\u2019s record with workers in his state has been checkered at best. He has actively been courting unions and sought their endorsements \u2014 a sharp contrast with some of his likely opponents, who are firing up crowds on the campaign trail by criticizing unions and blaming them for everything from the gender pay gap to state budget shortfalls.\n\nRepublican strategists have repeatedly referred to Kasich as a \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201cpragmatist\u201d who can appeal to blue collar workers.\n\nBut in 2011, Kasich pushed through a law barring public sector workers from collectively bargaining for better wages and working conditions \u2014 a law that went beyond a similar move in Wisconsin by including firefighters and police. That law that was overwhelmingly overturned by voters a year later, a strong rebuke of Kasich\u2019s policies left his approval rating in the 30s. He won back significant support by expanding Medicaid to nearly 300,000 uninsured, low-income residents.\n\nHowever, just before this Memorial Day weekend, the Governor issued an executive order stripping away union rights from nearly 10,000 independent home health-care and in-home child-care workers. The move undoes a law implemented by former Democratic Governor Ted Strickland that extended the ability to bargain with the state to those overlooked and underpaid sectors. Unions that used to represent those workers in Ohio, including the AFSCME and the SEIU are calling it a \u201cwar on caregivers,\u201d warning that it will discourage people from pursuing those careers.\n\nSomewhat ironically, Kasich credited the success of the President\u2019s Affordable Care Act \u2014 which he opposes and wants repealed \u2014 as part of his rationale for repealing those union rights. He said would have repealed his predecessor\u2019s law earlier, but held off out of concern that those independent workers would lose the health insurance provided by their unions. But \u201csince that time,\u201d he wrote, \u201chealth insurance has become widely available through other means, such as the federal health insurance exchanges.\u201d\n\nKasich is expected to declare his bid for the White House sometime around June 30.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Can John Kasich (R-OH) keep his moderate, blue collar reputation as he strips workers of collective bargaining rights?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Can John Kasich (R-OH) keep his moderate, blue collar reputation as he strips workers of collective bargaining rights?", "title": "Ohio Governor Wants Union Support Despite Anti-Union Policies", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/05/28/3663268/ohio-governor-tries-please-unions-anti-union-voters/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP994989434099.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Can John Kasich (R-OH) keep his moderate, blue collar reputation as he strips workers of collective bargaining rights?", "creator": "@AliceOllstein", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP994989434099-321x214.jpg", "title": "Ohio Governor Wants Union Support Despite Anti-Union Policies", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP994989434099.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/AP994989434099.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-28T08:00:45+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/AliceMOllstein"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d46\"", "article_summary": "Politics Ohio Governor Wants Union Support Despite Anti-Union Policies CREDIT: APOhio Governor John Kasich, who is preparing to run for President in 2016, is currently trying to tamp down rumors that he wants to implement a controversial right-to-work law in his home state.\nHe said this week on the pre-campaign trail in Georgia that he believed Ohio \u201cdoesn\u2019t need\u201d such a policy.\nHowever, just before this Memorial Day weekend, the Governor issued an executive order stripping away union rights from nearly 10,000 independent home health-care and in-home child-care workers.\nRepublican strategists have repeatedly referred to Kasich as a \u201cmoderate\u201d or \u201cpragmatist\u201d who can appeal to blue collar workers.\nSomewhat ironically, Kasich credited the success of the President\u2019s Affordable Care Act \u2014 which he opposes and wants repealed \u2014 as part of his rationale for repealing those union rights."}
