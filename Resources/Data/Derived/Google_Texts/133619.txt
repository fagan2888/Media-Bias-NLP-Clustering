Four days after getting a tummy tuck and liposuction at Elase Medical Spas and Cosmetic Surgery Center in Lake Mary, Rafaela Ortiz died from a pulmonary embolism, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Ortiz, a mother of two, was said to be in good overall health despite being borderline obese, according to the Sentinel. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons says tummy tucks are the nationâ€™s sixth most common cosmetic procedure, the Sentinel reports.

While surgical complications are relatively uncommon, when combined with another procedure such as liposuction an estimated one in 7,300 patients die, the Sentinel reports.
