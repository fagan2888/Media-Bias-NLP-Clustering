What I principally mean by that clich\u00e9 is that Cruz makes a more plausible human being when seen up close than in his animatronic television appearances, but he does not resemble a human being who came into the world by the usual method. He\u2019s both cute and sinister, a highly discordant combination. He\u2019s like a marzipan man brought to life by the kiss of a magic fairy, stuffed into overly tight blue jeans and sent toddling into middle-school cafeterias in the middle of nowhere to answer strange hypothetical questions about Fidel Castro attacking ISIS. It\u2019s all somewhat convincing, but you can still tell that under the 3-D printed clothing and the right-wing talking points, he\u2019s sugary and delicious.\n\nAnother contrast I observed on Friday evening during Cruz\u2019s town-hall appearance in this strip-mall suburb just north of the Massachusetts border is the one between the idea of Ted Cruz, fearless conservative warrior who has electrified the true believers of the right, and the real Ted Cruz who eventually showed up. Close to 300 potential voters and about 60 journalists packed into an overheated schoolroom here to meet the surprise victor of the Republican caucuses in Iowa, the firebrand who seeks to unite the evangelical and libertarian strains of the Republican Party and who prides himself on being loathed by the bipartisan Washington establishment.\n\nSome of the actual civilians who showed up were merely curious. Some had driven long distances to ask highly specific questions of the potentially heartbreaking or bee-in-bonnet variety, like the Castro-ISIS person or the man who suspected his brother had died after being overmedicated in a V.A. hospital. (He was one of six African-Americans in the crowd, a higher number than I expected.) Some were truly psyched, like the heavily tattooed biker-looking guy in the back of the room who kept throwing out supportive comments in a thick Yankee accent suggestive of a Mark Wahlberg character. What should Cruz do on his first day in office? \u201cT\u2019row Hillary in jail!\u201d (This comes up so often the candidate has a stock response: \u201cShe may already be there!\u201d) People in Washington say Cruz is unlikable because he hates big government! \u201cYa musta hit the tahget theah, Ted!\u201d\n\nIn any event, what all these people encountered was one of the most boring and tin-eared political performers of recent memory. (Although I probably shouldn\u2019t say that yet: I\u2019m catching Jeb Bush over the weekend.) Cruz and his surrogates repeatedly seek to compare him to Ronald Reagan, and his stump speech harps on the supposed parallels between the late 1970s and today: A struggling economy, Russia and Iran on the rise, a despised Democrat in the White House who has dragged the country to a low point. (I won\u2019t waste your time rebutting any of that.) But whatever else you want to say about Reagan, he was a natural public speaker with genuine warmth and charisma, who connected easily with people.\n\nTed Cruz has lab-grown GMO charisma-type product. He is a former Ivy League debater who has delivered his stump speech a zillion times, and has developed what is supposed to feel like a natural rhythm, with jokes thrown in at appropriate moments. He is undeniably working hard out here, but it all feels forced and difficult, like cramming squishy marzipan thighs into starched Levi\u2019s. Where the jokes about Cruz being a robot or an alien come from is the miasma of unease surrounding the whole performance. This is a guy who quotes compulsively from \u201cThe Princess Bride.\u201d Not from a Frank Capra movie or a John Wayne movie or \u201cHoosiers.\u201d \u201dThe Princess Bride.\u201d He\u2019s a right-wing think-tank nerd, who should be trading quips with friends over a $180 dinner in Georgetown instead of talking to strangers in a New Hampshire town whose main drag, in 2016, features a store for ham radio enthusiasts. (Ham radio and \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d kind of go together, am I right?)\n\nCruz had moments on Friday evening when he hit on something the audience really wanted to hear: They love the flat tax, and they really, really hate the Iran nuclear deal. But those applause lines almost seemed to happen by accident, and Cruz barely seemed to notice. He said the phrase \u201cflat tax\u201d once, got the big Pavlovian cheer he was looking for and hurried on, perhaps because he is intelligent enough to know that even if by some awful mischance he is elected president he will never, ever get such a thing passed. He got pretty worked up about the evils of Iran and ISIS and \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d without ever mentioning that ISIS and Iran are mortal enemies (as he surely knows), and the crowd loved his promise to \u201crip that Iran arms deal to shreds\u201d on his first day in office. Which is another thing he couldn\u2019t actually do.\n\nBut Cruz has the policy wonk\u2019s tendency to veer off onto extended tangents \u2014 about Muammar Gaddafi and Libya, in this case \u2014 that seem intended to prove how much smarter he is than everybody else, and every time that happened you could feel the energy drain out of the room a little more. Hearing the marzipan man promise to rain merciless death on distant, theoretical enemies is cool. Hearing him deliver a tendentious lecture about how Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton screwed everything up in Libya and Syria (said lecture drawing about equally from Paul Wolfowitz and Henry Kissinger) is not nearly so fun.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ls Cruz an alien robot, or a marzipan man?
