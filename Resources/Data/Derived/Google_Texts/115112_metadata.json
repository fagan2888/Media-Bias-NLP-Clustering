These types of exchanges are becoming increasingly popular, particularly with health plan premiums increasing as of late. Analysts predict that by 2018, approximately 40 million Americans will purchase health insurance through a private exchange \u2014 that\u2019s up from about 3.5 million today.\n\nArray makes money on a subscription-based model by selling branded private health exchange software to insurers, which in turn distribute the product out to employers.\n\nWith Array\u2019s solution, companies can offer what\u2019s called defined contribution plans. For example, a business could give a worker $800 dedicated to insurance each month and have them pick what coverage they need, whether it\u2019s medical, dental, or something unique like disability or critical-illness coverage. Rickert said that this simplifys the administration process for employers, while also giving employees more control.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all about empowering consumers to make the best health insurance and shopping decisions using our technology,\u201d he said.\n\nThere are other companies doing something similar to Array, but Rickert said that they focus less on technology and more on making commission off the transactions between insurers, employers, and employees. Array, meanwhile, touts the fact that it focuses on the time and money that those three parties can save with its cloud-based software.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in the business of becoming an insurance broker,\u201d he said.\n\nArray, which employs 70, has largely flown under the radar after launching back in 2006 as a startup that built one of the nation\u2019s first multi-carrier insurance exchanges. But when the Affordable Care Act went into effect four years ago, the company saw an opportunity to license private exchange software to insurers.\n\nIt\u2019s taken time for the healthcare space to adopt new innovations, Rickert explained. But now with more and more businesses realizing the benefits of a private health exchange, Array is seeing \u201cunprecedented demand\u201d that led to it bring in institutional money for the first time.\n\n\u201cThis is a big event for us,\u201d Rickert said. \u201cWe\u2019ve built the company to the point where we\u2019re ready to take advantage of a huge opportunity. It\u2019s a very exciting time \u2014 not only for us, but also in healthcare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The American healthcare system\u00a0is undergoing massive\u00a0changes, with new state and federal health insurance marketplaces now offering up more affordable ways", "application-name": "GeekWire", "og": {"site_name": "GeekWire", "description": "The American healthcare system\u00a0is undergoing massive\u00a0changes, with new state and federal health insurance marketplaces now offering up more affordable ways", "title": "After 8 years, Array Health raises $13M for private health insurance exchange platform", "locale": "en_US", "see_also": "http://www.geekwire.com/2015/alltech-joins-forces-with-regence-blueshield-for-geekwire-health-insurance-program/", "image": {"width": 411, "identifier": "http://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/jonathanrickert.jpg", "height": 411}, "updated_time": "2014-09-24T23:19:38-07:00", "url": "http://www.geekwire.com/2014/array-health/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The American healthcare system\u00a0is undergoing massive\u00a0changes, with new state and federal health insurance marketplaces now offering up more affordable ways", "creator": "@Taylor_Soper", "image": "http://www.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/jonathanrickert.jpg", "title": "After 8 years, Array Health raises $13M for private health insurance exchange platform", "site": "@geekwire", "widgets": {"link-color": "#be4825"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 364309080316986}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/geekwire", "published_time": "2014-09-25T04:00:47-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ichiro51", "section": "Tech", "modified_time": "2014-09-24T23:19:38-07:00", "tag": "Venture capital"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "healthcare, venture capital"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ad0\"", "article_summary": "Analysts predict that by 2018, approximately 40 million Americans will purchase health insurance through a private exchange \u2014 that\u2019s up from about 3.5 million today.\nArray makes money on a subscription-based model by selling branded private health exchange software to insurers, which in turn distribute the product out to employers.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all about empowering consumers to make the best health insurance and shopping decisions using our technology,\u201d he said.\nBut now with more and more businesses realizing the benefits of a private health exchange, Array is seeing \u201cunprecedented demand\u201d that led to it bring in institutional money for the first time.\nArray Health today announced its first institutional funding ever, reeling in a $13 million round led by Noro-Moseley Partners, with participation from Vocap Investment Partners."}
