Vibrant and strong to protect the needs of agriculture, the backbone of our economy with its 73,000 jobs.\n\nTo stand up to the lack of regulations that have allowed oil and gas companies to ravage your environment with complete impunity.\n\nTo stand up to your local politicians and your governor of deaf ears.\n\nTo stand up and demand that your children may pass to their children the wonders of this incredible place you are so fortunate to call home.\n\nLook for us.\n\n\u2014 Ron Horner, Pacific Grove\n\nSea otters are wild and fragile; leave them be\n\nI was so happy to see the March 13 article about the sea otters.\n\nEveryone feels affection for sea otters, especially the moms with babies, and it is natural to want to see them up close.\n\nThe article did not fully explain the importance of not approaching sea otters too closely. Sea otters are always struggling to get enough food. Once disturbed, a sea otter\u2019s metabolism increases, which leads to needing even more food to maintain health. Mother sea otters also have increased demands for even more food to keep up milk production, and for some, the stress is so great that they die from insufficient nutrition.\n\nWe have heard stories of the rare instance of the sea otter that climbed on a kayak. These stories have led to the misconception that they are friendly and it\u2019s OK to approach them. These few sea otters have become comfortable with people, and their actions have led to this misconception. They are wild and fragile animals, so they need to be respected. They are important to the Monterey Bay and we all need to do everything that we can to assure their safe living conditions here.\n\n\u2014 Connie Rose, Monterey\n\nWorking class hit with health premium increases\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is now law? Affordable to whom?\n\nWe buy our medical insurance through a group plan, one of the largest in the state, and our premiums went up 21 percent starting Jan. 1. The increase amounts to thousands annually for just two people. How is this affordable?\n\nThe current temporary occupant of the White House loves to extoll the virtues of his fabled health care plan. As usual, he refuses to talk about the down side as people who worked hard their whole lives to enjoy a reasonable retirement are hit with outlandish premium increases. Oh yes, he thinks we need to be paying \u201cour fair share.\u201d With co-pays and deductibles, we\u2019re paying a lot more than a fair share.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow Monterey County must enact a hiring freeze because of deficits and high costs. A significant part of those high costs is the 21 percent increase in health insurance premiums for employees. For the county, the increase alone amounts to millions more of our tax dollars.\n\nThus ends the fantasy of affordable health care.\n\n\u2014 Demetrius A. Kastros, Monterey\n\nFire department, county help in time of need\n\nOn March 6 our property, off Laureles Grade, sustained significant mudslide damage. The debris flowing down adjacent hillsides overwhelmed the channel that protected the property for the previous 12 years. Mud was nearly 2 feet high on our redwood deck and against one wall of the house.\n\nI called 911 and within 15 minutes an engine company from Monterey County Regional Fire District was on scene. The Gavil\u00e1n Fire Crew assisted with sandbagging and debris removal. Their service was magnificent and much appreciated. They saved our home.\n\nThe next few days we were visited many times by crews from the county\u2019s road department. They were hardworking as they protected the road by directing the mud and water and sandbagging adjacent property. Despite limited manpower at their disposal, they worked miracles.\n\nI want to express my thanks to those dedicated public employees who helped us in protecting our property, and whose efforts prevented much greater damage. My thanks also to Supervisor Dave Potter and his staff for their responsiveness and assistance in our time of need.\n\n\u2014 Len Foster, Salinas", "article_metadata": {"description": "Protect the Salinas River from fracking operationsOn March 12, members of Protect Monterey County took their initiative to the street to ban fracking in Monterey County.
