GoBankingRates credits the high ranking in the survey to the competition fostered by the numerous options.\n\nRon Ruman, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, said that Gov. Tom Wolf and Insurance Commissioner Teresa Miller have made it a priority to maintain the competitive market established in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cEvery person, every individual in the state of Pennsylvania, has at least four different options to choose from,\u201d Ruman said. \u201cThe top priority in approving rates [from insurance companies] was \u2026 to maintain that competitive market because it leads to more options and better prices.\u201d\n\nNew Mexico took the top spot for offering a trifecta of low premiums, low deductibles and flat-fee copays. Utah, California and Texas trailed New Mexico.\n\nDelaware, Indiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi and New Jersey were among the states with the worst health insurance costs, with Wyoming claiming the lowest spot.\n\nThe survey looked at silver plan options, one of four \u201cmetal categories\u201d in the Affordable Care Act where the insurance company covers 70 percent of cost. According to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 65 percent of those who purchased health insurance in the nation chose the silver option in 2014.\n\nThe survey chose to focus on insurance rates for a single, 40-year-old man who earns $40,000 a year and \u201clives in a major metropolitan area.\u201d\n\nPennsylvania has been enrolled since 2012 as a \u201cfederally facilitated marketplace\u201d state, meaning that a portion of the options for health insurance plans are organized by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nBased on a Department of Health and Human Services survey, nearly 472,700 residents of Pennsylvania enrolled in federally facilitated insurance options in 2015. The same study found that 51 percent of residents who were eligible for Advance Premium Tax Credit had a monthly premium of $100 or less.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), at the beginning of January, 8.6 million U.S. residents had enrolled in health insurance for 2016. In Pennsylvania, 412,914 people have enrolled, according to CMS figures. The deadline to apply for 2016 coverage is Jan. 31.\n\nDespite the promising statistics, a large portion of the population in Pennsylvania remains uninsured. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 994,000 Pennsylvania residents were uninsured as of October, less than 8 percent of the state population.\n\nRuman said the Pennsylvania government has been working to bring the percentage of uninsured people down even more by publicizing the insurance options through press conferences, radio talk shows and resources available on their website. In addition, Gov. Wolf recently expanded funding for Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThe percentage [of uninsured residents] has been falling, and we expect it to fall further,\u201d Ruman said. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly working to make it fall further and we\u2019ll keep working until the end when everyone\u2019s insured.\u201d\n\nReach PublicSource intern Lauren Rosenblatt at lhrosenblatt@gmail.com.
