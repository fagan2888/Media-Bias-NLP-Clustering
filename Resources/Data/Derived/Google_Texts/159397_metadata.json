The reason: the labor force grew and more people couldn\u2019t find jobs. But the labor force participation rate, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, held steady from last month. (For much of last year, unemployment declined simply because people were dropping out of the labor force).\n\nAll told, I'm mildly more optimistic about the recovery after this jobs report. Seems to suggest a continuing rather than stalling recovery. \u2014 Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) March 7, 2014\n\nThis report is being heralded as fairly good news. Our own Solman Scale would agree. Our \u201cU-7\u201d calculation of unemployment, which adds to the officially unemployed everyone who says they want a job and can\u2019t find one and those who are employed part-time for economic reasons, came in at 14.58 percent. Our expanded pool of folks looking for a job is the lowest its been since we started calculating it: 23,590,000 people.\n\nBut there\u2019s a more sobering number in this report, too. The number of long-term unemployed increased by 203,000. There are now 3.8 million people who have been unemployed for 27 weeks or longer.\n\nDavid Wessel puts the long, long-term unemployed population in perspective:\n\nBLS: 2.76 million have been out of work for a full year or more, and are still looking for work. As many people as live in Chicago. \u2014 David Wessel (@davidmwessel) March 7, 2014\n\nIf those people were counted in the labor force, the unemployment rate would be much higher, as the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute demonstrates in this graph:\n\nThis is your monthly reminder that the unemployment rate is vastly understating weakness in today's labor market. pic.twitter.com/of9IxYRTL7 \u2014 Economic Policy Inst (@EconomicPolicy) March 7, 2014\n\nAnd of course, part of the reason there\u2019s a sigh of relief about February\u2019s report is because January\u2019s and December\u2019s payroll numbers were so low. Initial reports had firms posting 74,000 and 113,000 jobs in December and January respectively. (Those figures have been collectively revised upward by 25,000.)\n\nOne argument is that the icy snap and quirky seasonal adjustments are the culprits behind those weak gains. But as the BLS notes (see question 8), weather is more likely to influence hours worked than aggregate employment. Individuals would have to be off work without pay for the entire pay period to affect payroll numbers. In the household survey, which determines the unemployment rate, workers who miss work because of weather during the reference week are counted as employed, regardless of whether they were paid. Indeed, 6.9 million people reported working part-time because of weather in February \u2014 the highest February number since it was first calculated in 1978.\n\nAnd we may not be out of the cold yet. The New York Times\u2019 Nelson Schwartz writes that some economists aren\u2019t expecting so-called \u201cclean data\u201d until spring.\n\nRegardless, February\u2019s decent report suggests the Fed will continue tapering on course, most likely announcing another $10 billion drawdown of monthly bond purchases at their Open Market Committee meeting later this month.\n\nEconomists always caution not to read too deeply into any one month\u2019s report. For more about why we shouldn\u2019t obsess too much over these statistics, watch Paul Solman\u2019s conversation with Zachary Karabell, author of \u201cThe Leading Indicators: A Short History of the Numbers That Rule Our World,\u201d and read Karabell\u2019s telling of the origins of the BLS\u2019 monthly report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The economy added 175,000 jobs last month, a relief after anemic growth earlier this winter.
