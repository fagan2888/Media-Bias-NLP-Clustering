He discovered what he didn\u2019t know. What he couldn\u2019t know. Because the law would not let him.\n\nFerch, a Boise chiropractor, had received notice from Regence BlueShield of Idaho that the health insurance company was cutting back its payments for \u201cadjustments\u201d - his most common procedure - to 1990s levels.\n\nFerch and a handful of fellow chiropractors met with the medical director for Regence. Ferch asked whether the medical director\u2019s salary was the same as it had been in the 1990s. The room went silent, Ferch says, and he decided to track down exactly how much Regence paid its leadership.\n\nBut Ferch learned that health insurers in Idaho do not have to follow the same rules as nonprofit health organizations such as the St. Luke\u2019s and Saint Alphonsus systems, or for-profit publicly held health insurers such as Aetna.\n\nWhen Regence and Blue Cross of Idaho say they are nonprofit, they do not mean they are the kind of federally tax-exempt charities most people think of as nonprofits. They are mutual insurance companies beholden to policyholders instead of profit-seeking shareholders.\n\nUnlike nonprofit hospitals, Idaho\u2019s nonprofit insurers pay taxes on property, and they are not exempt from federal taxes. They also do not have to take all customers regardless of ability to pay.\n\nBut, like charitable nonprofits, they get a large share of their money directly or indirectly from government support. And they get what can amount to a large tax break: paying premium taxes of 1.5 percent instead of any other state or local tax except for property. (The premium tax is not a guaranteed break: If the insurer loses money, it still must pay premium taxes.)\n\nIn Idaho, mutual insurance companies also differ from federal tax-exempt nonprofits in that they do not tell the public what they pay their leaders. Idaho law forbids regulators from divulging that information.\n\nThe companies file reports to the Idaho Department of Insurance each year showing what they pay their top executives and board members. The department has denied the Idaho Statesman\u2019s request for the documents each year for at least three years, saying they are specifically exempted from public records laws - and have been for decades.\n\nBut most of Idaho\u2019s neighboring states do release those forms. So any member of the public can find out what CEOs make at four of the five insurance companies that sell policies on the Your Health Idaho exchange. Blue Cross of Idaho - the only Idaho-based insurer on the exchange, the largest insurer in the state, and the company Idaho pays to manage its government-employee health benefits - is the lone exception.\n\nThose four Idaho exchange insurers paid as much as $760,000 in salaries and bonuses to CEOs in 2014. Most did not pay board members. Disclosures have not yet been filed for 2015.\n\nIn neighboring states, insurance companies paid CEOs up to $2.1 million and board members up to $122,000 in 2014.\n\nIf the insurance form was public in Idaho, it would reveal how much Blue Cross of Idaho and Regence BlueShield of Idaho paid their top executives and board members in recent years. Current board members include hospital CEOs, physicians and executives in charge of some of Idaho\u2019s largest employers.\n\nBlue Cross and Regence BlueShield declined to voluntarily give the Idaho Statesman copies of their forms.\n\n\u201cAs a private, not-for-profit, taxpaying company, we do not share salaries or our compensation ranges for any employees or advisers,\u201d said Josh Jordan, a spokesman for Blue Cross of Idaho.\n\nRegence and its sister company that sells on Idaho\u2019s exchange, BridgeSpan, pays its employees and executives compensation that \u201cis rigorously reviewed and market appropriate,\u201d said spokesman Lou Riepl. \u201cAny incentive compensation is based on performance to ensure we\u2019re achieving our mission of providing high-quality, cost-effective care for our members.\u201d\n\nBut he said the company would not release compensation records.\n\n\u201cFor market competitiveness reasons and out of respect for the privacy rights of our employees - as well as our executives and board members - we keep compensation information confidential,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nTRANSPARENCY THE GOAL\n\nSome lawmakers over the years have made attempts to pry open that information in Idaho.\n\nAdvocates say the companies should be accountable for how they spend policyholders\u2019 money. They also point to other taxpayer-supported sectors where paychecks are a public record, such as government. Idaho\u2019s largest nonprofit hospitals and its publicly traded companies each year file public reports showing what they pay top executives and employees.\n\nShortly after Ferch learned of the public records exemption, he reached out to state Rep. Thomas Dayley, a Republican. Ferch had an ax to grind, but his complaint still resonated with Dayley.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily that it\u2019s right or wrong what they\u2019re doing; it\u2019s just that it\u2019s useful to have that information available to the public,\u201d Dayley told the Statesman. \u201cIf they want it, they can go and look at it. \u2026 It fits the scenario of transparency that most people like.\u201d\n\nDayley, then in his first two-year term representing Southwest Boise and part of Meridian, introduced legislation in 2014 to make compensation records available to everyone. It survived a committee vote but died after that.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t get an overwhelmingly positive response,\u201d Dayley said, noting that he did not market the bill aggressively to colleagues in the Legislature. \u201cAs a matter of fact, it was printed with only one vote - it was a one-vote margin.\u201d\n\nHe was not the first to pitch the idea. Former Sen. Charles Coiner, a Twin Falls Republican, introduced a similar bill in 2009. Coiner told the Statesman that he, too, had not pushed the bill as hard as he should have.\n\nThe lack of disclosure \u201cdoesn\u2019t seem fair to me,\u201d Coiner said.\n\nHe also questioned whether nonprofit insurers merited that status.\n\n\u201cMy contention was: If it looks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it\u2019s a duck,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it looks like a for-profit and it acts like a for-profit, then it is a for-profit. Then the question becomes: For whose profit? We should know.\u201d\n\nDayley has not decided whether to reintroduce a bill in this session, but he has heard from people who support the idea.\n\nOne supporter is Steve Ackerman, a professor of economics at the College of Western Idaho.\n\n\u201cThe goal is not to reveal the salary. The goal is to demonstrate whether the salary brings the value it should,\u201d Ackerman said. \u201c(We need) some kind of disclosure.\u201d\n\n___\n\nDISCLOSURE CAN PROMPT ACTION\n\nIdaho\u2019s insurance regulators cannot limit executive compensation. The federal Affordable Care Act introduced a cap on administrative overhead but not on salaries and bonuses.\n\nIn states where compensation is a public record, critics have accused insurers of overpaying their CEOs.\n\nThe parent company of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Montana was sued in 2014 over allegations of hoarding profits and overpaying its executives.\n\nThe Boston Globe reported that former Liberty Mutual CEO Ted Kelly had been paid $200 million over four years, based on the same types of disclosures that are sealed from the public in Idaho.\n\nAfter the Globe\u2019s investigation, Kelly stepped down as chairman in 2013, and the Massachusetts insurance department launched a wide-ranging review of how insurers paid their executives, among other changes.\n\n___\n\nPUBLIC RECORDS EXCEPTION\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the health insurance industry was going through changes, and Idaho revamped its statutes. Then-state Sen. Dean Cameron, a Rupert Republican who owned an insurance agency, was involved in that process. He helped cement the exemption in Idaho\u2019s law books.\n\nBlue Cross of Idaho backed legislation then to convert its legal status to what it is now - a \u201cmutual insurance company.\u201d The Legislature in 1995 approved that change.\n\nCameron was the floor sponsor for legislation in 1996 that, he recalls, simply made a technical correction by carrying over a law that already made secret any documents about what insurance companies paid top leaders.\n\nWhile the House Business Committee was considering that legislation and others related to the legal conversion, a representative of Regence BlueShield of Idaho \u201cthanked the Idaho Legislature for helping to create and foster a positive business environment in the state and for promoting a collaborative relationship between government and industry,\u201d according to minutes from the January 1996 committee meeting.\n\nNow that he is director of the state\u2019s Insurance Department, Cameron told the Statesman that he cannot offer opinions about whether compensation should be a public record.\n\nCoiner, the former senator, is happy to offer his.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re holding yourself out as a nonprofit, there should be daylight and clarity on how you\u2019re operating,\u201d Coiner said. \u201cIt bothered me that Blue Cross - I have no idea what they were paying their board, I have no idea what they were paying their executives. \u2026 We shouldn\u2019t have these little enclaves of special privileges for certain nonprofits. It should be a level playing field for all nonprofits.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Idaho Statesman, http://www.idahostatesman.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "To hear Gregory Ferch tell it, the meeting was a moment of clarity.
