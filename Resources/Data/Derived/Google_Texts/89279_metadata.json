Upon their return to the United States, all volunteers will be placed in mandatory quarantine in an effort to best prevent the further spread of Ebola.\n\nOn Sunday, the World Health Organization reported that the number of Ebola cases in West Africa has reached 1,825. Following this news, Christian aid groups SIM USA and Samaritan\u2019s Purse announced that they will transport an undisclosed number of their remaining volunteers working in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea back to the United States, Reuters reported.\n\nHealth officials in North Carolina have requested that all returning missionaries be placed in quarantine as a precaution against the virus\u2019s spread. \"This measure is being taken out of an abundance of caution, and it is important to remember that there are no confirmed or suspected cases of Ebola in North Carolina,\" explained Dr. Stephen Keener, medical director in North Carolina\u2019s Mechlenburg County. The quarantine is described as a \u201cpublic-health measure to protect the public.\u201d It must be stressed that one does not need to display signs of sickness to be placed in a quarantine facility. Quarantine is designed for \u201chealthy people who were exposed to a disease,\u201d said Keener, Reuters reported.\n\nThe average delay between exposure to Ebola and onset of the disease is estimated to be between eight to 10 days. However, in the rarest cases the virus can remain undisclosed for up to three weeks. Due to this, it has been decided that the returning missionaries will remain in quarantine for 21 days to best ensure both their own safety and the public\u2019s. During this time period they will be continuously monitored for symptoms of Ebola, such as fever, muscle pain, vomiting, and weakness.\n\nThe charities and their volunteers have been briefed on the quarantine requirements and are reportedly all on board. \u201cWe will continue to cooperate and collaborate with them and adhere strictly to their guidelines in the return of our missionaries to the United States,\" Bruce Johnson SIM USA president said in a statement.\n\nDr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writbol, the two first two American Ebola patients, were working through SIM USA and Samaritan\u2019s Purse when they became infected with Ebola. The two are being held at the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Ga., where both are showing signs of improvement, International Business Times reported. They are currently being kept in isolation, allowed contact with their family through a glass pane.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ebola, outbreak, forces, us, bring, missionaries, working, west, africa, home, 21, day", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "North Carolina mandates that returning charity workers be placed in a 21-day quarantine for possible Ebola exposure upon arrival to the United States.", "title": "Coming To The US From Ebola-Stricken West Africa?
