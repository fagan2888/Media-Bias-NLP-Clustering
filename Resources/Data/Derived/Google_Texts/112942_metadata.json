Her daughter walked through it just once after Adam Lanza\u2019s attack, in what at the time launched a national movement for stricter federal requirements for background checks on gun buyers.\n\n\u201cThat was my mother\u2019s sacred ground,\u201d Erica Lafferty said in a telephone interview. \u201cEvery time I step through those doors in a school, it doesn\u2019t matter which one, any random school, I\u2019m overwhelmed.\u201d\n\nThe 2013 gun control effort failed in Congress, so Lafferty and the organization she now works for \u2014 Everytown for Gun Safety \u2014 are waging a state-by-state battle to get governors and legislatures to expand background checks.\n\nThat campaign is now active in Nevada ahead of the Nov. 4 midterm election, part of a much larger national trend of outside groups bypassing Washington to achieve the same policy goals by spending millions of dollars to back their chosen candidates in local and state elections.\n\nEverytown\u2019s founder, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, for example, is putting $50 million behind the gun background check effort in its first year, including generous contributions to lawmakers around the country who back the cause.\n\nIn the Silver State, Everytown donated the maximum $10,000 to state Sen. Justin Jones, D-Las Vegas, who is running for re-election in Senate District 9. During the 2013 session, Jones backed a bill to require background checks in gun sales between private parties. It passed the Legislature but was vetoed by GOP Gov. Brian Sandoval.\n\nEverytown also donated $200,000 to the Nevada Democratic Party, which used it to air a TV ad targeting Jones\u2019 opponent, Republican Becky Harris.\n\nLafferty also plans to be in Las Vegas on Oct. 28 to make get-out-the-vote calls for Jones.\n\n\u201cWe definitely need to support him for being such a leader on this issue,\u201d Lafferty said. \u201cLast year, right after Newtown, I as well as thousands of other Americans, pushed for more background checks. But Congress is super broken, which is why we had to take it to the states. I know the long-lasting pain that gun violence can leave on a family.\u201d\n\nEric Herzik, chair of the political science department at University of Nevada, Reno, said he\u2019s noticed the growing prevalence of outside groups putting money into local and state elections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s increasing and that\u2019s not just in Nevada,\u201d Herzik said. \u201cWhat\u2019s also increasing is how far down the ballot, in a sense, outside groups now go. You used to see it, yes, for a U.S. Senate race, and a congressional race. Now you\u2019re into state legislative races.\u201d\n\nHerzik said it\u2019s hard to say whether the tactic works.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost a question of how effective these groups are. You can spend a lot of money, but the return for these groups in terms of do they really influence a race and turn it around \u2014 that remains to be seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cRarely are these groups grassroots,\u201d he added. \u201cThese are just big money fronts. Democrats do it. Republicans do it.\u201d\n\nMORE MONEY\n\nNevada campaign finance reports and TV ad buys show far more money than ever before is pouring into Nevada to sway several state races.\n\nThe biggest target is the attorney general\u2019s race between Democrat Ross Miller and Republican Adam Laxalt. Both campaigns have raised significant cash from out-of-state donors but that only tells part of the story.\n\nEach candidate is backed by a national political action committee flooding TV with campaign ads. One reason: The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Opponents of the nationwide health care law, who have been stymied in Washington, D.C., see an opening to challenge the law on the state level as attorneys general lead the legal fight to unravel it.\n\nThe Washington-based Republican Attorneys General Association has spent nearly $2.5 million on advertising in the Nevada race, including a recurring television ad targeting Miller for his support of Obamacare.\n\nOn the other side, the Silver State Committee for Justice &Fairness has spent at least $1 million on advertising, including TV ads centered on a scathing job review of Laxalt\u2019s work at a Las Vegas law firm. That PAC is completely funded by the Denver-based Democratic Attorneys General Association.\n\nHerzik said the big spending is aimed at cutting short the political career of Miller, who hopes to follow in the footsteps of his father, former Nevada Gov. Bob Miller.\n\n\u201cCertain individuals seem to draw the ire of particular groups and so some of the outside money being spent against Ross Miller, it\u2019s like \u2018let\u2019s try to take out Ross Miller, not just for attorney general but to put a ding to his political career,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nIn the race to replace Miller as secretary of state, the Democrat-backed iVote Fund has spent $600,000, almost all of it in advertising, in support of Democrat Kate Marshall in her race against Republican Barbara Cegavske.\n\nThe PAC, which has run ads against Cegavske, has identified Nevada as one of four battleground states in the growing partisan fight over election and voter registration issues, such as requiring identification at the polls. Cegavske backs voter ID laws while Marshall opposes them, saying they limit ballot access for some voters.\n\nAs for the Nevada Senate, it\u2019s getting extra attention from inside and outside the state because Republicans are trying to take control of the body, now run by Democrats with an 11-10 seat edge. Three swing races hold the key to control.\n\nLeading the fight for the Republicans is the Nevada Jobs Coalition PAC, which has spent more than $1 million on political ads, many targeting Jones in Senate District 9 and Marilyn Dondero Loop in Senate District 8.\n\nNevada Jobs Coalition is largely funded by Gov. Sandoval\u2019s New Nevada PAC, but one-fifth of its campaign cash came from the Republican State Leadership Committee. The national group, which supports GOP candidates running for statewide office, has donated about $200,000.\n\nDemocrats have their own deep-pocket allies from beyond the Silver State, including the Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund and union group UNITE Here, which spent $50,000 on neighborhood canvassers in support of Jones. The state Democratic Party also has pumped out more than $600,000 in political advertising, much of it on ads targeting Harris and Dondero Loop\u2019s Republican opponent, Patricia Farley.\n\nAnd numerous Democratic candidates across the state have received cash from U.S. Sen. Harry Reid\u2019s Searchlight Leadership Fund, which has funneled $329,000 in donations from throughout the country to Democratic committees and candidates in Nevada.\n\n\u2018BIG IDEAS\u2019 CLOSE TO HOME\n\nAnd those dollar figures will rise just before Election Day.\n\nThe State Government Leadership Foundation, a subsidiary of the Republican State Leadership Committee, ran at least 353 television ads targeting Miller, according to the non-partisan Center for Public Integrity, which has been tracking outside spending at the state level.\n\nThe Republican State Leadership committee, meanwhile, has spent at least $15,700 on ads targeting Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, D-Las Vegas, in the lieutenant governor race. She\u2019s running against state Sen. Mark Hutchison, R-Las Vegas, who is backed by Sandoval. Meanwhile, the Latino Victory PAC aired a Spanish-language ad to support Flores.\n\nThe State Government Leadership Foundation\u2019s website said it believes \u201cthe big ideas that will solve America\u2019s problems are going to be found in state capitols and not Washington, D.C.\u201d\n\nThe nonprofit foundation doesn\u2019t have to disclose its donors because it is registered with the Internal Revenue Service as a \u201csocial welfare\u201d organization. It also can receive unlimited contributions. The group is aligned with several GOP organizations, including the Republican Attorneys General Association, and typically targets Democrats.\n\nA former Miller aide filed an elections integrity complaint against the group in March, saying it must register with the Nevada secretary of state\u2019s office and disclose its political donors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing these outside state groups get involved because it\u2019s easier to get policy made at the state level,\u201d said Pete Quist, research director for the National Institute on Money in State Politics, which tracks independent spending in state races.\n\nThat includes ballot measures for issues such as renewable energy standards and legalization of marijuana, he said.\n\nErica Lafferty, whose mother died at Newtown, said she\u2019s not active only in Nevada this election cycle. She\u2019s also working for re-election of the current Connecticut governor because he approved stricter background checks. And she plans to travel to Washington state ahead of Election Day to promote a gun control ballot measure there.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like background checks are going to stop every single gun death,\u201d Lafferty said. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good start.\u201d\n\nJones said he\u2019s grateful for any help he can get. He said a recent poll shows 86 percent of Nevadans support expanding background checks. He said he isn\u2019t giving up and in fact believes it\u2019s easier to change policy at the state level than in Washington, where gridlock is more prevalent.\n\n\u201cHopefully we can come up with a compromise,\u201d he said of his proposed legislation, which he vowed to re-introduce if re-elected. \u201cI think we do a better job in Nevada of working across the aisle to get things done.\u201d\n\nContact Laura Myers at lmyers@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2919.
