Millennials are not only a major force as voters, but the massive generation now comprises the majority of the American workforce. And one thing all workers take note of -- all of the deductions from our paychecks. We\u2019re all paying into the Social Security system; the question is: What will we receive in return tomorrow for every dollar that\u2019s taken out of our paycheck today? And when do we get our money back?\n\nRepublican presidential candidates are already stirring voters with talk of raising the national retirement age. Presidential candidate and Florida Governor Jeb Bush says Social Security benefits need to be delayed to age 68 or 70.\n\n\u201cSo people that already have the supplemental retirement system, which is a contract, I don't think we violate that. For people that are about ready to be beneficiaries of their supplemental retirement, I don't think we change that,\u201d Bush said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cBut we need to look over the horizon and begin to phase in, over an extended period of time, going from [age] 65 to 68 or 70. And that by itself will help sustain the retirement system for anybody under the age of 40.\u201d\n\nRelated: As Hillary\u2019s Numbers Dip, Benghazi Rises As an Issue\n\nCurrently, the \u201cnormal retirement age\u201d for full Social Security benefits is age 65 for those born in 1937 or before. For those born in 1938 and later, it rises in two-month increments -- to age 66 for those born from 1943 to 1954, and 67 for those born in 1960 or later. \u201cEarly retirement\u201d for all Social Security recipients, with benefits reduced by as much as 30%, can begin at age 62.\n\nBush is not alone in suggesting a fundamental change to Social Security. In a large, and growing, field of Republican contenders, most are calling for boosting the retirement age. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie proposes a normal retirement age of 69 -- with early retirement benefits delayed to age 64. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida has floated similar increases.\n\nRand Paul is also in favor of raising the retirement age, but only for younger workers. And like most Republicans, he favors \u201cmeans testing\u201d \u2013 a reduction in Social Security benefits for the wealthy.\n\n\u201cDuring my time in the Senate, I have worked on proposals that would fix the shortfalls in the Social Security program through a gradual increase in theage of full retirement and by means testing yearly earnings, while preserving those benefits for near and current retirees,\u201d Paul says in a statement on his website. \u201cThese changes would only apply to younger Americans who have time to plan for the future.\u201d\n\nBut Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee is proposing a change to how Social Security is funded, rather than when benefits can be taken. On the campaign trail in Orlando yesterday, he made his opposition to raising the national retirement age clear.\n\nRelated: How to Fix the Broken Disability Insurance System\n\n\u201cThe concept that we\u2019re going to go in and tell people, after they\u2019ve involuntarily paid money into a system \u2013 for which they had no choice \u2013 and the government told them, \u2018If you let us take this money out your checks for all these many years \u2013 50 years of your work \u2013 here are the benefits that will be waiting at the end of the rainbow,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cAnd then, after they\u2019ve worked 40 or 50 years, tell them, \u2018Well, you know what, we just miscalculated the whole thing, and we not only stole from you, but now we\u2019re going to lie to you. That is a recipe not only for political suicide, but that is a recipe for economic suicide.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in April Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton said that there had been a lot of \u201cloose talk\u201d about Social Security.\n\n\u201cThe Social Security trust fund, according to the trustees, will be solvent until 2035,\u201d Clinton said at a New Hampshire campaign stop. \u201cSo what do we do to make sure it is there, and we do not mess with it, and we do not pretend that it is a luxury because it is not a luxury. It is a necessity for the majority of people who draw from Social Security. So I think there will be some big political arguments about Social Security.\u201d\n\nRather than suggesting Social Security cutbacks, Clinton faces pressure from liberal Democrats who wish to expand benefits. So far, she has refused to indicate a move in either direction.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Main Street.\n\nRead more from Main Street:\n\nOnly 6 of the 50 Best Restaurants in the World are in the U.S.\n\nThese 15 Billion-Dollar Brands Are the Most Valuable in the U.S.\n\n15 Totally Wacky Things You Can Buy at Wal-Mart", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Social Security is", "title": "Who\u2019s Afraid of Social Security Reform?
