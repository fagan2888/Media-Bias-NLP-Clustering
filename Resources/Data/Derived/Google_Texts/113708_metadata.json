In all, Medicare estimates the penalties will cost hospitals $364 million.\n\nThe penalties, part of the Affordable Care Act, are the toughest sanctions Medicare has taken on hospital safety.\n\nEach year, Medicare also docks the pay of hospitals with too many patients coming back within a month, and it doles out bonuses and penalties to hospitals based on patient satisfaction scores, death rates and other performance measures.\n\nThis second round of the Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program was based on the government\u2019s assessment of the frequency of infections in patients with central lines inserted into veins, urinary catheters and incisions from colon surgeries and hysterectomies in 2013 and 2014. Those infection rates account for 75 percent of Medicare\u2019s evaluation.\n\nThe rest is based on eight other complications including surgical tears, collapsed lungs, broken hips and reopened wounds between July 2012 and June 2014. Most of these complications were part of last year\u2019s penalty assessments, but the infections from colon operations and hysterectomies were added to the calculations this year.\n\nCongress exempted veterans\u2019 hospitals, children\u2019s hospitals and critical access hospitals from the list.\n\ndallabaugh@citizensvoice.com, 570-821-2115", "article_metadata": {"author": "By Denise Allabaugh", "title": "Geisinger Wyoming Valley hit with Medicare penalty", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "By Denise Allabaugh", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1982324"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "DC.title": "Geisinger Wyoming Valley hit with Medicare penalty"}, "article_summary": "Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center in Plains Township is among 758 hospitals Medicare is penalizing for higher rates of patient safety incidents, according to Medicare records released late Wednesday.\nCongress exempted veterans\u2019 hospitals, children\u2019s hospitals and critical access hospitals from the list.\nThe penalties, part of the Affordable Care Act, are the toughest sanctions Medicare has taken on hospital safety.\nIn all, Medicare estimates the penalties will cost hospitals $364 million.\nWendy Wilson, a spokeswoman for Geisinger Health System, said Geisinger tracks patient safety incidents internally and has already begun to address some of the issues before the report was released."}
