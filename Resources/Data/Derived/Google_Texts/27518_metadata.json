U.S. History framework that has been introduced by the College Board, headed by David Coleman, the \u201carchitect\u201d of the Common Core standards. No vote was ever taken on the proposal.\n\nTeachers also held a strike, which they called a \u201csickout,\u201d that resulted in the shutdown of two schools.\n\nThe next school board meeting is scheduled for October 2, but no vote is planned on the APUSH proposal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Threats Against Children of Colorado School Board Members Investigated", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Threats Against Children of Colorado School Board Members Investigated", "title": "Threats Against Children of Colorado School Board Members Investigated - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/09/27/school-board-threat-Fox31.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/09/27/threats-against-children-of-colorado-school-board-members-investigated/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Threats Against Children of Colorado School Board Members Investigated", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/09/27/school-board-threat-Fox31.jpg", "title": "Threats Against Children of Colorado School Board Members Investigated - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Common Core, FOX, Unions,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Unions", "published_time": "2014-09-27T10:47:35-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb42f\"", "article_summary": "The next school board meeting is scheduled for October 2, but no vote is planned on the APUSH proposal.\n\u201cIf anything, it\u2019s going to strengthen my resolve that this culture has to change.\u201dInvestigators are also looking into a case involving another school board member\u2019s children as well, says Fox 31.\nFox 31 states that, according to a Lakewood police report, a JeffCo school district employee confessed to the vandalism and was put on paid administrative leave for two weeks.\nU.S. History framework that has been introduced by the College Board, headed by David Coleman, the \u201carchitect\u201d of the Common Core standards.\n\u201cI will go into the board room and I will hold to my core principles,\u201d he asserted."}
