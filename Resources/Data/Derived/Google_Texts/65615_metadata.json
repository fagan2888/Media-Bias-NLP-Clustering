With so much white noise, it\u2019s harder to not only get the right information out there regarding legislation but also to clarify it and what it means for businesses. Sharing legal resources can help alleviate some of that noise.\n\n\u201cOur theme is how does one plus one equal three?\u201d Anton said. \u201cThey\u2019re both strong organizations. They\u2019ve both grown over the last few years. So the real question became, how do we get to the point where the sum is greater than the parts?\u201d\n\nOn a national level, organizations representing the restaurant and lodging industries combined forces last month for a joint Hill day.\n\nA thousand stakeholders from The National Restaurant Association and American Hotel & Lodging Association helped raise awareness among lawmakers on issues such as the need for reforms to the Affordable Care Act, protecting the franchise model, and enacting other pro-business policies to promote job growth.\n\nShare this article", "article_metadata": {"description": "Realizing they are stronger together than apart, the two groups recently announced an upcoming merger that will help them advocate together.", "pocket-site-verification": "f7059b70f081a1e1ced322fc1d9787", "og": {"site_name": "Associations Now", "description": "Realizing they are stronger together than apart, the two groups recently announced an upcoming merger that will help them advocate together.", "title": "Washington Restaurant and Lodging Associations Become One", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/0504_food.jpg", "url": "http://associationsnow.com/2015/05/washington-restaurant-lodging-associations-become-one/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Associations Now", "description": "Realizing they are stronger together than apart, the two groups recently announced an upcoming merger that will help them advocate together.", "title": "Washington Restaurant and Lodging Associations Become One", "image": "http://associationsnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/0504_food.jpg", "creator": "@associationsnow", "site": "@associationsnow", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"admins": 502961619}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/AssociationsNow", "section": "Uncategorized", "published_time": "2015-05-04T15:59:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Money & Business, Restaurant and Lodging"}, "article_summary": "To work more effectively on issues affecting their collective industries, the Washington Restaurant Association and Washington Lodging Association will merge later this year.\nWashington Restaurant and Lodging Associations Become One AND What's this?\n\u201cCombining resources provides a stronger organization for our members and a stronger voice,\u201d Stan Bowman, president and CEO of the Washington Lodging Association, told The Seattle Times.\nAssociations Now Brand Connection provides opportunities for advertisers to connect with the Associations Now audience.\nA thousand stakeholders from The National Restaurant Association and American Hotel & Lodging Association helped raise awareness among lawmakers on issues such as the need for reforms to the Affordable Care Act, protecting the franchise model, and enacting other pro-business policies to promote job growth."}
