Original "Gremlins" star Zach Galligan says that the success of a "Jurassic World," a movie that is set decades after the original, has had an influence on the making of "Gremlins 3."

Galligan told an audience at London's Prince Charles Cinema on Wednesday, during a special Q&A, that he thinks the franchise won't start from scratch, thus there's a "chance" he'll likely be in the next one, which will come out more than 25 years after "Gremlins 2."

"It's not going to be a reboot," he told the audience in London, who had come out for a special screening of "Gremlins," followed by questions for Galligan, according to the BBC. "It will not be a remake in any way, shape, or form. Chris Columbus [director] has come out and said that the first film is very near and dear to his heart and as long as he is alive it will never be remade."

Galligan expanded on his statements.

"So the only thing they will be, and apparently are going to be doing, is something along the lines of like 'Jurassic World,' where it will be 30 years later," he continued.

As of now, "Jurassic World," which starred Chris Pratt, has made north of $1.6 billion worldwide, reports Box Office Mojo, and the movie picked up where the original "Jurassic Park" franchise left off.

There will be new stars but Galligan added that "some of the characters from the first one" would be in it, but that "I swear on my life, I don't know if I'm in it or not, but I think there is probably a decent chance since I'm one of the few people left standing from the first movie."

Reports of a new "Gremlins" movie started back in early 2014. In April, Deadline reported that "Goosebumps" writer Carl Ellsworth would be involved in the script.
