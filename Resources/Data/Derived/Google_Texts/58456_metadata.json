That was when Tom Downey, who led Denver\u2019s Department of Excise and Licenses and drafted Denver\u2019s first regulations for legalized recreational marijuana licenses, joined the firm as director. Jim Tarpey, a former commissioner of the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, also joined the firm that same month.\n\nToday, 12 of the firm\u2019s 34 attorneys count regulatory law among their specialties, the firm said.\n\nBoth Buescher and Jennings said they\u2019re excited to shift from the public sector to the private sector.\n\nThe two said they expect to work with clients facing a range of regulations, including businesses adjusting to the Affordable Care Act, special districts running elections, and restaurants seeking liquor licenses.\n\nBuescher said he might even advise clients as they navigate regulations that he helped to shape. As a member of the state\u2019s Oil and Gas Task Force, he advised the government on how companies building large oil rigs on public grounds should work with local authorities; now, he will work from the other side of the table, advising companies on how to observe new rules based on the task force\u2019s recommendations.\n\nBuescher served as Colorado\u2019s deputy attorney general from 2011 to 2014. Previously, he was secretary of state under former Gov. Bill Ritter from 2009 to 2011. A Democrat, Buescher served two terms as a state representative from 2005 to 2009. He received a law degree from the University of Colorado Boulder in 1974.\n\nJennings managed business licensing hearings for the city and county of Denver from 2011 to 2015. He graduated with a law degree from Villanova University School of Law in 2011.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "BusinessDen", "description": "A former Colorado secretary of state and a former Denver city attorney are leaving the public sector to expand the regulatory expertise of a local law firm.", "title": "Law firm lures pair of practiced public officials - BusinessDen", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.businessden.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Ireland-Stapleton-3-ftd.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-10T10:35:00+00:00", "url": "http://www.businessden.com/2015/11/10/law-firm-lures-pair-of-practiced-public-officials/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Law", "published_time": "2015-11-10T05:00:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-10T10:35:00+00:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4"}, "article_summary": "Law firm lures pair of practiced public officials Amy DiPierroA Denver law firm is adding a former Colorado secretary of state and an attorney that once managed the city\u2019s business licenses to its growing regulatory practice.\nJim Tarpey, a former commissioner of the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, also joined the firm that same month.\nToday, 12 of the firm\u2019s 34 attorneys count regulatory law among their specialties, the firm said.\nHe graduated with a law degree from Villanova University School of Law in 2011.\nFormer Colorado Secretary of State Bernie Buescher and a former Denver city attorney John Jennings III joined the regulatory law practice at Ireland Stapleton Pryor & Pascoe."}
