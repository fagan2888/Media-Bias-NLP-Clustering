Kasich has held office for a total of 27 years. He spent four years in the Ohio State Senate, 18 years in the U.S. House, and he has been governor of Ohio since 2011.\n\nKasich calls himself a strong conservative, but also stresses that practicality is what you get with him. He\u2019s not a bomb-thrower and talks with the matter-of-fact tone of someone who saw every kind of political problem imaginable when he was chairman of the House Budget Committee for six years.\n\n\u201cI try as best as I can to, when I see a problem, I look at it and I go fix it,\u201d he said. While fielding 20 questions in his hourlong town hall, Kasich\u2019s answers are peppered with phrases such as, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I\u2019d have to check that out,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll check it out, I\u2019ll go out and look again,\u201d \u201cMy mind is open, I just say show it to me,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m open to a discussion, but we also need to be realistic.\u201d\n\nKasich has plans to balance the federal budget in less than 10 years, saying that when he was in Washington, \u201cWe did balance the budget, we cut taxes, and when I left we had a $5 trillion projected surplus.\u201d He says that since he took over as governor of Ohio the economy has boomed and that he will apply those same tactics nationally: \u201cIt\u2019s common sense regulations, it\u2019s tax cuts to spur economic growth, and it\u2019s restraining government spending.\u201d\n\nKasich laments that his ideas to stabilize Social Security in 1998 weren\u2019t adopted \u2014 likening it to a patient going getting a bad diagnosis and, \u201cYou come back 10 years later and you say to the doctor, \u2018well, what can you do for me?\u2019 \u201d He says his Social Security fix will probably have to involve upper-income Americans receiving less in benefits. \u201cSo if somebody says they can just come and fix it and nobody has to make any sacrifices, they\u2019re not being honest.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about climate change, the practical governor showed no interest in fighting over science (\u201cI think humans do affect climate change, but the degree to which is still not certain\u201d), but instead says we need to be promoting renewable energy sources such as wind and solar and working toward \u201cachievable\u201d energy-efficiency goals and standards that won\u2019t cause job loss.\n\n\u201cWe should have been doing these things a long time ago,\u201d he says. He favors a middle ground on the issue. \u201cI think the environment is important. But I\u2019m not in favor or worshiping it, I\u2019m just in favor of taking care of it and improving it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about national security issues, Kasich says that he doesn\u2019t like the U.S. getting involved in civil wars, but with ISIS, America is facing an enemy not interested in territory per se, but in destroying Western culture.\n\n\u201cThey are intent on destroying our very way of life,\u201d he says. So, \u201cWe need to take them out. And at the same time I believe we need to communicate our values worldwide.\u201d He believes that America isn\u2019t at war with Islam. \u201cIt\u2019s just an infinitesimal number that have hijacked that religion.\u201d\n\nKasich also says there are other aspects of national security to think about, such as fighting global poverty. He notes that he worked with the singer Bono on those issues and there is more America can do.\n\n\u201cWe talk a lot about war. It\u2019s also important that we show the heart of America,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have a bomber flying over an African village, I want someone there saying, \u2018Yeah, they may be flying that bomber, but they also vaccinated my children.\u2019 \u201d\n\nEvery Republican Iowa campaign town hall features a question the Affordable Care Act, with the usual response by the candidate being that he or she would repeal it, and Kasich\u2019s answer was no different.\n\nHowever, a follow up question \u2014 in which a man said that due to a chronic illness he had never been able to get health insurance until Obamacare \u2014 elicited an answer one would not hear from most of the other GOP presidential hopefuls. For Kasich, who as governor accepted Obamacare funding to expand Medicaid in Ohio, there is a moral element to the health care issue.\n\nHe told the questioner that as president he would push to bring resources to every state to cover the working poor. Then he paused, looked down at the ground, and got angry.\n\n\u201cAre you kidding me? It could be any of us, right? No. You have a pre-existing condition, you gotta\u2019 get insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not our country!\u201d\n\nHe expanded Medicaid in Ohio, he said, \u201cso we could have the money that is necessary for the working poor, the mentally ill, for the drug addicted. I mean, you don\u2019t turn your back on those kinds of things. Because that\u2019s not the way I was raised. We just don\u2019t behave that way. We stick together. It\u2019s important that we do.\u201d\n\nIn the traditional view of American politics, Kasich\u2019s experience and gubernatorial accomplishments in the vital swing state of Ohio should be recipe for success as a presidential candidate, but so far at least, not this year.\n\nWhen I asked him if he ever would have expected the circus-like atmosphere that has permeated the race this time around, he feigned ignorance. So I rephrased the question: \u201cI mean Trump!\u201d The governor of Ohio sighed, and said, \u201cI\u2019m not caught up in it. We\u2019ll see. We have a long time to go.\u201d\n\nJohn Kasich is playing the long game. He\u2019s banking on his party reverting to a long tradition of picking a political veteran as its nominee.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, State, Opinion, Bob Beatty, Columns", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Ankeny, Iowa - John Kasich is holding a town hall in Iowa, and he says the phrase that is supposed to be the death knell for a Republican presidential candidate in 2016: \"I've been in politics a long, long time.", "title": "Bob Beatty: Kasich an old school governor from Ohio", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2016-01-16/bob-beatty-kasich-old-school-governor-ohio", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/15050413.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Ankeny, Iowa \u2014 John Kasich is holding a town hall in Iowa, and he says the phrase that is supposed to be the death knell for a Republican presidential candidate in 2016: \u201cI\u2019ve been in politics a long, long time.\u201dHe says it because he believes that being president is about more than talk, but about experience and accomplishments.\u201cI like to talk about what I have done,\u201d Kasich says, \u201cbecause I think that if I show you I\u2019ve done it a couple of times before and now I tell you I can do it again, I hope that the record of the past would convince you.\u201d"}, "article_summary": "He spent four years in the Ohio State Senate, 18 years in the U.S. House, and he has been governor of Ohio since 2011.\nSo I rephrased the question: \u201cI mean Trump!\u201d The governor of Ohio sighed, and said, \u201cI\u2019m not caught up in it.\nFor Kasich, who as governor accepted Obamacare funding to expand Medicaid in Ohio, there is a moral element to the health care issue.\nKasich calls himself a strong conservative, but also stresses that practicality is what you get with him.\nWe have a long time to go.\u201dJohn Kasich is playing the long game."}
