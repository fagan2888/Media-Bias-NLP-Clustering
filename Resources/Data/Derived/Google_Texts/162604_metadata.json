I\u2019m very thankful for he having taken such a stand on Obamacare, and many other issues. And really being able to shift some of the national debate about the issues because he\u2019s been so out there. He\u2019s been really bold.\u201d\n\nLater in the interview, she praised Scott Walker for taking on the unions, declaring \u201cwhat a soul that is when you\u2019re up against the unions. You know, most governors have had to face that with public jobs, the public employees union especially. And you don\u2019t make any friends when you take them on, just to do the right thing for your state. Walker is a great example of what it takes, and how great the success is. One of the ramifications of his \u2014 and result of his success is, people are rooting for him to become the president.\u201d Palin also said that she wants to \u201cspeak positively\u201d about the solidly conservative candidates, and \u201cWe have good candidates. There is a lot of hope in this whole lineup. And we just need to, when the time comes, unify. No candidate is perfect. We need to unify behind he or she who will represent the conservative ideals most appropriately, and beat the Democrats.\u201d\n\n(h/t The Right Scoop)\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sarah Palin Ted Cruz and Scott Walker while stating that she wishes to \"speak positively\" about the solid conservatives in the field", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Sarah Palin Ted Cruz and Scott Walker while stating that she wishes to \"speak positively\" about the solid conservatives in the field", "title": "Palin Praises Walker and Cruz, Wants To 'Speak Positively' About Solid Candidates - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/AP188948196027.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/08/01/palin-praises-walker-and-cruz-wants-to-speak-positively-about-solid-candidates/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sarah Palin Ted Cruz and Scott Walker while stating that she wishes to \"speak positively\" about the solid conservatives in the field", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/AP188948196027.jpg", "title": "Palin Praises Walker and Cruz, Wants To 'Speak Positively' About Solid Candidates - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Sarah Palin, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz,2016 Presidential Race, Breitbart TV,Palin", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ted Cruz", "published_time": "2015-08-01T11:43:12-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "One of the ramifications of his \u2014 and result of his success is, people are rooting for him to become the president.\u201d Palin also said that she wants to \u201cspeak positively\u201d about the solidly conservative candidates, and \u201cWe have good candidates.\nHe\u2019s been really bold.\u201dLater in the interview, she praised Scott Walker for taking on the unions, declaring \u201cwhat a soul that is when you\u2019re up against the unions.\nWalker is a great example of what it takes, and how great the success is.\nAnd really being able to shift some of the national debate about the issues because he\u2019s been so out there.\nAnd you don\u2019t make any friends when you take them on, just to do the right thing for your state."}
