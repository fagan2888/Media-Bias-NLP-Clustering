Hospital pharmacies will still seek assistance through 340B and other indigent-care programs, which means they need a strong partner to implement solutions and realize the benefits of these important safety-net programs,\u201d said Scott Miller, senior vice president of McKesson Health Systems. \u201cBuilding on McKesson\u2019s leading distribution capabilities, we provide in-depth expertise and a range of unique solutions to assist with indigent-care management and increase customers\u2019 confidence that they have the most cost-efficient and comprehensive programs in place.\u201d\n\nMcKesson 340B Solutions\n\nThe federal 340B Drug Pricing Program offers significant savings to the nation\u2019s safety-net providers to support the cost of serving vulnerable and low-income patients, but complying with the program\u2019s inventory management, auditing and tracking requirements can be cumbersome. McKesson offers the following services and products to support hospitals:\n\nMcKesson 340B Solutions Consulting: Many hospitals don\u2019t optimize their participation in the 340B program because regulatory compliance, management, auditing and tracking requirements are complex and resource intensive. McKesson\u2019s Pharmacy Optimization team provides consulting, implementation services and pharmacy practice resources to hospitals and health-system pharmacies to help reduce costs, improve efficiency and uncover untapped opportunities available under the 340B program. With strong consulting depth from accomplished pharmacy experts, the 340B consulting team can help navigate the complexities of 340B by providing actionable recommendations and plans to optimize program participation. Integrated with Macro Helix\u2019s industry-leading software platform, McKesson\u2019s holistic approach and operational support provide an end-to-end solution for 340B management.\n\nMany hospitals don\u2019t optimize their participation in the 340B program because regulatory compliance, management, auditing and tracking requirements are complex and resource intensive.

Integrated with Macro Helix\u2019s industry-leading software platform, McKesson\u2019s holistic approach and operational support provide an end-to-end solution for 340B management. Macro Helix 340B Architect Software: Macro Helix has helped approximately 450 community and academic hospitals serve their indigent patients while increasing operational efficiency with its sophisticated, intuitive software. The 340B Architect software provides transparent tracking, management and replenishment designed to help pharmacies maintain compliance with the 340B program. The software tracks all eligible outpatient drug utilization at the NDC and patient level, as well as 340B ordering of non-wholesaler and non-pharmacy 340B-eligible items, and easily integrates with McKesson\u2019s ordering platform, McKesson Connect. With the agility to quickly implement solutions for new rules and regulations (e.g., automated orphan drug exclusion management), to support compliance, Macro Helix helps assist with audits through standard and custom reports as well as a dedicated audit team. Macro Helix also assists eligible 340B entities in evaluating and establishing 340B contract-dispensing agreements with local and national pharmacies, including hospitals and other types of providers.\n\n\u201cWe bring extensive knowledge and support across the entire healthcare continuum, from the hospital and ambulatory setting to retail and alternate site pharmacies,\u201d said Andrew Wilson, vice president, 340B Solutions. \u201cWith deep industry experience, McKesson\u2019s 340B team can offer valuable insights and support best practices to address the broader strategic challenges that health systems are facing today.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsing Macro Helix\u2019s 340B Architect product, Carolinas HealthCare System is able to accurately identify 340B-eligible patients as well as provide information needed for an official HRSA audit and for ongoing self-audit activities. Further, McKesson has been progressive and creative in identifying new mechanisms to help us be compliant with the ever-evolving requirements of the 340B program, and has adjusted its contracting and distribution processes accordingly,\u201d said Bob Carta, vice president, division of pharmacy services, Carolinas HealthCare System. \u201cWe appreciate and regularly avail ourselves of the in-depth knowledge of McKesson\u2019s 340B team of experts. I can\u2019t imagine a better partner to optimize our financial management of the segment of our budget that consumes 80% of our resources.\u201d\n\nMcKesson MedSource\u00ae Patient Assistance Recovery Program\n\nManaging manufacturer patient-assistance programs (PAPs) is time consuming and requires staying current with program requirements and various enrollment processes. McKesson\u2019s MedSource program reduces the time, cost and hassle for hospitals by combining a dedicated PAP recovery manager with proprietary software and tools for tracking, reporting and managing hospitals\u2019 participation in the programs. MedSource works seamlessly with legacy hospital-pharmacy and accounting systems, so it complements existing workflow and processes.\n\n\u201cI continue to be impressed and appreciative of MedSource\u2019s success in recovering costs incurred with our non-resource patient population. With the growing number of patients in our area who need healthcare services but lack insurance and/or financial resources, the service of the MedSource program is needed more than ever,\u201d said Marshall Steglich, director of pharmacy, Houston Northwest Medical Center. \u201cRecouping the money allows our facility to continue to provide service to underinsured patients while making the monthly operating picture a bit less negative. I also appreciate the monthly reports illustrating the dollars that were recovered.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarolinas HealthCare System has a commitment to serve all patients regardless of their ability to pay, and McKesson is a crucial partner in facilitating that mission,\u201d said Bob Carta. \u201cMcKesson assists Carolinas HealthCare System in stretching healthcare resources to serve as many indigent patients as possible through these important programs.\u201d\n\nAbout McKesson\n\nMcKesson Corporation, currently ranked 14th on the FORTUNE 500, is a healthcare services and information technology company dedicated to making the business of healthcare run better.
