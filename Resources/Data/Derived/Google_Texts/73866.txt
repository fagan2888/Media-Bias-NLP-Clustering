There have been rumors that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is the villain of the newly titled "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" for some time now, and if the latest is true, he might not be able to help himself from turning evil.



According to Making Star Wars, in the new film, Luke has realized his Jedi powers had grown so strong he could no longer control them. To keep the universe safe, he's placed himself in exile and has become "deranged" after so many years in solitude.



He'll spend the film on the cusp of both good and evil, and "the villain and the new hero both draw Skywalker out and he’s forced to intervene in the galactic conflict." We'll know which side he's picked by the final act of the film.



He's described as "creepy and frightening in appearance," with "fire in his eyes."

It was previously reported that Luke would play a villainous role, but didn't have the exact nature. Of course, any rumors we hear about the film need to be taken with a grain of salt until we see a trailer. Even then, we can only make assumptions from a teaser up to a certain point.



Do you think Luke will go over to the Dark Side or manage to stay good?



"Star Wars: The Force Awakens" premieres December 18, 2015. Read the film's latest news HERE.
