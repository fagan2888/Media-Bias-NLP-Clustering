She said the plan had been dropped due, in part, to difficulties with HealthCare.gov that have truncated Obamacare recruitment efforts at all levels.\n\nThe co-founder of PolicyMic, Chris Altchek, strenuously denied the idea was ever discussed in the course of crafting the contest, denied Plank ever made the comments in the first place, and said Plank was not in any of the initial discussions about how the contest would come together. Plank appeared on MSNBC Wednesday to explain the contest.\n\nThe White House never heard of the free health care idea, and a top official said the notion it was ever under consideration is \u201cdead wrong.\u201d Altchek said \u201cdevelopment of the contest was entirely internal to PolicyMic.\u201d\n\nPlank also denies she ever mentioned the free health care idea at the New York meeting, but a text message conversation with a BuzzFeed reporter this week appeared to confirm that the free health care idea had been considered.\n\nOn Wednesday, as the final version program was being announced as part of a White House \u201cYouth Summit,\u201d BuzzFeed\u2019s Benny Johnson asked about the free health care plan in a text message to Plank.\n\n\u201cIs the prize for the winner still healthcare [sic]?\u201d Johnson asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different now, because of website problem,\u201d Plank replied. \u201cSo now ppl [sic] with the most upvoted proposals get a response from the white house [sic].\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the plan was to subsidize the winners [sic] ACA plan but now the winner gets a personalized message from the WH?\u201d Johnson asked.\n\n\u201cOui!\u201d Plank replied.\n\n\u201cLiz did not play any role in developing the ACA contest,\u201d Altchek said. Her current role is as a face of the contest, through, \u201cworking with the team to promote the contest on social media and television.\u201d\n\nThe final version of the contest, announced Wednesday, calls on users of the site to \u201cShare an idea, project, or proposal for what our generation and the White House can do to make health care work for young people and get them educated about the ACA.\u201d The top \u201cthree most mic\u2019d submissions will receive responses from the White House,\u201d the site reads.\n\nThe PolicyMic contest runs from Dec. 3 through Dec. 11. Winners will get some kind of response from the White House, PolicyMic says.\n\nAs with many outreach efforts originally designed to help launch the Affordable Care Act, the contest was shortened and revised after the stumbling roll out of HealthCare.gov. Altchek described a grander vision for a contest that would actually fund initiatives to educate young people about the Affordable Care Act and urge them to buy insurance.\n\n\u201cFree health care\u201d was never part of those discussions, Altchek said.\n\n\u201cIn September, PolicyMic started brainstorming how we might construct a contest that would engage as many millennials as possible in learning more about health care reform. One of the options we considered was providing a grant to the winning participants to implement their outreach plan that would subsidize their efforts,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has never been any discussion at PolicyMic internally or externally about any other option other than that format or the current one.\u201d\n\nScheduling demands caused by Obamacare website problems led to alterations.\n\n\u201cThe contest changed very little from the initial plan. Our initial vision ran into scheduling challenges when the government shutdown occurred and our contest had to be delayed,\u201d Altchek said. \u201cGiven the winter holiday, we shortened the timeline and focused on promoting a meaningful dialogue with the opportunity to receive a direct response from the White House.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"bf": {"buzzid": 2800666, "userid": 568833}, "description": "Startup PolicyMic partnered with the White House to help sell the Affordable Care Act to young people.
