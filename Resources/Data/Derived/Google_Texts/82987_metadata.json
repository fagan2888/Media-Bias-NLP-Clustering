That success is driven by a work force motivated by data-driven managers who stick to principles laid down by company founder Jeff Bezos.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the takeaway from today\u2019s New York Times story, \u201cInside Amazon: Wrestling Big Ideas in a Bruising Workplace.\u201d Based on more than 100 interviews, the story depicts a corporate culture where employees are pushed to the limit.\n\nDavid Streitfeld is one of the authors. He joins me now from San Francisco.\n\nSo, what is the culture that you found?\n\nDAVID STREITFELD, The New York Times: It is a very intense culture, a very hardworking culture, a culture where people feel they want to push themselves as far as they can, and they do.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So far, none of that, what you just said, sounds like a bad thing for a company.\n\nDAVID STREITFELD: No, it\u2019s a great thing for a company.\n\nIf you have a company of type-A performers, and they\u2019re always performing at the limits of what they can do, you can do amazing things, which Amazon indeed has.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: What do you find unique about what\u2019s happening inside Amazon\u2019s work culture?\n\nDAVID STREITFELD: The unique thing was just how well they maintained that culture of endurance and excellence.\n\nStart-ups do that sort of thing. They work all the time. And people are completely devoted to the company, and the rest of their life falls away. The unique thing with Amazon is, they had preserved, to a large extent, that start-up culture, to a company that was employing tens of thousands of people. And that\u2019s a remarkable thing to do. And I don\u2019t know of many other companies, if any, that have managed to do it.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Some of the anecdotes you write about are almost in direct opposition to the other stories about tech life that we hear, that Netflix has a yearlong maternity or paternity leave policy that they want to institute, and Google has fabulous free food everywhere.\n\nThat\u2019s not what you get when you walk into Amazon\u2019s offices.\n\nDAVID STREITFELD: That\u2019s true. Amazon is much more severe.\n\nIt in \u2014 it has a lot of technology, but, in some ways, its self-image is not of a tech company. Its self-image is as a retailer. And in the retail business, margins are very thin and benefits are comparatively less.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And you describe a situation at the \u2014 what is it, the end of every year, where they essentially cut back their employees, depending \u2014 or their lowest performers?\n\nDAVID STREITFELD: Yes, Amazon uses a technique which was relatively widespread in corporate America maybe 10 years ago \u2014 and some companies, other companies still use it now \u2014 called \u2014 the crudest name for it, which companies do not use, is rank and yank.\n\nYou decide where everyone fits, and those at the bottom, those that rank the lowest, you either encourage to leave or you could just release them.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: What did Amazon say to this as you were reporting?\n\nDAVID STREITFELD: Amazon has always prided itself on being a very tough place to work.\n\nThey have said this from the very beginning. As Jeff Bezos said very early on to new employees, it\u2019s not easy to work here. And without it being \u2014 without those high standards, you probably never would have heard of Amazon. It \u2014 it would not exist now.\n\nThe question is, for employees who are diverted by crises, what happens to them?\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: David Streitfeld, one of the co-authors of the piece from The New York Times, thanks so much.\n\nDAVID STREITFELD: Thank you.", "article_metadata": {"description": "According to a story in The New York Times, the success of Amazon.com, the world's largest retailer, is motivated by a data-driven workforce and a corporate culture where employees are pushed to the limit.
