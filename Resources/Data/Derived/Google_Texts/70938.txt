SPRINGFIELD, Mo. -- Cox College has created another way for students in the medical field to simulate real situations they'll face after graduation.

The new 900-square-foot apartment built inside Cox North is meant to look and feel like a real home. The goal is that once volunteers act as patients in the area, students will be able to practice their skills in a more realistic setting.

"Occupational therapy helps people to get back to everyday life," Todd Rutledge, Cox College's director of communications and development, says. "This allows our students to practice the safe patient skills they'll need before they're actually in a real-life environment."

The plan for the new cox cottage is to eventually let other community members inside who could also use the space. That may include paramedics, EMT's or hospice nurses.

The cottage is just the latest sort of "simulation space" to be added to the college. Those studying in degree programs such as nursing also have areas they're already practicing in, including an old critical care unit that has been transformed into the students' critical care lab.
