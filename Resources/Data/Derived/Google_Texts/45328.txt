Hillary Clinton

The Democratic winner in Iowa -- by a hair -- Hillary Clinton has stated that she would expand, and build upon, the increase in health coverage achieved by the 2010 Affordable Care Act. "“Health care is a basic right," she said on Jan. 27. "We are 90 percent covered, we gotta get to 100 percent, and then we gotta get cost down and make it work for everybody. And even though we didn't get it then, we've got it now and I'm going to defend it and improve it."

She released her affordable healthcare and prescription drug platform on Sept. 23, 2015. Under her plan, a patient could visit a doctor three times without it counting towards their annual deductible, and families ineligible for Medicare could receive up to a $5,000 tax credit for out-of-pocket healthcare expenses. She would also impose a $250 monthly cap on prescription drugs for patients with chronic or serious health conditions. Additionally, her plan would legalize prescription drug imports from Canada.

Clinton announced earlier this year that she would expand autism insurance and access to early screening. She would also seek to establish the Autism Works Initiative to increase the number of employed people with autism and to launch “the first-ever adult autism prevalence study.”

During a campaign stop in New Hampshire just before the turn of the new year, Clinton mentioned she would like to spend $2 billion on treating and preventing Alzheimer's Disease.
