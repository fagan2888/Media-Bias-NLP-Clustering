Four men were arrested in a Ventura police undercover operation targeting sexual predators on Friday, authorities said.

The operation involved an undercover female officer posing as an underage prostitute, authorities said.

The men were arrested on suspicion of meeting/soliciting a minor for sexual acts and booked into county jail, authorities said.

Authorities identified them as Scott Starting, 62; William Camp, 75; Jose Reyes, 30; and Angelito Baylon, 43. Camp is a Michigan resident, while the other three are from Ventura, police said.

During the operation, the men at various times on Friday contacted the undercover officer and made arrangements to pay for sex, authorities said. When the suspects arrived at the agreed-to location, they were found to be carrying enough cash for the sexual act and were arrested, police said.
