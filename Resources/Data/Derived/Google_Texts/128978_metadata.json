It\u2019s valued at $4.3 billion over a decade and potentially worth nearly $9 billion over 18 years, officials said.\n\nTo highlight the significance of the work, Frank Kendall, the department\u2019s top acquisition official, said he has spent more time on this program than any other \u2014 even the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Pentagon\u2019s most expensive weapons system.\n\n\u201cThis date represents an important step in the acquisition of a modern health care system for DoD,\u201d he said during a conference call with reporters earlier in the day. \u201cIt\u2019s not the final step by any means. We have a lot of work ahead of us.\u201d\n\nLeidos, based in Reston, Virginia, beat out two other finalists in part by offering a more cost-effective bid, officials said. The government contract is the largest of its kind since the one that led to the 2013 creation of the Healthcare.gov website to register individuals for health care policies under Obamacare.\n\nThe contract will modernize how the Pentagon provides care to some 9.5 million military members, families and retirees in part by installing new IT equipment and software to better share patient information with the Veterans Affairs Department and private providers, officials said.\n\nWhile the military has used electronic health records for years, many troops who deployed to warzones such as Afghanistan and Iraq had trouble accessing their medical history from base to base and resorted to storing the information on portable computer disks such as thumb drives. In other cases, they carried around paper records in manila folders.\n\n\u201cThat will be a thing of the past,\u201d Jonathan Woodson, a doctor and assistant secretary of defense for health affairs, pledged during the conference call.\n\nYet getting the new system up and running across the Pentagon\u2019s 55 military hospitals and 600 clinics will take years. The plan is to begin installing the technology at eight locations in the Pacific Northwest, then expand to the rest of the sites over six or seven years, Kendall said. The names of the initial locations weren\u2019t immediately available.\n\nLeidos partnered with Cerner Corp., a publicly traded health IT supplier based in Kansas City, Missouri, and Accenture Plc to bid for the work. Other finalist teams included Epic Systems Corp. and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc.\n\nRead the rest of the story at Military.com at http://mil-com.me/1SNq89L", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "electronic health records,frank kendall,jonathan woodson,industry", "google-site-verification": "QLyqKGiB158lZ5EhWw9IzSMv-srhpNlYmQLTBeVxc60", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "description": "The U.S. Defense Department on Wednesday awarded one of the biggest health information-technology contracts in history to Leidos Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis date represents an important step in the acquisition of a modern health care system for DoD,\u201d he said during a conference call with reporters earlier in the day.\nIt\u2019s valued at $4.3 billion over a decade and potentially worth nearly $9 billion over 18 years, officials said.\nThe government contract is the largest of its kind since the one that led to the 2013 creation of the Healthcare.gov website to register individuals for health care policies under Obamacare.\nThe U.S. Defense Department on Wednesday awarded one of the biggest health information-technology contracts in history to Leidos Inc.\nThe agreement, announced at 5 p.m. in Washington, D.C., is designed to digitize the military\u2019s medical record system for troops, their families and retirees."}
