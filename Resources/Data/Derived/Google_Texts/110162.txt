A 22-year-old Dover woman died in an early-morning crash in Valrico when the truck she was a passenger in collided with a tree on Bloomingdale Avenue, the Hillsborough County Sheriffâ€™s Office said.

At around 3:30 a.m., Parker Hagin, 21, of Valrico, was driving west approaching Cade Lane when he lost control of his Ford F-350 pickup, swerving into the median where the truck turned and struck an oak tree along the passenger side, deputies said.

His passenger, Heather L. Hinson, died at the scene. Hagin sustained minor injuries. Neither were wearing a seat belt, deputies said.

Drugs or alcohol do not appear to be a factor in the crash, deputies said.
