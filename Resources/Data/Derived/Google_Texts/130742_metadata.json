He is offering a large-scale demonstration that as the federal government grows ever larger, with ever more expansive responsibilities, it becomes increasingly dysfunctional, plagued by a culture of complacency in key agencies with no sign of serious accountability for consequential mistakes.\n\nObama and his VA secretary, Eric Shinseki, thought the VA was succeeding in reducing the backlog of veterans needing care. On Monday the nation learned that the scale of the much-covered problem was epic: \u201c57,000 veterans have been waiting more than 90 days for an appointment and . . . an additional 64,000 requested medical care but never made it onto VA waiting lists.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, President Obama announced a decision to stop deporting those who entered the country illegally under the age of 16. This was a version of one of his domestic policy goals, the DREAM Act, providing a path to citizenship to those who entered the country illegally as children.\n\nToday on the U.S. border with Mexico, the federal government is struggling to keep up with waves of unattended children crossing into this country. According to Customs and Border Protection, in the past eight months, agents have apprehended about 47,000 unaccompanied minors who crossed into the U.S. illegally from Mexico; apprehensions of minors this year may reach 90,000. Three military bases are being used as emergency housing for these minors. Some attribute the surge to increased gang violence in El Salvador and Guatemala, while others argue that Obama\u2019s 2012 decision created a strong new incentive for foreign citizens to send their children into the country illegally. There is no indication that President Obama will reverse the policy.\n\nObama trusted that his health and human services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, would tell him if Healthcare.gov wouldn\u2019t be ready by the deadline. After a humiliatingly dysfunctional launch, Healthcare.gov has cost taxpayers \u201cat least $834 million in IT spending so far, and another $200 million is being requested for fiscal 2015.\u201d The site is being completely redesigned, with new contractors, and taxpayers and insurance buyers may get a frustrating rerun next year as well:\n\nThe makeover \u2014 and the tight timeline to accomplish it \u2014 are raising concerns that consumers could face another rocky rollout this fall when they return to the site to choose health plans. Some key back-end functions, including a system to automate payments to insurers, are running behind schedule, according to a presentation federal officials made to health insurers.\n\nSeparately, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, and Oregon will spend $240 million to fix their sites or switch to the federal marketplace, a Wall Street Journal analysis shows.\n\nOf course, large-scale projects beget large-scale problems:\n\nThe government may be paying incorrect subsidies to more than 1 million Americans for their health plans in the new federal insurance marketplace and has been unable so far to fix the errors.\n\nIn each of the above cases, the highest level of our government walked around in a self-deluding fog, convinced that everything was fine, until it reached a belated realization that predictable problems had exploded into full-blown crises.\n\nBut those are just the highest-profile examples. Almost every day, the inside sections of the newspaper provide new examples of government waste, incompetence, malfeasance, or bureaucratic inertia that would be funny if we weren\u2019t all paying for it:\n\n\u2022 A General Accounting Office review concludes that the Office of Management and Budget and the vast majority of agencies do not have adequate policies for managing software licenses. One software-management firm estimates that \u201cthe US government wastes up to $2 billion per year, or 25 percent of its annual $8 billion software budget, on shelfware (unused software), under-utilized software, and non-optimized management of software licenses.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Federal employees and a contractor diverted more than $1 million of charitable contributions to spending on themselves for in-office massages, meals at every meeting, and other luxuries and unnecessary expenses.

The report found that from October 2007 through March 2013, the major defense contractor \u201cdid not properly charge labor rates\u201d for a counter-narcoterrorism contract, and that the Army agency in charge of the contract did not ensure that the people performing the work had the necessary qualifications. The agency also did not review invoices for millions of dollars of overtime, the report said.\n\n\u2022 The Small Business Health Options Program, a provision of Obamacare, did not launch this year, and the administration approved a delay for 18 states, putting off the program\u2019s launch in those states until at least 2016.\n\n\u2022 State exchanges have their embarrassments as well: \u201cA Connecticut Obamacare exchange worker has admitted to taking personal information about 400 enrollees out of the office, information that was found in a backpack left on a Hartford street last week.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Representative Darrell Issa spotlighted this maddening tale of one part of the federal government prosecuting a man for doing a job that another part had hired him to do:\n\nErnesto Pulido\u2019s Oakland, California landscape company was hired by the U.S. Postal Service to trim the trees around a parking lot for their mail trucks.

Trying to make the best of the situation, Mr. Pulido has publicly apologized for disturbing the birds and made a $2,500 contribution to a local shelter w[h]ere they were taken for treatment and recovery. But that wasn\u2019t good enough for the Fish and Wildlife Service that decided to refer Mr. Pulido for federal prosecution where he could face up to six months in jail and a $15,000 fine.\n\n\nAfter congressional ridicule and criticism, the Justice Department elected not to pursue charges against Pulido.\n\nObama is described by friends and confidants as being increasingly frustrated as his second term drags on. His frustration stems from an inability or refusal to get to the heart of his governing problem: Obama\u2019s liberal worldview depends upon the federal government to be an effective, efficient, and trustworthy tool for implementing his vision of progress, but the bureaucracy he sits atop\u00a0has its own vision: a bigger, more expensive, less accountable version of the status quo.\u00a0\n\n\u2014 Jim Geraghty writes the Campaign Spot on NRO and is the author of The Weed Agency, a comic satire of the federal bureaucracy.", "card": "summary", "title": "A Dysfunctional Government, Top to Bottom, by Jim Geraghty, National Review"}, "sailthru.date": "Wed, 2014-06-11 04:00", "robots": "follow, index", "sailthru.title": "A Dysfunctional Government, Top to Bottom", "keywords": "Jim Geraghty", "fb": {"app_id": 129250807108374}, "sailthru.tags": "A Dysfunctional Government, Top to Bottom, Jim Geraghty, National Review", "msvalidate.01": "E48498F585100158A880ED1615918208", "google-site-verification": "OOtPjyj3i8ggfSXzZ7MPoTiwFy_JnfzKMPkjZ5bhpk0", "copyright": "\u00a9 National Review, Inc.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Jim Geraghty, Politics, Nation, World"}, "article_summary": "This was a version of one of his domestic policy goals, the DREAM Act, providing a path to citizenship to those who entered the country illegally as children.\nThe agency also did not review invoices for millions of dollars of overtime, the report said.\nan additional 64,000 requested medical care but never made it onto VA waiting lists.\u201dIn 2012, President Obama announced a decision to stop deporting those who entered the country illegally under the age of 16.\nObama and his VA secretary, Eric Shinseki, thought the VA was succeeding in reducing the backlog of veterans needing care.\nSome attribute the surge to increased gang violence in El Salvador and Guatemala, while others argue that Obama\u2019s 2012 decision created a strong new incentive for foreign citizens to send their children into the country illegally."}
