The House of Representatives failed on Tuesday to override President Barack Obama's veto of a bill that would have gutted the Affordable Care Act. The bill, H.R. 3762, passed the Senate in early December and passed the House in early January, but stopped short of becoming law due to the president's veto.

The House needed a two-thirds majority to override Obama's veto, yet it came up short with a vote of 241-186--with members voting mostly along party lines. Passage of the bill itself was largely symbolic, FierceHealthPayer has reported, as Republicans expected a presidential veto but also wanted to express their opposition to the ACA and pave a legislative path for a future repeal of the law.
