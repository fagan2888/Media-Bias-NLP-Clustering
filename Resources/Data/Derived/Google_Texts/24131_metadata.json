They also blame her for running Latin America's largest economy into the ground.\n\nIn a video and a newspaper column, Rousseff \u2013 Brazil's first female president - strongly denied she had committed an impeachable crime and called the bid to oust her \"the biggest legal and political fraud\" in the country's history.\n\n\"We are facing the threat of a coup d'\u00e9tat, a coup without guns that uses more destructive methods like fraud and lies to try to destroy a legitimately elected government,\" she wrote in the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper's Saturday edition.\n\nIf her impeachment is approved by the lower house, the Senate must then vote on whether to go ahead with putting Rousseff on trial for disobeying budget laws. If she loses that vote, which would likely take place on May 10 or 11, Rousseff would automatically be suspended and replaced by Vice President Michel Temer.\n\nTemer, who would serve out Rousseff's term until 2018 if she is found guilty by the Senate, has little popular support. He would face a daunting task restoring confidence in a country where dozens of political leaders, including his close associates, are under investigation for corruption.\n\nEven if Rousseff wins Sunday's vote, her coalition has been left in tatters by the acrimonious impeachment process and analysts say her pledges to form a national unity government are unlikely to bear fruit in a bitterly divided country.\n\nA case before the Supreme Electoral Court concerning charges of illegal funding of her 2014 campaign could eventually lead to both Rousseff and Temer being dismissed from office and new elections called.\n\nIn the video posted on social media on Friday, Rousseff warned that if she is toppled by the impeachment process, a Temer government would force Brazilians to make sacrifices as well as roll back social advances that have reduced poverty during 13 years of Workers' Party rule.\n\nThe vice president, who has been preparing to form a new government aimed at restoring confidence and economic growth, replied on Twitter that accusation that he will cut social programs for the poor was a \"baseless lie.\"\n\nTemer is considering the chairman of Goldman Sachs in Brazil, Paulo Leme, and the founder of asset manager Mau\u00e1 Capital, Luiz Fernando Figueiredo, as candidates to join his economic team should he take over the presidency, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.\n\n(Writing by Anthony Boadle, editing by G Crosse)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Brazil's Rousseff scrambles for votes to avert impeachment - Reuters News:     By Marcela Ayres    .05/26/2016 20:44:04PM EST.", "author": "Reuters News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "By Marcela Ayres    BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President", "title": "Reuters News - Brazil's Rousseff scrambles for votes to avert impeachment", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/04/16/brazils-rousseff-scrambles-for-votes-to-avert-impeachment-n2149567", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "By Marcela Ayres    BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President", "title": "Reuters News - Brazil's Rousseff scrambles for votes to avert impeachment", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/politics-elections/2016/04/16/brazils-rousseff-scrambles-for-votes-to-avert-impeachment-n2149567", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/_townhall/resources/images/thog.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Brazil's Rousseff scrambles for votes to avert impeachment, Reuters News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "In a rowdy session of speeches that went through the night, opposition congressmen shouted: \"Out with the Workers' Party!\"\nIf her impeachment is approved by the lower house, the Senate must then vote on whether to go ahead with putting Rousseff on trial for disobeying budget laws.\nRousseff's supporters, meanwhile, called for the ouster of House Speaker Eduardo Cunha, her political archenemy who has sped up the impeachment process.\nRousseff canceled an appearance at an anti-impeachment rally of union and leftist social activists led by former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, her predecessor and the Workers' Party leader.\nInstead she met with lawmakers behind closed doors in a bid to obtain their vote or abstention on Sunday when the lower house of Congress votes on whether she should be impeached for breaking the country's budget laws."}
