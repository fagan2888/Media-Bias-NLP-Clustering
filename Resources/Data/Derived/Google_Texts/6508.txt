*Following a national uproar after the Trayvon Martin case, Fox News did some enterprise journalism to seek out white people who’d been killed by black people.

*Despite massive evidence to the contrary, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly has repeatedly disavowed the idea of white privilege in the United States.

*Anchor Megyn Kelly insisted that Santa Claus and Jesus were white, though she said later that she was joking.

*In the immediate aftermath of the Charleston, S.C., church massacre, in which the alleged killer is said to have proclaimed that he had come to “shoot black people,” Fox News focused on the possibility of a hate crime against Christians.

Though not a monolith, Fox News has amassed an archive of lamentable moments on race relations — some of the much-commented-upon clips come off as race-baiting, others as racially insensitive and yet others just racially unhelpful.

Yet, South Carolina House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford didn’t accuse Fox News of just being racially insensitive. In a discussion on Thursday with CNN’s Jake Tapper regarding Charleston, Rutherford suggested that Fox News — or at least its ilk — all but handed instructions to alleged killer Dylann Roof:

South Carolina is one of five states that does not have a hate crimes law. South Carolina is the only state that I’m aware of that still flies a Confederate flag in front of the statehouse dome. South Carolina represents and is emblematic of the problem, which is words come from these networks that broadcast what they call news, but it’s not. It’s really hate speech and coded language and leads people to believe they can walk into a church, because it’s no longer a house of god, it’s a killing ground. It’s a place that they can feel free to desecrate and leave blood everywhere, and that’s what this man did. And he did so on some ill-gotten belief, on some wrong belief that it’s okay to do that. He hears that, because he watches the news and he watches things like Fox News, where they talk about things that they call news, but they’re really not. They use that coded language, they use hate speech, they talk about the president as if he’s not the president. They talk about churchgoers as if they’re not really churchgoers. And that’s what this young man acted on. That’s why you can walk into a church and treat people like animals when they’re really human beings.

The Internet took note of Rutherford’s remarks, which started off well. Surely South Carolina needs to consider the symbolism that flanks its official buildings, and indeed it is. Taking a close look at how coded language in the news media affects the way that people react to their surroundings is a worthwhile pursuit, too.

Yet Rutherford went quite a distance beyond those parameters, wading into dicey cause-and-effect territory and naming a specific — and highly controversial — media outlet in the process. Fox News is never shy about repelling such attacks, which is why O’Reilly himself cross-examined the lawmaker on Thursday night’s edition of “The O’Reilly Factor.” The host asked the South Carolina politician, “Now, you say that this Roof kid watches Fox News.” Rutherford went to the record: “I didn’t say that he watched Fox News,” said Rutherford. “I said…things like Fox News.” By the Erik Wemple Blog’s transcription of Rutherford’s CNN remarks, he most certainly did say that Roof watches “things like Fox News.” But what are “things like Fox News”? Are they actually Fox News? Fox Business News? FoxNews.com? Nation.FoxNews.com?

Politicians of various ideologies these days are verily trained to seed their rhetoric with attacks on the media. The result is often sloppy and bombastic media criticism, much of which is based on thin familiarity with the actual output of the media. Whether it’s from Fox News or other “networks,” this blog hasn’t come across any recent coverage indicating that it’s “okay” to shoot up a church. If Rutherford is saying that any amount of racially coded news coverage is tantamount to an incitement to racial violence, he should step forward and attempt to make that case. Until such a time, this outburst stands as a cheap-shot against Fox News.
