BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — The Office of the Attorney General wants to know if three local health insurance companies are violating the Affordable Care Act. Most women with private health insurance can get birth control for free. But some companies are still charging their members.

Many women don’t know, you are not supposed to pay any out-of-pocket costs for birth control. The Attorneys General is sending letters to three companies in our area to find out if they are violating these rules.

Health plans are required to provide a full range of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration. This should come at no charge to their members. But New York’s Attorney General is sending letters to HealthNow New York in Buffalo, Independent Health in Amherst, Univera Healthcare in Amherst and seven other insurers.

We reached out to the three local companies: Julie Snyder from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Western New York says, “Bluecross Blueshield of Western New York is in receipt of yesterday’s correspondence from the New York State Attorney General and as always, we will respond to this inquiry in a timely manner as requested. However, until we have adequately reviewed this inquiry, we cannot comment on the specifics of the inquiry.”

Peter Kates from Univera tells us, “We have received the letter. We follow the laws- we will comply with the questionnaire in a timely fashion requested by the attorney general.”

Frank Sava from Independent Health says, “We did receive the notification from the State Attorney General’s Office and we will certainly cooperate with the request for information. We believe we are in full accordance with the women’s preventive services benefit in the Affordable Care Act.”

The letters ask for responses from the companies about their practices. The responses are due by the end of May.
