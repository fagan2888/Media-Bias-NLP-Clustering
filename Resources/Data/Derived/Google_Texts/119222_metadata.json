The \"one more thing\u2026\" The WebMD. All doctors run into few types of patients who drive us crazy.\n\nI love being a family doctor, I really do. I love the patients, and the stories, and the excuses and the smiles.\n\nBut, I\u2019ve got to tell you, as much as I love helping people through their medical issues and, occasionally, making them feel better, all doctors run into few types of patients who drive us bananas.\n\nAnd, as the Affordable Care Act (which you may know as Obamacare) has opened up health-care to a much larger pool of Americans who will soon be scheduling appointments and showing up to a doctor\u2019s office with various aches and pains, let me offer a few tips to make that visit as pleasant as possible.\n\nPlease keep in mind that I say these with affection, but I do hope you are taking notes. (I hope my patients are reading this as well).\n\n1. The \u201cThat Little Green Pill\u201d Patient\n\nIf you don\u2019t know your medications, we might be in big trouble.\n\nI often ask patients what meds they\u2019re taking. Many will give me a blank stare and then start to describe their pills. \u201cThe little blue pill\u201d, \u201cthe square white one,\u201d \u201cthe yellow capsule,\u201d they\u2019ll say. I went to medical school and residency, but I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know shapes and colors of your pills.\n\nIt\u2019s important that you know your medications by name\u2014preferable by generic and brand name\u2014because not knowing your medications can lead to you taking the wrong medications, duplicate medications, and, in rare cases, this could be deadly..\n\nAs your family physician, it is important that I know you are actually taking the medications that I think you are taking. So, next time, before you come in, make a list of your meds and keep this list in your wallet or purse (this is also helpful if you have to go to the hospital for any reason). If a list isn\u2019t your style, at least throw all of your pill bottles in a bag and bring them to your office visit. We\u2019ll sort it out there.\n\n2. The \u201cYou\u2019re Late Again!\u201d Patient\n\nSometimes I run behind. I hate that this happens, but it does. Many of us docs do at some point during the day. Is it annoying for patients? Yes. Is your time valuable? Yes. Do we, your physicians, understand? Yes.\n\nBut the truth is there\u2019s often a good reason why we\u2019re late.\n\nSometimes when I am seeing a patient I have to take a moment to obtain lab results or radiology studies, or I might need to call a consulting physician on the phone during the visit. If those tests were yours, wouldn\u2019t you want me to take that extra time?\n\nAnd, from time to time, you\u2019ve been late too. Don\u2019t forget when patients are late it often puts us behind schedule, and that can magnify over the course of the day.\n\nI don\u2019t want it to sound like I\u2019m making excuses. I value your time. I really do. And if your doctor is always late, or rude, or indifferent, well\u2026 maybe it\u2019s time to move on. But, for those of us who aren\u2019t, please try to understand. We\u2019re doing the best we can.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

The \u201cCan I Have My Forms Now?\u201d Patient\n\nAh, the dreaded paperwork.\n\nAs a family physician, I often fill out paperwork for my patients to help with disability coverage, obtain handicap placards, or for insurance purposes, among many other reasons.\n\nPaperwork is very important. It is often directly related to your income or livelihood and I take it very seriously. But it takes time. Please remember that paperwork (especially when we get pages and pages and pages of it) requires time to complete. If you need paperwork completed, no problem, but please understand when I tell you that it may not be done within our 15-minute office visit.\n\n4. The \u201cOh, And One More Thing\u2026\u201d Patient\n\nIt happens to every doctor. I\u2019ve finished my office visit with the patient and am standing up, headed for the door. I smile and say, \u201cIt was great to see you, we\u2019ll see you back in three months,\u201d and I reach for the door-knob.\n\nAnd then it comes\u2026.\n\n\u201cYou know, doc,\u201d the patient says. \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing I wanted to talk to you about\u2026you see, I\u2019ve been having these chest pains\u2026.\u201d\n\nReally?!\n\nWe spent an entire visit together talking about this, that, and the other and you didn\u2019t mention a word about chest pain. Then you mention it as I am on my way out of the door?\n\nReally?!?!?!?\n\nSome medical conditions are easier to deal with than others at the last minute, but the real issue here is that in order to properly and thoroughly treat whatever is going on we need time. As physicians, we need to ask questions, do a physical exam and perform any necessary office testing (like an EKG).\n\nWe also need to determine a plan of action with you and provide counseling. When you bring up a health issue at the last minute it\u2019s simply not fair to you.\n\nIf you have a medical problem that you would like to bring up, please do so early in the visit.\n\nIf you tend to forget, write your health concerns down on a piece of paper and bring it with you. On the other hand, if you\u2019re embarrassed or reluctant to discuss your medical issues for whatever reason, please give this some thought before you get to your appointment. Our job is to help. Please don\u2019t wait until the last minute to bring up important matters.\n\nOh, and this is one of the situations that causes us docs to run behind (see #2).\n\n5. The \u201cThrow Grandma From the Car\u201d Person\n\nDo you care for a relative who has a hard time getting to the doc by themselves? Do you bring them to the doctor and go into the exam room with them for their appointment?\n\nIf you answered yes to both questions you can skip to #6. If you answered \u201cyes\u201d to the first question but \u201cno\u201d to the second, then guess what?\n\nWe need to talk.\n\nIf you \u201cdrop off\u201d grandma at the office, and then take off to run your other errands, that may not be best for grandma\u2014or the doctor. Think about it this way. If, say, your loved one has memory problems and doesn\u2019t remember your name on most days, they probably won\u2019t remember mine, either. If she isn\u2019t able to articulate her symptoms, her medications (see #1) and other details, this could make or break her diagnosis. Please come into the office appointment with your loved one and help them with the important details. Or just hold her hand. The doctor\u2019s office can be a scary place.\n\n6. The \u201cThe Internet Says So\u201d Patient\n\nI love it when my patients take an active interest in their health. I want patients to understand their medical condition, medications and treatment options.\n\nBut, don\u2019t believe everything you read. The Internet is filled with lots of amazing information. Unfortunately, not all of it is true or applicable to your particular situation.\n\nI am not asking you to stop searching for health information online. I am just asking you to let me help. Talk to me about the websites you are getting your information from. I can tell you if they are any good or suggest better places to look for reliable information.\n\n7. The Secretive Patient\n\nIf you stopped taking your blood pressure meds because they were too expensive, they made you nauseous or you just don\u2019t want to \u201ctake another pill,\u201d don\u2019t hide it. Tell me. If you\u2019ve been having that weird pain or feel a new lump, tell me. If you really didn\u2019t schedule your colonoscopy like we discussed (and you agreed to) because you are actually afraid, tell me. If you are struggling with something (ANYTHING)\u2014 you lost your job, a loved one died, or you just can\u2019t shake the depression you\u2019ve been feeling, TELL ME!\n\nAs your physician, I want to help you live the healthiest life possible. I understand that life is not always easy, and talking about those difficulties can be hard. I also know that your worries, fears, joys, and pains may affect your overall health. But, I only know what you tell me. It\u2019s important that we have open and honest communication. So tell me what\u2019s on your mind.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "drjencaudle"}, "keywords": "Medicine, Health, Technology", "publicationDate": 201402061045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/tech-and-health", "description": "The chronically late.
