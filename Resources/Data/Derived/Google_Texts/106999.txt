Exploration and production company American Eagle Energy Corp. has reached a deal with half of its bondholders, after skipping a March interest payment, that gives the company and its debt holders more time to work out the terms of a restructuring agreement.

More than half of the holders of American Eagle’s $175 million of bonds agreed to forbear — that is, not to take action to collect their debt — until May 15 in exchange for a partial interest payment, according to financial disclosures filed Wednesday.

Denver-based American Eagle on April 2 paid $4 million of the $9.8 million interest payment due March 2, according to regulatory filings, as part of the agreement. The company had skipped that payment altogether last month, instead entering a 30-day grace period on the bonds. It’s in default on the remaining $5.8 million but is protected by the forbearance agreement through the beginning of May.

American Eagle’s chief financial officer declined to provide additional details Wednesday.

The company also reported initial earnings for the three months ending in December 2014. American Eagle reported adjusted EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, of $7.9 million and net losses of $78.6 million. That’s compared with $7.6 million in EBITDA and $462,000 of losses for the same quarter in 2013.
