FLOTUS steps into ACA spotlight\n\nPresident Barack Obama has struggled to sell his health care law this fall \u2014 and until now, he\u2019s largely been without his top seller: first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nThe first lady has done little to promote the Affordable Care Act in recent months, marking a shift from her usual role as the president\u2019s middle class messenger \u2014 a move that allowed her to sidestep the political battles over the law, and questions about the administration\u2019s trustworthiness.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nNow, with HealthCare.gov\u2019s glitches mostly fixed, and pressure mounting for the administration to boost enrollment numbers \u2014 and the president\u2019s approval ratings continuing to slump \u2014 she took on a new level of public involvement Wednesday, co-hosting a group of mothers in the Oval Office, and sitting solo for a round of interviews with African-American radio hosts.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Microsoft exec to be picked for HealthCare.gov)\n\n\u201cThe first lady is the best salesperson\u201d for the White House, senior adviser Valerie Jarrett told POLITICO. She\u2019s getting involved now, Jarrett said, because she\u2019s the right person to convey the message of the moment: that the uninsured \u2014 especially young people and minorities \u2014 should look for insurance on exchanges and that those with insurance are already feeling the benefits of the law.\n\nAs this phase continues, Obama will speak out more on health care, Jarrett said. People familiar with the White House\u2019s plans expect more engagement by the first lady in 2014.\n\nThe timing of her involvement, after controversies have eased and ahead of the holidays, is no accident.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that they wanted to keep her away from the mess it,\u201d said Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist who has a good relationship with the East Wing. \u201cNow that things have started to smooth out and they\u2019ve been able to get to a point of focusing more on the benefits and those folks who are able to sign up for insurance, it\u2019s the right moment for the first lady to get involved.\u201d\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Next Obamacare crisis: Small biz costs?)\n\nObama steered clear of discussing the health care law through the difficult months of October and November \u2014 though after the government shutdown ended, she did attack House Republicans for \u201cshut[ting] down our government to try to shut down Obamacare.\u201d\n\nAn acknowledgement of the problems with HealthCare.gov was conspicuously absent from that same speech, on Oct. 25, as she offered a reminder to Democratic women of the importance of keeping in mind the people who are benefiting from the law, the \u201cfolks who come from all across the country, who come from all different backgrounds and walks of life.\u201d\n\nThe first lady and president conveyed a similar, positive message on Wednesday afternoon, as they hosted an Oval Office meeting for eight mothers who have helped their families and their communities tackle health care challenges.\n\n( WATCH: Obamacare timeline)\n\n\u201cWhat the Affordable Care Act provides and can provide for so many families out there is peace of mind,\u201d the first lady said when reporters were allowed in at the end of the meeting. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about politics; it\u2019s about making sure that every family has the peace of mind to know that if a child gets sick, or someone loses a job, or someone has an illness that requires hundreds of thousands of dollars in coverage, that they\u2019re going to have the safety net that they need to make sure that they don\u2019t lose their home, that they aren\u2019t spending the rest of their lives paying off medical fees.\u201d\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "With pressure mounting to boost ACA enrollment, she takes a new level of public involvement.", "title": "FLOTUS steps into ACA spotlight", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/michelle-obama-obamacare-101305.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/12/18/131218_michelle_barack_obama_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Health Care (1880),Michelle Obama (654),Obamacare (1195)", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "With pressure mounting to boost ACA enrollment, she takes a new level of public involvement.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "FLOTUS steps into ACA spotlightPresident Barack Obama has struggled to sell his health care law this fall \u2014 and until now, he\u2019s largely been without his top seller: first lady Michelle Obama.\nAs this phase continues, Obama will speak out more on health care, Jarrett said.\n( Also on POLITICO: Microsoft exec to be picked for HealthCare.gov)\u201cThe first lady is the best salesperson\u201d for the White House, senior adviser Valerie Jarrett told POLITICO.\nThe White House plans to have more engagement from Michelle Obama in 2014.\nPeople familiar with the White House\u2019s plans expect more engagement by the first lady in 2014."}
