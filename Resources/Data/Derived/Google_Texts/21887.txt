We take many things for granted on a daily basis, like walking, speaking, and even using our hands to type on the computer or jot things down. Imagine, then, what life is like for people suffering from Parkinson’s disease, who witness their motor skills and ability to hold a fork gradually deteriorate.

Now, scientists are offering Parkinson’s patients hope with a new pen called the ARC Pen, which was designed to prevent the shakiness that occurs when patients write or draw. People with Parkinson’s experience hand cramping when attempting to write, which makes their letters extremely small and difficult to read; it's a condition known as micrographia. While writing seems like a simple thing to most of us, being unable to do this task can become bothersome and frustrating to Parkinson's patients.

“We heard stories of how frustrating it was for people who were still working, or who wanted to write a card, sign documents, anything that had to do with writing,” Lucy Jung, the product designer of the ARC Pen, told Wired UK.

Designed by the company DOPA Solution, the ARC Pen uses high-frequency vibrations to massage the hand and prevent cramping. It also makes it much easier for the pen to roll across the paper. In a trial testing it on 14 people with Parkinson’s, scientists found that the ARC Pen boosted writing 86 percent of the time.

DOPA Solution notes on its website that the ARC Pen is the first “specifically designed for people with Parkinson’s living with Micrographia," adding that "many people with this motor control difficulty give up the practice of writing or drawing altogether. Dopa Solution’s aim is to focus on higher level needs in order to have the greatest impact on people’s lives."
