EDINA, Minn. (AP) - A Metro Transit bus driver is recovering at home after suffering potentially “life-altering” head injuries when several teenagers assaulted him at a stop in a Minneapolis suburb last week, authorities said.

The attack happened over noontime Thursday at the Southdale stop in Edina, the Star Tribune (http://strib.mn/1MMe8bD ) reported. The bus route connects the Mall of America in Bloomington with the Southdale shopping center in Edina.

The 22-year veteran driver suffered “very serious” injuries, Metro Transit spokesman Howie Padilla said Saturday night.

“I think they had the potential to be life-altering,” Padilla said.

John Zapata, an officer with Local 1005 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, said the driver, whose name has not been released, “did nothing wrong to provoke this physical attack.”

The driver has left Fairview Southdale Hospital in Edina and is home recuperating, Zapata said.

According to the Edina police report, the driver was assaulted by five to seven males. The report says the driver had a bleeding wound to his head, and had no recollection of the assault.

Zapata said video surveillance from inside the bus “was downloaded, and now police have it.” Several suspects were questioned, and one juvenile was arrested, Padilla said.
