In many areas around the state there is snow and plenty of it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since we\u2019ve been able to grab any part of December,\u201d Kathy Mazzuchelli, director of Caribou Parks and Recreation and voice of snowmobiling in northern Maine. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough couple of years but now the \u2018ka-ching\u2019 meters are turning in [Aroostook] County.\u201d\n\nA series of storms in December dumped up to several feet of snow around the state and from Kittery to Fort Kent, clubs and volunteers are out grooming trails for what is shaping up to be a banner year for Maine\u2019s $350 million snowmobile industry.\n\n\u201cThings are looking fantastic,\u201d according to Bob Meyers, executive director of the Maine Snowmobile Association. \u201cThere is a high level of enthusiasm and absolutely terrific conditions with everything we look for.\u201d\n\nCold temperatures combined with regular and plentiful snow are creating perfect conditions, Meyers said.\n\n\u201cIf this keeps up, this year will be one to remember,\u201d he said.\n\nThe only exception, according to Meyers, is a swath of Maine running from the New Hampshire border to Down East areas that was hit by the pre-Christmas ice storm.\n\n\u201cIn some areas there was significant damage to the trails and the clubs are scrambling,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are downed trees, branches hanging down and other damage.\u201d\n\nIn those areas affected by the storm, Meyers said he is asking anyone who rides to contact local clubs and volunteer some time to help out.\n\n\u201cIf you are going out for a ride, bring along a handsaw,\u201d he said. \u201cIt only takes a minute to remove downed branches and it\u2019s a real help.\u201d\n\nProgress in opening those storm-damaged areas varies, Meyers said.\n\n\u201cIn some places they are almost back to 100 percent where others they are still scratching their heads,\u201d he said.\n\nBut in areas that are being groomed?\n\n\u201cIt does not get any better than what we have now,\u201d he said. \u201cThe clubs are out there doing a terrific job and that snow keeps on coming.\u201d\n\nAll of this comes as a welcome relief to businesses that rely heavily on the snowmobile traffic.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago it was a disaster,\u201d Meyers said. \u201cLast year was a nice recovery year and this year as of right now they are riding as much in York as they are in the St. John Valley [and] you can go on a nice trip right out of your dooryard and that\u2019s when things really get hopping.\u201d\n\nAt the New England Outdoor Center in Millinocket, owner Matthew Polstein is optimistic about his season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal out there and we couldn\u2019t be happier,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve not had snow like this this early in years.\u201d\n\nTrails in the Katahdin area are groomed and ready, Polstein said, adding some areas in the Jo-Mary area are closed or being rerouted due to logging.\n\n\u201cBut by next week everything should be fully operational,\u201d he said. \u201cThings are in really great shape [and] we are off to a great start.\u201d\n\nFeelings are running just as high at Mt. Chase Lodge, where owners Sara and Rick Hill predict all trails in their area will be fully groomed by the weekend.\n\n\u201cWe have already been getting calls from people who are anxious to come,\u201d Sara HIll said. \u201cLast year we did not start until the end of January so this is a nice early start.\u201d\n\nWith conditions favorable over much of Maine, Sara Hill said people can travel north entirely on snowmobile.\n\n\u201cPeople can come up by sled,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is wonderful.\u201d\n\nLogging operations and some as-yet unfrozen sections of lakes are creating some \u201chiccups in the system,\u201d according to Mazzuchelli, but overall it\u2019s looking good.\n\n\u201cThe snow is not perfect, but there is a lot of it,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the business community this is some good snow and there is plenty of trail to ride.\u201d\n\nMazzuchelli and Meyers both urge riders to check with local club members before venturing out on lakes.\n\n\u201cI would advise using a great deal of caution for another week or two to let [the lakes] set up,\u201d Mazzuchelli said. \u201cWait for the locals to establish the trails, that way you know that section is safe.\u201d\n\nIn Portage, in response to last year\u2019s accident in which a groomer went through the ice into Portage Lake, the club has rerouted that trail so it is completely off the lake, Mazzuchelli said.\n\nThe interest in Maine snowmobiling is already high, according to Meyers.\n\n\u201cThere is mind-boggling interest from out of state,\u201d he said. \u201cOn Dec. 27 we put the trail conditions report on our Facebook page and in 24 hours we had more than 8,400 people view and act on it \u2014 that is really good news.\u201d\n\nWhile he has no official numbers on how many are coming to Maine to ride, Meyers said things are looking busy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the snow,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople complain about the price of gas driving to work, but you don\u2019t hear any complaints when the conditions to ride are good.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "FORT KENT, Maine \u2014 This is the winter for which avid snowmobilers have been waiting.
