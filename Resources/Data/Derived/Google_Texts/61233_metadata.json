The late writer/director Nora Ephron was a longtime resident of the The Apthrop, and the building was featured in the 1986 film adaptation of her novel \u201cHeartburn.\u201d\n\nBy Kirthana Ramisetti\n\nOn a Sunday afternoon in early September, a casually dressed group of women assembled in front of an organic dry cleaner on New York\u2019s Upper West Side.\n\nDespite its ordinary appearance, the shop on Columbus Avenue and 69th Street is a mecca for romantic comedy lovers, entertainment journalists Jennifer Armstrong and Erin Carlson told the women.The exterior served as the site of the Shop Around the Corner, which fans of the 1998 Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks movie \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d might remember as the children\u2019s bookstore owned by Ms. Ryan\u2019s character, Kathleen Kelly.\n\nThis was the starting point for Ms. Armstrong and Ms. Carlson\u2019s walking tour of romantic comedy film sites.\n\nFrom the 1960 classic \u201cThe Apartment\u201d to more recent fare such as 2007\u2019s \u201cMusic & Lyrics,\u201d the Upper West Side has often served as the backdrop for so-called rom-coms.\n\nThe leafy, tree-lined neighborhood turns out to be an ideal setting to depict characters falling in love.\n\n\u201cThe Upper West Side is so beautiful, sparkly, clean, and spacious compared with a lot of other New York neighborhoods,\u201d said Ms. Armstrong, author of \u201cMary and Lou and Rhoda and Ted,\u201d a backstage history of the \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show.\u201d \u201cIt looks and feels like a movie set.\u201d\n\nThe Everett Collection Meg Ryan gives a speech outside of her character\u2019s fictional store in \u201cYou\u2019ve got Mail.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail\u201d and \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally,\u201d movies written by the late Nora Ephron, have indelibly linked the Upper West Side with the crowd-pleasing genre. In fact, the idea for the tour came when the two friends were planning a movie night and began acting out scenes from \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail.\u201d\n\nAgaton Strom for The Wall Street Journal And here is what the store looks like today: La Mode Organic Cleaners on West 69th. The site is a main spot on the tour.\n\nSidetour, a website that allows users to host and book tours in various cities, had approached Ms. Armstrong about giving a walking tour based on her \u201cThe Mary Tyler Moore Show\u201d book, but that conversation with Ms. Carlson made her realize romantic comedies were a better fit.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, we saw a way that all of this knowledge we have of the movie genre that shaped our lives would finally do some good,\u201d said Ms. Armstrong.\n\nBefore the first tour, Ms. Carlson expressed hope that attendees would view it as an opportunity to \u201cfully embrace their love for the genre,\u201d which is sometimes scoffed at by critics for being frivolous and passed over by studios in favor of action movies.\n\n\u201cWanting to hang out in Nora Ephron\u2019s New York is equally valid to, say, living vicariously through macho anti-heroes like Tony Soprano and Walter White,\u201d said Ms. Carlson of the protagonists from \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d\n\nFive women \u2014 all New Yorkers, ranging in age from late 20s to late 50s \u2014 signed up for the inaugural walking tour, which the organizers plan to offer again twice in October. The tour stopped at seven filming locations between 69th Street and 83rd Street, and at each stop, Ms. Armstrong and Ms. Carlson shared the story of the site\u2019s connection to the silver screen. There\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Luxembourg, the setting of a famous double date scene in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally,\u201d and a Starbucks on 81st and Broadway that was frequented by the lead characters in \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail.\u201d\n\nAs the group traveled uptown, the walking tour evolved into a discussion among like-minded fans. The guides and tour-goers exchanged opinions on an assortment of topics, from who is the modern-day Ms. Ryan (Rachel McAdams, star of \u201cThe Notebook,\u201d was suggested) to the delightfully odd casting of comedian Dave Chappelle as Tom Hanks\u2019 sidekick in \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail.\u201d The tour concluded at the bar Prohibition with a screening of \u201cYou\u2019ve Got Mail,\u201d with Ms. Carlson and Ms. Armstrong trading quips and offering commentary.\n\nCat Pappas, an Upper East Side resident who works in television production, said that the tour offered interesting tidbits on some of her favorite films but also provided a look at New York\u2019s transformation. For every Caf\u00e9 Luxembourg still going strong, there were plenty of other neighborhood mainstays, such as H&H Bagels, that had disappeared.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was a lot about how the city is changing,\u201d said Ms. Pappas. \u201cThese places are iconic in your mind from films, and they aren\u2019t even here anymore.\u201d\n\nGina O\u2019Connor, 27, a graduate student at Columbia University who moved to the city a few weeks ago from Michigan, said that her love of romantic comedies has made the transition easier for her.\n\n\u201cThey kind of made me really feel familiar with New York, having never been,\u201d said Ms. O\u2019Connor. She added that visiting filming locations such as Central Park \u201chelped alleviate the stress and overwhelmingness of it all.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s that kind of comfort that romantic comedies provide, the tour guides said. While they say that the genre has experienced a decline, the good news for rom-com fans is that the romantic comedy is now thriving on the small screen in such television shows as \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d \u201cThe New Girl\u201d and \u201cThe Mindy Project.\u201d\n\nEven so, at various times during the tour, the attendees and tour guides expressed how much they missed a good movie romance.\n\n\u201cLife is hard enough,\u201d said Ms. Carlson. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to bask in the satisfaction of cinematic soulmates finding each other.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "On a Sunday afternoon in early September, a casually dressed group of women assembled in front of a nondescript organic dry cleaner on the Upper West Side.", "title": "On Upper West Side, a Walking Tour for Romantic Comedy Lovers", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/16/on-upper-west-side-a-walking-tour-for-romantic-comedy-lovers/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YW789_0912ny_G_20130912141900.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "On Upper West Side, a Walking Tour for Romantic Comedy Lovers", "description": "On a Sunday afternoon in early September, a casually dressed group of women assembled in front of a nondescript organic dry cleaner on the Upper West Side.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Carrie Melago", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "On a Sunday afternoon in early September, a casually dressed group of women assembled in front of a nondescript organic dry cleaner on the Upper West Side.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-16T21:01:39-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-161", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/16/on-upper-west-side-a-walking-tour-for-romantic-comedy-lovers/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-18467", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "On a Sunday afternoon in early September, a casually dressed group of women assembled in front of a nondescript organic dry cleaner on the Upper West Side.", "title": "On Upper West Side, a Walking Tour for Romantic Comedy Lovers", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/16/on-upper-west-side-a-walking-tour-for-romantic-comedy-lovers/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YW789_0912ny_G_20130912141900.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-18467", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-17T18:04:33-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce5f1\"", "article_summary": "This was the starting point for Ms. Armstrong and Ms. Carlson\u2019s walking tour of romantic comedy film sites.\nFrom the 1960 classic \u201cThe Apartment\u201d to more recent fare such as 2007\u2019s \u201cMusic & Lyrics,\u201d the Upper West Side has often served as the backdrop for so-called rom-coms.\nA walking tour on the Upper West Side focused on movie locations from romantic comedies led by entertainment writers Jennifer Armstrong, in rose dress above, and Erin Carlson stopped by The Apthorp apartment building at 2211 Broadway.\n\u201cLife is hard enough,\u201d said Ms. Carlson.\nThe tour stopped at seven filming locations between 69th Street and 83rd Street, and at each stop, Ms. Armstrong and Ms. Carlson shared the story of the site\u2019s connection to the silver screen."}
