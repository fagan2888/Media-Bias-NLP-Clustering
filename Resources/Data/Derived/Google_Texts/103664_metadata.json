They noted that men have long had an easier time getting birth control, simply purchasing condoms over the counter.\n\n\u201cWe support efforts like these that remove barriers to women gaining access to birth control and other reproductive health care,\u201d said Kathy Kneer, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, in a written statement.\n\nShe added that hormonal contraception has been widely studied and shown to be safe \u2014 \u201cso safe that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has recommended that it be available over the counter.\u201d\n\nThe contraceptives won\u2019t be available like cough drops or antacids, however. In California, pharmacists can only dispense them after providing a health screening to women and taking their blood pressure. Oregon will also require a health screening, but the state\u2019s specific rules haven\u2019t been developed.\n\nThe laws differ somewhat. California\u2019s law has no age restrictions on patients \u2014 minors have the same access as adults. In Oregon, pharmacists may only give new birth control prescriptions to women 18 or older. Women under 18 must show proof of prior birth control prescriptions from a physician. Also, Oregon likely will require pharmacists to undergo more training than the one hour of education required of California pharmacists, said Marcus Watt, executive director of the Oregon State Board of Pharmacy.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s rules are expected to take effect after Oct. 1 and Oregon\u2019s law after Jan. 1.\n\nElizabeth Nash, senior state issues associate at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health think tank, said other states could end up following California\u2019s and Oregon\u2019s approaches, depending on how they work.\n\n\u201cA lot of eyes are watching what\u2019s going to happen next,\u201d she said.\n\nThe laws moved ahead despite partisan debate in Congress over access to birth control. There, members of both parties support legislation allowing over-the-counter access \u2014 without any prescription \u2014 but Republican legislation would not require insurers to pay for it.\n\nDemocrats say that is an attempt to get around requirements to cover prescription birth control under the Affordable Care Act and would effectively make hormonal contraceptives off limits to many poor women. They have introduced a bill that would require insurance coverage of over-the-counter hormonal contraceptives.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s regulations and Oregon\u2019s law do not address insurance coverage of birth control. But California\u2019s pharmacists have voiced concerns that insurers won\u2019t pay for time spent screening women and dispensing birth control, as they would for a doctor\u2019s visit.\n\nPharmacists in California say they are preparing for the new regulations and hoping to resolve the reimbursement issue. It has taken nearly two years to develop regulations implementing California\u2019s 2013 law, which also allows pharmacists to prescribe other medications that once required a doctor\u2019s prescription, including travel medicines, smoking cessation treatments and the opioid overdose antidote naloxone.\n\nThe overall expansion of pharmacists\u2019 prescribing authority is aimed at relieving the burden on physicians faced with an influx of patients newly insured under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cHonestly, we\u2019re really excited,\u201d said Ken Thai, part-owner and manager of the El Monte Pharmacy Group, with 10 stores in Southern California. \u201cMedical clinics in the area are overflowing, with long wait times. We\u2019re already doing other services like immunizations and cholesterol checks, and our customers already see us as a resource. We\u2019re ready for something like this. It\u2019s been a long time coming.\u201d\n\nUntil now, California pharmacists could only provide emergency contraception, also known as \u201cmorning-after pill,\u201d without a doctor\u2019s prescription.\n\nKaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
