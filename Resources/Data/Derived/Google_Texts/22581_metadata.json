It\u2019s unclear exactly what\u2019s causing the migration, but industry observers tell The AIS Report that there are several possible explanations.\n\nThe decline of about 6% could be due in part to increased adoption of a self-insured strategy among employers. Another explanation could be that some employers have dropped health benefits and urged workers to find coverage through a public insurance exchange, equities analyst Carl McDonald wrote in a Jan. 5 note to investors. McDonald left Citigroup Global Markets Inc. on Jan. 21. The Blues have at least a 50% share of the commercial risk market in 30 states, he noted, and have had relatively stable enrollment since 2011.\n\n\u201cThis suggests either that self-funded conversions are accelerating in 2014, or that small-group dumping has been more pronounced at the Blues than has been the case at most publicly traded plans,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCase in point: In an Oct. 29 conference call to discuss third-quarter earnings, Anthem, Inc.\u2019s CEO noted that its small-business customers were dropping their group health plans and moving workers to the public exchanges at a faster clip than expected. Already in 2014, Anthem had watched 218,000 members of its health plans disappear because their employers have ended their group health plans. That\u2019s a 12% drop in the insurer\u2019s overall small-group membership.\n\nWhile some employers might be encouraging workers to find coverage through a public insurance exchange, private exchanges might be having a more significant effect. Multi-carrier private exchanges often are able to offer more competitively priced products in exchange for narrow provider networks, says Ash Shehata, U.S. advisory lead for health plans at KPMG LLP. \u201cIronically, many of the Blues participate in private exchanges\u2026so they might still be benefitting from the membership, but it just might not be showing up on the traditional small-group product line,\u201d he notes. Most Blues plans also either have or are building their own proprietary private exchange that they think will bring more stability to their pricing.\n\nStop-Loss Rates Are Attractive\n\nRising coverage costs, combined with attractive rates from stop-loss carriers, are prompting more companies to turn to administrative services only (ASO) contracts to reduce employee benefits costs. And self-insuring is becoming more common among much smaller firms, says Shehata. \u201cIn the past, you had to have a $1 billion-plus kind of company to do an ASO. But now you are seeing $300 million to $500 million as the number,\u201d he says. \u201cThis whole notion of self-funded [insurance] having many more options is definitely the name of the game this year.\u201d\n\nDeep Banerjee, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor\u2019s, says he\u2019s noticed smaller employers moving toward a self-insured strategy. And while ASO business poses less risk for the carriers, it also is less profitable. \u201cASO plans are fee based, so there is a smaller portion of total revenue compared to risk-based plans, and that does impact the top line to an extent,\u201d he says. In an effort to retain employer clients, more Blues plans are touting ASO options. But large for-profit carriers tend to have better scale, which lets them offer more competitive rates than Blues plans. \u201cASO is really a scale play. You get a fixed fee out of it, but if you don\u2019t have scale, it is hard to make it a profitable part of your membership,\u201d he adds.\n\nWade Olson, national practice leader for employee benefits at BB&T, agrees that employers are migrating to self-insurance, lured by competitive pricing from stop-loss carriers, along with better data about the health risk of their own employees. The trend, he says, has been most apparent in the Southeast and the East Coast. BB&T has about 12,000 employee benefits customers, most of which are fully insured small groups.\n\nStop-Loss Carriers Get Competitive\n\nTravis Riker, senior benefits consultant at Arista Consulting Group in Alpharetta, Ga., has been noticing a similar trend. Stop-loss insurers \u2014 such as Excess Reinsurance and HCC Insurance Holdings, Inc. \u2014 have grown more competitive and are luring mid-sized, fully insured employers away from Blues plans, as well as from the large national carriers.\n\nTo counter that trend, some Blues plans are re-evaluating their pricing model for ASO services and are working to be more competitive. Olson says that Blues plans traditionally have not been competitive on stop-loss and administration fees. Instead, they\u2019ve relied on their strengths such as broad networks, steep network discounts and brand recognition to capture and retain their full-risk business. But that is changing as employers search for different strategies to hold down benefits costs.\n\nStop loss carriers are positioned to gain market share because they don\u2019t have to comply with some provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) such as essential health benefits and some of the fees that fully insured plans must pay, according to Olson.\n\n\u201cI believe the stop-loss market is utilizing [the Affordable Care Act] as an opportunity to build market share. It will likely take three to five years to see if their gamble pays off,\u201d he says.\n\nWhile self-funding has traditionally been an option limited to employers with 250 or more workers, smaller firms with healthy workforces and a couple years\u2019 worth of claims data want to take advantage of their low risk. \u201cThey\u2019re feeling like they might have more control over costs in the future because they have created a culture of health, experience low turnover and have educated their associates as consumers, not users, of their health insurance\u2026so they\u2019re willing to take that risk,\u201d Olson explains.\n\nCould that leave Blues plans with more risk in their fully insured populations? \u201cIn theory, yes,\u201d he says. \u201cAny time you start changing the risk of the pool, either taking out good risk or putting in bad risk, it\u2019s going to have a negative aspect regarding pricing.\u201d\n\nRisk membership among Blues plans peaked at 20.4 million lives at the end of 2007, according to McDonald. Since then, not-for-profit Blues plans have lost about 4.8 million enrollees \u2014 a 24% decline. He is dubious that Blues plans will see growth in the group risk segment and suggests future enrollment gains will come through the individual market.\n\n\u00a9 2015 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
