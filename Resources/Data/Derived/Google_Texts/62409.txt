Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel on Friday named Forrest Claypool as his next Chief of Staff.

Claypool, who currently serves as President of the Chicago Transit Authority, will replace Lisa Schrader, who will leave the Emanuel administration after serving in the role for two years.

"I've known Forrest Claypool for 35 years. He has an unparalleled record of reform, accountability, and leadership in city and county government," Emanuel said in a statement. "That's why one of the first calls I made during my transition in 2011 was to Forrest to ask him to lead the CTA. He is a world-class manager, and under him, the CTA has never been run better."

Emanuel cited the Red Line South Reconstruction Project as an example of Claypool’s “management and vision.”

Claypool also served a superintendent of the Chicago Park District in the 1990s.

He is expected to begin his new role after the inauguration. His replacement at the CTA has not yet been named, but officials expect an announcement will be made in the coming weeks.
