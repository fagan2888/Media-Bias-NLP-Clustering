Police have arrested a suspect and found a red Jeep they say is linked to a Denver hit-and-run crash that seriously injured one person early Wednesday morning.

The crash involved two vehicles, and happened at Colorado Boulevard and East Iowa Avenue around 4:30 a.m., according to Denver police.

The driver of a green Ford Explorer was injured, but expected to survive, police told 7NEWS.

Northbound Colorado Boulevard was closed at East Iowa Avenue while police investigated.

Police found the damaged red Jeep Wednesday morning in a parking lot in the 4100 block of East Iowa Avenue.

The suspected hit-and-run driver was found in a residence nearby the Jeep and was taken into custody without further incident, said Sonny Jackson, a police spokesman.

The name of the suspect will be released after police positively identify him, Jackson said.

An investigation is ongoing.

Injuries the one driver suffered are not life-threatening, Jackson said.
