I really have never been fired. I was just moping around the house just like, \u2018Oh what did I do?\u2019\u201d Davis said.\n\nThe general Dynamics call center is handling questions from people trying to register of the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.\n\nHannity called the hotline number during his radio show.

No one is able to get in, but if they call us we can help them fill out an application as long as they went online to create an account first.\"\n\nShe answered all Hannity\u2019s questions and then hung up.\n\nThe next day she says General Dynamics Human Resource Officials called her into their office and fired her for taking the phone call.\n\nDavis said the company treated her like a criminal.\n\n\"They wouldn't even let me go to my locker and clean it out. One lady that was sitting next to me, she cleaned it out,\u201d Davis said.\n\nDavis admits her week of training wasn\u2019t enough.\n\n\"Some of the trainers didn't know what was going on. We had to go amongst ourselves to ask questions and you know help each other out,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen Davis gets the check, she says she\u2019ll use the money to buy health insurance for her children.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "A Panama City woman will be getting more than $25,000 from Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity.", "language": "english", "author": "Morgan Kyrklund", "og": {"description": "A Panama City woman will be getting more than $25,000 from Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity.", "title": "Local ObamaCare Hotline Worker Fired After Speaking to Sean Hannity", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Local-ObamaCare-Hotline-Worker-Fired-After-Speaking-to-Sean-Hannity-229452861.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/iupl/448/B99/448B9915CFED41DA99ADD4EDE174B225", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/158/65C/15865C48A0EF4C168722D62B77A656AF.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wjhg.com", "description": "A Panama City woman will be getting more than $25,000 from Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity.", "title": "Local ObamaCare Hotline Worker Fired After Speaking to Sean Hannity", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Local-ObamaCare-Hotline-Worker-Fired-After-Speaking-to-Sean-Hannity-229452861.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/196B2E3C777B4AA2ABDF9EBB9C967F62_8.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Local ObamaCare Hotline Worker Fired After Speaking to Sean Hannity", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Local ObamaCare Hotline Worker Fired, After Speaking to Sean Hannity"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89cc\"", "article_summary": "Hannity is paying the money to Earline Davis because he believes he\u2019s responsible for Davis getting fired.\nUntil this week, Davis was a customer service reprehensive at the new General Dynamics call center in Lynn Haven.\nThe general Dynamics call center is handling questions from people trying to register of the Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare.\nThe next day she says General Dynamics Human Resource Officials called her into their office and fired her for taking the phone call.\nA Panama City woman will be getting more than $25,000 from Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity."}
