I got to see the first laugh, I got to see the first crawl, you know? And when she needed me, I was there.\u201d\n\nCarricher said she was fortunate to have the financial ability to stay at home with her daughters, but it\u2019s not an option for every Ohio family.\n\nState representatives unveiled a proposal on Tuesday that would allow Ohio workers to take 12 weeks of paid family leave to care for a sick relative or after the birth or adoption of a child. Sponsored by Rep. Christie Kuhns (D-Cincinnati) and Rep. Janine Boyd (D-Cleveland Heights), the Family and Medical Leave Insurance program would begin in 2020 under the direction of the Department of Job and Family Services.\n\nThe bill proposes an employee-funded system, in which all workers would see small deductions in their paychecks, for a total of about $25 to $50 per year. Employers could choose to pay those amounts on behalf of employees.\n\nKuhns, who said she gave birth to her son one year ago, noted that many Ohio families cannot afford to take advantage of the federal Family and Medical Leave Act, which allows workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave.\n\n\u201cWe have many families throughout Ohio that have jobs that welcome a new child into their families, that have serious health conditions,\u201d Kuhns said. \u201cAs someone who recently went through that experience, and also as someone who suffers from two autoimmune disorders that I have to manage on a daily basis, I think this is something that we all need to rally behind.\u201d\n\nWorkers would be eligible under this proposed program if the leave is to care for a new child, a sick relative or their own health condition. Workers would file a claim after working at least 680 hours and having deductions withheld for at least one year. The proposed benefit, Kuhns said, would provide up to $1,000 per week, based on workers\u2019 average weekly wages in a tiered system, much like unemployment compensation.\n\nRep. Janine Boyd said the goal of the program was to give families \u201cthe time they need to heal, to recover, to bond and to care for each other.\u201d\n\nThe sponsors noted the bill would require an actuarial analysis that would likely cost approximately $400,000, paid for either by foundation grants or a fiscal allocation. The analysis would help determine how much workers would have deducted from their paycheck and whether it would be a set amount or on a sliding scale.\n\nCarricher said she thought the proposed bill was a good start.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d Carricher said. \u201cI would like to see it be a year like some of these other countries, because really, for the first year, your child is developing and they need you.\u201d\n\nBecause the program is employee-funded, it may not be as difficult to get small businesses involved, according to Michaela Hahn Burriss of Small Business Majority.\n\nOn the phone Wednesday, Hahn Burriss told NBC4 her organization has conducted national scientific opinion polls of small business owners about family leave. She said that when programs are employee-funded rather than employer-sponsored, the margin of support among small business owners increases.\n\nHahn Burriss also said that when employees take leave, the majority of small business owners said they do not see a decrease in productivity and that they adjust the workload among remaining employees, rather than hiring an additional person or contract out the work.\n\nDon DePerro, president and chief executive officer of the Columbus Chamber of Commerce, noted that while small businesses may not be able to bear the costs of an employee paid leave program on their own, they are not opposed to programs to keep workers happy.\n\n\u201cPeople want their time off, people want to take leave for their family, for personal reasons, for all types of reasons,\u201d DePerro said. \u201cSo flexibility in the workplace is something we\u2019re going to see more and more of as time goes on.\u201d\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s press conference to unveil the proposed legislation, Gail Dudley, a small business owner, said that the bill could boost employee morale. She observed that many young people looking for jobs ask about things other than salary.\n\n\u201cWhat are the benefits and is there a paid leave that is going to be available?\u201d said Dudley, the owner of Ready Publication. \u201cThat is going to help us attract the most talent and top talent.\u201d\n\nHahn Burriss of Small Business Majority and the sponsors of the bill both said there could be a small administrative burden to create the system of paycheck deductions but compared it to other payroll deductions, such as Social Security and Medicare.\n\nFor another mother, Miria Biller Hendrickson of Columbus, the cost per year would be small to help families have time at home with new babies.\n\n\u201cPregnancy is a huge ordeal, but then after you have the baby, everything is flipped on its head,\u201d Biller Hendrickson said.\n\nBiller Hendrickson said her husband is a physician who is completing fellowships and that she chose to stay at home, rather than work as a teacher, because it was more cost effective. But she, too, said it wasn\u2019t possible for many families.\n\n\u201cA mom could take 12 weeks paid and the dad could then take 12 weeks paid, and at least that would buy them six months at home with their baby where they can both bond with the child, where they can have more time to figure out what is the best option for them moving forward,\u201d Biller Hendrickson said.\n\nCurrently, only a handful of other states require paid leave: California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington D.C. In New York State, a bill was recently passed to offer parental leave for up to 12 weeks.\n\nThis week, San Francisco passed a law requiring employers to pay full wages to employees for six weeks of paid leave.\n\nIn Ohio, Cincinnati and Dayton both offer paid family leave for city workers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "State representatives unveiled a proposal on Tuesday that would allow Ohio workers to take 12 weeks of paid family leave to care for a sick \u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=380703612", "og": {"site_name": "NBC4i.com", "description": "State representatives unveiled a proposal on Tuesday that would allow Ohio workers to take 12 weeks of paid family leave to care for a sick relative or after the birth or adoption of a child.", "title": "Ohio state reps propose 12-week paid family leave plan if employees have new child or a sick relative", "url": "http://nbc4i.com/2016/04/06/ohio-state-reps-propose-12-week-paid-family-leave-plan-if-employees-have-new-child-or-a-sick-relative/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://mgtvwcmh.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/family-leave-2.jpg", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "State representatives unveiled a proposal on Tuesday that would allow Ohio workers to take 12 weeks of paid family leave to care for a sick relative or after the birth or adoption of a child.", "title": "Ohio state reps propose 12-week paid family leave plan if employees have new child or a sick relative", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwcmh.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/family-leave-2.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@nbc4i", "site": "nbc4i", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "local, mom, motherhood, news, pregnancy Health, Local, News", "msapplication-tooltip": "Columbus, Ohio News, Weather and Sports", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.doapps.android.mln.MLN_09ba3f0df1447f40e98674ba9d62c747", "fb": {"pages": 38342932750}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nbc4i.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/6f1d97944cdcea2214c0f42e5738057f?s=16", "application-name": "NBC4i.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NBC4Columbus", "published_time": "2016-04-06T21:03:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-06T21:08:41+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "Y7Un57nax7y1Nq_Ap5-4MFnKkuvSsOsEzQ67vpVKTFQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "This week, San Francisco passed a law requiring employers to pay full wages to employees for six weeks of paid leave.\nCurrently, only a handful of other states require paid leave: California, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Washington and Washington D.C.\nIn Ohio, Cincinnati and Dayton both offer paid family leave for city workers.\n\u201cWhat are the benefits and is there a paid leave that is going to be available?\u201d said Dudley, the owner of Ready Publication.\nState representatives unveiled a proposal on Tuesday that would allow Ohio workers to take 12 weeks of paid family leave to care for a sick relative or after the birth or adoption of a child."}
