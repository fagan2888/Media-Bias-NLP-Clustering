It's great to see the smiles on faces,\" said Gus Noble, president of Chicago Scots, the festival organizer.\n\nThe festival supports the group's mission to celebrate and promote Scottish culture and identity.\n\n\"We are the largest Scottish cultural society in the world,\" Noble said.\n\nThe event featured traditional Scottish fare and festival foods, Celtic bands, a Celtic marketplace and crafts, a Highland dance competition, a Dogs of Scotland agility show, and a variety of athletic activities, including hammer and sheaf tosses and a youth soccer tournament.\n\n\"We've been coming for years,\" said Jeff Harrison of Glenview, who was accompanied by his wife, Joanne. \"My dad brought us to the games when it used to be in Grant Park in Chicago.\"\n\nThough there were games and attractions for children, such as a petting zoo and art tent, the couple decided to leave their two kids with the grandparents this year to enjoy some dancing and the athletics.\n\nHarrison said his Scottish ancestors moved to Canada five generations ago.\n\n\"I love hearing the bagpipes, people wearing kilts, love the tartan, Celtic feel of it all,\" he said.\n\n\"It's just a fun way to remember your heritage,\" Joanne added.\n\nJim Norton and his wife, Nikki, of Naperville, and their 3-year-old daughter, Cordelia, came to hear a relative play the bagpipes.\n\n\"It's wonderful. There's tons of things for kids to do and families,\" they said.\n\nOne of the big attractions was the sight of men throwing weights around at the Heavy Athletics Field.\n\n\"I like the sporting events. I like the dancing,\" said Richard Barrett of Indianapolis, who was visiting his daughter, Louise, in Chicago.\n\nNearly 20 years ago, his daughter competed in the Highland dance competition. \"It's part of the heritage,\" Barrett said.\n\nLouise, now 32, said she comes to watch \"the men in kilts, especially when they are throwing big things.\"\n\nA stage performance by Skerryvore -- voted the best young Celtic band in Scotland -- had the audience toe-tapping in their seats.\n\nProceeds from the festival benefit Scottish Home, a North Riverside nursing home Chicago Scots has supported for more than 100 years.\n\n\"We're the oldest charity in Illinois,\" Noble said, adding, \"This year, we are building a new building for people with Alzheimer's disease.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Knobbly knees and tartan kilts, wailing bagpipes and haggis hurling gave visitors a taste of Scotland at this weekend's 29th annual Scottish Festival and Highland Games in Itasca.", "author": "Madhu Krishnamurthy", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald", "description": "Knobbly knees and tartan kilts, wailing bagpipes and haggis hurling gave visitors a taste of Scotland at this weekend's 29th annual Scottish Festival and Highland Games in Itasca.", "title": "Itasca Highland Games draw more than 10,000", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20150619/news/150618761/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20150619/news/150618761/EP/1/6/EP-150618761.jpg&updated=201506201911&imageversion=Facebook&exactH=630&exactW=1200&exactfit=crop&noborder", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Knobbly knees and tartan kilts, wailing bagpipes and haggis hurling gave visitors a taste of Scotland at this weekend's 29th annual Scottish Festival and Highland Games in Itasca.", "title": "Itasca Highland Games draw more than 10,000", "url": "http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20150619/news/150618761/", "image": "http://www.dailyherald.com/storyimage/DA/20150619/news/150618761/AR/0/AR-150618761.jpg&updated=201506201911&maxw=1200&maxh=1200", "creator": "@dh_madhuk", "site": "@dailyherald", "card": "summary", "account_id": 8960722}, "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"app_id": 105603449548761}, "keywords": "News, Festivals/Fairs, Itasca, Charities and Fundraising, Members Get More, Video", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyHeraldFans", "published_time": "2015-06-19", "modified_time": "2015-06-20T23:11:00Z", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000529315453"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea6e\"", "article_summary": "Itasca Highland Games draw more than 10,000helloKnobbly knees and tartan kilts, wailing bagpipes and haggis hurling gave visitors a taste of Scotland at this weekend's 29th annual Scottish Festival and Highland Games in Itasca.\nProceeds from the festival benefit Scottish Home, a North Riverside nursing home Chicago Scots has supported for more than 100 years.\nA stage performance by Skerryvore -- voted the best young Celtic band in Scotland -- had the audience toe-tapping in their seats.\n\"My dad brought us to the games when it used to be in Grant Park in Chicago.\"\nIt's great to see the smiles on faces,\" said Gus Noble, president of Chicago Scots, the festival organizer."}
