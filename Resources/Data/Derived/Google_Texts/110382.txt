COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - A new documentary film focuses on three central Ohio girls coping with autism as they prepare for a spring formal dance.

HBO Documentary Films has acquired the TV rights to “How to Dance in Ohio,” a documentary screened recently at the Sundance Film Festival.

The Columbus Dispatch (http://bit.ly/1JCfvEj ) reports that the film, directed by Alexandra Shiva, profiles the three Columbus girls transitioning into adulthood as they go through group therapy sessions and get ready for the dance.

According to the website, the film shadows the girls for 12 weeks as they “deconstruct fear and larger-than-life social anxiety one step at a time by picking dates, dresses, and, ultimately, a King and Queen of the Prom.”
