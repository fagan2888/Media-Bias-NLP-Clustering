Gallego.\n\nWASHINGTON - Two Texas Democrats, Reps. Pete Gallego of Alpine and Filemon Vela of Brownsville, broke ranks today to support a GOP plan to fix problems with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe bill would let insurers keep selling policies that fall short of standards set under Obamacare.\n\nThe two Texans joined 37 other Democrats. The bill passed 261-157, with only four Republicans \u2014 none from Texas \u2014 breaking ranks.\n\nThe vote came a day after President Barack Obama conceded that the administration had \u201cfumbled\u201d the health care law rollout. With millions of Americans facing cancellation notices, Obama offered an administrative fix, allowing insurers to continue coverage under existing substandard plans, and Obama has threatened a veto for the House bill.\n\nGallego didn\u2019t blame the Obama administration but the state of Texas for his constituents needing more time to prepare.\n\n\u201cTexans in the district I represent and in other parts of the state need more time to transition into the healthcare marketplace,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe State of Texas has done little to prepare and, instead, has created obstacles and road blocks for those looking for more affordable plans and better coverage.\u201d\n\nGallego is the only Texas incumbent whose U.S. House seat will be seriously contested by the other party next year. Hours after the debate, the National Republican Congressional Committee decried Gallego\u2019s vote as too little too late.\n\n\u201cNo matter what this Washington politician says, Pete Gallego voted to keep ObamaCare the law of the land,\u201d NRCC Communications Director Andrea Bozek said in a statement. \u201cGallego is part of the problem, and it\u2019s because of him that ObamaCare has been such a total disaster for the American people.\u201d\n\nVela, a fellow freshman, holds a seat viewed as safely Democratic.\n\nTwo Texans missed the vote: Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, and Rep. Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth. All others voted with along party lines.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RyYWlsYmxhemVyc2Jsb2cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vMjAxMy8xMS9nYWxsZWdvLXZlbGEtYnJlYWstZnJvbS1wYXJ0eS12b3RlLXRvLWZpeC1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1sYXcuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Emily Wilkins", "og": {"site_name": "Trail Blazers Blog", "description": "The post has been updated with a quote from Rep.
