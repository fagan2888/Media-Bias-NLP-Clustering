And along the way, viewers see a golfer\u2019s face with a variety of emotions.\n\nSo it was during this year\u2019s Masters, with Jordan Spieth, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson getting a lot of face time.\n\nBut the most up-close, personal scenes in this year\u2019s tournament had nothing to do with championship play.\n\nLate Friday, two-time Masters champion Ben Crenshaw ended his 44th tournament appearance with a round he\u2019d rather forget.\n\nBut that was not the TV story.\n\nAfter making a bogey on the 18th hole, the 63-year-old Crenshaw walked off the green, a smile gradually appearing on his face as he greeted Carl Jackson, his longtime Masters caddie (39 out of 44 Crenshaw appearances), who, because of health problems, was unable to carry Crenshaw\u2019s s clubs during his two-day, 36-hole Masters finale.\n\nESPN provided a close-up view of the taller Jackson, attired in a white caddie outfit, wrapping his arms around the smaller golfer as an expression of the deep love between the two.\n\nThe golf weather gods added to this surreal, emotional drama. Clouds had appeared when Crenshaw approached the 18th green. Soft raindrops began to fall when the two embraced.\n\nCrenshaw\u2019s personal and competitive lives are the subject of \u201cA Walk Through Augusta,\u201d an hour-long Golf Channel special premiering at 8 p.m. Monday.\n\nThe documentary, using archival film and more recent tape, covers all facets of Crenshaw\u2019s career, including his appearances at the Masters.\n\nRatings roulette. Saturday\u2019s Masters coverage on CBS produced the highest Nielsen audience for third-round play since 2011, and the ratings were up 48 percent from last year.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, viewership grew during coverage. An obvious question: How much of this gain was because of the positive play of Woods?\n\nNCAA Tournament wrapup. As you may recall, I\u2019m not a fan of three broadcasters working a live event in a booth or along the sideline.\n\nAnd the CBS troika of Jim Nantz, Bill Raftery and Grant Hill really didn\u2019t change my view.\n\nStill, the trio made enormous strides from an awkward relationship early in the men\u2019s tournament to mostly professional cohesiveness during Final Four play and the championship game.\n\nHill, a former Duke and NBA star, finally found his niche to meld in with Raftery\u2019s effervescent style and Nantz\u2019s old-pro broadcasting approach.\n\nLook for the trio to return next year.\n\nAn announcing spotlight fell on Brian Anderson, Milwaukee Brewers baseball announcer, who had worked several previous tournaments. In addition to turning in workmanlike coverage in the early rounds, Anderson was excellent during the dramatic Elite Eight game between Kentucky and Notre Dame when he was the last-minute replacement for an ailing Marv Albert.\n\nNoteworthy: The 2016 champ- ionship game will be on TBS rather than CBS as the networks begin yearly, alternating final-game coverage.\n\nLongtime Denver journalist Dusty Saunders writes about sports media each Monday in The Denver Post.
