The 17 year old Gulf Breeze High School student accused of killing his mother on Christmas Eve will be tried as an adult, according to State Attorney's Office.

The arrest report indicates William Brandon Adyelott visited the home of his mother, Sharon Aydelott, on Christmas Eve, and the two had a heated argument.

At around 6:20 p.m., a visitor reported finding the door to the home open and stained with blood.

First responders say they found Sharon Aydelott on the floor just inside the door, suffering from multiple knife wounds on the hands, arms, face and neck.

They say she had also been beaten with a baseball bat and had her throat slashed.

William Brandon Aydelott was found at a nearby house three hours later.

They say the teen calmly confessed to the murder when police questioned him.

We're told the teenager had moved out after his relationship with his mother broke down in September.

The victim was a science teacher at nearby Holley-Navarre Middle School, where she had been working since 1998.

State Attorney Bill Eddins said that his office filed a charge of second-degree murder against William Brandon Aydelott Thursday.

Eddins said that the charge is only temporary, and within the next several weeks the state attorney's office will ask a grand jury to indict Aydelott on a charge of premeditated first-degree murder.
