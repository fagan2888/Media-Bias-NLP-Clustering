RENO, Nev. (AP) — Organizers of the Burning Man counter-culture celebration are challenging the enforcement of a Nevada state tax that they say could cost them nearly $3 million.

Burning Man officials said in a letter to the state Department of Taxation on Friday that the festival should be exempt from the recently amended tax on live entertainment, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported Saturday (http://tinyurl.com/nrfm3hq).

The 25-year-old annual arts festival attracted about 80,000 participants this year to the Black Rock Desert 100 miles north of Reno.

Burning Man attorney Ray Allen said the 9 percent tax would translate into a tax bill of about $2.8 million. He said the tax is known by some as the “Burning Man tax.”

“From our perspective, this is the latest attempt by an outside entity to unfairly tap the resources of Burning Man and its participants,” event organizers said in a statement posted on their web site. “Some seem to view Burning Man as the ‘golden goose’ they can turn to when they want money for other projects.”

Burning Man officials said they will not set 2016 ticket prices until they hear back from the taxation department because they could be forced to bump up the cost of entry to the temporary village dubbed “Black Rock City.” They urged the department to respond by Jan. 15.

In June, the Legislature approved a revised version of the live entertainment tax, which originally came into law in 2004 as a way for the state to gain revenue from Las Vegas’s robust live entertainment industry. The revised version became effective Oct. 1.

Certain events — including school, sporting, racing and nonprofit events attended by fewer than 7,500 people — remain exempt from the tax. Burning Man and the Electric Daisy Carnival, a music festival held in Las Vegas, were the two largest events newly affected by the change.
