Police not only should have \"breathing room\" to not enforce the law to the letter and with utmost force\u2014they should understand that it is never appropriate to do so when it involves potentially deadly force over matters not related to protecting lives or property.\n\nIt's nice that speaking colloquially, even Bratton understands the difference between \"actual crime\" and just not obeying officers commands.\n\nEspecially in the unfortunate world we live in when there are laws the police are expected to enforce over selling cigarettes without giving the government a cut.\n\nReason on Garner. Do note we were on this and outraged about it from the start.\n\nReason is your voice in debates about politics, culture, and ideas.
