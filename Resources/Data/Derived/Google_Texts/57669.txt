TeliaSonera didn't reveal the value of its investment, but it will now own a 30% stake in Springworks and will have two members on the company's board, a spokesman said.

The market for IoT solutions is expected to be valued at 9.1 billion euros ($10.2 billion) in the Nordics by 2018, according to a joint report by TeliaSonera and Arthur D. Little.
