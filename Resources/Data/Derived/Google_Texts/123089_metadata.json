And this award is important to her.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to obtain my undergraduate degree, debt free,\u201d Brakes said in a press release. \u201cThe scholarship I receive from Sealaska allows me not to take out a loan. Plus, I only have to work part-time while attending school full-time.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarissa\u2019s story is a great example of the impact the scholarship and internship programs provide,\u201d Sealaska President and CEO Anthony Mallott said in the release. \u201cNot only is she driven to obtain her degree, but she also is gaining valuable experience as a 2015 Sealaska intern with the finance department in Juneau. Both the scholarship and internship programs are examples of Sealaska\u2019s priority on leadership development and capacity building for our shareholders.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s scholarships total $459,000. \u201cEvery dollar that Sealaska contributes to scholarships is a long-term investment into our community,\u201d Sealaska Chair Joe Nelson said in the release. \u201cWith more than half of our 22,000 shareholders living outside of Alaska, we need to make conscious efforts to bring some of our best and brightest back home. As vice chancellor of Enrollment Management for University of Alaska Southeast, I support the recently launched Come Home to Alaska program. It allows a student from the lower 48 with family ties in Alaska to avoid the non-resident tuition surcharge. For the average full-time student, that is a $12,000 annual savings.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sealaska has issued 289 scholarships totaling $459,000 to college students, money Sealaska views as a long-term investment in the community.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/06/13/sealaska-doles-out-289-scholarships-college-students-160697", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/marissa-brakes-sealaska.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Sealaska Doles Out 289 Scholarships to College Students"}, "abstract": "Sealaska has issued 289 scholarships totaling $459,000 to college students, money Sealaska views as a long-term investment in the community.", "keywords": "Sealaska, Native American students, Alaska Native, Native American Scholarships, Scholarships", "dc": {"title": "Sealaska Doles Out 289 Scholarships to College Students"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/06/13/sealaska-doles-out-289-scholarships-college-students-160697", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.date": "2015-06-13T15:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Sealaska Doles Out 289 Scholarships to College Students"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe31dd\"", "article_summary": "\u201cEvery dollar that Sealaska contributes to scholarships is a long-term investment into our community,\u201d Sealaska Chair Joe Nelson said in the release.\nMarissa Brakes, an undergraduate student studying criminal justice at Boise State University, is just one of 289 scholarship recipients for the 2015-2016 academic year.\nAs vice chancellor of Enrollment Management for University of Alaska Southeast, I support the recently launched Come Home to Alaska program.\nBoth the scholarship and internship programs are examples of Sealaska\u2019s priority on leadership development and capacity building for our shareholders.\u201dThis year\u2019s scholarships total $459,000.\n\u201cMy goal is to obtain my undergraduate degree, debt free,\u201d Brakes said in a press release."}
