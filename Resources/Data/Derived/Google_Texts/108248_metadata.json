The president even describes how co-Seinfeld creator Larry David \u201clathers himself in sunscreen\u201d while playing golf.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s caked white all over and it catches parts of his ears, and there\u2019s big globs of it,\u201d Obama says.\n\nIn a typical episode of the show, Seinfeld takes a well-known comedian on a drive in a vintage car to a caf\u00e9 or restaurant. Due to obvious security constraints, Seinfeld\u2019s attempts to drive Obama away from the White House (\u201cJust tell you\u2019re the president\u201d) fail. Instead, they drive around the presidential mansion in a light-blue 1963 Corvette Stingray and get coffee in a White House cafeteria.\n\nObama has appeared on other comedian\u2019s shows in recent years, including Zach Galifinakis\u2019 \u201cBetween Two Ferns\u201d web series and Marc Maron\u2019s \u201cWTF\u201d podcast, to sell Obamacare to a young audience. On Wednesday, Seinfeld made the pitch for him, turning to the camera to say: \u201cPlease try Obamacare today.\u201d\n\nIn a telling exchange, Seinfeld asks the president: \u201cDo you ever think about: Every person you talk to is putting on an act, a total show?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a problem,\u201d Obama says.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Apparently, President Obama thinks Jerry Seinfeld could have been a Jewish Orson Welles.", "description": "Apparently, President Obama thinks Jerry Seinfeld could have been a Jewish Orson Welles.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-14T18:44-05:00", "og": {"site_name": "The New York Blueprint", "description": "Apparently, President Obama thinks Jerry Seinfeld could have been a Jewish Orson Welles.", "title": "Obama In A Car Getting Coffee", "url": "http://www.nyblueprint.com/comedy-film-television-television/obama-car-getting-coffee", "image": "http://www.nyblueprint.com/sites/default/files/screen_shot_2016-01-05_at_1.48.55_pm_0.png", "updated_time": "2016-01-14T18:44:40-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "en", "abstract": "Article: Comedy, Film & Television, Television, Obama In A Car Getting Coffee", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.nyblueprint.com/comedy-film-television-television/obama-car-getting-coffee", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "MobileOptimized": "width", "dcterms.creator": "Maya Klausner", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Comedy, Film & Television, Television, Jerry Seinfeld, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, Seinfeld, ,", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-05T13:40:00-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-14T18:44:40-05:00"}, "dcterms.date": "2016-01-05T13:40-05:00", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.nyblueprint.com/comedy-film-television-television/obama-car-getting-coffee", "description": "Apparently, President Obama thinks Jerry Seinfeld could have been a Jewish Orson Welles.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama In A Car Getting Coffee"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "dcterms.title": "Obama In A Car Getting Coffee"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd253f\"", "article_summary": "Due to obvious security constraints, Seinfeld\u2019s attempts to drive Obama away from the White House (\u201cJust tell you\u2019re the president\u201d) fail.\nInstead, they drive around the presidential mansion in a light-blue 1963 Corvette Stingray and get coffee in a White House cafeteria.\nApparently, President Obama thinks Jerry Seinfeld could have been a Jewish Orson Welles.\nThe commander-in-chief went on Seinfeld\u2019s web series \u201cComedians in Cars Getting Coffee\u201d (a title that tells you everything you need to know) for the show\u2019s seventh season premiere Wednesday.\nObama \u2014 who Seinfeld says qualified for the show with jokes from previous White House Correspondents dinners \u2014 holds his own in a candid conversation with the Jewish king of comedy."}
