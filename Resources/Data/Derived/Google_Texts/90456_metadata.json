Check out eight of the worst attempts at political commentary about Hispanics in 2013 below.\n\n1 U.S. Rep. Steve King Sinks To New Lows AP\n\n2 Mitt Romney Still Doesn't Get It AP\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI think my position and the position of our party is not well understood at the Hispanic community,\u201d Romney said in an interview with CNN. \u201cI want to see immigration reform. I said that during the campaign. I want to make sure we have a legal immigration system that brings, in my view, more people legally to our country. I\u2019d like to do that.\u201d His views on legal immigration weren't particularly controversial in the Latino community. It was his embrace of \"self-deportation\" and his opposition to a pathway to citizenship for the country's estimated 11.7 million undocumented immigrants that bothered Hispanics. After flopping among Latino voters with just 23 percent of the vote in the 2012 presidential election, Republican candidate Mitt Romney continued to blame Hispanics instead of himself for his poor performance \u201cI think my position and the position of our party is not well understood at the Hispanic community,\u201d Romney said in an interview with CNN. \u201cI want to see immigration reform. I said that during the campaign. I want to make sure we have a legal immigration system that brings, in my view, more people legally to our country.

It was his embrace of \"self-deportation\" and his opposition to a pathway to citizenship for the country's estimated 11.7 million undocumented immigrants that bothered Hispanics.\n\n3 Ann Coulter Kept Talking WikiMedia:\n\n4 Fox News\n\n\n\n\n\nIt wasn't the only blunder to hit the airwaves on Fox this year. Bill Hemmer of America's Newsroom blasted the Obama administration for offering information about the Affordable Care Act in 150 languages. \"Now where is it? Where\u2019s that happen?\u201d Hemmer wondered aloud, apparently unaware that an interpretation hotline offering 150 languages is offered in New York City, where America\u2019s Newsroom is broadcasted. In a more light-hearted episode, the America's top-rated news network continues to have a Latino problem. Fox News infuriated the National Association of Hispanic Journalists , with a segment that insulted the children of undocumented immigrants as \"children of the corn,\" presumably a reference to the Mexican diet. In addition to being tactless, the report inaccurately led viewers to believe the state of California was distributing government benefits to undocumented immigrants, when in fact the benefits were destined for their American citizen children.It wasn't the only blunder to hit the airwaves on Fox this year.

In a more light-hearted episode, the Fox and Friends cast learned from their Latina colleague that not all Latinos are Mexican, nor do they all eat tacos. Ann Coulter routinely appears on the network as for her \"expert\" commentary on immigration.\n\n5 'Catch An Illegal' Protest WikiMedia:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proposed protest earned the YCT a In an absurd attempt at satire, the Young Conservatives of Texas, a student group, organized a game called \"Catch an Illegal,\" in which students would hunt for people on the University of Texas' Austin campus wearing signs reading \"illegal immigrant.\" Finding one and turning them in to the YCT would earn participants a $25 gift card.The proposed protest earned the YCT a rebuke from the U.T. Bill Powers . They cancelled the event, which backfired when actress America Ferrera headlined a pro-immigration reform rally at U.T. on the date of the canceled YCT event\n\n6 Mexican Music For Ted Cruz Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nLiesman apologized for the comments. Ted Cruz has faced a lot of ill-informed and often offensive insults from those who say he shouldn't be considered Latino. (As a Cuban-American, he is Hispanic, end of story.) CNBC Senior Economics Reporter Steve Liesman took the jabs to Cruz's ethnicity in another direction, cuing up \"some Mexican music\" to poke fun at Cruz during a segment slamming him over the government shutdown.Liesman apologized for the comments.\n\n7 Rick Perry AP\n\n\n\n\n\nEven that failed to satisfy some, like Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R), who in his more compassionate and rational moments has defended the right of Dreamers to an affordable education and criticized the logic of border fences. In a speech before the Republican Governors Association in Arizona in November, Perry said illegal immigration would Immigration hawks continued to push obsessively for increased border security in 2013. Despite the fact that illegal crossings are at their lowest level in decades and border cities are among the safest in the nation, the proposed comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the U.S. Senate placated them with more than $40 billion in promised spending on border security.Even that failed to satisfy some, like Texas Gov. Rick Perry (R), who in his more compassionate and rational moments has defended the right of Dreamers to an affordable education and criticized the logic of border fences. In a speech before the Republican Governors Association in Arizona in November, Perry said illegal immigration would become \"pass\u00e9\" as the Mexican economy improved -- yet he still blasted the immigration reform as insufficient to address a problem he acknowledged was diminishing rather than growing.\n\n8 Lousiana Official Hates It When Mexicans Learn\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re teaching Mexicans to speak English,\u201d Toups said of the libraries, which he thought was a bad thing. \u201cLet that son of a bitch go back to Mexico.\u201d While most immigration hawks want immigrants to learn English, Lafourche Parish City Councilman Lindel Toups isn't interested . In comments to the local press, he played down the importance of libraries to drum up support for his plans to divert money away from them and into prison expansion.\u201cThey\u2019re teaching Mexicans to speak English,\u201d Toups said of the libraries, which he thought was a bad thing. \u201cLet that son of a bitch go back to Mexico.\u201d\n\n9 Latinos Are American Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral Latino celebrities (all U.S.-born Americans) got hit with such insults, including\n\nHaters bashed de la Cruz on Twitter for singing the National Anthem, presuming that singer San Antonio native was Mexican. The child star handled the episode with class, Hispanics have resided in the territory today known as the United States for almost 100 years before Anglos. And yet, when Latino faces appear before a mainstream audience, haters pop up on social media wondering to hurl insults at the presumed \"foreigners.\"Several Latino celebrities (all U.S.-born Americans) got hit with such insults, including Pitbull Marc Anthony , and 11-year-old mariachi singer Sebastien de la Cruz.Haters bashed de la Cruz on Twitter for singing the National Anthem, presuming that singer San Antonio native was Mexican.
