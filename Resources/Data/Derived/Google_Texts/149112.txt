The caucus will serve as a bipartisan forum for members to develop policy solutions to the nation’s toughest issues.

“There will always be policy disagreements,” said Ribble, “that’s healthy and how our founders intended our government to work. But we can disagree without resorting to kindergarten-style theatrics.”

“Americans hold Congress in a particularly low regard these days,” said Schrader. “The Problem Solvers Caucus will provide every member of Congress with a venue to thoughtfully engage on the challenges we face.”

The new caucus was borne out of No Labels, a national movement dedicated to restoring bipartisan cooperation in Washington.

In January 2013, No Labels unveiled a group of House and Senate members, also called the Problem Solvers. The group agreed to meet regularly to start building trust across the aisle, and co-sponsored various pieces of legislation.
