All these millions of newly insured people were not only going to pack doctors\u2019 offices, but they were all going to be sick with all sorts of untreated illnesses like diabetes and clogged arteries?\n\nThat doesn\u2019t seem to have happened, according to a new report.\n\nIn fact, visits appear to be down slightly over 2013, before 9 million people or more gained fresh insurance under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the team at Athenahealth found.\n\nSign up for top Health news direct to your inbox.\n\n\u201cMost specialty types did not see higher new patient visit rates for the first five months of 2014 than they did in the same period in 2013. Indeed, with the exception of pediatrics, all specialties are seeing lower new patient visit rates in 2014 compared to 2013,\u201d they wrote.\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Obama: 'Affordable Care Act is Here to Stay' 1:52 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nA second report out this week tries to get a handle on how much healthcare reform will cost the country, and projects it will cost $3.3 trillion over the next 10 years.\n\nAthenahealth provides medical services, including cloud-based medical records. They analyzed direct data from 14,300 doctors who are clients, covering 5.8 million patients over 12.2 million visits. \u201cI would say they are fairly representative\u201d of the nation as a whole, said Katherine Hempstead of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, which commissioned the study.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s consistent with other reports saying we are not seeing a huge surge in demand for care,\u201d Hempstead added.\n\nThe Athenahealth team looked to see if maybe it varied state by state. Some states embraced Obamacare, building their own health insurance exchanges to help people buy insurance and also expanding the Medicaid program for low income people. Other fought it, doing as little as possible and not expanding Medicaid. But it didn\u2019t seem to matter, the Athenahealth team found.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s consistent with other reports saying we are not seeing a huge surge in demand for care.\"\n\nAnd new patients didn\u2019t seem to be any sicker, either.\n\n\u201cOne important concern about the transition to coverage expansion was that some newly insured patients might seek care for illnesses that had previously been untreated,\u201d the Athenahealth team wrote. \"Physicians and other providers would then struggle to provide care to these sicker-than-average patients while continuing to meet the needs of their established patients.\u201d\n\nBut when they looked at tests, diagnoses and other data from the doctor visits, the Athenahealth team found little evidence that people were coming in with, say, diabetes that had not been treated for years. In fact, the new patients seemed healthier, if anything.\n\n\u201cFor example, the rate of diabetes in 2013 among established patients was 9.4 percent compared with 5.3 percent for new patients,\u201d they wrote.\n\nIt is possible that Athenahealth\u2019s clients are not seeing very many of the people who have managed to get health insurance for the first time, Hempstead said. \u201cI do think that primary care is changing,\u201d she said. It\u2019s possible many new patients are going to retail-based urgent care clinics, which are offering more comprehensive care than quick stitches or a flu test, she said. \u201cIt is possible, I think, that there could be some new outlets for primary care that aren\u2019t necessarily being captured,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard to tell how many \u201cnew\u201d patients are newly insured, or have perhaps changed doctors for other reasons, such as moving, changing jobs, getting new insurance or something else. \u201cIt\u2019s indisputable that there has been an increase in the proportion of Americans who have coverage,\u201d Hempstead said. \u201cI think what is very hard to tease apart is how much of that increase is due to people enrolling in a marketplace plan.\u201d\n\n\"Coverage expansion has not increased the proportion of new patients appreciably.\"\n\nA second report tries to get at some of the other questions about health reform.\n\nThe Center for Health and Economy projects that federal subsidies for health insurance on the exchanges plus the federal cost of picking up almost the whole tab for expanding Medicaid will cost federal taxpayers $3.3 trillion over 10 years.\n\nThis will probably change, but the bipartisan think-tank founded by conservative economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin projects the costs will be $211 billion in 2014 and $288 billion in 2015. It's something the White House has refused to put a price tag on, arguing only that the reforms will lower overall health spending for the country over time.\n\nThe group also projects that 15 million more people will be buying insurance as individuals in the next two years, as opposed to getting employer-sponsored or government health insurance. \u201cThe individual market is estimated to expand from 35 million covered lives in 2014 to 50 million by 2016, driven largely by the rollout of the Marketplace,\u201d the report reads.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Remember all those predictions that Obamacare was going to create a crush of pent-up medical demand?
