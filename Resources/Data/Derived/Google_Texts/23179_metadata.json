Chuck Schumer joined other pols in calling for Congress to delay parts of the Biggert-Water Flood Insurance Reform Act, which ends federal flood insurance subsidies and, opponents fear, will send property values crashing.\n\nMost residents of waterfront areas are required to have flood insurance to prop up their mortgages in the event of disaster.\n\nBut the cost of that insurance could go rise to $30,000 a year once the federal government draws new flood zone maps \u2014 and Schumer wants to figure out a way to do something about it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actively conferring with many of my colleagues in search of a legislative solution ... to keep flood insurance premiums affordable,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nHomeowner groups said the hikes could severely affect their communities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tremendous hardship,\u201d said Hank Iori, president of the Belle Harbor Property Owners Association, which represents families in the Rockaway peninsula community.\n\n\u201cAll the homeowners are addressing repairs and trying to get back to where they were [before Sandy],\u201d he said. \u201cBut in a year or a year and a half, you could end up opening a letter that says your flood insurance increased $10,000 [or] $15,000.\n\nThe new premiums are expected to lead to a steep drop in property values, said\n\n\u201cThe exorbitant rise in flood insurance premiums is going to have a massive negative impact on the housing market,\u201d said George Kasimos, founder of Stop FEMA Now, which is trying to halt the rate jump. \u201cIt is going to make the 2007 housing bubble look like a walk in the park.\u201d\n\nOnce the new maps are drawn, about 9,500 Queens homeowners are expected to be placed in a flood zone for the first time. And about 23,500 borough families are expected to be affected by the higher premiums.\n\nThey\u2019ll all feel the pain.\n\n\u201cMost families don\u2019t have any additional income in their budgets to handle an outrageous increase,\u201d said Dan Mundy Jr., president of the Broad Channel Civic Association, which represents about 2,000 families. \u201cSome families will walk away from their homes.\u201d\n\nFEMA officials couldn\u2019t comment due to the government shutdown. Ironically, the government is closed in part because Republicans in the House want to delay a different federal act, the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.\n\nctrapasso@nydailynews.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "CLARE TRAPASSO", "twitter": {"description": "The federal government must delay skyrocketing increases on flood insurance premiums, lawmakers demanded Thursday.", "title": "Schumer: Delay flood insurance hikes now", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/schumer-delay-flood-insurance-hikes-article-1.1482306", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1482304.1381448385!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/fema.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.tags": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Charles Schumer, FEMA", "parsely-author": "Clare Trapasso", "parsely-type": "article", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Charles Schumer, FEMA", "news_keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Charles Schumer, FEMA", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/schumer-delay-flood-insurance-hikes-article-1.1482306", "parsely-title": "Schumer: Delay flood insurance hikes now", "sailthru.date": "2013-10-10T19:42:38-0400", "sailthru.title": "Schumer: Delay flood insurance hikes now", "nydn_section": "Queens", "parsely-pub-date": "2013-10-10T23:42:38", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1482304.1381448385!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/fema.jpg", "description": "The federal government must delay skyrocketing increases on flood insurance premiums, lawmakers demanded Thursday.", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Queens", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "The federal government must delay skyrocketing increases on flood insurance premiums, lawmakers demanded Thursday.", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "The federal government must delay skyrocketing increases on flood insurance premiums, lawmakers demanded Thursday.", "title": "Schumer: Delay flood insurance hikes now", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/schumer-delay-flood-insurance-hikes-article-1.1482306", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1482304.1381448385!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/fema.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.1482304.1381448385!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/fema.jpg", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "CLARE TRAPASSO", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd96be\"", "article_summary": "Sen.
