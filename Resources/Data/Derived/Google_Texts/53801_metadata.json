Gilmore and Bradley made it to the June 2 runoff, with Gilmore outpolling him 38 percent to 24 percent.\n\nBradley called the complaint \u201can old political tactic.\u201d But Gilmore campaign manager Magen Elenz said her concern was for transparency.\n\nHer complaint cited a litany of potential violations, including repeated filing of finance reports a day or two past deadlines. She provided photos of items including a yard sign lacking a required disclosure that Bradley\u2019s campaign paid for it; three ads in the Urban Spectrum newspaper that she said were not listed as expenses on his reports; and a picture of a storefront office for which the expense also did not seem to be disclosed.\n\n\u201cMr. Bradley\u2019s repeated and blatant violation of the law makes a mockery of campaign finance in Denver,\u201d Elenz wrote, \u201cand further undermines the trust Denver citizens place in our government.\u201d\n\nOf a half-dozen finance complaints the Elections Division has received this cycle, a spokesman said, Bradley\u2019s is the only open one against a runoff candidate. Some of Elenz\u2019s allegations are typical, but the breadth of violations alleged against Bradley is unusual.\n\nBradley declined to discuss specifics in an interview Monday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still reviewing it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into the weeds of all that stuff.\u201d\n\nDenver elections director Amber McReynolds wrote in a notice to Bradley on Thursday that he had 10 days to correct any violations and avert the appointment of a hearing officer to investigate them. That could lead to legal proceedings and penalties, but candidates usually file amended reports to avoid such steps.\n\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurray", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver council runoff candidate says he will fix campaign reports", "title": "Denver council runoff candidate says he will fix campaign reports", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/11/denver-council-runoff-candidate-says-he-will-fix-campaign-reports/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-11T17:43:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T09:16:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Election 2014"}, "article_summary": "Denver City Council runoff candidate Sean Bradley says he will fix any campaign finance reporting problems cited by a rival campaign\u2019s complaint, including unreported expenses.\nBradley called the complaint \u201can old political tactic.\u201d But Gilmore campaign manager Magen Elenz said her concern was for transparency.\nHer complaint cited a litany of potential violations, including repeated filing of finance reports a day or two past deadlines.\nGilmore and Bradley made it to the June 2 runoff, with Gilmore outpolling him 38 percent to 24 percent.\nThat could lead to legal proceedings and penalties, but candidates usually file amended reports to avoid such steps."}
