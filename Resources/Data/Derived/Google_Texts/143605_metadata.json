Steve Beshear said in a statement this week.\n\nThis year, the penalty for not having coverage in 2015 will rise from $95 per adult, or 1 percent of household income, to $325 per adult or 2 percent of household income, whichever is greater.\n\nState officials have estimated that around 290,000 Kentuckians are potentially eligible for subsidies with the Obamacare plans.\n\nMore detailed figures on sign-ups, age breakdowns and which types of plans are proving most popular one month into the enrollment are expected to be released next week.\n\nA full month into the sign-up period last year, more than 32,000 people had enrolled, but only 15 percent purchased a private plan through the exchange. The remaining 85 percent were enrolled in Medicaid, which was newly expanded in Kentucky last year but now accepts sign-ups year round.\n\nThat same time frame is nearing once again, but officials said they have not determined how many of the nearly 18,000 applications were for Medicaid and how many were for private plans.\n\nBy Tuesday of this week, kynect had handled 116,000 preliminary screenings. Last year, there were 318,000 such screenings at the full one-month mark.\n\n\"I think it will really pick up momentum\" as the deadlines near, said Gwenda Bond, a spokeswoman for the heath benefits exchange.\n\nIn addition to new people signing up who are currently uninsured, about 80,000 individuals who purchased private plans last year will be automatically re-enrolled. However, because premium and subsidy amounts are changing in many plans \u2014 in some cases increasing \u2014 officials encourage people to re-examine offerings from a larger pool of providers this year.\n\n\"You could get a bigger subsidy, a lower monthly cost, or more network options if you shop again,\" according to Carrie Banahan, executive director of kynect.\n\nSubsides are based on income, but are capped at $46,680 for individuals and $95,400 for a family of four. For example, a 35-year-old single parent of two who earns $35,000 per year could get a monthly subsidy of $240; a retired couple with $50,000 in income could get a $526 monthly subsidy.\n\nState health officials said they expected many of the most needy had likely already signed up last year, when more than 521,000 Kentuckians enrolled \u2014 mostly in Medicaid.\n\nAbout 75 percent of them reported they were not previously insured, according to the state, and one poll has found that Kentucky's uninsured rate fell from 20.4 percent in 2013 to 11.9 percent midway through 2014.\n\nAt the Family Health Center in Portland, where \"kynectors\" aid sign ups, things haven't been as busy as last year, when on some days people were lined up outside the door before the center opened.\n\nAgain this year, Kentucky's online health exchange has largely avoided problems that last year plagued the federal Healthcare.Gov, which Indiana and many other state rely upon.\n\nBut while Kentucky is often held up as a national model, some argue it hasn't been problem free. Louisville resident Maggie Noffke, for example, said poor coordination between her insurer and kynect contributed to unexpected policy cancellations and double billing issues that she's still working to straighten out, she said. \"It's been an ordeal,\" she said.\n\nThis year, the exchange has enacted changes to improve service, including adding staff to reduce wait times at call centers, creating an app, opening a store in the Fayette Mall in Lexington and making it easier to compare plans and subsides.\n\nFor those who miss the Dec. 15 deadline and sign up between Dec. 16-Jan. 15, their coverage would have a Feb. 1 effective date. Those who enroll after Jan. 15 would have a March 1 effective date.\n\nTo examine kynect options, visit https://kynect.ky.gov or call 1-855-4kynect (459-6328)\n\nReach Chris Kenning at (502) 582-4697.
