This time a member of the public in the midlands alerted garda\u00ed to a two-year-old boy with fair hair living with a Roma family.\n\nThe children were removed from their homes in west Dublin and the midlands by garda\u00ed, apparently on the basis of claims they didn\u2019t resemble the couples who claimed to be their biological parents.\n\nWithin hours, social media and the airwaves crackled with a growing sense of child-kidnapping hysteria and questions swirled about whether swarthy baby-stealers were operating in Ireland.\n\nBoth families protested vehemently \u2013 but in vain.\n\n\u201cI said take blood, take what you want, but don\u2019t take my kid from me because I never want nobody to take my kids,\u201d said the father of the boy in the midlands.\n\nOver in west Dublin, the family frantically searched the house, producing a birth certificate and passport for their daughter. Neither were accepted as conclusive proof. When garda\u00ed couldn\u2019t find relevant records at the hospital, the child was taken into care.\n\n\u201cThey felt treated like savages,\u201d says Gabby Muntean, a support worker. \u201cThey said the child is 100 per cent theirs and offered blood tests and DNA tests.\u201d\n\nThe suspicions were unfounded in both cases. By Wednesday, both children had been returned to their parents. Two families were left traumatised.\n\nAnd a country was left to ask itself soul-searching questions about whether racial-profiling and social hysteria resulted in State authorities trampling over the rights of vulnerable families.\n\nThe Ombudsman for Children Emily Logan was yesterday given special powers to investigate the actions of both the Garda and the Health Service Executive.\n\n\n\nCitizens\u2019 rights\n\n\u201cWe will make sure that the law is upheld, that citizens\u2019 rights are protected and that good standards of public administration are applied,\u201d she said yesterday.\n\n\u201cI intend to conduct an independent, impartial investigation from first principles. I will not be rubber-stamping the reports of other agencies.\u2019\u2019\n\nA host of questions will need to be answered to ensure public confidence in the child protection system is restored.\n\nThey will centre on the evidence that was available to the Garda and the HSE when the children were taken into care? Was there a credible and immediate threat to the health and welfare of these children? And were these families treated differently to Irish families?\n\nHowever, an even bigger question \u2013 and one that may not feature as prominently in the inquiry \u2013 centres on Ireland\u2019s uneasy relationship with its migrant communities.\n\nHow much do we really know about them? What kind of assumptions do we make about their behaviour? And how complicit are we \u2013 both as a State and society \u2013 over the conditions in which many of these groups live?\n\n\u201cNot all Roma communities have dark skin: there are Roma who have light skin and green eyes,\u201d said Dezideriu Gergely, head of the Budapest-based European Roma Rights Centre.\n\n\u201cThe Irish cases show how easily authorities can act on assumptions or perceptions. This type of action is racial profiling, targeting a group following a concept of guilty until proven otherwise. Since the Greek case, the assumption that their children don\u2019t belong to their families is causing a lot of anxiety.\u201d\n\nAccording to chief executive of the Immigrant Council Denise Charlton, the Government needs to act quickly and provide robust assurances that minorities will not be unfairly targeted.\n\nShe noted that Ireland had been warned in a Council of Europe report in February about the need to prevent racial profiling. \u201cThe events of the past week have done little to reassure migrants that this has taken place,\u201d she said.\n\nMinister for Justice Alan Shatter has tried to ease concerns over the handling of the case and said he had no doubt garda\u00ed acted \u201cin good faith\u201d in both cases, but added he had \u201cconcerns in relation to each of these matters\u201d.\n\nColm O\u2019Gorman, spokesman for Amnesty International (Ireland), said responses to reported child protection concerns needed to be proportionate and non-discriminatory. \u201cThe eyes of the world are now on Ireland, and the Government must show institutional discrimination will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\n\n\nDifficult work\n\nFew argue against the notion that frontline child protection work is immensely difficult work.\n\nKnowing how to intervene is complex and difficult. It requires a careful assessment of whether a child\u2019s welfare is better protected by taking them out of their family and into the care system.\n\nMany social workers this week felt alarmed over what happened and feel it is too early to jump to conclusions. They say that only when the full facts are known can they really draw firm conclusions over what happened.\n\nIt was a sentiment touched on by Karen McHugh, who heads up Doras Luimn\u00ed, an independent, non-governmental organisation which promotes the human rights of migrants\n\n\u201cWe are very conscious that there is excellent work done by those working in frontline services on a daily basis,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAs statutory services, paid for through public taxes and mandated to protect and serve all of us, the onus is on institutions like the Garda and the HSE to create and maintain the public trust.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "State and society face searching questions over our relationship with migrants", "vf": {"unique_id": "wwwirishtimescom11574029"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "407f54448f07f81a1dee976d9c243713"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Irish Times", "description": "State and society face searching questions over our relationship with migrants", "title": "Facebook post and hysteria led to Roma children's removal", "url": "http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/facebook-post-and-hysteria-led-to-roma-children-s-removal-1.1574029", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.1574027.1382736916!/image/image.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 810}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "State and society face searching questions over our relationship with migrants", "title": "Facebook post and hysteria led to Roma children's removal", "url": "http://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/facebook-post-and-hysteria-led-to-roma-children-s-removal-1.1574029", "image": "http://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.1574027.1382736916!/image/image.jpg", "creator": "@carlobrien", "site": "@IrishTimes", "card": "summary", "account_id": 15084853}, "robots": "all", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=365544593", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi", "news_keywords": "News, Social Affairs, Alan Shatter, Carl O Brien, Colm O Gorman, Emily Logan, Gabby Muntean, Karen Mchugh, Paul Connolly, Roma Rights Centre, Amnesty International, Council Of Europe, Doras Luimni, Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, Health Service Executive, Immigrant Council Denise Charlton, Facebook, TV3, Ireland, Provincia di Roma"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNot all Roma communities have dark skin: there are Roma who have light skin and green eyes,\u201d said Dezideriu Gergely, head of the Budapest-based European Roma Rights Centre.\nThis time a member of the public in the midlands alerted garda\u00ed to a two-year-old boy with fair hair living with a Roma family.\nThey will centre on the evidence that was available to the Garda and the HSE when the children were taken into care?\nWithin hours, social media and the airwaves crackled with a growing sense of child-kidnapping hysteria and questions swirled about whether swarthy baby-stealers were operating in Ireland.\nWhen garda\u00ed couldn\u2019t find relevant records at the hospital, the child was taken into care."}
