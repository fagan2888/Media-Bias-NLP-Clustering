A stack of business cards completed the display.\n\nFoot traffic was brisk but lines were never long as customers approached, some with a slice of pizza in one hand and bag of produce in the other. They were grateful, Small said, to get what they needed without being placed on hold or navigating a clunky website.\n\n\u201cPeople come up and say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here.\u2019 It never ceases to amaze me how many people have questions and need help,\u201d Small said.\n\nIt\u2019s still possible to buy insurance in California without risking a penalty, but there\u2019s a catch. Only consumers who tried to apply before February 15 qualify for the February 22 extension.\n\nFurthermore, doing it online yourself is no longer an option; you have to track down someone certified to do it for you. The state website, coveredca.com, has a \"Find Local Help\" button with links to storefronts, enrollment counselors, insurance agents, and county eligibility workers legally permitted to get you across the finish line. Or you can try your luck calling the state\u2019s service center directly.\n\nBut if you click on \u201cFind an Event Near You,\u201d Small is the only one in the entire city willing to leave the office, set up a stand, and offer face-to-face time this late in the game. With thousands of people still trying to sign up, she finds that curious.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why there aren\u2019t more nonprofits and agents doing this. Most people have really tried but they still need help. I hear that constantly,\u201d she said.\n\nFarmers\u2019 markets are fertile ground for prospective customers \u2014 they have \u201cgood demographics,\u201d Small said, meaning they\u2019re likely to qualify for subsidies. She\u2019s been a fixture at the O.B. Farmers\u2019 Market since mid-October, she said.\n\nCustomers who want information in Small\u2019s out-in-the-open format can look for her at the Imperial Beach Farmers\u2019 Market on February 20 and the City Heights market on February 21.
