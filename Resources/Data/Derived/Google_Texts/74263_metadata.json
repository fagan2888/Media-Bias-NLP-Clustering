Arnold Schwarzenegger once referred to as a \u201choly war in some ways.\u201d\n\nGovernment agencies have been studying five major water storage projects for nearly two decades, with nothing to show for the effort so far.\n\nMeanwhile, the state\u2019s water problems have only grown worse. California has had its third relatively dry winter in a row and court rulings have mandated that more water be released from reservoirs to sustain fish species in Northern California\u2019s delta. At the same time, the nation\u2019s most populous state, now at 38 million residents, continues to grow beyond the capacity of a water storage and delivery system that was mostly completed in the late 1960s.\n\nThis winter is among the driest on record, forcing some communities to ration water and leading farmers to fallow thousands of acres that otherwise would be producing vegetables, fruits and nuts for the nation.\n\nThe state Legislature is expected to debate water storage options later this year as it seeks compromise on a multibillion dollar water bond for the November ballot. But California\u2019s congressional delegation has provided a jumpstart.\n\nBills proposed in Congress would authorize a number of projects to expand or create reservoirs. Among the projects are raising the dam at Shasta Lake to store more water in California\u2019s largest reservoir, creating a new reservoir in the Sierra Nevada along the upper San Joaquin River east of Fresno and damming a valley north of Sacramento.\n\nOther storage options include expanding the dams at the San Luis Reservoir in the central part of the state and at Los Vaqueros Reservoir in the eastern San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nAuthorizing such projects through federal legislation would be a prerequisite for dedicating money to a project in the future.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein said those who oppose new or expanded dams are hoping that doing so will deter growth and development, but it\u2019s a losing battle.\n\n\u201cGrowth comes anyway,\u201d she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThen you don\u2019t have enough water.\u201d\n\nFeinstein acknowledges that conservation also is critical to meeting the state\u2019s water needs but said some new or expanded reservoirs must be allowed so more water can be captured during wet years and stored for use during the dry ones.\n\n\u201cThey have a certain prior, I don\u2019t know how to put it, stigma to them,\u201d she said of dams. \u201cBut this is a different day now. And it\u2019s a day that\u2019s been coming for a long time. Somehow, we\u2019ve got to measure up to it.\u201d\n\nIn California, water often is a shared commodity between the federal government, the state and local users.\n\nFeinstein is urging the state Legislature to modify the bond measure on the November ballot to prioritize both water storage and conservation. She would like to see $3 billion dedicated in the bond to developing storage, with an additional $2 billion set aside for restoring the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, the heart of California\u2019s water-delivery system.\n\nDoing so would be intended to appease both farmers and the environmentalists.\n\nNo doubt there will be opposition. The $1 billion proposal to raise the dam at Shasta, for example, would flood part of the McCloud River, one of the most picturesque rivers in the state. It also would inundate several sacred sites of the Winnemem Wintu, a small tribe that is not federally recognized.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Congress focuses on dams amid California\u2019s drought", "author": "Kevin Freking", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Congress focuses on dams amid California\u2019s drought", "title": "Congress focuses on dams amid California\u2019s drought", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/03/23/congress_focuses_on_dams_amid_californias_drought/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/california-drought-new-reservoir.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Congress focuses on dams amid California\u2019s drought", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/03/california-drought-new-reservoir.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "title": "Congress focuses on dams amid California\u2019s drought", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Congress focuses on dams amid California\u2019s drought", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde65\"", "article_summary": "Feinstein is urging the state Legislature to modify the bond measure on the November ballot to prioritize both water storage and conservation.\nArnold Schwarzenegger once referred to as a \u201choly war in some ways.\u201dGovernment agencies have been studying five major water storage projects for nearly two decades, with nothing to show for the effort so far.\nThe state Legislature is expected to debate water storage options later this year as it seeks compromise on a multibillion dollar water bond for the November ballot.\nAuthorizing such projects through federal legislation would be a prerequisite for dedicating money to a project in the future.\n\u201cThey have a certain prior, I don\u2019t know how to put it, stigma to them,\u201d she said of dams."}
