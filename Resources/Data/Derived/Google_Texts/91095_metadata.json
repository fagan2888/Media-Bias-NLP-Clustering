The group regularly discovers new hacking operations and cyber thefts, including a global online bank heist worth as much as $1 billion.Kaspersky said Tuesday that the firm is focusing energy on the Internet of Things, a term that refers to the wide variety of everyday items that are connected to the Internet and thus vulnerable to hacking.\"We have to look at possible criminal scenarios of that device. Are the criminals interested in this particular device? And every time we do that for any device on the market,\u201d Kaspersky said, according to the Boston Business Journal.\u201cSo we decided not to develop any kind of security for iPods. There was only one proof of concept written to infect the iPod, like 10 years ago and that's it. Apple Watches, we don't know. Google Glass? We checked and we said yes. Smart TV? We had a look at it and we have prototype. We don't release to the market because the threats don't exist at the moment, but we are waiting. We are 100 percent sure it will happen. When? We don't know. Smart cars? In future years. And maybe smart coffee machines, et cetera, et cetera.\"", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Eugene Kaspersky said his firm is focusing on threats to the Internet of Things.", "description": "Eugene Kaspersky said his firm is focusing on threats to the Internet of Things.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Elise Viebeck", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Eugene Kaspersky said his firm is focusing on threats to the Internet of Things.", "title": "Cyber expert predicts \u2018very bad\u2019 infrastructure attack", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/235249-expert-predicts-very-bad-cyberattack-on-critical-infrastructure", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T03:39-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/235249-expert-predicts-very-bad-cyberattack-on-critical-infrastructure", "dcterms.date": "2015-03-10T17:04-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Elise Viebeck", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-10T17:04:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T03:39:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/235249-expert-predicts-very-bad-cyberattack-on-critical-infrastructure", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Eugene Kaspersky said his firm is focusing on threats to the Internet of Things.", "card": "summary", "title": "Cyber expert predicts \u2018very bad\u2019 infrastructure attack"}, "dcterms.title": "Cyber expert predicts \u2018very bad\u2019 infrastructure attack"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe4706\"", "article_summary": "U.S. infrastructure will suffer some \u201cvery bad incidents\u201d before officials double down on cybersecurity, a leading information security expert predicted.\nWe don't release to the market because the threats don't exist at the moment, but we are waiting.\nEugene Kaspersky, the founder and CEO of research and software firm Kaspersky Lab, said institutions that run power grids, chemical plants and other pieces of critical infrastructure are typically even slower to adopt good online security than corporations.\nThere was only one proof of concept written to infect the iPod, like 10 years ago and that's it.\n\"We have to look at possible criminal scenarios of that device."}
