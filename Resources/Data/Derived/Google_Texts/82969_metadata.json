Chris Christie and the U.S. Supreme Court on women\u2019s reproductive rights.\n\nAlthough there have been a few legislative victories for them over the past several days, many women feel any gains are overshadowed by two irreducible facts: Christie\u2019s refusal to restore funding to family planning centers and the Supreme Court\u2019s Hobby Lobby decision, which lets private companies opt out of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) provision requiring them to supply all federally approved forms of contraception in their employee health plans.\n\nOn Monday, the day the Supreme Court released its ruling, Christie passed a budget for fiscal 2015 -- with a line-item veto to the Democratic majority\u2019s $7.5 million proposal to fund the state\u2019s \u201cTitle X\u201d family-planning centers, which lost all of their appropriations from Trenton when he took office. The governor did leave intact increased funding for rape and domestic violence programs and maintained last year\u2019s levels for breast and gynecological cancer screenings and treatment.\n\nNow, his veto has led some women to worry that he won\u2019t sign a separate bill to expand Medicaid coverage for family planning.\n\nThe governor didn\u2019t take on reproductive rights in his veto message or answer questions from reporters after signing the budget. But he\u2019s said in the past that the state can\u2019t afford to spend on the clinics. Though his administration has focused new attention on safeguarding women from violence, he\u2019s received a zero rating from NARAL Pro-Choice America and has made speeches in support of anti-abortion activists. That, plus his spotty legislative record on women\u2019s issues, have earned him poor marks from women in and out of his party.\n\nDemocrats are accusing Christie of playing politics with women\u2019s access to healthcare in order to curry favor with conservatives who are essential to his possible run for the 2016 presidential nomination.\n\n\u201cThe battles I thought we\u2019d fought and won -- apparently they\u2019re not won in perpetuity,\u201d said Sen. Loretta Weinberg, who issued the statement that today\u2019s Republican agenda reminded her of the 1950s. \u201cThe fact that this is all still with us is very disheartening.\u201d\n\nFamily-Planning Veto\n\nDemocrats didn\u2019t expect Christie to leave family-planning funding in the budget, but his line-item veto troubled them nonetheless. During every budget cycle for the past five years they\u2019ve included $7.5 million to help support the free and low-cost Title X clinics that provide birth control, STD counseling, pap smears, and mammograms to uninsured and low-income women, men, and teens. And every year since the governor first defunded the centers, which operate with private and federal grants and donations, he\u2019s vetoed Democrats' attempts to restore the money.\n\nThe adverse effects, says Planned Parenthood Action Fund of New Jersey Executive Director Ed Remsen, still reverberate throughout the state.\n\n\u201cThe pain hasn\u2019t gone away,\u201d he said, before noting that the elimination of state funding forced seven Title X clinics to close and others to drastically reduce their hours and staff.\n\nThose who support the governor\u2019s actions argue that patients of the closed facilities can simply patronize another one or seek services from either a family-planning center (similar name, different type of facility) or a community health center, both of which receive primary funding from the federal government.\n\nBut Remsen says it\u2019s not that easy. In 2009, New Jersey\u2019s Title X clinics (approximately 30 of which belong to Planned Parenthood) served more than 136,000 patients, 60 percent of whom used them for primary care. By 2012, roughly 35,000 of those patients had vanished from the system.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know where they went,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he can speculate why they left. In just three of myriad examples, a clinic in Hamilton switched to a fee-for-service model; Paterson\u2019s clinic no longer offers prenatal care; and the Family Planning Center of Ocean County has increased its wait times for new patients from two to three days to two weeks.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Assemblywoman Pamela Lampitt, who chairs the Committee on Women and Children, says low-income and elderly women now have a harder time physically accessing the more sparsely distributed clinics. She also notes that while every county has at least one federally supported community health center and one federally supported family-planning center that offer some of the same services, these facilities are often located in cities where suburban patients don\u2019t feel comfortable.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to get a woman in Haddon Township to go into Camden to a federally qualified health center, but she would have gone to Planned Parenthood in Cherry Hill,\u201d she said. The Cherry Hill office closed in September 2010.\n\nAccording to the state\u2019s Department of Health, six federal family-planning centers have also closed or merged since the end of 2010. Judging from the fact that the number of women seen at 105 community health centers increased by 51 percent between 2008 and 2013, it\u2019s plausible that the majority of patients displaced by the closures are now receiving care at these facilities. But it\u2019s equally likely that most remaining women are obtaining medical attention from emergency rooms or have dropped out of the healthcare system altogether.\n\nNeither the family-planning centers nor the community health centers provide abortions. But 10 of Planned Parenthood\u2019s 30-or-so clinics (of 58 total Title X clinics) do. And while, by law, federal money doesn\u2019t fund abortion, pro-life advocates argue that dollars given to clinics that perform abortions enable them to redirect money that would have been used for other, less politically problematic, purposes.\n\nLikely Impact of the Veto\n\nThe Guttmacher Institute think tank for reproductive rights reports that without Title X clinics, the number of unintended pregnancies in New Jersey would be 23 percent higher and the number of abortions would be 18 percent higher.\n\n\u201cBy helping women avoid unintended pregnancies and the births that would follow, the services provided at Title X-supported centers in New Jersey saved $199.4 million in public funds in 2010,\u201d read the institute\u2019s State Center analysis.\n\nChristie's critics said the governor will make another financial sacrifice in exchange for political gain if he vetoes a bill that would expand Medicaid coverage to family-planning services for women who are not pregnant and who earn up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level. The ACA funds this coverage with a 9-to-1 match of federal to state funds.\n\n\u201cTo me, it is unfathomable that Christie continues to put his political ambitions above the fiscal health of the state, leaving millions of dollars of healthcare funds on the table,\u201d wrote Sen. Linda Greenstein in a statement. \u201cWe should be using all the resources at our disposal not just for the fiscal health of our state, but the health and wellbeing of all New Jersey\u2019s women.\u201d\n\nChristie\u2019s press office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRape and Domestic Violence\n\nThe governor did, however, safeguard two funding increases to rape and domestic violence programs. He boosted the allocation to the state\u2019s lead domestic violence agencies and the New Jersey Coalition for Battered Women by $1.8 million and added $400,000 to the budgets of the New Jersey Coalition Against Sexual Assault and 21 county-based sexual violence organizations. He also maintained $9.7 million for 51 Family Success Centers that offer domestic violence prevention programs, among other services.\n\nThe backing represents the Christie administration's continued concern with violence against women, as evidenced by the 2012 move of the Division on Women from the Department of Community Affairs to the Department of Children and Families. The Sexual Violence Primary Prevention and the Displaced Homemaker programs also moved, all with the purpose of making the DCF the primary agency for overseeing and administering antiviolence programs and, according to its website, to \u201cbetter position the department to strengthen families and sharpen its focus on the occurrences of child abuse, domestic violence, and sexual assault.\u201d\n\nDCF oversees at least one lead domestic violence program -- equipped with a shelter and a 24-hour hotline -- in every county. There\u2019s a state-wide hotline, as well. The DCF also administers free services to rape victims such as a hotline, crisis counseling, victim advocacy, follow-up support, and sensitivity training for professionals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been involved in the whole issue of domestic violence for more years than I care to remember, and yes, this increase is a good thing,\u201d said Weinberg.\n\nWomen\u2019s Healthcare \u2013 Is NJ Doing Enough?\n\nThe health department does house an Office on Women that works with various organizations to promote outreach for women\u2019s health and, according to its website, \u201cincrease service accessibility to health professionals and consumers in the state.\u201d But it last issued its annual report almost a decade ago, and it lists areas of direct focus as cardiovascular disease, disability, sexual violence, bleeding disorders, and caregiving. A link to a purported list of all 21 county family-planning centers and information about other resources leads to some basic health information but no list and no additional resources.\n\nThe site does, however, provide detailed information about clinics that offer STD testing and treatment, along with a 24/7 hotline.\n\nIn signing the budget, Christie did generate a few news mentions for accepting an increase in funding for cancer research and for maintaining $12 million in state and federal dollars for The New Jersey Cancer Education and Early Detection Program. CEED provides outreach, screening, and follow-up to uninsured and low-income patients who have breast and gynecological cancers, among others.\n\nThe Task Force on Cancer Prevention, Early Detection and Treatment in New Jersey reported to Gov. Christie in 2012 that while white women contract breast cancer more frequently than African-Americans, it is black women who suffer higher rates of mortality.\n\nThe task force noted that, \u201cThese differences may result from genetic factors or the disparity observable by race in healthcare prevention and treatment services, which is reflective of access-to-care, prevention, education, and early-detection issues in New Jersey. The latter probable causes should be the focus of our efforts over the next several years.\u201d\n\nBut with the closure and consolidation of women\u2019s health clinics, can women access the screening and information they need?\n\nRemsen says no. \u201cMost of our services are about prevention and wellness. And now there are those 35,000 people we\u2019re not able to serve,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Atlantic County, the cuts kept Planned Parenthood from implementing colposcopies for women who have received abnormal pap-smear results.\n\n\u201cRestoring funding remains our top priority,\u201d said Remsen. \u201cMeantime, we\u2019re going to continue to fight for the people we serve and those we could serve and those we\u2019re no longer serving.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://assets.njspotlight.com/assets/14/0703/1042"}, "google-site-verification": "eSiTqCyhbNrILKPNvPOLORFjlPbqSQLW3WfNOcpjdcg", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "NJ Spotlight", "description": "This week\u2019s budget cuts imperil uninsured and low-income women\u2019s access to healthcare, they say", "viewport": "width = device-width"}, "article_summary": "Neither the family-planning centers nor the community health centers provide abortions.\nCredit: Governor's Office/Tim Larsen\u201c1950, here we come.\u201dThat\u2019s the bleak outlook of many New Jersey women -- particularly Democrats -- as they lament the double assault by Gov.\nAccording to the state\u2019s Department of Health, six federal family-planning centers have also closed or merged since the end of 2010.\n\u201cThe fact that this is all still with us is very disheartening.\u201dFamily-Planning VetoDemocrats didn\u2019t expect Christie to leave family-planning funding in the budget, but his line-item veto troubled them nonetheless.\nHe also maintained $9.7 million for 51 Family Success Centers that offer domestic violence prevention programs, among other services."}
