The former Big East foes haven\u2019t played since 2011, the final season before Pitt joined the ACC and West Virginia joined the Big 12.\n\nSeveral obstacles must be cleared before the two schools, separated by 75 miles, play again.\n\nNeither team has an open out-of-conference date until 2017. The Panthers have existing series agreements with Penn State, Oklahoma State and Tennessee; the Mountaineers have similar arrangements with Maryland, Penn State, Missouri and Virginia Tech, among others.\n\nIn addition to West Virginia\u2019s nine Big 12 games, Lyons said he plans on scheduling two teams from Power Five conferences and one from a non-Power Five conference each year. Three of its next five non-conference schedules with open dates already include two Power Five opponents.\n\nBut for now, a shared desire to restart the rivalry at least exists.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll continue those conversations with Scott and see where it heads,\u201d Lyons said. \u201cObviously, he\u2019s only been on the job for a couple of weeks now, but we did have a preliminary discussion of saying \u2018Hey, I\u2019d like to talk to you about scheduling.\u2019 He was open to talking about scheduling, so it\u2019s just a matter of getting both schools to sit down and look at what we have and what they have open and trying to make something work.\u201d\n\nCraig Meyer: cmeyer@post-gazette.com and Twitter @CraigMeyerPG.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cIt\u2019s a great thing for college football as a whole,\u201d said West Virginia\u2019s Shane Lyons.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "MORGANTOWN, W.Va \u2014\u00a0A son of Parkersburg, W.Va., and a recipient of two degrees from West Virginia, Shane Lyons grew up with the Backyard Brawl and understands what the Mountaineers\u2019 annual football game against Pitt once meant.
