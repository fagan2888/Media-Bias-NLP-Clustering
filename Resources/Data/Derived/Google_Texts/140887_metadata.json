Although state land historically belonged to the Cherokee, Shawnee, Chickasaw and Choctaw, none of the tribes were alerted when the discovery was made\u2014or before the items were removed from the site.\n\nAmong the items found is a shard of bone that later was confirmed to be a fragment of a human skull. Artifacts including tools and other items also were collected from a rock shelter, said Nancy O\u2019Malley, assistant director of the William S. Webb Museum of Anthropology at the University of Kentucky. Signs of ongoing looting prompted archaeologists to remove the items and send them to the museum for research and safe-keeping.\n\n\u201cWe are holding a small quantity of artifacts, including a cranial fragment,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cWe are assuming they are prehistoric.\u201d\n\nThe museum makes an inventory of all artifacts and human remains. That inventory is published periodically and federally recognized tribes are made aware of items that may be of interest.\n\nMore than six months after the discovery, however, tribes have not yet been invited into the conversation\u2014and no one wants to take the blame.\n\n\u201cMy experience is that when remains are found, law enforcement is called out and tribes are notified,\u201d said Leslie Barras, a Louisville, Kentucky-based attorney whose practice includes historic preservation cases.\n\n\u201cTribes don\u2019t always want the remains removed, and here the tribes had no opportunity to express their views,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel the way this is handled is so disrespectful.\u201d\n\nThe controversy began last summer when Williams and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners\u2014the two companies constructing the 27-inch-wide, 271-mile-long Bluegrass Pipeline\u2014sent cultural resource surveyors to Hardin County, Kentucky, to look at a proposed route.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tribes with ancestral ties to Kentucky have not been consulted about an archaeological site discovered last summer during a survey for a gas pipeline.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/22/remains-found-bluegrass-pipeline-route-tribes-not-notified-153695", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/bluegrass-pipeline.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Remains Found on Bluegrass Pipeline Route, Tribes Not Notified"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dc": {"title": "Remains Found on Bluegrass Pipeline Route, Tribes Not Notified"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/02/22/remains-found-bluegrass-pipeline-route-tribes-not-notified-153695", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "dcterms.date": "2014-02-22T10:00-05:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Human Remains, Archaeological Site, Bluegrass Pipeline, Army Corps of Engineers", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "Remains Found on Bluegrass Pipeline Route, Tribes Not Notified"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddfaa\"", "article_summary": "In August, crews surveying a proposed route for the Bluegrass Pipeline stumbled on artifacts and human remains that are believed to be prehistoric.\n\u201cTribes don\u2019t always want the remains removed, and here the tribes had no opportunity to express their views,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWe are assuming they are prehistoric.\u201dThe museum makes an inventory of all artifacts and human remains.\nTribes with ancestral ties to Kentucky have not been consulted about an archaeological site discovered last summer during a survey for a natural gas pipeline.\nThat inventory is published periodically and federally recognized tribes are made aware of items that may be of interest."}
