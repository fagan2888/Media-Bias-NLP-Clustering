David Meeks, R-Conway, said he had concerns about how representative the survey was.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very hesitant and very concerned that we\u2019re releasing information when not even half of the hospitals are even reporting, not knowing what the other 41 hospitals may or may not report,\u201d he said.\n\nThompson told reporters later he was confident the survey was representative.\n\n\u201cThis represented most types of hospitals \u2014 all regions, large and small, for profit, not for profit,\u201d he said.\n\nLast week, a group of Republican legislators who oppose the private option said during a news conference they will call for a new analysis of the program\u2019s projected costs, which they said may exceed official estimates.\n\nThe private option is Arkansas\u2019 program that uses federal Medicaid money to subsidize private health insurance for people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal government is to pay the full cost for the first three years, if the program stays within spending caps, after which the state\u2019s share of the cost is to increase gradually to 10 percent.\n\nEnrollment in the private option began Oct. 1 and coverage began Jan. 1.\n\nAdministrative officials with White County Medical Center in Searcy, Baxter Regional Medical Center in Mountain Home, St. Bernard\u2019s Healthcare in Jonesboro and Ouachita County Medical Center in Camden all testified Thursday that the private option is helping their facilities deal with cuts in Medicare reimbursement resulting from the federal Affordable Care Act, the 2013 federal budget sequester and other causes.\n\nRon Peterson, president and CEO of Baxter Regional Medical Center, said the hospital has projected that its Medicare reimbursements will decrease by more than $40 million over the next six years.\n\n\u201cThank goodness that the private option came about, because that has helped eliminate some of that deficit. We\u2019re projecting that we\u2019ll have about $14.6 million through the private option to assist us with that offset,\u201d he said.\n\nBo Ryall, president and CEO of the Arkansas Hospital Association, testified that Arkansas hospitals face an expected $2.5 billion reduction in Medicare reimbursements over the next decade and that their uncompensated care costs totaled $389 million in 2012.\n\n\u201cThe private option is in no way going to back-fill those Medicare numbers, those reductions, or back-fill the uncompensated care, but we certainly need the private option for our rural hospitals to survive,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A survey of 42 Arkansas hospitals found that most have seen decreases in emergency room visits and uninsured patients since the so-called private option went into effect, state Surgeon General Joe Thompson told a legislative panel Thursday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "John Lyon Arkansas News Bureau jlyon@arkansasnews.com", "og": {"site_name": "Arkansas News", "description": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A survey of 42 Arkansas hospitals found that most have seen decreases in emergency room visits and uninsured patients since the so-called private option went into effect, state Surgeon General Joe Thompson told a legislative panel Thursday.", "title": "Survey: ER visits, uninsured patients down at most Arkansas hospitals", "url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/survey-er-visits-uninsured-patients-down-most-arkansas-hospitals", "image": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_private-option_9.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://arkansasnews.com/news/arkansas/survey-er-visits-uninsured-patients-down-most-arkansas-hospitals", "image": {"src": "http://arkansasnews.com/sites/arkansasnews.com/files/field/media/web1_private-option_9.jpg"}, "title": "Survey: ER visits, uninsured patients down at most Arkansas hospitals", "card": "summary", "creator": "@arkansasnews"}, "keywords": "Arkansas,News,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-15T18:09:30-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "LITTLE ROCK \u2014 A survey of 42 Arkansas hospitals found that most have seen decreases in emergency room visits and uninsured patients since the so-called private option went into effect, state Surgeon General Joe Thompson told a legislative panel Thursday.\nThompson told the panel that according to a survey in which 42 of the state\u2019s 83 acute-care hospitals responded, Arkansas hospitals saw a 2 percent decrease in emergency room visits, a 24 percent decrease in emergency room visits by uninsured patients and a 3o percent decrease in overnight stays by uninsured patients in the first three months of 2014 compared to the first three months of 2013.\nWe\u2019re projecting that we\u2019ll have about $14.6 million through the private option to assist us with that offset,\u201d he said.\nThe survey also found that 26 of the 42 hospitals that responded saw a decrease in emergency room visits, 37 saw a decrease in emergency room visits by uninsured patients and 25 saw decreases in both categories in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013.\n\u201cThank goodness that the private option came about, because that has helped eliminate some of that deficit."}
