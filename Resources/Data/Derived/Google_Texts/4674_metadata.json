A couple of those projects could impact your travel around the city.\n\nOn Monday morning, northbound traffic will be reduced to one lane on North Sycamore Avenue between East 10th Street and East Taylor Street while contractors replace the retaining wall on the east side of the road. A lane will also be closed on East 18th Street near Sycamore Avenue, so the city is warning the area could be congested for drivers in that area. The work is expected to be done by July 15.\n\nAlso on Monday morning, work will resume on Westport Avenue from Sencore Drive through the Benson Road intersection. Westport Avenue will be closed so traffic will be detoured north on I-29 to 60th Street North and south on I-29 to Russell Street. You will be able to get to businesses near the Sanford Sports Complex off of 60th Street North, south on Westport Avenue to 51st Street. Crews expect to be done on this project by the end of June.\n\nHere are other projects getting underway this week:\n\n53rd Street Construction: Jandl Drive to West Mesa Pass\n\nBeginning on Tuesday, June 16, 2015, 53rd Street from Jandl Drive to West Mesa Pass will be closed to allow construction crews to install new water main and perform street surfacing. Traffic in this area should use Plains Drive or 54th Street as an alternate route. Work is anticipated to be completed by late July.\n\nSix Mile Road Construction\n\nBeginning on Tuesday, June 16, 2015, Six Mile Road will be closed at Willow Wood Street to allow construction crews to begin work on a water main connection in the intersection. Work will include installing a 12 inch water main across Six Mile Road. Six Mile Road will be closed at Willow Wood Street during daytime hours. The intersection will remain open overnight. This work is anticipated to be finished by the evening of June 17, 2015.\n\nSanitary Sewer Repairs\n\nBeginning on Tuesday, June 16, 2015, construction crews will be working on sanitary sewer repairs on North St. Paul Avenue from East Fifth Street to East Sixth Street.
