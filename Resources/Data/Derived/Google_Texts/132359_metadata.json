Many who have tried to comply are finding the healthcare.gov website to be more of an obstacle than a convenience.\n\nThe problems with citizenship verification were reported by USA Today Thursday. The paper reports that 310,000 notices were sent out earlier this month requesting proof of citizenship. In order to respond by the deadline next week, individuals need to be able to upload the requested documents on to healthcare.gov.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nSo far the glitchy website has created a problem at every step in the process. As USA Today notes, all Obamacare passwords were changed in April. As a result some people are having trouble just logging on to the site. For those who do manage to get in some are unable to upload requested documents. Finally, even those who successfully upload documents are being told by CMS, the division of HHS which manages the site, that the documents are not being received.\n\nInsurance agent Ronnell Nolan tells USA Today, \u201c\u201dIt\u2019s scary because they\u2019ve sent it in numerous times and different ways, and CMS is saying it doesn\u2019t have it.\u201d The deadline for submission is next Friday. Obamacare\u2019s heavily subsidies health plans are only available to U.S. Citizens.\n\nVerification of citizenship is just one type of application inconsistency that has plagued the program. Back in May the Washington Post reported that the government had identified at least 3 million Obamacare enrollees with inconsistencies in their applications. Most of those discrepancies had to do with income, i.e. someone\u2019s claimed income on an application varied from IRS tax data.\n\nAt the time, CMS was offering 90 days for people to correct these apparent inconsistencies; however, the deadline was extended because there was no automated system of verification. Hundreds of thousands of documents sent to CMS\u2013only a fraction of the total number of apparent problems\u2013needed to be checked by hand.\n\nThe issue of income verification is critical to Obamacare because it can substantially affect the amount of subsidies an individual receives. Those who claim too much income could wind up receiving a smaller subsidy than they are eligible for while those claiming too little income could get too much.\n\nThe latter group is especially worrisome since the IRS will eventually reconcile the amount of subsidies paid and, in case of overpayment, hold the individual responsible on their annual taxes. This could add up to $1250 surprise tax liability for a single person (and double that for families).\n\nJessica Waltman, who works for a health insurance industry lobbying group, told the Post in May, \u201cI have this sick feeling that there are these people out there who have\n\nmade unintentional errors, and in a few years will be subject to massive\n\ntax bills.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare's Glitchy Website Hinders Thousands Asked to Verify Citizenship", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obamacare's Glitchy Website Hinders Thousands Asked to Verify Citizenship", "title": "Obamacare's Glitchy Website Hinders Thousands Asked to Verify Citizenship - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.breitbart.com/t/assets/i/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/blog/2014/08/29/obamacare-s-glitchy-website-hinders-thousands-asked-to-verify-citizenship/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare's Glitchy Website Hinders Thousands Asked to Verify Citizenship", "creator": "@verumserum", "image": "http://www.breitbart.com/t/assets/i/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "title": "Obamacare's Glitchy Website Hinders Thousands Asked to Verify Citizenship - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Deadline, Washington Post,The Conversation,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "The Conversation", "tag": "Washington Post", "published_time": "2014-08-29T12:09:00-07:00", "categories": "The Conversation"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Hundreds of thousands of documents sent to CMS\u2013only a fraction of the total number of apparent problems\u2013needed to be checked by hand.\nThe problems with citizenship verification were reported by USA Today Thursday.\nFinally, even those who successfully upload documents are being told by CMS, the division of HHS which manages the site, that the documents are not being received.\nThe issue of income verification is critical to Obamacare because it can substantially affect the amount of subsidies an individual receives.\nAs USA Today notes, all Obamacare passwords were changed in April."}
