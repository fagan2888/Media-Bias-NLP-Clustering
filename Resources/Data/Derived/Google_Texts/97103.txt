U.S. Capitol Police Chief Kim C. Dine has submitted a letter of resignation to the Capitol Police Board, multiple sources with direct knowledge of the situation confirmed to CQ Roll Call.

After stonewalling release of reports filed by the Capitol Police protective detail that was with Harry Reid when he suffered mysterious injuries on New Year’s Day, Kim C. Dine, chief of the Capitol Police, is reported to have resigned. Bridget Bowman and Emma Dumain of Roll Call (hat tip: Breitbart ) report:

It is not currently known whether the letter has or will be accepted by the three-member board, made up of the House and Senate sergeants-at-arms and the Architect of the Capitol. Multiple attempts to secure a comment from Dine were unsuccessful.

There are other issues aside from the mystery surrounding Reid, whose story about his injuries has changed:

The chief’s letter of resignation also comes amid reports of conflict within the department, which employs 1,775 sworn officers and 370 civilians. A recent CQ Roll Call report detailed growing frustration among rank-and-file officers regarding alleged policies passed down from department brass that officers should not participate in “low value” stops around the Capitol campus. The officers said the top priority was combating terrorist threats against the Capitol and lawmakers, with day-to-day policing taking a backseat. Lawmakers questioned Dine about officer morale at a recent House Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee hearing.

But it is clear that Harry is watching out for his guy:

Despite the recent concerns about Dine’s leadership, he did receive support from some lawmakers, including Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., a former Capitol Police officer himself. “I’m for a strong Capitol Police,” Reid said on March 3. “We need to give them more resources, rather than less.”

As in Alice and Wonderland, things keep getting curiouser and curiouser about Harry Reid.
