Kyshia McIntyre was inspired to give back to her community after losing her close friend Kevin Copes to what she called a “senseless” killing in 2012.

McIntryre, 30, had grown up in Lakewood with Copes and decided there were too few activities to deter youth from violence in town. So that same year she co-founded the non-profit Kids Ending Violence in Neighborhoods, or K.E.V.I.N. Inc., to provide youth an alternative to being on the streets.

McIntyre said the organization hosts programs and events in Lakewood such as a Back to School BBQ and a Trunk-or-Treat Halloween celebration at the local community center.

“It’s not much for these kids to do so they turn to the streets, they turn to the gangs,” McIntyre said. “So we wanted to give them guidance.”

McIntyre has a bachelor’s degree in legal studies from St. John’s University and a master’s in public administration from Kaplan University. She currently works as a payroll coordinator for Student Transportation of America.

However, McIntyre said creating K.E.V.I.N., Inc. has helped her discover her passion for working with children. She aspires to obtain a teaching position with Teach for America.
