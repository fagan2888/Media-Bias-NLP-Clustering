(Photo: Getty Images / iStockphoto)\n\nWhen the Tennessee General Assembly reconvenes Tuesday, Jan. 12, the health and well-being of the state\u2019s working poor will be far down its priority list, again.\n\nIn a February special session and again in March, the legislature decisively rejected Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s Insure Tennessee plan, which he thought had been carefully crafted to meet legislators\u2019 objections about how Tennessee should accept federal Medicaid expansion funding, which would be about $1.4 billion a year, to provide health insurance options for up to 500,000 working poor in the state. The plan would provide insurance coverage for Tennesseans who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to qualify for federal tax credits that lower the cost of insurance plans on the federal health insurance exchange (healthcare.gov).\n\nLast week, USA Today outlined how the U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2012 that stripped the Medicaid expansion mandate from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act left millions of Americans with virtually no options for health insurance, as 20 states elected not to expand their Medicaid programs.\n\nFalling through the cracks\n\nUSA Today found that, particularly in the states that did not expand Medicaid, \u201cmillions of Americans have fallen through the cracks without insurance from their employers, the money to buy it themselves or the safety net from Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThe USA TODAY examination looked at how the Affordable Care Act impacts the working poor \u2014 especially in the 20 states that haven't expanded Medicaid \u2014 and found:\n\nCompanies are increasingly using contract workers for whom they're not required to provide insurance so they can avoid rising health care costs. State and local governments are also contracting out more jobs to small businesses that are not required to provide coverage for their workers.\n\nSurveys show up to 20 percent of businesses have cut or plan to cut workers' hours to avoid paying for health benefits. Employees often say their hours are clearly kept right below the 30 hours needed for them to qualify for health insurance. The companies can cite downsizing or restructuring as the explanation that prevents the cuts from being a violation of labor laws.\n\nLarge corporations with a lot of minimum-wage workers, including fast food restaurants, often leave insurance decisions up to franchisees, who only have to offer insurance if they have 100 employees (a number that is dropping to 50 as of Jan.1). That means the lowest-paid employees do not receive the generous benefits given to workers in the corporate offices.\n\nMany employers offer coverage that's affordable only by the letter of the law \u2014 which says the monthly contribution for individual coverage can't be more than 9.5 percent of annual household income \u2014 but in reality is too expensive for people earning near-poverty wages.\n\nTennessee\u2019s working poor deal with their lack of insurance options by not going to the doctor for checkups and by flooding emergency rooms when they are sick. The bills for the emergency care most often go unpaid.\n\nTennessee hospitals are partially covered for uncompensated care through Medicaid section 1115 waivers, but those waivers are expiring and state hospitals stand to lose up to $500 million in federal funding this year.\n\nThe uncompensated care waivers were to be eliminated as the ACA became fully implemented, and there was no need to pay hospitals for treating the uninsured.\n\nInaction, again?\n\nThe governor\u2019s Insure Tennessee plan would provide affordable insurance and incentives for well checkups to reduce overall health care costs for those caught between Medicaid assistance and insurance exchange credits, but after the way the legislature treated the plan, Haslam is not willing to go back for more of the same.\n\nHe has consistently said that there will have to be a significant change in the political calculus for the renewed push for the plan, and so far it has not happened.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a statewide effort to rally the cause, but I haven\u2019t noticed a changing public opinion and definitely haven\u2019t seen a change in our legislature,\u201d Haslam said in November. \u201cMy sense is there will be a lot of people waiting to see what happens in the \u201916 presidential election \u2014 just, again, to be as honest as I can \u2014 before they\u2019ll do that. We would still love it to happen. We still think it\u2019s the right thing to do. Nothing I\u2019ve seen since then has changed my mind.\u201d\n\nThe governor is not willing to push his plan, and the legislature has not presented any alternatives that give the working poor some dignity and relief.\n\nMeanwhile, Tennessee hospitals face as significant reduction in revenues to pay for healing the uninsured.\n\nReach Frank Daniels III: fdanielsiii@tennessean.com, 615-881-7039, or on Twitter @fdanielsiii\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1OBgB33", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Tennessee's working poor deserve one last push from the governor to pass expanded medical insurance", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Tennessee's working poor deserve one last push from the governor to pass expanded medical insurance", "title": "We need a last-ditch push for Insure Tennessee", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2016/01/02/we-need-last-ditch-push-insure-tennessee/78130116/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tennessee's working poor deserve one last push from the governor to pass expanded medical insurance", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bff3b2047eb63be7ceb7e3caa0c62acc9c99025b/c=198-0-1001-803&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/01/Nashville/Nashville/635845825876685626-Health-Insurance.jpg", "title": "We need a last-ditch push for Insure Tennessee", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Supreme Court of the United States", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Supreme Court of the United States", "title": "We need a last-ditch push for Insure Tennessee", "author": "Frank Daniels III", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4ddf2f07169276ac7136d86071dc6b4a4887910d/c=299-0-901-803/local/-/media/2015/12/01/Nashville/Nashville/635845825876685626-Health-Insurance.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ada357e705f76a69b2b2c90ebea1ad9099b42f21/c=198-0-1001-803/local/-/media/2015/12/01/Nashville/Nashville/635845825876685626-Health-Insurance.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b632377cb5a999462595614c43e650dbca9100e2/c=66-0-1134-803/local/-/media/2015/12/01/Nashville/Nashville/635845825876685626-Health-Insurance.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b84a6f366a4c9d60d01310cdba821b806ef35687/c=0-63-1200-741&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/01/Nashville/Nashville/635845825876685626-Health-Insurance.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-01-02T21:04:54.740000-06:00", "shorthed": "We need a last-ditch push for Insure TN", "articleid": 78130116, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e701db629eadaacfb018ab80a8866487b6b8113/c=0-63-1200-741/local/-/media/2015/12/01/Nashville/Nashville/635845825876685626-Health-Insurance.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bf7b3d4d1d70533f71bcde356528229b7aebe590/c=375-0-825-803/local/-/media/2015/12/01/Nashville/Nashville/635845825876685626-Health-Insurance.jpg"}}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Insure Tennessee, healthcare.gov, Affordable Care Act, ACA"}, "article_summary": "Employees often say their hours are clearly kept right below the 30 hours needed for them to qualify for health insurance.\n(Photo: Getty Images / iStockphoto)When the Tennessee General Assembly reconvenes Tuesday, Jan. 12, the health and well-being of the state\u2019s working poor will be far down its priority list, again.\nBill Haslam\u2019s Insure Tennessee plan, which he thought had been carefully crafted to meet legislators\u2019 objections about how Tennessee should accept federal Medicaid expansion funding, which would be about $1.4 billion a year, to provide health insurance options for up to 500,000 working poor in the state.\nNothing I\u2019ve seen since then has changed my mind.\u201dThe governor is not willing to push his plan, and the legislature has not presented any alternatives that give the working poor some dignity and relief.\nTennessee\u2019s working poor deal with their lack of insurance options by not going to the doctor for checkups and by flooding emergency rooms when they are sick."}
