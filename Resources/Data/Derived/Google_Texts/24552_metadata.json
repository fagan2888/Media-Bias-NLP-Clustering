Haley Veterans Administration hospital without ammunition.\n\nMonte Reinhardt claims her quadriplegic son received substandard care, contracted infections and lived in unsanitary conditions. Her son Army Specialist Robert Bradford was a patient at Haley\u2019s Spinal Cord Injury Center for three years.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t really receive top notch care, he really didn\u2019t,\u201d Monte stated.\n\nSo earlier this year she fired off a letter to V.A. secretary Robert McDonald complaining of \u201cunsafe staffing levels, no respect for sanitation practices,\u201d pointing out Robert\u2019s gums \u201care near rotten.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I would brush his teeth, and I would not be rushed, the toothbrush would be bloody,\u201d Monte added.\n\nShe wrote McDonald, that Robert contracted \u201ca new infection weekly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe would have a U.T.I.(urinary tract infection) and a couple of times it would get to the point where it was just flat out red,\u201d she explained.\n\nHaley would not provide anyone to speak on camera, but in an email, Haley spokesperson Karen Cross wrote, \u201cThere is about a 9 percent nursing vacancy rate in the Spinal Cord Injury Center.\u201d\n\nThe hospital she added pays nurses to work overtime to fill shifts and would never put patients at risk. Cross added at the Spinal Cord Injury Center,\u201dinfection rates are lower than the national average.\u201d\n\nThree other families who spoke with 8 On Your Side on the condition their names not be disclosed, once their loved ones left Haley, their frequency of infections also dropped.\n\nRobert Bradford arrived at Haley in May 2012. He suffered paralysis from a gunshot wound to the neck. Robert did two tours of duty in Iraq, a third in Afghanistan. It wasn\u2019t an enemy bullet that turned him into a quadriplegic. Suffering invisible wounds from post traumatic stress disorder, he attempted suicide in 2011. By the time he arrived in Tampa, his mother recalls Robert was eating a regular diet, moved about the grounds with his power chair and went on outings everyday. However, his condition deteriorated and in March of this year Monte told V.A. Secretary McDonald, she wanted her son \u201cout of this grave yard.\u201d\n\nIn May Robert underwent kidney surgery. Shortly afterward he went into septic shock.\n\n\u201cYour doctors, your nurses and you\u2019re looking at his lab work and you don\u2019t know that he has U.T.I., you don\u2019t know that he\u2019s septic, really?\u201d Monte said.\n\nRobert died two days after surgery. His uniform shirt now hangs on a chair in her apartment. The flag that draped his casket sits on a cabinet beside an urn that contains his ashes. Monte contends Robert received better care while hospitalized in San Antonio, Texas. She wanted him moved to Atlanta, where she claims she had a support system for both Robert and her. She is critical of the Army for moving him to Haley against her will and failing to recognize his post traumatic stress disorder. Now there are only memories, and a message she wants to convey to her son.\n\n\u201cI would tell him that I was sorry that I couldn\u2019t take you home, cause I would have taken care of you way better,\u201d Monte said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "She wanted him out, the V.A., she claims, wouldn't let her take him home.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "WFLA", "description": "She wanted him out, the V.A., she claims, wouldn\u2019t let her take him home.", "title": "Mom questions care at Tampa V.A. hospital", "url": "http://wfla.com/2015/08/29/mom-questions-care-at-tampa-v-a-hospital/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://mgtvwfla.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/monte-reinhard.jpg", "height": 338}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "She wanted him out, the V.A., she claims, wouldn\u2019t let her take him home.", "creator": "@wfla", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwfla.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/monte-reinhard.jpg?w=640"}, "title": "Mom questions care at Tampa V.A. hospital", "site": "wfla", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "8 On Your Side, Florida, Hillsborough County, Investigations, Local, National, News, Top Videos", "msapplication-tooltip": "Tampa News & Weather \u2013 Clearwater Florida, Sarasota, FL", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=567655039", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wfla.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cf19ff68f9fbdc8c04d390d5a0bb86f?s=16", "application-name": "WFLA", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WFLANewsChannel8", "published_time": "2015-08-30T02:47:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-31T17:45:39+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "5OEHfJMvB0un3l6-eQciNHyzjnZPYnJNeXNb1lPupik", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcafbf\"", "article_summary": "Her son Army Specialist Robert Bradford was a patient at Haley\u2019s Spinal Cord Injury Center for three years.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t really receive top notch care, he really didn\u2019t,\u201d Monte stated.\n\u201cYour doctors, your nurses and you\u2019re looking at his lab work and you don\u2019t know that he has U.T.I., you don\u2019t know that he\u2019s septic, really?\u201d Monte said.\nMonte Reinhardt claims her quadriplegic son received substandard care, contracted infections and lived in unsanitary conditions.\nMonte contends Robert received better care while hospitalized in San Antonio, Texas."}
