The power is now in the legislative body\u2019s hands to lay out the broad brushstrokes of a potential strike.\n\nAnd the decision the legislators will make is anything but certain: \u201cThe looming House rejection of the Syria resolution will reverberate for years and years,\u201d Potomac Research Group said in an ominous note Friday.\n\nEchoing that sentiment, LandColt Capital Managing Partner Todd Schoenberger said the president\u2019s strategy faces a sure battle in Congress.\n\n\u201cHis comments (Wednesday) from Sweden were telling: Congress is to blame for the red line. So, he knows he needs Congress to secure the green light for military action against a country that poses no imminent threat against the United States,\u201d Schoenberger said.\n\nMore On This... President Obama's Next Move\n\nBut what also makes the plan so dicey is its cost. This military intervention comes at a time when Congress is only in session for nine days this month, and as it prepares for what\u2019s sure to be a drawn-out battle at the end of the year over the nation\u2019s budget and debt limit.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Continuing Costs of Conflict\n\nNo matter what conclusion Congress reaches, one thing is certain: The U.S. Department of Defense will potentially be on the hook for billions of dollars as a result of an attack. It\u2019s just a question of exactly how much.\n\nThe problem the DoD faces, though, is a depleted budget thanks to last year\u2019s sequester: The billions of dollars in arbitrary cuts to defense spending that hit the Pentagon with brute force.\n\nSo how will America finance another battle?\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no price tag or budget given to this operation. What does that do to debt and an already fragile situation in the U.S.?\" Schoenberger said.\n\nWhile the total costs of the military engagement aren't clear yet, it costs about $1.5 million for every Raytheon-made (RTN) cruise missile launched. Analysts say it's possible for hundreds to be lobbed at Syrian targets.\n\nAdditionally, Admiral Jonathan Greenert, chief of naval operations, outlined on Thursday additional costs of military involvement in Syria for between the 60 and 90 days Congress and the president must first authorize.\n\nA carrier strike group, for extended operations, would run the U.S. about $40 million per week, while a destroyer costs around $7 million for every week it\u2019s in use.\n\nIn a kind of foreshadowing back in July, General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote a letter to Congress laying out possible options for the potential use of U.S. military forces in Syria. In his assessment of limited stand-off strikes, Dempsey said potential targets include regime air defense, air ground, missile and naval forces and supporting military facilities \u2013 and this kind of strategy would involve \u201chundreds of aircraft, ships, submarines, and other enablers.\u201d\n\nHe went on to warn of the implications to the nation\u2019s fiscal situation.\n\n\u201cWe must also understand risk \u2013 not just to our forces, but to our other global responsibilities. This is especially critical as we lose readiness due to budget cuts and fiscal uncertainly\u2026.Once we take action, we should be prepared for what comes next. Deeper involvement is hard to avoid.\u201d\n\nIn stark contrast, George Little, a spokesperson for the DoD, said Thursday the major defense cuts from last year aren\u2019t likely to pose much of an issue.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to sequestration and budget uncertainly, when this country decides to come together and take military action for a just cause that\u2019s rooted in legitimacy of a very strong international norm, then we\u2019ll find a way to fund it,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, despite the back and forth and polar opposite viewpoints form those in the government, Schoenberger only sees this Congressional battle over Syria as little more than a political game for the Obama administration, a way to take the pressure off a high-stakes battle over the nation\u2019s finances.\n\n\u201cDue to sequestration, our military has limited resources,\u201d Schoenberger said. \u201cWhat better way to 1) divert attention from the upcoming fiscal fiasco than by starting a war, and 2) how about asking Congress to increase the debt limit to help pay for military action?\u201d\n\nIndeed, this item of business will likely dominate focus for the nine days Congress is in session this month, while other pressing fiscal issues remain on the back burner.\n\nIn order to keep the government functioning through the end of the fiscal year, which ends on September 30, Congress much reach some kind of bargain before members leave for a fall break, and a continuing resolution is almost certain, according to a research note from the Potomac Research Group Wednesday.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all; the federal government is once again rubbing up against the dreaded debt ceiling -- the $16.7 trillion cap to the nation\u2019s borrowing power -- an issue that must be addressed before 2013 draws to a close.\n\nThe Treasury Department is currently undertaking so-called \"extraordinary measures\" to allow the country to continue funding itself, but Congress will have to vote to raise the cap by mid-October. In the past, debt-limit fights have sometimes roiled the markets -- and helped spark a downgrade of the American debt rating by Standard & Poor's.\n\nPRG said the outcome is more unclear than the almost-certain budget resolution.\n\n\u201cWe think the chances have improved greatly that Congress will approve a modest stop-gap hike \u2013 perhaps $250 billion \u2013 postponing that slugfest until early 2014. The sequester, meanwhile, will continue.\"\n\nStill, the question remains: What happens if Congress passes its resolution on a Syria strike? PRG wonders whether a supplemental funding bill to finance the strike will become a \u2018must pass\u2019 way for a deal to extend the debt ceiling and modify or kill the sequester altogether.\n\nMichael Block, chief strategist at Rhino Trading Partners, said the whole debt ceiling, federal budget debacle is just \u201cnoise.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of concern coming into this month and into next month about the debt ceiling and us hitting that,\u201d he said in a conference call Wednesday. \u201cI think it\u2019s all a lot of noise. It\u2019s been noise in the past. I remember the hand-wringing that went on at the end of the year. And what happened there was we had a lot of drama, and then finally Joe Biden came in and saved the world.\n\n\"You\u2019re going to have a lot of railing back and forth about the morality of bombing Syria or not, and then you\u2019re going to get into what it\u2019s going to cost,\" he said. \"You know, these Tomahawk missiles aren\u2019t free. Look at Raytheon stock and you know that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS/White House,/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS/Government Spending,/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS,/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS/Congress", "dcterms.modified": "2016-03-02 10:00:49 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Dollar Signs: As the president pushes, Congress weighs the political implications of a U.S.-led attack on Syria against the costs of conflict as the nation's fiscal responsibilities mount.", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2013/09/06/collateral-damage-syria-strike-to-hit-us-budget.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/090913/0/0/090913_web_craig_0.jpg?ve=1", "description": "Dollar Signs: As the president pushes, Congress weighs the political implications of a U.S.-led attack on Syria against the costs of conflict as the nation's fiscal responsibilities mount.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Collateral Damage: Syria Strike Would Hit U.S. Budget"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox Business", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS/White House\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS/Government Spending\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS\",\"/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS/Congress\"],\"author\":\"Victoria Craig\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Collateral Damage: Syria Strike Would Hit U.S. Budget\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media.foxbusiness.com/thumbnails/090913/0/0/090913_web_craig_0.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-06T14:41:45Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/2013/09/06/collateral-damage-syria-strike-to-hit-us-budget.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"aa429c4e-4cc4-4b47-9957-a4e3fb7c2d43\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fbn", "dc.description": "Dollar Signs: As the president pushes, Congress weighs the political implications of a U.S.-led attack on Syria against the costs of conflict as the nation's fiscal responsibilities mount.", "dc.identifier": "aa429c4e-4cc4-4b47-9957-a4e3fb7c2d43", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/mediumtile.png", "classification-isa": "whitehouse,governmentspending,government,congress", "description": "Dollar Signs: As the president pushes, Congress weighs the political implications of a U.S.-led attack on Syria against the costs of conflict as the nation's fiscal responsibilities mount.", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/widetile.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/smalltile.png", "prism.section": "politics", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://global.fncstatic.com/static/cq/fb/img/all/largetile.png", "fb": {"app_id": 116027085089150}, "dc.source": "FOXBusiness", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Collateral Damage: Syria Strike Would Hit U.s.
