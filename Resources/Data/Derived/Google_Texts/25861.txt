Tampa, Fla. — When the Green Bay Packers' offensive line took the field in 2003, the opposing coach sometimes quaked and the players frequently gulped.

Chad Clifton and Mark Tauscher at the tackles, Mike Wahle and Marco Rivera at the guards, and Mike Flanagan at center was the franchise's finest unit in 40 years.

Larry Beightol, the Packers' line coach from 1999-2005, recalls as if it were yesterday a game in November 2003 when his blockers paved the way for Ahman Green to gain 154 of the team's 243 rushing yards on 48 attempts in a 20-10 victory over the San Francisco 49ers.

"I remember their defensive coordinator (Jim Mora) raising both hands in the air," Beightol said last week. "I saw him after the game and he said, 'You just killed us, and you kept it up.'"

It marked the third game in a row in which that unit was awarded the rare maximum of 5 footballs in the Journal Sentinel's "Rating the Packers" series. It was a feat unheard of before or since.

They were just that good.

Beightol, 72, hasn't coached in the NFL since 2006 but remains a football junkie. He watched the Packers religiously when Clifton and Tauscher still were playing, and even since then has seldom missed a Green Bay game from his home in Fayetteville, Ark.

As best he can from television, Beightol studies offensive lines like he was still coaching.

For probably the first time since leaving Green Bay, the old coach has come away thoroughly impressed by a Packers offensive line. The Journal Sentinel awards of 4 1/2, 5, 4 1/2, 4 1/2, 4 1/2 and 4 1/2 in the last six games reflect, in Beightol's opinion, the best stretch of line play by the Packers since his great unit had Wahle and Rivera depart after the '04 season.

"It's the best group of offensive linemen that they've had there since (Mike) McCarthy has taken over," Beightol said. "The guy who has really solidified it is (Corey) Linsley. He has really made a tremendous difference.

"I don't want to say that one group is better than the other. I just want to say that the '03 group was the best that I ever had the privilege of coaching, and I'm sure 'Campy' feels the same way about the '14 group."

James Campen was coaching in high school when coach Mike Sherman hired him in 2004 as Beightol's assistant. Campen studied under Beightol for two seasons and Joe Philbin for one before assuming the No. 1 job in 2007.

"He's done a real fine job with this group this year," Beightol said.

Though rule changes protecting quarterbacks and receivers have altered the game in 11 years, the constants that mark successful offensive lines will never change.

"That group in 2003, they were all tough, hard-nosed guys," Beightol said. "That's what I see in the 2014 group as well: tough, hard-nosed guys.

"The good lines play together. They have a lot of personal pride, not only in themselves but in their group. It's something the group had in 2003 and 2004, and I think this group has, too.

"They've got to be physical, and they've got to enjoy that part of it. They've got to get a thrill out of seeing (Eddie) Lacy move the chains, and I think they do.

"A 1,000-yard rusher is important. Ahman Green got five of them, maybe six. Before that, Dorsey Levens got one. That's what those guys thrive on. They want to keep their quarterback clean, and they want to be able to run the football."

In 2003, the five linemen and Kevin Barry, who was in for 202 snaps from Week 4 on as an extra tight end on the right side in the "U-71" package, each played all 18 games.

The Packers amassed five 200-yard rushing games in the regular season, averaging 159.9 per game and 5.1 per carry. They hung 210 rushing yards on Philadelphia in the divisional playoffs before Sherman lost his nerve and punted on fourth and less than 1 at the Eagles' 41 with 2 1/2 minutes left in regulation.

"I just couldn't believe it," Beightol said. "For a group that had distinguished themselves like they had...there's no question in my mind we would have ripped a gash in them and picked up the first down. That was bad."

When fourth and 26, the wayward interception and David Akers' overtime field goal followed, the best chance for most of those prized linemen to reach the Super Bowl was gone.

Roster changes wrecked Beightol's unit in March 2005, and he doesn't want to see the loss of right tackle Bryan Bulaga in unrestricted free agency this March.

In the span of three days, new general manager Ted Thompson cut Wahle and watched Rivera walk to Dallas.

"Just ruined us," Beightol said. "There's no question they need to re-sign Bulaga. If not, hey, now you're screwing around with the offensive line again."

The most telling statistic from the '03 season was just five of the 20 sacks in 18 games were assigned to the offensive line. Beightol was able to recite details of the six sacks in which a lineman was charged at least 50% of the blame.

The improvement in protection by the unit this season is clear. The line has been assigned just 12 of the 28 sacks in the 14 games, far better than its total of 29 last season (all sack totals include playoffs), 35 in 2012, 24 1/2 in '11 and '10, and 30 1/2 in '09.

The current Packers are rushing for 117.4 per game and 4.48 per carry. Last season, with Aaron Rodgers out almost eight full games, their norms of 133.5 and 4.65 were the best since '03.

If the Packers had a low-level quarterback, Beightol has no doubt the line and backs could lead a productive offense.

Beightol coached offensive lines in the NFL for 22 seasons and for the majority of his 17 collegiate seasons.

From left to right, here's how he views the 2014 starters.

DAVID BAKHTIARI — 6 foot 4 1/2 inches, 310 pounds, age 23, 11 sacks allowed in 31 career starts (.355): "He has really improved his overall pass protection. When guys go inside he can anchor down and handle 'em. People don't just bull him over anymore. He can arch his back. There's no question he lacked strength last year. It looks like he hit that weight room pretty good. He has a chance to really become a big-time player. He's pretty tough, too. Penalties (seven) are something he needs to improve on."

JOSH SITTON — 6-3 1/2, 323, 28, 13 1/2 sacks in 103 starts (.131): "He is a mauler and a masher. I think he's by far their best overall lineman. At first, I didn't think he'd be able to play left guard. I didn't think he had the quickness, but he's adjusted. He just kind of takes those three-techniques and gets his hands inside. He doesn't give up a lot of ground on his pass sets. I think we'd be seeing a lot more as a run blocker if he didn't have the toe injury. It doesn't allow him to drive block like in the past, but he still can pull and get down the field."

COREY LINSLEY — 6-2 1/2, 299, 23, no sacks in 14 starts (.000): "He can combo block with either guard. He can reach and snatch people in the run game. Is he perfect? No. But he's pretty solid in there. Those big nose tackles get on him. I think their mistake is, they ought to be trying to come off the edges on him than trying to take him down the middle. He's got terrific upper-body strength. He can use his hands. I just like the guy. I don't see any real negatives about him. I think he'll be there (for years) unless they decide they're not going to pay him."

T.J. LANG — 6-4, 318, 27, 14 sacks in 68 starts (.206): "Without question, he is (a solid starter). He's not as stout, of course, as Sitton. He can get walked back at times, but he knows how to set his anchor and shut people down. He's a pretty damn good pass blocker. He handles guys on his edge."

BRYAN BULAGA — 6-5 1/2, 321, 25, 16 1/2 sacks in 51 starts (.324): "He has come on to have a fine season. In my mind, he shut down (Buffalo's) Mario Williams. He's gotten better through the season. I think he studies these defensive ends. He knows how to take 'em on. He can combo block with the guard. Pretty good run blocker."

Now, here's how Beightol described his starters plus Barry (ages as of December 2003, stats for Green Bay career only).

CHAD CLIFTON — 6-5, 330, 27, 39 sacks in 173 starts (.225): "Chad was a very gifted athlete. Nothing he couldn't do. He was a special pass blocker. I'd tell the guys on defense in one-on-one's in camp what the cadence was and they still couldn't beat Chad Clifton. He could hit a target with his hands. He'd punch and get back off people. Very quick. When he wanted to, he was a very good run blocker. He just would never finish blocks like I wanted him to."

MIKE WAHLE — 6-5 1/2, 307, 26, 17 sacks in 89 games (.191): "By and large, he was about as good a guard as you could have. Good size, height, quickness, could run, very smart, very fine athlete, tough, very committed. Excellent pulling. Above average as a pass blocker. Every now and then he'd get himself out of position and they'd get some pressure."

MIKE FLANAGAN — 6-4 1/2, 297, 30, 8 1/2 sacks in 69 starts (.123): "Very tall and lanky. Had really good snap with his hips. He could get into people. He was so damn quick. He was physical. Very smart and aware. He was a very good center."

MARCO RIVERA — 6-3 1/2, 310, 31, 11 1/2 sacks in 118 starts (.098): "This guy is a real football player. He loved practicing, he loved playing and he loved to mix it up. He certainly was one of my favorites. I wouldn't say he was (a great athlete). We pulled him always going to the left. He got so damn good reading those guys over there, we'd run that stutter weak and Ahman Green would break play after play. He could shut down the three-techniques because he was a battler."

MARK TAUSCHER — 6-3 1/2, 320, 26, 21 1/2 sacks in 140 starts (.154): "'Tausch' was a very smart guy that would study the tapes and find out exactly how the guy he'd be responsible for was going to play. He could counter everything that the guy did. Of all them, he was probably the least (athletic), but you couldn't tell by his play. Good pass blocker."

KEVIN BARRY — 6-4, 332, 24, 1/2 sack in eight starts (.063): "We'd be remiss if we didn't mention him because he was such a force. Oh, he was a killer as a drive blocker. There was no defensive end in the league that could match up with him. None. They were scared of the guy. He was a hell of a football player for me. You had to know how to use him. I loved the guy."

Despite the presence of Brett Favre, the '03 Packers ran the ball on 50.8% of their plays. It was their highest rate since 1976; they haven't come close since.

"We had the inside zone and the outside, the power to the right and the stutter going to the left, and we had a one-back draw," Beightol said. "That's it.

"Teams knew what we were doing but they couldn't defeat the blocks, so we beat their (expletive) into the dirt. Ahman Green was a great back that year, I'll tell you that."

Almost every team nowadays, including the Packers, relies much more on the pass.

Bulaga was the only starter for either line drafted in the first round. Perhaps the most significant difference was age. The current line averages 25.2 years compared with 28.0 for the '03 group.

"They're young," said Beightol, looking to the future. "They really should get dramatically better as they continue to go."
