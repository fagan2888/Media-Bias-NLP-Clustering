Reiner replied, “Well, there again, you’ve got a horrible situation where you have an extreme faction, the Hamas, that controls Gaza,that is written into their playbook, the destruction of Israel. The destruction of every Jew on the planet, you can’t negotiate with that, you have to say either Hamas goes away and the Palestinian authority takes over all that region and deal with some kind of honest broker here, and create the two state solution. The Palestinians turned down the ability to have their own state in 1948 when Israel was formed, so clearly, Hamas, and again, the virulent faction of a, really, uh, strong, uh, fundamental group can control everything.”

“You look at the congress right now in the United States, you’ve got a strong tea party group controlling the whole country, because they have a gridlock, they have a gridlock, uh, stranglehold on Boehner,” he continued. “Boehner can’t make a move, and so for that reason, nothing gets brought up in the congress, so anytime you’re dealing with an extreme group, you cannot negotiate with them, and they way to do it is to eliminate it, with the tea party, you have to go through political thing, you have to wait till 2020 to redistrict, but, ugh, that is really tough stuff.”
