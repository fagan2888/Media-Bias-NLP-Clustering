(REUTERS/Brian Snyder)\n\n4815766\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio has already taken major steps toward dismantling Obamacare.\n\nThe Florida Republican managed to tack on a policy rider to the 2014 Cromnibus spending bill preventing the risk corridor program from bailing out insurance companies losing money under the administration\u2019s landmark health-care legislation, and is hoping to do it again.\n\nThe provision of the Affordable Care Act is designed as a safety net to provide money to insurers experiencing shortfalls, but Rubio says he wants to ensure taxpayers are not on the hook for Obamacare\u2019s failures. The Department of Health and Human Services says insurance companies requested $2.87 billion to make up for losses, but will only be issued $362 million for 2014.\n\nThe senator\u2019s move already won him some endorsements for his presidential run.\n\n\u201cHe saved us money on Obamacare where others have simply wanted to repeal it,\u201d California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa told \u201cFox and Friends\u201d in November. \u201cHe has already saved $2.5 billion by eliminating an unreasonable backstop by the taxpayers for a failed program. He\u2019s been fighting for a lot of things I believe in.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret insurance companies have taken a hit following the implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nMore than half of the Obamacare co-ops, designed to increase competition in the marketplace, have failed since they kicked off in 2011 and even the more established groups have seen their profits take a turn for the worse.\n\nUnitedHealth Group, one of the nation\u2019s largest insurance providers, has also threatened to pull out of the Obamacare exchanges after sustaining sizable losses.\n\nIn a letter written to top members of the Senate in late-November, Rubio calls on members to extend the restrictions, possibly permanently, by adding them to the must-pass omnibus legislation.\n\n\u201cIf the only way Obamacare can continue is for taxpayers to bail out health insurers that lose money because of it, that\u2019s as good an indication as any that the whole law should be repealed and replaced,\u201d the presidential hopeful wrote. \u201cIt is our responsibility to completely shield the U.S. taxpayer from a deal in the Omnibus that might reimburse health insurers retroactively for these losses or any other future losses.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Juliegrace Brufke", "description": "Sen.
