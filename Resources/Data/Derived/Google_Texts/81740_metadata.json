Of which, a legal investigation has proven that his documents provided are forgeries, which is a felony offense.\n\nThe document goes on to state that the president, \u201cwith the help of corrupt politicians, and individuals in authoritative positions\u201d is trying to destroy constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cToday, we again face another day in which we must declare our freedom, from yet another tyrannical, abusive form of government,\u201d it reads. \u201dWe are here, to send a resounding affirmation. We are here, to breathe life back into our Constitution. We are here, to declare our independence.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 a legal investigation has proven that his documents provided are forgeries\u2026\u201d Share:\n\nThe document also includes criticisms of National Defense Authorization Act, the Affordable Care Act, the Department of Homeland Security and the Transportation Security Administration. It also accuses the White House of violating the War Powers Act.\n\nHere\u2019s what it has to say about the Department of Homeland Security:\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is a non-military security force, which is violating the Constitution by using tax money to build a standing army, on American soil, training to engage with the American People.\n\nAnd here\u2019s what it has to say about the War Powers Act:\n\nThey have illegally put our military in a \u201cWar Zone\u201d where they currently, guard opium productions and transport, police the people of other countries based on US law, they get authorization for military action from the United Nations Security Counsel [sic], which is High Treason, and they are exposing, and administering experimental, psychotropic, mind altering drugs for control over soldiers during secret, clandestine operations.\n\nAs of early Friday afternoon, the trucker group had not yet arrived in Washington, D.C. to deliver its list of demand to Gohmert.\n\nThey were also supposed to meet with members of Congress at the World War II Memorial, but apparently missed their opportunity due to traffic.\n\n[blackbirdpie url=\"https://twitter.com/charliespiering/statuses/388697026923606016\"]\n\nHere are some photos of the trucker convoy (via Weasel Zippers):\n\n(H/T: National Review Online)\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) on Twitter\n\nFeatured image via Weasel Zippers.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "\"Truckers for the Constitution\" organizer Zeeda Andrews on Friday circulated a list of demands that will supposedly be delivered to Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert.
