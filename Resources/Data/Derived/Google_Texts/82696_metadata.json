That\u2019s still an open question, of course. But the Court\u2019s recent rulings and Obama\u2019s own seemingly unplugged and swing-for-the-fences attitude on questions from race to criminal justice has given his presidency a sharply re-invigorated viability and relevance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an unfinished chapter,\u201d says presidential historian Richard Norton Smith, who is writing a new biography of Gerald Ford. \u201cBut he has already defied the second-term curse and the wisdom of just six months ago. \u2018What can a president do if he doesn\u2019t have either house of Congress?\u2019 Well, guess what, he can reverse a 50, 60-year-old policy toward Cuba. But, more than that, he can still, even without the traditional televised Oval Office version of the bully pulpit, to a large degree set the terms of the national debate.\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s very demeanor in his White House news conference on Thursday bespoke a renewed intensity and determination to make the most of the time he has left. Much of the time, he fielded questions in a relaxed posture, leaning on the lectern with one elbow, but some of his answers were emphatic bordering on brusque. As the session wound down, he canvassed the East Room for more questions about the Iran agreement with a kind of \u201cHit-me-with-your-best-shot\u201d bravado, as if to show how important he believes it to be. With a blithe air that belied the seriousness of the issue, he quoted that noted diplomat Ricky Ricardo to say that if Iran mined more uranium than it was supposed to, \u201cThey got some \u2018splainin\u2019 to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a measure of the times in which we live that we start the legacy discussion a year and a half before the end of a presidency,\u201d says David Axelrod, Obama\u2019s former longtime strategist. \u201cBut he\u2019s had the most productive period he\u2019s enjoyed since the first two years: Cuba, the climate agreement with China, action on immigration, fast track on trade, the SCOTUS decisions on health care and marriage and now this agreement on Iran. These are big, historically significant developments, in most cases the culmination of years of commitment on his part.\u201d\n\nObama himself said he hoped Congress would debate the Iran agreement on the facts and the merits, but added, \u201cWe live in Washington and politics do intrude.\u201d The sharp and instantaneous denunciation of the president\u2019s comments by Republicans was a sure sign of the parallel universes that constitute American politics these days. Former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas said on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio show that Obama was a \u201cvery, very na\u00efve man,\u201d who \u201ccannot put the dots together,\u201d while Glenn Beck\u2019s daily email newsletter subject line was, \u201cObama continues to destroy the country.\u201d\n\nPlenty of hurdles remain\n\nThe Republicans are not the only obstacle that Obama faces. He won his fast track Asian trade authority with largely Republican support, and the Iran agreement has stirred significant Democratic skepticism, among even the party\u2019s leaders in Congress. If the Greek financial crisis engulfs Europe and spreads to Wall Street, there is no telling what the American economy might look like when Obama leaves office in 18 months.\n\nBy definition, the success or failure of the Iran agreement will not be known until long after Obama has left office, and critics like Adelman worry that even if Iran cheats on its obligations, international sanctions will never be re-imposed, because violations will be so hard to prove and the global investment in Iran will be so entrenched that it cannot be unwound.\n\nBut time and again, Obama has proven himself patient and willing to play what he likes to call the long game, or what Axelrod summed up as \u201cthe determination to resist small, incremental politics to do big, transformational things.\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt America is to the left of where it was when Obama took office.\n\nThe president\u2019s former chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau, notes that almost all of Obama\u2019s recent successes had their origins in things he said and did long ago, including his insistence in a 2007 primary debate that it was worth talking even to enemies (an assertion that many commentators saw as a gaffe at the time) and his 2008 Philadelphia speech on race (which he made over the nervous objections of some of his advisers).\n\n\u201cThis is the long game paying off,\u201d Favreau says. \u201cMost critically, he understood that change on all of these issues would come at a slower and more gradual pace than the perpetual hysterics in Washington would demand. When it came time to actually govern, he put the history books ahead of the news cycles, and our politics will be better off if future presidents follow his example\u2014because the thousands of words written since the midterms about how resigned and defeated Obama is now seem as insightful as the comments section of a blog.\u201d\n\nFor all the travails that second terms bring \u2014 and for the inevitable fatigue the public tends to have for any president after eight years \u2014 there are also achievements that come with the experienced gained in office. Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term was nearly undone by the Iran-Contra scandal, but then burnished by his role in helping to end the Cold War. Bill Clinton was brought low by impeachment, but he also helped broker peace in Northern Ireland and led the calls for NATO bombing to stop Serbian attacks in Bosnia and Kosovo that redeemed his first-term reticence to intervene there.\n\nObama himself has often suggested \u2014 as he did again this week \u2014 that he aspired to do more than mark time, and instead intended to conduct a transformative presidency akin to Reagan\u2019s, which moved the needle of public sentiment in decisive and lasting ways about the proper role of government at home and the capacity for co-existence with the Evil Empire of the Soviet Union abroad.\n\nHistorian Smith, while cautioning that no reliable assessment of Obama\u2019s legacy could be made until decades from now, suggested that there was nevertheless \u201cemerging evidence that Obama may be pulling off on the left what Reagan did on the right.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is to say,\u201d Smith says, \u201ccertainly, if you look at the cultural politics, there is no doubt America is to the left of where it was when Obama took office.\u201d Smith noted that recent polling had found a sharp narrowing in the gap between the percentage of Americans who consider themselves conservative and those who identify as liberal, together with the reality that Obama has the country\u2019s changing demographics and attitudes on issues like gay marriage on his side.\n\nBut he added: \u201cIf Obama moves the center of political gravity, as well as the center of cultural gravity \u2014 which might have moved without him, let\u2019s face it \u2014 but if he can move the center of political gravity several degrees to the left \u2014 we\u2019ve been waiting for a post-New Deal liberalism for a long time \u2014 Jimmy Carter saw the need for it, Bill Clinton gave us a first draft \u2014 then he will be a transformative president, because he will have transformed the political consensus.\u201d\n\nThe very intensity with which Obama\u2019s opponents rail against his policies \u2014 and what most mainstream commentators hail as his successes \u2014 suggests that Smith may be onto something. Republicans themselves have acknowledged, for example, that their dogged efforts to defeat his health care bill, or cripple it from birth, were based on the certainty that once the program\u2019s most popular policies (such as no denial of coverage for pre-existing conditions) were in place, it would be effectively impossible to repeal Obamacare.\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nThe effect of outside events on Obama\u2019s remaining time in office is impossible to predict. But there are clues in the president\u2019s own words about the issues he might choose to emphasize, including overhauling the criminal justice system, which he said on Wednesday was \u201cpart of the broader set of challenges that we face in creating a more perfect union.\u201d\n\nIn the wake not only of the Charleston shootings but other instances of police violence against blacks, Obama has also shown himself notably more willing to talk out loud about the enduring complexities and unfinished business of race in American life. Three years ago, the president touched off considerable controversy \u2014 and no little praise \u2014 in the wake of the Trayvon Martin shooting, when he declared in the White House Rose Garden, \u201cIf I had a son, he\u2019d look like Trayvon.\u201d\n\nToday, if anything, he speaks even more freely, as he contemplates what might have been in his own life, and what he might yet do as president. \u201cThere but for the grace of God,\u201d he said on Thursday, after becoming the first sitting president to visit a federal penitentiary, in El Reno, Oklahoma \u2014 just days after his mass commutation of sentences for non-violent offenders.\n\nIf the clock on his time in office is winding down, Obama \u2014 a reserve shooting guard on his high school\u2019s state championship basketball team whose playground style never quite meshed with his coach\u2019s by-the-book ethos \u2014 seems even more determined to run up the score.\n\n\u201cI think he feels, \u2018The clock is ticking, and why don\u2019t I go for things?\u2019\u201d Adelman says. \u201c\u2019I\u2019m never going to really move the Republicans. I\u2019m never going to move the Democrats on issues like free trade.\u2019 And many times that may have moved him to the edge \u2014 or even over the edge \u2014 of his legal authority. But he\u2019s trying.\u201d\n\nTodd S.
