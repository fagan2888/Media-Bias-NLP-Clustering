Congress Nancy Pelosi's power play 'The tea party empowers us,' the unlikely House kingmaker says in an exclusive POLITICO interview.\n\nPHOENIX \u2014 A week ago Wednesday, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi marshaled the votes to pass a sweeping budget deal that was overwhelmingly opposed by the party actually running the House. Fresh off that win, she hopscotched across the country to rake in $1.5 million for her party at a series of fundraisers.\n\nIt\u2019s been that kind of year for Pelosi \u2014 an improbable stretch of prominence that\u2019s been perhaps the most surprising twist of her three-decade congressional career.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLast November her political career was, by all measures, sputtering. She and her party had just been trounced in the midterm elections, falling deeper into the House minority than they\u2019d been in 80 years. Chatter was building within the Democratic Caucus that it was time for new blood atop a caucus led by three 70-something lawmakers.\n\nBut the rise of the House Freedom Caucus, combined with her skill at managing her caucus, has given Pelosi and the 188 House Democrats far more clout than their numbers would dictate. She\u2019s used it to push through legislation that would count as successes if Pelosi were still speaker and to quiet talk of her retirement.\n\n\u201cIn some respects, the tea party empowers us,\u201d Pelosi told Politico in a lengthy interview here before she headlined an Arizona state Democratic dinner that benefited Senate hopeful Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D-Ariz.). \u201cOur unity empowers us, first and foremost. But they give more leverage to our votes by their ideological stance.\u201d\n\nAs for her own political future, an incessant topic of conversation in the Capitol, Pelosi declared that she feels no pressure to leave, swatting aside suggestions that she might follow John Boehner into retirement.\n\nIn fact, Boehner\u2019s weakness became Pelosi\u2019s greatest source of strength. His inability to corral the 40-member Freedom Caucus eventually cost him his job. But it meant that Republican leaders repeatedly needed Pelosi to pass critical legislation \u2014 to keep the government open, reform Medicare and pass a major budget deal, to name just a few examples.\n\nNewly elected Speaker Paul Ryan is vowing to break that pattern \u2014 no more votes on legislation, he promised GOP lawmakers, that a majority of them don\u2019t back. Pelosi has as much riding on his successfully keeping that promise as anyone: It will determine whether she recedes to the usually weak role of minority party leader or continues to play kingmaker.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say she\u2019s monitoring the situation closely.\n\nPelosi called Ryan\u2019s inaugural speech as speaker last week \u2014 when he spoke of the need to empower a \u201cneglected minority\u201d of Republicans \u2014 \u201ca little scary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was really a speech to the Freedom Caucus, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d she said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nRyan has had two polar opposite reputations among Democrats: the entitlement- and welfare-slashing ideologue turned into an election-season boogeyman; or the reasonable guy willing to take half a loaf for the sake of progress who cut a major spending deal with liberal Sen. Patty Murray two years ago.\n\nPelosi said she\u2019s reserving judgment on which version she subscribes to until she has more direct experience with the new GOP leader. The coming weeks will provide her a hefty sample, as Congress faces deadlines on must-pass government spending legislation.\n\nShe and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid are already laying out conditions: no controversial GOP riders, such as those to defund Planned Parenthood, and no more kick-the-can spending bills; Congress needs to fix the problem for at least a year.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what we can agree on, but we\u2019re not going to have [riders],\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cWe move together.\u201d\n\nHer ability to make such demands stems from her strong position in her caucus. Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), a moderate Democrat who was one of the staunchest critics of the Democrats\u2019 message during the 2014 election, said he\u2019s seen a dramatic shift in how the party is talking to voters since last November.\n\nHe attributed that to Pelosi widening her inner circle of confidants, including enlisting roughly a dozen younger lawmakers into a new messaging arm of the party.\n\n\u201cShe is on a roll and has been for the last few months,\u201d Connolly said. \u201cThis is probably her best year since 2009.\u201d That was the year she steered a massive government stimulus bill and financial reform legislation through the House, and paved the way for passage of Obamacare.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a favorite pastime of House Democrats to speculate when Pelosi will move on. After Reid said in the spring this would be his final term and Boehner abruptly resigned months later, many thought Pelosi would be next.\n\nBut Pelosi said that other leaders\u2019 decisions to retire have had no effect on her: \u201cIt has nothing to do with me.\u201d She\u2019ll stay, she said, as long as Democrats want her.\n\nPelosi added that she sees one of her chief roles as being the protector of Obamacare and that she has no intention of leaving when the law is still under fire from Republicans.\n\n\u201cMy main mission and best accomplishment, of course, is the Affordable Care Act, which is continually under assault,\u201d she said.\n\nLast month, Pelosi also gave her strongest signal to date that she has no plans of retiring after the 2016 elections. In the midst of the Republican leader election, when she was nominated by Democrats for speaker, she joked that she was asking for her caucus\u2019 vote for speaker \u201csooner than I expected to ask again.\u201d\n\nFor now, Democrats are squarely behind Pelosi. The post-election grumbling has subsided, and the party is once again turning toward its most prolific congressional fundraiser to bolster its candidates in 2016. The party is so deep in the hole, though, it probably won\u2019t have a realistic shot at retaking the House until the end of the decade or later.\n\nSome of the more recently elected Democrats are still pushing for a clearer path to move up party ranks. The election of Ryan, who is three decades younger than any of the top three Democratic leaders, has reinvigorated that talk.\n\nPelosi has been trying to accommodate their concerns. She created a messaging committee and a voting rights-focused group that is stacked with newer House Democrats, along with some of her close allies.\n\nShe has also worked to raise the profile of younger members. During a news event last week in Phoenix, Pelosi praised first-term Rep. Ruben Gallego as the \u201cfuture\u201d of the caucus.\n\nDemocrats also know that if Pelosi leaves, she\u2019ll depart with a network of donors unmatched in their ranks. She is one of the most successful nonpresidential fundraisers in history.\n\nJust in the past week, a Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee event that she hosted with Obama raised $500,000. A few days later, she was on hand for a 50-person dinner hosted by Jonathan Allan Soros \u2014 Obama was also in attendance \u2014 that brought in $1 million.\n\nThat brought Pelosi\u2019s haul to $32.7 million for this election cycle \u2014 after doing 172 fundraising events in 29 cities just this year. Since entering Democratic leadership in 2002, she has raised $461.5 million, according to her staff.\n\nAt the fundraiser for Kirkpatrick, who is challenging Republican Sen. John McCain in 2016, Pelosi energetically worked the room. She stopped for photos with interns and top-tier donors after having spent a bulk of the afternoon meeting one-on-one with party funders.\n\nPelosi spends so much time on the road that the California Democrat recently reached 3 million miles on United Airlines.\n\nThe challenge now is to translate money into seats. Democrats have struggled with that since 2010.\n\nPelosi and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (D-N.M.) have forged a campaign strategy that tailors the party\u2019s message to individual districts, as opposed to a one-size-fit-all approach. They\u2019re staying away from niche economic issues like paycheck inequality and the minimum wage, which were seen as a loser for many Democratic House hopefuls last year.\n\nLuj\u00e1n said Pelosi tasked him with coming up with a new way of reaching voters who would likely vote Democrat but aren\u2019t motivated to get to the polls.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re focused on having Democratic incumbents and candidates speaking in the right way in their districts,\u201d Luj\u00e1n said. \u201cWe\u2019re hearing the same message, we\u2019re just using a different way of communicating that.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s turnabout over the past nine months has surprised even some of her longtime supporters.\n\nIt started when the House was on the verge of a government shutdown, and Boehner in need of Democrats\u2019 help. Conservatives wanted to shut down the Department of Homeland Security to halt a series of executive orders from President Barack Obama on immigration. Pelosi and Boehner joined forces to prevent a federal closure, relying overwhelmingly on Democratic votes.\n\nWeeks later, she teamed with Boehner again to clinch a $200 billion package that overhauled how the government reimburses Medicare doctors. It fixed a problem that had persisted for decades.\n\nBut Pelosi\u2019s biggest win this year was getting more than 160 Democrats to back the nuclear deal with Iran, including a number of senior Jewish Democrats who were initially wary. The whip operation became a personal crusade for Pelosi, who kept a three-ring binder of supportive statements and sent handwritten notes to lawmakers who pledged their vote \u2014 a tactic she\u2019s used to build relationships for decades. She is also sending out personalized notes thanking members for voting for the budget deal.\n\nHer leverage does have limits, however. Pelosi was widely criticized by lawmakers for what they viewed as a muddled strategy on key trade legislation that passed the House in June. She didn\u2019t disclose her position until just minutes before the vote, when she opted to buck Obama and vote against it. Undecided Democrats said at the time they would have appreciated clearer direction from their leader.\n\nPelosi said that had she come out early against the bill, it would have doomed the White House\u2019s hopes of passing the bill. Instead, she waited until the end to give Obama the chance to persuade as many moderate lawmakers as possible to support trade powers.\n\nThe Democrats who opposed the bill were \u201cnever\u201d going to change their minds, \u201cand the ones who did want it thanked me for giving them the leeway,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThere was no way it was going to turn out any differently than it did.\u201d\n\nAny ill will between Pelosi and Obama or fellow Democrats was short-lived.\n\nAnd after Boehner retired, he practically skipped through the halls of Congress in a wave of apparent relief. If that got Pelosi thinking what her own post-Congress life might be like, she wouldn\u2019t admit it.\n\n\u201cPeople keep saying, \u2018What are you going to do when you leave here?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cDo I have to do something? Why do I have to do anything when I leave here?\u201d\n\nPelosi did concede looking forward to a few things when she does finally leave: \u201cRead, (go) to plays and symphonies and movies, and be with my grandchildren.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;The tea party empowers us,&quot; the unlikely House kingmaker says in an exclusive POLITICO interview.", "title": "Nancy Pelosi's power play", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/nancy-pelosi-congress-interview-215528", "image": "http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201511/3619/1155968404_4596913178001_140731-DTD-00-02-16-24-Still322.jpg?pubId=1155968404", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "&quot;The tea party empowers us,&quot; the unlikely House kingmaker says in an exclusive POLITICO interview.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Congress Nancy Pelosi's power play 'The tea party empowers us,' the unlikely House kingmaker says in an exclusive POLITICO interview.\nChatter was building within the Democratic Caucus that it was time for new blood atop a caucus led by three 70-something lawmakers.\nShe created a messaging committee and a voting rights-focused group that is stacked with newer House Democrats, along with some of her close allies.\nThey\u2019re staying away from niche economic issues like paycheck inequality and the minimum wage, which were seen as a loser for many Democratic House hopefuls last year.\nStill, it\u2019s a favorite pastime of House Democrats to speculate when Pelosi will move on."}
