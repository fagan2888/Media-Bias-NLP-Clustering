The Supreme Court has seven cases for which it still needs to issue opinions.

One of those is Obergefell v. Hodges, which looks at state bans on same-sex marriage. The other is King v. Burwell, which presents the latest challenge to President Barack Obama's landmark health care law, the Affordable Care Act. A ruling against the Obama Administration could yank tax subsidies that help low-income Americans afford insurance in federal marketplaces.

Maps from the Kaiser Family Foundation show the wide-ranging impact of a potential ruling against the law.

The ruling would affect Americans in states relying on the federal marketplace. Although some states have set up their own state exchanges — California, Washington and Maryland, for example — most states haven't.

The Department of Health and Human Services has said that 6.4 million Americans will lose their health insurance because they will not be able to afford it without the subsidies.

A ruling against the law would pose a large challenge to states like Texas and Florida, which are highly populous and have more people living below or near the poverty line. These states stand to lose the most in tax credit dollars.

The result will be sky-rocketing premiums — with some people facing an increase as high as 650 percent.
