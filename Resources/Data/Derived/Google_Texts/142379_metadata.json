A lot of very essential functionality of the university is funneled through our systems. At least 115 ongoing projects currently require FTP.\"\n\nHowever, some secure file transfer systems on the market are designed for huge corporations. Northwestern needed only a fraction of the functionality of those systems and didn't want the added complexity and cost that comes with them. Ultimately, their search led them to GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer by Linoma Software.\n\nThe university now runs GoAnywhere on a Linux 5 server, and the system eliminates the need for custom scripts, single-function tools and manual processes, according to a case study on the company's site. GoAnywhere \"automatically encrypts files with AES-256, compresses and decompresses files, connects to other secure FTP servers, and guarantees file delivery with connection retries and file auto-resume.\" The system also replicates data between database servers and translates between file formats\n\n\"I would say it's extremely flexible,\" said Blitz in the case study. \"It's easy to construct a script-like process without writing any code. Customizing transfers specific to each trading partner takes minutes and is often just a simple 'drag-n-drop' or right-click away from being ready for Production.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "Northwestern University in Evanston, IL has implemented a new file transfer system to securely send files between the university and external vendors or agencies.", "og": {"url": "https://campustechnology.com/articles/2016/02/10/northwestern-u-updates-file-transfer-tools.aspx", "image": "https://campustechnology.com/~/media/EDU/CampusTechnology/CTlogo.jpg", "site_name": "Campus Technology", "description": "Northwestern University in Evanston, IL has implemented a new file transfer system to securely send files between the university and external vendors or agencies.", "title": "Northwestern U Updates File Transfer Tools -- Campus Technology"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "msapplication-TileImage": "/design/EDU/campustechnology/img/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "information security for schools, data security for schools, secure file transfer for schools, Northwestern University, GoAnywhere, classroom technology, information technology, school technology, campus technology, educational technology", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "SecurityNorthwestern U Updates File Transfer ToolsNorthwestern University in Evanston, IL has implemented a new file transfer system to securely send files between the university and external vendors or agencies.\nHowever, some secure file transfer systems on the market are designed for huge corporations.\nUltimately, their search led them to GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer by Linoma Software.\nGoAnywhere \"automatically encrypts files with AES-256, compresses and decompresses files, connects to other secure FTP servers, and guarantees file delivery with connection retries and file auto-resume.\"\nThe system also replicates data between database servers and translates between file formats\"I would say it's extremely flexible,\" said Blitz in the case study."}
