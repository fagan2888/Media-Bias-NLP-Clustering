And I\u2019m not running for office, and so my only interest is in success. And if I\u2019m down in the situation and I\u2019m talking to people who have worked in these regions and have run major military operations from the chairman of my Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joe Dunford, to individuals like Gen. Allen, who was involved in Iraqi operations in 2007, 2008. And if they don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy, then it\u2019s probably not easy.\"\n\nObama's response comes after Carson gave a vague, confused explanation of what he would do to defeat ISIL in Syria during Tuesday's debate. \"In order to make them look like losers, we have to destroy their caliphate,\" Carson said. \"And you look for the easiest place to do that? It would be in Iraq. And if \u2014 outside of Anbar in Iraq, there\u2019s a big energy field. Take that from them. Take all of that land from them. We could do that, I believe, fairly easily, I\u2019ve learned from talking to several generals, and then you move on from there.\"\n\nThe president's interview was recorded hours before Carson's chief rival, Donald Trump, declared to a Fort Dodge, Iowa, audience that he would \"bomb the sh--\" out of the Islamic State's oil fields in order to defeat the group. In the past, Trump has said that he would \"bomb the hell\" out of them and take the group's oil holdings as well.\n\n\"I would just bomb those suckers,\" Trump pledged. \"And, that's right, I'd blow up all of the pipes, I'd blow up the refineries, I'd blow up every single inch. There would be nothing left. And you know what? You'll get Exxon to come in there and in two months \u2014 you ever see these guys, how good they are, the great oil companies? They'll rebuild that sucker brand-new. It will be beautiful. And I'd rig it, and I'd take the oil. I said, I'll take the oil.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "&quot;What I think is that he doesn\u2019t know much about it,&quot; the president said with a chuckle.", "title": "Obama rips Carson: Destroying the Islamic State isn't 'easy'", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/obama-ben-carson-isil-215822", "image": "http://static.politico.com/eb/6a/e705712e436494bc345177eea26c/obama-gma-screengrab.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NickGassReports"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "&quot;What I think is that he doesn\u2019t know much about it,&quot; the president said with a chuckle.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "| POLITICO screen grab Obama rips Carson: Destroying the Islamic State isn't 'easy'Ben Carson does not know much about the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, President Barack Obama says.\n\"And, that's right, I'd blow up all of the pipes, I'd blow up the refineries, I'd blow up every single inch.\n\"In order to make them look like losers, we have to destroy their caliphate,\" Carson said.\nAnd if they don\u2019t think it\u2019s easy, then it\u2019s probably not easy.\"\nObama's response comes after Carson gave a vague, confused explanation of what he would do to defeat ISIL in Syria during Tuesday's debate."}
