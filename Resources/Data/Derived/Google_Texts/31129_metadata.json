King\u2019s little-known opponent consistently attacked King during the hour-long event.\n\nThe constant barrage was so over the top that audience members gasped and chuckled at times during Mowrer\u2019s persistent negativity. The Democrat contestant often opted not to answer the moderators\u2019 questions, choosing instead to criticize his opponent. Congressman King was clearly annoyed at the unyielding attacks, but did a good job maintaining his composure.\n\n\u201cWe have a representative with a record of never working with anyone across the aisle to get the job done,\u201d Mowrer claimed in his opening comments.\n\nThat type of hyperbole undermined Mowrer\u2019s efforts. Is Steve King a conservative firebrand? Yes. Is Steve King adamant in his opposition to President Obama\u2019s liberal agenda? Of course. But to claim he has \u201cnever\u201d worked with anyone across the aisle is blatantly false.\n\nIn fact, you can find many instances where Congressman King worked across the aisle with other members of the Iowa delegation and beyond. One example cited by King during the debate was the Farm Bill.\n\n\u201cThat was my job, reaching across the aisle. That\u2019s why we were able to get a bipartisan vote and in the end, we got a good Farm Bill that was bipartisan. It had bipartisan support. I was engaged in all of that. I was engaged for three and a half years just to get to that point,\u201d King said.\n\nKing was also a leader in a bipartisan effort to open the war memorials in D.C. for visiting veterans after President Obama had them closed due to the government shutdown.\n\nThe vicious cycle continued through the debate: King answered the moderators\u2019 questions, Mowrer attacked King, the congressman rebutted.\n\nCongressman King did manage to diminish Mowrer\u2019s credentials early on. Mowrer has consistently claimed that he established the Army office of Business Transformation and that it saved taxpayers billions of dollars. Congressman King refuted that claim.\n\n\u201cThe statement that my opponent has established the Army office of Business Transportation, I recall how it was established. I voted for that in 2008,\u201d King said. \u201cIt was signed into law in October 22, 2008. The gentleman arrived to the Pentagon in early February of 2010. So the establishment of the Army Office of Business Transformation was done by Congress.\u201d\n\nKing scored repeatedly by just stating facts, while Mowrer demagogued. The most egregious example was on the issue of Obamacare. Jim Mowrer claimed Congressman King wanted to take health insurance away from Mowrer\u2019s son, who has a rare disease.\n\nMowrer falsely stated his son would not have health insurance coverage if not for Obamacare, due to the disease being a preexisting condition.\n\nCongressman King\u2019s calm, factual rebuttal was perfect. He correctly pointed out that Mowrer\u2019s son would be covered under Hawk-I, an insurance plan for children established by the Iowa Legislature when Steve King was a state senator.\n\n\u201cBy all measures that I can uncover, Mr. Mowrer\u2019s children would be qualified for Hawk-I, so that exists, along with the high risk pool that we established. We buy down the premiums for preexisting conditions with state taxpayer dollars. I chaired the Iowa Senate State Government Committee that managed that program and that fund,\u201d King said.\n\n\u201cBut the important thing for people to remember is, Obamacare is a disaster,\u201d he added.\n\nIt was interesting that Mowrer claimed he does not support Nancy Pelosi and he\u2019s \u201cgot a lot of problems with\u201d Obamacare. Mowrer is desperately trying to appear as a moderate, and like Democrats across the nation, he is running away from his party\u2019s unpopular leadership and policies.\n\nHe even tried to tie Steve King to President Obama, a laughable notion considering Steve King is one of Obama\u2019s chief critics in Congress.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone into Never Never Land in this debate. It\u2019s completely ridiculous,\u201d King retorted.\n\nMowrer\u2019s constant attacks were the last ditch effort of a candidate who is way behind in the polls, has lost the financial support of his national party and is trying to do anything to change the direction of the race with just a week and a half left.\n\nA more distinguished tack by the Democrat perhaps could have laid the groundwork for a political future for the Boone native. Instead, he came off just another Democrat desperate to tear down one of the nation\u2019s top conservative warriors.\n\nRepublicans hold a 50,000-voter advantage in the Fourth District and Republicans are stomping Democrats in early voting there. Steve King is well on his way to another congressional term and despite Jim Mowrer\u2019s attacks, King remains beloved by voters in northwest Iowa.\n\n\u201cPeople come to me continually across this district, all 39 counties, and I\u2019ve been to all 382 towns, and they say stand your ground, keep doing what you\u2019re doing. We need more Iowa values in Washington, D.C., not less,\u201d King said.\n\nPhoto by Dave Davidson, Prezography.com", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda289\"", "article_summary": "He even tried to tie Steve King to President Obama, a laughable notion considering Steve King is one of Obama\u2019s chief critics in Congress.\nThe vicious cycle continued through the debate: King answered the moderators\u2019 questions, Mowrer attacked King, the congressman rebutted.\nCongressman King was clearly annoyed at the unyielding attacks, but did a good job maintaining his composure.\nAfter watching the only debate between Fourth District Congressman Steve King and Democrat challenger Jim Mowrer, it is easy to see why King opted out of appearing with Mowrer at other venues, and even considered cancelling this one.\nJim Mowrer claimed Congressman King wanted to take health insurance away from Mowrer\u2019s son, who has a rare disease."}
