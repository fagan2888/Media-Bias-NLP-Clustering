A national nursing shortage is hitting eastern Iowa.

According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, the nursing shortage is expected to grow as baby Boomers age and the need for health care grows. The organization says faculty shortages at nursing programs and low staffing are both factors.

Iowa hospitals are trying to be proactive. They're holding job fairs to try to get people in the door before the need for nurses grows. The Affordable Care Act could also lead to higher need for nurses as more people seek out health care.

Hospitals aren't just looking for nurses -- they're also hiring nursing assistants, technicians and therapists.

Allen Hospital in Waterloo is holding an open house and hiring fair from 3-7 p.m. Thursday, October 22. Hospitals in Cedar Rapids and Dubuque held job fairs earlier in the week.
