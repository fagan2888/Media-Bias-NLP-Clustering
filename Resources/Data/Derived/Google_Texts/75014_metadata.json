Paul LePage veto.\n\nThe House is scheduled to take up the measure Tuesday.\n\nIn the past two years, the Senate has twice passed bills that would have expanded the program under the federal Affordable Care Act. Those bids, both in 2013, fell short by one vote of the veto-proof margin of 24 votes.\n\nLePage is widely expected to continue his opposition.\n\nOffered by the Senate\u2019s assistant minority leader, Roger Katz, R-Augusta, and state Sen. Tom Saviello, R-Wilton, LD 1487 was presented as a compromise in hopes of gaining more Republican support.\n\nThe bill incorporated a managed care provision that would have largely made health care providers more responsible for reducing the costs of care by better managing populations on the program.\n\nThe bill was meant to address many of the concerns identified by Republican opponents, including LePage.\n\nAmong other things, the bill includes a sunset clause ending the expansion when federal funding dips below 100 percent, and an opt-out provision allowing the state to cancel the expansion if the feds fail to live up to their promise to pay the full cost over the next three years.\n\nThe bill adds two new Medicaid fraud investigators to the state\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe measure also aims to create savings while providing home-care services to thousands of mentally disabled Medicaid recipients who have languished on wait lists with their conditions not fully covered.\n\n\u201cExpanding access to health care will strengthen our economy and create jobs and save money, but most importantly, it will save lives,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Troy Jackson, D-Allagash, said in a prepared statement released ahead of the debate.\n\nDemocrats have largely supported the expansion, but rank-and-file conservatives who are following the lead of LePage have rebuked the idea of an expansion, saying that despite federal funding for the program, the state would eventually face hundreds of millions in additional costs.\n\nDemocrats on Wednesday unveiled a new website highlighting the cases of individuals who would benefit from an expansion.\n\nBut a better option, Republicans have argued, is to allow those eligible to purchase federally subsidized health insurance coverage on the federal insurance exchange, before expanding Maine\u2019s free-care system to between 70,000 and 100,000 new recipients.\n\nUnder the ACA, the federal government would cover 100 percent of the expansion costs for the first three years.\n\nOver time, that reimbursement rate ratchets down to 90 percent.\n\nDemocrats say refusing the expansion not only puts the health of thousands in jeopardy, it costs the state nearly $1 million a day that would create health care jobs and bolster the state\u2019s flagging economy.\n\nLePage has made a point of noting that the state, in 2013, paid off nearly $500 million in MaineCare debt owed to its hospitals, and expanding the program would become a new burden on state taxpayers. One study LePage points to shows the expansion, despite federal funding, would cost the state $800 million over the next 10 years.\n\nLePage also has said 25 percent of the state budget is already consumed by health care spending. These were themes that Republicans speaking against the bill reiterated Wednesday.\n\n\u201cImagine that for every dollar that you earn every week you had to walk over to your neighbor\u2019s house and give them 25 percent of that income,\u201d state Sen. David Burns, R-Whiting, said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what we are doing in this state.\u201d\n\nBurns said other state agencies and departments had to cut their budgets to cover the costs of MaineCare over the years.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans in favor of the bill said their colleagues were ignoring the health and financial benefits of an expansion.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think we can turn our back on the remarkable opportunity we have today to improve Maine\u2019s economy,\u201d Katz said, as he spoke in favor of the bill Wednesday. \u201cWithout expanding, we are losing out on $1 billion flowing into our state in the next three-and-a-half years. That\u2019s about a $1 million a day we are turning our backs on.\u201d\n\nSaviello warned his colleagues who spoke in opposition to the bill because they believe it would add what they call \u201cable-bodied\u201d people to the state\u2019s health care rolls, to be careful of assuming too much. \u201cKnow their story,\u201d Saviello said.\n\nHe said that while Republicans argue that many would be able to purchase low-cost insurance on the federal exchange, they may not have the means to meet co-payments or deductibles in those plans. The cost of unpaid charity care for hospitals adds to the cost of those on private insurance and costs the hospitals income and jobs, Saviello said.\n\nHe said the hospital in his district, Franklin Memorial in Farmington, would benefit from an expansion, but more importantly, the people in his district would benefit. Expansion could lead to 120 new jobs and 1,880 more people would be eligible for health care while bringing in about $9.2 million a year to his county\u2019s economy.\n\nRepublicans voting against the expansion were not swayed by those figures or by dozens of stories about individual Mainers who would benefit from the expansion, as told to them by Democrats.\n\nIt\u2019s not because they\u2019re cold and heartless, said state Sen. Mike Thibodeau, R-Winterport. It\u2019s because they fundamentally disagree on expanding what they consider a welfare program. They also disagree that the state will win out financially in the end, under an expansion.\n\n\u201cI believe in my heart that they believe that this is the right path forward for the state of Maine,\u201d Thibodeau said of his political rivals. \u201cBut many Republicans truly believe it isn\u2019t the best path forward.\u201d\n\nHe said they couldn\u2019t support expanding a \u201cwelfare system\u201d that was consuming a \u201ctremendous portion\u201d of the state budget.\n\nThe bill was scheduled to go to the House on Thursday for a floor debate, but the session was postponed to Tuesday due to heavy snow.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 After more than three hours of debate on a Republican compromise to a Democratic effort to expand Maine\u2019s low-income health care program, known as MaineCare, the compromise passed 22-13 Wednesday in the state Senate.The measure failed to garner the 24 votes it would need to be considered [...] Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "AUGUSTA, Maine \u2014 After more than three hours of debate on a Republican compromise to a Democratic effort to expand Maine\u2019s low-income health care program, known as MaineCare, the compromise passed 22-13 Wednesday in the state Senate.
