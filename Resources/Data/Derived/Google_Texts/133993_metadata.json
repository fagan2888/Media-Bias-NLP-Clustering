It isn\u2019t special treatment. All we want is to be treated just like very other married couple,\u201d said James Peters, a Kansas University employee and one of the new plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\n\nAttorney General Derek Schmidt\u2019s office said he would continue to defend the state\u2019s ban on gay marriage.\n\n\u201cThe courts will continue to sort this out, and as they do the attorney general\u2019s office will continue to defend our clients and the Kansas Constitution,\u201d Schmidt\u2019s spokeswoman, Jennifer Rapp, said in an email.\n\nPeters and his husband, Gary Mohrman, were married in Iowa in July 2010. Peters is director of the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Kansas University and receives health insurance through the State Employee Health Plan. Mohrman is self-employed and buys coverage through the federal exchange under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nPeters said he could get better and more affordable coverage for his husband through the state plan, but the state won\u2019t allow him to add his husband to the family policy because the state does not recognize marriages of same-sex couples.\n\nThe two other couples who have joined the suit include Carrie L. Fowler and Sarah C. Braun, of McLouth; and Darci Jo Bohnenblust and Colleen Hickman, of Riley.\n\nThe motion seeks temporary injunctions against Nick Jordan, Kansas secretary of revenue; Lisa Kaspar, director of the Division of Motor Vehicles; and Mike Michaels, director of the State Employee Health Plan.\n\nIn October, the ACLU filed suit on behalf of two other Kansas couples, challenging the state\u2019s refusal to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.\n\nOn Nov. 5, Judge Daniel Crabtree granted a temporary injunction against the district court clerks in Douglas and Sedgwick counties, ordering them to grant such licenses even though the case is still pending.\n\nAn appeal of that injunction is pending before the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But the U.S. Supreme Court on Nov. 12 refused to extend a stay of the injunction, and so same-sex couples in those counties have been allowed to get marriage licenses since then.\n\nSome other counties also have begun issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, including Johnson County, where the Kansas Supreme Court recently allowed gay marriages to go forward. But other counties have declined to do so, saying they will continue enforcing the current law until there is a clear decision declaring the state\u2019s ban unconstitutional.\n\nBut the state of Kansas still does not recognize the marriages that have been performed in Kansas, or those performed legally in other states that already allow same-sex marriage.\n\nLast year, the Kansas Department of Revenue issued a notice saying that same-sex couples must file separate state income tax returns, even though they are allowed to file jointly on their federal returns.\n\nIn addition, if one of the spouses in a same-sex marriage changes his or her last name, the state still requires that person to use his or her original name on a driver\u2019s license.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Lawrence Journal-World.
