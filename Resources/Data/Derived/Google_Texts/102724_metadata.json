An Aymara diplomat from Bolivia, Erwin Mamani, declared, \u201cWe were told Cuba had no Indians. So, we are very happy to meet you. Now we know it is not true.\u201d\n\nThe Guatemalan ambassador to Cuba, His Excellency Juan Leon de Alvarado, a co-sponsor of the high-level indigenous event, formally greeted the Cuban cacique. \u201cYou are now and forever part of this history. As indigenous people, we greet you; we are so very happy to finally meet the Cuban Indian leadership.\u201d The ambassador is Maya-Quich\u00e9. He formally greeted Cacique Panchito in his language.\n\nThe indigenous women leadership at the event, particularly Marta Sanchez, Amuzga people, from Mexico, and Ruth Buendia, Ash\u00e1ninka from Peru, quickly embraced Idalis Ramirez. Idalis expressed her mountain Indio culture strongly, and was resolute in the survival to the present and future-orientation of her Indian generations in Cuba. \u201cHere we are, deeply planted (plantao). Here we are going to stay.\u201d\n\nFrom the onset, when Panchito thanked the president of Casa de las Americas, signal Cuban poet, Roberto Fernandez Retamar, and welcomed the \u201cIndian people, like us, from other countries,\u201d the cacique was well ensconced as spiritual host of the event. Fernandez Retamar and the intellectual core at \u201cCasa\u201d, steeped in Cuba\u2019s half century of revolutionary tradition, gave the Cuban Indian community leaders generous respect. Centuries of denial and invisibility lifted as fog to reveal the smiling and sincere faces from La Rancheria.\n\nIn 1995, the cacique had told us: \u201cWe want to let ourselves be known.\u201d He also said: \u201cWe want to meet the other Indian people, see if they are like us.\u201d Alejandro Hartmann and I had arrived, after years of intent, at their community base of La Rancheria. Thus began a twenty-year journey, adventures of joy and sorrow, danger and reward, and always on the trail of self-discovery and self-revelation that the cacique had signaled. Some day the full story of that journey will be told. For now suffices this point of emergence, the beloved cacique at the core of hemispheric indigenous representation, and also of Cuban intellectuality, with the message and aspiration of the Taino ancestors.\n\nThe Cuban Indian emergence, as invited by the colloquium organizers, notably indigenous studies program director, Jaime Gomez Triana, was granted generous and central space. Our twenty years of orality research and documentation with the cacique and with other elders and leaders of the Cuban Indian community, was allotted a full two hours for presentation and discussion. The hall was crowded with many standing as Panchito and Idalis intoned their songs and appreciations and delivered their messages. Panchito, as always, spoke of the Madre Tierra.\n\n\u201cI plant,\u201d he said. \u201cI am campesino. I am obliged to hurt our mother, to cut her, to burn on her. How do I repay you, how do we, the human beings, repay our mother, who is so generous and who loves us so?\u201d\n\nAs Gomez Triana pointed out, indigenous peoples as the UN are directly aligning their own rights with the \u201cconstruction of alternative paradigms for the protection of the Mother Earth.\u201d\n\nPanchito and Idalis\u2019 traditional knowledge, of herbal medicines, the properties of trees and the many intricate cropping practices of the ancient Cuban Taino tubers, most notably the yucca, or manioc, is apparent. A sense of respect and audience appreciation for their particular orality is not long in surfacing. This is most important as it belies the notion espoused by some that while the Rancheria folks may have \u201csome biological inheritance,\u201d they must not have any \u201ccultural\u201d legacy that marks their own indigeneity.\n\nIn our dual presentation, Hartmann and I got the chance to review the deep history of Cuban indigeneity. From the very indigenous Taino name of Cuba, survivor of persistent Spanish intents to rename the island, to the recent genetic studies showing quite high (33 percent) Native American Mitochondrial DNA for the Cuban population, to the substantial Taino homesteading knowledge that transfers into and molds our foundational culture, the invisible thread becomes palpable. This orality mounts and deepens in reviewing the documentation on Panchito\u2019s people, whose extensive numbers, their sustaining of an office of cacique, and, in particular, their extensive repertoire of community music and dance and their central Ceremony of Macuyo, the ritual prayer of the tobacco, reveal rich cultural matria.\n\nAs the week progressed, other Cuban personalities, academics and diplomats of note, passed through the sessions of the colloquium. There was a diplomatic corps reception by the Bolivian embassy, at the plush Hotel Nacional. Cacique Panchito, modest and circumspect, was particularly sought out, including a heartfelt conversation with Bolivian Ambassador, Mr Palmiro Le\u00f3n Soria Saucedo, and with the circle of indigenous delegates.\n\nAs always in these adventures, with Panchito on travel mode, many telling episodes, spiritual teachings, great exchanges among peoples \u2013 too much for this short space. The prize was his presence, at nearly eighty years, still vibrant and to the point, representing a reality \u2013 a way of being and a way to be -- that will not die.\n\nOne day, there was an honoring for the Cuban international jurist, Miguel Alfonso Martinez. The panel included the former Cuban minister of foreign affairs, Ricardo Alarcon and other Cuban diplomats and hemispheric indigenous delegates. In the 1990s, Miguel Alfonso conducted a major study of American Indian treaties, a praiseworthy contribution, among others, to the United Nations advocacy by indigenous peoples.\n\nA young Cuban diplomat at the panel, readying for United Nations duty, commented on consistent Cuban support for the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. His clear analysis was well received. But when in passing, he mentioned that Cuban Indians had nearly disappeared, even though there are \u201csome Cuban Indian descendents,\u201d [in the eastern mountains], and that, \u201chere the genocide was overwhelming \u2026\u201d implying a finality \u2026 the awkward moment was punctured neatly by Jaime Gomez. Aqu\u00ed estan, he told the Cuban diplomat \u201cHere they are.\u201d\n\nBut Panchito and Idalis were already on their feet, with their hands up, \u201cAqui estamos,\u201d Idalis repeated.\n\nSurprised by their presence, yet after the panel, the young Cuban diplomat appeared more than pleased to meet Panchito in person. A circle formed around the two, and both men requested a photograph. Others joined. Recognition is a process; the revitalization of a whole people is an even longer process.\n\n` Later there would be a ceremony, in a cave at Mayabeque \u2013 all the Native delegates; the Cuban personnel; local healers and authorities. It is an ancient cave, inhabited by many bats, a ray of sunlight coming through the rock. All together, in a circle of consciousness, the fire delivered and Panchito called the spirits of the place, the smoke of copal and tobacco blending to signal to the sky the message of Indian survival.\n\nJose Barreiro is the assistant director for research (history and culture), Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new consciousness of Cuban reality emerged as the cacique and his daughter stepped out from a 20-year trail and into indigenous and global history.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Jose Barreiro"}}, "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/26/cacique-havana-visible-dawn-21st-century", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/author_thumbnail_medium/public/uploads/2011/08/opn-jose-barreiro-150.jpg?itok=cXft5GBV", "type": "article", "title": "The Cacique in Havana: Visible at the Dawn of the 21st Century"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/08/26/cacique-havana-visible-dawn-21st-century", "dc": {"title": "The Cacique in Havana: Visible at the Dawn of the 21st Century"}, "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.creator": "mazecyrus", "dcterms.date": "2014-08-26T08:00-04:00", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Jose Barreiro, Cuba, Roberto Fernandez Retamar, Cacique", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "The Cacique in Havana: Visible at the Dawn of the 21st Century"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9dd2\"", "article_summary": "Fernandez Retamar and the intellectual core at \u201cCasa\u201d, steeped in Cuba\u2019s half century of revolutionary tradition, gave the Cuban Indian community leaders generous respect.\nHe formally greeted Cacique Panchito in his language.\nAs indigenous people, we greet you; we are so very happy to finally meet the Cuban Indian leadership.\u201d The ambassador is Maya-Quich\u00e9.\nSurprised by their presence, yet after the panel, the young Cuban diplomat appeared more than pleased to meet Panchito in person.\nNow we know it is not true.\u201dThe Guatemalan ambassador to Cuba, His Excellency Juan Leon de Alvarado, a co-sponsor of the high-level indigenous event, formally greeted the Cuban cacique."}
