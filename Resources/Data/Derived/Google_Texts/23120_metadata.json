Employees would pay 3.33 percent of their income, in lieu of what they pay for insurance now, and employers would pay 6.67 percent of payroll, in lieu of what they currently pay now, Young said. The medical portion of workman's compensation would be covered.\n\n\"For 80 percent of people in Colorado, it will actually cost you less money,\" Young said. \"This plan will have no copays for primary and preventative care, if you are going to a specialist, there will probably be a low co-pay.\"\n\nColoradans would continue to be covered if they temporarily travel out of state and need medical care.\n\n\"This plan does not hire the doctors, it just pays the bills,\" Young said.\n\nShe said people may hear opposition from insurance and pharmaceutical companies, and even politicians, who think this is not a good idea, so people should become informed and decide for themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You are going to hear that it is going to increase our taxes by $25 billion a year,\" Young said, \"but what they don't tell you is the rest of the truth is we are not going to be paying that $31 billion that we are paying now.\"\n\nYoung said if ColoradoCare is approved by voters in November, it would save cities and counties a great deal of money in what they pay their employees for medical insurance and workman's compensation. She said it would save Ca\u00f1on City $881,000 a year and Fremont County $1.6 million annually.\n\nSome people are on board with the ballot measure, but some remain skeptical. Sharyn Baker is neither for nor against it, she just wants more concrete information. She has read the amendment and studied the issue.\n\n\"I think there are a lot of issues that remain unanswered,\" she said. \"Let's just imagine, for example, if a Republican wins the White House, this is going to be a huge mess, this whole health-care issue is going to be a huge mess.\"\n\nShe feels the amendment may be a bit premature, but she will continue to research the issue and gather as much information as she can before making up her mind.\n\nRon Scoles worked to gather signatures last year to get the amendment on the ballot.\n\n\"I had a lot of questions on it from people, but I met a lot of people who were all for it,\" he said. \"People want to see better health care than what we have right now.\"\n\nHe said his mother has been denied services, but ColoradoCare would pay for what she needs.\n\n\"It would help someone like her out a lot,\" he said.\n\nYoung said there are 350,000 people in Colorado who are uninsured, and those who are insured are either underinsured or their rates are increasing.\n\nColoradoCare will eliminate insurance company profits, reduce providers' administrative costs, provide better preventative care, reduce the high cost of the uninsured and reduce fraud. She said from 1970 to 2010, the number of physicians has not increased dramatically, but the number of administrators has.\n\nFor more information, visit www.ColoradoCare.org.
