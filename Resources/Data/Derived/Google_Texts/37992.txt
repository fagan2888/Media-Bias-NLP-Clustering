Shockingly, the “Do-Nothing Congress” may be up to something. On Friday’s The Late Show, Stephen Colbert noted that Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), along with six other Republican Congressmen, has proposed a resolution to do with magic.

H.R. 642 has the purpose of “recognizing magic as a rare and valuable art form and national treasure.” Notable magician David Copperfield even consulted.

Colbert expressed great excitement over how “that’s right, Congress may actually do something, and all it took was… magic!” As excited about the segment as Colbert was, he did note “it’s priorities like these which have made Congressional approval ratings… disappear!”

For those who worry about the real problems in America, Colbert offered how magic can help. When it comes to manufacturing jobs, “we’re about to become the world’s leading producer of silk scarves.” A deck of cards can be used to find green cards for immigrants. Those who can’t afford to live on minimum wage can expect a raise by having a quarter pulled from behind their ear. And, food stamps may become obsolete with the protein rabbits from a magician’s hat may provide.

Republicans proposing resolutions on magic is easy enough fodder for mocking Congress. But, the same silliness occurs across the aisle as well. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) spent his time on the Senate floor trying to convince his colleagues that it was the government’s job to regulate airline seat sizes. The effort was rejected.
