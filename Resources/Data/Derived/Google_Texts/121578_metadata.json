Poised and confident, and throwing a 94 mph fastball with graceful ease, the Rockies\u2019 rookie left-hander was dominant. Over his final six starts, Matzek went 4-2 with a 1.55 ERA. He looked like the Rockies\u2019 ace of the future.\n\nYet demons lurked in the corners of Matzek\u2019s mind, and by the time he took the mound for the Rockies\u2019 2015 home opener April 10, he was headed for trouble.\n\n\u201cEven when things were going the right way, there was this overwhelming stress inside me that just kept building and building and building,\u201d Matzek said recently while sipping coffee at a Starbucks in Southern California. \u201c(Then) I just couldn\u2019t hold that stress any longer and my game collapsed.\u201d\n\nMatzek was suffering from performance anxiety.\n\nIt wrecked him on the mound and even began to creep into his everyday life.\n\n\u201cMy wife, Lauren, said it was our worst time, relationship-wise, because I was so tight, so stressed, just waiting to explode from this thing,\u201d Matzek said. \u201cShe knew it wasn\u2019t about her, but it was hard.\u201d\n\nBut the quiet, intelligent 25-year-old confronted his condition head on, confident he will fulfill the promise that prompted the Rockies to make him the 11th pick in the first round of the 2009 draft. He is determined to compete for a job in the Rockies\u2019 starting rotation in spring training.\n\n\u201cI look at it like this: Sure, I had a few bad months, but in the grand scheme of things it\u2019s not that big a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is going to define me by any means.\u201d\n\nTwenty-six days after the home opener against the Cubs, it was clear Matzek was in a downward spiral. Pitching against Arizona, he walked six in two innings, throwing just 20 strikes in 58 pitches. Subsequently sent down to Triple-A Albuquerque to regroup, Matzek crash landed, giving up seven hits and seven walks while recording only three outs.\n\nWhere once he fired the ball to the plate with conviction and precision, now his mechanics were a mess and he was slinging the ball across his body and behind hitters\u2019 backs.\n\n\u201cI look back at (the home opener) and see that it wasn\u2019t a bad start, but I felt miserable afterward,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt like a failure. \u2026 It became pitch-by-pitch anxiety and then it was overall anxiety. Now it was there leading up to the games.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsed to be taboo\u201d\n\nAs defined by the National Institute of Mental Health, anxiety disorder is an umbrella term for an array of emotional ailments that annually affect about 40 million American adults \u2014 filling them with uncertainty and fearfulness.\n\nBaseball players are not immune.\n\nZack Greinke, one of the best pitchers of his generation, walked away from baseball for two months in 2006 with what was diagnosed as social anxiety disorder. He received treatment and three years later won the American League Cy Young Award with the Kansas City Royals.\n\nIn June 2009, Cincinnati Reds slugger Joey Votto revealed publicly that he was battling depression and crippling anxiety that surfaced several months after the sudden death of his 52-year-old father, Joseph. Votto suffered from panic attacks that led to two hospital stays. He rebounded in 2010 to win the National League MVP award.\n\n\u201cAnxiety and the mental side of the game used to be taboo in the big leagues; nobody wanted to talk about it,\u201d Rockies general manager Jeff Bridich said. \u201cNow we realize that it\u2019s part of the game and we address it in a more organized way.\u201d\n\nNow, every major-league club is required to have a program to assist players with behavioral health issues. The Rockies previously employed Andy McKay, who joined them in September 2012 for a position they call \u201cpeak performance coordinator.\u201d McKay left the Rockies in October to join the Seattle Mariners. The Rockies have not yet replaced him.\n\n\u201cDoubt and fear is something that virtually every ballplayer has to conquer,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cI think in our sport, in particular, there is a fear of failure, because there is so much failure in baseball. Your confidence is tested on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nNegative self-critique\n\nMatzek had suffered through bouts of wildness before. In 2011, pitching for High-A Modesto, he struggled with 46 walks in 33 innings, his ERA ballooning to 9.82. The Rockies sent him home to California, thinking it was best to remove him from competition. Matzek insists that rough patch was about bad mechanics and faltering confidence. Anxiety, he says, was not the root of his problem at that time.\n\nCuriously, the fear and negative thoughts began rearing their ugly heads after his breakout rookie season with the Rockies.\n\n\u201cFrom the day the season ended, I started putting all of this stress on myself,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI told myself I had to become one of the best pitchers, one of the top 5 percent.\u201d\n\nRather than building on his success, Matzek, who admits he over-processes things, started burying himself with a negative self-critique.\n\n\u201cAt the end of \u201914, I was thinking that my mechanics were as good as they were going to get,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought, \u2018All I need to do is get better mentally and stronger physically.\u2019 \u201c\n\nBut as spring training neared, he realized his mechanics were \u201cout of whack,\u201d he said. When he turned an ankle during spring training, that added to the problem.\n\n\u201cTrust your stuff\u201d\n\nIn her 2010 book, \u201cChoke: What the Secrets of the Brain Reveal About Getting It Right When You Have To,\u201d University of Chicago psychology professor Sian L. Beilock notes that when anxiety increases, experts can begin to think and perform like novices.\n\n\u201cToo much brain interference can make you choke,\u201d Beilock writes.\n\nFor a pitcher, losing that natural feel on the mound leads to disaster. Lefty reliever Rex Brothers, traded by the Rockies to the Cubs two weeks ago, knows all about that. After a phenomenal 2013 season when he posted a 1.74 ERA and saved 19-of-21 games, he appeared to be the Rockies\u2019 closer of the future. But he melted down in 2014 with a 5.59 ERA and spent most of the 2015 season in Triple-A.\n\n\u201cI had a couple of bad games, and then you start searching a little bit, when you probably shouldn\u2019t,\u201d Brothers said. \u201cYou need to trust the stuff that got you here and has worked for years. You go through swings where you hunt for answers, but the bottom line is you just have to trust your stuff.\u201d\n\nWeiss said there were signs during spring training that Matzek wasn\u2019t quite right \u2014 an occasional lack of fastball command \u2014 but nothing overt.\n\nBridich admits the Rockies didn\u2019t see Matzek\u2019s meltdown coming until it was too late.\n\n\u201cI wish I could say that we did, and I wish we could turn back the clock and step in, but you can\u2019t,\u201d Bridich said.\n\nAnd the fiercely competitive Matzek, trying to win a starting job, didn\u2019t reach out for help. Instead, he gritted his teeth, worked though his ankle injury and made it though spring training. Weiss tabbed him to pitch the home opener against the Cubs.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a terrible outing: four innings, four hits and one run allowed, four strikeouts and three walks. Also, he hit Cubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo twice.\n\n\u201cFrom up in the stands, I could see Tyler wasn\u2019t right,\u201d said Ryan Johnson, Matzek\u2019s half brother and close confidant. \u201cHe had no confidence in his pitches. When you are pitching at this level, you have to be at your best, and he had a C-minus game.\u201d\n\nQuite quickly, Matzek\u2019s self-induced pressure began to escalate.\n\nRemoved from competition\n\nAccording to Beilock, some people treat anxiety as a signal to perform at their best and others dwell on it as a sign of impending failure. Clearly, Matzek needed to find a way to handle his stress in a different manner.\n\nAfter his disastrous outing in Triple-A, the Rockies removed Matzek from competition and he began working in side sessions with Mark Wiley, the Rockies\u2019 director of pitching operations, pitching coordinator Doug Linton and McKay. Matzek also found his own sports anxiety specialist, and beginning in July, he began seeing him on a regular basis.\n\n\u201cHe helped me with a program that has given me the tools that have helped me numb the anxiety,\u201d said Matzek, who declined to reveal the name of the sports psychologist. \u201cI can now take a situation that was a 10 and take it down to a two or three.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kristi Pikiewicz, a Boulder-based psychotherapist, anxiety sufferers need a game plan.\n\n\u201cThe key to overcoming anxiety is having tools and techniques and knowing what the triggers are,\u201d Pikiewicz said. \u201cYou have to be able to see yourself and find that sense of calm. It takes a lot of self-awareness.\u201d\n\nIt also requires perspective.\n\n\u201cMy specialist made me realize it wasn\u2019t the end of the world, it wasn\u2019t the end of my career,\u201d said Matzek, who does not take medication to help alleviate his anxiety. \u201cHe said, \u2018You are going through a rough three or four months. It happens to everybody in sports; yours is just a little rougher than somebody else. You still have 10 or 15 years left to play baseball. You\u2019re only 25, so calm down, let\u2019s fix this, let\u2019s figure it out.\u201d\n\nWalt Weiss aware \u201cit\u2019s a battle\u201d\n\nFinding a lasting fix, however, is not easy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen this before, and I know it\u2019s a battle, so I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat it,\u201d said Weiss, who, during his playing days, saw pitchers Bruce Ruffin and Mark Wohlers battle wildness that was sparked by anxiety.\n\nMatzek\u2019s comeback started with a stutter. In three games last summer with the Single-A, short-season Boise Hawks, Matzek posted a 23.14 ERA and walked eight over 2 innings. But at the end of the season, he pitched out of the bullpen in 10 games for Albuquerque. On Sept. 3 he pitched two scoreless innings, struck out three, didn\u2019t walk a batter and earned a save.\n\n\u201cI saw him come back, physically and mentally,\u201d Albuquerque pitching coach Darryl Scott said. \u201cThere is no doubt in my mind that he can come back and be the pitcher he was, or even better.\u201d\n\nMatzek admits that he\u2019s surprised, and grateful, that the Rockies have held on to him through his roller-coaster ride of a career.\n\nWhy did the Rockies stick with him?\n\n\u201cThe first reason is an easy one. Everybody sees the talent he has,\u201d Bridich said. \u201cThe second answer is that I am one of many people in this organization who believe in this guy. We have seen him grow from a teenager into a solid young man. Together we are going to work to make sure that all of this is just one chapter of a very long career.\u201d\n\nMatzek insists he\u2019s eager, not anxious, to take the mound again when the Rockies report to spring training in mid-February.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it will be the whole, freak-out, paralyzing thing on the rubber again,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I pitched (in Albuquerque) at the end of the season, I just said, \u2018Let\u2019s do this. Let me face as many batters as possible. Righties, lefties, I don\u2019t care.\u2019\n\n\u201cI just wanted to put my tools into practice. Two weeks in the bullpen wasn\u2019t enough time to fix everything physically, but mentally I was all there.\n\n\u201cSo now it\u2019s time to fix the physical stuff, use the mental skills I have learned and go pitch well next year.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or @psaundersdp\n\nMatzek\u2019s journey\n\nTyler Matzek\u2019s career in professional baseball has been a roller-coaster ride of success and failure since the left-hander received a then-club record $3.9 million signing bonus from the Rockies in 2009 as the 11th pick of the MLB draft:\n\n2010: The 19-year-old rookie shines at Single-A Asheville with 5-1 record and 2.92 ERA in 18 starts.\n\n2011: Struggles at Asheville (4.36 ERA), incurs bouts of wildness at High-A Modesto (9.82 ERA), and is shut down for the rest of the season.\n\n2012: Returns for a full season at Modesto, striking out 153 in 142 innings but walking 95.\n\n2013: Pitching for Double-A Tulsa, goes 8-9 with 3.79 ERA and reduces his walks to 76 in 142 innings.\n\n2014: After a strong performance in Triple-A, makes his big-league debut with the Rockies on June 11 against Atlanta.
