I\u2019ve argued as much in numerous blog posts, congressional testimony and in a chapter on what I call the \u201cAd Hoc Implementation of Obamacare\u201d in a new book, \u201cLiberty\u2019s Nemesis: The Unchecked Expansion of the State.\u201d David Bernstein also makes this case in his book, \u201cLawless,\u201d as have others such as Iowa law professor Andy Grewal.\n\nCriticism of the Obama administration\u2019s implementation of Obamacare from the administration\u2019s critics is not particularly surprising. Although some of us may have criticized equivalent Bush administration lawlessness, there\u2019s not much newsworthy about an administration taking fire from across the aisle.\n\nIt is more notable when a prominent defender of the Obama administration acknowledges that the administration has colored outside the lines, and not always with good justification. So those interested in the Affordable Care Act and the administrative law should give Nicholas Bagley\u2019s new paper on \u201cLegal Limits and the Implementation of the Affordable Care Act\u201d a careful read. The paper\u2019s still in draft form \u2014 and in my view bends over backward to provide the most charitable read of the administration\u2019s actions \u2014 but still concludes that the administration has violated the law repeatedly in implementing the ACA, even if not quite as often as some administration critics have claimed.\n\nBagley writes:\n\nTaken as a whole, then, the record refutes the claim that President Obama has systematically disregarded the ACA\u2019s text or displayed contempt for legal constraints. He hasn\u2019t. To the contrary, the law still has bite. On occasion, however, the administration has strayed beyond legal limits. Two episodes raise especially serious legal concerns: the administrative delays and the decision to finance cost-sharing reductions out of an appropriation governing tax refunds. In both cases, Republican recalcitrance threatened to undermine the president\u2019s signal achievement. And in both cases, the president appears to have broken the law.\n\nNote that by \u201cadministrative delays\u201d Bagley is actually referring to multiple decisions made over many months, including the multiple delays of the employer mandate and the so-called \u201cif you like it you can keep it\u201d fix. Characterizing all of these delays as a single episode \u2014 one of the eight he examines \u2014 seems to stack the deck a little bit. Nonetheless, Bagley\u2019s candor about the paltry legal justification for these actions is refreshing, even if he insists on stressing that there are still lots of legal rules the administration hasn\u2019t violated. (As Mike Stern quipped, \u201cThink of all the buildings Nixon didn\u2019t break into.\u201d)\n\nWhere Bagley finds admirable restraint, I suspect calculation. It seems to me the administration has strayed from the ACA\u2019s text law when and where it thinks it\u2019s difficult for critics to obtain judicial review, though other explanations are possible, too. In any event, the paper helps further a discussion about the appropriateness of what some consider administrative \u201cself-help.\u201d This is not the first administration to take liberties with a statute when Congress refused to cooperate (see, e.g., what the Bush administration did with the Clean Air Act), and it won\u2019t be the last.\n\nA real question is whether the Obama administration\u2019s actions with regard to the ACA are an augur of what is to come in the future. I hope not, but there are reasons for concern. As Bagley notes in the paper, it is increasingly rare for legal commentators to flag the legal violations of those on their own \u201cside,\u201d and that\u2019s a problem.\n\nNowadays, the president can often count on support (or at least silence) from like-minded attorneys, legal academics, and other expert commentators. During the ACA\u2019s rollout, for example, almost no Democratic lawyers spoke out against the Obama administration\u2019s controversial legal moves, just as almost no Republican lawyers spoke in defense of them. Law, I fear, is increasingly seen as simply another move in a partisan game\u2014a raw extension of politics with less persuasive force of its own. If that\u2019s the view of law that has enabled Congress to disregard legal conventions, why won\u2019t that same view lead to presidential disregard of similar self-help conventions? At the end of the day, the story of the ACA\u2019s implementation leaves me equally encouraged and unsettled. Law still matters; it\u2019s not politics all the way down. At the same time, the Obama administration\u2019s legal violations don\u2019t appear to be idiosyncratic expressions of a particular president\u2019s governing style, but more-or-less inevitable reactions to polarization and the breakdown of governing conventions. While I\u2019m skeptical that self-help conventions will reliably discipline such lawbreaking, I\u2019ve got no better answers about how to restrain the president. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard for me to shake the fear that we are entering an era marked by the relentless chipping away at the rule of law. I don\u2019t want to seem alarmist: for now, such chipping away is modest. But it appears poised to become a durable feature of American governance, with consequences I can\u2019t begin to anticipate. In contrast to some,162 I can\u2019t view that trend with equanimity. It seems to me that the rule of law is a terrible thing to waste.\n\nOn that last point, we certainly agree.
