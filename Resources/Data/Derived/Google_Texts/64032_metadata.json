The New York Times\n\nThe notorious Guanabara Bay won\u2019t be clean in time for the 2016 Olympic sailing and windsurfing competitions, Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes admitted.\n\nWhen the city won hosting rights in 2009, Paes promised the bay would be cleaned up. \u201cI am sorry that we didn\u2019t use the games to get Guanabara Bay completely clean, but that wasn\u2019t for the Olympic Games \u2014 that was for us,\u201d Paes said on June 7. \u201cThat was something that we could not accomplish that was in the bid book.\u201d\n\nThe bay has been reported to be extremely vile. \u201cVast amounts of raw sewage leak into the waters. Officials set a goal of treating as much as 80 percent of it by the 2016 Olympics, but less than 40 percent is currently treated,\u201d The New York Times reported on May 18. Trash and dog carcasses are among the many reported sightings in the polluted bay. The bay has been described as \u201cdark, brown, and stinking\u201d by Lars Grael, a Brazilian sailing legend who won two Olympic medals.\n\nDespite the sightings of human corpses in the water, Paes stated Guanabara\u2019s waters don\u2019t pose a health risk. The sailing competition will either be moved to a new location or take place a less polluted part of the bay. John Coates, an International Olympic Committee vice president, said Rio\u2019s Olympic preparations are the \u201cworst ever.\u201d Brazil is also facing scrutiny over the World Cup opener on June 12 because almost all of the 12 new or refurbished soccer stadiums have been delayed or over budget.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "2016 olympics, rio bay, pollution", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Despite the Mayor of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s 2009 Promise, the Rio Bay won\u2019t be clean in time for the Olympic sailing and windsurfing competitions.", "title": "Rio Bay Will Still Be Polluted During 2016 Olympics, Mayor Says", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rio-de-janeiro-mayor-breaks-his-2009-promise-rio-bay-wont-be-clean-2016-olympics-he-says-287420", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/10/guanabara-bay-polluted.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Despite the Mayor of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s 2009 Promise, the Rio Bay won\u2019t be clean in time for the Olympic sailing and windsurfing competitions.", "title": "Rio Bay Will Still Be Polluted During 2016 Olympics, Mayor Says", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/rio-de-janeiro-mayor-breaks-his-2009-promise-rio-bay-wont-be-clean-2016-olympics-he-says-287420", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/10/guanabara-bay-polluted.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/10/guanabara-bay-polluted.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-10T11:11:31-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-10T11:11:29-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Despite the Mayor of Rio de Janeiro\u2019s 2009 Promise, the Rio Bay won\u2019t be clean in time for the Olympic sailing and windsurfing competitions."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3a5\"", "article_summary": "Popular tourist destination and the second largest bay in Brazil, Rio Bay, has drawn criticism and health concerns among Olympic sailors and the International Olympic Committee.\nThe New York TimesThe notorious Guanabara Bay won\u2019t be clean in time for the 2016 Olympic sailing and windsurfing competitions, Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes admitted.\nThe sailing competition will either be moved to a new location or take place a less polluted part of the bay.\n\u201cThat was something that we could not accomplish that was in the bid book.\u201dThe bay has been reported to be extremely vile.\nWhen the city won hosting rights in 2009, Paes promised the bay would be cleaned up."}
