Murphy hints Giffords shooting tied to ACA vote\n\nFormer Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy suggested in an op-ed that Gabby Giffords was shot because of her vote for Obamacare \u2014 an assertion at odds with the story of gunman Jared Loughner, whose deadly rampage in January 2011 in Tucson, Ariz., was never found to have been motivated by a partisan political agenda.\n\nIn the piece on MSNBC.com, the ex-Pennsylvania lawmaker, who lost his seat in 2010, said he had received death threats and noted that Giffords had been shot \u201conly months after she voted for the health care law.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cI was one of those members yelled at in town halls and who received death threats and watched on TV when my colleague was shot in the head in January 2011, only months after she voted for the health care law,\u201d Murphy wrote.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Police photos from Giffords shooting)\n\n\u201cBut then I think about why I cast the vote in the first place. I know I\u2019m one of the lucky ones. I came back home from war in one piece,\u201d he added.\n\nAsked to comment on the op-ed, the former lawmaker said he stood by what he wrote and went further to accuse Republicans of \u201cintentionally\u201d stoking fear.\n\n\u201cI stand by the piece that I wrote. I think that there were prominent Republicans who intentionally stoked fear. I thought that their comments were reckless and the violence that many experienced, were the consequences,\u201d Murphy said to POLITICO.\n\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)\n\nMurphy said he includes death threats and bricks thrown through windows as the \u201cviolence\u201d he mentioned.\n\n\u201cAnd I hope in retrospect, the bricks through the windows, death threats, et cetera. I just hope that those prominent Republicans can live, now three years later, with the consequences of their remarks. My conscious is clear, I\u2019m glad I did it,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nMurphy, who continued his support for Obamacare, also criticized the \u201cdesperate lies and scare tactics\u201d by the health care law\u2019s critics.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: What the Obamacare fight is really about)\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the same desperate lies and scare tactics will continue, but the facts surrounding Obamacare are finally coming into focus,\u201d Murphy wrote. \u201cI\u2019m damn proud I stood up and voted for Obamacare. It was the right thing to do, even if it did cost my reelection.\u201d\n\nRNC spokesperson Kirsten Kukowski responded by saying Murphy was focusing on the wrong issue.\n\n\u201cInstead of focusing on mental health issues that played a role in this tragedy, it\u2019s sad Democrats like Patrick Murphy are trying to use it to score political points.\u201d\n\nGiffords could not immediately be reached for comment.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He notes that Giffords had been shot \u201conly months after she voted for the health care law.\u201d", "title": "Murphy hints Giffords shooting tied to ACA vote", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2013/10/patrick-murphy-gabby-giffords-97725.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2013/10/02/131002_patrick_murphy_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Patrick Murphy,Tucson Shootings (48),Gabrielle Giffords", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He notes that Giffords had been shot \u201conly months after she voted for the health care law.\u201d", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9f77\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAnd I hope in retrospect, the bricks through the windows, death threats, et cetera.\n( PHOTOS: 25 unforgettable Obamacare quotes)Murphy said he includes death threats and bricks thrown through windows as the \u201cviolence\u201d he mentioned.\nThe ex-Pennsylvania lawmaker said he had received death threats.\n( Also on POLITICO: Police photos from Giffords shooting)\u201cBut then I think about why I cast the vote in the first place.\nMurphy hints Giffords shooting tied to ACA voteFormer Democratic Rep.
