Watson, a PGA professional from Myrtle Beach who held a two-shot lead after an opening round 71, closed with a 76 to finish at 147. Thompson, a pro at Carolina Lakes Golf Club near Charlotte finished bogey-bogey to post a closing 74 for his share of second.\n\nStuart Clark finished solo fourth, thanks to a final-round best 71 on Sunday. Brandon Hartzell rounded out the top five with a 73 that gave him a 149 total, five over par.\n\nKostyal, playing in his first North Charleston Open, had never seen the Mike Hurdzan-designed Wescott Golf Club until a practice round late Friday afternoon, but \u201cI really liked the golf course right away,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the nicest public courses I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d the personable blond added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s one of the toughest courses I\u2019ve played, as the scores this weekend showed. It\u2019s a great driving course, one that really puts a lot of demands on you off the tee.\u201d\n\nKostyal got off to a quick start Sunday with birdies at the short par-4 third and the par-5 fourth holes on the Burn Kill nine at Wescott, thanks to a pair of putts in the 30-foot range, the latter from just in the fringe. But he quickly gave back both shots when he bogeyed the par-4 fifth and par-3 sixth holes.\n\nAnother 30-footer from the fringe at the par-3 13th \u2013 the fourth hole on the Black Robin nine \u2013 got the eventual champ back into red figures. At 17, only a \u201cgreat\u201d flop shot from well right of the green and a perfect five-foot putt allowed Kostyal to remain one under for the day and one over for the tournament. And when Thompson bogeyed the par-3 and Watson managed only a par, Kostyal went to the final hole with a one-shot lead over Thompson, two clear of Watson.\n\nThat lead looked in jeopardy when, going for the closing par-5 in two, he blocked his second shot into a hazard right. Taking a drop, his fourth shot came up 20 yards short and right of the green. From there, he pulled off another miraculous flop shot \u2013 this one to a foot \u2013 to save bogey, and when Thompson also bogeyed and Watson settled for par, Kostyal had the biggest title of his amateur career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve only played so-so this summer. Coming into this week, my best finish was 17th in the North Carolina Amateur,\u201d he said. \u201cSo to win my first time playing against the pros, this was really big for me.\u201d\n\nThe North Charleston Open, sponsored by Classic Golf Management, which operates Wescott Golf Club for the City of North Charleston, drew 87 players in four divisions \u2013 the Open or Championship division, as well as men\u2019s, senior and ladies\u2019 divisions.\n\nNorth Charleston Open\n\nWescott Golf Club\n\nNorth Charleston, S.C.\n\nSept. 12-13, 2015\n\nFINAL RESULTS\n\nOPEN DIVISION\n\n(Burn Kill-Black Robin nines)\n\na-David Kostyal II......................................... 74-72\u2014146\n\nDerek Watson................................................ 71-76\u2014147\n\nJohn Thompson.............................................. 73-74\u2014147\n\nStuart Clark.................................................... 77-71\u2014148\n\nBrandon Hartzell........................................... 76-73\u2014149\n\nBilly Joe Hill, Jr............................................. 80-72\u2014152\n\na-Mike Cobb.................................................. 78-76\u2014154\n\na-Tadd Brown................................................ 76-79\u2014155\n\nDavid Lott, Jr................................................ 76-79\u2014155\n\nL loyd Taylor III............................................ 79-77\u2014156\n\nKevan Maxwell.............................................. 80-77\u2014157\n\na-Cass Sigmon............................................... 77-81\u2014158\n\nReed Johnson................................................. 79-80\u2014159\n\nT.A.
