And Jones Day partner Michael Carvin, the lawyer for the losing plaintiffs, would glumly file back into a hushed locker room.\n\nThursday\u2019s Obamacare ruling marked the second time in three years that a centerpiece of the health law came under heavy legal assault and survived. In both cases, Mr. Verrilli was the lawyer standing before the high court in its defense.\n\nAnd once again, Mr. Verrilli prevailed, when Chief Justice Roberts united with the court\u2019s liberal wing in refusing to dismantle the health law.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to SG Don Verrilli,\u201d tweeted former Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nWriting for Slate, former acting Solicitor General Walter Dellinger says he\u2019s \u201crarely seen an opinion of the court that more closely followed the government\u2019s arguments.\u201d\n\nRon Pollack, head of the Families USA health law advocacy group, said he saw the solicitor general in the courtroom today but that Mr. Verrilli had told him he thought the health decision would come Friday. When it became clear that Chief Justice Roberts was reading an opinion upholding the tax credits, Mr. Pollack said he wanted to jump up and down and hug Mr. Verrilli, but was bound by the court\u2019s rules for decorum and silence.\n\nFor Mr. Carvin, the ruling marked the second time he argued against the health law but failed to persuade at least five justices. In 2012 he represented the challengers to the law who fell one vote short when Chief Justice Roberts voted to uphold Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual mandate as a tax.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m obviously disappointed,\u201d Mr. Carvin told Law Blog on Thursday after the court announced its decision. \u201cI think the big loser today was the rule of law.\u201d\n\nJust before arguments in the case in March, the star conservative litigator likened himself to the hero of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird.\u201d Fighting for the rule of law is \u201cwhat Atticus Finch was doing,\u201d he told The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\u201cThis is probably the easiest case I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Mr. Carvin said at the time. \u201cI believe to my bones that if this involved some mortgage deduction or any kind of tax question outside the politically charged context of this case, no judge would disagree.\u201d\n\nMr. Carvin attributed his last defeat to legal precedents that granted broad deference to Congress and to the challenge of trying to prove how the framers would have approached the legality of Obamacare\u2019s overhaul of the modern health-care marketplace.\n\nDon\u2019t give Mr. Verrilli too much credit, says South Texas College of Law professor Josh Blackman, who wrote a book about the 2012 constitutional challenge to Obamacare. The court rejected the government\u2019s position that \u201cestablished by the state\u201d was, in Mr. Verrilli\u2019s words, a \u201cterm of art\u201d deliberately chosen by Congress.\n\nMr. Blackman also noted that the majority dismissed the argument advanced by the solicitor general that the court should defer to the Internal Revenue Service, which wrote the regulation authorizing subsidies for insurance purchased on federally run exchanges.\n\n\u201cOn the whole the government won, but not based on the [solicitor general's] arguments,\u201d the professor said.\n\n\u2013 Louise Radnofsky contributed to this post.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "If blockbusters Supreme Court battles ended the way sports championships do, U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli would be soaked in champagne and showered with Gatorade.
