This week on Valley Edition we focus on possible solutions to homelessness in Fresno, how the Affordable Care Act will impact agricultural growers and one man’s journey into the lives of a group of indigenous migrant workers.

Valley Edition host Joe Moore speaks with a panel of homeless advocates about possible housing solutions to Fresno’s rising homeless population. He is joined by Beverly Fitzpatrick with the Thursday Group; Bill Simon with John Steinbock’s Homeless Advocacy Committee, renowned architect Arthur Dyson and Scott Layman the building coordinator for Dignity Village in Portland.

Ending the program, Seth Holmes, Assistant Professor of Medical Anthropology and Public Health at the University of California Berkeley, speaks with Moore about his latest book, "Fresh Fruit, Broken Bodies: Migrant Farm workers in the United States." Holmes shares his experience working in the fields of the San Joaquin Valley with indigenous migrant workers from Mexico.
