TIGTA plans on running a full audit on whether IRS procedures for processing PTC claims were correct later this year.\n\nSocial media self-help, TAC rates drop\n\nThe IRS saw a spike in page views for its social media outlets such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube for self-help assistance with filing taxes, and about 87 percent of taxpayers filed electronically through online outlets such as the IRS website and the IRS2Go mobile app.\n\nDespite its gains on digital outlets, the IRS struggled to help taxpayers on traditional ones, sinking to a 37.6 percent success rate on its customer assistance phone line with a 23 1/2 minute average wait time.\n\nThat\u2019s more than a 33 percent drop for customer service levels and a 12 minute spike in wait time from 2014.\n\nWalk-ins at the IRS\u2019 face to face help centers dropped to 5.3 million, a decrease of 200,000 from 2014. TIGTA attributed the drop to the IRS\u2019 efforts to divert services to other outlets such as its website to offset staffing shortages.\n\nStrengthening the IRS\n\nThe IRS had issues processing certain tax credits.\n\nTIGTA found the IRS mishandled tax returns for educator expense deduction claims, incorrectly denying qualifying taxpayers $53,988 in refunds, and denied more than $1.5 million in residential energy credit claims when employees mistakenly limited refunds.\n\nThe audit also noted that efforts should be strengthened to stop fraudulent tax returns from being filed. While controls that identify fraud stopped $787 million in false claims from going through the wrong filers, the IG found there are no directives in place to stop multiple deposits from being made into the same account.\n\nTIGTA recommended the IRS combat tax fraud by putting additional systems in place so that no more than three tax return direct deposits can be submitted to a single account.\n\nThe IRS agreed with all of TIGTA\u2019s recommendations and has already sent out corrected returns for the educator expense deductions\n\nOrganizations have long warned ongoing budget cuts to the IRS would eventually lead to major problems in customer service.\n\nA Report to Congress from the National Taxpayer Advocate noted the Hill has cut the IRS\u2019 budget by about $1.2 billion since 2010. The House Appropriations Committee approved a budget of $10.1 billion for 2016, about $838 million less than current funding.\n\nThe budget pinch has forced the agency to freeze hiring despite attrition.\n\n\u201cThe decision by Congress to slash funding for the IRS by a total of $1.2 billion in the past five years has been disastrous for taxpayers and the economy,\u201d said Tony Reardon, national president of the National Treasury Employees Union. \u201cDespite widespread recognition that IRS needs increased funding, Congress is proposing steeper cuts for next year. Additional cuts would be devastating.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/plugins/sailthru-custom/assets/img/wtop50x50.jpg", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, irs, premium tax credit, sam ufret, tigta", "application-name": "FederalNewsRadio.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-22 02:17:57", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "og": {"site_name": "FederalNewsRadio.com", "description": "With a wave of new legislation and a shortage of resources, an IRS audit found that despite some hiccups, the IRS did well for the 2015 tax season.", "title": "Audit of IRS finds 2015 a decent year for embattled agency", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2015-09-23T11:49:22+00:00", "url": "http://federalnewsradio.com/agency-oversight/2015/09/2015-tax-season-mixed-bag-progress-setback-tigta-says/", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "sailthru.canonical": "http://federalnewsradio.com/agency-oversight/2015/09/2015-tax-season-mixed-bag-progress-setback-tigta-says/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "Agency Oversight", "tag": "Affordable Care Act,IRS,Premium Tax Credit,Sam Ufret,TIGTA", "published_time": "2015-09-22T14:17:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-23T11:49:22+00:00"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/themes/wfed/assets/img/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "sailthru.image.full": "http://federalnewsradio.com/wp-content/plugins/sailthru-custom/assets/img/wtop50x50.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "With a wave of new legislation and a shortage of resources, an IRS audit found that despite some hiccups, the IRS did well for the 2015 tax season."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca675\"", "article_summary": "The IRS received more than 137 million tax returns in 2015, up by 1.1 million from 2014.\nAdvertisementTIGTA runs a tax season audit every year, but the Treasury Department took care to monitor 2015 closely since it\u2019s the first tax season with legislative impact from the Affordable Care Act, the Premium Tax Credit (PTC), and other bills.\nTIGTA determined the IRS processed tax returns accurately and in a timely manner, and implemented tax legislation for the 2015 filing season correctly.\nThe audit also noted that efforts should be strengthened to stop fraudulent tax returns from being filed.\nA Report to Congress from the National Taxpayer Advocate noted the Hill has cut the IRS\u2019 budget by about $1.2 billion since 2010."}
