REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\n4884956\n\nIn a 242-186, vote the House fell short of the two-thirds needed to pass a measure Tuesday overriding the president\u2019s veto of a bill designed to dismantle Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood for a year.\n\nAhead of the vote, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said regardless of the outcome, the party will continue its fight against the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe have now forged a path \u2014 that is a clear path\u2014 to repealing Obamacare without 60 votes in the Senate. So what we are proving today is if we have a Republican president next year, we will repeal Obamacare. And we will replace Obamacare,\u201d he said at his morning press conference.\n\nRepublicans have been highly critical of the Affordable Care Act since it has raised premiums for most Americans, increased costs for small businesses and caused many to lose access their doctors since its implementation.\n\nSince its passage, the GOP controlled Congress has attempted to dismantle the bill 62 times, successfully sending a bill to the president\u2019s desk just once.\n\n\u201cFrankly, this health care law has hurt too many Americans,\u201d House Committee on Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady said on the House floor Tuesday. \u201cWe know now the path to repeal. We know how to remove the law\u2019s mandates, tax hikes and slush funds.\u201d\n\nCongress passed the Restoring Americans\u2019 Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act in early January, using a budgetary tool called reconciliation, which requires just a majority vote in the Senate and allows for an unlimited number of amendments. The legislation would have eliminated the individual and employer mandates and killed the Cadillac tax and medical device tax \u2014 which were recently delayed for two years under a provision in the omnibus spending bill.\n\nFollow Juliegrace Brufke on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
