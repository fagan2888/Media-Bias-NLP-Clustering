What should the legacy of King Abdullah be, both at home and in the U.S.?\n\nPhillips: Although the late king was far from liberal from an American perspective, he was considered to be a liberal in the Saudi context.\n\nHis incremental reforms of the educational system, expansion of the fields that women were allowed to work in, approval of voting rights for women in Saudi Arabia\u2019s limited local elections and approval of women running for office were major changes.\n\nSaudi women still are prohibited from driving but that is much more likely [to happen] after the reforms put in place by Abdullah.\n\nFor the United States, Abdullah was a reliable ally for containing Iran, Saudi Arabia\u2019s archrival, and pushing Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait in 1991, when he was the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia as crown prince under an ailing King Fahd.\n\nHe also has been an ally in battling ISIS, which poses a bigger threat to Saudi Arabia than it does to the U.S.\n\nDespite major differences with the U.S. on Arab-Israeli issues, Abdullah did support a diplomatic solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a softening of Saudi Arabia\u2019s traditional hardline opposition to Israel\u2019s existence.\n\nQ: What does King Abdullah\u2019s death mean for Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production strategy, and for worldwide supply of oil?\n\nA: In the short run, the king\u2019s death probably will not result in major changes to Saudi oil policy.\n\nAs the world\u2019s biggest oil producer and steward of roughly 15 percent of the world\u2019s oil reserves, Saudi Arabia favors lower oil prices than most OPEC countries because it has a long oil production horizon and wants to discourage the development of alternative supplies such as U.S. shale oil.\n\nNew Saudi leader King Salman has indicated that he will maintain Saudi oil production policies put in place by Abdullah and will retain the same oil minister.\n\nThis is good news for the global economy and oil-importing states everywhere.\n\nQ: What should we know about the new king, Salman?\n\nA: Salman probably won\u2019t rule very long. He is 79 and reportedly has experienced mounting health problems.\n\nHe probably will continue many of the policies of his predecessor, but is unlikely to support incremental reforms to the same extent.\n\nQ: What challenges does Salman face?\n\nSalman faces rising external threats to his kingdom, including Iran, al-Qaeda\u2019s franchise in neighboring Yemen and ISIS, which has attracted support from many young Saudis.\n\nYesterday\u2019s ouster of Yemeni President Hadi, a Saudi ally, by Iran-backed Houthi rebels is a sign of growing potential threats from the south.\n\nIran also is active in backing Shiite militants in Bahrain and inside Saudi Arabia\u2019s Eastern Province, the kingdom\u2019s major oil-producing region.\n\nHe also must provide for the needs of Saudi Arabia\u2019s rapidly growing population, particularly jobs for young Saudis, who have a high unemployment rate and may be susceptible to the siren call of Islamist extremism.\n\nQ: Why is Saudi Arabia an important ally against terrorism? What is it doing to help defeat ISIS?\n\nA: Although Saudis initially were in denial about the threat posed by al-Qaeda, which attracted many young Saudis, they were prompted by terrorist attacks inside the kingdom in 2003 to take a harder line against Islamist extremism.\n\nSaudi religious leaders have denounced al-Qaeda and ISIS, an offshoot that broke away from al-Qaeda\u2019s top leaders.\n\nThe Saudi Air Force has launched air strikes against ISIS and the Saudis are working behind the scenes to turn Arab tribes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In an interview with The Daily Signal, James Phillips, an expert on the Middle East for The Heritage Foundation, reflects on Abdullah\u2019s legacy and charts Saudi Arabia\u2019s future.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In an interview with The Daily Signal, James Phillips, an expert on the Middle East for The Heritage Foundation, reflects on Abdullah\u2019s legacy and charts Saudi Arabia\u2019s future.", "title": "What Does Death of Saudi Arabian King Mean for the US?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/sfphotos466723.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1uq1bWv"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "In an interview with The Daily Signal, James Phillips, an expert on the Middle East for The Heritage Foundation, reflects on Abdullah\u2019s legacy and charts Saudi Arabia\u2019s future.", "title": "What Does Death of Saudi Arabian King Mean for the US?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/sfphotos466723.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "International,middle east", "published_time": "2015-01-23T17:51:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "King Abdullah, ISIS, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Middle East, Arab, OPEC, oil, King Salman, terrorism, al-Qaeda, Yemen"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3969\"", "article_summary": "Q: What does King Abdullah\u2019s death mean for Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil production strategy, and for worldwide supply of oil?\nWhen King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia died on Friday, the loss could be felt in the United States.\nA: In the short run, the king\u2019s death probably will not result in major changes to Saudi oil policy.\nNew Saudi leader King Salman has indicated that he will maintain Saudi oil production policies put in place by Abdullah and will retain the same oil minister.\nIran also is active in backing Shiite militants in Bahrain and inside Saudi Arabia\u2019s Eastern Province, the kingdom\u2019s major oil-producing region."}
