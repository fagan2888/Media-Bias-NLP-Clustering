And so, I will listen to the opinion of the people and do as they choose,\u201d Berdymukhamedov said in 2014, responding to the statue proposal.\n\nThe authoritarian former Soviet nation has no independent public movements, however, making the notion that the statue was a grassroots effort improbable.\n\nBerdymukhamedov, nicknamed Arkadag (the Protector), won the presidential election in 2012 with a landslide 97 percent in a vote criticized by election monitors.\n\nState media has assiduously cultivated an image of Berdymukhamedov, a 57-year-old dentist, as a dynamo beloved by the people. Depicting him as active and sports-obsessed is designed to distinguish him from the late Niyazov, a corpulent bon viveur who died of heart failure.\n\nIn April, parliament approved a government decree bestowing Berdymukhamedov with the official title of \u201cnational horse-breeder of Turkmenistan.\u201d\n\nHorses, particularly the native Akhal-Teke breed, are an integral component of Turkmen folk culture.\n\nUntil now, adulation for the president has been channeled primarily through monuments dedicated to his father, Myalikguli Berdymukhamedov.\n\nIn a practice echoing Niyazov\u2019s habit of naming streets and organizations after his parents, a police unit was named after Berdymukhamedov senior in 2012. Two bronze busts have also been erected in honor of the president\u2019s father.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Turkmenistan has unveiled a grandiose gold-leafed statue of the president carrying a dove and riding atop a horse -- a move aimed at burnishing the leader's burgeoning personality cult.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Turkmenistan has unveiled a grandiose gold-leafed statue of the president carrying a dove and riding atop a horse \u2014 a move aimed at burnishing the leader\u2019s burgeoning personality cult.", "title": "Turkmenistan unveils massive gold-leaf statue of president", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/25/turkmenistan-unveils-massive-gold-leaf-statue-pres/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/25/Turkmenistan_President_Statue.JPEG-0831b.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/05/25/Turkmenistan_President_Statue.JPEG-0831b.jpg", "description": "Turkmenistan has unveiled a grandiose gold-leafed statue of the president carrying a dove and riding atop a horse -- a move aimed at burnishing the leader's burgeoning personality cult.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Turkmenistan unveils massive gold-leaf statue of president"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, Saparmurat Niyazov, Turkmenistan"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1d2f\"", "article_summary": "ASHGABAT, Turkmenistan (AP) \u2014 Turkmenistan has unveiled a grandiose gold-leafed statue of the president carrying a dove and riding atop a horse \u2014 a move aimed at burnishing the leader\u2019s burgeoning personality cult.\nThe 21-meter (69-foot) monument presented to the public Monday in the energy-rich but isolated Central Asian nation includes a statue of President Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov mounted on a towering pile of marble.\nTurkmenistan is dotted with gold-leaf statues to Berdymukhamedov\u2019s eccentric predecessor, Saparmurat Niyazov, who died in 2006, but this is the first such monument to the current leader.\nUntil now, adulation for the president has been channeled primarily through monuments dedicated to his father, Myalikguli Berdymukhamedov.\nThe authoritarian former Soviet nation has no independent public movements, however, making the notion that the statue was a grassroots effort improbable."}
