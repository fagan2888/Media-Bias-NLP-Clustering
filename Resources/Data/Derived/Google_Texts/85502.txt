PHILADELPHIA (CBS) – Consider this: In Pittsburgh, there are 87 patients per doctor. In Philadelphia, there are 258.

According to The Better Doctor Health Opportunity Index run by BetterDoctor.com, a website that helps consumers find local doctors, Philadelphia is facing a doctor shortage.

Coming in sixteenth of 25 cities facing doctor shortages, the City of Brotherly Love has about three times more patients per doctor than Pittsburgh, which ranked fourth on the list of cities with an abundance of doctors. Compare our lack of doctors to the number one city with a wealth of doctors, Greenville, South Carolina; and you’ll find that Philly has five times more patients per physician.

What gives?

Researchers who compiled The Better Doctor Health Opportunity Index attribute it to an increased demand for healthcare – possibly due to Obamacare – as well as the aging population in many cities. The organization also cites data from the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) that shows the nation will be facing a shortage of doctors by 2025.

So, what cities beat out Philly when it comes to a lack of doctors? New York took the number one spot, with 912 residents per doctor, while San Antonio came in second with 531 patients per physician.

And if you’re wondering where – besides Greenville – there are plenty of physicians, Atlanta, the home of the CDC, came in second, while Boston ranked third.
