Fifty years after The University of Alabama was desegregated, “the UA greek system is still almost completely divided along racial lines,” reports UA’s newspaper The Crimson White. Students Abbey Crain and Matt Ford have published a damning report alleging that the university’s alumnae and leadership still prevent black women from joining the school’s historically white sororities.

One account, relayed to the Crimson White by Alpha Gamma Delta member Melanie Gotz:

By any measure, this candidate was what most universities would consider a prime recruit for any organization, sorority or otherwise. She had a 4.3 GPA in high school, was salutatorian of her graduating class and comes from a family with deep roots in local and state public service and a direct link to The University of Alabama. The recruit, who asked to remain anonymous, seemed like the perfect sorority pledge on paper, yet didn’t receive a bid from any of the 16 Panhellenic sororities during formal recruitment. Gotz and others said they know why: The recruit is black. She and at least one other black woman, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of personal safety, went through formal recruitment this year, but neither was offered a bid.

According to Gotz, university alumnae, who must approve all of the sorority’s recruits, denied the admission. “You know, I would say there were probably five people in the room that disagreed with everything that was being said,” said Gotz. “The entire house wanted this girl to be in Alpha Gam. We were just powerless over the alums.”

“How much longer is it going to take till we have a black girl in a sorority?” Gotz asked. “It’s been years, and it hasn’t happened.”
