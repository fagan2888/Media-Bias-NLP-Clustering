But it traveled up from my right ankle with the force of a sonic boom, and it would echo in my dreams weeks after I took that first step out onto the black ice that sheathed the parking lot outside my complex. My fall seemed as slow as distant thunder, and as quick as a lightning flash right outside a window.\n\nMy right ankle, broken. My left ankle, a category three sprain, a mess of screaming ligaments. I\u2019d end up in the E.R., and then in the office of an orthopedic specialist for three consults over the course of six weeks; six weeks in which I was to remain \u201cnon-weight bearing\u201d on my right foot and weight bearing (as barely) tolerated on my left. I\u2019d require rigorous in-home physical therapy before I could use a walker to hurl myself short distances, like some doomed animal with its paw in the teeth of a trap.\n\nWhenever I tell anyone what happened, they always say, \u201cThat sound must\u2019ve been the worst part.\u201d They speak with voices half-hushed in an odd reverence \u2014 as if the magnitude of my injuries merits the awe afforded to natural disasters and the charred matchsticks of houses they leave in their wakes.\n\nThat sound, that everlasting snap haunts me, but it\u2019s not the worst part. The worst part was that first moment after my body hit the ice and before the shock set in: the realizations that I\u2019d just lost the independence that armored me against the world and made me feel strong. And if I wasn\u2019t strong, I needed other people. And if I needed other people, I was nothing \u2014 just a scaffold, weakened and stripped by a gale-force wind, ready to splinter with the slightest breeze.\n\n* * *\n\nStrong became synonymous with impenetrable when I was still losing my baby teeth. My father prized a kind of can-do stoicism straight out of Clint Eastwood\u2019s greatest hits. There were no tears, only whiskey. No room for fear, for any feeling, really, other than an obliterating anger. He taught me, through his absences \u2014 nights passed out on the sofa; weeks when the slightest infraction (a spilled water glass, a yawn that offended him with its timing) provoked an arctic withdrawal, where he wouldn\u2019t so much as look at me \u2014 that needing anyone, for anything, was like being a trapeze artist who, mid-leap, reaches out toward an empty swing. He taught me, through his attention \u2014 eruptions of fists and hushed apologies \u2014 that love, like pain, was something to be endured. And crying always makes it worse.\n\nMy mother lived inside the orbit of her own dependence. She needed him to carry her up every level of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy: to pay the bills, to keep her fed and housed; to be that handsome man with the leather briefcase, to make her the envy of her friends. I saw her helplessness as an unpardonable sin, so self-reliance became my defining virtue.\n\nAs an adult, I did everything I could to live alone. I took basement apartments in bad neighborhoods and lived off dollar meals and Ramen. When I broke my wrist in a car accident seven years ago, I eschewed the pain meds, piloted my rental car and brought in the groceries one-handed; went to work and grad school as if (to quote Don Draper) it never happened. I took pride in refusing any offers of help \u2014 not because they came with strings attached, and not even because I wanted to impress anyone else; because refusing those offers meant I was self-contained, strong enough to endure a world where oblivious people plow their SUVs through stop signs, where little girls are hit harder for crying.\n\n\u201cNope, just me\u201d was my anthem, not a single woman\u2019s lament. I found a Spartan sanctity in hauling 50-pound bags of dog food over my shoulders, and in shouldering the bills on my own. My value wasn\u2019t innate; it was earned by being useful, and not just useful \u2014 but stoic, heroic in shucking off my needs until I honestly believed I didn\u2019t have them. I was always the one you call whenever you need to collect your stuff from your ex, to bitch about your boss, or just cry.\n\nLosing, quite literally, the power to stand on my own two feet felt more devastating than any beating. I needed help with the bedpan; I needed a washcloth rubbed over my back, and I needed the pain pills that swaddled me in a gauzy numbness. I wish I could say that there was one clear catharsis that cracked me open, but I didn\u2019t have some capital-E epiphany \u2014 that redefining strength meant silencing the static of my upbringing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "My violent father taught me strength was independence.
