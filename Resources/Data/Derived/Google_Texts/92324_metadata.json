Its new report added a count of Catholic hospitals acquired by secular health systems which continue to follow religious directives, as well as public or nonprofit hospitals that do not declare an affiliation but are managed or owned by Catholic health systems.\n\nIn all, 14.5 percent of all acute care hospitals in the country are now Catholic-owned or -affiliated, the MergerWatch report said. The concentration is much higher in 10 U.S. states, including Washington, Colorado and Missouri, where more than 30 percent of acute care beds are in Catholic-owned or -affiliated facilities.\n\nThe ACLU said women may be unaware of the restrictions at a particular hospital until they arrive at an emergency room during a miscarriage.\n\nJulia Kaye, a staff attorney with the ACLU Reproductive Freedom Project, has seen an uptick in complaints and litigation since 2013.\n\nKaye said this issue has been a problem for a long time, but \u201cit is gaining more national attention.\u201d\n\nJennafer Norris, 37, contacted the ACLU about her experience eight months ago at a Catholic hospital in Arkansas. She does not plan to file a lawsuit but has begun speaking about her case publicly. The ACLU put Reuters in touch with her.\n\nNorris is a former social worker who was using the long-term contraceptive IUD, or intrauterine device, but became pregnant. She developed high blood pressure and other complications seen during two previous pregnancies.\n\nA doctor at the hospital determined she needed a Caesarian section eight weeks before her due date to protect her and the baby. Norris asked for a tubal ligation at the same time to ensure she would not get pregnant again, but the Catholic hospital refused.\n\n\u201cThey told me I had to go along with their hospital procedures or discharge myself against medical advice and go to another hospital,\u201d said Norris.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News, abortion, Catholic, health care", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) A growing number of U.S. hospitals are now owned or affiliated with Catholic health institutions that restrict procedures such as sterilizations or abortion.", "title": "Watchdog finds much larger Catholic influence on US hospitals", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2016/05/06/watchdog-finds-much-larger-catholic-influence-on-u-s-hospitals/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CATHOLIC-HOSPITALS-cropped.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/05/06/watchdog-finds-much-larger-catholic-influence-on-u-s-hospitals/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2016/05/06/watchdog-finds-much-larger-catholic-influence-on-u-s-hospitals/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "NEW YORK (Reuters) A growing number of U.S. hospitals are now owned or affiliated with Catholic health institutions that restrict procedures such as sterilizations or abortion."}, "article_summary": "\u201cIn general, Catholic hospitals provide excellent care,\u201d said Lois Uttley, director of MergerWatch and an author of the report.\n\u201cOur concern is with these restrictions with reproductive health care.\u201dThe Catholic Health Association could not comment on the report before it was made public.\nMergerWatch\u2019s last count of Catholic-owned or -affiliated hospitals, released in 2013, showed 381 facilities as of 2011, up from 329 in 2001.\nNorris asked for a tubal ligation at the same time to ensure she would not get pregnant again, but the Catholic hospital refused.\nIts new report added a count of Catholic hospitals acquired by secular health systems which continue to follow religious directives, as well as public or nonprofit hospitals that do not declare an affiliation but are managed or owned by Catholic health systems."}
