Kansas Catholics preparing to serve food to hungry students at a Washington D.C. hotel

A winter storm in the eastern part of the United States is effecting students in Kansas.

An estimated 600 students from Kansas area Catholic schools are stranded in Washington D.C. after a winter storm hits the eastern region of the United States.

The students were attending the March For Live event in the nations capital. They were bused in from Kansas; school officials are working with the bus company and others to determine when it will be safe to travel home.

"I didn't think I would ever be stuck here with 600 people to get back to Wichita," said Father Daniel Duling. He traveled with the students and is helping chaperon.

"The kids are doing well. Everything is going well. The only thing we would ask, for the people from Wichita is prayers for our group," he added.

Duling says there is no definite timeline on when they will travel back, saying that safety is driving every decision that they make.
