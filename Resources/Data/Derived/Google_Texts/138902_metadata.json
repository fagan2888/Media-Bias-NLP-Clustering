A new study, published in the journal ELife, pulls the veil back on the brain to demonstrate how we process those initial encounters into memories. Researchers from the University of Haifa in Israel examined the emotional impact of the first impression, revealing it to be a key player in creating memories.\n\n\u201cIt turns out that different emotions cause the brain to work differently and on distinct frequencies,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Dr. Shlomo Wagner, a neuroscientist at U-Haifa, in a press release. \u201cWe found a connection between the feeling of excitement, rhythmical activity in specific brain areas, and the cognitive process of memory formation. In essence, this finding explains why people tend to remember in particular their first encounter with a future friend or partner.\u201d\n\nIn the first stage of the experiment, Wagner and his research team studied rats and traced the areas of the brain that lit up as they socialized with other rats. While rats' brains lit up with excitement when they encountered other rats for the first, researchers were surprised to see the memory-forming part of their brain lit up simultaneously. When the rats met for a second time, the brain activity in the two areas declined.\n\nComparing the two different encounters, researchers found the brain initially worked \u201cintensely\u201d under a unique communication system in order to coordinate the two areas of the brain. But as the animals got to know each other better, the brain\u2019s emotional connectivity weakened. It turns out the carefully calibrated synchronized system of electrical signals is dictated by those first emotions.\n\nThe rat stranger elicited high levels of excitement in the rat\u2019s brain, ultimately facilitating the formation of social memory. But to test their emotions, researchers frightened the rats with other rats, and saw that the brain worked under a different communication system.\n\nWhen a negative emotion like fear is the initial reaction instead of excitement, the brain turns on different electrical signals synchronized with memory formation. It scientifically validates the idea you never get a second chance to make a first impression. \"It seems that when the emotion is social and positive, the brain tells the different areas to work according to one communication protocol,\" Wagner said.\n\nEarlier this year, a team of researchers at New York University\u2019s psychology department discovered the brain\u2019s ability to retrieve memories was improved when associated with emotions. They also found different regions in the brain were influenced by different emotions and that overtime, memories were strengthened. The emotional impact of memories and new experiences may explain why certain emotions progressively develop in the brain.\n\n\u201cWe will need to conduct additional studies in the future in order to understand the precise ramifications of each emotion on memory,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cBut in broad terms the implication is clear. Different emotions cause the brain to work differently, including in terms of cognitive processes such as learning and memory.\u201d\n\nSource: Wagner S and Tendler A.
