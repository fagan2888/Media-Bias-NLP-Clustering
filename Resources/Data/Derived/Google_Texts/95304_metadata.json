Hire someone? Give Zenefits the basic details, and they\u2019ll get them insured, on payroll, etc. Fire someone? Click a button to pull them off payroll and send out the COBRA details. Life event changes? They handle it. And they do it all for free.\n\nIf your company doesn\u2019t have group health coverage, Zenefits can fetch all the quotes you need and help you pick a plan. If your company does already have health covergae, Zenefits still works \u2014 they\u2019ll just take over as your insurance broker.\n\nAt the time, Zenefits only operated in two states: California, and New York. Today, they\u2019re rolling out to all 50.\n\nThere\u2019s one catch, though: for now, they\u2019re only rolling out to the other 48 states for companies with 20+ employees. Come January 1st of 2014, however, they\u2019ll be in all 50 states for all companies with at least two employees.\n\nWhy draw that line? Zenefits CEO Parker Conrad tells me it all comes down to changes in the health insurance system put into play by the Affordable Care Act. Many of those changes don\u2019t go into effect until January 1st, 2014 \u2014 but once they do, it\u2019ll be considerably easier for them to pull insurance data and quotes for smaller teams.\n\nAs you may recall from our previous coverage, Zenefits makes its money by acting as your insurance broker. When a company buys a plan through Zenefits, Zenefits gets a commission from the insurance company. So the small business pays nothing, but Zenefits still makes money for each employee the business brings onboard. Oh, and they make that commission each month. Sweet deal, right?\n\nIn addition to the insurance and payroll services already in place, Zenefits is also introducing a new suite of compliance (read: things you have to do as your company gets bigger) tools. Here\u2019s some of the stuff they handle now:\n\nSending out Affordable Care Act notifications to all new hires\n\nDistributing employee handbooks and handling getting them signed\n\nIn some states, companies with 50+ employees are required to lead sexual harassment training for managers. Zenefits now handles that with a built-in training program.\n\nAutomatically collects Equal Employment Opportunity data as required for companies with 100+ employees and handles reporting it to the government\n\nAs of July of this year, Zenefits had raised $2.1M.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/greg-kumparak/\" title=\"Posts by Greg Kumparak\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Greg Kumparak</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/grg\" rel=\"external\">@grg</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "twitter": {"description": "Back at TC Disrupt NY, Zenefits promised to automate away the most annoying bits involved with running a startup.
