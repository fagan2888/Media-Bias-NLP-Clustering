Does anything come close? https://t.co/m6uBCc6Ytj \u2014 RB (@RBPundit) June 1, 2015\n\nNot something he will violate? Does the president \u2014 or his speechwriters \u2014 think someone other than the American public has been watching the news for the past six year? Reading the papers or cruising the Internet?\n\nOr does he think that that those repeated party line votes in the battle for Obamacare during the disastrous two years that Democrats controlled both houses of Congress meant nothing? Does he forget \u2014 or does he think we forgot \u2014 the incident involving Harvard Professor Louis Gates (the one where the police \u201cacted stupidly\u201d) or how he and his attorney general deliberately fanned the flames of racial hatred in the country over the death of a thug named Trayvon Martin (the one who looked like the president\u2019s imaginary son) who died committing a violent crime.\n\nOr maybe that little matter of Ferguson, Mo., last August slipped his mind. Maybe he doesn\u2019t remember sending three White House officials to attend the funeral of Michael Brown, another thug who died committing a violent crime.\n\nWell, the president and his courtiers might not remember, but social media users do. And they found the president\u2019s posting appalling.\n\n\u201cOne of my core principles is that I will never engage in a politics in which I\u2019m trying to divide people\u201d \u2014@POTUS http://t.co/eKYB5zdKnE \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) June 1, 2015\n\n@moody @exjon @WhiteHouse @POTUS that may be your statement but your actions say divide and conquer.
