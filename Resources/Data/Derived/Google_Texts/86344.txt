A wildfire burning at Mount Fagan has now grown to 893 acres. The fire was sparked by lightning Thursday near Corona de Tucson on the Nogales Ranger District.

Fire managers had been monitoring the wildfire. The Department of Public Safety helicopter is now being used to drop water on the fire when needed. Monsoon storms are expected to knock down some of the flames.

The fire is burning in steep ground and lightning in the area continues to be a safety concern.
