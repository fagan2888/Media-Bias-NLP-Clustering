The owner of Trends Fashion Exchange was injured with a car after shoplifters fleeing the store ran her over in the parking lot.

Roselinde Theobald has owned the business for 17 years; the store is a resale store for young adult clothing. On June 4th, a man and woman came into her store and stole around $500 worth of designer jeans.

Theobald chased the fleeing thieves; the shoplifters were able to get into their car. The car ran over her foot and caused her to fall. She hit her head and after an MRI, she was diagnosed with a concussion.

"I said give me my clothes back and they are starting to back up and they ran over my foot and knocked me to the ground and then I don't remember nothing," Theobald said.

According to Theobald, the man is now in custody but the woman has not been caught.

Images of the thieves were captured on the store's security camera.
