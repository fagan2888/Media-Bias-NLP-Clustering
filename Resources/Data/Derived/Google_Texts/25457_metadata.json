A number of cable, broadband, and telecommunications industry players filed the petition to eliminate pole-attachment rate disparities and complexities between \u201crural\u201d and \u201curban\u201d areas and between and among various defined classes of electronic communication providers. Yesterday\u2019s ruling eliminates remaining loopholes that could have dramatically raised cable operator pole rentals and electric-utility windfalls resulting from the FCC\u2019s February 2015 Net Neutrality order (which we analyzed here) that defined \u201cBroadband Internet Access Service\u201d as a \u201ctelecommunications service.\u201d Specifically, yesterday\u2019s ruling (addressing the petitions of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, COMPTEL, and tw telecom inc.), refined the Commission\u2019s interpretation of the statutory term \u201ccost\u201d to eliminate rate disparities between applications of the \u201ccable\u201d rate defined by section 224(d), and the \u201ctelecom\u201d rate set forth at section 224(e). In a nutshell, the Order adopts scalable cost adjustment factors that apply no matter the average number of attachments. This change decouples the adjustment factors from the Commission\u2019s presumptions of 3 and 5 entities per pole in non-urban and urban areas, creating new adjustment factors for poles with 2 and 4 entities (as well as anything in between). In so doing, the Order ensures that the telecom rate approximates the cable rate, even where utility owners survey their pole attachments to rebut the Commission\u2019s presumptions. These are the factors that the Commission adopted yesterday:\n\n66% for poles with 5 attaching entities\n\n56% for poles with 4 attaching entities\n\n44% for poles with 3 attaching entities\n\n31% for poles with 2 attaching entities\n\nWhere pole owners conduct their own survey and arrive at an entity figure that is fractional (a non-integer), the Commission determined that \u201cthe percentage cost allocator will be located between the whole numbers at the point where it most closely approximates the cost used in the cable rate formula.\u201d While we are continuing to review yesterday\u2019s Order on Reconsideration, on its face it brings further clarity, rationality and economic efficiency to the Commission\u2019s pole attachment rules by eliminating a loophole left by the 2011 Order that was poised for exploitation.
