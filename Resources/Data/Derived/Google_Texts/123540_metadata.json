Credit: Associated Press\n\nBy\n\nA sophomore was nearly at the head of the class.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin runner Sarah Disanza capped off a tremendous campaign with a runner-up finish at the NCAA Cross Country Championships on Saturday in Terre Haute, Ind.\n\nDisanza ran the 6,000-meter race of her life, clocking in at 19 minutes, 39.9 seconds and finishing behind only Iona's Kate Avery, who won the title in 19:31.6.\n\nIt was a huge improvement for Disanza from her first NCAA meet a year ago, where she placed 104th. Her second-place finish marked the best finish by a Badger since 1999 when Erica Palmer won the individual crown.\n\nDisanza was among the leaders early in the race, and moved up from seventh through the first four kilometers to second. Avery build an early lead and maintained a five-second gap on her competition for a majority of the race.\n\n\"I was really just hoping to be getting top 20 overall, but I didn't really expect anything else higher than that,\" Disanza said. \"I was just hoping that if I did, then so be it, it would be a great day. I definitely did not expect that coming in. Placing as high as I did, I'm ecstatic.\"\n\nDisanza's showing enabled the Badgers to finish 10th overall with 382 points. Michigan State won with a score of 85.\n\nIn the men's competition, UW earned its 19th-straight top ten finish. The Badgers finished 10th with a score of 335. Colorado took home the trophy with a total of 65 points.\n\nSophomore Malachy Schrobilgen led the way for the Badgers, finishing 10th in the 10,000-meter race in 30:32.6 seconds. He took 32nd last year.\n\n\"I definitely wanted to improve on last year's finish,\" Schrobilgen said. \"I think last year, I just really didn't know what I was doing out there. I kind of got into the middle of the race and moved up.\n\n\"This year I had the goal of wanting to be top ten, at least top 15. I'm just glad I was able to go out there and accomplish my goal.\"\n\nVOLLEYBALL\n\nJulie Kolinske finished with 17 kills as UW-Milwaukee, the defending Horizon League champions, beat Valparaiso, 25-20, 25-10, 25-19, in the semifinals of the conference tournament in Rochester, Mich.\n\nThe second-seeded Panthers (17-13) will play top-seeded Oakland (21-9) in the title match at 1 p.m. Sunday.\n\nMarquette 3, DePaul 0: Autumn Bailey rammed home 23 kills and the Golden Eagles (24-7, 14-4 Big East) cruised to a 25-18, 25-22, 25-14 victory over the Blue Demons at the Al McGuire Center.\n\nEmory 3, UW-Stevens Point 1: Leah Jacobs had 21 kills and the Eagles downed the Pointers, 26-24, 18-25, 25-13, 27-25, in the semifinals of the NCAA Division III tournament in Newport News, Va.\n\nHOCKEY\n\nBrittany Ammerman had a goal and an assist to lead third-ranked Wisconsin (13-2-1, 11-2-1-0 WCHA) to a 3-0 victory over host St. Cloud State.", "article_metadata": {"title": "UW runner Sarah Disanza takes second in NCAA meet", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/sports/uw-runner-sarah-disanza-takes-second-in-ncaa-meet-b99395746z1-283616921.html", "image": {"width": 1600, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99395746z.1_20141122234411_000_g5m8qvoj.1-1.jpg", "height": 1003}, "type": "article", "description": "University of Wisconsin runner Sarah Disanza capped off a tremendous campaign with a runner-up finish at the NCAA Cross Country Championships on Saturday in Terre Haute, Ind.", "title": "UW runner Sarah Disanza takes second in NCAA meet"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/b99395746z.1_20141122234411_000_g5m8qvoj.1-1.jpg", "description": "University of Wisconsin runner Sarah Disanza capped off a tremendous campaign with a runner-up finish at the NCAA Cross Country Championships on Saturday in Terre Haute, Ind.", "site": "@journalsentinel", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "UW runner Sarah Disanza takes second in NCAA meet"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"admins": "journal.sentinel.1", "app_id": 227386193957280}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-mjs-144-icon.png", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9fad\"", "article_summary": "Iona's Kate Avery wins the women\u2019s title in the NCAA Cross Country Championships, eight seconds ahead of Wisconsin\u2019s Sarah Disanza.\nIt was a huge improvement for Disanza from her first NCAA meet a year ago, where she placed 104th.\nUniversity of Wisconsin runner Sarah Disanza capped off a tremendous campaign with a runner-up finish at the NCAA Cross Country Championships on Saturday in Terre Haute, Ind.\nDisanza was among the leaders early in the race, and moved up from seventh through the first four kilometers to second.\nHer second-place finish marked the best finish by a Badger since 1999 when Erica Palmer won the individual crown."}
