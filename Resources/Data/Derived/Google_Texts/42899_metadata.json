Rivkin Jr., had taken the case on behalf of House Republicans in August, right after they voted to sue the president, accusing him of overstepping the powers of the presidency. Two people with knowledge of the situation said Mr. Rivkin withdrew from the case under pressure after facing criticism that he had taken on an overly partisan lawsuit. Some members of the firm feared the case against Mr. Obama could drive off potential clients and hurt Baker Hostetler\u2019s credibility, according to one of the people with knowledge of the case. Both people said they were prohibited from publicly discussing such a delicate case.\n\nWith Mr. Rivkin\u2019s withdrawal, the House Administration Committee signed a new contract on Friday with William A. Burck, co-head of the Washington office of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan. Mr. Burck had served as outside counsel for the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform when House Republicans sued Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to produce documents related to the botched gunrunning investigation known as Operation Fast and Furious.\n\nHe also represented Maureen McDonnell, the wife of former Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia, in the corruption trial that ended this month with her conviction on nine counts.\n\nNeither Mr. Burck nor representatives for Baker Hostetler returned calls for comment.\n\nAfter Mr. Rivkin took the case, Baker Hostetler was parodied by Jimmy Fallon on the \u201cTonight Show,\u201d which broadcast a fake commercial in which an ambulance-chasing lawyer tries to come up with Obama lawsuits and urges viewers to call a toll-free number.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cAt Baker Hostetler, we specialize in one thing \u2014 suing the president,\u201d the faux infomercial says. \u201cFor instance, have you ever been forced to pass Obamacare, even though you didn\u2019t like it? We can help you waste thousands of dollars in taxpayer money to fight for what you sort of believe in.\u201d\n\nThe measure to sue the president \u2014 which passed 225 to 201 along party lines \u2014 authorized the House to move forward with a lawsuit against Mr. Obama for his application of the Affordable Care Act, which they argued had been selective and intended to delay the law\u2019s most undesirable aspects.\n\n\u201cNo member of this body needs to be reminded about what the Constitution states about the president\u2019s obligation to faithfully execute the laws of our nation,\u201d Speaker John A. Boehner said from the House floor. \u201cAre you willing to let any president choose what laws to execute and what laws to change? Are you willing to let anyone tear apart what our founders have built?\u201d\n\nOne House Democrat, Louise M. Slaughter of New York, called it \u201ca sorry spectacle of legislative malpractice\u201d and \u201cpolitical theater.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit was Mr. Boehner\u2019s way to send a signal that Republicans would fight the president\u2019s efforts to revise laws Congress had passed while not going as far as impeachment, as many on the right would like.\n\nStill, the lawsuit has done little to appease some of the most right wing members of his party. Sarah Palin, for one, responded by calling for Mr. Obama\u2019s impeachment, stirring up the kind of intraparty fight that Mr. Boehner had hoped to avoid.\n\nBut other prominent conservatives ridiculed the lawsuit. Erick Erickson, the blogger and pundit, also called it \u201cpolitical theater\u201d that wasted taxpayer dollars. Mark Levin, the popular radio host and former Reagan administration official, called it a \u201cfoolish move\u201d that made him cringe.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140919205342, "twitter": {"description": "A lawyer withdrew from the case, reportedly under pressure from colleagues concerned about its political aspects.", "title": "Republicans Switch Firm Handling Obama Suit", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/us/politics/republicans-switch-firm-handling-obama-suit.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003127190"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "AshleyRParker", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_150_black.png", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/us/politics/republicans-switch-firm-handling-obama-suit.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003127190", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/us/politics/republicans-switch-firm-handling-obama-suit.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "Sept. 19, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan", "keywords": "United States Politics and Government,United States,Obama  Barack,Rivkin  David B Jr,Burck  William A,Baker & Hostetler LLP,Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan,Boehner  John A,Suits and Litigation (Civil),Law and Legislation,Congress", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Ashley Parker", "SCG": "politics", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Boehner, John A", "byl": "By ASHLEY PARKER", "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A lawyer withdrew from the case, reportedly under pressure from colleagues concerned about its political aspects.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "description": "A lawyer withdrew from the case, reportedly under pressure from colleagues concerned about its political aspects.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Sept. 19, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/ashley_parker/index.html", "section": "Politics", "modified": "2014-09-23", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/politics/index.jsonp", "tag": "Law and Legislation", "published": "2014-09-19", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "geo": "United States", "slug": "20lawsuit", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140923095821, "hdl_p": "Republicans Switch Firm Handling Obama Suit", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/20/us/politics/republicans-switch-firm-handling-obama-suit.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article", "description": "A lawyer withdrew from the case, reportedly under pressure from colleagues concerned about its political aspects.", "title": "Republicans Switch Firm Handling Obama Suit"}, "pdate": 20140919, "des": "Law and Legislation", "articleid": 100000003127190, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Republicans Switch Firm Handling Obama Suit", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccad0\"", "article_summary": "WASHINGTON \u2014 House Republicans on Friday replaced the firm handling their lawsuit against President Obama after the lawyer representing them pulled out over what was said to be political backlash among his colleagues at the firm, Baker Hostetler.\nSome members of the firm feared the case against Mr. Obama could drive off potential clients and hurt Baker Hostetler\u2019s credibility, according to one of the people with knowledge of the case.\nTwo people with knowledge of the situation said Mr. Rivkin withdrew from the case under pressure after facing criticism that he had taken on an overly partisan lawsuit.\n\u201cAre you willing to let any president choose what laws to execute and what laws to change?\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\u201cAt Baker Hostetler, we specialize in one thing \u2014 suing the president,\u201d the faux infomercial says."}
