Marco Rubio is boasting that he\u2019s killed the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHis declaration late last month that he\u2019s delivered a final blow to President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform law is more a wish than the truth. But the Florida senator \u201chas actually done something toward achieving that goal,\u201d The New York Times reported last week.\n\nWhile Rubio hasn\u2019t killed the Affordable Care Act \u2014 enrollments this year are already outpacing last year\u2019s \u2014 the GOP presidential candidate has managed to undermine a temporary provision in the health care law that\u2019s set up to temper the instability inherent in the first years of a health insurance market with millions of new customers, new requirements for health insurance plans and no history to help insurers set premium levels that match health care costs.\n\nA provision Rubio pushed for in last December\u2019s comprehensive budget bill that again made it into the 2016 spending accord reached Tuesday night bars the Obama administration from tapping alternative sources to fund the health care law\u2019s \u201crisk corridor\u201d program. That program transfers money from profitable insurers selling plans on Obamacare\u2019s online exchanges to other insurers so they can partially cover major losses in Obamacare\u2019s first three years.\n\nMany of those insurers ran up losses in the first year of a health insurance market, in which everybody has to sign up for insurance, insurers can no longer turn away patients because of pre-existing health conditions and insurance plans must meet more stringent coverage requirements while limiting consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket costs. Risk corridor payments were one mechanism meant to mitigate those losses so insurers wouldn\u2019t drop out en masse.\n\nBut when the federal government calculated insurers\u2019 risk corridor payments in October, it revealed that profitable insurers had only paid in enough to cover 12.6 percent of the amount owed to insurers that lost money last year. The Rubio provision ensures the federal government can\u2019t use money from other parts of the budget to cover those payments.\n\nThe Florida senator\u2019s move has made life harder for dozens of insurers offering individual and small-group health plans on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s online exchanges and, in particular, for many of the nonprofit insurers created under the law to serve an expanded market of people seeking health coverage. So far, 12 of those 23 nonprofit insurers nationwide have closed their doors, with a number of them citing the risk corridor situation as a factor.\n\nThe Kentucky Health Cooperative, for example, qualified for a $77 million risk corridor payment based on its first-year losses after enrollment exceeded the nonprofit\u2019s original projections by 70 percent. The federal government said in October it could pay only $9.7 million of the $77 million owed; the insurer announced soon after it would shut down.\n\nThe two Maine insurers that offered plans through HealthCare.gov fared better. Community Health Options, the nonprofit Lewiston insurer that claimed more than 80 percent of Maine\u2019s exchange business, was profitable and paid more than $2 million into the risk corridor program. Anthem BlueCross BlueShield hit its 2014 targets for the individual market; it didn\u2019t pay into the risk corridor program, and it didn\u2019t qualify for payments to cover losses.\n\nBut Community Health Options posted its first quarterly loss earlier this year and announced it would stop accepting new individual insurance enrollments after Dec. 26. The risk corridor situation wasn\u2019t a factor, according to Michael Gendreau, the cooperative\u2019s outreach, education and communications director. But since Rubio\u2019s restrictions on the program will continue, Community Health Options may not be able to collect all it\u2019s owed in the future.\n\nRubio, meanwhile, joins many Republicans in calling Obamacare a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d and clamoring for its repeal \u2014 a move that would deprive more than 20 million people of health coverage and add to the federal deficit. On his campaign website, Rubio says the country \u201cneeds health care reform that will \u2026 harness the forces of competition to keep health care prices low and spur innovation.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Rubio has played a role in ensuring there\u2019s less competition and, therefore, less innovation in the private insurance market created by Obamacare. And to the extent Obamacare is a train wreck not fully allowed to succeed because of stubborn opposition, it\u2019s a train wreck of Rubio and other Republicans\u2019 making.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Editorial: Sen.
