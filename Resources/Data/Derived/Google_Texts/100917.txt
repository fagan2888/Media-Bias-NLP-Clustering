Marianna Police have obtained an arrest warrant for the man who robbed a woman outside of a Dollar General back in February.

Police are searching for Alan Henderson, 50, on robbery and grand theft charges.

Officials state back in February, Henderson approached a victim at the Dollar General on Lafayette Street in Marianna and grabbed her by her neck and told her to open her car.

The victim then told police she fell to the ground, and Henderson grabbed her purse and fled the scene.

Police were then able to obtain additional video footage of the suspect, as well as another person of interest and a vehicle they were traveling in.

Marianna officials say Henderson is believed to be in the Orlando, Fla. area at this time. Henderson has an extensive criminal history and is currently on probation in Alabama.
