The ongoing popularity of the second-round playoff series would have meant more viewers \u2014 and eventually more advertising revenue.\n\nAudience ratings figures:\n\n\u2022 Game 6 in Chicago, aired Thursday on ESPN, averaged 6.4 million viewers, second only to Game 4 (May 3, viewed by 6.9 million).\n\n\u2022 Game 6 was up 24 percent over the Indiana-Washington second-round Eastern Conference contest in 2014.\n\n\u2022 Four of the five most-watched NBA playoff games this season featured the Bulls and Cavaliers.\n\n\u2022 The six games were the most-watched second-round playoff contests since 2012.\n\nThe driving force behind this audience rating surge is, of course, LeBron James, who will lead Cleveland in the Eastern Conference finals against the Atlanta Hawks on TNT.\n\nThis is James\u2019 fifth consecutive appearance in the East finals. His strong season-long performance has taken a team that went 33-49 in the 2013-14 season to the conference finals.\n\nThe Miami Heat? James\u2019 former team finished 37-45 this season and missed the playoffs.\n\nCharles Barkley recently said it best: \u201cTelevision needs LeBron James in the championship finals.\u201d\n\nIce Age returns. NHL playoff audience figures on NBCSN are slightly ahead of last year\u2019s, highlighted by the Rangers\u2019 win in a widely watched Game 7 battle against the Capitals, which produced the second-largest second-round audience ever on cable\u2019s NHL coverage.\n\nAs one New York sports columnist noted: \u201cWho needs the Knicks? We\u2019ve got the Rangers!\u201d\n\nAlumni report. Often overlooked in the ongoing coverage of Deflategate is a local angle.\n\nThe initial story was broken by Bob Kravitz, a writer-reporter for WTHR-TV in Indianapolis. He was a sports columnist at the Rocky Mountain News from 1990-2000.\n\nHis first report came shortly after the Patriots beat the Colts in the AFC championship game.\n\nKravitz left Denver to become a sports columnist at The Indianapolis Star. He was there until 2014, when he moved into tele- vision work.\n\nKravitz, in recent e-mails, Facebook and Twitter coverage, has recalled the ongoing criticism \u2014 and sometimes oral abuse \u2014 he and his family have received from Patriots fans.\n\nAlso, Kravitz has been in a constant battle with the Boston media and Patriots management \u2014 a battle intensified by the release of the Wells report and the team\u2019s punishment by the NFL.\n\nBound for Big Apple. After 15 years of being based at ESPN headquarters in Bristol, Conn., the \u201cMike and Mike in the Morning\u201d show will move to New York on Feb. 8, after Super Bowl 50. The move is being made to give Mike Greenberg and Mike Golic more access to the worlds of sports and pop culture in a big-city environment.\n\nThe popular weekday series, aired in Denver on 105.5 FM (5-10 a.m.) and also on ESPN2, will emanate from ABC\u2019s Times Square Broadcasting Center, thus giving the duo more access to the talent and guests on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\nESPN noted that during studio breaks, ESPN2 cameras will focus on the sights and sounds of Manhattan, which should have more appeal than downtown Bristol.\n\nLongtime Denver journalist Dusty Saunders writes about sports media each Monday in The Denver Post.
