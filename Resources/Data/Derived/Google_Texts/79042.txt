Cody Rhodes has issued a statement on his WWE release. Rhodes stated yesterday that he asked for his release from the company, which was granted today. You can check out his statement from Twitter below. Rhodes says that he was creatively frustrated and begged the WWE to let him abandon the Stardust character.

Rhodes also took shots at WWE creative, saying one of the heads of creative was 'busy hitting on developmental divas,' and the other was pretending to be Brian Gewirtz.

My one&only statement on the matter. No podcasts or tell-all nonsense.
