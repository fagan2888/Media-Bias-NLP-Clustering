The expansion, which the Supreme Court made optional, took effect in those states on Wednesday.\n\nThe Obama administration hoped that through its health overhaul, people who were covered by Medicaid or subsidized private-insurance plans would have primary-care doctors and thus would have greater access to preventive health care, reducing the need for expensive emergency room visits.\n\nThe new findings may not affect Obamacare supporters\u2019 plea to expand Medicaid in more states from a moral perspective, but they\u2019re likely to raise concerns about its fiscal impact, a point Mr. Obama repeatedly made trying to sell his health-care plan politically.\n\nMany Republican-led states already were leery of the expansion\u2019s costs.\n\nThe federal government only will pay the full tab for newly eligible people from 2014-2016 but then scale back its contribution to 90 percent by 2020.\n\n\u201cThis is an important study which confirms that there is no free lunch when you expand insurance coverage \u2014 if we are going to cover more folks with insurance, it is going to raise medical spending,\u201d said Jon Gruber, an MIT professor who helped craft health reforms in Massachusetts before aiding the Obama administration with its nationwide model.\n\nWhite House deputy senior adviser David Simas said Thursday that extending the benefits to more people \u201cis the right thing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe expect that more and more states are going to be doing this going forward,\u201d he said during a conference call.\n\nMr. Gruber, of MIT, said the real question is how much that medical spending increases each year under the health care law.\n\nHe said the rate of increase has slowed, significantly, under the law, \u201cso this is a tiny price to pay for covering 30 million Americans with health insurance, improving financial security and health for a huge share of the American public.\u201d\n\nThe Oregon study tracked people in the Portland area who were entered into the lottery. Some were selected to gain Medicaid coverage and some weren\u2019t, giving researchers a way to compare ER use patterns. The researchers did say that other studies showed that after Massachusetts enacted its own health reforms in 2006, ER use went down or remained unchanged.", "article_metadata": {"description": "By urging states to expand Medicaid, Obamacare may actually increase the number of people who will get medical care from emergency rooms, according to a new report Thursday that counters previous Obama administration claims that the Affordable Care Act would stem the need for emergency visits.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "By urging states to expand Medicaid, Obamacare may actually increase the number of people who will get medical care from emergency rooms, according to a new report Thursday that counters previous Obama administration claims that the Affordable Care Act would stem the need for emergency visits.", "title": "Report: Obamacare may increase use of emergency rooms", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/2/study-obamacare-reform-increased-use-emergency-roo/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/11/health-overhaul-keeping-scorejpeg-07f98.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/11/health-overhaul-keeping-scorejpeg-07f98.jpg", "description": "By urging states to expand Medicaid, Obamacare may actually increase the number of people who will get medical care from emergency rooms, according to a new report Thursday that counters previous Obam", "card": "summary", "title": "Report: Obamacare may increase use of emergency rooms"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Social Issues, Barack Obama, Mit"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1fd4\"", "article_summary": "By urging states to expand Medicaid, Obamacare may actually increase the number of people who will get medical care from emergency rooms, according to a new report Thursday that counters previous Obama administration claims that the Affordable Care Act would stem the need for emergency visits.\nMr. Gruber, of MIT, said the real question is how much that medical spending increases each year under the health care law.\nThe Medicaid study, published Thursday in the journal Science, says Oregonians who obtained Medicaid benefits in a 2008 lottery used emergency rooms at a 40 percent higher rate than did people who remained uninsured.\nSome were selected to gain Medicaid coverage and some weren\u2019t, giving researchers a way to compare ER use patterns.\nThe spike in visits involved a variety of medical conditions, including ones that could have been treated in a primary care setting."}
