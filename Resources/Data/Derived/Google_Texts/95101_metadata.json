In fact, couples should have to obtain a permit to become parents:\n\nArticle 3. A marriage license shall in itself give husband and wife only the right to a common household and not the right to parenthood. Article 4. No woman shall have the legal right to bear a child, and no man shall have the right to become a father, without a permit for parenthood. Article 5. Permits for parenthood shall be issued upon application by city, county, or state authorities to married couples, providing they are financially able to support the expected child, have the qualifications needed for proper rearing of the child, have no transmissible diseases, and, on the woman\u2019s part, no medical indication that maternity is likely to result in death or permanent injury to health. Article 6. No permit for parenthood shall be valid for more than one birth.\n\n\u201cAll that sounds highly revolutionary, and it might be impossible to put the scheme into practice,\u201d Sanger wrote.\n\nShe added: \u201cWhat is social planning without a quota?\u201d \u2014\u201cAmerica Needs a Code for Babies,\u201d March 27, 1934, Margaret Sanger Papers, Library of Congress, 128:0312B\n\n8) She believed that large families were detrimental to society.\n\n\u201cThe most serious evil of our times is that of encouraging the bringing into the world of large families. The most immoral practice of the day is breeding too many children,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cThe most merciful thing that the large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it,\u201d she continued. \u2014\u201cWoman and the New Race,\u201d 1920, Chapter 5: The Wickedness of Creating Large Families\n\n9) She argued that motherhood must be \u201cefficient.\u201d\n\n\u201cBirth control itself, often denounced as a violation of natural law, is nothing more or less than the facilitation of the process of weeding out the unfit, of preventing the birth of defectives or of those who will become defectives,\u201d Sanger wrote. \u2014\u201cWoman and the New Race,\u201d 1920, Chapter 18: The Goal\n\n10) Population control, she wrote, would bring about the \u201cmaterials of a new race.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we are to develop in America a new race with a racial soul, we must keep the birth rate within the scope of our ability to understand as well as to educate. We must not encourage reproduction beyond our capacity to assimilate our numbers so as to make the coming generation into such physically fit, mentally capable, socially alert individuals as are the ideal of a democracy,\u201d Sanger wrote. \u2014\u201cWoman and the New Race,\u201d 1920, Chapter 3: The Materials of the New Race\n\n11) Sanger wrote that an excess in population must be reduced.\n\n\u201cWar, famine, poverty and oppression of the workers will continue while woman makes life cheap,\u201d she wrote.\n\nMothers, \u201cat whatever cost, she must emerge from her ignorance and assume her responsibility.\u201d \u2014\u201cWoman and the New Race,\u201d 1920, Chapter 1: Woman\u2019s Error and Her Debt\n\n12) \u201cWe do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population,\u201d Sanger wrote. \u2014Letter to Dr. Clarence Gamble on Dec., 10, 1939\n\n13) In an interview with Mike Wallace in 1957, Sanger said, \u201cI think the greatest sin in the world is bringing children into the world, that have disease from their parents, that have no chance in the world to be a human being practically.\u201d\n\n\u201cDelinquents, prisoners, all sorts of things just marked when they\u2019re born. That to me is the greatest sin\u2014that people can\u2014can commit,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Margaret Sanger started the American Birth Control League in 1921; it became part of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1942.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Margaret Sanger started the American Birth Control League in 1921; it became part of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1942.", "title": "13 Controversial Quotes From Planned Parenthood's Founder", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150715_MargaretSanger_Scanlon.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-22T09:32:58+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1CTPMaY"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Margaret Sanger started the American Birth Control League in 1921; it became part of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America in 1942.", "title": "13 Controversial Quotes From Planned Parenthood's Founder", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/150715_MargaretSanger_Scanlon.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Protecting Life", "published_time": "2015-07-22T03:01:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-22T09:32:58+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Planned Parenthood, Margaret Sanger, abortion, pro-life, prolife, Center for Medical Progress, undercover video, #PPSellsBabyParts"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1e49\"", "article_summary": "\u201cAll that sounds highly revolutionary, and it might be impossible to put the scheme into practice,\u201d Sanger wrote.\nPlanned Parenthood praises Sanger for \u201cproviding contraception and other health services\u201d and \u201cadvancing access to family planning in the United States and around the world.\u201dIn addition to Planned Parenthood, Sanger also founded the Birth Control Review, a journal about contraception and population control.\nNo permit for parenthood shall be valid for more than one birth.\nNo woman shall have the legal right to bear a child, and no man shall have the right to become a father, without a permit for parenthood.\nPlanned Parenthood, engulfed in a scandal following the release of two undercover videos, is the largest abortion provider in the United States."}
