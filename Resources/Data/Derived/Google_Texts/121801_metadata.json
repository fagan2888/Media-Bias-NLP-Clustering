Key members of the Freedom Caucus, who in the past have ranged from skeptical to outwardly distrustful of leadership, are mostly aligned with the goals laid out by Ryan and cautiously optimistic they will be met.\n\n\u201cWe certainly think that the speaker talking about the distinction, talking about the difference, highlighting these and talking about big, bold policy initiatives, we think that is right on target,\u201d Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan told RealClearPolitics in an interview at the retreat.\n\nIt marks a departure from the discord within the House Republican conference at the same gathering a year ago. But it will take a heavy lift to craft these conservative policies, let alone to get them passed in the House \u2013 which will likely be the end of the line, as the Senate and President Obama are disinclined to go along. While Ryan and Freedom Caucus members appear to be agreement for now, some significant roadblocks lie ahead.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus in 2015\n\nIn January, nine House members formed the group at the Republican retreat and quickly recruited enough conservatives to cause major problems for party leaders.\n\nThe first dispute, in February over funding for the Department of Homeland Security amid a fight tied to Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, played out similarly to past battles. The House passed a bill defunding the executive actions, which couldn\u2019t get through the Senate over Democratic objections. The Senate passed a \u201cclean\u201d bill funding DHS and the House, after some late-night drama and one stopgap measure, agreed, over the objections of a significant majority of Republicans. The deal infuriated Freedom Caucus members and set the stage for much of the GOP discord for the rest of the year.\n\nIn July, that discord culminated in North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, presenting a motion to remove Boehner from the speakership. It marked a significant ratcheting up of the animosity within the conference. When the House returned from its summer recess in September, questions remained about Boehner\u2019s future, especially given concerns over how to fund the government while also trying to repeal Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood. It was a familiar position for the House GOP.\n\nIn the end, Boehner announced his retirement and secured a budget agreement, again without the support of a majority of Republicans. Following weeks of uncertainty, the GOP conference, including a majority of the Freedom Caucus \u2013 though notably not enough for an endorsement \u2013 coalesced around Ryan for the top job.\n\nRep. Matt Salmon, one of the founders of the caucus, said it was \u201cphenomenal\u201d how quickly they were able to effect change in the House.\n\n\u201cI think I realized all along that if you could get enough resolve among a nucleus of people, a fairly decent nucleus of people, you can accomplish a lot,\u201d the Arizona Republican said. \u201cAlmost everybody in Washington is so scattered, if you can unify a bloc, you have incredible ability and I think we\u2019ve proved that.\"\n\nConservative Policy Proposals\n\nRyan has emphasized a major point when selling his agenda for this year: With Obama in the White House, it isn\u2019t going to become law. Instead, he\u2019s made it clear the biggest driver of those plans is electing a Republican to the White House. There, Ryan and the Freedom Caucus are in complete lock step.\n\n\u201cFor me, 2016 is about doing all we can to help elect a Republican president,\u201d Jordan told RCP. \u201cThis is where the speaker has been, I think, very good talking about tax reform, health care reform, welfare reform, how we would secure the country. Showing the difference, showing the distinction, showing how, here\u2019s where Obama, [former Secretary of State Hillary] Clinton, [and Vermont Sen. Bernie] Sanders are; here\u2019s where we think the American people are and where we are as conservatives and Republicans.\u201d\n\nFor most conservatives, however, just laying out the policies isn\u2019t enough. They want to see them make it through the entire legislative process \u2013 from subcommittees to committees to the House floor for a vote.\n\n\u201cWe should have votes,\u201d said Rep. Justin Amash. \u201cPeople at home are not going to be happy if we just put out ideas but don\u2019t actually try to implement those ideas.\u201d The Michigan lawmaker said many in the party are too quick to blame the Senate or White House, rather than trying to \u201cpersuade\u201d Democrats and Republicans alike on their ideas.\n\nJordan agreed that there needs to be votes on the policy proposals, but added he\u2019s under \u201cno delusions\u201d that Obama would sign any of the legislation. Instead, he echoed a point Ryan has made that it\u2019s about setting up the agenda for a Republican president in 2017.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you want to pass them now, because the ones that pass now, if we get a Republican president, they\u2019ve already passed. Bring them up, let\u2019s go, pass them and send them on,\u201d Jordan said.\n\nBoehner never had the confidence of the Freedom Caucus during the final year of his speakership, even when he held votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act or defund Planned Parenthood. Salmon said he \u201cnever really had high expectations for John Boehner because I didn\u2019t think it was in him.\u201d With Ryan, however, the bar is high.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic,\u201d Salmon said. \u201cI think Paul, his heart\u2019s in the right place and I think somebody as energetic and brilliant as he is, I think he should be able to get it done. He\u2019ll have a lot of willing accomplices, but we\u2019ve seen a lot of things miss the mark over the years, so I\u2019m cautiously optimistic.\u201d\n\nReforming the Budget Process\n\nAnother key goal for the Freedom Caucus is to end the habit of funding the government through omnibus deals and instead pass 12 separate appropriations bills funding individual departments of the government. This is also a goal for Ryan and the main objective for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nIt may sound simple, but all 12 spending bills haven\u2019t been signed into law in more than two decades, so it may prove a complex task, particularly in an election year when Congress spends much of the summer on the campaign trail.\n\nSalmon, who was in Congress for three terms from 1995-2001 and elected again in 2012, said it would be \u201cmonumental\u201d to pass all of the appropriations bills. He said without getting the budget and appropriations process fixed, grand policy proposals are much less likely.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the predominant cause of the dysfunction here, that we can\u2019t even get our act together to do our most basic job, and that is to authorize and appropriate,\u201d Salmon said. \u201cHow can we ever even contemplate the big stuff when we can\u2019t do the required stuff?\u201d\n\nHere, however, Republicans might hit a snag. The agreement negotiated by Boehner in the final days of his speakership increased spending by $80 billion and 167 Republicans voted against it. Amash said conservatives would fight for spending levels below what was agreed to last year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not right to draft a budget at the higher number when most Republicans don\u2019t support the higher number,\u201d he said. Jordan echoed those concerns and added that the budget agreement \u201csets the framework for how we move forward.\u201d A fight within the Republican conference over spending levels would seriously complicate the appropriations process this year.\n\nIt might also complicate the one method by which Republicans could actually see one of their broad policy ideas reach the president\u2019s desk. With last year\u2019s budget, Republicans used a complex process known as reconciliation \u2013 which allows the Senate to bypass a filibuster \u2013 to repeal significant parts of Obamacare and defund Planned Parenthood, forcing Obama to veto the measures.\n\nJordan floated the possibility of using reconciliation this year to pass welfare reform and put it on Obama\u2019s desk. But without a budget agreement, reconciliation isn\u2019t possible and any chance of getting major conservative legislation on the president\u2019s desk significantly diminishes.\n\nLeaving the retreat in Baltimore last week, both Freedom Caucus members and GOP leadership appeared optimistic they could find success via the agenda they\u2019ve laid out for this year. But that optimism came with a grain of salt.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this before,\u201d Amash said. \u201cThe words that are said need to be met with action. So let\u2019s see what happens over the next year and we\u2019ll be in a better position to assess how we\u2019re doing as a conference.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "BALTIMORE \u2013 One year ago, a group of conservatives frustrated with the direction of Republican Party formed the Freedom Caucus and, within that year, disrupted GOP leadership to the point of...", "title": "One Year Later, Freedom Caucus Upbeat on 2016 Goals | RealClearPolitics", "fragment": "!", "twitter": {"site": "@RealClearNews", "card": "summary"}, "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2016/01/19/one_year_later_freedom_caucus_upbeat_on_2016_goals_129356.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/341281_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "BALTIMORE \u2013 One year ago, a group of conservatives frustrated with the direction of Republican Party formed the Freedom Caucus and, within that year, disrupted GOP leadership to the point of...", "title": "One Year Later, Freedom Caucus Upbeat on 2016 Goals | RealClearPolitics"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "tweetmeme-title": "One Year Later, Freedom Caucus Upbeat on 2016 Goals | RealClearPolitics", "keywords": "House Republicans,Paul Ryan,Justin Amash,Jim Jordan,Freedom Caucus,"}, "article_summary": "The deal infuriated Freedom Caucus members and set the stage for much of the GOP discord for the rest of the year.\nWhile Ryan and Freedom Caucus members appear to be agreement for now, some significant roadblocks lie ahead.\nIn July, that discord culminated in North Carolina Rep.
