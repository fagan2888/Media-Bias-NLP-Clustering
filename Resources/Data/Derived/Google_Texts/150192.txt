Drought worries deepen for groundwater users

• Drill deeper? Or is there another solution? • Some of our wells are reaching historic lows

My first car, a 1970 Ford Maverick, was reliable whenever it had gas. The odometer worked but the speedometer and fuel gauge didnt. It supposedly had a 20-gallon tank. My dad warned me to fill it every 300 miles. Id recharge the tank with a few gallons whenever I had spare change. I once ran out of gas during a date, which was followed by an awkward conversation I had with her father. I should have kept better records. My self-imposed tragedy stemmed from a lack of common sense.

California faces a possible fourth consecutive year of drought. The El Nino we await projects to be as wimpy as the Oakland Raider offense. The Raiders can fire coaches or trade players, like water managers can transfer surface water between basins, but we mere humans cant make it rain. Ah, but groundwater, stored in our underground bank account, is our back-up plan. The problem though is that groundwater basins, like my Mavericks gas tank, have finite capacities. And were not exactly sure where we are on the fill gauge.

According to the University of California Cooperative Extension Service, nearly 57,000 wells provide groundwater for agricultural and domestic uses in the five northern Central Valley counties of Shasta, Tehama, Glenn, Butte and Colusa. Lake Shasta, the headwaters of the Central Valley Project, stores Sacramento River water, which flows south past Tehama, Glenn, Butte and Colusa Counties before reaching the Delta.

The region hosts nearly two million irrigable acres including pasture, orchard and row crops, and rice. Cities like Red Bluff, Corning, Orland, and Willows, all just an exit ramp off Interstate 5, use groundwater. East of I-5 and between the Sacramento River and the western Sierra foothills sits Chico, where its nearly 100,000 residents also rely on groundwater.

Declining groundwater levels in foothill domestic wells and in older wells located outside urban areas concern us, says Paul Gosselin, director of the Butte County Department of Water and Resource Conservation. Butte County monitors spring and fall groundwater levels. Domestic wells built in the 1970s and earlier are typically shallower than younger wells built in the 1980s and later, he says.

Adds Butte County Environmental Health Director Brad Banner, Weve seen a lot of well repairs and deepenings, where pumps are lowered to reach water levels.

Chicos crown jewel, Bidwell Park, a popular recreation area for hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding, is not immune to drought impacts.

At the Five Mile Recreation Area weve struggled with a localized drought problem, says Park and Natural Resource Manager Dan Efseaff.

Big Chico Creek, habitat for salmon and steelhead, flows through the Five Mile Area. The creek supports a usually lush riparian forest and local groundwater. Chicos municipal system provides drinking water at picnic sites, but a shallow well provides water for toilets and irrigation.

We had to lower the well 40 feet this summer, says Mr. Efseaff. Over the past few years weve transitioned part of the turf to native grasses, sedges, and native forest to reduce irrigation needs. We hope to reduce water needs in the park by 20 percent. Mr. Efseaff also points to the installation of new waterless urinals in restrooms.

Can Chico irrigate using Big Chico Creek? No, says Mr. Efseaff, we dont have surface water rights. Plus we dont want to adversely affect the salmon run.

The California Water Service Company (NASDAQ: CWT), of San Jose, provides Chicos municipal supply. Some of our wells are reaching historic lows, says Pete Bonacich, interim district manager. But many of our wells are stable. We havent lowered pumps or deepened wells. Water conservation helps but we need rain.

Several miles south of Chico, in the unincorporated area of Durham, falling groundwater levels concern residents. Durham is surrounded by almond and walnut orchards, permanent crops that need water year-round, not just to thrive but to simply stay alive.

The state will eventually want farmers to meter pumps and to report well information, says Ed McLaughlin, an almond grower and former Butte County Supervisor. I have no problems with that. It will help us protect ourselves. Mr. McLaughlin laments, Were aware of land subsidence [the sinking of the land surface] in the Central Valley caused by groundwater overdraft. Every resource has a limit.

Local basin knowledge of the Northern Sacramento Valleys hydrology varies. The California Department of Water Resources-Northern Regional Office in Red Bluff has monitored and mapped the region since the 1990s. Butte County recently completed an investigation on local aquifer characteristics, boundaries, and recharge areas. West of the Sacramento River, irrigation districts drilled test wells to investigate aquifer depth and conducted pump tests to evaluate aquifer performance.

The underlying theme is that the North Valley geology is not uniform. There are confined and unconfined layers, some of them hydrologically connected and some not. The geologic system is very complex with interlaced hydrology, says Glenn County Water Resources Coordinator Lisa Hunter.

Put simply, the North Valleys geology isnt layered like a wedding cake nor is it a bathtub. Think more like a pile of spaghetti noodles with water flowing up, down, sideways or diagonally.

We monitor over 260 dedicated wells, says Debbie Spangler, an engineering geologist with DWRs Northern Regional Office. Since 2004 weve observed groundwater elevation declines of nearly 40 feet within the intermediate aquifer [the zone between 200 and 600 feet]. Declines west of Corning and Orland are worrisome. Were evaluating subsidence data but the analysis is incomplete.

Glenn Countys Water Advisory Committee wrestles with community concern. Some people are drying out and blaming others, says WAC member Larry Domenighini. Those who have issues must volunteer well information. Are well logs available? Are neighboring wells encountering similar problems? Coffee shop complaining doesnt help.

Historically low groundwater levels can definitely lead to land subsidence, says Chris Bonds, a senior engineering geologist with DWRs North Central Region Office in West Sacramento. We just dont know when or where it may happen. Land subsidence affects water flows in canals and impacts infrastructure like roads and levees. Currently, subsidence is especially problematic in the San Joaquin and Tulare Lake regions.

DWR installed extensometers and wells to measure changes in groundwater and land elevations in the Sacramento Valley over twenty years ago. Eleven extensometers cover the region, ranging in depth from over 700 feet to nearly 1,100 feet.

Back then, extensometers cost upwards of $250,000 per site. Without good measurement records we wouldnt know whats occurring at these locations today, and we probably wouldnt be having this conversation, says the DWRs Mr. Bonds. Many groundwater issues experienced in California are classic examples of the Tragedy of the Commons.
