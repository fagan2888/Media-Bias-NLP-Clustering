An earlier version had no new money for the agency, even though it will be saddled with new responsibilities.\n\nThe bill aims to get needed medicines to the public faster and seeks to streamline clinical trials.\n\nThe legislation also would give additional market exclusivity if an approved drug is modified to treat a rare disease. The drug maker would get an additional six-month monopoly and prevent any generic copycats of the product to reach the market.\n\nIt would also create a new regulatory pathway to swiftly approve medical devices that treat a life-threatening disease.\n\nA new part of the bill would shield industry-paid FDA user fees from any future sequester-related spending caps. The agency said it has lost more than $80 million in user-fee funding due to sequestration.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House lawmakers want to sell crude oil reserves to pay for a billion-dollar bill aimed at hastening the development of new health treatments for the public.\nThe House Energy and Commerce Committee proposed selling 8 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to pay for the 21st Century Cures Act.
