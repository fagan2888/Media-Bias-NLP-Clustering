× Denver Union Station grand opening delayed until July 26

DENVER — Denver Union Station announced Wednesday that the historical building’s official grand opening has been pushed back to July 26 to give tenants more time to settle into their new spaces and begin business operations.

The grand opening event, which was previously scheduled for July 12, will be held July 26 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., Union Station Alliance spokeswoman Julie Dunn said.

She said the public opening was delayed to grant businesses inside of the station to a “soft-opening period” so they can prepare and plan for larger crowds on July 26.

The public grand opening celebration will highlight the building’s various restaurants and retailers as well as host a street festival featuring Colorado bands, food trucks and vendors.

Prior to this event, access to both the station and Great Hall may be limited, but the Crawford Hotel will be open for business.

The Great Hall Gala on July 11 and the VIP Champagne Reception on July 12 remain as scheduled.
