Below the streets or under the boardwalk. Buried deep in the earth or sequestered in a control room.\n\n\"Every single town we work for is renewing their investment in the infrastructure, to keep their essential services in operation,\" said Francis Mullan, a civil engineer and vice president of T&M Associates of Middletown, which is doing about 50 projects in the bayshore alone.\n\nMullan won\u2019t use the term \"hurricane-proof,\" opting instead for \"battleship-grade\" for the new nuts-and-bolts stuff.\n\nStorm drainage systems blown out by the Sandy tidal surge are being replaced with thicker pipes or retention basins. Some are made of hard plastics that salt water cannot corrode. Weathered or broken wood bulkheads are being replaced by thicker, impervious vinyl.\n\nElectrical transformers are being \"hardened\" as Mullan says, encased in watertight metal and put up higher on concrete pedestals.\n\n\"This protects them not only from the surge of water, but from being damaged by debris,\" Mullan said.\n\nThe carnival lights and rides on Casino Pier this summer were powered by four large encased generators sitting on solid six-foot high concrete blocks, bringing them to slightly above boardwalk level. Before the storm, they were below street level.\n\n\"They\u2019re eight or nine above where they were,\" Elliott said.\n\nUnder the new planks of the boardwalk is a new structure that is using at least twice the lumber of the structure Sandy destroyed.\n\nThere are 3,000 new pilings holding up the 101,000-square-foot pier.\n\nThey are a heavier grade, wider and spaced more closed together and driven deeper into the ground.\n\n\"These are 7\u00bd-feet apart,\" Elliott said. \"Some of the old ones were 10 or 12 feet apart, depending on when that piece of the boardwalk was built.\"\n\nThe pilings are just one example of more strength. Every piece of lumber going into the boardwalk is wider and thicker than what it replaced.\n\nRust-proof galvanized bolts fasten the piles to the sub-flooring, known as the pile cap, and there are now two levels of horizontal, stabilizing boards bolted to the pilings where before there was none. Underneath, the water, gas and electric lines are encased in galvanized steel.\n\n\"Would it survive another Sandy? Let\u2019s just say it would have a better chance,\" Elliott said.\n\nA few miles north, the Lord House Lifeguard Station at one of Toms Rivers\u2019 public beaches is under construction. The old shack was scheduled to be replaced before the storm hit.\n\nAll the hurricane did was save the town demolition costs. And those savings were sunk, literarily, into fortifying the new design.\n\nThe foundation for the new lifeguard station looks like it could support a train station. There are 12 solid concrete stanchions, each 18-inches-by-18-inches.\n\nThose stanchions are anchored to a two-foot thick concrete cap, which cover concrete-encased pilings that go 25 feet below ground. Some of those are vertical, and others are angled for lateral support\n\nAround the foundation are 8-inch-thick concrete walls. All this will be behind replenished 25-foot dunes. The cost: $1.1 million.\n\n\"Pre-Sandy, this might have seemed excessive,\" said Robert Chankalian, the township engineer. \"Post-Sandy, it seems reasonable.\"\n\nReasonable, too, are some other technological advances or ideas.\n\nFor instance, the next time there is a Sandy, there will be a new \"geographic information system\" that will show work crews exactly where to locate the shut-off valves for gas lines, without digging through the sand, so that fires that consumed places like Camp Osborn in Brick Township and Breezy Point, Queens, could be controlled.\n\nCall it smarter than the storm.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'hurricane-sandy','seaside-heights','toms-river'", "title": "Under the boardwalk, under the roads, Jersey rebuilds stronger than storm", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Under the boardwalk, under the roads, Jersey rebuilds stronger than storm\", \"link\": \"http://blog.nj.com/njv_mark_diionno/2013/11/under_the_boardwalk_under_the.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/njv_mark_diionno/photo/sandy-rebuilding-jim-elliottjpg-fe0377661fcf05ef.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11555568\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-02T10:28:56Z\", \"author\": \"Mark Di Ionno | The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"hurricane-sandy\",\"seaside-heights\",\"toms-river\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/njv_mark_diionno/photo/13694268-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@MarkDiIonno", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Jim Elliott, construction manager at Casino Pier in Seaside Heights, shows off the stronger boardwalk architecture.
