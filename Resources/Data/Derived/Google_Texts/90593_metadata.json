I am not fond of holiday stories.\n\nThat said, I loved this smart and quirky tale set on the day before Christmas Eve. It follows three lonely souls (and a dog with wanderlust) through the streets of Philadelphia. There's Madeleine, the feisty nine-year-old who can really sing; Sarina, the teacher with love troubles; and Lorca, the owner of the Cat's Pajamas jazz club. All three eventually meet up \u2014 like instruments in a spectacular finale \u2014 at the club's closing time.\n\nPerfect for fans of Jennifer Egan, Karen Russell and anyone else seeking a fresh take on the magic that surrounds the season.", "article_metadata": {"RATING": "GENERAL", "DESCRIPTION": "Laura Knudsen is the digital services librarian at the Idea Exchange in Cambridge.
