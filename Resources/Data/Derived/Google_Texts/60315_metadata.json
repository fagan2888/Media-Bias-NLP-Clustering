(AP) \u2014 Finally, a trip to the Kentucky Derby winner\u2019s circle for Ahmed Zayat.\n\nAfter three disappointing runner-up finishes, the owner won his first Derby when favorite American Pharoah took the Run for the Roses on Saturday before at record crowd of 170,513 at Churchill Downs.\n\nThe owner from Egypt who lives in New Jersey celebrated with his trainer Bob Baffert and jockey Victor Espinoza, both of whom are well acquainted with winning the Derby.

The owner also had Mr. Z, who finished 13th, and El Kabeir, scratched on Friday with a foot issue.\n\nThough American Pharoah\u2019s one-length victory over Firing Line was the closest of a six-race career in which he had been rarely tested, he proved he could answer a challenge.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Owner Ahmed Zayat finally gets his Kentucky Derby victory", "title": "Owner Ahmed Zayat finally gets his Kentucky Derby victory", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Owner Ahmed Zayat finally gets his Kentucky Derby victory", "title": "Owner Ahmed Zayat finally gets his Kentucky Derby victory", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/03/owner_ahmed_zayat_finally_gets_his_kentucky_derby_victory/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/kentucky-derby-horse-racing.jpeg18-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Owner Ahmed Zayat finally gets his Kentucky Derby victory", "title": "Owner Ahmed Zayat finally gets his Kentucky Derby victory", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/kentucky-derby-horse-racing.jpeg18-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Gary B.
