The biggest change for most taxpayers is on Line 61 of Form 1040: a box to check if you have health insurance and a tax to pay if you don\u2019t. Millions who received insurance through Obamacare\u2019s exchanges will have a more complicated set of calculations to complete.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be tons of questions and confusion and uncertainty and complexity,\u201d said Kathy Pickering, executive director of the Tax Institute, the research and analysis division of H&R Block Inc. \u201cWe still have a lot of questions.\u201d\n\nThe added strain on taxpayers will increase burdens on the Internal Revenue Service at its busiest time of the year. The IRS is already warning that about half the people who call its toll-free phone lines won\u2019t be able to get through.\n\n\u201cUse our phone lines only as a last resort,\u201d IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said Thursday. Taxpayers who receive information from the IRS web site, he told reporters in Washington, will be making a \u201ccontribution to the public good\u201d by letting others get through on the phone.\n\n\u2018Hard Year\u2019\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s never happened before, it\u2019s a learning experience for everybody,\u201d said Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center, a Washington research group. \u201cThis will be the hard year. Next year will be easier. Five years down the road, nobody will remember this was anything strange.\u201d\n\nThe tax agency also says it will complete fewer audits this year because of a smaller enforcement staff.\n\nCongress passed Obamacare in 2010 to expand health-insurance coverage, and the law relies on the tax system for two important functions.\n\nFirst, the IRS polices the requirement that individuals have health insurance, which can be satisfied with an employer-provided plan, a government program such as Medicaid or insurance purchased on the exchanges established under the law.\n\nFailure to have health insurance in 2014 generates a penalty of $95 per person or 1 percent of household income, whichever is greater. Those thresholds will increase to $325 and 2 percent for 2015.\n\nMajor Intersection\n\nThe second major intersection between Obamacare and the tax system applies to about 8 million people who purchased policies through the exchanges. About 85 percent of the people who initially enrolled received subsidies, which went directly to insurance companies during 2014.\n\nThose subsidies were typically based on 2012 income and now must be reconciled with the taxpayers\u2019 actual 2014 income and household size. Some taxpayers will owe the government money, with caps on the amount they have to repay. Others will get money back.\n\nBoth the individual mandate and the subsidies present complications for tax filing.\n\nOne issue with the mandate is that workers won\u2019t get statements from employers that say whether their insurance met the law\u2019s requirements for minimum coverage. The IRS delayed that requirement until the 2016 tax filing year, and the lack of information will limit the government\u2019s ability to enforce the law.\n\nHealth Law\n\nKoskinen said the IRS would enforce the health law like any other part of the tax code. Some people who get audited randomly or for other reasons will be asked to provide documents to verify that they had health insurance.\n\nThe other complication is figuring out whether any of the exemptions to the penalty apply. They include the unavailability of affordable coverage, membership in a religious sect with objections to insurance, or a long list of circumstances under which the government can issue a hardship exemption, such as domestic violence and homelessness.\n\nThe subsidies affect substantially fewer people than the mandate -- and could be trickier to navigate.\n\nPeople who didn\u2019t update their family status and income during 2014 will have particular difficulty. A bonus or a move to a higher-paying job could cause some to owe the government money that they never actually received -- because it was sent straight to the insurance company.\n\n\u2018Absolutely\u2019 Blindsided\n\n\u201cPeople are going to absolutely be blindsided,\u201d said Steve Mankowski, a partner at EP Caine & Associates in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, who is chairman of the National Conference of CPA Practitioners\u2019 tax-policy committee. \u201cIt can take someone from getting a refund to owing money.\u201d\n\nKoskinen said taxpayers who received subsidies should wait to file their returns until they have gotten information from the exchanges on Form 1095-A.\n\nOne plus for taxpayers is that the IRS doesn\u2019t have some of its usual tools to enforce the law. Congress prohibited the tax agency from using liens and levies to make people pay the individual mandate. The IRS can still reduce refunds.\n\nThe IRS is also going to be shorthanded this year, which will mean less customer service and less enforcement.\n\nThe administration says the Obamacare changes shouldn\u2019t complicate things for most taxpayers and is directing people to the IRS and Health and Human Services websites for information.\n\n\u201cFor the vast majority of Americans, tax filing under the Affordable Care Act will be as simple as checking a box to show they had health coverage all year,\u201d Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew said in a statement. \u201cWe are working to ensure that whatever their experience, consumers can easily access clear information since this is the first year they will see certain changes to their tax returns.\u201d\n\nBudget Cuts\n\nThe IRS budget is $10.9 billion this year, down 3 percent from last year and 12 percent below what the administration requested.\n\nThe tax agency also must continue working on a problem it has struggled with for several years -- criminals who steal others\u2019 refunds through identity theft.\n\nThat\u2019s especially an issue early in the tax season, when criminals can file tax returns and get refunds before legitimate taxpayers even know what happened.\n\nThe IRS has taken steps to address identity fraud, including on the number of refunds that can be sent to a single bank account or prepaid debit card.\n\n\u201cThey have a much better handle on it, but it is still a problem,\u201d said Edward Karl, vice president for taxes at the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Richard Rubin", "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare is about to collide with the U.S. tax-filing season, adding frustration for millions of taxpayers trying to figure out how to comply and how much they will owe the government.", "title": "Have Obamacare?
