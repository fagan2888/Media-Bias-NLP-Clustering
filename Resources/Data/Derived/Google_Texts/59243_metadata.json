It was no different upon Ike Davis\u2019s arrival, even though he had come from a tumultuous situation with the Mets.\n\nDavis, after slumping for more than a year, had lost his job as first baseman to Lucas Duda. He was bombarded with questions regarding his future, though he had little control over it. At times it appeared that Davis had lost his confidence, and he was certainly unhappy about having to be a bench player.\n\nIn those first few moments in the Pirates clubhouse, Hurdle simply sought to reassure Davis that he would play a pivotal role on his new team.\n\n\u201cDown the road, we\u2019ll get to where you\u2019ve been,\u201d Hurdle recalled telling Davis. \u201cI just want to let you know where you are and who we are. And we\u2019re happy to have you. I think you\u2019re going to add value in everything we do.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to learn everyone\u2019s name overnight. Just bite off little pieces. You\u2019re here to play. Try to find a reset button.\u201d\n\nDavis\u2019s career has been reset indeed with the April 18 trade to the Pirates. In 23 games with Pittsburgh before his return to New York for a weekend series with the Yankees, Davis had a .286 batting average and a .797 on-base plus slugging percentage. Last year, the worst of his career, Davis hit just .205 with a .661 O.P.S., and with the Mets this year, his batting average in 12 games was 208.\n\nPhoto\n\nSince Davis\u2019s trade, in which the Mets got Zack Thornton, a minor league relief pitcher, Duda has a .237 average and a .655 O.P.S. For now, it appears that the Mets may have traded the wrong first baseman.\n\n\u201cYou guys are putting too much emphasis on the Mets,\u201d Davis told reporters before Saturday\u2019s game. \u201cI had a great couple years, but I don\u2019t hate them. They\u2019re not really in my focus anymore. I had a great time, I made great friendships, but I\u2019m on the Pirates and there\u2019s not a hatred toward the Mets of, like, vengeance. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m happy where I\u2019m at. I had a great time with the Mets and I\u2019m not with them anymore. I\u2019m not going to do anything weird to the Mets. I\u2019m just going to go play.\u201d\n\nUpon joining the Pirates, Davis was presented with some scouting information that the team had compiled about him. So far, that information seems to have helped Davis correct his approach. Davis has also been liberated from the high-pressure New York environment. During one stretch with the Pirates, Davis went hitless for 22 consecutive plate appearances but did not have to address the situation with reporters. Davis joked that in New York there would have been a graphic about his hitless streak in one of the tabloids.\n\n\u201cThat happens all the time,\u201d Davis said of slumps. \u201cIt\u2019s just when you have to talk about your bad streaks every day, you can think about it more than you want to.\u201d\n\nIn that first talk with Hurdle, Davis learned that the team was happy to have him and would give him playing time. He no longer had to worry about having to prove himself with each at-bat.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s nice to play for someone that actually wants you or thinks that you can help the team,\u201d Davis said. \u201cObviously the Mets thought I could help the team for a couple years, \u2019cause I was there for almost five. I had one bad season, and they had to make a change. And they traded me away.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know what else to say about that. It\u2019s nice to be with a team that likes you. I don\u2019t think the Mets hated me, until, you know. ...\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "feature", "ptime": 20140517171119, "twitter": {"description": "In 23 games with Pittsburgh before his return to New York for a weekend series with the Yankees, Ike Davis had a .286 batting average and a .797 on-base plus slugging percentage.", "title": "Ike Davis Flourishes With Pirates", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/sports/baseball/after-trade-to-pittsburgh-a-former-met-finds-a-career-renaissance.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002886975"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/18/sports/SUB-IKE/SUB-IKE-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/sports/baseball/after-trade-to-pittsburgh-a-former-met-finds-a-career-renaissance.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002886975", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/sports/baseball/after-trade-to-pittsburgh-a-former-met-finds-a-career-renaissance.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "sports/baseball", "hdl_p": "Traded to Pittsburgh, a Former Met Finds a Career Renaissance", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/baseball/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 17, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"section": "Baseball", "modified": "2014-05-22", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/sports/baseball/index.jsonp", "tag": "Duda, Lucas", "published": "2014-05-17", "section-taxonomy-id": "DE2B278B-2783-4506-AAD5-C15A5BB6DA1A"}, "keywords": "Baseball,Trades (Sports),New York Mets,Pittsburgh Pirates,Davis  Ike,Duda  Lucas", "description": "In 23 games with Pittsburgh before his return to New York for a weekend series with the Yankees, Ike Davis had a .286 batting average and a .797 on-base plus slugging percentage.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Jorge Arangure Jr.", "SCG": "baseball", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Duda, Lucas", "slug": "18ike", "byl": "By JORGE ARANGURE Jr.", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "In 23 games with Pittsburgh before his return to New York for a weekend series with the Yankees, Ike Davis had a .286 batting average and a .797 on-base plus slugging percentage.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/18/sports/SUB-IKE/SUB-IKE-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "Baseball", "CG": "sports", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "May 17, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Pittsburgh Pirates", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140522150006, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/18/sports/baseball/after-trade-to-pittsburgh-a-former-met-finds-a-career-renaissance.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/18/sports/SUB-IKE/SUB-IKE-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "In 23 games with Pittsburgh before his return to New York for a weekend series with the Yankees, Ike Davis had a .286 batting average and a .797 on-base plus slugging percentage.", "title": "Ike Davis Flourishes With Pirates"}, "pdate": 20140517, "des": "Trades (Sports)", "articleid": 100000002886975, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Ike Davis Flourishes With Pirates", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/18/sports/SUB-IKE/SUB-IKE-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8403\"", "article_summary": "During one stretch with the Pirates, Davis went hitless for 22 consecutive plate appearances but did not have to address the situation with reporters.\n\u201cYou guys are putting too much emphasis on the Mets,\u201d Davis told reporters before Saturday\u2019s game.\nI\u2019m just going to go play.\u201dUpon joining the Pirates, Davis was presented with some scouting information that the team had compiled about him.\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s nice to play for someone that actually wants you or thinks that you can help the team,\u201d Davis said.\nIn those first few moments in the Pirates clubhouse, Hurdle simply sought to reassure Davis that he would play a pivotal role on his new team."}
