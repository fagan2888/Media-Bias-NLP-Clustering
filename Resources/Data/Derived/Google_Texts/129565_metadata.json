Earlier, Chloe Morrison, a World Vision emergency communications officer, said Vanuatu\u2019s disaster response office told her agency that at least eight people died. She had also heard reports of entire villages being destroyed in more remote areas.\n\nThe confusion over the death count is largely due to a near-total communications blackout across the country. With power lines and phone circuits down, officials in the capital had no way of knowing what the scope of the damage was on the outer islands, where the storm scored a direct hit.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to communicate outside Port Vila,\u201d Malatu said. \u201cAt this point, the damage is severe and we haven\u2019t had figures of how many houses destroyed. \u2026 It\u2019s really bad, it\u2019s really bad.\u201d\n\nOfficials were planning to head to the outer islands in helicopters, small planes and military aircraft on Monday to get a better sense of the destruction, Malatu said.\n\nThe government declared a state of emergency across the country and Australia and New Zealand sent in relief supplies. The damaged airport was closed for commercial flights, but the first delivery of supplies arrived Sunday from the Red Cross, Malatu said.\n\n\u201cPeople are really upset and it\u2019s really hard, just because for the last couple of years, we haven\u2019t received a really big cyclone like this one,\u201d said Isso Nihmei, Vanuatu coordinator for the environmental and crisis response group 350. \u201cMost people right now, they are really homeless.\u201d\n\nHe came upon one of the storm\u2019s victims on Saturday, while surveying the damage along the coastline with other relief workers. The group spotted a man lying on the ground, not breathing, and rushed him to the hospital. By the time they arrived, however, he was dead, Nihmei said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vanuatu struggles to account for cyclone damage, deaths", "title": "Vanuatu struggles to account for cyclone damage, deaths", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Vanuatu struggles to account for cyclone damage, deaths", "title": "Vanuatu struggles to account for cyclone damage, deaths", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/15/vanuatu_struggles_to_account_for_cyclone_damage_deaths/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/vanuatu-cyclone-pam.jpeg7-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vanuatu struggles to account for cyclone damage, deaths", "title": "Vanuatu struggles to account for cyclone damage, deaths", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/vanuatu-cyclone-pam.jpeg7-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Nick Perry", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd48d2\"", "article_summary": "Packing winds of 270 kilometers (168 miles) per hour, Cyclone Pam tore through Vanuatu early Saturday, leaving a trail of destruction and unconfirmed reports of dozens of deaths.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to communicate outside Port Vila,\u201d Malatu said.\n\u201cAt this point, the damage is severe and we haven\u2019t had figures of how many houses destroyed.\nPaolo Malatu, coordinator for the National Disaster Management Office, said two people were confirmed dead in the capital, Port Vila, with another 20 injured.\nThe government declared a state of emergency across the country and Australia and New Zealand sent in relief supplies."}
