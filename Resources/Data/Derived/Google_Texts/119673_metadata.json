Claiming that President Obama has deviated from \"the America our Founding Fathers created,\" his column expressed nostalgia for a time when Republican President Ronald Reagan spoke freely about Christian values during a Christmas speech in 1981:\n\nLet us never forget that there was once a time in the U.S. when people and even presidents weren't afraid to stand for traditional values and encourage others to do the same. Case in point, President Ronald Reagan, in his 1981 Christmas address, televised and on the radio from the Oval Office for the entire nation and world to hear, said: \"At this special time of year, we all renew our sense of wonder in recalling the story of the first Christmas in Bethlehem, nearly 2,000 years ago. Some celebrate Christmas as the birthday of a great and good philosopher and teacher. Others of us believe in the divinity of the child born in Bethlehem, that he was and is the promised Prince of Peace. ... Like the shepherds and wise men of that first Christmas, we Americans have always tried to follow a higher light, a star, if you will. At lonely campfire vigils along the frontier, in the darkest days of the Great Depression, through war and peace, the twin beacons of faith and freedom have brightened the American sky. At times, our footsteps may have faltered, but trusting in God's help, we've never lost our way. ... So let this holiday season be for us a time of rededication. ... Tonight, in millions of American homes, the glow of the Christmas tree is a reflection of the love (of) Jesus. ... Christmas means so much because of one special child.\"\n\nThe hosts of Fox & Friends parroted Norris' column saying \"Chuck Norris' point was, remember the time when American presidents weren't afraid to talk about traditional values, as Ronald Reagan did back in 1981,\" and used the opportunity to highlight a clip of Reagan's speech.\n\nBut Norris and Fox's nostalgia omitted the current president's frequent expressions of his Christian faith. Earlier in 2014, President Obama's Easter address contained the following comments about the suffering of Jesus Christ:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Media Matters for America", "description": "In an effort to push Fox News' favorite narrative that Christmas is under attack, the network turned to former television star Chuck Norris and former President Ronald Reagan as ammunition for its latest attempt to&nbsp;attack President Obama&nbsp;by casting doubt on his dedication to Christian values and wrongly suggesting he&nbsp;has not spoken", "title": "Fox Turns To Chuck Norris, Ronald Reagan To Invent Latest Attack On Christmas", "url": "http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/11/19/fox-turns-to-chuck-norris-ronald-reagan-to-inve/201628", "image": "http://cloudfront.mediamatters.org/static/uploader/image/2014/11/19/f&f-chucknorris.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-19T09:24:42-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/11/19/fox-turns-to-chuck-norris-ronald-reagan-to-inve/201628", "title": "Fox Turns To Chuck Norris, Ronald Reagan To Invent Latest Attack On Christmas", "site": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}, "card": "summary", "creator": {"identifier": "@mmfa", "id": 13493302}}, "fb": {"admins": 1092360128}, "article": {"section": "Blog", "tag": "War on Christmas", "published_time": "2014-11-19T09:24:42-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-19T08:48:40-05:00", "author": "http://mediamatters.org/authors/brian-powell/143"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec16\"", "article_summary": "\"We haven't even hit Thanksgiving, and already the war on Christmas is underway,\" wrote Norris.\nBut Norris and Fox's nostalgia omitted the current president's frequent expressions of his Christian faith.\n...
