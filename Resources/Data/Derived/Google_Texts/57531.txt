Broncos left guard Evan Mathis, who has an ankle injury, is listed as questionable for Sunday night’s game against New England

Mathis was able to practice Friday for the first time this week.

“It’s a game-time decision with Evan,” Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said. “We’ll work him out before the game.”

Mathis sustained the injury in the fourth quarter of the Broncos’ 17-15 win over the Bears this past Sunday. Rookie Max Garcia will make his first career start if Mathis is unable to play.

“I have a lot of confidence in Max,” Kubiak said.

Receiver Emmanuel Sanders, who has had ankle and finger injuries, is listed as probable for Sunday, a good sign that he’ll be able to play. Sanders missed the Chicago game with what he called a high ankle sprain.

As expected, quarterback Peyton Manning and linebacker DeMarcus Ware were officially ruled out of Sunday’s game. Kubiak said it hasn’t been decided whether Manning will watch the game from the coaches’ press box or on the sidelines Sunday, but he will be at the game.

Ware said Thursday he did not expect to play.
