The area concerned, believed to be the size of Cyberjaya, is said to have come under a larger 16,896-hectare area designated by Pahang as an industrial timber plantation since 2012.\n\n\u201cIt has been categorised as a \u2018degraded\u2019 forest. Altogether, the Lesong PRF stands at 52,464 hectares,\u201d said S M Mohamed Idris, the President of SAM.\n\nHe referred to a news report last Thursday that said the Pahang Forestry Department had reasoned that since a third of the Lesong PRF was deemed to contain poor quality timber, \u201ca decision was made by the Pahang state government to convert part of Lesong that is poor in standing volume composition into commercial timber plantations.\u201d\n\nIdris said, \u201cA plantation is not a forest. There is no such thing as a \u2018forest plantation\u2019. It is therefore scientifically, statistically and ecologically misleading to allow plantations to remain within a gazetted PRF.\u201d\n\nHe noted that the National Forestry Act 1984 indicated a sustainability objective for timber production forests.\n\nHe asked how it was possible for parts of the Lesong PRF to be degraded if it had been sustainably managed.\n\nHe said the report seemed to point to an abundance of harvested logs from the area.\n\n\u201dHow can the logged forest be considered degraded when the estimated value of timber from it is RM150 million?,\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201dThus, if it is still highly profitable to log the forest concerned, why can\u2019t its conservation and sustainable management be affordable too?\n\n\u201cThis is an important matter, considering the proximity of the Lesong PRF to the Endau Rompin National Park.\n\n\u201dWe call on the Pahang authorities to stop the logging and undertake rehabilitation of the \u2018degraded\u2019 forest.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "GEORGE TOWN: Sahabat Alam Malaysia (SAM) has condemned the decision of the Pahang government to permit forest conversion activities to take place within th...", "og": {"site_name": "Free Malaysia Today", "description": "3,000 hectares of the Lesong Permanent Reserve Forest are being cleared to make way for a timber plantation.", "title": "Is sustainable forestry a farce?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/logging1.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-28T20:07:50+00:00", "url": "http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2014/09/28/is-sustainable-forestry-a-farce/", "type": "article"}, "robots": "index,follow", "fb": {"admins": "100000828073580,100004018701425,100007776888339,100005652107376", "app_id": 170260162989134}, "keywords": "Endau Rompin,forest,Lesong,Pahang,Top News,", "article": {"section": "Nation", "published_time": "2014-09-28T20:07:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-28T20:07:50+00:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2dca\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is an important matter, considering the proximity of the Lesong PRF to the Endau Rompin National Park.\nHe asked how it was possible for parts of the Lesong PRF to be degraded if it had been sustainably managed.\n\u201dWe call on the Pahang authorities to stop the logging and undertake rehabilitation of the \u2018degraded\u2019 forest.\u201d\nAltogether, the Lesong PRF stands at 52,464 hectares,\u201d said S M Mohamed Idris, the President of SAM.\n3,000 hectares of the Lesong Permanent Reserve Forest are being cleared to make way for a timber plantation."}
