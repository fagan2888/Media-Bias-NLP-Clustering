Photos by Chris Keane/Reuters, Brian Snyder/Reuters.\n\nDonald Trump is a nativist demogogue who attacks racial and religious minorities and heaps praise on authoritarian leaders abroad. He borrows from white nationalists and channels the worst impulses in American life. He\u2019s an opportunist with little connection to the Republican Party or the conservative movement.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nIf he has a serious rival for the GOP presidential nomination, it\u2019s Ted Cruz, the caustic senator from Texas. Cruz is a genuine ideologue, with deep support in the \u201ccounter-establishment\u201d of conservative activists and right-wing billionaires. But he\u2019s also been a commissar of sorts in the GOP, blasting fellow Republicans for any deviation\u2014real or perceived\u2014from orthodoxy and leading the party in an almost self-destructive charge against the Affordable Care Act and the Obama administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTrump is vulgar, but singular\u2014he stands for no one but himself. Cruz, however, represents a faction of the GOP with real enemies in the party. And if he wins, he brings that faction to power.\n\nWhich means that in official Washington\u2014where Cruz is a pariah\u2014the choice is easy. \u201cI\u2019ve come around a little bit on Trump,\u201d said Sen. Orrin Hatch in an interview with CNN. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure we\u2019d lose if he\u2019s our nominee because he\u2019s appealing to people who a lot of the Republican candidates have not appealed to in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can live with Trump,\u201d said one Republican lobbyist to the New York Times. \u201cDo they all love Trump? No. But there\u2019s a feeling that he is not going to layer over the party or install his own person. Whereas Cruz will have his own people there.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can coach Donald. If he got nominated he\u2019d be scared to death,\u201c explained Charles Black, a former GOP operative, to the Times. \u201dThat\u2019s the point he would call people in the party and say, \u2018I just want to talk to you.\u2019 \u201d John Feehery, a former Republican congressional aide, put it simply. \u201cTrump won\u2019t do long-lasting damage to the GOP coalition,\u201d he said to the Times. \u201cCruz will.\u201d\n\nTrump is vulgar, but singular. Cruz, however, represents a faction of the GOP with real enemies in the party.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs professional Republican pundits, operatives, and lawmakers, these figures care about the health of the party and their place in it. They want to win, and they want to preserve their influence. Trump appears malleable. Win or lose, they see themselves as safe. Cruz, on the other hand, is a threat. An unapologetic ideologue, Cruz isn\u2019t interested in outreach to the other side. Instead, he believes he can win by generating a wave of conservative enthusiasm. If Americans tend to punish naked extremism at the ballot box, then Cruz could cost the GOP the White House in a close election. And worse, as Feehery suggests, he could damage the party in Senate and congressional races. But beyond winning or losing, an ascendant Cruz brings a new class of conservative activists to Washington, who might displace the present establishment. In that sense, Cruz is an existential threat.\n\nBut the mood is different among conservative intellectuals. For them, Trump\u2014who escews conservatism in favor of an aggressive ethno-nationalism\u2014is the existential threat. It\u2019s why, on Thursday, National Review published a symposium titled \u201cAgainst Trump,\u201d where a cross-section of conservative writers and personalities made the case against the Donald for a conservative audience. Whether or not it\u2019s effective\u2014how many Trump supporters read and heed National Review?\u2014it\u2019s an important signal from another set of party elites.\n\nAt the same time, it\u2019s a flawed one. To defeat an enemy, you have to understand him, and it\u2019s not clear that any of the writers in National Review\u2019s symposium understand Trump or the forces in their party and movement that sustain him. More than anything, they attacked him for his ideology, or lack thereof. \u201cTrump is no conservative\u2014he\u2019s simply playing one in the primaries,\u201d wrote Mona Charen. \u201c[V]irtually every Republican presenting himself to voters swears so-help-me-God that he is a conservative,\u201d wrote Brent Bozell, \u201cMany of these politicians are calculating, cynical charlatans. \u2026 Trump might be the greatest charlatan of them all.\u201d\n\nUnder all of this is the assumption that Republican voters are conservatives first, driven by conservative principles. And to an extent, that\u2019s true. But it\u2019s self-serving to ignore, or deny, the extent to which Republican voters have been mobilized and organized by the politics of white backlash, and the degree to which conservative organs like National Review have been active participants in the process. The classic example is William F. Buckley\u2019s infamous 1957 editorial, \u201cWhy the South Must Prevail,\u201d where the National Review founder and premier conservative intellectual made the case against the civil rights movement. \u201cThe central question that emerges,\u201d writes Buckley, \u201cis whether the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail, politically and culturally, in areas in which it does not predominate numerically. The sobering answer is Yes\u2014the White community is so entitled because, for the time being, it is the advanced race.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhite backlash politics informed Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 campaign (where he lifted George Wallace\u2019s rhetoric, wholesale), Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980 campaign (where he called the Voting Rights Act \u201chumiliating to the South\u201d), and George H.W. Bush\u2019s 1988 bid for the presidency (see: \u201cWillie Horton\u201d). In recent years, they\u2019ve fueled the career of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, herself elevated to the national stage by prominent conservative intellectuals. Indeed, from affect to appeal, Palin is an important antecedent to Trump.\n\nWhich gets to the irony of this apparent divide in the Republican Party elite, between those who might back Trump and those who disdain him. Conservative intellectuals\u2014in terminal denial over the role of race in their movement\u2014can\u2019t see how Trump flows naturally from undercurrents and strategies in conservative politics and conservative rhetoric. The white backlash to liberal identity politics helped build the modern Republican Party, and now\u2014in its most virulent form\u2014it is consuming its host.\n\nRepublican officeholders and operatives, by contrast, are far more clear-eyed. As crafters and practitioners, they see Trump as a malleable force, using rhetoric that isn\u2019t too far from their own. If harnessing an aggressive white backlash is what it takes to win, so be it. And if Trump proves too alienating, then they can disavow him. Or at least, that\u2019s what they hope.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "The real estate magnate seems malleable while the Texas senator poses an existential threat.", "fb-share": "The real estate magnate seems malleable while the Texas senator poses an existential threat.", "sailthru.author": "Jamelle Bouie", "description": "Donald Trump is a nativist demogogue who attacks racial and religious minorities and heaps praise on authoritarian leaders abroad.
