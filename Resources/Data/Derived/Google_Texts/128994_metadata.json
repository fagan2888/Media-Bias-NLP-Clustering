Many investors gathered there were still working through their financial models for the Chinese e-commerce company.\n\nThe updated prospectus and new numbers raised new questions. Some of them were answered by founder and executive chairman Jack Ma and several senior executives who fielded questions before a crowd of what many estimated at more than 1,000 people. Some questions remain.\n\nHere\u2019s what investors there learned:\n\nFounder and executive chairman Jack Ma\u2019s focus:\n\nTwo attendees who requested anonymity said Mr. Ma said that one of his main areas of focus would be on the company\u2019s relationship with the Chinese government.\n\nAlibaba has clearly handled the government\u2019s role in corporate policy deftly, one person said, but Mr. Ma\u2019s description of his role shows the potential problems that could loom if Alibaba ever falls on the wrong side of government policy.\n\nIn July, a commission advising Congress on U.S.-China economic issues raised questions about the ownership structure of Chinese companies that allow Chinese companies to get around the country\u2019s restrictions on foreign ownership.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s key pitch to investors:\n\nGrowth. Several attendees said that Alibaba\u2019s executive team and its bankers stressed the e-commerce company\u2019s potential for massive growth in its user base. \u201cEveryone is salivating over the potential for Chinese users,\u201d said Ilya Grozovsky, senior research analyst at SPQR Capital. \u201cThe numbers for Alibaba are so big that they dwarf every other company we know. But the company highlighted how little e-commerce goes on in relation to the overall population.\u201d\n\nAlibaba\u2019s narrative \u2014 a love story with small business:\n\nIn its prospectus and during Monday\u2019s presentation, Alibaba has highlighted the company\u2019s usefulness to small businesses and entrepreneurs in China. One investor said that Mr. Ma has clearly positioned himself as the hero to small business, touting how Alibaba has helped companies grow and expand in China.\n\nW. Fifield Whitman, chief investment officer at John Locke Capital Management L.P., said that\u2019s \u201cexactly what the [Chinese] government wants to hear.\u201d Mr. Whitman said he doesn\u2019t doubt the veracity of such statements but also said it\u2019s a smart way for Alibaba to position the company to get the Chinese government\u2019s full support. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good way to get everyone to gloss over potential problems if they arise,\u201d he said, noting the potential for fraud among its user base or possible issues with the Internet in China, including potential government blocks on content.\n\nAlibaba\u2019s Time Frame:\n\n102 years. Mr. Ma often speaks about Alibaba\u2019s long-term plans. Some investors wondered whether that long-term focus could hurt returns in the near-term for investors with a shorter investing horizon.\n\nWhat should investors know about Alibaba\u2019s decision to separate Alipay, the division which processes its payments, from the broader company in 2011?\n\n\n\nAlibaba\u2019s decision to spin-off Alipay, which is an online payment processor often seen as similar to PayPal, has been one of the most controversial in the company\u2019s history. The unit was one of the most profitable parts of the business.\n\nStill investors have looming questions on this front and the ones we spoke with were largely unsatisfied with Mr. Ma\u2019s responses to questions on this topic. Mr. Ma called the decision one of the toughest in his career and basically said that investors will eventually understand why he did it without elaborating further.\n\nWhy does Alibaba have such an unusual partnership structure?\n\nAlibaba\u2019s management structure is another source of confusion and potential contention. A group of 27 partners\u2014comprised of company managers and executives of affiliates\u2014can nominate a majority of Alibaba\u2019s board, which gives the group effective control of the company.\n\nSeveral investors said that Mr. Ma danced around this question without really answering it.\n\nAlibaba did attempt to showcase its management team beyond Mr. Ma by having four other executives on stage responding to questions.\n\nWill Alibaba expand internationally?\n\nYes, but it\u2019s not a key area of focus, company executives said according to one attendee. Executives said Alibaba is still largely focused on China, where just half of people use the Internet and only of half of those users shop online.\n\nHow robust will demand be?\n\nSeveral investors in attendance said the Alibaba IPO had one of the largest audiences they\u2019d ever seen at a roadshow. Not everyone there had plans to buy, as some people were simply there to understand the story.\n\nStill, the company\u2019s IPO is expected to see significant demand from investors. One investor in attendance said he was relieved to see that Alibaba expects to price at at least $60. The investor said that price point will discourage retail investors and short-term traders from participating as it\u2019s easier to take a position with a stock below $20. That price point will keep some of the \u201cnoise\u201d away that was there for Facebook\u2019s IPO.\n\nTelis Demos and Matt Jarzemsky contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Alibaba Group Holdings Ltd. kicked off its 10-day roadshow at the Waldorf Astoria in New York Monday ahead of its initial public offering.
