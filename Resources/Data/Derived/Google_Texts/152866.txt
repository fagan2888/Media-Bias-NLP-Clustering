C-SPAN3’s American History TV will air the “Bad Acts, Bad Paper” Panel from the Nation to Nation Symposium on October 11 at 2 p.m.

The symposium was webcast and recorded at the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, D.C. on September 18. It celebrates the opening of the landmark exhibition, “Nation to Nation: Treaties Between the United States and American Indian Nations,” and the book of the same title that accompanies the exhibition.

The American History TV website says the panel “talks about the successes and failures of land treaties between tribes and the United States. They discuss the impact of non-ratified treaties, how Navajo women played a role by refusing to relocate to Oklahoma Indian Territory, and Supreme Court Justice John Marshall’s legal legacy regarding native property rights.”

In case you miss it on C-SPAN3 this weekend, the symposium is also available on YouTube. Here is the first portion of the “Bad Acts, Bad Papers” panel.
