And I tear up when I hear the do wop, dooby doo do wop background vocals to the ballad \u201cTelephone Line,\u201d because my brain is connected to my body and I\u2019m not a fucking monster. But I have never truly embraced ELO., who are currently having a moment thanks to the release of their first album of new material in a decade and a half, \u201cAlone in the Universe\u201d (credited to Jeff Lynne\u2019s ELO) and a few key TV appearances including the Grammy Awards, Jimmy Fallon\u2019s \u201cTonight Show\u201d and \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live.\u201d\n\nPart of my trouble with the band is Mr. Lynne himself. I like to look a man in the eye before I play air guitar to his towering riffs like that on \u201cMa-Ma-Ma Belle,\u201d and the guy (who is sighted) has not removed his sunglasses in public in 40 years. There\u2019s also a beard issue. Lynne\u2019s persona is so un-rock \u2018n\u2019 roll that he makes Dave Stewart of Eurythmics look like Darby Crash. In the \u201970s, ELO\u2019s colorful logo was inescapable, but it always reminded me of Milton Bradley\u2019s remedial computerized \u201cgame\u201d Simon.\n\nMy father, a gambling man, once had a stake in a horse called \u201cStrange Magic,\u201d after another ballad which appears in Sofia Coppola\u2019s \u201cThe Virgin Suicides\u201d (although maybe Dad merely posed in the winner\u2019s circle with the horse, as he used to like to do that). AM and FM radio were saturated with ELO hits. \u201cTurn to Stone,\u201d \u201cSweet Talkin\u2019 Woman,\u201d and \u201cRockaria!\u201d\u2014 an aria\u2026 made of rock! You just couldn\u2019t get them out of your head.\n\nIn the \u201980s and early \u201990s, while ELO went into something of a false hiatus (they still ruled radio, only now it was the \u201cclassic rock\u201d format), Lynne gained a reputation for taking once nitty gritty guitar playing singer-songwriters like George Harrison and Tom Petty and making their records sound like they were recorded at the bottom of a wet Heinz beans can \u2026 and backed by ELO. People bought these records by the multi-millions. Lynne was also the second Traveling Wilbury to never remove those fucking shades (it\u2019s amazing Ian Hunter wasn\u2019t in that band).\n\nNow before you roll up your sleeves, I\u2019m not saying ELO were charmless or even pretentious (the whole O thing with the strings and the classical gas). I am confessing that I simply chose to resist them (I even had a very beautiful woman re-enact most of \u201cXanadu\u201d in my apartment, to my utter lack of interest, but that could be my antidepressants in action). However, there\u2019s a difference between resistance and escape, and there ain\u2019t no escaping Mr. Beardo Shades. These days, it feels like I\u2019m the only one who even wants to try.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeff Lynne is back with ELO's first album of new material in almost 15 years, but the old stuff will not die", "title": "We\u2019ve never had a break from ELO: Do ya really need to hear this song, ever again?", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Jeff Lynne is back with ELO's first album of new material in almost 15 years, but the old stuff will not die", "title": "We\u2019ve never had a break from ELO: Do ya really need to hear this song, ever again?", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/11/27/weve_never_had_a_break_from_elo_do_ya_really_need_to_hear_this_song_ever_again/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/elo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jeff Lynne is back with ELO's first album of new material in almost 15 years, but the old stuff will not die", "title": "We\u2019ve never had a break from ELO: Do ya really need to hear this song, ever again?", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/11/elo.jpg", "creator": "@marcspitz", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Marc Spitz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Do Ya, Electric Light Orchestra, elo, Jeff Lynne, Movies, Mr Blue Sky, Music, soundtracks", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd29b5\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Do Ya, Electric Light Orchestra, elo, Jeff Lynne, Movies, Mr Blue Sky, Music, soundtracks, Entertainment NewsI have the Electric Light Orchestra on my iPod because\u2026 I own an iPod.\nHowever, there\u2019s a difference between resistance and escape, and there ain\u2019t no escaping Mr. Beardo Shades.\nLynne was also the second Traveling Wilbury to never remove those fucking shades (it\u2019s amazing Ian Hunter wasn\u2019t in that band).\nIn the \u201970s, ELO\u2019s colorful logo was inescapable, but it always reminded me of Milton Bradley\u2019s remedial computerized \u201cgame\u201d Simon.\nNow before you roll up your sleeves, I\u2019m not saying ELO were charmless or even pretentious (the whole O thing with the strings and the classical gas)."}
