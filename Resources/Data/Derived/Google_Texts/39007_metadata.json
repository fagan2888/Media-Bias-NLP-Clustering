You haven\u2019t seen presidents brag a lot in the text of proclamations about what they\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nAlthough Obamacare has been most prominently featured in proclamations, other legislation or administration programs also have been given presidential plugs.\n\nLate last month, Mr. Obama again declared January as National Stalking Awareness Month and used a proclamation to highlight the fact that he signed into law the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act.\n\nEarlier in December, he celebrated the nation\u2019s aviation pioneers on Wright Brothers Day and used the occasion to tout his administration\u2019s efforts to improve science and engineering education efforts, including the Race to the Top initiative.\n\nIn August, Mr. Obama issued a proclamation recognizing September as National Wilderness Month and used the order to note that he had established five national monuments and, in his first year in office, designated more than 2 million acres of wilderness.\n\n\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve noticed primarily with President Obama,\u201d Mr. Rottinghaus said of the trend.\n\nBeyond the routine\n\nAlthough the White House has injected pointed politics into the proclamations on multiple occasions, the vast majority of Mr. Obama\u2019s proclamations remain routine. Like presidents before him, Mr. Obama normally uses proclamations to mark national holidays or other annual recognitions such as National Mentoring Month.\n\nThe first proclamation in American history was used for such a purpose. On Oct. 3, 1789, President Washington marked the first Day of National Thanksgiving. The nation\u2019s first president, in the course of his two terms, issued more than a dozen other proclamations, including one establishing the District of Columbia.\n\nPresidents of both parties have used proclamations to conduct more substantive business.\n\nIn 2005, President George W. Bush used a proclamation to suspend certain prevailing-wage requirements in order to expedite federal aid to areas ravaged by Hurricane Katrina.\n\nMr. Obama used proclamations to halt deportations of some illegal immigrants. He also used them to pay tribute to former presidents or lawmakers who passed away, and issued one to honor victims of the Dec. 14, 2012, massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.\n\nWhich observances a president chooses to mark and what groups he chooses to honor, while not carrying much legal weight, still are important and can bring into focus a commander in chief\u2019s beliefs, said William Howell, a politics professor at the University of Chicago who has written extensively on presidential power.\n\nEstablishing values\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of proclamations are largely symbolic in nature. They don\u2019t have clear policy content, but that isn\u2019t to say that they lack political relevance,\u201d Mr. Howell said. \u201cThey matter a good deal. It isn\u2019t just puffery. There are stakes involved in this, and not just for the president himself.\u201d\n\nIndeed, interest groups and those devoted to specific causes see great value in proclamations, mainly because such orders make crystal clear \u2014 to supporters, opponents and potential donors \u2014 that they have an ally in the White House.\n\nSometimes, the decision to issue a proclamation \u2014 or not to issue one \u2014 can carry its own pointed political message.\n\nFollowing the example set by President Clinton, President Obama regularly has marked LGBT Pride Month through presidential proclamations. Mr. Bush did not. In fact, he went in the opposite direction.\n\nIn October 2003, he marked Marriage Protection Week and declared in a proclamation that \u201cmarriage is a union between a man and a woman.\u201d\n\nWhen used in such a manner, proclamations help administrations target subsets of the American population and send specific messages, Mr. Rottinghaus said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one more kind of micro-targeting to reinforce the message that they\u2019ve done something for these groups,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama has broken new ground by using the traditionally bland, apolitical proclamations as a public relations tools.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama has broken new ground by using the traditionally bland, apolitical proclamations as a public relations tools.", "title": "Obama mixes commemorative proclamations and presidential plugs", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/14/obama-mixes-commemorative-proclamations-and-presid/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/14/1_142014_ap1574419737808201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/14/1_142014_ap1574419737808201.jpg", "description": "President Obama has broken new ground by using the traditionally bland, apolitical proclamations as a public relations tools.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama mixes commemorative proclamations and presidential plugs"}, "Author": "Ben Wolfgang", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Michelle Obama, Brandon Rottinghaus"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc512\"", "article_summary": "Following the example set by President Clinton, President Obama regularly has marked LGBT Pride Month through presidential proclamations.\nMr. Obama used proclamations to halt deportations of some illegal immigrants.\n\u201cThis is something I\u2019ve noticed primarily with President Obama,\u201d Mr. Rottinghaus said of the trend.\nLike presidents before him, Mr. Obama normally uses proclamations to mark national holidays or other annual recognitions such as National Mentoring Month.\nMr. Obama increasingly has used presidential proclamations to tout his accomplishments, to draw attention to initiatives such as first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Move\u201d campaign and to make the case for programs such as Obamacare."}
