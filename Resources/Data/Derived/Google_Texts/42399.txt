CLEVELAND, Ohio -- The deadline is about one month away ... and this could be shaping up to be a messy tax season, particularly for last-minute filers.

Previously, citing budget constraints, the IRS warned taxpayers this year that it will probably be able to answer only about half of the calls it gets from taxpayers looking for help.

At the same time, new requirements required by the Affordable Care Act could create extra filing work for tax preparers, making it more difficult to get help at the last minute.

If you've already filed your taxes, what's been the most frustrating part for you this year? Let us know in the below poll.
