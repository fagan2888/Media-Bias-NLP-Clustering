Israel’s Holocaust memorial on Sunday commemorated the 75th anniversary of Kristallnacht, “The Night of Broken Glass,” when Nazi forces terrorized and torched Jewish towns and neighborhoods in Germany and parts of Austria, killing 500 Jews.

Hundreds of survivors, World War II veterans, Israel Defense Forces soldiers and high school students gathered at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Center to hear survivor accounts of Kristallnacht, Israel’s Arutz Sheva reported.

Hanita Rudney, a Kristallnacht survivor, told the audience of the time she discovered her father’s store had been destroyed.

“My brother took my hand the next day and took me to school. On the way we saw my father’s destroyed store. Everything was broken, and they had written ‘Juden’ (German for ‘Jew’) all over. It was heartbreaking,” she said.

Some 500 Jews were killed in the attacks on Nov. 9 and 10, 1938. More than 30,000 were arrested and sent to concentration camps, more than 1,000 synagogues were burned down, and 7,000 Jewish businesses were destroyed or damaged, Arutz Sheva reported.
