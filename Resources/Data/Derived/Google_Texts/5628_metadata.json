AppNexus is also in discussions to raise up to an additional $40 million from other investors, it said.\n\nAccording to CEO Brian O\u2019Kelley, AppNexus did not necessarily require further investment, having raised $75 million in January 2013. The company continued to receive interest from a range of potential investors, however, and decided it was \u201ca good time\u201d to raise additional capital anyway.\n\n\u201cNow we have the money and the scaled business to go and make the impact on the industry we really want,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Kelley said. \u201cWe can go out acquire companies; we can hire people, but the truth is we can now be more impactful and bold about changing how this industry works,\u201d he added.\n\nThe additional funding also means AppNexus is under less pressure to raise capital through the public markets. In the past two years a handful of online advertising companies have held initial public offerings of their own, but have subsequently performed poorly. Programmatic ad network Rocket Fuel has seen its stock price dip 73% since January, for example. YuMe is off 38%; Tremor Video, 46%; and Millennial Media, 66%. Rubicon Project is down 27% from its $15 initial-public-offering price in April. (WSJ owner News Corp has a 13.7% stake in Rubicon).\n\nMr. O\u2019Kelley said AppNexus is no rush to follow in their footsteps with an IPO of its own. \u201cIt\u2019s possible next year,\u201d he said, but added that he sees little incentive to go public other than liquidity for investors and employees.\n\n\u201cI suspect we will go the IPO direction, but I\u2019d like to do it when it\u2019s right for us and when it\u2019s right for the market,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Mr. O\u2019Kelley some public investors have been \u201cburned\u201d by some of the online advertising IPOs of the past two years, in part because investors don\u2019t fully understand the companies they\u2019re investing in, or the broader online ad market. As a result, he wants AppNexus to go public when investors understand more about what it does and where it fits into the complicated online ad ecosystem.\n\n\u201cCompanies have gone public saying they\u2019re ad technology companies, and then it\u2019s become clear they\u2019re actually high-growth, high-margin ad networks, and investors feel their expectations haven\u2019t been met,\u201d he argued.\n\nMr. O\u2019Kelley suggested some private investors have pushed for IPOs simply to enable them to recoup their investments.\n\n\u201cI think there are private companies whose investors come to board meetings and want to push for an outcome while the market is hot, but our investors want us to really have the most impact we can,\u201d he said.\n\nSeparately, Mr. O\u2019Kelley pointed to AppNexus\u2019s most recent funding as evidence that successful technology companies can be built in New York as opposed to California.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really tired of people saying you can\u2019t build a real technology company in New York,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe\u2019ve proved that you can.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Ad technology company AppNexus has accepted a $60 million investment from a Boston-based public equity and asset management firm, it announced Monday.", "title": "AppNexus Raises Another $60 Million", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/08/18/appnexus-raises-another-60-million/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "AppNexus Raises Another $60 Million", "description": "Ad technology company AppNexus has accepted a $60 million investment from a Boston-based public equity and asset management firm, it announced Monday.", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Jack Marshall", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "CMO Today Blog", "page.subsection": "CMO Today", "article.summary": "Ad technology company AppNexus has accepted a $60 million investment from a Boston-based public equity and asset management firm, it announced Monday.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-08-18T16:07:19-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-160", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/08/18/appnexus-raises-another-60-million/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-269B-1409", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "CSuite", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Ad technology company AppNexus has accepted a $60 million investment from a Boston-based public equity and asset management firm, it announced Monday.", "title": "AppNexus Raises Another $60 Million", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/08/18/appnexus-raises-another-60-million/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "CMO Today", "article.id": "BL-269B-1409", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-08-18T16:22:47-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc97eb\"", "article_summary": "Ad technology company AppNexus has accepted a $60 million investment from a Boston-based public equity and asset management firm, it announced Monday.\nAccording to CEO Brian O\u2019Kelley, AppNexus did not necessarily require further investment, having raised $75 million in January 2013.\nAppNexus is also in discussions to raise up to an additional $40 million from other investors, it said.\n\u201cI\u2019m really tired of people saying you can\u2019t build a real technology company in New York,\u201d he concluded.\nMr. O\u2019Kelley said AppNexus is no rush to follow in their footsteps with an IPO of its own."}
