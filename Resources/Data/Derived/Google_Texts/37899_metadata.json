Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) on Sunday said President Barack Obama is emulating one of the worst traits of GOP President Teddy Roosevelt \u2014 his disregard for the Constitution.\n\nGrassley tweeted late Sunday night that Obama \u201cconsiders the Constitution a nuisance.\u201d While Grassley wasn\u2019t more specific, many Republicans have complained about Obama\u2019s various unilateral decisions to amend and delay Obamacare, change immigration rules, and even engage in military action without considering Congress.\n\nWhen Pres Obama says I hv pen and ph if Congress won't I will he's like the Roosevelts he considers Constitution a nuisance \u2014 ChuckGrassley (@ChuckGrassley) September 15, 2014\n\nGrassley\u2019s comparison between Obama and Roosevelt was apparently prompted by the Sunday broadcast of the first installment of Ken Burns\u2019 new documentary, \u201cThe Roosevelts,\u201d on PBS. The documentary has prompted a new wave of interest in Roosevelt, and has led to some press reports noting Roosevelt\u2019s view that the president has broad authority to operate, an argument Republicans have rejected in light of Obama\u2019s use of executive power.\n\n\u201cOne century later Theodore Roosevelt says government can do anything that is not specifically prohibited in the Constitution,\u201d said scholar Clay Jenkinson, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \u201cHe believed government had to be more central, energetic and assertive than the Constitution had envisioned it or we could not go on as a nation.\u201d\n\nThe White House website says Roosevelt, a Republican, believed the president was a \u201csteward of the people\u201d and should take \u201cwhatever action necessary for the public good unless expressly forbidden by law or the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not usurp power, but I did greatly broaden the use of executive power,\u201d Roosevelt once wrote, according to the White House.\n\nObama himself has gone out of his way to emulate certain aspects of Roosevelt, who made a lasting mark in history by fighting corporate monopolies, and championing, labor rights and higher taxes on \u201cbig fortunes\u201d in order to help average Americans. Roosevelt delivered his \u201cNew Nationalism\u201d speech in Osawatomie, Kansas in 1910, which laid out many of these ideas, and Obama tried to emulate that speech in his own set of remarks in Osawatomie in 2011.\n\n\u201cNow, for this, Roosevelt was called a radical,\u201d Obama said of Roosevelt\u2019s prescription for America. \u201cHe was called a socialist, even a communist. But today, we are a richer nation and a stronger democracy because of what he fought for in his last campaign: an eight-hour work day and a minimum wage for women, insurance for the unemployed and for the elderly and those with disabilities, political reform, and a progressive income tax.\u201d\n\nGrassley\u2019s complaint about Obama\u2019s abuse of the Constitution has been a central theme of Republicans for the last few years. House Republicans have already approved a resolution allowing the House to file a civil lawsuit against the White House for its selective implementation of Obamacare.\n\nThis very week, Congress will resume its debate over whether and how it should authorize the Obama administration to provide equipment and training for moderate Syrians. While the White House has said it would welcome this authorization, it has also said it\u2019s not needed, and does not plan to offer specific language.\n\nThat goes against House Republicans\u2019 expectations that the White House should put forward an authorization request.\n\nThe Obama administration has also said it plans to create some form of protected status for several million illegal immigrants, an action Republicans have said would clearly violate immigration laws as passed by Congress. Many Republicans say that move would be Obama\u2019s most overt act against Congress and the Constitution, and even many Democrats have warned against taking this step before the mid-term elections \u2014 Obama has since said he would take some step after November.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Sen.
