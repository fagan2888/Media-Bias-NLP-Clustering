So the guy who can get to 51, we think he\u2019s a smart guy. So all the people who like naked power plays will think this is a pretty cute thing he did today. And everyone will reverse their position on a dime like Obama did. But in the end, it\u2019s, you can be too clever for your own good. This is how Obamacare became law, because of procedural trickery because Ted Kennedy had died, so it means there was a vacancy in the Senate, you couldn\u2019t go back and correct and amend the Senate version of the bill because they were a senator short.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were going to, do you remember when they were talking about deeming it to have passed? Deeming it,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou know, and because of that procedural trickery, millions and millions of people across America have lost their health insurance, and thousands of other suckers who think they\u2019ve enrolled in Obamacare, and think they have some new form of health insurance, because it doesn\u2019t accept any payment processing on the stupid website, are going to go to the pharmacy or the emergency room on January 7 or 8, and discover that in fact, they don\u2019t have medical insurance.\n\nSteyn called Obama a \u201cbringer of chaos\u201d because he had pushed the Obamacare law through, only to try to undo some of the key parts of it, which would be problematic for insurance providers and its customers.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that the president is a man of low cunning,\u201d Steyn said. \u201cSo when he said I\u2019ve waved my magic and all the policies I cancelled are now un-cancelled, he well knew, he well understood that in the end, that was a call that was going to be made by state commissioners and Blue Cross/Blue Shield, and all the rest of them. And having had, having given them three years to bring the policies they offered into compliance with the health commissar\u2019s bureau of compliance, they then switch on the TV and discover that Obama is now giving them ten minutes to de-comply all those plans. I mean, realistically, what we\u2019re talking about here is January 1 \u2014 January 1, which means that under most, under the usual paperwork processing of American life, people have got to have checks in the mail for these plans on December 15. And what this means is that there\u2019s going to be chaos. I mean, this is Obama, the bringer of chaos. And as I said, it goes back to ramming, I said at the time he was basically hammering this law through the teeth of the American people and down their throat against what all the polls said and through procedural trickery. And it has brought chaos. He is the bringer of chaos.\u201d\n\nThe National Review columnist said much of this brought on the American people is because of the myth about the Kennedys and Camelot. That mythology, he said, changed the Democratic Party for the worse.\n\n\u201c[I]f you look at, Jim Pearson wrote a great book on Camelot, by the way, that in effect, transformed the Democratic Party,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not a believer in Kennedy myths or anything, but the biggest victim of Kennedy mythology was the Democratic Party. They were transformed from a reasonably sane party into believers in punitive liberalism. And Obamacare is the greatest act of punitive liberalism the Democratic Party has forced on the American people.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Poor", "description": "National Review columnist says Kennedy mythology transformed the Democratic Party \u2018reasonably sane party into believers in punitive liberalism\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "On Hugh Hewitt\u2019s radio show earlier this week, National Review columnist Mark Steyn talked about Obamacare and the long-term impact it will have beyond its plagued initial rollout.
