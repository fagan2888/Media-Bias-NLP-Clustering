Murthy and his sister used to cut their father\u2019s cigarettes in half to try to force him to stop.\n\nMurthy was one of a few health officials who shared personal stories around smoking at Gateway Community College Thursday morning on a panel discussion about the history and impact of federal anti-smoking messaging. The discussion happened two days after the federal Food and Drug Administration decided to stop the distribution of four tobacco products, because they did not meet public health requirements.\n\nAccording to the Center for Disease Control, 17.8 percent of U.S. adults smoke cigarettes, meaning around 42.1 million individuals.\n\nMurthy said most people, like his father, smoke because of an emotional attachment to the habit rather than intellectual arguments for it. To really change people\u2019s actions, officials should focus on determining why people, especially in vulnerable populations, smoke and how to provide them with resources to stop, he said.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t make reasoned decisions about the pros and cons,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of what we\u2019re trying to shift is culture.\u201d\n\nHe listed three challenges in getting people to quit: people\u2019s lack of belief that they have control of their own health, the national focus on treatment rather than prevention, and \u201cthe myth that the battle against big tobacco has been won.\u201d The tobacco industry has recently made the most profit\n\nState Medicaid Director Kate McEvoy said smoking is also a personal issue for her\u2014both sets of her grandparents died in their mid-60s from tobacco-related illnesses. Her parents, who did not smoke, have outlived them by more than 15 years, she said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has catalyzed states to cover a broader ranger of tobacco cessation services, she said, \u201cmeeting people where they are\u201d in the process of quitting.\n\nThe city has been working on a multi-step plan to make New Haven tobacco-free by raising awareness about the harms of smoking, helping smokers quit and keeping kids from starting.\n\nIn May, the Board of Alders passed an ordinance outlawing tobacco products\u2014including e-cigarettes\u2014from government buildings, playgrounds, sports fields, school grounds and Lighthouse Park. The city can restrict smokers to specific spaces within those public areas.\n\nThis year, Southern Connecticut State University and the University of New Haven have declared their campuses smoke-free. Gateway was the first community college to make its campus smoke-free, including e-cigarettes, in 2012.\n\nThe FDA is also looking at how to regulate e-cigarettes, Murthy said. Teachers have asked him how to stop students from smoking them in class, since there are few local or school policies to regulate the product.\n\nThough the data are murky on whether e-cigarettes are useful tools for quitting smoking, kids who have never used tobacco should not be using e-cigarettes, he said.\n\nState public health Commissioner Jewel Mullen said grassroots and community mobilization could be a faster tool for regulating e-cigarettes than waiting for state leaders to pass laws. That mobilization could be the \u201ccommunity version of taking a pair of scissors and cutting a cigarette,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt will take more than just money to counter what the tobacco industry can do,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Paul Bass, New Haven, Connecticut, New Haven Connecticut, CT, New Haven news, news about New Haven, Toni Harp", "og": {"site_name": "New Haven Independent", "description": "U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy\u2019s father smoked despite being a doctor.
