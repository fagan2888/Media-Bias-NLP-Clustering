Kennedy International Airport can look forward to a new luxury terminal that will handle the more than 70,000 animals flying in and out every year.\n\nThe ARK at JFK, its name inspired by Noah\u2019s biblical vessel, will more than measure up to terminals for humans: Horses and cows will occupy sleek, climate-controlled stalls with showers, and doggies will lounge in hotel suites featuring flat-screen TVs. A special space for penguins will allow them mating privacy.\n\nThe ARK is billed as the world\u2019s first air terminal for animals.\n\nSet to open next year, the $48 million, 178,000-square-foot shelter and quarantine facility will take in every kind of animal imaginable \u2014 even an occasional sloth or aardvark. From here, they\u2019ll head to barns, cages, racetracks, shows and competition venues in the United States and abroad.\n\nMany arriving animals are quarantined for a period of time (for horses, it\u2019s normally about three days) to make sure they\u2019re not carrying contagious diseases. And The ARK is designed to make their stay as pleasant as possible, with hay-lined stalls for up to 70 horses and 180 head of cattle, plus an aviary and holding pens for goats, pigs and sheep.\n\nFor dog owners, The ARK will offer a 20,000-square-foot luxury \u201cresort\u201d run by the company Paradise 4 Paws, complete with bone-shaped splashing pools, massage therapy and \u201cpawdicures with colored nail pawlish.\u201d Dogs can watch flat-screen TVs and their owners can check in on them via webcam.\n\nCats will have their own trees to climb. And all animals will have access to a 24-hour clinic run by Cornell University\u2019s veterinary college.\n\nEven animals that don\u2019t need to be quarantined \u2014 a huge dog that can\u2019t fit in the cabin and has to travel as cargo, for example \u2014 will be held at the facility until departure or pickup by its owner.\n\n\u201cA lot of our design making is in collaboration with veterinarians and consultants to help minimize the amount of stress placed on the animal,\u201d said Cliff Bollmann, a leading airport architect working on The ARK for the San Francisco-based architecture firm Gensler.\n\nKennedy receives the bulk of animals entering the United States, but there are similar facilities near airports in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and San Juan. Until Kennedy\u2019s ARK opens, animals in transit will continue to be handled at the airport\u2019s aging 10,000-foot Vetport, built in the 1950s.", "article_metadata": {"description": "NYC\u2019s Kennedy airport building luxury animal terminal", "title": "NYC\u2019s Kennedy airport building luxury animal terminal", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "NYC\u2019s Kennedy airport building luxury animal terminal", "title": "NYC\u2019s Kennedy airport building luxury animal terminal", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/07/19/nycs_kennedy_airport_building_luxury_animal_terminal/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/nyc-airport-animal-house.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NYC\u2019s Kennedy airport building luxury animal terminal", "title": "NYC\u2019s Kennedy airport building luxury animal terminal", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/07/nyc-airport-animal-house.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Verena Dobnik", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3fd0\"", "article_summary": "From here, they\u2019ll head to barns, cages, racetracks, shows and competition venues in the United States and abroad.\nKennedy receives the bulk of animals entering the United States, but there are similar facilities near airports in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and San Juan.\nUntil Kennedy\u2019s ARK opens, animals in transit will continue to be handled at the airport\u2019s aging 10,000-foot Vetport, built in the 1950s.\nThe ARK is billed as the world\u2019s first air terminal for animals.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jet-setting stallions and high-flying hounds at New York\u2019s John F.
