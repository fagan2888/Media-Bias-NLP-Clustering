We\u2019ll be able to guide our own health care decisions in a way that will make us healthy.\u201d\n\nYesterday, campaigning in New Hampshire, the Florida Republican returned to the same subject\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the verge of a revolution in this regard, where we\u2019ll be able to know all sorts of things with, you know, devices like this. I got beat up by the left because I showed my, you know, Apple Phone \u2013 this device will have the ability to measure your sugar content, to measure your heartbeat, to measure whether you\u2019re taking your drugs in the proper way. And you\u2019ll be able to wirelessly send text messages to your health care provider or to your loved one, or whatever, so that you can get back on track.\u201d\n\nIt seems the former governor isn\u2019t entirely clear on why he \u201cgot beat up.\u201d\n\nThe point isn\u2019t that wearable tech is irrelevant (he said \u201cphone\u201d yesterday, but I assume he meant \u201cwatch\u201d). It\u2019s easy to imagine devices that can help people manage chronic conditions like diabetes. Indeed, the Florida Republican makes it sound as if these advancements are on the horizon, but in many instances, the technology already exists.\n\nThat\u2019s not the problem. Rather, the area of concern is that Bush intends to scrap the Affordable Care Act , which would eliminate health security for millions of families, and he included a wrist gadget as part of his vision for a replacement system. Sarah Kliff added last week:\n\nBush endorses the idea of \u201csomeone\u201d sending him a signal on his Apple Watch when his blood sugar is low. I like that idea, too! It would help diabetic patients, like Bush, better manage their care. But here\u2019s the challenge: there is not some army of benevolent people out there monitoring blood sugar. There are health-care providers who do this, and to get signed up for their blood sugar monitoring programs, you typically need health insurance. In this way, the type of consumer-powered health market that Bush describes is one that relies on Americans having access to health services \u2013 and using that access to make better decisions about their health care.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Bush didn't get \"beat up\" because he pointed to his fancy gizmo; he got \"beat up\" because he pointed to his fancy gizmo while making the case against the ACA.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/jeb-once-again-turns-his-apple-watch", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "Bush didn't get \"beat up\" because he pointed to his fancy gizmo; he got \"beat up\" because he pointed to his fancy gizmo while making the case against the ACA.", "title": "Jeb once again turns to his Apple Watch", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/jeb-once-again-turns-his-apple-watch", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/rtx1du48_copy.jpg?itok=6h7caM_h", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/jeb-once-again-turns-his-apple-watch", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/rtx1du48_copy.jpg?itok=xDy4EA_D", "height": 553}, "title": "Jeb once again turns to his Apple Watch", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Bush didn't get \"beat up\" because he pointed to his fancy gizmo; he got \"beat up\" because he pointed to his fancy gizmo while making the case against the ACA."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2015-05-22T11:31:00-04:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "tags": "election-2016,elections,health,health-care-reform,jeb-bush,rachel-maddow-show", "title": "Jeb once again turns to his Apple Watch", "published": 1, "date": "05/22/2015 11:31:00 EDT", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/jeb-once-again-turns-his-apple-watch"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "Bush didn't get \"beat up\" because he pointed to his fancy gizmo; he got \"beat up\" because he pointed to his fancy gizmo while making the case against the ACA.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Election 2016, Elections, Health Care Reform, Health, Jeb Bush"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccf03\"", "article_summary": "Sarah Kliff added last week:Bush endorses the idea of \u201csomeone\u201d sending him a signal on his Apple Watch when his blood sugar is low.\nBut here\u2019s the challenge: there is not some army of benevolent people out there monitoring blood sugar.\nThere are health-care providers who do this, and to get signed up for their blood sugar monitoring programs, you typically need health insurance.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have the ability, someone will, you know, because of my blood sugar, there\u2019ll be a wireless, there\u2019ll be, someone will send me a signal\u2026.\nJeb Bush caused a bit of a stir last week, telling an audience that he intends to destroy the Affordable Care Act, replacing it with a \u201cconsumer-driven\u201d system, part of which includes his new Apple Watch."}
