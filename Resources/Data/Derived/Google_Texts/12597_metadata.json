In the new article, Piketty tries to guide people toward his tome\u2019s stronger points and away from its weaknesses, which include his cavalier use and abuse of data.\n\nPiketty reiterates, for example, that the rise of labor inequality in the U.S. has very little to do with his central thesis, which is that when the interest rate (\u201cr\u201d) is greater than the growth rate (\u201cg\u201d), wealth inequality rises.\n\nSections II and IV of Piketty\u2019s article say that simple versions of economic models do not support the claims he made in \u201cCapital.\u201d He argues\u2014without using enough math to be falsifiable\u2014that the addition of some tweaks could make the models give the results he desires. He does not say that in his book he used simple versions of the models.\n\nOne important failure in Piketty\u2019s book was that it relied on substitutability between capital and labor that is far beyond the range supported by data. In a 2014 paper, Brent Neiman and Loukas Karabarbounis offered a defense of high substitutability (though not necessarily as high as Piketty suggests it is), based on an economy with multiple sectors. In his new article, Piketty borrows their idea, which was not available when he wrote his book. Of the approach used throughout \u201cCapital,\u201d Piketty now writes that it is \u201cnot [his] favored interpretation of the evidence.\u201d\n\nIn other ways, Piketty remains consistent. His argument for why the inequality \u201cr > g\u201d should increase wealth inequality is tweaked in Section II but still has a central flaw: He does not deal with the fact that \u201cr\u201d and probably \u201cg\u201d are outputs of the same economic processes that create wealth.\n\nBut even the predictive value of that famous inequality goes under the revisionist\u2019s knife:\n\nPiketty in 2015: \u201cI do not view \u2018r >\u2019 gas the only or even the primary tool for considering changes in income and wealth in the twentieth century, or for forecasting the path of inequality in the twenty-first century.\u201d (Page 1)\n\nPiketty in 2014: \u201c[T]here is every reason to believe that \u2018r\u2019 will be much greater than \u2018g\u2019 in the decades ahead . . . clearly all the ingredients are in place for the top centile and thousandth of the global wealth distribution to pull farther and farther ahead of the rest.\u201d (Page 463)\n\n\u201cCapital in the Twenty-First Century\u201d contained a lot of 19th- and 20th-century history, which Piketty now says was his primary topic. But the book also made strong claims about the future. If Piketty had wanted readers to take his predictions and policy recommendations less seriously, perhaps his book title should not have included the words \u201cTwenty-First Century.\u201d\n\nOriginally published in The Wall Street Journal", "article_metadata": {"description": "Thomas Piketty is trying to cover his retreat with an article.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Thomas Piketty is trying to cover his retreat with an article.", "title": "The Liberal Economist Who Stirred Inequality Debate Is Backtracking", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/piketty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-03-13T14:49:13+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xde1Jc"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Thomas Piketty is trying to cover his retreat with an article.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/piketty.jpg"}, "title": "The Liberal Economist Who Stirred Inequality Debate Is Backtracking", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "Thomas Piketty", "published_time": "2015-03-14T03:01:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-13T14:49:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Thomas Piketty, Capital in the Twenty-First Century, capital, labor, book"}, "article_summary": "Of the approach used throughout \u201cCapital,\u201d Piketty now writes that it is \u201cnot [his] favored interpretation of the evidence.\u201dIn other ways, Piketty remains consistent.\nIn the new article, Piketty tries to guide people toward his tome\u2019s stronger points and away from its weaknesses, which include his cavalier use and abuse of data.\nIn his new article, Piketty borrows their idea, which was not available when he wrote his book.\nHis argument for why the inequality \u201cr > g\u201d should increase wealth inequality is tweaked in Section II but still has a central flaw: He does not deal with the fact that \u201cr\u201d and probably \u201cg\u201d are outputs of the same economic processes that create wealth.\nPiketty reiterates, for example, that the rise of labor inequality in the U.S. has very little to do with his central thesis, which is that when the interest rate (\u201cr\u201d) is greater than the growth rate (\u201cg\u201d), wealth inequality rises."}
