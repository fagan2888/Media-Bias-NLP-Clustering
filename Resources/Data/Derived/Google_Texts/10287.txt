Two Oklahoma cowboys hope the third time is a charm in their race around the world. The Amazing Race starts a new season Sunday, and it's bringing back some of the stars from past seasons which includes brothers Cord and Jet McCoy.

They'll race for $1 million.

"I think I'm ready for Phil to say, 'Go,' and pull our hats down and run for it," said one of the brothers. "It's been three years since we went last time, and we got a little taste of success. We're ready to come back for more."

The brothers have come in second and sixth in their first two races. The new season begins at 7 p.m. Sunday on News On 6.
