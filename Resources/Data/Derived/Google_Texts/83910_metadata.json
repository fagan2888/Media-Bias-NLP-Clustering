The manager says everything was back to normal at the store by 2 p.m. Monday.\n\nHy-Vee on Minnesota Avenue also had to clear out its coolers and shelves because of the power outage.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "A power outage that lasted more than six hours affected more than 8,000 customers in Sioux Falls Monday morning.
