Or is there another solution? \u2022 \u0093Some of our wells are reaching historic lows\u0094\n\nby Eric Miller, North Valley CorrespondentCHICONovember 23, 2014 9:01pmYou can\u0092t manage what you don\u0092t measure.\n\nMy first car, a 1970 Ford Maverick, was reliable whenever it had gas. The odometer worked but the speedometer and fuel gauge didn\u0092t. It supposedly had a 20-gallon tank. My dad warned me to fill it every 300 miles. I\u0092d recharge the tank with a few gallons whenever I had spare change. I once ran out of gas during a date, which was followed by an awkward conversation I had with her father. I should have kept better records. My self-imposed tragedy stemmed from a lack of common sense.\n\nCalifornia faces a possible fourth consecutive year of drought. The El Nino we await projects to be as wimpy as the Oakland Raider offense. The Raiders can fire coaches or trade players, like water managers can transfer surface water between basins, but we mere humans can\u0092t make it rain. Ah, but groundwater, stored in our underground bank account, is our back-up plan. The problem though is that groundwater basins, like my Maverick\u0092s gas tank, have finite capacities. And we\u0092re not exactly sure where we are on the fill gauge.\n\nAccording to the University of California Cooperative Extension Service, nearly 57,000 wells provide groundwater for agricultural and domestic uses in the five northern Central Valley counties of Shasta, Tehama, Glenn, Butte and Colusa. Lake Shasta, the headwaters of the Central Valley Project, stores Sacramento River water, which flows south past Tehama, Glenn, Butte and Colusa Counties before reaching the Delta.\n\nThe region hosts nearly two million irrigable acres including pasture, orchard and row crops, and rice. Cities like Red Bluff, Corning, Orland, and Willows, all just an exit ramp off Interstate 5, use groundwater. East of I-5 and between the Sacramento River and the western Sierra foothills sits Chico, where its nearly 100,000 residents also rely on groundwater.\n\n\u0093Declining groundwater levels in foothill domestic wells and in older wells located outside urban areas concern us,\u0094 says Paul Gosselin, director of the Butte County Department of Water and Resource Conservation. Butte County monitors spring and fall groundwater levels. \u0093Domestic wells built in the 1970\u0092s and earlier are typically shallower than younger wells built in the 1980\u0092s and later,\u0094 he says.\n\nAdds Butte County Environmental Health Director Brad Banner, \u0093We\u0092ve seen a lot of well repairs and deepenings, where pumps are lowered to reach water levels.\u0094\n\nChico\u0092s crown jewel, Bidwell Park, a popular recreation area for hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding, is not immune to drought impacts.\n\n\u0093At the Five Mile Recreation Area we\u0092ve struggled with a localized drought problem,\u0094 says Park and Natural Resource Manager Dan Efseaff.\n\nBig Chico Creek, habitat for salmon and steelhead, flows through the Five Mile Area. The creek supports a usually lush riparian forest and local groundwater. Chico\u0092s municipal system provides drinking water at picnic sites, but a shallow well provides water for toilets and irrigation.\n\n\u0093We had to lower the well 40 feet this summer,\u0094 says Mr. Efseaff. \u0093Over the past few years we\u0092ve transitioned part of the turf to native grasses, sedges, and native forest to reduce irrigation needs. We hope to reduce water needs in the park by 20 percent.\u0094 Mr. Efseaff also points to the installation of new waterless urinals in restrooms.\n\nCan Chico irrigate using Big Chico Creek? \u0093No,\u0094 says Mr. Efseaff, \u0093we don\u0092t have surface water rights. Plus we don\u0092t want to adversely affect the salmon run.\u0094\n\nThe California Water Service Company (NASDAQ: CWT), of San Jose, provides Chico\u0092s municipal supply. \u0093Some of our wells are reaching historic lows,\u0094 says Pete Bonacich, interim district manager. \u0093But many of our wells are stable. We haven\u0092t lowered pumps or deepened wells. Water conservation helps but we need rain.\u0094\n\nSeveral miles south of Chico, in the unincorporated area of Durham, falling groundwater levels concern residents. Durham is surrounded by almond and walnut orchards, permanent crops that need water year-round, not just to thrive but to simply stay alive.\n\n\u0093The state will eventually want farmers to meter pumps and to report well information,\u0094 says Ed McLaughlin, an almond grower and former Butte County Supervisor. \u0093I have no problems with that. It will help us protect ourselves.\u0094 Mr. McLaughlin laments, \u0093We\u0092re aware of land subsidence [the sinking of the land surface] in the Central Valley caused by groundwater overdraft. Every resource has a limit.\u0094\n\nLocal basin knowledge of the Northern Sacramento Valley\u0092s hydrology varies. The California Department of Water Resources-Northern Regional Office in Red Bluff has monitored and mapped the region since the 1990s. Butte County recently completed an investigation on local aquifer characteristics, boundaries, and recharge areas. West of the Sacramento River, irrigation districts drilled test wells to investigate aquifer depth and conducted pump tests to evaluate aquifer performance.\n\nThe underlying theme is that the North Valley geology is not uniform. There are confined and unconfined layers, some of them hydrologically connected and some not. \u0093The geologic system is very complex with interlaced hydrology,\u0094 says Glenn County Water Resources Coordinator Lisa Hunter.\n\nPut simply, the North Valley\u0092s geology isn\u0092t layered like a wedding cake nor is it a bathtub. Think more like a pile of spaghetti noodles with water flowing up, down, sideways or diagonally.\n\n\u0093We monitor over 260 dedicated wells,\u0094 says Debbie Spangler, an engineering geologist with DWR\u0092s Northern Regional Office. \u0093Since 2004 we\u0092ve observed groundwater elevation declines of nearly 40 feet within the intermediate aquifer [the zone between 200 and 600 feet]. Declines west of Corning and Orland are worrisome. We\u0092re evaluating subsidence data but the analysis is incomplete.\u0094\n\nGlenn County\u0092s Water Advisory Committee wrestles with community concern. \u0093Some people are drying out and blaming others,\u0094 says WAC member Larry Domenighini. \u0093Those who have issues must volunteer well information. Are well logs available? Are neighboring wells encountering similar problems? Coffee shop complaining doesn\u0092t help.\u0094\n\n\u0093Historically low groundwater levels can definitely lead to land subsidence,\u0094 says Chris Bonds, a senior engineering geologist with DWR\u0092s North Central Region Office in West Sacramento. \u0093We just don\u0092t know when or where it may happen. Land subsidence affects water flows in canals and impacts infrastructure like roads and levees. Currently, subsidence is especially problematic in the San Joaquin and Tulare Lake regions.\u0094\n\nDWR installed extensometers and wells to measure changes in groundwater and land elevations in the Sacramento Valley over twenty years ago. Eleven extensometers cover the region, ranging in depth from over 700 feet to nearly 1,100 feet.\n\n\u0093Back then, extensometers cost upwards of $250,000 per site. Without good measurement records we wouldn\u0092t know what\u0092s occurring at these locations today, and we probably wouldn\u0092t be having this conversation,\u0094 says the DWR\u0092s Mr. Bonds. \u0093Many groundwater issues experienced in California are classic examples of the \u0091Tragedy of the Commons.\u0092\u0094\n\n(About the writer: Eric Miller lives in Chico and serves on the Butte County Groundwater Technical Advisory Committee.
