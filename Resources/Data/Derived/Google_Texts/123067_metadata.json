Just last month, Turing Pharmaceuticals bought the rights to Daraprim, a 62-year old drug that is used to treat a life-threatening parasitic infection, and raised its price to $750 a tablet from $13.50.\n\nThat move made Turing the lightning rod for a comment by Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, who tweeted that she would introduce a plan today to counter such \u201cprice gouging.\u201d Her comment sent biotechnology stocks plummeting.\n\nThe unaffordability of drugs is a real and growing threat, even for people with health insurance.\n\nToday I\u2019m going to offer some tips on how to save money on your prescription drugs, whether you\u2019re insured or not.\n\nQ. I was recently diagnosed with cancer and had my first round of chemo. The nurse gave me a prescription for a generic anti-nausea medication. When my wife took it to the drug store, she was quoted a price of $900 for a 30-day supply. How is that possible?\n\nA. I wish I could answer the question from Jim Buchanan of Hemet, but I don\u2019t know why a generic anti-nausea drug would cost $900 out of pocket, even with his insurance applied to the prescription.\n\nI can say that his wife, Susan Buchanan, did the right thing when she didn\u2019t take $900 for an answer. Though \u201ctotally in shock\u201d from the quoted price, she asked what the cost of the prescription would be without applying insurance.\n\n$45.\n\nCounterintuitive? Yes. Confusing? Definitely.\n\n\u201cIn some cases, people may be better off not using their insurance,\u201d says Betsy Imholz, special projects director at Consumers Union.\n\nLesson 1: Shop smart. When you get your prescription, call multiple pharmacies and negotiate, even for generics. Neighborhood pharmacies may have more autonomy to lower prices than chain stores, Imholz says.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have insurance, however, Costco has the lowest price among chain stores on average, she says. You don\u2019t have to be a member to use its pharmacy.\n\nFinally, ask your doctor to write a prescription for a 90-day supply of drugs instead of 30 days. \u201cYou\u2019ll be avoiding copays and trips to the pharmacy,\u201d she says.\n\nLesson 2: Appeal for coverage. Let\u2019s say your doctor wants you to take a medication that\u2019s not on your plan\u2019s formulary and you\u2019re faced with paying full cost.\n\nBefore you empty your pockets, file an appeal with your insurer, which in most cases must cover medically necessary drugs that aren\u2019t on their formularies \u2013 if your condition warrants their use.\n\nIf your health plan rejects your appeal, contact your regulator and request an independent medical review, which is free.\n\nThe health plan\u2019s denial letter will specify your regulator, or try the state Department of Managed Health Care (888-466-2219 or HealthHelp.ca.gov) or the state Department of Insurance (800-927-4357 or Insurance.ca.gov).\n\nYou\u2019ll need to work with your doctor through this process to help you prove medical necessity.\n\nLesson 3: Look for financial assistance. There are a slew of programs offered by drug companies and foundations, and many websites that help you search for them. One is NeedyMeds (NeedyMeds.org), a national nonprofit that helps connect people with assistance.\n\n\u201cPharmaceutical companies give away billions of dollars in drugs every year to people in need,\u201d says NeedyMeds President Richard Sagall.\n\nFinancial help from pharmaceutical companies is generally for brand-name drugs that don\u2019t have generic equivalents. These programs have eligibility requirements based on four categories, Sagall says:\n\n\u2022 Citizenship and immigration status.\n\n\u2022 Insurance status. Some will help only those who are uninsured or have no drug coverage.\n\n\u2022 Income. Many have relatively generous thresholds that include middle-class families.\n\n\u2022 Specific illnesses. Some are disease- or diagnosis-specific.\n\nAll require some input from the doctor who prescribed the medication, Sagall says.\n\nIf you have drug coverage but can\u2019t afford your copay, there are programs that may help with that, too.\n\nOther helpful websites for financial assistance include the Partnership for Prescription Assistance (pparx.org); Patient Services Inc. (PatientServicesInc.org); and the Patient Advocate Foundation\u2019s National Financial Resource Directory (PatientAdvocate.org).\n\nYou can also reach out to disease-based organizations like the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society or the American Diabetes Association.\n\nLesson 4: Use prescription discount cards and programs. There are two types of drug discount cards. The first comes from pharmaceutical companies and generally offers discounts for a specific drug, Sagall says.\n\nThe other discounts multiple drugs and is offered by AARP, Costco, NeedyMeds and others. However, \u201cyou cannot use these in conjunction with insurance or state-federal programs such as Medicare,\u201d he says.\n\nBut don\u2019t forget the Buchanans of Hemet, who got a better deal without their insurance.\n\nLesson 5: Choose insurance with drug coverage you need. One of the best ways to limit your out-of-pocket costs is to choose the best plan for your situation. You\u2019ll have a chance to do that in your next open-enrollment period, which is fast approaching for most people.\n\nIf you have a chronic condition or take a lot of medications, avoid high-deductible plans, which include the \u201cbronze\u201d level plans sold by Covered California.\n\n\u201cIf you have to pay a little higher premium but have lower out-of-pocket costs, that\u2019s a better choice,\u201d says Liz Helms, president and CEO of the California Chronic Care Coalition.\n\nQuestions for Emily: AskEmily@usc.edu\n\nThe CHCF Center for Health Reporting partners with news organizations to cover California health policy.
