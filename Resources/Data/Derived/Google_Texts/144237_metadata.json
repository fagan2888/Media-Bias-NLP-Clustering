However, though Jan. 31 is the deadline and millions of Americans have signed up for coverage since the current enrollment period began on Nov. 1, don\u2019t expect a big rush in rural West Texas.\n\nWhile 11.2 million Americans had enrolled by the end of 2015, including 1.1 million in Texas, and in two years the state\u2019s uninsured rate has fallen from 25 percent to less than 20 percent, enrollment figures show the uninsured rate in rural areas remains almost as high as in October 2013, when marketplaces created by the ACA began offering coverage.\n\n\u201cOur association does not have any hard data, but as we talk to the rural hospitals, the sense that they continue to share with us is that any increase in the number of insured under the exchanges is very minimal,\u201d said Don McBeath, director of government relations at the Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals.\n\n\u201cThis is not an issue just in Texas, it is nationwide,\u201d said McBeath, who was Lubbock County Judge from 1991 to 1998.\n\nFewer choices, higher prices\n\nA Stanford University study released last February explained why, compared to their urban counterparts, most rural residents are not signing up for medical insurance under the ACA.\n\n\u201cSmall rural coverage regions under the Affordable Care Act have fewer insurers to choose from and higher prices relative to similar rural markets that get grouped in with larger urban markets nearby,\u201d the report states.\n\n\u201cSmall and rural regions appear to attract fewer entrants,\u201d wrote Michael J. Dickstein, an assistant professor of economics, in a policy brief for the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. \u201cInsurers also charge higher premiums to rural residents.\u201d\n\nMoreover, a study the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University and the Episcopal Health Foundation published in August found that the insured population in Texas \u201cremains primarily Hispanic, middle-aged, with low incomes and no college degree.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the profile of a growing number of rural counties in West Texas.\n\nIn Bailey, Crosby, Deaf Smith, Floyd and Parmer counties \u2014 to name a few \u2014 Hispanics are now the majority group and an average of 25 percent of them live below the poverty line of $24,250 a year for a family of four, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures.\n\n\u201cThe lowest-income families, who are likely to have worse health status, have no access to subsidies,\u201d Vivian Ho, chair in health economics at the Baker Institute and a professor of medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said in the report.\n\n\u201cThe ACA intended to give the poorest individuals Medicaid coverage, but Texas has not elected the Medicaid expansion offered by the law,\u201d Ho said.\n\nElena Marks, president and CEO of the Episcopal Health Foundation and a nonresident health policy fellow at the Baker Institute, agreed.\n\n\u201cNot surprisingly, the lowest-income adults comprise an increasingly large percentage of the uninsured, because most of them were ineligible for coverage opportunities in the marketplace,\u201d Marks wrote. \u201cThe ACA offered coverage to this group through optional Medicaid expansion, but Texas has not expanded Medicaid.\u201d\n\nRural hospitals get some help\n\nMcBeath said though the high percentage of people with no medical insurance is a major concern for rural hospitals because many of those facilities continue to struggle financially, for now medical institutions are holding their own, thanks mainly to new money for Medicaid payments the Texas Legislature approved last year.\n\nThe 84th Legislature restored $58 million of the approximately $75 million for Medicaid payments to rural hospitals the lawmakers cut in the 2011 session when they tackled a $27 billion shortfall. The restoration of most of the funding was critical because most insured patients at rural hospitals are on Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nMedicaid is the joint federal and state program that helps qualifying low income people pay for long-term medical and custodial care while Medicare is the federal insurance program for people 65 and older.\n\n\u201cIt is fair to say that rural hospitals continue to struggle,\u201d McBeath said. \u201cBut I do believe sincerely that the extra Medicaid payments that (state Rep.) Four Price took the lead in (restoring) will take the pressure off. We didn\u2019t get 100 percent, but what we got helps.\u201d\n\nPrice, an ACA critic and chairman of a House subcommittee that deals with health care funding, said though he is relieved rural hospitals are holding their own, the high percentage of uninsured patients those institutions care for is one of his top concerns.\n\n\u201cI am always concerned about the adequacy of health care in rural communities, not only maintaining what is available now but improving it for those communities as well,\u201d Price, R-Amarillo, said. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act has not been affordable.\u201d\n\nIn many states, more than half of the plans offered through the HealthCare.gov, the federal online market place, have deductibles of $3,000 or higher, a New York Times review found.\n\n\u201cHaving access to health care and having access to health insurance are two different things,\u201d Price said \u201cYou can have insurance coverage but not access and you can have access but not insurance.\u201d\n\nSome options out there\n\nRep. Garnet Coleman, who served in a now-defunct advisory group President Barack Obama created when the then-Democratic controlled Congress approved the ACA in 2010, said though he is concerned about some problems the uninsured face when trying to get coverage, people could help themselves greatly if they shop around.\n\n\u201cLook for the policies that are less expensive and have lower deductibles,\u201d Coleman, D-Houston, advised. \u201cAlso, even if somebody is re-enrolling, look for policies that are less expensive in terms of premiums and the deductible.\n\n\u201cSo, it is very important that people shop for the best price, for the lowest deductible and for the best network of hospitals, doctors and providers,\u201d Coleman stressed. \u201cThis is tough. It\u2019s a tough deal, but it is better to be safe than sorry.\n\n\u201cHaving insurance is very important because you never know what\u2019s going to happen and you need treatment.\u201d\n\nEnroll America, the nation\u2019s leading health care enrollment coalition, reminds the uninsured population that those who choose to remain uninsured could face a fine of $695 or 2.5 percent of their annual income, whichever is greater.\n\n\u201cThe good news is that financial help is available to help you pay for your plan,\u201d Enroll America said in a Jan. 1 news release. \u201cIn fact, as of September 2015, over 838,000 Texans were enrolled in coverage through the Marketplace, and 85 percent of them received financial assistance to make their monthly payments affordable.\u201d\n\nenrique.rangel@morris.com\n\n\u2022 (512) 673-7553", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Local News, Enrique Rangel", "og": {"site_name": "Lubbock Online | Lubbock Avalanche-Journal", "description": "AUSTIN - Time is running out to buy medical insurance for this year under the Affordable Care Act", "title": "Despite high rate of uninsured, rural West Texans not flocking to Obamacare", "url": "http://lubbockonline.com/local-news/2016-01-16/despite-high-rate-uninsured-rural-west-texans-not-flocking-obamacare", "image": "http://lubbockonline.com/sites/default/files/15052288.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "AUSTIN \u2014 Time is running out to buy medical insurance for this year under the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.
