It was fast. And it was either understood or misunderstood by a variety of different stakeholders and certainly the public and providers for that matter,\u201d said Sen. Joseph Vitale, D-Middlesex.\n\nHere\u2019s what we knew before the plan was announced: New Jersey has the second highest health-care costs in the nation, a point that frustrates consumers and businesses alike.\n\nSix months later, here\u2019s what we\u2019re likely to get next: A lot more disclosure about how tiered health plans are structured and, perhaps, details about other aspects of the state\u2019s health-care sector. Health insurers say they\u2019re fine with it if lawmakers want better transparency.\n\n\u201cConsumers can best utilize and are best-served by their health plan coverage when they understand it,\u201d said Wardell Sanders, president of the New Jersey Association of Health Plans. \u201cWhile these are complex, complicated products, certainly more can be done in this area.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of one of the more complicated topics currently roiling Trenton:\n\nQ: What is Omnia?\n\nHorizon Blue Cross Blue Shield unveiled its Omnia health plan last September and expects about a quarter-million enrollees in this first year. Its goals are to reduce health-care costs and adapt to changes in the health-care market caused by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHorizon offers five Omnia health plans, with varied monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs. But the big impact comes in choosing health-care providers. Consumers who go to Tier 1 hospitals and doctors pay lower copays and out-of-pocket costs. They can visit hospitals and doctors classified as Tier 2 but pay higher costs when doing so.\n\nHere are examples: A person enrolled in OMNIA Gold would pay a $10 copay to see a Tier 1 doctor but $30 for Tier 2. An outpatient surgery at a Tier 1 provider would cost $250, compared with 30 percent coinsurance after a $2,500 deductible is met at a Tier 2 provider.\n\nOmnia isn\u2019t the first tiered health plan; they\u2019ve been used in New Jersey for five years. But Horizon accounts for so much of the New Jersey market \u2013 at 3.8 million members it accounts for more than half of people with health insurance \u2013 that it will have an extensive impact on health care delivery.\n\nQ: So what\u2019s the fuss?\n\nThere has been an outcry in large part because hospitals and doctors still don\u2019t fully understand the standards Horizon used to assign health care providers to tiers.\n\nHorizon says it wasn\u2019t required to disclose its criteria. It has said that generally it chose hospitals that scored well on patient safety, quality and satisfaction, though lawmakers have said such assessments should have relied on what\u2019s called the Leapfrog Hospital Survey. Many large hospitals or chains were selected for the preferred tier.\n\nThere are 34 Tier 1 hospitals. About two-thirds of those hospitals are part of a \u201chealth alliance\u201d that receives higher reimbursements from Horizon for agreeing to change their payment model away from one that pays per service or test provided in favor of one aimed at preventive and quality care.\n\nThe 27 Tier 2 hospitals \u2013 many of them urban hospitals with a lot of patients who have Medicaid insurance or no coverage at all \u2013 say that if Omnia members shift away from them to other hospitals for the discounts, their finances will get shaky. They also say that in addition to not getting a clear answer about why they\u2019re not in the preferred tier, they weren\u2019t given a chance to take part.\n\n\u201cThey haven\u2019t been given one iota of transparency under the Omnia plan,\u201d said Sen. Raymond Lesniak (D-Union).\n\nState: OMNIA health alliance can move forward\n\nQ: Are the Tier 1 hospitals better?\n\nHorizon says the assignments aren\u2019t a judgment on a facility\u2019s quality of patient care. But that\u2019s certainly an impression left with consumers, say hospitals fearful of losing patients and lawmakers sympathetic to their plight.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see us embark on a policy that leads to quality places like Valley (Hospital) or Holy Name (Medical Center) losing patients because the patients get the impression that the care they\u2019re going to receive there, on just the impression from the terminology alone, is substandard,\u201d said Sen. Gerald Cardinale (R-Bergen). \u201cIt isn\u2019t substandard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s called gold and bronze, silver and something else, less filling/tastes great \u2013 I don\u2019t know what they use, but that should change,\u201d Vitale said.\n\nSanders said the tier terminology is commonly used in describing health plans, including by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, but that the industry would be open to discussing alternatives.\n\nHospitals appeal state approval of tiered health care group\n\nQ: What does the state say about Omnia?\n\nThe state Department of Banking & Insurance gave the plan the go-ahead last September. Last week, the Office of the Attorney General said it found no problems when it reviewed the implementation of the new health alliance of six hospital systems and a physician group. Some lawmakers want to expand that oversight to restore a role for the state Department of Health.\n\nQ: Why do lawmakers keep talking about Omnia, and what do they plan to do?\n\nLawmakers are very focused on it because it\u2019s an important issue. And just as importantly, major institutions in the state, including Catholic hospitals, have made fighting Omnia a priority.\n\nTwo committees, one in the Senate and one in the Assembly, held another round of hearings on Omnia Monday. The Assembly panel advanced a bill that would create a task force to study tiered plans. The Senate panel discussed but didn\u2019t vote on three proposals \u2013 requiring more disclosure from insurers about tier selections, more public disclosure about costs and biennial reviews by the state.\n\n\u201cThese bills are designed to benefit the consumer, to provide transparency,\u201d said Sen. Nia Gill (D-Essex).\n\nMost of the reaction among lawmakers has been allied with the Tier 2 hospitals, but not all. Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester, who has the ability as a legislative leader to decide what legislation is voted upon, sided with tiered health plans in general Monday, although also called for more transparency about how insurers assign hospitals to tiers.\n\n\u201cWe can no longer afford a health care system that rewards the number of patients who enter the hospital or doctors\u2019 office \u2013 like a sports team is rewarded for bringing fans into a stadium. The idea is to keep patients out of hospitals, not bring them in,\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nSweeney said he hopes the Legislature is able to adopt transparency reforms regarding tiered health plans by the end of June but said it should go beyond insurance companies to include physician costs and hospital profitability, including salaries of hospital executives.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://wac.450F.edgecastcdn.net/80450F/nj1015.com/files/2016/03/RS10821_166156558.jpg", "sailthru.author": "michaelsymons", "description": "Horizon's Omnia plan just beginning to be understood.
