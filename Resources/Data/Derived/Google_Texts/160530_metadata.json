(AP) \u2014 The brief, chaotic life of Bobbi Kristina Brown was never really her own.\n\nBorn and raised in the shadow of fame and litigation, shattered by the loss of her mother, Whitney Houston, Bobbi Kristina was overwhelmed by the achievements and demons of others before she could begin to figure out who she was.\n\nHer demise was the most awful inheritance of all.\n\nBobbi Kristina died on Sunday at Peachtree Christian Hospice in Duluth, Georgia, about six months after she was found face-down and unresponsive in a bathtub in the suburban Atlanta townhome she shared with Nick Gordon, the man she called her husband. She was 22 years old.\n\n\u201cBobbi Kristina Brown passed away July, 26 2015, surrounded by her family. She is finally at peace in the arms of God. We want to again thank everyone for their tremendous amount of love and support during these last few months,\u201d Kristen Foster, a representative for the Houston family said Sunday.\n\nThe Fulton County Medical Examiner\u2019s Office confirmed Bobbi Kristina\u2019s death Sunday night and will issue a news release on Monday.\n\nPolice said she was found Jan. 31. A police report described it as a \u201cdrowning.\u201d\n\nBobbi Kristina was the only child between Houston and Brown.\n\nShe was hospitalized for months in Atlanta \u2014 eventually being placed in hospice care \u2014 after being found in a manner grimly similar to the way her megastar mother died three years earlier. Gordon said at the time it seemed Bobbi Kristina wasn\u2019t breathing and lacked a pulse before help arrived.\n\nBrown \u2014 the sole heir of her mother\u2019s estate \u2014 did have dreams.\n\nShe identified herself on Twitter as \u201cDaughter of Queen WH,\u201d \u201dEntertainer/Actress\u201d with William Morris & Co., and \u201cLAST of a dying breed.\u201d\n\nShe told Oprah Winfrey shortly after her mother\u2019s death in 2012 that she wanted to carry on her mother\u2019s legacy by singing, acting and dancing. But her career never took off. Actor and producer Tyler Perry said she had a future as an actress after her debut on his TV show \u201cFor Better or Worse\u201d in 2012, but she only appeared in one episode. Aside from two ill-fated reality TV shows and the occasional paparazzi video, her image mostly showed up in the \u201cselfies\u201d she posted online.\n\nShe attended award shows and appeared on red carpets with her mother and father. She performed a duet with her mother in 2009, singing \u201cMy Love Is Your Love\u201d in New York\u2019s Central Park. She became social media sensation, sending more than 11,000 tweets and attracting 164,000 followers.\n\nAs the news of her death spread across social media, several celebrities tweeted their condolences.\n\nGrammy-winning performer Missy Elliot tweeted, \u201cMy heart is truly heavy. May u rest in peace with your mommy #BobbiKristina sending prayers 2 the Brown/Houston family.\u201d\n\n\u201cEmpire\u201d star Taraji P. Henson tweeted, \u201cRest in heaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cRIP #BobbiKristina My deepest sympathies 2 your father #BobbyBrown n your GrandMa #CissyHouston We will miss ya 4sho darling ;) Actress Vivica A. Fox said on Twitter.\n\nAnd Winfrey tweeted, \u201cPeace at Last!\u201d\n\nWhitney Houston, known as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweetheart,\u201d was an impossible act to follow.\n\nThe late singer sold more than 50 million records in the United States alone during her career. Her voice, an ideal blend of power, grace and beauty, made classics out of songs like \u201cSaving All My Love For You,\u201d \u201dI Will Always Love You\u201d and \u201cThe Greatest Love of All.\u201d She earned six Grammys and starred in the films \u201cThe Bodyguard\u201d and \u201cThe Preacher\u2019s Wife.\u201d\n\nBobby Brown, who had a bad-boy image, also became a huge star, selling platinum records with New Edition and going solo before drugs and legal woes derailed his career.\n\nBobbi Kristina appeared alongside both parents in 2005 on the Bravo reality show \u201cBeing Bobby Brown,\u201d which captured her parents fighting, swearing and appearing in court. The Hollywood Reporter said it revealed that Brown was \u201ceven more vulgar than the tabloids suggest,\u201d and managed \u201cto rob Houston of any last shreds of dignity.\u201d\n\nYears earlier, as Houston was preparing to give birth to Bobbi Kristina, she expressly left Bobby Brown out of her will, putting everything in a trust \u201cfor the benefit of her children and more remote descendants,\u201d according to the Houstons\u2019 2012 petition.\n\nAfter their divorce in 2007, Houston kept custody of Bobbi Kristina and raised her alongside Gordon, an orphan three years older than her daughter. Houston brought Gordon into her family, and while she never formally adopted him or included him in the will, both teenagers called her \u201cmom.\u201d\n\nThe threesome\u2019s tight bond was shattered when Houston\u2019s assistant found the singer\u2019s lifeless body face-down in a foot of water in her bathtub at the Beverly Hilton just before the Grammy Awards in 2012. Authorities found prescription drugs in the suite, and evidence of heart disease and cocaine in her body, but determined her death was an accidental drowning.\n\nBobbi Kristina, then 18, was at the hotel and became so hysterical she had to be hospitalized. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t only a mother, she was a best friend,\u201d she told Winfrey.\n\nShe and Gordon then went public with their romance, posting defiant messages online after the tabloids accused them of incest.\n\nThe Houstons tolerated their relationship, appearing with them on television that year in Lifetime\u2019s reality show \u201cThe Houstons: On Our Own.\u201d\n\nBut in one telling episode, the late singer\u2019s relatives lectured the pair about drinking after they show up in an obviously altered state, and accused Gordon of failing to take care of the grieving girl.\n\nRelations between Gordon and some other relatives continued to sour over the past year after Bobbi Kristina was hospitalized. A protective order barred him from being within 200 feet of Pat Houston, Bobbi Kristina\u2019s aunt. A feud erupted over whether Gordon could visit Bobbi Kristina while she stayed in the hospital.\n\nOn June 24, Bobbi Kristina\u2019s court-appointed representative sued Gordon, accusing him of misrepresenting his relationship with Bobbi Kristina. The complaint accused him of being violent toward her and taking more than $11,000 from her account while she was in a medically induced coma after the Jan. 31 tragedy.\n\nThe lawsuit also accused Gordon of assault, battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, unjust enrichment and conversion.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said he and his office are interested in reviewing the investigative file to determine whether any charges will be filed.\n\nAlso on June 24, Pat Houston said Bobbi Kristina had been placed in hospice care.\n\nBobbi Kristina was fabulously wealthy for a teenager, but her money was in a spendthrift trust, designed to keep creditors and predators from taking advantage of people who can\u2019t manage their money. Bobbi Kristina\u2019s grandmother, Cissy Houston, and aunt, Pat Houston, eventually took over control of the trust and then took Bobbi Kristina to court to protect the estate.\n\nThe Houstons called Bobbi Kristina \u201ca highly visible target for those who would exercise undue influence over her inheritance and/or seek to benefit from (her) resources and celebrity,\u201d and urged a judge to delay how quickly she could control the money.\n\nBobbi Kristina agreed to the delay, and the judge granted their request to seal the case.\n\nThe size of Houston\u2019s estate is a privately held secret.\n\nIn May, a judge appointed Bobby Brown and Pat Houston as co-guardians of Bobbi Kristina, giving them joint responsibility in decisions related to her care and medical needs. Lawyer Bedelia Hargrove was appointed conservator to oversee Bobbi Kristina\u2019s assets, including her rights and legal claims.\n\nHouston signed a $100 million record deal in 2001, but failed to deliver, and lost two homes to foreclosure toward the end of her life. But her untimely death revived a hunger for her music, and her name and likeness generated revenue that became part of Bobbi Kristina\u2019s inheritance.\n\nBy January 2014, the young couple who grew up as brother and sister were sharing a townhome in Roswell, Georgia, and calling themselves husband and wife.\n\nThey posted images of their hands wearing wedding rings, with the caption \u201c#HappilyMarried. So #InLove. If you didn\u2019t get it the first time that is.\u201d They got identical \u201cWH\u201d tattoos with flying doves on their wrists, and Gordon added a large portrait of Houston\u2019s face on his arm.\n\nTheir marriage announcement troubled Pat Houston, who obtained a restraining order against Gordon two months later.\n\n\u201cDamn, lol, it\u2019s incredible how the world will judge you 4ANY&EVERYthing,\u201d Bobbi Kristina tweeted at the time.\n\nBy last September, Pat Houston said she was \u201cvery proud of Krissy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYoung people today are up against so much with social media and everything else that presents itself to them,\u201d Pat Houston told The Associated Press. \u201cWe try to be there for her, just to try to guide and direct her.\u201d\n\nJudging from her postings online, Bobbi Kristina was focused on the approaching anniversary of her mother\u2019s death. In one of her last tweets, she said, \u201cLittlelady&yourgrowing young man @nickdgordon miss you mommy ..:\u2019) SOmuch.. loving you more every sec. #Anniversary!\u201d\n\n___\n\nContributors include Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Florida; Kathleen Foody in Atlanta and Mesfin Fekadu in New York.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The brief, chaotic life of Bobbi Kristina Brown was never really her own.
