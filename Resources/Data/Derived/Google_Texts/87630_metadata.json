Cabela's in Mitchell is seeing an increase in traffic and higher sales this year.\n\nGeorgia native Herman Davis was looking for a Browning vest for his afternoon pheasant hunt.\n\n\"We'll look and see what they got and probably go out of here with a few hundred dollars\u2019 worth of stuff,\" Davis said.\n\nSome hunters say pheasant season can burn a hole in their pockets. To be prepared, Davis spent all year saving up for state-wide event.\n\nDavid Werner is searching for a hunting rifle. Some of the guns are priced over $100,000.

That's the best part I think,\" Werner said.\n\nThe pheasant bird count is up 42 percent this year and that's bringing sales up for the outdoor store.\n\nCabela's workers say business is booming.
