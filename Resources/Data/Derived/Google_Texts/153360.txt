The Washington Free Beacon‘s Ellison Barber discussed the media’s limited coverage of Jonathan Gruber’s comments on “the stupidity of the American voter” Sunday with Fox News’ Sharyl Attkisson.

Barber argued the video should not be downplayed, since it was intended for broadcast to the American public–not a grainy, secretly recorded video.

Barber also said the media treats any Obamacare story as somehow ‘old news’ that the public is no longer interested in. However, Americans should not overlook the significance of Gruber’s comments.

“I think a lot of people in the media think this has been covered enough,” Barber said.

“It’s been beat to death, we have a lot of these talking points that we feel like we’re getting so we want to ignore it. This is an incredibly important legislation that changed an entire industry. It’s something that people should be watching like a hawk.”
