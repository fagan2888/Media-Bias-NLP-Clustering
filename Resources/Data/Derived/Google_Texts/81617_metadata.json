Since Obamacare was fully implemented, I\u2019ve been forced to pay premiums way out of my price range for coverage that I did not ask for. I have personally seen friends and family whose premiums have more than doubled as a result of Obama\u2019s failed policies. This is unacceptable and unsustainable. There are thousands of people just like me, who have seen their health care costs skyrocket. The Republican majorities in the House and Senate have made it clear: they want to get rid of Obamacare. My congressman, Patrick McHenry, has voted to repeal and replace Obamacare well over 60 times. He is a man of his word and has not faltered on this issue since the beginning. I remember attending his town hall meeting in 2009, and seeing him stand against what we could foresee as a bad law back then. It is refreshing when I see a politician keep their promises. Western North Carolina is fortunate to have Congressman Patrick McHenry representing us.\n\nJonathan Fletcher\n\nMount Holly", "article_metadata": {"msvalidate.01": "6E833E348BC9C2C4CE0B582759CD6CA6", "og": {"site_name": "Lincoln Times-News", "description": "Support for McHenry In today\u2019s economy, it is apparent that our country needs fundamental health insurance reform.
