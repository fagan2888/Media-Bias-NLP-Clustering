Or, more accurately, we should ignore a sizable chunk of Americans who want to repeal Obamacare. Repeal is a fringe position, in that Americans oppose it overwhelmingly. But it\u2019s also fringe in that those who do support it reside disproportionately on the periphery of the law itself. Their opinions matter insofar as they\u2019re eligible to vote, but for heuristic purposes we should ignore them.\n\nDell Stone, quoted in the Bloomberg article, is a textbook case.\n\nStone, 83, says she \u201ccertainly hopes\u201d the law gets repealed. She blames limits on medical testing in the act for her need to take cholesterol medication for three months this year after her cardiologist wasn't willing to repeat a seemingly inaccurate but very high reading. \u201cThe doctors are very dissatisfied, and many of them are not able to give their patients the attention that they feel that they need because they can\u2019t have too many appointments, too many tests,\u201d said Stone, a retired elementary school principal from Alexander City, Alabama.\n\nStone\u2019s antipathy to Obamacare stems from somewhere, but not from her interaction with the law itself. At 83, her frustrations with out-of-pocket health care costs are at best only tangentially related to Obamacare. She isn\u2019t shopping for insurance on the federally facilitated Alabama exchange. She\u2019s on Medicare. And she probably isn\u2019t unhappy that the law increased her taxes because it almost certainly didn\u2019t.\n\nOnly a third of the country supports full repeal, and, like the Republican coalition itself, it is a very old third\u2014comprised of the only people in the country with almost no stake in the law\u2019s core costs and benefits.\n\nAccording to the Kaiser Family Foundation, whose tracking poll is a touchstone for measuring public sentiment about Obamacare, the law is under water\u2014barely. Forty one percent of respondents hold favorable views of the ACA, while 43 percent hold unfavorable views. But if you break it out by age cohort, you find that that two percent margin is entirely attributable to people who have aged out of the program.\n\nAmong 18- to 64-year-olds\u2014the people who pay for the law, or are eligible for the law\u2019s benefits, or might become eligible for the law\u2019s benefits at some point in the future\u2014Obamacare is breakeven. Forty two percent favorable, versus 42 percent unfavorable. Among those whose opinions we should generally ignore on this issue\u2014old people\u2014it\u2019s a bloodbath. Only 36 percent view the law favorably, while 46 percent view it unfavorably.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the elderly would experience no change at all if Obamacare were to be repealed. Their prescription drug costs would increase, their Medicare advantage premiums and benefits might change. But even if seniors have legitimate gripes with the ACA\u2019s Medicare reforms, it doesn\u2019t stand to reason that we should care\u2014at all\u2014about their views of the law\u2019s coverage expansion in general.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a revealed bias, as when Washington Examiner\u2019s Byron York wrote that Obama\u2019s \u201csky-high ratings among African-Americans make some of his positions appear a bit more popular overall than they actually are.\u201d It\u2019s an argument that we shouldn\u2019t give everyone\u2019s views about Obamacare equal weight. The public sentiment animating the repeal movement is derived from people who have a negligible stake in the law, but who would like to throw millions of people off their new insurance plans before they die. Presumably we\u2019d have no problem ignoring old people if they objected to child tax credits financed by working-age people.
