United States threw out the conviction of a Pennsylvania man who was charged with making unlawful threats (it was never proven that he intended to threaten anyone) and sentenced to 44 months in jail after he posted allusions to popular rap lyrics and comedy routines on his Facebook page. It\u2019s a ruling that has First Amendment implications for where the government can draw the line when it comes to provocative and controversial speech that is protected and permissible versus speech that could be interpreted as connoting a criminal intent.\n\nThat same day, Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act, the legal justification allowing the National Security Agency (NSA) to carry out warrantless on Americans, officially expired. Over the course of nearly a decade, if not more, the NSA had covertly spied on millions of Americans, many of whom were guilty of nothing more than using a telephone, and stored their records in government databases. For those who have been fighting the uphill battle against the NSA\u2019s domestic spying program, it was a small but symbolic victory.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nTHE BAD NEWS: Congress\u2019 legislative \u201cfix,\u201d intended to mollify critics of the NSA, will ensure that the agency is not in any way hindered in its ability to keep spying on Americans\u2019 communications.\n\nThe USA FREEDOM Act could do more damage than good by creating a false impression that Congress has taken steps to prevent the government from spying on the telephone calls of citizens, while in fact ensuring the NSA\u2019s ability to continue invading the privacy and security of Americans.\n\nFor instance, the USA FREEDOM Act not only reauthorizes Section 215 of the Patriot Act for a period of time, but it also delegates to telecommunications companies the responsibility of carrying out phone surveillance on American citizens.\n\nAND NOW FOR THE DOWNRIGHT UGLY NEWS: Nothing is going to change.\n\nAs journalist Conor Friedersdorf warns:\n\n\u201cAmericans concerned by mass surveillance and the national security state\u2019s combination of power and secrecy should keep worrying.\u201d\n\nIn other words, telephone surveillance by the NSA is the least of our worries.\n\nEven with restrictions on its ability to collect mass quantities of telephone metadata, the government and its various spy agencies, from the NSA to the FBI, can still employ an endless number of methods for carrying out warrantless surveillance on Americans, all of which are far more invasive than the bulk collection program.\n\nAs I point out in my new book Battlefield America: The War on the American People, just about every branch of the government\u2014from the Postal Service to the Treasury Department and every agency in between\u2014now has its own surveillance sector, authorized to spy on the American people. Just recently, for example, it was revealed that the FBI has been employing a small fleet of low-flying planes to carry out video and cell phone surveillance over American cities.\n\nThen there are the fusion and counterterrorism centers that gather all of the data from the smaller government spies\u2014the police, public health officials, transportation, etc.\u2014and make it accessible for all those in power.\n\nAnd of course that doesn\u2019t even begin to touch on the complicity of the corporate sector, which buys and sells us from cradle to grave, until we have no more data left to mine. Indeed, Facebook, Amazon and Google are among the government\u2019s closest competitors when it comes to carrying out surveillance on Americans, monitoring the content of your emails, tracking your purchases and exploiting your social media posts.\n\n\u201cFew consumers understand what data are being shared, with whom, or how the information is being used,\u201d reports the Los Angeles Times. \u201cMost Americans emit a stream of personal digital exhaust \u2014 what they search for, what they buy, who they communicate with, where they are \u2014 that is captured and exploited in a largely unregulated fashion.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just what we say, where we go and what we buy that is being tracked. We\u2019re being surveilled right down to our genes, thanks to a potent combination of hardware, software and data collection that scans our biometrics\u2014our faces, irises, voices, genetics, even our gait\u2014runs them through computer programs that can break the data down into unique \u201cidentifiers,\u201d and then offers them up to the government and its corporate allies for their respective uses.\n\nAll of those internet-connected gadgets we just have to have (Forbes refers to them as \u201c(data) pipelines to our intimate bodily processes\u201d)\u2014the smart watches that can monitor our blood pressure and the smart phones that let us pay for purchases with our fingerprints and iris scans\u2014are setting us up for a brave new world where there is nowhere to run and nowhere to hide.\n\nFor instance, imagine what the NSA could do (and is likely already doing) with voiceprint technology, which has been likened to a fingerprint. Described as \u201cthe next frontline in the battle against overweening public surveillance,\u201d the collection of voiceprints is a booming industry for governments and businesses alike. As The Guardian reports, \u201cvoice biometrics could be used to pinpoint the location of individuals. There is already discussion about placing voice sensors in public spaces, and [Lee Tien, senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation] said that multiple sensors could be triangulated to identify individuals and specify their location within very small areas.\u201d\n\nSuddenly the NSA\u2019s telephone metadata program seems like child\u2019s play compared to what\u2019s coming down the pike.\n\nThat, of course, is the point.\n\nWhatever recent victories we\u2019ve enjoyed\u2014the Second Circuit ruling declaring the NSA\u2019s metadata program to be illegal, Congress\u2019 inability to reauthorize Section 215 of the Patriot Act, even the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition that free speech on the internet may be protected\u2014amount to little in the face of the government\u2019s willful disregard of every constitutional safeguard put in place to protect us from abusive, intrusive government agencies out to control the populace.\n\nAlready the American people are starting to lose interest in the spectacle of Congress wrangling, debating and negotiating over the NSA and the Patriot Act.\n\nAlready the media outlets are being seduced by other, more titillating news: Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s Vanity Fair cover, Kim Kardashian\u2019s pregnancy announcement, and the new Fifty Shades of Grey book told from Christian\u2019s perspective.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether, when all is said and done, the powers-that-be succeed in distracting us from the fact that the government\u2019s unauthorized and unwarranted surveillance powers go far beyond anything thus far debated by Congress or the courts.\n\nCopyright 2015 \u00a9 The Rutherford Institute\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and do not necessarily reflect Mint Press News editorial policy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Free Speech, Facebook and the NSA: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "John Whitehead | The Rutherford Institute", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "Free Speech, Facebook and the NSA: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", "title": "Free Speech, Facebook and the NSA: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/free-speech-facebook-and-the-nsa-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/206266/", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/poster_from_postermywall.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-04T14:25:55-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Free Speech, Facebook and the NSA: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "https://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/poster_from_postermywall.jpg", "title": "Free Speech, Facebook and the NSA: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Insights", "tag": "USA PATRIOT Act", "published_time": "2015-06-04T14:23:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-04T14:25:55-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "Free Speech, Facebook and the NSA: The Good, the Bad and the UglySuddenly the NSA\u2019s telephone metadata program seems like child\u2019s play compared to what\u2019s coming down the pike.\nAlready the American people are starting to lose interest in the spectacle of Congress wrangling, debating and negotiating over the NSA and the Patriot Act.\nAs journalist Conor Friedersdorf warns:\u201cAmericans concerned by mass surveillance and the national security state\u2019s combination of power and secrecy should keep worrying.\u201dIn other words, telephone surveillance by the NSA is the least of our worries.\nThat same day, Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act, the legal justification allowing the National Security Agency (NSA) to carry out warrantless on Americans, officially expired.\nFor instance, imagine what the NSA could do (and is likely already doing) with voiceprint technology, which has been likened to a fingerprint."}
