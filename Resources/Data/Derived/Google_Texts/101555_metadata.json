I think it\u2019s accurate, but no one has the report.\u201d\n\nNo one, that is, apart from the Government, which has yet to release the first PwC report despite Prime Minister Perry Christie promising the BIA that it will do so.\n\nThe administration\u2019s reluctance to release the document could thus easily be interpreted as a sign of its continued secrecy, and hesitance to make public an inconvenient truth. In the meantime, stakeholders and the Bahamian people can only speculate on the PwC report\u2019s contents.\n\nTribune Business understands the report was compiled by PwC\u2019s Bahamian arm with assistance from a US consultant, which may have contributed to the ObamaCare-type proposal.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise known as ObamaCare, facilitates the sale of private insurance to US citizens and offers subsidies to persons who cannot afford their own health insurance coverage.\n\nSuch a model would likely impose a smaller cost burden on the economy and Bahamian taxpayer, as it would only finance health insurance for those that cannot afford it - rather than the all-encompassing NHI proposal, which would finance health insurance for 100 per cent of residents.\n\nMr Komolafe, meanwhile, said the BIA had made little progress in resolving the impasse with the Government over the second PwC study on NHI.\n\nAs previously reported, the accounting firm has been recalled to assess the NHI cost estimates provided by both the Bahamian insurance industry and Sanigest, given that they are hundreds of millions of dollars apart.\n\nThe BIA, though, is resisting the Government\u2019s efforts to cover the process in secrecy, and prevent the findings from being revealed to the Bahamian public.\n\n\u201cThere are two main outstanding issues,\u201d Mr Komolafe said, confirming that resolution was some distance away. \u201cHaving given our data, we\u2019re insistent that we get a copy of the final report.\u201d\n\nDescribing this as \u201cstandard practice\u201d and the norm globally, although apparently not for the Bahamian government, Mr Komolafe added: \u201cThe second issue is that when we get the report, there\u2019s no gag order. We should be able to speak to it.\u201d\n\nThe BIA chairman said he was going to e-mail the Prime Minister yesterday in a bid to set up another NHI meeting between the Government and the insurance industry, adding that the latter \u201cwant to help as much as we can\u201d with the healthcare reform efforts.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been open and candid in our views, and are trying to work with the Government,\u201d Mr Komolafe said, adding that the Government \u201ccan end up with a product\u201d that works if it incorporates the ideas of all stakeholders.\n\nThe Prime Minister used the BIA\u2019s 40th anniversary banquet on Saturday night to hit out at what he described as the organisation\u2019s, and Mr Komolafe\u2019s, \u201cpublic relations exercise\u201d on NHI.\n\nEmphasising that he did not want to fight the insurance industry over an initiative he described as being in the Bahamian national interest, Mr Christie said the BIA would get what it was seeking by talking to, \u201cnot beating on\u201d, him.\n\nMr Komolafe and the BIA yesterday avoided responding directly to Mr Christie\u2019s comments, but said they had an \u201cobligation\u201d to contribute to the national debate on an initiative described by the Prime Minister himself as the \u2018single biggest development\u2019 post-independence.\n\n\u201cThe position of the Bahamas Insurance Association (BIA) has always been that we are committed to working with the Government to implement universal health coverage (UHC) in the Bahamas in a manner that is affordable, sustainable and least disruptive to the industry and economy at large. Other stakeholders have expressed similar sentiments,\u201d the BIA said in a written statement.\n\n\u201cThe significance and importance of universal healthcare to the Bahamas cannot be overemphasised. The Prime Minister had indicated that NHI will be the \u2018single biggest development\u2019 in the Bahamas, post-independence.\u201d\n\nStriking a conciliatory tone, the BIA added: \u201cWe do not want to fight with the Government on a progressive social initiative that is designed to serve the best interest of the Bahamian people; after all, we all support the principle of universal healthcare.\n\n\u201cWe agree that such a fight is unnecessary, especially seeing that we do not disagree on the fundamental need for universal health coverage in the Bahamas.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.tribune242.com/news/2015/oct/27/obamacare-model-urged-bahamas-healthcare-reform/", "type": "article", "title": "ObamaCare model urged for Bahamas healthcare reform"}, "description": "Private sector stakeholders believe an accounting firm has advised the Government to take a completely different approach to healthcare reform and adopt an ObamaCare-style plan for the Bahamas, rather than the proposed National Health Insurance (NHI) model.", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0d3\"", "article_summary": "By NEIL HARTNELLTribune Business Editornhartnell@tribunemedia.netPrivate sector stakeholders believe an accounting firm has advised the Government to take a completely different approach to healthcare reform and adopt an ObamaCare-style plan for the Bahamas, rather than the proposed National Health Insurance (NHI) model.\n\u201cThere are two main outstanding issues,\u201d Mr Komolafe said, confirming that resolution was some distance away.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), otherwise known as ObamaCare, facilitates the sale of private insurance to US citizens and offers subsidies to persons who cannot afford their own health insurance coverage.\n\u201cThe significance and importance of universal healthcare to the Bahamas cannot be overemphasised.\nMr Komolafe, meanwhile, said the BIA had made little progress in resolving the impasse with the Government over the second PwC study on NHI."}
