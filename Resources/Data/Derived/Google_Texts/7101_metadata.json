CREDIT: (AP Photo/Stephen Jaffe, IMF)\n\nThe United States is facing new international pressure to raise its minimum wage. In its annual review of the U.S. economy released on Monday, the International Monetary Fund criticized America for wages that are both historically low and lower than other countries, and it called on the U.S. to raise its wages accordingly.\n\nAddressing the U.S.\u2019s persistently high poverty rates, the report lauds the U.S.\u2019s expansion of health care coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act, then argues for two separate policy fixes to further aid in the reduction of poverty: expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to cover more low-income people and raising the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cAn expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit\u2014to apply to households without children, to older workers, and to low income youth\u2014would be [an] effective tool to raise living standards for the very poor,\u201d the report states. \u201cSimilarly, the government should make permanent the various extensions of the EITC and the improvements in the Child Tax Credit that are due to expire in 2017.\n\n\u201c[G]iven its current low level (compared both to U.S. history and international standards), the minimum wage should be increased,\u201d it goes on. \u201cThis would help raise incomes for millions of working poor and would have strong complementarities with the suggested improvements in the EITC, working in tandem to ensure a meaningful increase in after-tax earnings for the nation\u2019s poorest households.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. ranks 11th of OECD countries in minimum wage, when measured as a percentage of median income.\n\nThe EITC and Child Tax Credits currently have the highest impact on working-aged people with children and successfully keep millions out of poverty. But many have proposed exactly what the IMF suggested in its latest report: expanding the EITC to reach more people, including low-income elderly and young people, to alleviate some of the pockets of poverty not currently covered by the credit. Advocates have also pushed to keep expansions of the Child Tax Credit, first instituted as stimulus, that have since financially assisted millions of poor people with kids.\n\nThe United States\u2019 financial assistance to its poor lacks in comparison to other developed nations, so it\u2019s no surprise that the IMF is pinpointing the country\u2019s poverty policies as an important factor in its financial outlook.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The IMF says increasing the minimum wage is key to reducing the U.S. poverty rate.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The IMF says increasing the minimum wage is key to reducing the U.S. poverty rate.", "title": "Major International Finance Organization Criticizes U.S. Minimum Wage", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/06/16/3449360/imf-minimum-wage-us/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/christine-lagarde.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The IMF says increasing the minimum wage is key to reducing the U.S. poverty rate.", "title": "Major International Finance Organization Criticizes U.S. Minimum Wage", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/christine-lagarde-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@ARStrasser", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-economy", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/christine-lagarde.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/christine-lagarde.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-16T11:26:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Minimum Wage CREDIT: APIMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde participating in a seminar: The Economic Case for Climate Action, Tuesday, Oct. 8, 2013, at the World Bank in Washington.\n\u201c[G]iven its current low level (compared both to U.S. history and international standards), the minimum wage should be increased,\u201d it goes on.\nCREDIT: (AP Photo/Stephen Jaffe, IMF)The United States is facing new international pressure to raise its minimum wage.\nEconomy Major International Finance Organization Criticizes U.S.\nAdvocates have also pushed to keep expansions of the Child Tax Credit, first instituted as stimulus, that have since financially assisted millions of poor people with kids."}
