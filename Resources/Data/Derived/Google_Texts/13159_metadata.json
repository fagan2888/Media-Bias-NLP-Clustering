Jaime Herrera Beutler, R-Camas, said on Tuesday it\u2019s time for her party to demonstrate Congress is capable of doing something.\n\nThe 113th Congress established a reputation as the \u201cdo-nothing Congress.\u201d On Tuesday, the 114th Congress was sworn in.\n\nRepublicans have majorities in both chambers for the first time in eight years.\n\n\u201cMore than ever, we need to prove the ideas and principles we stand for are going to work,\u201d Herrera Beutler said in an interview from Washington. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t let egos, attitudes and personalities get in the way. And it\u2019s funny, I feel like everybody was happy and cheerful but I feel my perspective is a little bit more no-nonsense.\u201d\n\nHerrera Beutler joined the majority of her colleagues in the House and voted in favor of re-electing Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, to his post as speaker. About two dozen more conservative Republicans voted against the incumbent.\n\nRepublicans are expected to go after some big-ticket items as soon as later this week; approval of the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline is expected to be the first big move.\n\nIf the measure reaches President Barack Obama\u2019s desk, he will veto it, according to his spokesman, who spoke to national publications.\n\nHerrera Beutler believes the pipeline would bring tremendous benefits and economic opportunities.\n\nRepublicans in Congress have also said they will move swiftly to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI still think this doesn\u2019t do what it needed to do, which is give people access to quality, affordable health care, and we can do better,\u201d Herrera Beutler said.\n\nOn local issues, Herrera Beutler said she will soon be outlining her top priorities for each county she represents. Overall, she\u2019ll focus on job creation and improving infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always bridges, roads and potholes we need to address,\u201d she said.\n\nThis will be Herrera Beutler\u2019s third term in Congress. During her second term, her child, Abigail Beutler, was born prematurely and without kidneys. The girl gained national attention for surviving her malady, known as Potter syndrome.\n\nOn Tuesday, Abigail was with her mother on the U.S. floor as lawmakers were sworn in.\n\n\u201cShe ate it up, she loved it,\u201d Herrera Beutler said.\n\nAbigail is healthy, her mother said, but needs to weigh more before she can undergo a kidney transplant.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s gaining more slowly than we would have preferred, which isn\u2019t a problem other than we\u2019re anxious, we would like to get past that milestone,\u201d Herrera Beutler said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "With Republicans controlling both chambers, U.S. Rep.
