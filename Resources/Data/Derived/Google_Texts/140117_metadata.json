A sample of the weapons \u2014 mortars, M16-A4 assault rifles and anti-tank missiles \u2014 were placed on a white satin-covered table with camouflage netting.\n\n\u201cThis is just the latest in a series of deliveries that have arrived in the last 36 hours,\u201d said U.S. ambassador David Hale at the air base.
