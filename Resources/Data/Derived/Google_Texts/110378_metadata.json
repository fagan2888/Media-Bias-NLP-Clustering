A new class, called \u201cComedy Literature and Performance,\u201d will be co-taught by Drama Director Kathleen Woods and English teacher Lucy Filppu. \u201cWe\u2019re working to get as many students as we can through the doors of the theater,\u201d Woods said.\n\nThe opening of the Performing Arts Center comes as the Palo Alto Unified School District (PAUSD) seeks to re-emphasize the arts at a time when many students are focusing on technology.Kevin Skelly, who was the PAUSD superintendent when the Performing Arts Center was initially pitched in 2007, is excited for the facility to inspire students with many different interests.\u201cThe arts are a vital part of being an educated person,\u201d Skelly, who is now superintendent of the San Mateo Union High School District, said in a phone interview. \u201cI think we\u2019re getting back to that in education.\u201dThe center was originally set to open in 2014, but it faced delays amid a building boom on campus that includes a Media Arts Center, a Math/Social Sciences building and an Athletic Field Concession Facility, all funded by the same bond measure. It is now set to open before the next school year begins.\n\nThe Performing Arts Center\u2019s theater includes a motorized orchestra pit that can be raised or lowered to accommodate various audience sizes and a full fly loft allowing a stage crew to safely change scene effects. The structure also includes a patio and an area for building and storing major set pieces. Multiple green rooms and dressing rooms accommodate performers. Students will be trained to use professional equipment in the facility, preparing them for projects beyond Paly.\n\nThe historic 98-year-old Haymarket Theater across from the new structure will continue to be used for now as a rehearsal and storage space. While the Haymarket\u2019s acoustics haven\u2019t suited choir and music performances, the new building, equipped with a Meyer Sound System, can accommodate performances for drama, choir and band.The structure, while modern in design, complements the historic buildings at Paly and Stanford University with its traditional red roof and cream color. Solar energy will be used to heat and cool the building.Although the Performing Arts Center will first be a campus facility, people involved with planning said there is wide anticipation that outside groups will eventually perform there. \u201cIf it\u2019s only used for the school, that would be a shame. It should be used for other groups when the school\u2019s not using it. And I think it will be,\u201d Skelly said.\n\nThe facility is able to accommodate the sound systems of touring productions. The lobby can hold various events and the outdoor patio encourages community mingling. \u201cIt\u2019s really a prime location on campus and for the community,\u201d said Project Architect Brad Gunkel, who hopes to cultivate community engagement in the arts.\n\nThe new Performing Arts Center is the result of extensive advocacy by district staff, teachers and community members, some of who are continuing to shepherd the project to completion.Holly Ward, president of Paly Performing Arts Boosters, a local nonprofit, was involved in getting the initial design for the center approved by the school board. Though her children have graduated from Paly, Ward personally pledged to raise $200,000 from the community to provide the finishing touches to the structure that weren\u2019t in the initial budget.Paly librarian Rachel Kellerman, a member of the Facilities Steering Committee at Paly, said although it took time to propose the Performing Arts Center and to receive funding from the school bond to construct it, the project \u201cspeaks volumes\u201d about how \u201cintegral\u201d the arts are to students of Palo Alto, a sentiment echoed by the teachers.\u201cStudents in the arts perform better. They perform better on tests. They\u2019re stronger emotionally, socially, they really are walking out with all these great skills,\u201d said Woods, the drama director. \u201cBut there\u2019s still a very strong belief that STEM matters more. And I\u2019m not saying they don\u2019t matter, I\u2019m just saying the arts matter equally.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Peninsula Press", "description": "Palo Alto High School's new Performing Arts Center includes a 582-seat theater and a classroom that doubles as a performance space.", "title": "Long-awaited $29 million Paly Arts Center scheduled to open next school year - Peninsula Press", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-23T10:33:56+00:00", "url": "http://peninsulapress.com/2016/03/21/palo-alto-high-school-performing-arts-center/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PeninsuPress", "section": "Culture", "tag": "schools", "published_time": "2016-03-21T10:02:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-23T10:33:56+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Palo Alto High School's new Performing Arts Center includes a 582-seat theater and a classroom that doubles as a performance space.", "creator": "@PeninsuPress", "image": "http://peninsulapress.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/FullSizeRender-1.jpg", "title": "Long-awaited $29 million Paly Arts Center scheduled to open next school year - Peninsula Press", "site": "@PeninsuPress", "card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The new $29 million Performing Arts Center at Palo Alto High School (Paly) opening this fall hopes to attract more students to the performing arts program by offering professional technical equipment and interdisciplinary classes.\nThe Performing Arts Center \u2014 whose construction funding came out of a 2008 bond measure \u2014 includes a 582-seat theater and a classroom that doubles as a performance space.\nThe new Performing Arts Center is the result of extensive advocacy by district staff, teachers and community members, some of who are continuing to shepherd the project to completion.Holly Ward, president of Paly Performing Arts Boosters, a local nonprofit, was involved in getting the initial design for the center approved by the school board.\nStudents will be trained to use professional equipment in the facility, preparing them for projects beyond Paly.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working to get as many students as we can through the doors of the theater,\u201d Woods said."}
