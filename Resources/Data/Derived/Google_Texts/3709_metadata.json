As part of the game, visitors are locked in and have to escape within an hour using teamwork, creativity and \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d thinking.\n\nThe Anne Frank foundation, which manages the museum in the canal-side house that includes the Frank family\u2019s hidden apartment, said the apartment was one of the places where the Holocaust, or Shoah, played out and said, \u201cIt shows very little empathy for survivors of the Shoah to use the annex as a backdrop for an escape room.\u201d\n\nThe bunker \u201ccreates the impression that hiding (from the Nazis) is an exciting game and if those hiding are smart enough they won\u2019t be caught,\u201d the foundation said, calling that impression historically wrong.\n\nThijs Verberne, the operator of the bunker, defended it in a telephone interview, calling the escape room \u201can educational experience.\u201d\n\nAnne Frank became posthumously famous for the diary she kept while her family went into hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam. The Jewish teenager died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in March 1945, shortly before it was liberated by Allied forces.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "NewBostonPost", "language": "en-US", "url": "http://newbostonpost.com/2016/03/21/museum-criticizes-anne-frank-themed-escape-room/", "article_author_name": "Associated Press", "image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/23187193695_c1db19e4ba_b.jpg", "site_id": "ab905d8abdbd23a369259b08e0927728", "shareable_page": "true", "keywords": "Anne Frank, criticize, escape room, jewish, museum, Nazi, Netherlands, theme, world war II"}, "description": "The Anne Frank foundation on Friday criticized an \"escape room\" game made to look like the Amsterdam apartment where the teenage Jewish diarist hid with her", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"image": "http://newbostonpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/23187193695_c1db19e4ba_b.jpg"}, "keywords": "anne frank,escape room,nazi,jewish,netherlands,museum,world war ii,criticize,theme", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc87f\"", "article_summary": "Museum criticizes Anne Frank-themed \u2018escape room\u2019Printed from: http://newbostonpost.com/2016/03/21/museum-criticizes-anne-frank-themed-escape-room/(Courtesy of Flickr)AMSTERDAM (AP) \u2014 The Anne Frank foundation on Friday criticized an \u201cescape room\u201d game made to look like the Amsterdam apartment where the teenage Jewish diarist hid with her family from the Netherlands\u2019 Nazi occupiers during World War II.\nAccording to its website, the recently opened Escape Bunker in the town of Valkenswaard, 140 kilometers (87 miles) south of Amsterdam, has a room styled to look like the apartment.\nAs part of the game, visitors are locked in and have to escape within an hour using teamwork, creativity and \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d thinking.\nThe Jewish teenager died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in March 1945, shortly before it was liberated by Allied forces.\nThijs Verberne, the operator of the bunker, defended it in a telephone interview, calling the escape room \u201can educational experience.\u201dAnne Frank became posthumously famous for the diary she kept while her family went into hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam."}
