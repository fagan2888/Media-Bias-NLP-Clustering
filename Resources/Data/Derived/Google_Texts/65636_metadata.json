After all, Congress and the executive branch are famously filled with lawyers, wealthy business executives, academics and a sprinkling of doctors and career military officers, among other professionals. These serious and sober-minded roles presumably require critical thinking skills, independent judgment and incisive expression. Right? But if you ask most lawmakers or administration officials about a complex policy issue, they\u2019re apt to spout tired talking points, poll-tested pabulum and stock phrases devoid of substance or originality. Their press releases are formulaic; and their speeches may be full of bluster, but they are short on imagination.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLast week, when speaking to an industry group that opposes the Affordable Care Act\u2019s tax on medical devices, Hillary Clinton was vague: \u201cOn the tax itself, again, I think we have to look to see what are the pluses and minuses that are embodied in a decision about either to remove or alter or continue this particular piece of the Affordable Care Act.\u201d This came just before she called for more \u201cproblem solvers\u201d in Washington and, as politicians are wont to do, set herself above the partisan debate: \u201cI just think we have to get out of the ideological wars that either we can\u2019t change anything or we have to change everything, and begin to be smart and pragmatic problem solvers again.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s as if, before entering the political world, they\u2019re all given lessons on how to inspire without making promises, to insult without appearing mean and to be a politician without sounding like one\u2014in other words, to avoid speaking straight.\n\nComplaints about political language are hardly new. In a famous 1946 essay, George Orwell groused that it \u201cis designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.\u201d But if anything, doubletalk and weasel words proliferate now more than ever. They\u2019re a manifestation of both parties\u2019 desires to doggedly stay on message amid a rapacious 24-7 news cycle and the compulsion of some politicians to pass judgment\u2014on Twitter, on TV or in Politico\u2014on most of the issues that surface during it.\n\nIn doing research for our new book on political rhetoric, we came across five general categories of Washington-speak\u2014the devices that today\u2019s politicians use in their never-ending quests to one-up each other while, at the same time, appearing spontaneous\u2014and productive\u2014to voters. Here\u2019s what you need to know to keep up with the best of them\u2014if that\u2019s what you want to do.\n\n***\n\n1. The polite knife in the back. Politicians like to be liked. So even when sticking it to an opponent, they have an incentive to stay positive. Even casual C-SPAN viewers will recognize the most common forms of this passive-aggressive approach.\n\nTake \u201cmy good friend\u201d\u2014politician-speak for somebody he or she often can\u2019t stand. \u201cMy good friend\u201d is most commonly used on the House or Senate floors when addressing a colleague. Usually it\u2019s a thinly veiled way of showing contempt for the other lawmaker while adhering to congressional rules of decorum. When Democratic Rep. Gene Green of Texas first arrived on Capitol Hill in the early 1990s, he recalled, \u201cThe joke we had was, when someone calls you their good friend, look behind you. I try not to say it unless people really are my good friends.\u2019\u201d\n\nA linguistic cousin of \u201cmy good friend\u201d is another term favored by an older generation of House members: \u201cminimum high regard.\u201d Former Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, who held several Democratic leadership positions during his tenure from 1979 to 2005, turned us on to this time-honored knock against political foes. Frost recalled \u201cone House member saying to another during floor debate: \u2018I hold the gentleman in minimum high regard.\u2019\u201d Frost helpfully translated the phrase for us: \u201cIt means, \u2018You are an idiot.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also \u201ccounterproductive,\u201d which, as Brookings Institution President Strobe Talbott told National Public Radio, is \u201ca word we use here in Washington to mean \u2018stupid.\u2019\u201d And lawmakers have found they can get away with almost anything if they preface it with, \u201cWith all due respect.\u201d That\u2019s just what Maryland Democratic Rep. Chris Van Hollen did in a December 2013 MSNBC interview chiding Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul that Congress would be doing a \u201cdisservice\u201d to workers by extending unemployment benefits. \u201cWith all due respect to Sen. Rand Paul, that is a ridiculous argument,\u201d said Van Hollen. \u201cHere he is blaming people who are out of work through no fault of their own, who are still looking for work\u2014and that\u2019s a condition of continuing to receive unemployment compensation.\u201d Seems like there\u2019s a lot of respect there.\n\n2. Avoidance of the \u201cL\u201d word\u2014at least publicly. Politicians generally shy away from calling each other liars outright. While not as taboo as it once was, it\u2019s still considered bad form\u2014at least in person\u2014to accuse someone of out-and-out prevarication. (Just ask South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson, who famously cried \u201cYou lie!\u201d during Obama\u2019s 2009 State of the Union Address and earned a formal rebuke from the House of Representatives.) Instead, today\u2019s political figures use words like \u201cdisingenuous\u201d in describing an opponent they see as a hopeless twister of the truth.\n\nHere\u2019s Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, complaining in March 2012 about President Obama\u2019s comments that the courts would be guilty of judicial activism if they overturned the Affordable Care Act: \u201cIt\u2019s sort of disingenuous and foolish as a lawyer and a former law professor.\u201d\n\n\u201cDisingenuous\u201d can even transcend lying to encompass a whole category of behavior that is despised, as when Obama visited Oklahoma in 2012 to discuss the administration\u2019s record of domestic oil drilling. Far-right Sen. James Inhofe told a local newspaper: \u201cI welcome President Obama to my home state, but his visit is disingenuous on a number of levels.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "Just follow these 5 simple tips and you'll be on your way to the big leagues.", "title": "How to Talk Like a Politician", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/10/how-to-talk-like-a-politician-111841.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/10/13/141013_markmccutcheon_hillary_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Speeches,Hillary Clinton,Politics,Rhetoric", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "Just follow these 5 simple tips and you'll be on your way to the big leagues.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Instead, today\u2019s political figures use words like \u201cdisingenuous\u201d in describing an opponent they see as a hopeless twister of the truth.\nNo matter what your political beliefs, you probably long ago reached one conclusion about our nation\u2019s public servants: As much as they love to hear themselves talk, many of them aren\u2019t very good at it.\nTheir press releases are formulaic; and their speeches may be full of bluster, but they are short on imagination.\n\u201cWith all due respect to Sen.
