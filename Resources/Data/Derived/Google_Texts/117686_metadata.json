With the Los Angeles Rams trading up for the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft, maybe it\u2019s time to say: Welcome to Denver, Colin Kaepernick.\n\nChristian, reading the tea leaves\n\nKiz: In one respect, NFL execs are no different than fans drinking beer on the sofa. Everybody in NFL Nation goes cuckoo for quarterbacks. The absurd trade made by the Rams was great for \u2026 Tennessee, which unloaded the No. 1 pick. It now seems likely that no matter how you rank them, quarterbacks Carson Wentz and Jared Goff will be the first two players taken in the draft. Quarterback run! That\u2019s not good for the Broncos. We here at Kickin\u2019 It Headquarters like Memphis quarterback Paxton Lynch. But is it reasonable to expect Lynch will now fall to 15th or lower in the opening round, where Denver could trade up to get him? The Magic 8-Ball says: Outlook not so good.\n\nOvercooked. Well, is Lynch that much better than Connor Cook of Michigan State? So much info flying around, it\u2019s hard to tell. I heard someone say Cook was the college QB most ready to play in the NFL.\n\nDoug, in the QB hunt\n\nKiz: Video study, player interviews and hand size all matter when evaluating a quarterback. But what a player does on the field in a big game counts the most. If you watched Cook lead Michigan State on the winning drive against Iowa in the Big Ten championship game, you might love him. But I also saw Cook get beat 38-0 by Alabama in his final collegiate game, and don\u2019t understand the first-round love for him. If you\u2019re asking me, the best quarterback in recent Sparty history is Kirk Cousins, not Cook.\n\nDak data. When it comes to passing ability, Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott is John Elway when compared with Tim Tebow.\n\nEddie, Dallas-Fort Worth\n\nKiz: I think the Broncos would be crazy to select Cook with the final pick in the opening round. While the scouting staff here at Kickin\u2019 It Headquarters isn\u2019t doing yippy-skippy cartwheels over Prescott, we\u2019re willing to keep an open mind on him. Yes, he\u2019s better than Tebow. Prescott, however, is a project who should not see the field in 2016. So, late in the second round, I\u2019d rather take a gamble on the health of Notre Dame linebacker Jaylon Smith.\n\nBernie was bad. And today\u2019s parting shot looks back in anger at the summer of 1996, when Nuggets general manager Bernie Bickerstaff passed on a chance to draft Kobe Bryant or Steve Nash, then let Dikembe Mutombo walk as a free agent:\n\nThanks for the reminder, Kiz, of how badly Bickerstaff messed up the most fun, promising group of Nuggets I\u2019ve ever experienced. I\u2019ve long said Bickerstaff was the most destructive figure in Denver sports history.\n\nMatt, bitter (and for good reason)", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kickin\u2019 it with Kiz: Run on QBs would be bad for the Broncos", "title": "Kickin\u2019 it with Kiz: Run on QBs would be bad for the Broncos", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/16/kickin-it-with-kiz-run-on-qbs-would-be-bad-for-the-broncos/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160402__BN20160403_CC2_BNSP03MARKTROYp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160402__BN20160403_CC2_BNSP03MARKTROYp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-16T14:40:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T03:18:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Kickin' It With Kiz"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe028a\"", "article_summary": "1 pick in the NFL draft, maybe it\u2019s time to say: Welcome to Denver, Colin Kaepernick.\nWhen it comes to passing ability, Mississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott is John Elway when compared with Tim Tebow.\nEddie, Dallas-Fort WorthKiz: I think the Broncos would be crazy to select Cook with the final pick in the opening round.\nChristian, reading the tea leavesKiz: In one respect, NFL execs are no different than fans drinking beer on the sofa.\nBut is it reasonable to expect Lynch will now fall to 15th or lower in the opening round, where Denver could trade up to get him?"}
