Many people don\u2019t realize that affordable health insurance is available to them,\u201d Tuttle said.\n\nThe report found that as a result of Obamacare, the percentage of uninsured in San Diego County has decreased from 22 percent to 14 percent, while 60 percent of the population continues to receive health benefits through their employers.\n\nOpen enrollment for coverage under Obamacare began Nov. 15 and continues through Feb. 15. You can apply online through Covered California, the online marketplace implementing Obamacare in California.\n\n>> Subscribe to Times of San Diego\u2019s free daily email newsletter!
