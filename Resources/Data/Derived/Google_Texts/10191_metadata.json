The support from the community, our amazing volunteers, and everyone in this community was just incredible. We had no idea it was going to be such a big event.\"\n\nA pair of Sterling High School cross-country runners, Isaac Bernatchez and Marc Tapparo, finished first and second, respectively, while Ashley Atkins finished first for the females.\n\nBut, perhaps the best moment of the day came when Debbie Gerlach, Scott's wife of 25 years, crossed the finish line at 47 minutes, 50 seconds and yelled out four familiar words: \"I love you, Scott!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor Debbie, the time was a personal record for her in a 5K and an achievement she credits Scott for helping her reach.\n\n\"I knew Scott helped me finish that race. And set a PR (personal record),\" said Debbie Gerlach, who describe her relationship with Scott as \"love at first sight.\"\n\nDebbie said the two knew each other in high school and, after just two weeks of dating during their young adult years, they each knew they found \"the one\" and Scott proposed to her in July \u2014 making the Saturday, July 12, event date that much more meaningful.\n\nWendy Jerman (left), Debbie Gerlach (center) and Alma Blagg (right) near the finish line during Saturday's Scott Gerlach Memorial Run 5K race.

My daughter came up with the idea that Friday night (after Scott's accident) and Alma came over that Saturday and said 'We should do a 5K race.' I was like 'Amber, here you go!'\"\n\nDistance running wasn't always a passion for Scott and Debbie, but rather an unexpected bonding exercise brought on by a desire to stay fit for their grandchildren.\n\n\"In 2011, we decided we needed to be around for our granddaughter, who was born in 2012. In June of 2011, we started watching the 'Biggest Loser' and started working out, exercising, and doing all we could to get fit,\" Debbie said. \"In August, after watching an episode where they put on a half marathon for the \"Biggest Loser,\" we decided if they can run one, we can too. We trained for the next eight months and ran in the Colorado Marathon.\"\n\nThat marked the first of three Colorado Marathons they would run together. Debbie said her son, Austin, will now run in his father's spot as her distance race running mate.\n\nAs for the future of the Scott Gerlach Memorial run, Debbie said the family would like to make it an annual event, with future proceeds going to charity or scholarships.\n\n\"We've been tossing around ideas. My granddaughter got really sick and if it wasn't for Children's Hospital, I don't think she would have made it, so one of our ideas is to donate proceeds to Children's Hospital,\" Debbie said. \"We also want to give proceeds, in years forward, toward scholarships. We haven't decided which ones or what they'd be for, but that's where we are heading with it.\"\n\nThe desire for future Scott Gerlach Memorial runs is one also shared by Blagg and Jerman, who each said they would not hesitate to help put on the event again.\n\n\"We don't want him (Scott) forgotten because he was such an incredible human being,\" Jerman said. \"That man had a smile 24/7 and we were honored to be a part of his life.\"\n\nContact David Wilson at 970-526-9285 or dwilson@journal-advocate.com", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sports/ci_26143282/community-rallies-runs-scott-gerlach-memorial-5k", "sailthru.author": "By David Wilson \n \n  Journal-Advocate sports writer", "ag": {"canon": "JournalAdvocate:article:26143282:view"}, "startDate": "2014-07-13T21:17:29-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "journal-advocate.com", "description": "Less than two months after losing one of their own, the Logan County community rallied together on Saturday in a time to heal, and to celebrate the life of Scott Gerlach in the first annual Scott Gerlach Memorial 5K Run.", "title": "Community rallies, runs in Scott Gerlach Memorial 5K", "url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sports/ci_26143282/community-rallies-runs-scott-gerlach-memorial-5k", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/0713/20140713__14STGerlachmemorial~1.jpg", "site": "@SterlingJA", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/0713/20140713__14STGerlachmemorial~1_300.jpg", "modificationDate": "2014-07-13T23:21:24-0600", "endDate": "2024-07-13T21:10:41-0600", "description": "Less than two months after losing one of their own, the Logan County community rallied together on Saturday in a time to heal, and to celebrate the life of Scott Gerlach in the first annual Scott Gerlach Memorial 5K Run.", "byline": "By David WilsonJournal-Advocate", "pubDate": "2014-07-13T21:19:42-0600", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-13T21:17:29-0600", "sailthru.title": "Community rallies, runs in Scott Gerlach Memorial 5K", "verify-v1": "BXs3Tp/yfKM8u4D/sQH/llaXrumTjsEN3+pi+oLzohs=", "sailthru.section": "Sports", "news_keywords": "Sports, Sports news, Sterling Colorado Sports news, Sterling Colorado news, Sports Sterling news, Sports Colorado news, US Sports news, world Sports news.", "sailthru.site": "journal-advocate.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.journal-advocate.com/sports/ci_26143282/community-rallies-runs-scott-gerlach-memorial-5k", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/0713/20140713__14STGerlachmemorial~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Less than two months after losing one of their own, the Logan County community rallied together on Saturday in a time to heal, and to celebrate the life of Scott Gerlach in the first annual Scott Gerlach Memorial 5K Run.", "title": "Community rallies, runs in Scott Gerlach Memorial 5K"}, "google-site-verification": "2iNkVYi6fQKhylL0pQaJF4qvYsz3qMnvr9EdKrmIbvw", "y_key": "b781c784225bf6e2", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site19/2014/0713/20140713__14STGerlachmemorial~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Wendy Jerman (left), Debbie Gerlach (center) and Alma Blagg (right) near the finish line during Saturday's Scott Gerlach Memorial Run 5K race.\nOver $9,000 estimated to have been raised for Gerlach familyClick photo to enlarge \u00ab12\u00bbLess than two months after losing one of their own, the Logan County community rallied together on Saturday in a time to heal, and to celebrate the life of Scott Gerlach in the first annual Scott Gerlach Memorial 5K Run.\nAnd set a PR (personal record),\" said Debbie Gerlach, who describe her relationship with Scott as \"love at first sight.\"\nThe desire for future Scott Gerlach Memorial runs is one also shared by Blagg and Jerman, who each said they would not hesitate to help put on the event again.\n\"We never in our wildest dreams thought the memorial race would be this incredible."}
