I want that place to post prices. It\u2019s in CVS\u2019s interest to pull in more and more pieces of that puzzle.\u201d\n\nA typical CVS clinic staffed by nurse practitioners sees 35 to 40 patients a day; those patients pay $79 to $99 for minor illnesses and injuries, and most insurance plans are accepted. Analysts estimate each clinic typically brings in $500,000 a year, representing just a fraction of CVS\u2019s revenue. Still, the clinics are an important part of the company\u2019s health care proposition.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOther retailers are also getting into the business. The number of retail clinic sites grew to 1,800 locations nationwide in 2014 from 200 in 2006, though they still represent just 2 percent of primary care encounters in the United States, according to a report published this year by Manatt Health, a health advisory practice, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. But CVS is by far the leader. Walmart, which charges just $40 a visit, has fewer than 100 clinics, compared with the more than 900 in CVS\u2019s portfolio. Walgreens, the second-largest, has half as many clinics as CVS. And CVS plans to add more, reaching 1,500 by 2017, the company has said.\n\nWhether these clinics provide the best kind of care is a question sometimes raised by doctors in more traditional practices, like Robert Wergin, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians and a doctor in Milford, Neb.\n\n\u201cThese retail clinics, they\u2019re run by competent folks, and they probably have some role to play,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you\u2019re being seen at a clinic next to the frozen food section by a stranger. And if you go back for a follow-up, you\u2019re going to get seen by someone else.\u201d\n\nFor employers and insurers, however, the clinics offer a way to reduce costs for noncritical conditions. A study by researchers at the RAND Corporation estimated that more than a quarter of emergency room visits could be handled at retail clinics and urgent care centers, creating savings of $4.4 billion a year.\n\nReducing health care spending, however, may turn out to be complicated.\n\n\u201cYou might imagine that they keep people out of E.R., so that\u2019s one way you could save money,\u201d said Martin Gaynor, professor of economics and public policy at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. \u201cOn the other hand, just because they\u2019re more convenient, people might go and obtain care in circumstances where they otherwise would not have sought care.\u201d\n\nCVS might have more sway reducing health care costs in its role as a middleman between drug companies and patients with drug benefits. The company is expected to start shifting the balance between end users on one hand, and drug manufacturers and wholesalers on the other.\n\nCVS and other large dispensing pharmacies \u2014 Walgreens, Express Scripts, Rite Aid and Walmart \u2014 made up about 64 percent of prescription-dispensing revenue in the United States in 2014, according to Pembroke Consulting. That year, CVS was also the leading provider of specialty drugs in North America, with $20.5 billion in revenue, representing 26 percent of the total market.\n\n\u201cScale is a big factor in pharmacy,\u201d said Joseph Agnese, senior equity analyst at S&P Capital IQ. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pricing pressure from drug manufacturers and one way for retailers can come back at them is to become larger, and become a more significant purchaser of drugs.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDr. Gaynor of Carnegie Mellon said, however, that cost reduction varied greatly by type of drug. \u201cIf there\u2019s a drug that is very important for CVS to carry, and there are no alternatives, they aren\u2019t going to have a lot of negotiating power,\u201d Dr. Gaynor said. \u201cBut of course, the bigger CVS gets, the more they can move product, the more important it becomes.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s size also creates significant competition issues, says David A. Balto, an antitrust lawyer and former policy director at the Federal Trade Commission who often represents independent pharmacies. CVS\u2019s ownership of Caremark could restrict consumers\u2019 access to rival pharmacies, he said, and CVS\u2019s acquisition of Omnicare, already a dominant player in long-term care, could reduce competition in that industry.\n\n\u201cThere are tremendous concerns when you see someone becoming so terrifically large,\u201d Mr. Balto said. \u201cThe acquisitions might conceivably be efficient, but whether those efficiencies are passed on to consumers really depends on the level of competition in the market.\u201d\n\nQuitting Cigarettes\n\nHelena B. Foulkes, who leads CVS\u2019s retail business, swept past the sales counter at a newly renovated CVS in downtown Manhattan. Where cigarette packs once lined up in neat rows, now there were nicotine gum and patches to help smokers quit. (There are no e-cigarettes either, much to the chagrin of that industry, which had hoped CVS would embrace its products as a lower-risk alternative.)\n\nPhoto\n\nMs. Foulkes, who lost her mother to lung disease, leads the retail business, which is starting to change to fit the company\u2019s health care bent better.\n\nThe move to forgo $2 billion in annual tobacco sales has bolstered CVS\u2019s health care bona fides. The White House lauded CVS\u2019s move. \u201cThanks @CVS_Extra, now we can all breathe a little easier,\u201d Michelle Obama wrote in a Twitter post. The praise seemed to give Mr. Merlo a jolt of confidence. At a TEDx talk this year in Winston-Salem, N.C., he declared: \u201cCVS kicks butts across the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we exited the tobacco category, it was the most important decision we\u2019d made as a company,\u201d Ms. Foulkes said. \u201cThat decision really became a symbol both internally and externally for the fact that we\u2019re a health care company.\u201d\n\nIt also made economic sense. Adult smoking rates have dropped to 18 percent in 2014, from 43 percent in 1965, according to the Centers for Disease Control, and experts predict that rate to dip below 10 percent in the next decade. Ditching cigarettes allows CVS to trade a small \u2014 less than 2 percent of revenue \u2014 and shrinking part of its business for an instant enhancement of its credentials in the faster-growing health and wellness space.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn October, CVS announced that its Caremark arm would require some of its customers to make higher co-payments for prescriptions filled at pharmacies that still sold tobacco products \u2014 in effect driving more traffic to the now tobacco-free CVS pharmacies. While that move encourages pharmacies to quit selling tobacco, it also raised the ire of an antitrust law research firm, which called the announcement \u201ca smokescreen\u201d that masks higher costs for those who fill prescriptions at competing pharmacies.\n\n\u201cCVS\u2019s use of its market power to bludgeon consumers and rivals into ending tobacco sales is not a legitimate form of competition,\u201d the American Antitrust Institute said in a statement. It has urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate.\n\nIn general, CVS\u2019s new anti-tobacco stance has helped it forge affiliations with regional hospitals. Before CVS went tobacco-free, negotiations with local health systems were awkward, Mr. Merlo said during a recent analyst conference call.\n\n\u201cThat question would always come up \u2014 \u2018You guys sell tobacco products, don\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2014 and that literally sucks all the energy out of the room,\u201d Mr. Merlo said. But since the company stopped selling tobacco, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to accelerate partnerships with leading health systems across the country.\u201d\n\nA new partnership with Rush University Medical Center in Chicago will involve patient referrals and shared electronic health records. Anthony Perry, vice president for ambulatory care and population health at Rush, said that traditional health care providers and companies like CVS could be natural allies.\n\n\u201cTake people with high blood pressure. That\u2019s the type of thing you manage steadily over time, and you work on things like diet and exercise, and lifestyle changes, and if those things don\u2019t work, you get into the world of medications,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we asked was: If we\u2019re going to do a series of visits with somebody, might they be able to do some of that closer to home?\u201d\n\nThe flip side, he said, is that CVS can refer people with more serious ailments, but no primary care doctor, to Rush. \u201cSo CVS can now say: You need to see a primary care doctor, and we can connect you.\u201d\n\nThe anti-tobacco stand has had other effects. Notably, the company has had to start thinking about other unhealthy items on its shelves. If it is a company that promotes health, can it also sell sugary sodas and candy bars?\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe downtown Manhattan store where Ms. Foulkes walked the aisles is one of 500 locations that CVS is remodeling to emphasize healthy fare.\n\n\u201cI was in Long Island the day after the tobacco announcement, and I ran into a store manager who said: \u2018I\u2019m so proud of the company,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201cBut he also said, \u2018I\u2019m hearing customers now saying, why don\u2019t you have healthier food?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cCustomers quickly made the leap. They expected more from us,\u201d she said.\n\nMs. Foulkes pointed to a prominent snack corner at the front of the store.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019ll see in our stores are brands that convey healthy without being overly edgy. It\u2019s Chobani yogurt, it\u2019s Kind bars, it\u2019s lots of proteins and nuts,\u201d she said. \u201cHealth for the masses.\u201d\n\nAt this point, there are no plans to stop selling high-fat or high-sugar snacks, still a big part of CVS stores\u2019 sales. But they might be harder to spot.\n\nWhen asked where the Oreos were, she smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ll find them, but you\u2019ll have to look for them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150711061407, "twitter": {"description": "The pharmacy retailer that stopped selling cigarettes last year is also expanding its in-store clinics, a business well suited to the quickly evolving health care landscape.", "title": "How CVS Quit Smoking and Grew Into a Health Care Giant", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/business/how-cvs-quit-smoking-and-grew-into-a-health-care-giant.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003792874"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "HirokoTabuchi", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/business/12-CVS-JP1/12-CVS-JP1-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/business/how-cvs-quit-smoking-and-grew-into-a-health-care-giant.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003792874", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/business/how-cvs-quit-smoking-and-grew-into-a-health-care-giant.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business", "channels": "NytNow", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "July 11, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "CVS Caremark Corporation", "keywords": "CVS Caremark Corporation,Smoking and Tobacco,Health Insurance and Managed Care,Drugstores,Drugs (Pharmaceuticals)", "news_keywords": "Drugstore", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Hiroko Tabuchi", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/business/12-CVS-JP1/12-CVS-JP1-thumbLarge-v2.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By HIROKO TABUCHI", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "The pharmacy retailer that stopped selling cigarettes last year is also expanding its in-store clinics, a business well suited to the quickly evolving health care landscape.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/business/12-CVS-JP1/12-CVS-JP1-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "description": "The pharmacy retailer that stopped selling cigarettes last year is also expanding its in-store clinics, a business well suited to the quickly evolving health care landscape.", "CG": "business", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "July 11, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/hiroko_tabuchi/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/business/index.html", "section": "Business Day", "modified": "2015-08-04", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "tag": "Drugs (Pharmaceuticals)", "published": "2015-07-11", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "12cvs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150804110202, "hdl_p": "Why CVS Quit Smoking", "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/business/how-cvs-quit-smoking-and-grew-into-a-health-care-giant.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/12/business/12-CVS-JP1/12-CVS-JP1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The pharmacy retailer that stopped selling cigarettes last year is also expanding its in-store clinics, a business well suited to the quickly evolving health care landscape.", "title": "How CVS Quit Smoking and Grew Into a Health Care Giant"}, "pdate": 20150711, "des": "Drugs (Pharmaceuticals)", "articleid": 100000003792874, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "How CVS Quit Smoking and Grew Into a Health Care Giant", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf9a\"", "article_summary": "Anthony Perry, vice president for ambulatory care and population health at Rush, said that traditional health care providers and companies like CVS could be natural allies.\n\u201cThat decision really became a symbol both internally and externally for the fact that we\u2019re a health care company.\u201dIt also made economic sense.\nThe move to forgo $2 billion in annual tobacco sales has bolstered CVS\u2019s health care bona fides.\nReducing health care spending, however, may turn out to be complicated.\nIn that fast-changing world, CVS\u2019s strategy is to be a one-stop shop for health care."}
