Speaking on a phone call with a group of California Republicans on Friday, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus vowed that changes to the GOP’s presidential primary process would fix a system that had become a “complete disaster.”

Arguing that his plan to reduce the number of presidential debates for the 2016 presidential primary is “not an establishment takeover,” Priebus said changing his party’s nomination system is simply about “using your brain.”

“Everything’s not a conspiracy,” he added.

“I think a traveling circus of debates is insanity in this party,” Priebus went on to say to about 200 delegates. “We’re proposing to have fewer than 10 and, this time around, we’re going to pick the moderators.” During the 2012 nomination process, Republican presidential candidates held no fewer than 27 debates.
