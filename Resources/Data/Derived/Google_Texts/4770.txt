Police use pepper spray, Taser to subdue dogs; 1 may not survive

A woman suffered serious injuries to her hands after being mauled trying to break up a fight between her three English bull terriers during what Longmont police are calling a "massive dog fight" on Saturday night.

Cmdr. Jeff Satur said the woman's St. Bernard also got caught up in the fight, but was not being aggressive with officers.

All the dogs were injured, and one might not survive.

Satur said police responded to 21 Exner Place at 10:30 p..m. Saturday on a report of a woman, 55, being mauled by multiple dogs and screaming for help.

Five officers found the woman being attacked by her dogs, and they began to pepper-spray the animals and hit them with batons, Satur said.

Satur said officers were able to round up three of the dogs, but had to use a Taser to subdue the last one.

"The fourth dog was not as easy," Satur said. "Eventually, it was clear that pepper spray was not convincing this dog to back down."

All of the dogs were taken to a veterinary clinic, but one might not survive because of injuries sustained in the dog fight, Satur said.

He said the woman was taken to Longmont United Hospital, but has since been released.

"The owner was very thankful at the hospital," Satur said. "She very much appreciated the efforts put forth to save her, get her dogs safely into custody and get them the medical attention they needed."
