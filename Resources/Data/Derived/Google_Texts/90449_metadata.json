DeVita Jr. began his career as an oncologist. That\u2019s no coincidence, since DeVita, along with a few colleagues, invented it.\n\nIn the 1960s, when he was only a few years out of medical school, DeVita led a team that discovered cures for childhood leukemia and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. Giving desperately ill patients several potentially toxic drugs at once with the goal of curing cancer seemed, to many doctors at the time, both cruel and futile. Today, combination chemotherapy, adjuvant therapy (using chemo with surgery and radiation), specialized cancer centers, and many other advances that DeVita helped pioneer have contributed to sharp declines in mortality from malignancies once assumed fatal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow 80 years old and a professor of medicine at Yale, DeVita is pleased with the progress he\u2019s seen in the field he\u2019s shaped over the past five decades as director of the National Cancer Institute, physician-in-chief at Memorial Sloan Kettering, and in other powerful roles. Pleased, but not satisfied.\n\nIn \u201cThe Death of Cancer,\u2019\u2019 a fascinating new memoir written with his daughter, Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn, DeVita argues that while we\u2019re finally winning the \u201cwar on cancer,\u2019\u2019 which began in the 1970s and of which he was a chief architect, physicians too timid to prescribe aggressive treatments often deny patients with cancer potential cures. He also faults the \u201coverly cautious\u2019\u2019 FDA for delaying the release of promising new therapies and the Affordable Care Act for not covering them.\n\nEarly in the book DeVita tells how he called colleagues around the country to enroll a friend with prostate cancer in one experimental protocol after another. The man lived for 12 more years, much longer than predicted. \u201cI will do whatever it takes to cure patients and, if that isn\u2019t achievable, keep them going as long as possible,\u201d DeVita writes.\n\nSadly, DeVita had a chance to apply this credo when his son developed aplastic anemia, a rare disorder that destroys the immune system. The boy lived for eight years in a germ-proof room and received experimental therapy at the hospital where his father worked before dying at age 17.\n\nDeVita\u2019s moving account of his son\u2019s illness, as well as that of his own recent bout with prostate cancer, help soften what feels, at times, like a litany of criticism. DeVita judges harshly individuals and institutions whose efforts in the fight against cancer he deems inadequate. He names names, including that of the late Edward M. Kennedy, who sat on a Senate panel that questioned DeVita about the ethics of the cancer-drug development program at the National Cancer Institute. DeVita excoriates Kennedy for his willingness \u201cto play political games with cancer,\u201d noting sharply: \u201cYou might think that given his son Ted junior had had cancer and survived, years earlier, and that I was one of doctors involved in his case, we\u2019d be on the same side.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMore appealing are DeVita\u2019s portrayals of the many colorful characters he\u2019s encountered in his long career, including an assortment of vain, jealous, and drunk colleagues; a patient who sent a vintage Rolls Royce to pick DeVita up for house calls; and Ann Landers, who used her popular advice column to solicit support for the 1971 bill that launched the national campaign to defeat cancer.\n\nParticularly delightful are DeVita\u2019s memories of his collaboration with philanthropist Mary Lasker. Though the elegantly coiffed Lasker \u201chad the appearance of a lightweight socialite with too much time on her hands,\u201d she proved shrewd, smart, and as determined to cure cancer as DeVita was. Lasker, who along with her husband established the Lasker Award, the \u201cAmerican Nobel\u201d for medical research, also helped create the American Cancer Society, and pressed for massive increases in federal spending on cancer research. DeVita\u2019s revelations about Lasker\u2019s methods \u2014 she once paid a spy to infiltrate Congress \u2014 are especially entertaining.\n\nThe most interesting character in DeVita\u2019s book, though, is cancer itself. His detailed explanations of how \u201cclever\u201d cancer cells evade normal genetic checks on growth and how new drugs like Gleevec, which can cure the previously lethal chronic myelogenous leukemia, outwit them are both riveting and encouraging.\n\nSiddhartha Mukherjee called his Pulitzer Prize winning \u201cThe Emperor of All Maladies\u2019\u2019 a \u201cbiography\u201d of the disease. \u201cThe Death of Cancer\u2019\u2019 is its obituary. We\u2019re at \u201cthe beginning of the end,\u201d DeVita declares of the war on cancer. He accepts that people will still die of something. But, DeVita notes wryly, \u201cWe can worry about immortality after we cure cancer.\u201d\n\nTHE DEATH OF CANCER:\n\nAfter Fifty Years on the Front Lines of Medicine, a Pioneering Oncologist Reveals Why the War on Cancer is Winnable \u2014 And How We Can Get There\n\nBy Vincent T.
