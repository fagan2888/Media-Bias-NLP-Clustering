As a result, the best estimate now places the portico repair no earlier than 1923 and not much later than 1941.\n\n\u201cThis was key,\u201d Smith says of the find. \u201cVery helpful.\u201d\n\nIt is just one interesting discovery as the approximately $450,000 renovation gets underway, one designed by structural engineer Craig Bennett and being built by Richard Marks Restorations Inc.\n\nVisitors have been able to see the failing concrete beams \u2014 chunks of which had spalled off as its steel rods have rusted and expanded \u2014 for at least a decade. They may have missed other signs of the portico\u2019s problems, such as stucco cracks on the lentils over the first floor columns and the slight bow of the two outer limestone columns and supporting brick columns.\n\nThe work is designed to address all of those problems, first by removing the concrete floor and replacing it with a new series of joists made from salvaged, old-growth wood. The joist pockets will be lined with copper or lead to protect the wood from the bricks\u2019 moisture, and the new wood decking will get a hidden, waterproof membrane to direct rainwater away. The checkerboard sandstone and limestone pavers will be replaced \u2014 except for the marble pieces.\n\nJust as Smith and others weren\u2019t sure of the concrete, they\u2019re even less sure of the portico\u2019s original construction.\n\n\u201cWas it stone on wood, or was it totally a wood deck? We can\u2019t tell,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThe solution we\u2019ve devised is something we think could have been used historically. And it has no concrete.\u201d\n\nThe work also includes new support for the second-floor portico. When workers wanted to assess if the brick wall under the stairs could hold an additional load, they removed a brick and drilled a hole large enough to insert a camera.\n\nIts images showed part of the house that was sealed up possibly before the American Revolution, including a vaulted space that supports the stairs and mysterious brick rubble on the ground.\n\nThe hope is the new portico will last a century, though its design will allow much more incremental repair as needed than the current work.\n\nThis construction is scheduled to finish later this year. Until then, the house\u2019s most iconic facade will be a construction zone, though the museum house remains open for tours.\n\nIt may look like a bit of a shock, as Drayton Hall\u2019s acting executive director Carter Hudgins Jr. notes, \u201cThis is a little more dramatic than anything we\u2019ve done before.\u201d\n\nThose most familiar with the home, widely considered one of the best ever built in Colonial North America, may realize this new work marks a change in philosophy as far as how best to conserve the house.\n\nPreviously, that philosophy was to preserve its fabric as much as possible as it was handed down from the Drayton family to the National Trust for Historic Preservation in the 1970s.\n\nBut that philosophy, if followed without question, would cause Drayton Hall to rebuild a concrete addition that has damaged the house, and not to provide hidden structural re-enforcement to cope with its modern reality of welcoming about 60,000 visitors each year.\n\nAnd that would leave the home with no good choices. If a steel I-beam isn\u2019t inserted in the space between the first and second floor portico, then visitors should not be allowed to walk on it \u2014 or Drayton Hall will be rolling the dice of a disastrous collapse.\n\n\u201cStone doesn\u2019t give you a warning if it fails,\u201d Smith says. \u201cIf it fails, it fails suddenly and catastrophically.\u201d\n\nEven though the I-beam will be hidden, Smith says the work is a little more intrusive than Drayton Hall would like. \u201cBut we\u2019ve been trying to think about our character-defining features and how do we adjust our philosophy to maintain them. We think this is an acceptable trade-off.\u201d\n\nSo in the long run, preservation involves more than repairing, repainting, reroofing and the like.\n\nIt also involves rethinking.\n\nReach Robert Behre at 937-5771.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Decades later, a worker\u2019s snack wrapper offers clue to Drayton Hall repair, Features, \r\nFeaturesArchitecture, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nHome & Garden, \r\nRobert Behre, \r\nRobert Behre, Carter Hudgins Jr.,Craig Bennett,Drayton Hall,maintenance,Nabisco wrapper,portico,preservation,Richard Marks Restorations,Trish Smith", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "If a \u201ccookie\u201d is a small text file that provides information about a website\u2019s use, what small thing provides information about a historic portico?", "title": "Decades later, a worker\u2019s snack wrapper offers clue to Drayton Hall repair", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150718/150719416/decades-later-a-worker-x2019-s-snack-wrapper-offers-clue-to-drayton-hall-repair", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150718/PC1207/150719416/AR/0/AR-150719416.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150718/PC1207/150719416/AR/0/AR-150719416.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "If a \u201ccookie\u201d is a small text file that provides information about a website\u2019s use, what small thing provides information about a historic portico?", "title": "Decades later, a worker\u2019s snack wrapper offers clue to Drayton Hall repair", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150718/PC1207/150719416/AR/0/AR-150719416.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150719416}}, "keywords": "Decades later, a worker\u2019s snack wrapper offers clue to Drayton Hall repair , Features, \r\nFeaturesArchitecture, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nHome & Garden, \r\nRobert Behre, \r\nRobert Behre, Carter Hudgins Jr.,Craig Bennett,Drayton Hall,maintenance,Nabisco wrapper,portico,preservation,Richard Marks Restorations,Trish Smith", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-18T09:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-07-17T17:13:00Z", "author": "Robert Behre"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "If a \u201ccookie\u201d is a small text file that provides information about a website\u2019s use, what small thing provides information about a historic portico?"}, "article_summary": "On it was printed a Nabisco logo, and Trish Smith, Drayton Hall\u2019s curator of architectural resources, says that logo was used from 1923-41.\nAs a result, the best estimate now places the portico repair no earlier than 1923 and not much later than 1941.\n\u201cIf it fails, it fails suddenly and catastrophically.\u201dEven though the I-beam will be hidden, Smith says the work is a little more intrusive than Drayton Hall would like.\nTrish Smith holds a piece of Nabisco wrapper found during the demolition of Drayton Hall\u2019s portico, a sign that its concrete repair job was done sometime in the 1920s or 1930s.\nBut when workers recently began removing that concrete as part of a larger renovation project, they discovered a small piece of red paper."}
