The system can help employers with hourly, mobile, and/or remote workers to better manage compliance with complex wage and hour regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\n\nWith Paychex Flex Time, employers have their choice of time collection methods, including web punching, mobile devices, kiosks, and traditional biometric time clocks.
