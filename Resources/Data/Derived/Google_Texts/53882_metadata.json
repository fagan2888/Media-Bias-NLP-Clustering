The Senate, having wrapped up its business by dinner time Monday, will be in at 10 a.m. House members will start at 1 p.m.\n\nDay 31 is typically a subdued affair. The calendars in both chambers are expected to be light (House Rules won\u2019t meet to set the calendar until 12:20 p.m.) In committees, Senate Appropriations will take up the budget. Passage of the measure will set up negotiations between the House and Senate and is a sure sign that the 2014 session is winding down.\n\nThe Senate Education and Youth committee will take up HB 826, sponsored by state Rep. Ed Setzler, R-Acworth, which gives school officials more options \u2013 other than felony charges \u2013 when dealing with kids caught with pocket knives and such.\n\nQualifying for elected offices will continue on Tuesday. Also, Vice President Joe Biden will be in town to promote the Affordable Care Act and other administration priorities, and to help Democratic Senate candidate Michelle Nunn raise money.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/03/04/legislative-tip-sheet-pocket-knives-and-joe-biden/", "image": "http://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/030414_crossover_bs5.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "After a frenzied Crossover Day, lawmakers will be back at the state Capitol on Tuesday, working at a...", "title": "Legislative tip sheet: Pocket knives and Joe Biden | Political Insider blog"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "AJC blog about Atlanta politics, Georgia politics, Georgia and metro Atlanta election campaigns.
