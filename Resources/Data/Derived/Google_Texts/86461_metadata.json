I saved. And so will millions of Americans.\n\nHonestly, I couldn\u2019t wait to sign up for ObamaCare \u2014 not because I talk about it on television, but because I\u2019m tired of being ripped off by my insurance company.\n\nI live in New York State \u2014 which for several decades has had the highest individual insurance premiums in the nation.\n\nFor the past three years, since leaving a job at a non-profit organization and then exhausting my COBRA, I have relied on the individual insurance market to get coverage for myself, my partner and our daughter.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nThree years ago when I was shopping for insurance, there weren\u2019t that many options to choose from. And the plan I ended up with is expensive and, to put it bluntly, crappy.\n\nCurrently, I pay $965 per month for family coverage that includes:\n\n\u2022 a whopping $7,000 deductible;\n\n\u2022 $36,000 out-of-pocket max per year;\n\n\u2022 an annual coverage limit of $2,000,000;\n\n\u2022 a $35 co-pay for doctor\u2019s visits ($55 for specialists); and\n\n\u2022 a $15 co-pay for generic prescriptions.\n\nAll this plus the plan has very limited out-of-network coverage that, I found out the hard way, is subject to such a gauntlet of procedural hurdles that my family has spent thousands of dollars in so-far-unreimbursed out-of-network expenses.\n\nI\u2019m not going to tell you who my current provider is, though I\u2019m inclined to purely out of loathing and spite. But for the record, for over a year I paid for their version of \u201cgold\u201d coverage that had a $3,000 deductible, only a $25 doctor\u2019s co-pay and a $6,000 out-of-pocket max.\n\nBut that plan didn\u2019t process any of my reimbursements either and cost a whopping $1,687 per month. That\u2019s over $20,000 per year!\n\nYou can see why, regardless of what party I vote for, I was excited to have some more affordable options.\n\nSo I logged onto the New York State health insurance exchange website. Yeah, I had a few false starts \u2014 the website was down a lot early on either because of service glitches or overwhelming traffic.\n\nFor a few days, I couldn\u2019t do anything at all on the website.\n\nThen for a day or so I could \u201clog-in\u201d but not complete registration. And then for a day, I could answer the questions to complete my registration but not actually complete the process.\n\nOn one occasion, I got so frustrated at the stalled exchange website that I actually shook my computer.\n\nNot pleasant.\n\nBut finally, early on the first Saturday morning following the launch of the exchange site \u2014 probably because the rest of the state (unlike my five-year-old) was still asleep -- I was able to log-in and complete my registration and check out all my options for insurance.\n\nThere were literally 50 plans that were better than my current insurance -- both with lower premiums, lower out-of-pocket costs and better coverage. And there were ten plans with a higher premium than my current insurance, but with lower deductibles.\n\nSo -- and here\u2019s an important point -- the reason that more people haven\u2019t signed up for coverage yet is probably that, just like me, they needed to take some time (and first, find some time!) to weigh all the options.\n\nWhile the exchange site was user-friendly and explained my options in a clear and simple way, picking an insurance plan isn\u2019t exactly like ordering a hamburger. It took a minute to find my calculator and think about the options.\n\nWithin a week, I had settled on a \u201cgold\u201d plan offered by Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield. The plan includes:\n\n\u2022 a $2,000 total deductible;\n\n\u2022 an out-of-pocket max of $12,500 for the year;\n\n\u2022 a $30 co-pay for visits to our primary care doctor;\n\n\u2022 a $15 co-pay for generic prescriptions;\n\n\u2022 NO annual coverage limit \u2014 because that\u2019s now prohibited thanks to the Affordable Care Act; plus\n\n\u2022 an added bonus: the plan I selected includes child dental.\n\nThis option will cost my family $931 per month \u2014 $408 per year less than my previous crappy plan and a $5,000 savings in deductibles. A big win for me and my family financially and in terms of what\u2019s covered.\n\nPlus in the past, I spent several days looking for and comparing insurance options. Under ObamaCare, even with the slow and sticky website, I spent a total of four hours \u2014 to save over $5,400. That kind of return on investment would make Warren Buffett drool.\n\nCounter to wild stories about the government taking over health care, the exchange was simply a public portal to a range of all-private insurance options. I went with a \u201cgold\u201d plan for lower deductible and out-of-pocket costs. And I chose Blue Cross Blue Shield because my current primary doctor is in-network.\n\nBut one of the most exciting things is the new companies providing private insurance through the exchange; I\u2019ll be watching the reviews over the next year and might change plans when re-enrollment comes around.\n\nAs of October 20, the Associated Press reported that 476,000 Americans had filled out insurance applications through the federal and state exchanges. Not bad, considering the poor performance of the sign-up websites.\n\nBut it\u2019s only been 20 days since the exchanges launched, and folks have 60 more days (through December 15) to sign up for coverage to take effect on January 1, 2014. And people have 60 days after that (February 15) before the individual mandate penalty kicks in.\n\nIn other words, there\u2019s still plenty of time to fix the websites and for more Americans to enroll \u2014 and save. Meanwhile, we know that in a state like Oregon, ObamaCare has already reduced the number of uninsured individuals by 10%. Glitches aside, that\u2019s a great start.\n\nWe\u2019ve suffered through four years of outlandish attacks against ObamaCare -- that it will kill our grandmothers, or at least just kill our economy. But the fact is that ObamaCare has created a private marketplace so that millions of American families like mine can get affordable, quality health insurance while keeping more of our hard-earned money.\n\nIdeologues may not like ObamaCare, but my wallet and my family\u2019s health sure do.\n\nSally Kohn joined the Fox News Channel in 2012 as a contributor.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.modified": "2015-01-07 08:03:19 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Honestly, I couldn\u2019t wait to sign up for ObamaCare because I\u2019m tired of being ripped off by my insurance company.", "twitter": {"description": "Honestly, I couldn\u2019t wait to sign up for ObamaCare because I\u2019m tired of being ripped off by my insurance company.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/10/21/was-obamacare-guinea-pig.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/102113/0/0/102113_hn_baier_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "I was an ObamaCare guinea pig", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"author\":\"Sally Kohn\",\"subSection\":\"opinion\",\"title\":\"I was an ObamaCare guinea pig\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/102113/0/0/102113_hn_baier_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-21T18:24:33Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/10/21/was-obamacare-guinea-pig.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"d167cfd9-1c63-441c-bac8-dda4f6fb2723\",\"section\":\"opinion\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "Honestly, I couldn\u2019t wait to sign up for ObamaCare because I\u2019m tired of being ripped off by my insurance company.", "dc.identifier": "d167cfd9-1c63-441c-bac8-dda4f6fb2723", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "description": "Honestly, I couldn\u2019t wait to sign up for ObamaCare because I\u2019m tired of being ripped off by my insurance company.", "prism.section": "opinion", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "I Was An Obamacare Guinea Pig", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-07 08:03:19 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Honestly, I couldn\u2019t wait to sign up for ObamaCare because I\u2019m tired of being ripped off by my insurance company.", "title": "I was an ObamaCare guinea pig | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/10/21/was-obamacare-guinea-pig.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/102113/0/0/102113_hn_baier_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2013-10-21", "parsely-page": "{\"author\":\"Sally Kohn\",\"subSection\":\"opinion\",\"title\":\"I was an ObamaCare guinea pig\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/102113/0/0/102113_hn_baier_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-21T18:24:33Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2013/10/21/was-obamacare-guinea-pig.html\",\"post_id\":\"d167cfd9-1c63-441c-bac8-dda4f6fb2723\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"opinion\"}", "dc.creator": "Sally Kohn"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda063\"", "article_summary": "Meanwhile, we know that in a state like Oregon, ObamaCare has already reduced the number of uninsured individuals by 10%.\nSo I logged onto the New York State health insurance exchange website.\nUnder ObamaCare, even with the slow and sticky website, I spent a total of four hours \u2014 to save over $5,400.\nWe\u2019ve suffered through four years of outlandish attacks against ObamaCare -- that it will kill our grandmothers, or at least just kill our economy.\nPlus in the past, I spent several days looking for and comparing insurance options."}
