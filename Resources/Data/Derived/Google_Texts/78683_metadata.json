They not only came up short in the postseason again, they parted ways with manager Don Mattingly on Thursday. Los Angeles looks like a rich franchise searching for answers, wondering why all of that money it\u2019s spent has been to some degree an empty investment.\n\nMost ominous of all, Zack Greinke, the Dodgers\u2019 co-ace along with Clayton Kershaw, will likely opt out of a contract that has $71 million over three years remaining. As a free agent, Greinke can be expected to get multiple offers for $125 million to $150 million over five years.\n\nSan Francisco \u2014 World Series champions in 2010, 2012 and 2014 \u2014 was a worn-out team by the end of the 2015 season. With all of the changes they\u2019ve endured, the Giants seem ready for a prolonged fall.\n\nBut remember, I said \u201cat first glance\u201d it looks as if there is an opportunity for a team other than the Dodgers or Giants to win the NL West. A longer look reveals something else.\n\nFirst, only the Diamondbacks have a realistic shot to unseat the Big Two next year. The Padres and Rockies, two of baseball\u2019s most dysfunctional franchises over the past five years, have too many issues to even think about contending next year.\n\nArizona, meanwhile, is talented, athletic and getting better. After finishing 64-98 in 2014, the Diamondbacks improved to 79-83 this past season. However, to get over the hump, they need much better starting pitching, and I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll pony up to sign it.\n\nA strong free-agent class, headlined by Johnny Cueto, David Price and Greinke, will soon hit the open market. Other pitchers such as Mike Leake, Jeff Samardzija, Brett Anderson, Yovani Gallardo, Scott Kaz mir, Ian Kennedy and Jordan Zimmermann will also be available.\n\nBut will the Diamondbacks, with a projected payroll of about $100 million next season, be willing to pull the trigger on an ace? It\u2019s doubtful.\n\n\u201cIf you want to go after one of the top-tier guys, it\u2019s probably going to limit anything else we can do in the offseason,\u201d team president and CEO Derrick Hall recently told The Arizona Republic.\n\nThe Giants, however, with a projected 2016 payroll of about $170 million, seem poised to make a big addition. And, keep in mind, the Giants no longer have to pay salaries to pitchers Tim Lincecum, Tim Hudson and Jeremy Affeldt or to infielder Marco Scutaro.\n\nCEO Larry Baer recently told the San Francisco Chronicle that the Giants will take a \u201cpretty exhaustively\u201d look at free agency to boost a rotation anchored by Madison Bumgarner.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve shown over the years we\u2019re in the deal flow, so to speak,\u201d Baer said. \u201cWe may or may not push the button. They may or may not be the right fit in terms of years, dollars, culture. \u2026 We want to get ourselves right back there in 2016. Anything\u2019s possible, but it has to be the right fit.\u201d\n\nGiven the winning culture in San Francisco, and given that Bruce Bochy is one of the game\u2019s elite managers, I think the Giants will retool and be a World Series contender again next year.\n\nIn other words, I don\u2019t see a changing of the guard in the NL West.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or @psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Saunders: Does the Dodgers\u2019 postseason loss indicate a changing of the guard in the NL West?", "title": "Saunders: Does the Dodgers\u2019 postseason loss indicate a changing of the guard in the NL West?", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/10/24/saunders-does-the-dodgers-postseason-loss-indicate-a-changing-of-the-guard-in-the-nl-west/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-24T21:34:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:32:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Patrick Saunders"}, "article_summary": "In other words, I don\u2019t see a changing of the guard in the NL West.\nAs a free agent, Greinke can be expected to get multiple offers for $125 million to $150 million over five years.\nBut remember, I said \u201cat first glance\u201d it looks as if there is an opportunity for a team other than the Dodgers or Giants to win the NL West.\nThey not only came up short in the postseason again, they parted ways with manager Don Mattingly on Thursday.\nSan Francisco \u2014 World Series champions in 2010, 2012 and 2014 \u2014 was a worn-out team by the end of the 2015 season."}
