Where are you, Lady Gaga? Why so quiet, Kerry Washington, Marlon Wayans and Justin Long?

When HealthCare.gov debuted in October, the celebrity Obamacare cult jumped into action, tweeting pics that implored Americans to #GetCovered. We even suffered through Verne “Mini Me” Troyer parading his uncovered body on Twitter.

Now that it’s clear to everyone that Obamacare is uncovering the covered, the Twitter-verified accounts using the hashtag look a little different. Celebs clammed up within days of the O-care launch and haven’t returned to the #GetCovered fold. Instead, it’s been left to progressive groups and Dem politicians to humiliate themselves for the cause.
