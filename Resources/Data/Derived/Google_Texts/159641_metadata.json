(Photo: KATE MELTON)Buy Photo Story Highlights Paychex Inc. shares have averaged slightly more than $40 over the past month\n\nPaychex revenues were up 4 percent from the year before, to $2.3 billion\n\nNo pointed questions. No visible signs of discontent. The election of board members and the annual \"say on pay\" vote on executive compensation both passed easily.\n\nThese apparently are the marks of content Paychex Inc. shareholders.\n\n\n\nThe Penfield-based payroll and business services giant held its annual shareholder meeting Wednesday. Before an audience of dozens of stockholders, CEO Martin Mucci and Chief Financial Officer Efrain Rivera gave an overview of the company's recent performance and goals and fielded questions on such issues as the competitive landscape and how federal health care reform is affecting clients and the company itself.\n\nPaychex shareholders have plenty to be satisfied with. Shares have averaged slightly more than $40 over the past month, compared with slightly more than $33 over the same span in 2012, and $30.52 in 2008. The stock closed Wednesday at $41.17, up 45 cents or 1.1 percent.\n\nTen thousand dollars invested in 1983, when Paychex began trading on Nasdaq, would today be worth $2.3 million, Mucci said.\n\nFor its most-recent fiscal year, which ended in May, Paychex revenues were up 4 percent from the year before, to $2.3 billion, while profits were also up 4 percent, to $569 million.\n\nThe company is looking to new products \u2014 such as new capabilities for letting clients handle their company payrolls on their smartphones and tablets and services related to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and new geographies to help drive growth, Mucci told the crowd meeting in The Strong museum's theater.\n\nThe company has hired eight staff in Sao Paulo, Brazil, as it ramps up for a push into that payroll marketplace and roughly 5 million small and mid-sized potential clients, Mucci said. And its purchase in September of German payroll firm Lohndata doubles its clients there, he said. Paychex last week announced it had invested in Vancouver accounting software firm Kashoo, which could be its entry into more work in Canada. \"We continue to look at Canada,\" Mucci said. \"That may be the next country we think is the best opportunity for us.\"\n\nJohn Mueller, 73, of Penfield, has been a Paychex shareholder for a decade (when it was averaging roughly $36). He left the shareholder meeting Tuesday the way he walked in \u2014 pleased with his investment. \"It pays a good dividend,\" Mueller said. \"They're growing. There's no debt. What more could you ask for?\"\n\nMDANEMAN@DemocratandChronicle.com\n\nTwitter.com/mdaneman\n\nPaychex stock prices The price has risen nearly 32 percent since the beginning of the year.\n\nPrice Date\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1gkltOG", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The company also declared a regular quarterly dividend of 35 cents a share.", "og": {"site_name": "Rochester Democrat and Chronicle", "description": "The company also declared a regular quarterly dividend of 35 cents a share.", "title": "Paychex looks to Canada as next frontier", "url": "http://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/money/business/2013/10/16/paychex-holds-annual-shareholders-meeting/2993269/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/democratandchronicle.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The company also declared a regular quarterly dividend of 35 cents a share.", "title": "Paychex looks to Canada as next frontier", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1672e1464b7ba0050578b10f3e5843656aa117a1/c=134-0-666-532&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2013/10/16/mainimage.jpg", "creator": "@DandC", "site": "@DandC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028377", "fb": {"app_id": 176958652324613}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Companies/Paychex", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Companies/Paychex", "title": "Paychex looks to Canada as next frontier", "author": "Matthew Daneman", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "money/business", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cd21c54c9b6d2da311d27aab6f470704002e4ffe/c=200-0-599-532/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2013/10/16/mainimage.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/839fa56955016338e43e90e5e6ad53fa17ea0753/c=134-0-666-532/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2013/10/16/mainimage.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/41084305589b817e6c4509ceb7b96b924c486130/c=46-0-754-532/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2013/10/16/mainimage.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d3895af97610dec7f2813359db62fca6997a5721/c=0-40-800-492&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2013/10/16/mainimage.jpg", "publishtime": "2013-10-16T18:23:01-04:00", "shorthed": "Paychex holds annual shareholders meeting", "articleid": 2993269, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c72356212fa57a5cb54c140cde4db800fc98a9a9/c=0-40-800-492/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2013/10/16/mainimage.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2198807ee57f6e24f7c44ae6ff6484d52739c242/c=251-0-549-532/local/-/media/Rochester/NG/2013/10/16/mainimage.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Paychex Chairman B.
