Burwell. Bishop David Zubik heads the Diocese of Pittsburgh and Sylvia Mathews Burwell is the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n\u201cThis is an extraordinary time for the Diocese of Pittsburgh and all other religious institutions that have prayed and worked for three years for the preservation of religious freedom,\u201d Bishop Zubik said. \u201cWe are grateful that the justices will hear our case. And we continue to pray that the religious freedom of all people, which we treasure as our constitutional right, reinforced by Congress in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, will be upheld by the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nUnder the federal Affordable Care Act, most employers, including religious ones, are required to cover employees\u2019 artificial birth control, sterilization and abortifacients, even if employers are morally opposed to such coverage.\n\nIn all of the cases to be argued before the high court in March, appellate courts in various jurisdictions sided with the Obama administration. The rulings said the religious entities\u2019 freedom of religion was not burdened by having to comply with the mandate as they have argued, because the federal government has in place an accommodation, or \u201cwork around,\u201d for a third party to provide the contested coverage.\n\nThese employers must notify HHS in writing of their religious objections. Then HHS or the Department of Labor in turn tells insurers and third-party administrators that they must cover the services at no charge to employees. However, this accommodation does not provide a viable solution to those Catholic institutions or organizations that are self-insured, such as the Diocese of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe religious groups also object to that third-party notification, saying they still would be complicit in supporting practices they oppose.\n\nWhile their appeals worked their way to the high court, the government has not been able to force the groups to comply with the mandate or face daily fines for noncompliance.\n\nOnly those religious employers that meet narrow criteria set by the Obama administration are exempt from the mandate. Houses of worship are exempt, for example, but most religious employers such as social-service agencies are not.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://pittsburghcatholic.org/News/Supreme-Court-to-hear-Diocese-of-Pittsburgh-case-March-23-", "description": "WASHINGTON (CNS) \u2014 The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments March 23 in seven pending appeals in lawsuits brought by the Dioces ...", "title": "Supreme Court to hear Diocese of Pittsburgh case March 23 | Local and State News & Features | Pittsburgh Catholic Newspaper"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "However, this accommodation does not provide a viable solution to those Catholic institutions or organizations that are self-insured, such as the Diocese of Pittsburgh.\nHouses of worship are exempt, for example, but most religious employers such as social-service agencies are not.\nBishop David Zubik heads the Diocese of Pittsburgh and Sylvia Mathews Burwell is the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\nOnly those religious employers that meet narrow criteria set by the Obama administration are exempt from the mandate.\n\u201cThis is an extraordinary time for the Diocese of Pittsburgh and all other religious institutions that have prayed and worked for three years for the preservation of religious freedom,\u201d Bishop Zubik said."}
