The TNT analyst touched on topics big and small with president Barack Obama.

Charles Barkley might seem like an odd choice to interview Barack Obama, but TNT's sit down with the president brought forth some engaging answers on everything from basketball to healthcare.

Barkley started the interview with questions about how LeBron James compares to Michael Jordan, how often Obama is able to hoop and what it's like watching his daughter grow up with the game. Before the end, Barkely and the president were talking about real issues -- Obamacare, Michael Sam's impact on the country and a new program Obama is working on to help young black men find better jobs.

Obama, a noted Bulls fan, had plenty of praise for the two-time MVP James, but made sure his affection for MJ was also on the record.

"You know LeBron, I know LeBron," Obama said. "When you're standing next to him and then watch him close up, I've never seen someone that size, that fast, who can jump that high, who's that strong, who has that much basketball savvy all in one package. Now, I'm a Chicago guy, and Mike will always be the guy for me just because that was a magical moment for the city and he was a champion. But now that he's retired, LeBron, when you look at him, you think he might be able to play at a high level for another seven, eight, 10 years. He's 29 years old. In terms of every aspect of the game, LeBron has the chance to be as good as anyone."

Around the halfway point of the interview, Barkley's questions took on a more serious tone. He asked the president what he thought of the term "Obamacare." The president was blunt in his response.

"I like it," Obama said. "I don't mind. And I tell ya, five years from now, when everyone's saying, 'Man, I'm sure glad we got healthcare,' there's going to be a whole bunch of people who don't call it Obamacare anymore because they don't want me to get the credit. You don't know what life will throw at you. Sometimes people don't recognize, particularly young people, how important it is to have coverage until you get sick and you realize you may lose everything you have, or your parents may lose everything they have trying to make you well. So we're encouraging people to sign up. They've got until March 31 to sign up for this year."

The interview was thought-provoking the entire way through. Be sure to check out all of it.
