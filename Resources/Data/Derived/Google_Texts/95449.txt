The Republican Party should be more concerned with the emerging candidacy of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders rather than Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, says former House Speaker Newt Gingrich."If Hillary starts to implode you will see a vacuum that you have not seen in many, many years," Gingrich said Monday on Fox News Channel's "On the Record with Greta Van Susteren." A large number of egos could be pulled into the race if Clinton's email scandal does her candidacy in, Gingrich said."[Former New York City mayor Michael] Bloomberg, if he shifts. [California Gov.] Jerry Brown, you just don't know. [Massachusetts Sen.] Elizabeth Warren," he said."I'm sure that John Kerry is waiting for his Nobel Prize speech and will then promptly announce to run."The email scandal is part of an "attrition process" that will eventually doom Clinton, Gringrich said.Her joke about Snapchat making her posts go away instantly shows "she doesn't have any common sense about dealing with this stuff," he said.Democrats, and eventually Republicans, need to worry about Sanders because "if he keeps running, and he keeps gaining momentum, and he keeps gaining supporters, there is a morning where he, in fact, becomes genuinely formidable," Gingrich said."This is a party which likes socialism. It's a party which likes his very dovish foreign policy. I don't think it's impossible to imagine Sanders being the Democratic nominee."On the Republican side, front-runner Donald Trump continues to be the one to beat, Gingrich said."The other candidates have to face the reality if he stays at 25 [percent in the polls] or better, he wins," he said.Trump is like a science fiction film where no matter how many hits he takes he keeps getting bigger, Gingrich said. "You are dealing with somebody who is totally different from anybody in modern politics."
