An unidentified suspect traveling in a car on eastbound U.S. 36 shot a man in another car Friday night, causing the injured driver to crash his car near an overpass, police say.

The name of the victim, who ran from the wrecked car to a nearby house for help, has not been released, according to a news release by Investigator Wayne Read of the Westminster Police Department.

The victim was taken to a hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound, but his condition was not released.

No one has been caught, and no description of the suspect and the vehicle he was in is available.

The crash happened at about 8:30 p.m. on U.S. 36 near the West 80th Avenue overpass, Read said.

About 10 minutes later, a homeowner called police saying that a man had come to their door bleeding from what the victim said was a gunshot wound.

The home is a few blocks from where the accident happened.

Police would later learn that the man was the only one in his car when he was shot and crashed. The investigation indicated that someone from another vehicle had fired his gun at the victim.

Police are still investigating the circumstances of the shooting, Read said.

U.S. 36 was closed for about two hours during the investigation.

“We are aware the community may be concerned about the circumstances of this shooting,” Read wrote in his news release. “Therefore, we want to reassure the public this was a vehicle-to-vehicle incident.”

Authorities are asking anyone who may have information regarding this shooting to call the Westminster Police Department at 303-658-4360.
