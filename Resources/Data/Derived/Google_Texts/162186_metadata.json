After its Communist leader repeatedly quoted Ho Chi Minh, Obama went to his own anti-American talking points.\n\nFor you, that conflict was a bitter memory. But today, Vietnam and America show the world that hearts can change and peace is possible. And we thank Secretary Kerry and all our veterans here today, both Vietnamese and American, who had the courage not only to fight, but, more importantly, had the courage to make peace. I think oftentimes our veterans can show us the way. One American veteran came here and described meeting a former North Vietnamese soldier. \u201cHe came up and shook my hand, and now we\u2019re friends,\u201d this veteran said. \u201cWithout the high-powered politicians, people can just get along as human beings.\u201d\n\nIt's clever of Obama to put his agenda in the mouth of some unnamed veteran even while suggesting that American veterans died and were wounded in Vietnam for nothing.\n\nObama not only fails to acknowledge their sacrifice, but he effectively erases it and replaces it with a Zinnian insistence that the Vietnam War was the work of politicians. But then when you form common cause with Communists, you can't acknowledge that Communism might be an aggressive and murderous ideology. And that fighting it might be justified.\n\nObama dismisses the \"courage to fight\" and replaces it with the \"courage to make peace\" which is more important. The only Vietnam War veterans worth honoring are appeasers like Kerry.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "general", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Frontpage Mag", "title": "Obama in Vietnam: Vietnam War was Caused by US Politicians", "url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/262941/obama-vietnam-vietnam-war-was-caused-us-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/05/whitehouseobamanam.jpg?itok=u1LzEZkZ", "updated_time": "2016-05-23T15:11:19-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/point/262941/obama-vietnam-vietnam-war-was-caused-us-daniel-greenfield", "image": "http://www.frontpagemag.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_full/public/uploads/2016/05/whitehouseobamanam.jpg?itok=u1LzEZkZ", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama in Vietnam: Vietnam War was Caused by US Politicians"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-23T15:11:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T15:11:19-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The only Vietnam War veterans worth honoring are appeasers like Kerry.\nObama not only fails to acknowledge their sacrifice, but he effectively erases it and replaces it with a Zinnian insistence that the Vietnam War was the work of politicians.\nBut today, Vietnam and America show the world that hearts can change and peace is possible.\nObama dismisses the \"courage to fight\" and replaces it with the \"courage to make peace\" which is more important.\nOne American veteran came here and described meeting a former North Vietnamese soldier."}
