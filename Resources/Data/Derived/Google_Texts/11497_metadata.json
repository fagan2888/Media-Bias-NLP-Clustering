The House Judiciary Committee passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.B. 4588) Friday afternoon on a voice vote.\n\nNow that H.B. 4588 is out of Judiciary, the bill will go to the House floor for first, second, and third readings. After a favorable vote (and it should pass by an overwhelming margin), the bill will be sent to the Senate.\n\nAll week long pro-lifers around the state have been following the progress of H.B. 4588. Initially a Discharge Motion to bring the bill directly to the floor of the House for a vote (which took place February 11, the day of the annual Pro-Life Rally) failed on a tie vote. But six days later the bill was swiftly passed by voice vote through the House Health Committee. Then Friday afternoon, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act passed on a voice vote in the Judiciary Committee.\n\nHowever, time is not on our side. But with your help, the bill will get to the Senate by February 26, the last day for a bill to cross over.\n\nH.B. 4588, will protect West Virginia\u2019s unborn babies who can feel pain from a gruesome death by dismemberment or other horrific late abortion techniques. Substantial medical evidence demonstrates the baby\u2019s ability to feel pain is present by 20 weeks.\n\nWe know that pro-life legislation saves lives. We know that every year legislators don\u2019t pass pro-life legislation, precious little babies die.\n\nContact your state Senators and ask them to support the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.
