How many years have you been in the St. Vrain Valley? 13

What brought you here? What has kept you here? My family lives here and I was born here.

If you could design a robot that could do anything, what would that robot do? I saw a demonstration of a humanoid robot that was programmed to work with kids with special needs such as autism, and I thought that something like that would be interesting to work with. For next year in robotics at school, though, I would like to learn how to program line sensors on the robot to sense lines that are taped down on our playing field so it can score more easily.

Who inspires you to work hard in school, and why? I want to do my best in everything, so a lot of times I make myself work hard. I also like to keep up with or go further than my friends, so they help me do my best that way. My dad encourages me to learn more about the subjects than what I learn in school, too, and he helps me with that, particularly in math.

What's the biggest worry or concern in your life right now? I don't know.

What gives you joy? I enjoy reading and writing.
