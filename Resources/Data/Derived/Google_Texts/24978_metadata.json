Halbert\n\nFORECASTS & TRENDS E-LETTER\n\nby Gary D. Halbert\n\nSeptember 25, 2014\n\n[This post is from my weekly BETWEEN THE LINES blog, but I thought it important enough to send to my E-Letter subscribers as well. -GDH]\n\nMost Americans probably never heard of or don\u2019t remember the name Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel. He was one of the chief architects of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\u201cObamaCare\u201d) from the very beginning.\n\nIf you remember his name at all, it may be because of his brother Rahm Emanuel, the beleaguered mayor of Chicago, former White House Chief of Staff in President Obama\u2019s first term and former member of the House of Representatives.\n\nWhile Dr. \u201cZeke\u201d Emanuel no longer works for the Obama administration, he nonetheless made news recently with his controversial editorial entitled \u201cWhy I Hope to Die at 75.\u201d This editorial was first published in The Atlantic online magazine on September 17.\n\nThen on Monday, September 22, Dr. Emanuel appeared on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d program hosted by Joe Scarborough. It was then that Dr. Emanuel\u2019s controversial views hit the national stage \u2013 sort of (many in the mainstream media have not touched it).\n\nLet me summarize Dr. Emanuel\u2019s latest argument for all of us.\n\nBasically, Dr. Emanuel (age 57) says that once he reaches the age of 75, he will forego all medical treatment and diagnostic tests and let nature run its course. \u201cSEVENTY-FIVE. That\u2019s how long I want to live: 75 years.\u201d You might be thinking, \u201cSo what?\u201d Who cares what some liberal kook may be saying?\n\n\u201cI picked 75, when you think about the combination of physical decline, the rise of Alzheimer\u2019s, the loss of creativity. And I really say you need to think about what you\u2019re going to leave your children, your family, your community, the country.\u201d\n\nEmanuel contends that his decision to forego medical treatment after age 75 is a \u201cpersonal decision.\u201d However, there is no question in my mind that he is raising this issue \u2013 that the government should consider the idea of ending healthcare at age 75 \u2013 to a level of national discourse in the ongoing evolution of ObamaCare.\n\nEmanuel has long advocated for government-run healthcare. While he was one of the chief architects of ObamaCare, he actually believes in a \u201csingle-payer\u201d healthcare system in which the federal government is the sole arbiter of all medical treatment \u2013 but with a cruel twist!\n\nThe former doctor argued in his editorial and his Morning Joe appearance that 75 years is long enough for a person to live, saying that\u2019s about the time when our health begins to decline.\n\nIn his morbid scenario, people would not receive healthcare and medical treatment beyond age 75 and would simply be allowed to die from disease or natural causes. He argues that the lion\u2019s share of healthcare expenses are spent on those age 75 or older, which is true.\n\nTo really understand what is behind Emanuel\u2019s warped motivation, we need to focus on this particular statement that was highlighted above:\n\n\u201c\u2026 you need to think about what you\u2019re going to leave your children,\n\nyour family, your community, the country.\u201d [Emphasis added.]\n\nTranslated differently, this means that if you live too long and exhaust all your assets, then your life is viewed as a net total loss by the government, since you will have paid little or no estate taxes, and will have maxed-out all of your entitlement benefits.\n\nThink about that for a moment.\n\nWhereas if you die early enough, your estate has something to pass along in the way of taxes, etc. and you will have had substantially less impact on government entitlement programs.\n\nWhen Obamacare was being debated, there were fears of \u201cdeath panels.\u201d In Emanuel\u2019s scenario, the government wouldn\u2019t need them.\n\nThis is the disgusting message that Dr. Emanuel has entered into the public debate over healthcare. The question is, why now? Why just before the mid-term elections? Does it hurt Democrats up for re-election? Did the White House know about this?\n\nEmanuel admits in his editorial that his wife, his children, his brothers and his friends are upset with him over his decision to forego healthcare and medical treatment at age 75. So why do this so publicly? Especially when you were one of the original architects of ObamaCare.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of bad stuff going on in the world today that people are worried about, so maybe this bombshell from Dr. Emanuel doesn\u2019t have \u201clegs.\u201d Maybe it will soon be forgotten. I don\u2019t know, but I doubt we\u2019ve heard the last of it.
