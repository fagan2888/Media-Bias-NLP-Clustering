Adventist Health System will pay $115 million to the U.S. Department of Justice to settle claims it offered doctors perks for patient referrals, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reports.

The lawsuit, filed in December 2012, involves Adventist hospitals in Volusia and Flagler Counties, according to the News-Journal. The Justice Department joined the whistleblower case filed by three former Adventist employees in North Carolina.

The settlement also resolved claims that Adventist, the parent company of Florida Hospital, overbilled for Medicare, reports the News-Journal.
