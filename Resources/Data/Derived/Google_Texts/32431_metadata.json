It was backordered, and we couldn\u2019t get it in the store until December 29th.\n\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to get my wife?\u201d a man demanded. \u201cThat\u2019s what she wanted.\u201d\n\nGet her another book, I wanted to suggest, but instead I apologized from my perch behind the counter, explaining that the publisher hadn\u2019t printed enough copies.\n\n\u201cI want to support local bookstores, but you people are really making me want to go to Amazon,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe book is backordered on Amazon too,\u201d I told him, as politely as I could. \u201cThey can\u2019t get it to you before Christmas either.\u201d\n\nNothing about this conversation was unusual. Customers regularly threaten booksellers with Amazon, like it\u2019s a weapon they can deploy to get what they want from us. \u201cI could get this much cheaper on Amazon,\u201d people tell me when checking out.\n\nThese book buyers want to feel good about themselves for shopping in a bookstore, but they want special credit for it too, as if the bookstore should give out gold star stickers along with receipts. People love the ease, anonymity and convenience of shopping on Amazon, but many do feel guilty about shopping for books online \u2013 we know bookstores are where real live authors hold events and where little kids can go to a story hour on Saturdays. We know that the money spent in bookstores sustains a lively town center; it doesn\u2019t go to buy Jeff Bezos another rocket ship.\n\nSo readers congratulate themselves when they make it to a bookstore, but are annoyed when it\u2019s not a perfect transaction. The books are more expensive than they are online, and sometimes there\u2019s a line to check out (only during the two weeks before Christmas, really). And man, do customers hate waiting in line. I remember waiting in the Borders line forever during the holidays years ago, my arms full of books and CDs, but people get annoyed if there\u2019s a line in the bookstore now, asking why we don\u2019t have a third cash register. We have become a culture that refuses to wait for books.\n\nOnce, I had a customer come in and say: \u201cI\u2019m parked illegally, so can you check me out and also giftwrap the book as fast as possible?\u201d Another customer yelled at my coworker because she got a parking ticket while shopping, as if booksellers are in cahoots with parking enforcement.\n\nWe want shopping in person to be as quick and easy as shopping online is. It is not, and last year, during the holiday rush, I began to understand the value of this slowness.\n\n*\n\nI took a job at my local bookstore in order to supplement money I earned from a fellowship, but bookselling quickly became something much more than rent money to me. It was a job I\u2019d been training for my entire life, a job that required knowing more about books than the average person. I had always read more and read faster than most people I knew. But no one can read everything, and in my years as a bookseller, I\u2019ve learned to listen to NPR in the morning because someone will almost always come in later that day wanting a book that they heard about on the way to work. I remember one customer in particular: \u201cI don\u2019t know the author or the title, but it has something to do with World War II and love letters.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard that on the radio too,\u201d I told him, and went off to fetch the book.\n\nI had other customers get so excited when I found the book they wanted based only on some very vague descriptions (\u201cBlue cover, I think it\u2019s about Italy?\u201d) that they hugged me.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s cool about that\u2014the blue cover, Italy thing\u2014is that\u2019s really hard for a computer,\u201d my husband told me. He studies artificial intelligence, and he loves Amazon. Other than the fact that I\u2019d complain about it, I don\u2019t think he would miss bookstores much if they were gone.\n\nWhat he doesn\u2019t seem to understand is the thing I\u2019ve come to learn: There are people who really need bookstores, people who I have come to know well. There\u2019s the elderly woman who comes to every reading and sits in the front row. A professor visits in the afternoon to tell dirty jokes and he often brings challah to share. There is a therapist who works next door, and he buys and reads more novels than I would think is humanly possible or financially responsible. When one of our booksellers was snowed in overnight at work, the therapist let her sleep on his couch. There is a man who wears a leather cowboy hat, and he told me he almost never leaves his apartment except to come into the store. He always tips his hat to me before he leaves (really). And every Saturday, a father and his young son come in to buy a new Geronimo Stilton book, which is a series about an adventurous mouse. I eventually learned that the father was going through a divorce, and the bookstore was one of the things that both he and the little boy really looked forward to.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I forswore Amazon and took a job at a local bookstore to make rent; it became something much more than a paycheck", "author": "Annie Hartnett", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "I forswore Amazon and took a job at a local bookstore to make rent; it became something much more than a paycheck", "title": "We\u2019re more than confirmation numbers: What I learned selling books to strangers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/26/were_more_than_confirmation_numbers_what_i_learned_selling_books_to_strangers/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/bookstore_shopper.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I forswore Amazon and took a job at a local bookstore to make rent; it became something much more than a paycheck", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/bookstore_shopper.jpg", "title": "We\u2019re more than confirmation numbers: What I learned selling books to strangers", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "We\u2019re more than confirmation numbers: What I learned selling books to strangers", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, amazon, Christmas, Editor's Pick, Life stories", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI want to support local bookstores, but you people are really making me want to go to Amazon,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe book is backordered on Amazon too,\u201d I told him, as politely as I could.\nCustomers regularly threaten booksellers with Amazon, like it\u2019s a weapon they can deploy to get what they want from us.\nThe books are more expensive than they are online, and sometimes there\u2019s a line to check out (only during the two weeks before Christmas, really).\nIt was a job I\u2019d been training for my entire life, a job that required knowing more about books than the average person."}
