In light of troubling remarks by Dr. Gruber and MNsure, I believe that a review of Dr. Gruber\u2019s work, and payments made to him, is necessary.\u201d\n\nOn December 9, Davids sent a second letter to Swanson.\n\n\u201cEarlier today,\u201d Davids wrote, \u201cin testimony before Congressional investigators, Dr. Jonathan Gruber refused to answer questions regarding compensation for his work with state-based insurance exchanges. The evasiveness displayed by Dr. Gruber reinforces my concerns expressed in the previous letter.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo date,\u201d Davids told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement on Wednesday, \u201cI have received word via phone call that the Attorney General\u2019s office was working on a response, but nothing in writing yet.\u201d\n\nDavids blasted Gruber\u2019s projections for the state of Minnesota about enrollment for the state\u2019s health care exchange, MNSure, when it launched.\n\n\u201cMNsure, Dr. Gruber and Governor Dayton\u2019s Administration repeatedly guaranteed that the exchange would serve 1.3 million Minnesotans by 2016, including over 600,000 in commercial plans \u2013 a financial necessity to avoid a taxpayer bailout,\u201d Davids told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cThose projections were so far off that it has proved absurd,\u201d Davids said.\n\n\u201cInstead of 500,000 private enrollees by the end of 2015, MNsure has repeatedly lowered Dr. Gruber\u2019s projections and now estimates that fewer than 70,000 will enroll in private plans by the end of next year,\u201d Davids added.\n\n\u201cThe error rate for Dr. Gruber\u2019s work is beyond laughable,\u201d Davids stated.\n\n\u201cIt is a shame,\u201d Davids continued, \u201cthat nearly $600,000 in public funds was used for projections that were inaccurate from the moment MNsure opened. The Dayton Administration has essentially used over $150 million in taxpayer money to build a broken IT system for public health programs.\u201d\n\nDavids, who has served in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 1991, is scheduled to become Chairman of the powerful House Taxes Committee in January.\n\n\u201cThere has been little to no transparency in Dr. Gruber\u2019s work with MNsure,\u201d Davids told Breitbart News. \u201cGiven that Dr. Gruber missed the deadline to submit his final report by four months \u2013 thereby avoiding scrutiny during the legislative process that led to MNsure\u2019s creation \u2013 it is sadly unsurprising that he may have failed to live up to other aspects of his taxpayer-funded contract,\u201d Davids concluded.\n\nA Breitbart investigation into the state of Minnesota\u2019s 2011 contract in which Gruber was paid $329,000 as a subcontractor to develop economic projections using his proprietary Gruber Microsimulation Model has uncovered a disturbing pattern of billing practices that indicate a lack of oversight. April Todd-Malmlov, the former executive director of MNSure, the state\u2019s Obamacare health exchange, was the official responsible for that oversight.\n\nBreitbart obtained copies of the Gruber invoices, the contract, and the Gruber subcontract in a public records request filed with the state of Minnesota.\n\nThough the contract, which was signed by former executive director Todd-Malmlov, clearly specifies that all Gruber\u2019s invoices should be itemized in detail, the invoices submitted by Gruber and paid by the state of Minnesota were notably lacking in itemization.\n\nGruber\u2019s invoices do not specifically tie to deliverables specified in the contract other than to assert vaguely that some of them were delivered. The invoices do not consistently refer to the deliverables specified in the contract, nor, with the exception of the final report, do they specify the dates the deliverables were completed, to whom they were delivered in the state of Minnesota, nor whether they were formally accepted by specific bureaucrats in the state of Minnesota.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, former executive director Todd-Malmov authorized all of Gruber\u2019s interim payments as well as his final payment.\n\nGruber delivered two final reports, one in 2012 and one in 2013, each about 60 pages long. Todd-Malmlov formally certified her acceptance of both these reports.\n\nBut records obtained by Breitbart News from the state of Minnesota indicate there is no auditable trail for the work product that resulted in those final reports.\n\nIn addition, Gruber\u2019s invoices do not track specifically to the deliverables identified in Exhibit B of the contract. The deliverables in that exhibit are labeled Deliverable A, Deliverable B, Deliverable C, and Deliverable D. None of Gruber\u2019s invoices refer to Deliverable A, Deliverable B, Deliverable C, or Deliverable D.\n\nThe Gruber invoice that potentially aligns with Deliverable B is cryptic at best in describing what was delivered. The Gruber invoice that potentially aligns with Deliverable C actually does not match what is specified as Deliverable C in the contract. Only the final Gruber invoice\u2013which refers to the final report referenced in Deliverable D\u2013 tracks with any degree of specificity to the contract.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Minnesota State Representative Greg Davids is calling for embattled MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber, the", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Minnesota State Representative Greg Davids is calling for embattled MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber, the", "title": "MN State Rep Wants $329,000 Refund from Jonathan Gruber for Work With 'Beyond Laughable' Error Rates - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Obamacare/obamacare_get_covered_reuters.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-17T22:08:34-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/12/17/minnesota-state-rep-wants-329-000-refund-from-gruber-for-work-with-beyond-laughable-error-rates/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Minnesota State Representative Greg Davids is calling for embattled MIT economics professor Jonathan Gruber, the", "title": "MN State Rep Wants $329,000 Refund from Jonathan Gruber for Work With 'Beyond Laughable' Error Rates - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2013/Obamacare/obamacare_get_covered_reuters.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2014-12-17T16:36:58-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-17T22:08:34-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe03db\"", "article_summary": "Breitbart obtained copies of the Gruber invoices, the contract, and the Gruber subcontract in a public records request filed with the state of Minnesota.\n\u201cThe error rate for Dr. Gruber\u2019s work is beyond laughable,\u201d Davids stated.\n\u201cThere has been little to no transparency in Dr. Gruber\u2019s work with MNsure,\u201d Davids told Breitbart News.\nOnly the final Gruber invoice\u2013which refers to the final report referenced in Deliverable D\u2013 tracks with any degree of specificity to the contract.\nIn addition, Gruber\u2019s invoices do not track specifically to the deliverables identified in Exhibit B of the contract."}
