Daneya Esgar, D-Pueblo.\n\nThe proposal would limit total barrel size to 100 gallons per residence. Proponents say that the average homeowner could collect about 600 gallons of water annually to water their lawns or gardens.\n\nThat amount of water could sustain a vegetable garden or a flower bed, according to Drew Beckwith, water policy manager for Western Resource Advocates, who testified for the legislation.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important things this bill accomplishes is putting urban and suburban water users in the mind frame of conservation,\u201d said co-sponsor Rep. Jessie Danielson, D-Wheat Ridge.\n\nEsgar said people already use rain barrels and were shocked to find out it\u2019s illegal. Beckwith said Colorado is the only state to prohibit residential collection of rain.\n\nColorado\u2019s water rights system \u2014 known as \u201cfirst in time, first in right\u201d \u2014 emerged during the mining booms of the 19th century. Using that rhetoric, people argue that collecting rainwater prevents it from reaching rivers, violating the rights of downstream users.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a violation of the doctrine of prior appropriations,\u201d said Pat Ratliff of the South Metro Water Authority. \u201cIt\u2019s not their water (to use). It\u2019s a return flow that somebody downstream has a senior right to.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rooftop rainwater collection bill easily clears Colorado committee", "title": "Rooftop rainwater collection bill easily clears Colorado committee", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/16/rooftop-rainwater-collection-bill-easily-clears-colorado-committee/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150316__denver-colorado-rainp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150316__denver-colorado-rainp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-16T16:44:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T15:37:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Water"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd4dd\"", "article_summary": "A bill that would allow residential rainwater collection sailed through a committee hearing Monday, making headway in Colorado\u2019s decades-old water rights battle.\nColorado\u2019s water rights system \u2014 known as \u201cfirst in time, first in right\u201d \u2014 emerged during the mining booms of the 19th century.\nProponents say that the average homeowner could collect about 600 gallons of water annually to water their lawns or gardens.\nHouse Bill 1259 passed the Agriculture, Livestock & Natural Resources Committee 8-5 and now advances to the full House.\nUsing that rhetoric, people argue that collecting rainwater prevents it from reaching rivers, violating the rights of downstream users."}
