He spent 25 years at Goldman Sachs, then launched his own investment firm, Omega Advisors.\n\nThe donation will fund construction of the Livingston medical center\u2019s new west wing. There, the Cooperman Family Pavilion will include a new neonatal intensive care unit, three floors of private rooms, with the ground floor offering easy access to outpatient cardiac vascular, pulmonary and other diagnostic services.\n\nThe Coopermans are among the group of 120 or so people who have taken the Warren Buffett Giving Pledge. That pledge, devised by the Omaha billionaire, encourages the wealthy to decide how much of their fortune they truly need, then to give away the rest.\n\n\n\nIn a September, 2011 letter to Buffett, Cooperman wrote that he and his wife were \u201centhusiastically\u201d taking the pledge to donate the majority of their personal wealth to charity.\n\nThey quoted Winston Churchill, who said, \"We make a living by what we get, but we make a life by what we give.\"\n\n\n\nThe former Short Hills residents have long been active in other charitable work as well. Toby Cooperman was a special education specialist at the Early Childhood Learning Center in Chatham, and on the board of the JCC Metrowest, Jewish Services for the Developmentally Disabled, and Jespy House, along with other organizations.\n\nLeon Cooperman has been affiliated with Barnabas for more than three decades, first as a trustee and later as chairman of the medical center\u2019s foundation.\n\n\u201cWe are exceptionally grateful,\u201d said Barry Ostrowsky, president of Barnabas Health, of the record donation.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@river','health-news'", "title": "Saint Barnabas receives record $25 million donation", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Saint Barnabas receives record $25 million donation\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/04/saint_barnabas_receives_record_25_million_donation.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/04/14655241-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12610134\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-04-08T16:51:27Z\", \"author\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"tags\": [\"@river\",\"health-news\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/04/14655241-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@OBrienLedger", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Toby and Leon Cooperman have donated a record $25 to Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston."}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, April 08, 2014,  2:43 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2014/04/barnabas-coopermanjpg-a91fd01ea852f7d9.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"kobrien\", \"author_nickname\": \"Kathleen O\\u0027Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\", \"author_id\": \"2434\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Toby and Leon Cooperman have donated a record $25 to Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston.", "title": "Saint Barnabas receives record $25 million donation", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2014/04/saint_barnabas_receives_record_25_million_donation.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, April 08, 2014, 12:49 PM", "article_author": "Kathleen O'Brien | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "Description": "Toby and Leon Cooperman have donated a record $25 to Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8c87\"", "article_summary": "St. Barnabas Medical Center has received the largest donation in its history -- $25 million -- courtesy of a plumber\u2019s son and his wife.\nLeon Cooperman has been affiliated with Barnabas for more than three decades, first as a trustee and later as chairman of the medical center\u2019s foundation.\n\u201cWe are exceptionally grateful,\u201d said Barry Ostrowsky, president of Barnabas Health, of the record donation.\nThe donation will fund construction of the Livingston medical center\u2019s new west wing.\nThat someone from such a humble background could be in a position to make so large a donation is proof of the American dream, said Leon and Toby Cooperman in the announcement about their donation."}
