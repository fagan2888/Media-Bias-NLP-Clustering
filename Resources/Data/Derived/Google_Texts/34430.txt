Watch: Syrian refugees in Germany complain about slow internet speeds

There is an ironic phrase much in fashion these days, used to trivialize problems that people complain about. Just call it a “white people problem,” or its variant, “first world problem.” Things like slow internet, expensive pro sports tickets, or any of the other things that bother what Hillary Clinton calls “everyday people.” Which makes it passing strange that these so-called “Syrian refugees” interviewed by Russia’s RT television complain about slow internet speeds, not having enough money to buy cigarettes, and food that’s fit only for a dog or a woman.

Of course, the Koran teaches that Muslims are entitled to the fruit of infidels’ labors simply because they are Muslims. So maybe these complaints are quite justifiable in their minds. Hat tip: The Right Scoop
