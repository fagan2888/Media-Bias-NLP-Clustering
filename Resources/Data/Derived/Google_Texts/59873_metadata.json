It made several temporary tax cuts permanent.\n\nCorrupt politicians love temporary tax cuts \u2014 they can demand campaign contributions every two years to \u201cextend\u201d lower taxes. Now, the politicians who sold temporary tax credits are out of business.\n\nLiberals hate the permanent tax cuts. This means less opportunity for corruption and $580 billion in lower taxes over the next 10 years.\n\nThe spending interests demand that any reduction in your tax burden be \u201cpaid for.\u201d What does that mean? Lower taxes means you have more of the money you earned left with you and your family.\n\nWhen the pols raise gas taxes or excise taxes, you have less take-home pay. Do the newspapers care enough to ask what your family will go without this year and future years because of higher taxes?\n\nNo, the left focuses only on the desires of big government. Government could \u201cpay for\u201d tax cuts by reducing spending. We pay hundreds of millions in taxes to pay for the sugar subsidy program. We paid at least $733 million to subsidize Obamacare exchanges that went bankrupt. And Solyndra. And gold-plated pensions for government workers who also have permanent jobs. Tenure.\n\nWe can reduce deficit spending. By spending less.\n\nIn 2011 Congress put a ceiling on spending that \u2014 despite Democrats\u2019 objections \u2014 has already saved hundreds of billions. This year, the Republican Congress agreed to permanently pay for doctors\u2019 reimbursement in Medicare. (That cost $150 billion over a decade in higher spending.) In return it reformed the Medicare system to save $3 trillion in spending \u2014 net present value today. President Obama signed the bill that reduced future deficits by $2.85 trillion.\n\nState and national taxes should be reduced and \u201cpaid for\u201d by reducing the cost of government. The GOP House has five times passed the Paul Ryan budget plan to reform entitlements without tax hikes.\n\nRaising taxes is what politicians do instead of reforming government to cost less. No mas.\n\nGrover Norquist, @GroverNorquist, is president of Americans for Tax Reform.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1YNYjRU", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Liberals hate the permanent tax cuts, writes Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "Liberals hate the permanent tax cuts, writes Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.", "title": "Grover Norquist: Reduce taxes and spend less", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/12/28/tax-cuts-congress-grover-norquist-editorials-debates/77989430/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Liberals hate the permanent tax cuts, writes Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.", "title": "Grover Norquist: Reduce taxes and spend less", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/28d23b0bd6bc7277b7eefa40fb211ba7a96e9a98/c=175-0-912-737&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635869208270229504-OPPOSE.JPG", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Tax cuts", "gci-asset-type": "Story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Tax cuts", "title": "Grover Norquist: Reduce taxes and spend less", "author": "Grover Norquist", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/611b01dd0efed0cde3629384071c834743e4129c/c=321-0-874-737/local/-/media/2015/12/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635869208270229504-OPPOSE.JPG", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3e800186890c6bae85b7b6be4541332051e485e0/c=175-0-912-737/local/-/media/2015/12/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635869208270229504-OPPOSE.JPG", "contenttype": "Story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e16cc3abee52cd7b18749074a55b017bf0d6043a/c=22-0-1002-737/local/-/media/2015/12/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635869208270229504-OPPOSE.JPG", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f99defc983dbe09c02d43e3c9b99a06b3c360698/c=0-25-1022-602&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635869208270229504-OPPOSE.JPG", "publishtime": "2015-12-28T18:23:00.213000-05:00", "shorthed": "Grover Norquist: Reduce taxes and spend less", "articleid": 77989430, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f216028bcb5f48ee866d3e02660b94f34002668/c=0-25-1022-602/local/-/media/2015/12/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635869208270229504-OPPOSE.JPG", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/878cdcd3bdec4167df0f6315c35593d67cb4c2f1/c=463-0-876-737/local/-/media/2015/12/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635869208270229504-OPPOSE.JPG"}}, "news_keywords": "taxes, Congress, tax cuts, big government, federal budget, Grover Norquist, Americans for Tax Reform, editorials, debates,"}, "article_summary": "Corrupt politicians love temporary tax cuts \u2014 they can demand campaign contributions every two years to \u201cextend\u201d lower taxes.\nThis means less opportunity for corruption and $580 billion in lower taxes over the next 10 years.\nLower taxes means you have more of the money you earned left with you and your family.\nIt made several temporary tax cuts permanent.\nWhen the pols raise gas taxes or excise taxes, you have less take-home pay."}
