They help them with therapy, taking their medications, learning social skills and personal hygiene. They cope with difficult behavior that can include violent tantrums and outbursts.\n\nAnd then, just as the boys have gotten used to the caregivers, they leave.\n\nThe VanderWeysts have gone through 14 PCAs in five years. Many have gone on to school or higher-paying jobs that don\u2019t require such tough work. For a special needs child, the transition between can be extremely difficult.\n\n\u201cFor a child, especially a child with autism, they need to learn to trust,\u201d Marie VanderWeyst said. \u201cAbout the time that they trust that person, they bail.\u201d\n\nMinnesota is facing a shortage of home- and community-based caregivers, who provide direct care for people with physical, mental and developmental disabilities and the elderly at home, in group homes and supervised work centers.\n\nThe jobs usually require only a high school degree and little or no experience. But they also pay low wages \u2014 about $11 an hour, not far above the state\u2019s minimum wage of $9 an hour. Providers say the low wages are hurting their ability to find and retain employees, leading to vacant positions and high turnover.\n\nA coalition of advocacy groups is pushing to increase state reimbursements for providers of home- and community-based services, which affect about 73,000 people with disabilities and 35,000 older adults in Minnesota. They plan to rally Tuesday at the Capitol in St. Paul\n\nBuy Photo Direct Support Professional Jarred Buller, center, smiles as he talks to clients and makes his rounds on a line of WACOSA workers making lighting assemblies for freezers Friday morning, April 8, in Waite Park.

The worker shortage is starting to be felt by group homes that don\u2019t have enough staff to get residents out into the community, and by staff working long overtime hours.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just creating stress across the whole system,\u201d Larson said.\n\nBills have cleared committees in both the House and Senate that would increase state reimbursements for home and community-based providers and would require most of the funds to be dedicated to wages. The House bill was amended to a 7 percent increase.\n\nDespite some bipartisan support, the effort to boost funding faces stiff competition at the Capitol as lawmakers debate what to do with a $900 million budget surplus. There\u2019s also pressure to cut taxes and to spend on other priorities such as transportation and early childhood education. The 5 percent rate increase has an estimated cost of $95 million for fiscal year 2017 and $232 million for the 2018-19 biennium.\n\nSome St. Cloud-area legislators are co-authors of the 5 percent legislation, including Rep. Tim O\u2019Driscoll, R-Sartell. O\u2019Driscoll noted that over the last several years, there have been several different \u201c5 percent\u201d campaigns at the Legislature, including a bump in funding for nursing homes. As the population begins to age, the demand for such services will continue to rise, he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a group of people we need to help support in our community,\u201d O\u2019Driscoll said.\n\nREM Central Lakes has about 40 group homes around the St. Cloud area that provide housing and care for people with cognitive disabilities, mental health issues and brain injuries. The company has 489 direct care staff, but could employ up to 600, said David Lyons, area director.\n\nThe staff work directly with clients, helping them with hygiene, eating, medications, financial support and community activities. It can be difficult work, especially with clients who have behavioral issues or higher needs, Lyons said. With the typical starting wage of $10 an hour, finding quality, caring, motivated employees can be a problem.\n\n\"When you\u2019re working with other humans, you have to be able to provide a certain amount of compassion,\u201d Lyons said.\n\nSt. Cloud benefits from having college students who can fill some direct care positions, said Cindy Owen, director of the nonprofit The Arc Midstate, based in Waite Park. However, the jobs are often a stepping stone, creating a revolving door.\n\nPeople often don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be expected of them when they start a direct care job, Owen said.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a heart for it, you\u2019re not going to last,\u201d she said.\n\nBuy Photo Personal caregiver Rachel Wallece takes Elliott Gilbert, 8, for a wagon ride after school Wednesday, April 13, on the sidewalk by his home.

But she added. \"no one is ever going to take these jobs for money.\"\n\nOn a Friday morning at the nonprofit WACOSA\u2019s Waite Park work center, people with developmental disabilities sit along tables and assemble light bulbs for the appliance company Electrolux. Staff walk around and talk to the workers, making sure each has enough light bulbs and helping with any other needs they might have.\n\nDirect care workers are \u201cthe lifeblood of what we do,\u201d said Steve Howard, WACOSA\u2019s executive director.\n\n\u201cWithout them, we don\u2019t function,\u201d he said. Yet, the nonprofit has had difficulty keeping people in the positions, which pay an average of $11.33 an hour.\n\nEvery time the minimum wage is raised, it pushes closer to what the direct care workers earn, Howard said. And because 80 percent of WACOSA\u2019s funding comes from the Medicaid waiver, it\u2019s limited in how much it can raise pay, he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where it\u2019s becoming very, very challenging,\u201d Howard said.\n\nThe direct care workers provide whatever level of assistance the WACOSA clients need, Howard said. For some, that might be supporting them as they work at a job in the community. For those who are less independent, it might mean helping someone eat or go to the bathroom.\n\nMeanwhile, someone can earn $14 an hour making sandwiches at Jimmy John\u2019s, Howard said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re competing with those places,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the money that they\u2019re earning, I think some folks are deciding it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d\n\nMiranda and Zach Gilbert of St. Cloud know that firsthand. Their 8-year-old son, Elliott, has Fragile X syndrome, a genetic condition that causes developmental delays and sometimes deformities.\n\nA personal care assistant comes about 20 hours a week during the summer and less frequently during the school year to help Elliott with dressing, communicating and working on writing, reading, math and large motor skills.\n\nThe family has used a company called Arise Home Health Care to find the PCAs. But in the last three years, they\u2019ve gone through four.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been able to keep them,\u201d Miranda Gilbert said.\n\nBuy Photo Personal caregiver Rachel Wallece plays with Elliott Gilbert , 8, after school Wednesday, April 13. (Photo: Jason Wachter, jwachter@stcloudtimes.com)\n\nThe workers have moved onto different positions or gone back to school, she said. Although some have wanted to stay in the field of child care or special education, they can\u2019t live on $10 an hour. A cashier at Aldi grocery store can earn more than $13 an hour, Miranda Gilbert said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s $3 more, and it\u2019s a lot less work,\u201d she said.\n\nThe turnover is difficult on Elliott, who, like many kids with special needs, has a hard time with transitions.\n\n\u201cWhen they\u2019re connecting with this person and they\u2019re getting the routines down, and then they leave, it\u2019s a struggle,\u201d Miranda Gilbert said.\n\nAnother complication: The shortage of direct care workers also could slow a statewide effort to help people with disabilities live as independently as possible.\n\nA 1999 U.S. Supreme Court ruling known as the Olmstead decision required public agencies to provide services to people with disabilities in the least restrictive setting possible.\n\nIn response, Minnesota officials developed a plan to move people with disabilities who could live on their own out of group homes and into more independent housing. But often they still require support staff to help with budgeting, meal planning, laundry, shopping and other needs, Owen said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re finding our providers saying, \u2018We\u2019d love to do that,\u2019 \u201d she said. But with staffing shortages, many don\u2019t have enough employees to take it on and also continue to care for group home residents, Owen said.\n\n\u201cHaving direct care staff is critical to being able to move forward,\u201d she said.\n\nFollow Kirsti Marohn on Twitter, Facebook or contact her by phone at 320-255-8746.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.sctimes.com/story/news/local/2016/04/16/caregivers-tough-job-little-pay/82621684/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Minnesota is facing a shortage of workers to care for people with disabilities and seniors", "og": {"site_name": "St. Cloud Times", "description": "Minnesota is facing a shortage of workers to care for people with disabilities and seniors", "title": "Caregivers: Tough job, little pay", "url": "http://www.sctimes.com/story/news/local/2016/04/16/caregivers-tough-job-little-pay/82621684/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/sctimes.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Minnesota is facing a shortage of workers to care for people with disabilities and seniors", "title": "Caregivers: Tough job, little pay", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0895e4703e9c53c52eccfe2478904ca6d78886eb/c=421-0-1777-1356&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/04/13/StCloud/StCloud/635961800674046028-Caregiver-Wages-1.jpg", "creator": "@sctimes", "site": "@sctimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=830659200", "fb": {"app_id": 170170889686818}, "article": {"author": "http://www.facebook.com/sctimeskirsti"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Health care, seniors, disabilities, disabled, Medicaid, group homes, Legislature, Minnesota, WACOSA"}, "article_summary": "People often don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be expected of them when they start a direct care job, Owen said.\nEvery time the minimum wage is raised, it pushes closer to what the direct care workers earn, Howard said.\nThe company has 489 direct care staff, but could employ up to 600, said David Lyons, area director.\n\u201cHaving direct care staff is critical to being able to move forward,\u201d she said.\nDirect care workers are \u201cthe lifeblood of what we do,\u201d said Steve Howard, WACOSA\u2019s executive director."}
