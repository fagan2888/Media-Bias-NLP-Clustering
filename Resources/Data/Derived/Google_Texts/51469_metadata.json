It also made obscure terms into household words. Shrinkage and yada yada existed before Seinfeld, but it\u2019s doubtful you learned them anywhere else.\n\nAnother successful Seinfeld term has gone under the radar: Jerk Store. The term was coined in \u201cThe Comeback,\u201d when George is unselfconsciously stuffing his face with shrimp during a meeting. A co-worker sees George\u2019s gluttony and says, \u201cHey, George, the ocean called. They\u2019re running out of shrimp.\u201d George is speechless, but later he crafts a comeback: \u201cOh yeah? Well, the Jerk Store called, and they\u2019re running out of you.\u201d The episode shows George going to absurd lengths to find a way to use his comeback, as well as his friends\u2019 unwanted workshopping of the joke.\n\nIn a way, that workshopping has never ended\u2014at least on Twitter, which is likely the largest collection of jokes, good and bad, by professionals and amateurs, ever created. Many of those jokes involve formulas, and the Jerk Store has become a popular one. On Twitter, every day is the Summer of George.\n\nMost variations start with \u201cThe Jerk Store called,\u201d which is as trusty a joke starter as \u201cRelationship status:\u201d and \u201cWhen life hands you lemons.\u201d From there, the joke can go just about anywhere. Comic Warren Holstein makes a food joke out of the formula: \u201cThe Jerk Store called but I couldn\u2019t understand their thick Jamaican accents.\u201d Matt Koff reveals what would likely happen to a real-life Jerk Store: \u201cThe Jerk Store called. It\u2019s closing because it couldn\u2019t compete with Amazon. :(\u201c Some use the formula to comment on politics: \u201cThe Jerk Store called; they\u2019re no longer hiring because of fear of Obamacare mandates.\u201d I particularly like this joke, which finds the funny in sadness: \u201cThe jerk store called. We didn\u2019t chat for long but it was good to hear their voice. It was good to hear anyone\u2019s voice. I\u2019m so alone.\u201d\n\nOther tweeters abandon the formula when making Jerk Store jokes, like Laura Palmer: \u201cI\u2019m applying at the Jerk Store and I need references.\u201d This holiday tweet sounds like perfect storm of jerkdom: \u201cLooking forward to the Black Friday deals at the Jerk Store.\u201d Food trends also get spoofed: \u201cwhen will the jerk store start getting organic jerks. tired of getting these jerks full of gmos.\u201d Here\u2019s a particularly clever joke, playing on an annoying Frankenstein-related correction: \u201cActually, the jerk store\u2019s monster called.\u201d\n\nThis term/joke formula isn\u2019t going anywhere for at least a few reasons. Seinfeld is still omnipresent in reruns, and I reckon the entire series is imprinted on the collective unconscious. Plus, the world is full of jerks. The following are some recent epistles from the Jerk Store to help you get through the polar jerk-tex. Jerk Store might never make the OED, but it\u2019s one of the most successful joke franchises in the world.\n\nThe jerk store called, you left your credit card at the register. They are open until 8 if you want to pick it up today. \u2014 Chris Hallbeck (@ChrisHallbeck) November 17, 2014\n\nThe Jerk Store called. They miss you. They love you. They just want you to come home. \u2014 ben (@benicus_rex) November 13, 2014\n\nThe jerk store called. I didn't answer because I think it's unethical for jerks to be commodified & under a socialist system they'd be free \u2014 thxgvng internet dad (@Fauxgyptian) September 15, 2014\n\nO my sod, I am sorry for my sins w/ all my heart. In choosing to look out & failing to look within, I have \u221e voicemails from the jerk store \u2014 lanyard (@lanyardigan) September 12, 2014\n\nthe jerk store called & they said that making television references from the 90s won\u2019t stop the decay of all things. kind of a weird message \u2014 dire dire deer (@m_kopas) November 17, 2014\n\nI'm looking for a girl who's George at the Jerk Store and Elaine on the dance floor. \u2014 Scott Dooley (@scottdools) August 23, 2014\n\nThe jerk store called.
