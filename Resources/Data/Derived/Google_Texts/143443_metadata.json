Whelan, a member of Westborough Scout Troop 100, was one of 16 boys who were recognized at a ceremony a week earlier in the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston. He and a fellow Scout from Marlborough, Isaac Niedzielski, met frequently over the past year with a counselor to complete a program focused on finding one\u2019s vocation in life. They researched position papers on controversial religious issues, with Whelan advocating the ordination of women to the priesthood.\n\nCandidates were also asked to embrace an act of service, and Whelan chose to visit retirement communities of priests and nuns to learn from their life experience and to recognize their own lifetime of service. To that end, he spent an evening at the Bethany Campus of the Sisters of St. Joseph in Framingham, and also paid a visit to the Regina Cleri home for retired priests in Boston.\n\nThe award is named in honor of Pius XII, the pope who guided the Church through the tragedy of World War II.
