Independent Health on Wednesday reported a $75.1 million operating loss for 2014, blaming the result on the cost of investment in information technology, an increase in its pension fund obligation, taxes and fees included in the federal Affordable Care Act and money set aside to cover projected shortfalls in its Medicare and Medicaid business lines this year.

After investments and taxes are factored in, the Amherst-based insurer reported a net loss of $60.2 million in 2014, one year after earning net income of $19.6 million, according to its annual filing with the state Department of Financial Services.

Independent Health expected to lose money in 2014 but was surprised at the extent of the loss, which required the insurer to draw $69 million from its reserve fund, said Mark Johnson, Independent Health’s executive vice president and chief financial officer.

Independent Health is the region’s second-largest health insurer, with 381,123 members as of Jan. 1, an increase of 23,926, or nearly 7 percent, in its membership from one year earlier.

Because of the way the company is incorporated, the two entities that make up Independent Health – Independent Health Association and Independent Health Benefits Corporation – file their previous year’s financial statements at the end of March.

The region’s other large insurers, BlueCross BlueShield of Western New York and Univera Healthcare, file their statements at the beginning of March. The parent companies of BlueCross BlueShield and Univera also reported operating losses for 2014.

Independent Health’s revenues of $1.8 billion were largely unchanged between 2013 and 2014, rising just $2.2 million from the previous year. But the company’s total expenses, or underwriting deductions, rose by 4.6 percent, or $84.8 million, to $1.9 billion. Medical and hospital spending accounted for $17.2 million of that increase.

Johnson said the company’s commercial business and Medicaid business did as well, or better, than projected. But the managed Medicare line of business was hurt by increased medical and prescription drug expenses and lower reimbursements from the federal government. Over the past two years, under the terms of the ACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services have reduced payments to Medicare Advantage plans by 10 percent, according to the insurer.

Independent Health set aside $58 million to cover anticipated losses for its Medicaid and Medicare lines for 2015, a move that had a $21 million net impact on the company’s finances for 2014.

“The underwriting loss was really driven by our Medicare business,” Johnson said.

That $21 million impact is accounted for in the insurer’s general administrative costs, which soared by nearly 30 percent, or $45.3 million, to $199 million last year. Johnson said another large portion of that increased spending, about $19 million, was the insurer’s continued investment in new information technology.

The company also paid $26 million in new taxes and fees in 2014 as part of another provision of the Affordable Care Act. And fluctuating interest rates from 2013 and 2014 were the primary force behind a $17 million negative impact on Independent Health’s pension fund, one year after the insurer reported a $33 million favorable pension impact.

In response, Independent Health took $69 million out of its reserve fund, which stood at $560 million at the end of 2013 and $491 million last year.

Independent Health last May announced it was forming a strategic alliance with Albany-based CDPHP. Little activity has taken place since then, but company spokesman Frank Sava said Wednesday the insurer remains committed to the partnership. CDPHP, for its part, on Wednesday reported a net loss of $37.2 million on $2.2 billion in revenue.

Independent Health’s filing also detailed payments to its top executives, including five who earned $900,000 or more last year.

The company paid Dr. Michael Cropp, its president and CEO, $1.6 million in salary and other compensation in 2014. Other top earners included: John Rodgers, executive vice president and chief operating officer, $1.1 million; Johnson, the chief financial officer, $1.1 million; Dr. Thomas Foels, executive vice president and chief medical officer, $991,745; and Jill Syracuse, executive vice president and chief servicing officer, $915,957.
