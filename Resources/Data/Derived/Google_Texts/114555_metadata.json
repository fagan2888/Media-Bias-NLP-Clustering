And his rehabilitation will take several months \u2014 perhaps pushing back the start of his spring training, Rockies head athletic trainer Keith Dugger said.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to be until that 4 1/2- to 5-month mark,\u201d Dugger said. \u201cHe might be a little delayed in spring training. But our goal is to get him there and get him ready.\u201d\n\nDoctors cut out a torn part of Gonzalez\u2019s patella tendon in his left knee. They also removed a bursa sac and cleaned up a fat pad, Dugger said.\n\nGonzalez played through left knee tendinitis since spring training. He was shut down last week, on Aug. 14, after an MRI showed his knee injury grew worse in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t quite sure what way they were going to go (in surgery),\u201d Dugger said. \u201cThey ended up removing a whole bursa that was in there. There was a fat pad that was kind of beat up and tore up, they cleaned it out. And then the middle third of the patella tendon, where the actual diseased tissue was, they cut that out and sewed it back together.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s knee surgery was Gonzalez\u2019s third surgery this year \u2014 he also had a tumor removed from his left index finger in June and his appendix removed in January.\n\nHe returned to Denver from Vail after the surgery and will be on crutches for several weeks.\n\n\u201cNothing\u2019s a cure-all,\u201d Dugger said. \u201cActually, the closest thing to a cure-all is the rehab.\u201d\n\nFlande down to Triple-A. The Rockies on Tuesday optioned left-handed pitcher Yohan Flande to Triple-A Colorado Springs and called-up utilityman Matt McBride. They also moved Troy Tulowitzki to the 60-day disabled list.\n\nThat leaves right-hander Christian Bergman as an option start Sunday against Miami. Bergman has been out since June 20 with a broken hand.\n\nCuddy sits. Michael Cuddyer sat Tuesday with \u201chamstring soreness,\u201d Weiss said, after he played both games of a doubleheader Sunday in his return from the disabled list.\n\nCuddyer finished with 10 at-bats and in the second game he hit for the cycle. \u201cHe ran around the bases a lot the other day,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHe red-lined the other day.\u201d\n\nBetancourt rising. Rafael Betancourt, the Rockies\u2019 former closer who is rehabbing after Tommy John surgery on his injured right pitching elbow last September, on Sunday moved up the Triple-A from rookie-level Grand Junction.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s building himself up,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if there\u2019s an opportunity to get him in the mix down the stretch.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke\n\nLooking ahead\n\nRoyals\u2019 Danny Duffy (8-10, 2.60 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (12-8, 4.32), 6:40 p.m. Wednesday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nThe rash of injuries that sunk the Rockies\u2019 pitching staff touched nearly everybody, including De La Rosa. But Colorado\u2019s ace has nonetheless been dependable. He\u2019ll make a team-high 26th start against Kansas City, topping 25 starts for the second consecutive season and third time in his career. And in 12 starts at Coors Field, De La Rosa is 8-2 with a 3.30 ERA..\n\nThursday: Off\n\nFriday: Marlins\u2019 Henderson Alvarez (9-5, 2.43 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Franklin Morales (5-6, 5.04), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nSaturday: Marlins\u2019 Tom Koehler (9-9, 3.82) at Rockies\u2019 Jordan Lyles (6-1, 4.01), 6:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nNick Groke, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe19c4\"", "article_summary": "And his rehabilitation will take several months \u2014 perhaps pushing back the start of his spring training, Rockies head athletic trainer Keith Dugger said.\nGonzalez played through left knee tendinitis since spring training.\nBut our goal is to get him there and get him ready.\u201dDoctors cut out a torn part of Gonzalez\u2019s patella tendon in his left knee.\nCarlos Gonzalez said \u201ceverything went perfect\u201d with surgery on his left knee Monday in Vail, but the Rockies outfielder might be looking at a rehab that will make him late for spring training.\n\u201cHe might be a little delayed in spring training."}
