So I did. After all, I agree with the ad's statement that \"Fracking is an important issue for all of Colorado.\"\n\nWith Colorado communities voting to ban fracking and the industry responding with lawsuits, it's pretty clear that robust public debate and straight talk are in order. CRED's new website is, in the group's words, \"aimed at answering Coloradan's most important questions about fracking.\"\n\nHowever, its aim is not true. I typed my questions in the blank below the words \"Ask us a question.\" I figured that I'd eventually get some kind of response, even if it was canned.\n\nBut no matter what I typed, I was directed to the same \"fact sheet\" that paints a picture of a world in which nothing ever goes wrong. No freelance questions wanted or accepted.\n\nSo, here are the questions I tried to submit but couldn't:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy does the industry fight disclosure of the specific make-up, including concentrations, of the chemicals in fracking fluids if they pose no danger to human health and the environment?\n\nWhy does the industry object to a federal proposal to assess each well casing that is protecting usable water?\n\nWould the industry agree to using chemical tracers to prove that fracking fluids don't mix with groundwater or contaminate drinking water wells?\n\nWould the industry agree to, and not fight, a thorough, independent study of the impacts of fracking?\n\nCRED says that fracking \"has been part of Colorado for the past 60 years,\" but hasn't the technology radically changed, opening previously inaccessible areas to development? Does the industry think there are some places that just shouldn't be drilled?\n\nAnd is it a coincidence that the name Coloradans for Responsible Energy Development sounds so similar to Sportsmen for Responsible Energy Development, a group formed in 2008 by the National Wildlife Federation, Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership and Trout Unlimited?\n\nI didn't really type in that last question, but would love to hear the answer.\n\nJudith Kohler is communications manager for the regional office of the National Wildlife Federation in Boulder, and a spokeswoman for Sportsmen for Responsible Energy Development, a coalition led by NWF, Trout Unlimited and the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/guest-opinions/ci_25087536/questions-fracking-need-answers", "sailthru.section": "Opinion: Guest Opinions", "sailthru.author": "By Judith Kohler", "description": "Coloradans for Responsible Energy Development, backed by two of the largest energy companies doing business in Colorado \u2014 Anadarko Petroleum Corp.", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:25087536:view"}, "startDate": "2014-02-08T01:00:00-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/guest-opinions/ci_25087536/questions-fracking-need-answers", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Coloradans for Responsible Energy Development, backed by two of the largest energy companies doing business in Colorado \u2014 Anadarko Petroleum Corp.", "title": "Questions on fracking need answers"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Coloradans for Responsible Energy Development, backed by two of the largest energy companies doing business in Colorado \u2014 Anadarko Petroleum Corp.", "title": "Questions on fracking need answers", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/guest-opinions/ci_25087536/questions-fracking-need-answers", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-02-08T01:00:00-0700", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "sailthru.title": "Questions on fracking need answers", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "byline": "By Judith Kohler", "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "modificationDate": "2014-02-07T15:40:16-0700", "endDate": "2024-02-08T01:00:00-0700", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "pubDate": "2014-02-07T15:40:39-0700", "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9761\"", "article_summary": "CRED's latest TV ad includes an invitation to go to its website, studyfracking.com, for \"answers to all your questions\" about fracking.\nCRED's new website is, in the group's words, \"aimed at answering Coloradan's most important questions about fracking.\"\nI support safe and responsible energy development.\nWould the industry agree to using chemical tracers to prove that fracking fluids don't mix with groundwater or contaminate drinking water wells?\nWould the industry agree to, and not fight, a thorough, independent study of the impacts of fracking?"}
