Other agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service, have had a spate of their own technological disasters. Just last week, the GAO released a separate report flagging security weaknesses in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\u2019s financial IT systems.\n\nThe auditors said that although the FDIC, which had previously struggled with tech troubles, had \u201cmade progress in securing\u201d its financial systems, it had failed to implement specific recommendations made by GAO, which has led to vulnerabilities in the \u201cconfidentiality, integrity and availability of financial systems and information.\u201d\n\n\u201cFDIC did not fully or consistently implement aspects of its information security program,\u201d the report said.\n\nFor example, GAO said the FDIC failed to put in place controls for identifying and authenticating users or restricting access to sensitive data. The FDIC also hadn\u2019t encrypted sensitive data or conducted background investigations on employees.\n\nWithout implementing these controls, auditors said the FDIC\u2019s systems are exposed to an \u201cunnecessary risk of inadvertent or deliberate misuse, improper modification, unauthorized disclosure or destruction.\u201d\n\nFor its part, the agency said it would implement such controls by the end of the year.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Serious tech troubles at the Treasury Department are so severe that they could disrupt", "title": "Treasury Dept IT System Flagged for Security Issues", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/21/Treasury-Dept-IT-System-Flagged-Security-Issues", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03312014_Computer_Chains.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/21/Treasury-Dept-IT-System-Flagged-Security-Issues", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/03312014_Computer_Chains.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Serious tech troubles at the Treasury Department are so severe that they could disrupt", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb8c2\"", "article_summary": "The Government Accountability Office flagged at least 20 problems within the Bureau of the Fiscal Service\u2019s tech system\u2014all of which involve security management issues.\nJust last week, the GAO released a separate report flagging security weaknesses in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\u2019s financial IT systems.\nThe Fiscal Service commissioner addressed the auditor\u2019s findings and said the agency is currently taking actions to resolve the issues.\nRelated: Another Failed Gov IT Project Costs $1.1 BillionThe auditors said the issues constitute a \"significant deficiency\" for financial reporting purposes.\n\"Fiscal Service will continue to look for efficient and effective ways to improve and ensure the consistent application of agency-wide security controls over all systems,\" the final audit states."}
