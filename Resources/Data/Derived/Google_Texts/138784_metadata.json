Steve Beshear has a fight on his hands to convince first-year Republican Gov. Matt Bevin to halt a rollback of the state\u2019s health insurance exchange and transition expanded Medicaid recipients to the federal government.\n\nIf Bevin is successful in transitioning services, Kentucky would be the first state in the nation to shut down a working state exchange.\n\nBeshear has created a non-profit group, Save Kentucky Healthcare, to oppose changes to the healthcare system he put in place during his tenure.\n\nKentucky\u2019s exchange was heralded as a national success under the Affordable Care Act, but Beshear warns this isn\u2019t about two people, but rather about the health of the state.\n\n\u201cThis is not about Gov. Bevin and me,\u201d Beshear said in an interview with Pure Politics. \u201cI know that politically people like to posture it like that. This is about healthcare for Kentuckians. I hope at the end of the day Gov. Bevin and I agree that every single Kentuckian deserves to have affordable healthcare.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether he believes it or not,\u201d Beshear continued. \u201cI hope he does. Because a leader in Kentucky, a governor in Kentucky, I think needs to believe in the health of his people and providing healthcare for the people.\u201d\n\nUnder Beshear, Kentucky expanded Medicaid, a social health care program to help low-income earners, to those earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. Beshear also implemented an integrated state-based exchange known as kynect, where uninsured Kentuckians could be matched with Medicaid if they met the federal guidelines or qualified health plans.\n\nThe federal government under President Barack Obama paid for Kentucky to set up and pay for the exchange under Beshear.\n\n\u201cIt works,\u201d Beshear said of kynect. \u201cIt\u2019s been the model in the nation. \u2026 Where is the argument other than it\u2019s something set up by President Obama and I don\u2019t like it?\u201d\n\nWhat Beshear said Kentuckians should be watching is what Bevin does with the expanded Medicaid population.\n\nBevin has shown the capacity to move on the issue of healthcare from where he was during the election season. The state-based exchange he once promised to do away with is essentially replicated by using the website Benefind to only apply for Medicaid, Kentucky Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the Kentucky Transitional Assistance Program.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re now talking about some type of hybrid type of thing,\u201d Beshear said of Benefind. \u201cAnd they\u2019re talking about maybe some waivers in the Medicaid program.\u201d\n\nDollars and sense\n\nBevin has fought the exchange, calling the program unsustainable, but Beshear argues that the program is already creating jobs and revenue for the state.\n\nThe current administration claims that the by transitioning to the federal exchange, Kentucky will save $20 million a year, and Bevin says it will cost far less than previously expected to shut down the kynect website in IT costs.\n\nRegardless of the name, Beshear said one way or another the state would have a healthcare exchange. And whatever the costs are for the programs, it will still cost the state more in the expanded Medicaid population, Beshear said.\n\nBevin\u2019s moves won\u2019t save any dollars in the long run by switching services, unless he reduces the population, he said.\n\nBeshear referenced reports from Deloitte Consulting and a report from the Bevin administration which shows job growth from the medical field after the Medicaid expansion.\n\nThe Kentucky Center for Economic Policy released a graph showing the increase in medical-related fields, based on a report from the Kentucky Labor Market Information and the Bureau of Labor and Statistics.\n\n\u201cWhat it means is that it\u2019s growing the economy,\u201d Beshear said. \u201cThose people are paying taxes that money is available to cover any excess cost of this program and it will pay for itself in the long run.\u201d\n\nSome of the studies Beshear cites which predicted Medicaid expansion would create jobs and come at a $30 billion boon to the state\u2019s economy, but Senate President Robert Stivers, R-Manchester, said the studies missed the mark when they predicted that expanded Medicaid eligibility would add just 200,000 people to the program.\n\n\u201cPrice Waterhouse Coopers had projected that 200-something thousand people would get on the rolls because of that and we actually had 400,000. Great. Because there were that many people that needed healthcare,\u201d Beshear said in response.\n\nBevin has called the studies \u201cbaloney,\u201d but Beshear said Bevin is still using the consulting group \u2014 Deloitte.\n\n\u201cAnybody that\u2019s against this just because it had President Obama\u2019s name on it, they\u2019re not going to be paying attention to numbers, they\u2019re not going to pay any attention to facts, but all I ask them is give us some facts, give us some evidence, give us some studies,\u201d Beshear said.\n\nBeshear predicted that the people who are in the Medicaid program now will become healthier, seek better employment and move out of the Medicaid system and into the qualified health plans.\n\nThe former governor went on to say the only argument he hears is the economic cost of the program being unsustainable, his counter came in the form of a challenge.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just not true, or if it is true, prove it,\u201d he said.\n\nShutting it down\n\nThe cost of shuttering the state portal to affordable health insurance is also a point of contention between the two governors. Initially, Beshear said that Deloitte Consulting told his administration during the summer of 2015 that it would cost $23 million to shut down the program, when the issue was raised on the campaign trail.\n\nDeloitte later shuttered a state-based exchange in another state that wasn\u2019t operating correctly. After the shutdown, Beshear said the group had created a program that was less expensive, but he said the group never shared the number to end Kentucky\u2019s exchange and transition.\n\nStill, he thinks the Bevin\u2019s administration\u2019s predictions that the transition would cost less than $240,000 are \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to ask the Bevin administration to ask Deloitte to come out and talk about it. You know, I think that would be good for everybody,\u201d Beshear said.\n\nAt the end of the day, Beshear said there shouldn\u2019t be an argument over numbers, the argument he suggested should be about whatever system the state has if it\u2019s good for Kentuckians.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "cn|2", "description": "After two terms in office, former Democratic Gov.
