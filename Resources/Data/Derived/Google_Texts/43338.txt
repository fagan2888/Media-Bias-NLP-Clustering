Bill O’Reilly opened his show Thursday night with a simple question: in the five years he’s been president, exactly what has President Obama accomplished? From the dismal economy to political division to the current chaos over Syria, O’Reilly didn’t see much in Obama’s presidency so far that would have a positive impact on his legacy.

O’Reilly asked some of his frequent liberal guests about what they think the best thing Obama’s done is, from Kirsten Powers to Alan Colmes to Marc Lamont Hill, but the only one O’Reilly agreed was a positive was Obama’s prosecution of the war on terror.

Other than that, the economy is weak, the national debt is still escalating, “U.S. foreign policy is confusing,” Iran and North Korea are developing nuclear weapons, and the Middle East is in complete chaos. He said, “The president, after five years, [is] not really accomplished very much.”

O’Reilly went back to Syria, predicting that there will be a deal for Assad to hand over his chemical weapons (though O’Reilly thought it would most likely be an empty promise). And if Obama doesn’t fix things soon, whatever ensues, O’Reilly warned, will be part of his legacy.
