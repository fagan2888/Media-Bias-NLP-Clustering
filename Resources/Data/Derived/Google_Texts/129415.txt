In another blow to the chances of Rousseff blocking impeachment on charges of breaking budget laws, the PSD's leader in the chamber, Rogerio Rosso, told reporters that a vast majority of the party's 38 lower house members back impeachment.

It was up to the party's sole minister in Rousseff's cabinet, Minister of Cities Gilberto Kassab, to decide whether to resign his post or not, Rosso said.
