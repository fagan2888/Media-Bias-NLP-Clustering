Pat McCrory would be embarrassed to release a video recognizing state employees (see below) on the same day that the ink is drying on a new state budget that once more leaves them mostly out in the cold, but, alas, a capacity for being embarrassed does not appear to be a part of the Guv\u2019s makeup. Here\u2019s Chris Fitzsimon explaining the details in today\u2019s Fitzsimon File:\n\n\u201cIn a case of perfect timing, Governor Pat McCrory released a video Friday morning thanking state employees for their service to North Carolina and declaring next week State Employee Recognition Week. Later in the morning McCrory signed a state budget that denies most state employees a raise, instead giving them a one-time $750 bonus that will not count toward their retirement. The lack of a raise comes despite a state revenue surplus. Legislative leaders and McCrory decided to cut taxes again, primarily on corporations and the wealthy, instead of giving state workers even the modest two percent across the board pay increase the House budget originally proposed. McCrory wants to recognize state employees\u2014but not pay them very much.\u201d\n\nBack in May, McCrory said he wanted the state\u2019s budget surplus to be used to give state employees a raise.
