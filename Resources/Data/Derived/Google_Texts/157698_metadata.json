In the letter, Mr. Einhorn wrote he bought Micron at $16.49; it closed Friday at $25.08.\n\nHe wrote it was the first time he had taken a long position in a company he had once shorted.\n\n\u201cA decade of poor results exposed every flaw in the business and killed any love for the stock,\u201d Mr. Einhorn wrote. \u201cThe sell-side group think has reversed: the mostly bearish analysts now contort themselves to justify earnings estimates that are too low, price targets that are too pessimistic, and stock ratings that are too negative.\u201d\n\nGreenlight exited its position in home building and mortgage company NVR during the fourth quarter, the filings indicate.\n\nThe filings also showed Greenlight has stuck to a sizeable long position in Apple Greenlight owned $1.3 billion worth of shares in Apple as of Dec. 31, mostly unchanged from a quarter earlier.\n\nGreenlight, which manages $10 billion overall, returned 19% last year, according to investor documents, handily beating the average stock hedge-fund tracked by research firm HFR. The fund dropped about 2% in January.
