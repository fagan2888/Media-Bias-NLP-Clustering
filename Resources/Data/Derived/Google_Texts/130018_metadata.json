Tim Scott saw his first piece of legislation become law this month, a bipartisan effort that tweaked existing Obamacare regulations and helps small business owners who faced employee insurance premium increases next year.\n\nOnline To stay up-to-date on South Carolina politics, go to palmettopolitics.com or download the Palmetto Politics app for iOS or Android.\n\nAfter the measure was approved by both chambers \u2014 done by voice votes each \u2014 it was quickly signed by President Barack Obama.\n\nWhile there was no bill-signing ceremony to mark the occasion, Scott received a congratulatory email from the White House saying it had met with the president\u2019s approval.\n\n\u201cIt was a little more painful than it might appear,\u201d said Scott, who introduced the Senate version of the proposal earlier this spring.\n\nThe legislation was dubbed the Protecting Affordable Coverage for Employee Act. It\u2019s designed to head off some of the premium increases that smaller businesses were facing in January as the Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare, takes hold.\n\nThe bill addresses the definition of what the size a small business is considered. Previously, the health law defined small businesses as any operation having up to 50 employees. That figure was scheduled to go up to 100 workers beginning in January.\n\nScott, R-S.C., who sits on the Senate\u2019s Health and Small Business and Finance committees, agreed with several business organizations that said doubling the definition of what a small business is would increase employer health care costs significantly. For some, it would have meant \u201cowners will have to make a decision\u201d between raises, bonuses and even keeping people on staff, Scott said. The change means companies can stave off the premium increase in employee health insurance of about 18 percent.\n\nThe legislation keeps that small business definition at 50 workers but still allows for states to increase the number if they opt to do so.\n\nThe effort was endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation, the National Restaurant Association and the National Federation of Independent Business. New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen was a supporter, as well.\n\nS.C. Chamber of Commerce CEO Ted Pitts said Scott\u2019s bill avoids higher health care premiums for about 900 chamber members.\n\n\u201cWe applaud Sen. Scott for his leadership on mitigating harmful effects the Affordable Care Act could have on small businesses,\u201d he said, adding that chamber members see the ACA as one of the biggest impediments to growth and job creation.\n\nThe passage was seen as a rare point of agreement on Capitol Hill on Obamacare, which Democrats have defended on the presidential campaign trail and Republicans have pledged to dismantle.\n\nIt also wasn\u2019t always smooth sailing for the effort. Some Democrats wanted to only delay the jump to 100 employees, not to halt it.\n\nWhile Scott has had other suggestions become part of passed legislation, this was his first solo effort after joining the Senate in 2013 after Gov. Nikki Haley appointed him to fill the vacancy created when Jim DeMint quit to run the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nEven with initiating the change, Scott remains among the Republicans in Washington who want to see Obamacare completely scrapped for good.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t get rid of it wholesale, then try to eliminate it piece by piece,\u201d he said.\n\nReach Schuyler Kropf at (843) 937-5551.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "U.S. Sen.
