President Obama publicly released his birth certificate 878 days ago. And still, a Republican congressman went on national television Friday and cast doubt on the legitimacy of the Obama presidency.

Republican Rep. Blake Farenthold of Texas came on Hardball to discuss how fellow Lone Star State lawmaker Sen. Ted Cruz tried to defund Obamacare, and how the strategy may be blowing up in his face. Host Chris Matthews asked him about the criticism Cruz has been facing from his fellow GOPers.

Farenthold suggested those people might be preparing to run for president against Cruz.

Matthews then asked about Cruz’s eligibility, because he was born in Canada. (Matthews has long maintained that Cruz, who has an American mother, is indeed eligible to be president.)

“I believe he’s eligible. He had an American mother. I believe you’re a natural born citizen. Do you agree with that?” Matthews asked the congressman.

Farenthold replied, “Listen, we’ve had this discussion on Obama…He’s as eligible as Obama is.”

Ultimately, Matthews said, “Can you repeat after me: he was legitimately elected president.”

Farenthold repeated, but with a key word left out: “President Obama was elected president”

“Legitimately,” said Matthews.

“The people elected him,” Farenthold said, refusing to say “legitimately.”

Matthews concluded: “Everybody watching knows what you’re doing. You’re dodge balling.”
