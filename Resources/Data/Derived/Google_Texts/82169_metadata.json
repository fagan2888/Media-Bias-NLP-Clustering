[YouTube]\n\nJon Stewart started his last week hosting the Daily Show by dissecting how badly Fox News analyst Howard Kurtz misfired in trying to paint him as an apologist for President Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just playing around with you guys,\u201d Stewart said over shots of various Fox hosts. \u201cYour hypocrisy isn\u2019t a bug in the Fox model; it\u2019s the feature. Your job is to discredit any source of criticism that might hurt the conservative brand by angrily holding them to standards you yourselves jettison in your news network\u2019s mission statement.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, Kurtz and Baltimore Sun media critic David Zurawik accused Stewart of being \u201ca tool\u201d of the Obama administration, following Politico\u2019s report on the host\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d meetings with the president.\n\nStewart shot down Kurtz\u2019s segment with a barrage of Fox clips showing their hosts criticizing Obama by pointing out that \u201ceven\u201d Stewart himself was knocking him on various policy decisions. It was also Kurtz, Stewart noted, who reported on Fox officials instructing the news department to call the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a.k.a. Obamacare \u2014 \u201cgovernment-run healthcare\u201d at every opportunity.\n\n\u201cMy hunch is, this show\u2019s been harder on the Obama administration and this president per capita than you ever were in your eight years of [George W.] Bush fingerb*nging,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nHowever, he added, Fox will not \u201cget around\u201d to verifying that statistic, since the conservative network never responded to his compilation of 50 Fox lies in six seconds that aired this past February.\n\nStewart then asked Fox, \u201cHow does that motherf*cking taste?\u201d before lighting an imaginary match and yelling, \u201cAdios motherf*ckers!\u201d \u2026 only to be reminded that he still has three shows left, including a nearly-hourlong finale on Thursday.\n\nWatch Stewart\u2019s commentary, as posted online on Monday, below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Jon-Stewart-hosts-The-Daily-Show-on-Aug.-3-2015.-YouTube-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "\u2018Adios, motherf*ckers!\u2019: Jon Stewart torches Fox News one more time \u2014 and it\u2019s awesome"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m just playing around with you guys,\u201d Stewart said over shots of various Fox hosts.\nJon Stewart hosts 'The Daily Show' on Aug. 3, 2015.\nIt was also Kurtz, Stewart noted, who reported on Fox officials instructing the news department to call the Affordable Care Act \u2014 a.k.a.\nStewart shot down Kurtz\u2019s segment with a barrage of Fox clips showing their hosts criticizing Obama by pointing out that \u201ceven\u201d Stewart himself was knocking him on various policy decisions.\n[YouTube]Jon Stewart started his last week hosting the Daily Show by dissecting how badly Fox News analyst Howard Kurtz misfired in trying to paint him as an apologist for President Barack Obama."}
