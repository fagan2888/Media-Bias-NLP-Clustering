When the Democrats rammed Obamacare through Congress in 2010 without a single Republican vote, the CBO said that the unpopular overhaul would lead to a net increase of 26 million people with health insurance by 2015 (15 million through Medicaid plus 13 million through the Obamacare exchanges minus 2 million who would otherwise have had private insurance but wouldn\u2019t because of Obamacare).\n\nFast-forwarding five years, the CBO now says that Obamacare\u2019s tally for 2015 will actually be a net increase of just 17 million people (10 million through Medicaid plus 11 million through the Obamacare exchanges minus 4 million who would otherwise have had private insurance but won\u2019t, or don\u2019t, because of Obamacare).\n\nIn other words, Obamacare is now slated to hit only 65 percent of the CBO\u2019s original coverage projection for 2015.\n\nObamacare\u2019s under-publicized failure on this key point is attributable to a variety of factors, including but not limited to the following: People aren\u2019t thrilled with Obamacare-compliant insurance\u2019s high cost and limited doctor networks, and some would even rather pay a fine for refusing to buy such insurance than pay its premiums; the Supreme Court ruled that part of Obamacare was unconstitutional, thereby giving states more freedom not to help expand it; and HealthCare.gov has been more reminiscent of DMV.org than of Expedia.com.\n\nIn addition (and just as the CBO originally projected), the bulk of Obamacare\u2019s net coverage gains are coming from dumping people into Medicaid (59 percent of the current projected net increase in 2015), not from getting people enrolled in private insurance (41 percent). Of course, President Obama rarely if ever talks about that aspect of Obamacare \u2014 but Republicans should.\n\nIn light of all this, it\u2019s time for a winning conservative alternative to Obamacare that would pave the way to full repeal, offer a flat (age-based) refundable tax credit that would get people off of Medicaid and onto private insurance (letting them shop for value in the process), and give a tax cut to millions of Main Street Americans who buy health insurance on their own. Such everyday Americans generally receive nothing under Obamacare, have gotten the short end of the tax stick for decades, and deserve to get a tax break for buying individual-market insurance that\u2019s roughly akin to the tax break for having employer-based insurance.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "CBO,Credit,Health Care,Jeffrey H.
