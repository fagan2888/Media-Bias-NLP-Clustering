According to news accounts, Johnson stumbled and fell somewhere around either the 16-mile or the 20-mile mark, hitting her head. She tenaciously got up and, after being bandaged at a first-aid tent, finished the race in 7:57:41, barely off her usual pace. The next morning, as she customarily did, she joined the post-race crowd at Rockefeller Center, where she was interviewed by the NBC Today show\u2019s Al Roker, wearing a scarf that only partly obscured her bandaged head. Afterward, she returned to the Roosevelt Hotel with her two sisters, and lay down in her bed, complaining of fatigue. When she failed to awaken, she was rushed to Bellevue Hospital, where she was declared dead.\n\nJohnson\u2019s passing stunned and saddened the running world. \u201cShe was an inspiration to us all,\u201d the New York Road Runners, the race\u2019s sponsor, said in a statement.\n\nBut Johnson, whose ambition was to keep running for as long as she was around, might have been more sanguine. In a 2008 interview, she recalled the thrill of her first NYC race. \u201cWhen I crossed that finish line in Central Park, I just knew this is what I would do the rest of my life,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cRunning makes you feel good. It\u2019s energizing. You sleep better at night. And the best part for me is you can eat anything you want.\u201d\n\n>> Get travel discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\nHere\u2019s a 2008 interview with Johnson, who appears at 14:30 in the video.\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "At 86, distance runner Joy Johnson was a remarkable athlete.
