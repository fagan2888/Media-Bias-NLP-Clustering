(Photo: Aude Guerrucci, Pool, Getty Images)\n\nPresident Obama had something to say about the Oscars diversity debate, even though he was actually supposed to be talking about healthcare.\n\nThe president spent part of Wednesday in a round of interviews in Washington with TV anchors from Richmond, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Salt Lake City, Denver, Los Angeles and Oakland, talking about the Affordable Care Act and ramping up enrollment for health-insurance coverage.\n\nNaturally, the ABC affiliate station in Los Angeles asked him about the big local story there: the outcry over two straight years of all-white acting nominees for the Academy Awards.\n\nThe Oscars ceremony is Feb. 28; already some stars (Spike Lee, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith) have said they're doing something else that night, in protest.\n\nOscars diversity debate makes it to the White House https://t.co/NJQBlb0Xg9 \u2014 Jonjon Mendoza Susi (@kTiNoJ) January 27, 2016\n\nObama said the diversity debate is an expression of a broader issue: \"Are we making sure that everybody is getting a fair shot?\"\n\nIt's also an issue of artistic integrity, he said. \"I think that when everyone's story is told then that makes for better art,\" he said.\n\nPresident Obama and Steven Spielberg at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, on Jan. 27, 2016.

Are we making sure that everybody is getting a fair shot?\"\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Obama crossed paths with Oscar winner and Hollywood honcho Steven Spielberg at the Israeli Embassy, when he spoke at the Righteous Among the Nations award ceremony, posthumously honoring an American Marine for actions he took as a prisoner of war in World War II.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1WQ7WzZ", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "'When everyone's story is told, then that makes for better art.'", "og": {"site_name": "USA TODAY", "description": "'When everyone's story is told, then that makes for better art.'", "title": "Obama: Oscars diversity is about 'everyone getting fair shot'", "url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/01/28/obama-oscars-diversity-about-everyone-getting-fair-shot/79470052/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/usatoday.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'When everyone's story is told, then that makes for better art.'", "title": "Obama: Oscars diversity is about 'everyone getting fair shot'", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c70833033aa9ac4951f2690fe4ec0b79847123c5/c=506-0-2434-1928&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635895904870773425-GTY-507187494.jpg", "creator": "@usatoday", "site": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "fb": {"app_id": 215046668549694}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Persons/Steven Spielberg", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Persons/Steven Spielberg", "title": "Obama: Oscars diversity is about 'everyone getting fair shot'", "author": "Maria Puente", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "life/movies", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b99dfd55533b4f7c5d7d8d9f83fbb742dfc26dcb/c=770-0-2216-1928/local/-/media/2016/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635895904870773425-GTY-507187494.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2c80cf9faeeef28fe4501f5b244449b3e41c0698/c=506-0-2434-1928/local/-/media/2016/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635895904870773425-GTY-507187494.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/21838801f49880e1190617c3251889173282d343/c=315-0-2879-1928/local/-/media/2016/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635895904870773425-GTY-507187494.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e0ddb7f473d7ffa5ed0de04f270934adc3ef6c6/c=0-62-3194-1867&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2016/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635895904870773425-GTY-507187494.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-01-28T15:33:44.737000-05:00", "shorthed": "Obama: Oscar diversity is about fairness", "articleid": 79470052, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6edc1dbfb5cd0f0c6de9c3b37305d78781d7b9cd/c=0-62-3194-1867/local/-/media/2016/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635895904870773425-GTY-507187494.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/797d79463a1c3827ba2c38e70e534e88aee6428d/c=893-0-1973-1928/local/-/media/2016/01/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/635895904870773425-GTY-507187494.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "President Obama, Oscars, diversity"}, "article_summary": "Oscars diversity debate makes it to the White House https://t.co/NJQBlb0Xg9 \u2014 Jonjon Mendoza Susi (@kTiNoJ) January 27, 2016Obama said the diversity debate is an expression of a broader issue: \"Are we making sure that everybody is getting a fair shot?\"\nAre we making sure that everybody is getting a fair shot?\"\n(Photo: Aude Guerrucci, Pool, Getty Images)President Obama had something to say about the Oscars diversity debate, even though he was actually supposed to be talking about healthcare.\nPresident Obama and Steven Spielberg at the Israeli Embassy in Washington, on Jan. 27, 2016.\nPresident Obama speaks at the Israeli Embassy in Washington for a ceremony posthumously honoring a U.S. Marine for actions as a prisoner of war in World War II, on Jan. 27, 2016."}
