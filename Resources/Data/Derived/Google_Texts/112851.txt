Today the Federalist Radio Hour recapped this weekend’s primary results, and discussed the presidential candidates’ health care plans with Veronique de Rugy, senior research fellow at Mercatus Center at George Mason University.

On the issue of whether Marco Rubio should drop out or not, Domenech said that if Rubio were to approach Ted Cruz with a unity ticket before Florida, he would avoid the embarrassment of losing in his home state. “He would seem magnanimous by putting his party and his country ahead of his own ambitions,” he said.

De Rugy said Donald Trump’s health care plan has been lacking details and his three main points were pretty inconsistent. “He wanted to get rid of Obamacare, the mandate, but to keep pre-existing conditions,” she said. “If you remove the mandate but you keep the pre-existing condition, you are going to have a major implosion, death-spiral of the insurance industry.”

The democratic nominee is going to exploit the issue of student debt to try to get out young voters and republicans are going to have to respond to the free college proposals. “There is no such thing as free lunch, even in education, so someone has to pay the bill,” De Rugy said. “We know that the best way to make something extremely expensive is to have the government tell you it’s free.”
