To drive the point home, he sent his deputies a link to a video of a congressional hearing where he had pledged the website would be ready.\n\n\u201cI made this promise on behalf of all of us,\u201d wrote Henry Chao, deputy chief information officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \u201cAnd I have no doubt together we will drive the outcomes that flow from this promise.\u201d\n\nEmails released Friday by the House Energy and Commerce Committee provide a snapshot of the cascading problems and growing anxiety inside the agency less than three months before healthcare.gov went live.\n\nPHOTOS: 2013's memorable political moments\n\nThe main gateway for people in 36 states to sign up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act faltered on the day it debuted and has remained balky ever since. Fewer than 27,000 people signed up for insurance on the site through Wednesday, far below the government\u2019s projections.\n\n\u201cAdministration officials looked us in the eye and told us everything was \u2018on track,\u2019 but when we pull back the curtain now, the mess is disturbing,\u201d said committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-Mich.). He said the revelations cast doubt on President Obama\u2019s promise to have healthcare.gov mostly repaired by Nov. 30.\n\nThe committee has set a hearing for Tuesday on whether healthcare.gov securely stores the personal information that consumers must provide to apply for health insurance.\n\nIn a statement, the agency said the emails revealed \u201cone small piece of ongoing discussions\u201d about the website development and some discussed elements that were not included in the website when it launched. \u201cManagement concerns about meeting timelines are expected for any project of this size and scope,\u201d the statement said. Not all the problem areas were considered high priority, the emails said.\n\nMost of the emails concern the work of CGI Federal Inc., the contractor hired by the agency to handle a large share of the work. The company, which has been awarded $2.4 billion for numerous federal contracts over the years, was selected over three others: IBM, QSSI and Computer Services Corp., according to the agency. The original CGI work order, for $93 million, wasn\u2019t signed until Sept. 30, 2011, a year and a half after the passage of the law.\n\nThe contract said the work was supposed to be far enough along for a \u201creadiness review\u201d in the first quarter of 2013. But in July, it wasn\u2019t close to ready.\n\nOne agency official wrote on July 8 that one piece of CGI\u2019s work was \u201cway off track and getting worse.\u201d Only 10 programmers were working on it, he said, and just one was skilled enough to handle complex problems. Another part, which was supposed to collect data from the state-based insurance exchanges, was \u201cweeks behind schedule with most of the CGI test cases failing.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: The battle over Obamacare\n\n\u201cI think we need to consider which items in our build will not be done if we don\u2019t get substantially greater staffing levels,\u201d wrote Jeffrey Grant of the agency's center for consumer information and insurance oversight.\n\nEventually, the agency decided to pull back on some features.\n\nMark Calem, a CGI vice president, replied that the company was adding staff to complete the work, which he said had become more challenging because of unfinished requirements and late changes.\n\nWhen one agency official wrote that CGI was asking for another $38 million, Chao responded with irritation, mentioning missed deadlines and poor-quality work. He told his staff to get tough with the company. \u201cI just need to feel more confident that they are not going to crash the plane on takeoff, regardless of price,\u201d he wrote.\n\nCGI has been paid $112 million to date on a revised contract total of $196 million.\n\nThe next day, July 17, Chao and agency administrator Marilyn Tavenner appeared before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and said there was still a lot to do but the website would be ready. Three days later, on a Saturday morning, Chao sent the C-Span link to that testimony to dozens of employees with the contractors and the agency. First on the list was Cheryl Campbell, a CGI senior vice president.\n\n\u201cI wanted to share this with you so you can see and hear that both Marilyn and I under oath stated that we are going to make Oct. 1,\u201d Chao wrote, thanking them for their \u201csupport and vigilance\u201d in making good on the promise.\n\nThe agency declined to make Chao and Grant available for interviews.\n\nIn a statement, a CGI spokeswoman said \u201cevolving requirements and shifting priorities\u201d added to the problems before the launch. The company declined to address the emails in detail. \u201cInstead of looking backwards, CGI is eyes forward,\u201d said Linda Odorisio, CGI vice president of communications.\n\nIn memos, the agency wrote that deadlines were slipping and trouble was looming. \u201cShort testing windows may impact quality if day 1 functionality is being developed all the way up to 7/31 and 8/15,\u201d one memo says. \u201cCascading slippages may occur.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Emails show officials alarmed by healthcare.gov months before debut", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Los Angeles Times", "author": "Los Angeles Times", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As work on healthcare.gov \u2014 the federal online portal to sign up for new health insurance plans \u2014 backed up during the summer, employees of the agency responsible for it started to raise alarms.", "title": "Emails show officials alarmed by healthcare.gov months before debut", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/politicsnow/la-pn-emails-officials-alarmed-healthcare-site-20131115-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5286af56/turbine/la-pn-emails-officials-alarmed-healthcare-site-20131115", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp16.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "obamacare, healthcare.gov, affordable care act, obama", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/78203485", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2013-11-15", "Description": "As work on healthcare.gov backed up this summer, employees of the agency responsible for it started to raise alarms.", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "obamacare, healthcare.gov, affordable care act, obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ef8\"", "article_summary": "In memos, the agency wrote that deadlines were slipping and trouble was looming.\nThe original CGI work order, for $93 million, wasn\u2019t signed until Sept. 30, 2011, a year and a half after the passage of the law.\nIn emails, they listed problems that included \u201cseriously substandard staffing,\u201d shoddy work and a lack of coordination between contractors.\nMost of the emails concern the work of CGI Federal Inc., the contractor hired by the agency to handle a large share of the work.\nHe said the revelations cast doubt on President Obama\u2019s promise to have healthcare.gov mostly repaired by Nov. 30."}
