Here are seven predictions from experts across the healthcare spectrum.\n\n1. Continuing Confusion About ObamaCare\n\nEven by the eve of 2015, the dust will still not have settled on who has what kind of coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).\n\nDr. Mark Smith, president and CEO of the California Healthcare Foundation, polled his colleagues on the issue of ACA's first year.\n\n\u201cNewly insured consumers won\u2019t really know what they\u2019re getting\u2014or what they\u2019re paying, when you factor in out-of-pocket costs, tax credits, and tax reconciliation\u2014until they\u2019ve been enrolled for a year or more and begin to seek and use care,\u201d he told Healthline.\n\n\u201cAs with recent events regarding obtaining and keeping coverage, we\u2019ll see stories of great benefit and others of significant hardship,\" he added. \"In a year, it may still be tough to know if collectively we are better off.\u201d\n\n2. Broader Acceptance of Medical Marijuana\n\nIllinois will ring in the new year by establishing a pilot program legalizing marijuana for medicinal use, becoming the 22nd state to make cannabis legal in some form. Dustin Sulak, an osteopath who prescribes medical marijuana in Maine, expects to see the nation continue to embrace the plant for its health benefits.\n\n\u201cCannabis awareness reaches a tipping point, growing exponentially as the medicine of choice for common medical conditions such as cancer, pain, and anxiety,\u201d he said.\n\nHe predicts that more people, including children and the elderly, will openly share success stories, while pharmaceutical companies launch their own cannabis products.\n\nMore cities and states will legalize cannabis, while the federal government continues to prohibit it, he predicts. At the same time, more Americans will have access to substance abuse treatment under a provision in the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRead More: 4 Illegal Drugs That Might Be Medicines\n\n3. Better Artificial Body Parts, Thanks to 3D Printing\n\nDr. Tom Vangsness, author of The New Science of Overcoming Arthritis, told Healthline that new three-dimensional printers will advance the creation of material that mimics human cartilage. He believes that 2014 will bring more innovative new research for the treatment of arthritis, including stem cell and gene therapies and miniature devices that use nanotechnology implanted beneath the skin to stimulate muscles.\n\nDr. Laura Niklason, a professor of anesthesia and biomedical engineering at Yale University, is a global leader in cellular therapies and bioengineered blood vessels. She founded Humacyte, Inc., which is pursuing the development of vessels grown from human cells on scaffolding. Their aim is to provide arteries that can be taken off the shelf in a hospital and implanted into people when needed. This year, the company will see the results of its first in-human clinical study.\n\nAnd earlier this month, Dr. Kristjan Ragnarsson of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City unveiled a bionic body suit that allows a patient paralyzed from the waist down to walk.\n\nSee Healthline's Picks for Top Innovations of 2013\n\n4. More Doctor Visits Replaced by Technology\n\nChip Burns, president of The Asbury Group Integrated Technology, said remote monitoring of everything from blood sugar to sleep will continue to revolutionize medicine. Digital avatars will be at the ready on a smart phone when a patient can't see a doctor.\n\nAlmost all of a person's health information will be available and exchanged online. In his recently released white paper \u201cThe Guide to the Future of Medicine: 40 Trends Shaping the Future,\u201d Dr. Bertalan Mesk\u00f3 issues a call for preparedness in this new age.\n\nWhile it will be convenient for many, some patients raise questions about how those without smartphones or Internet access at home will fare.\n\nAmy Gonzales, an assistant professor of telecommunications at Indiana University, is researching that issue.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that people without stable digital access are going to increasingly fall through the eHealth cracks,\" she said. \"This is especially a problem since the same people without stable digital access are also the most likely to be sick and need access to healthcare.\u201d\n\nRead More: Getting Care Anywhere via Virtual House Calls\n\n5. HIV Moving Closer to Extinction\n\nThere won't likely be a cure for HIV next year, but antiretroviral therapy, or ART, drugs will become even easier to tolerate as the globe inches toward a vaccine.\n\nJoel Gallant, chair of the HIV Medicine Association, said, \u201cImplementation, affordability, and uptake (of ART) remain the greatest challenges to biomedical prevention.\u201d\n\nAs for the tens of thousands of people in the U.S. with HIV who don't even know it, Gallant hopes the implementation of the ACA will get more people tested and treated. \u201cOnly then will the concept of 'treatment as prevention' start to have a real impact on our epidemic,\u201d he said.\n\nHIV Progress Report: Are We Close to a Cure?\n\n6. The Continued Rise of Personalized Medicine\n\nPatients with chronic conditions like multiple sclerosis will benefit most from treatment regimes tailored to them.\n\n\u201cOne of the matters that will need urgent attention in 2014 is the identification of biomarkers to help select the optimal drug to prescribe, with nine approved alternatives, for treatment of relapsing-remitting MS,\u201d said Lawrence Steinman, a neurology professor at the Beckman Center for Molecular Medicine at Stanford University.\n\nAs the need for new research grows, the public sector will play a growing role in funding and arranging healthcare, as a debate rages at all levels of government over who should pay for what.\n\n\u201cLook for a few cases, maybe coming from cash-strapped local government entities, where new ground is broken in addressing underlying cost drivers and more clearly defining ... responsibilities,\u201d Smith said.\n\n7. More People Choosing Healthy Habits\n\nThe American Medical Association classified obesity as a disease just this year, and the ACA requires most insurers to provide for obesity prevention programs. Add that to mounting evidence about the benefits of vegan diets, and the result will be finding sensible solutions to a deadly problem that often stems from a poor diet.\n\nNutrition based on genetic testing and the influence of gut bacteria on obesity will get plenty of attention, predicted Lise Gloede, a registered dietitian and certified diabetes instructing in Arlington, Va.\n\n\u201cHopefully fad diets will take a back seat, but that never seems to happen,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd the importance of washing one's hands will move to the forefront in healthcare settings as well. With healthcare-acquired infections on the rise, hospitals and medical professionals are scrambling for sanitation satisfaction.\n\nGet the Facts: Foods That Pack a Nutritious Punch", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/HEALTHY LIVING", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-30 12:28:19 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "From 3D printed organs to the impact of the Affordable Care Act, here's what to expect in the year ahead.", "twitter": {"description": "From 3D printed organs to the impact of the Affordable Care Act, here's what to expect in the year ahead.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/01/01/7-health-predictions-for-2014.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2014/01/01/7-health-predictions-for-2014/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422638900219.jpg?ve=1", "title": "7 health predictions for 2014", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/HEALTHY LIVING\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"health\",\"title\":\"7 health predictions for 2014\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2014/01/01/7-health-predictions-for-2014/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422638900219.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-01T11:30:01Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/01/01/7-health-predictions-for-2014.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"e9fce7e0-b78c-4c03-ab0d-b45e4213a77f\",\"section\":\"health\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "From 3D printed organs to the impact of the Affordable Care Act, here's what to expect in the year ahead.", "dc.identifier": "e9fce7e0-b78c-4c03-ab0d-b45e4213a77f", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "hlthliving", "description": "From 3D printed organs to the impact of the Affordable Care Act, here's what to expect in the year ahead.", "prism.section": "health", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "Healthline.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "7 Health Predictions For 2014", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-30 12:28:19 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "From 3D printed organs to the impact of the Affordable Care Act, here's what to expect in the year ahead.", "title": "7 health predictions for 2014 | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/01/01/7-health-predictions-for-2014.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2014/01/01/7-health-predictions-for-2014/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422638900219.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2014-01-01", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/HEALTH/HEALTHY LIVING\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"health\",\"title\":\"7 health predictions for 2014\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/health/2014/01/01/7-health-predictions-for-2014/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-1.img.jpg/0/0/1422638900219.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-01-01T11:30:01Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/health/2014/01/01/7-health-predictions-for-2014.html\",\"post_id\":\"e9fce7e0-b78c-4c03-ab0d-b45e4213a77f\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"health\"}"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3026\"", "article_summary": "Whether we're talking about treatment breakthroughs, medical research, or changes in healthcare policy, it's clear that 2013 was a big year for health news.\nDustin Sulak, an osteopath who prescribes medical marijuana in Maine, expects to see the nation continue to embrace the plant for its health benefits.\nHere are seven predictions from experts across the healthcare spectrum.\nAlmost all of a person's health information will be available and exchanged online.\nDr. Mark Smith, president and CEO of the California Healthcare Foundation, polled his colleagues on the issue of ACA's first year."}
