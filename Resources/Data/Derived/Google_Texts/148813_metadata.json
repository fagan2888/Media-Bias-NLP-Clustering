Republicans have enjoyed themselves immensely during the Affordable Care Act\u2019s bungled rollout, but most of the claims they\u2019re making are preposterous and phony. Since anyone able to take a longer view knows we\u2019ll one day be well past Obamacare\u2019s self-inflicted wounds, I\u2019d like as a public service to catalog the GOP\u2019s shabbiest arguments, so we\u2019ll all have a handy reference once the worm fully turns.\n\nThe selective \u201chumanitarian crisis.\u201d Conservatives have warned of the \u201chumanitarian disaster\u201d that will ensue if several million people with cancelled policies are unable to secure new coverage before January 1. But this theoretical woe (which will almost certainly be avoided thanks to Web site fixes and policy extensions) pales next to the much larger humanitarian disaster of America\u2019s nearly 50 million uninsured \u2014 a crisis that\u2019s persisted for decades without conservatives caring a whit. I can\u2019t be the only one who finds the right\u2019s sudden concern for a small subset of the uninsured a bit rich.\n\nThe bogus oppression of the young and healthy. Another confused conservative trope bemoans the enslavement of younger or healthier Americans, who\u2019ve supposedly been conscripted to subsidize their older, sicker countrymen. \u201cLiberals justify these coercive cross-subsidies as necessary to finance coverage for the uninsured and those with pre-existing conditions,\u201d the Wall Street Journal editorialized last Saturday. \u201cBut government usually helps the less fortunate honestly by raising taxes to fund programs.\u201d Actually, the Journal has the American way of health subsidy exactly wrong. Most people aged 19 to 34 who have health coverage get it from their employer. And, as I\u2019ve noted before, at nearly every firm, young people pay the same premiums as employees who are older and get more expensively sick. In other words, Obama\u2019s scheme to rob Peter to fund health care for Paul already exists, at vastly larger scale, in corporate America. And while Obamacare is only hoping to sign up 2 million or so young people, 20 million Americans aged 19 to 34 get their coverage on the job. Where\u2019s the Wall Street Journal\u2019s rant against corporate America\u2019s \u201ccoercive cross-subsidies\u201d? And while we\u2019re at it, when will we stop making all those people whose houses don\u2019t burn down subsidize those whose do?\n\nThe \u201cmen and 55 year old women don\u2019t need maternity care\u201d fallacy. Well, yes, and people whose genes don\u2019t predispose them to cancer (which tests will reveal soon enough) don\u2019t need cancer coverage. As Bob Kocher, a doctor and former senior Obama health care advisor, explained, if one of our goals is to not charge women higher premiums than men, all plans have to cover maternity. Among younger women, moreover, maternity is the biggest driver of costs \u2014 so if you allow optional coverage, the plans young people buy would be super-expensive. \u201cFor insurance to work, you can\u2019t allow people to opt into benefits like maternity right before they get pregnant,\u201d Kocher adds. \u201cWhen spread across the population, it\u2019s not expensive.\u201d Sounds like Insurance 101. Which in the social insurance context, conservatives can\u2019t abide.\n\nInsurance \u201cbailout\u201d baloney. Sen. Marco Rubio talks opportunistically (but I repeat myself) of Obama\u2019s pledge to \u201cbail out\u201d health plans if the folks they sign up end up being unduly costly to treat. Once again, conservatives eat their own. Such \u201crisk adjustment\u201d \u2014 after-the-fact payments to reflect the actual vs. expected risk experience of health plans \u2014 has been a sensible staple of conservative insurance market reforms since George H.W. Bush proposed it in 1992. Little known but true: Before Romneycare begat Obamacare, Bushcare begat Romneycare. Rubio was only 21 then. He must not know. Or care.\n\nThe \u201cObama is taking over one-sixth of the economy\u201d ruse. In the Fox News cocoon, this truth is self-evident. But it makes as much sense as crying that Ben Bernanke is \u201cremaking 6/6ths of the economy\u201d every time the Fed touches interest rates. The fact that health-care spending is 18 percent of GDP doesn\u2019t mean Obama is \u201cremaking\u201d or \u201ctaking over\u201d anything. He\u2019s tweaking a dysfunctional corner of the market where 5 percent of us get our health coverage. He\u2019s also testing ideas that health gurus in both parties have long suggested might help reign in future costs.\n\nWorse than these GOP fallacies is the party\u2019s smug sanctimony. It\u2019s as if conservatives have decided to parody the moral preening they loathe in liberals, except that the right is serious. As one pundit lectured, \u201cthe administration didn\u2019t care enough to make sure the people of their country were protected. In the middle of a second age of anxiety they decided to make America more anxious.\u201d\n\nYes, the rollout was botched. But what is this person talking about? Finally assuring that illness in the United States can\u2019t be the cause of financial ruin is the very essence of \u201cprotection.\u201d How galling that conservatives can make such hollow charges while putting forward no plan of their own to \u201cprotect\u201d anyone from anything!\n\nOr take the pundit who wrote that \u201cextending enrollment periods does nothing but provide Americans more time to contemplate their miserable choices.\u201d Only someone with no empathy \u2014 someone who has never tried and failed to get coverage in the individual market \u2014 could possibly say such a thing.\n\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time over the years arguing that we can solve big problems such as providing insurance coverage in ways that honor both liberal and conservative values. It\u2019s entirely doable \u2014 John Rawls and Milton Friedman can be reconciled, trust me. Apart from being sound policy, I\u2019ve assumed such approaches would also be necessary, because with power closely divided in the United States, we\u2019d need to strike big cross-party deals to make progress. The breathtaking intellectual and moral dishonesty of those driving the Obamacare debate in the GOP today makes me feel foolish for having tried.\n\nRead more from Matt Miller\u2019s archive or follow him on Twitter.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Matt Miller, obamacare, affordable care act, republicans health insurance, maternity coverage", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The greatest hits of baseless attacks on Obamacare.", "title": "Matt Miller: Republican fallacies on Obamacare", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-republican-fallacies-on-obamacare/2013/12/04/49b2a71a-5ce7-11e3-be07-006c776266ed_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/12/03/Technology/Images/115278454-1529.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-republican-fallacies-on-obamacare/2013/12/04/49b2a71a-5ce7-11e3-be07-006c776266ed_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Matt Miller, obamacare, affordable care act, republicans health insurance, maternity coverage", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "eomportal-uuid": "49b2a71a-5ce7-11e3-be07-006c776266ed", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "description": "The greatest hits of baseless attacks on Obamacare."}, "article_summary": "In other words, Obama\u2019s scheme to rob Peter to fund health care for Paul already exists, at vastly larger scale, in corporate America.\nMost people aged 19 to 34 who have health coverage get it from their employer.\nHe\u2019s tweaking a dysfunctional corner of the market where 5 percent of us get our health coverage.\nThe \u201cmen and 55 year old women don\u2019t need maternity care\u201d fallacy.\nI\u2019ve spent a lot of time over the years arguing that we can solve big problems such as providing insurance coverage in ways that honor both liberal and conservative values."}
