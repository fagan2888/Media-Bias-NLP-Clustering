(AP)\n\nPresident Obama is no stranger to heckling. He was heckled in 2013 when he discussed plans to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. He was heckled last year when he discussed changes to immigration policy. And perhaps most famously, he was heckled in 2009 by Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.), who shouted \u201cYou lie!\u201d at Obama during a speech to Congress about what would become the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut rarely do presidential hecklers not legislating on Capitol Hill get a chance to explain their actions \u2014 and none in recent memory has been as favorably received by the left as Jennicet Guti\u00e9rrez, who interrupted Obama at the White House on Wednesday.\n\n[A short history of President Obama\u2019s recent heckler encounters]\n\nObama was giving a speech for Pride month celebrating LGBT rights when Guti\u00e9rrez tried to cut him short.\n\n\u201cI am a trans woman!\u201d she shouted. \u201c\u2026 No more deportation!\u201d There were cheers and shouts of \u201cObama!\u201d as the president \u2014 often adept at silencing rowdy crowds \u2014 shut down the interruption and had Guti\u00e9rrez escorted out. Obama said he was fine with a few hecklers, but not when he was \u201cup in the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, my attitude is if you\u2019re eating the hors d\u2019oeuvres,\u201d he said, \u201cand drinking the booze \u2026 Anyway, where was I?\u201d\n\nBut not long after Obama made jokes, some were defending Guti\u00e9rrez. She\u2019s a 29-year-old transgender activist from Los Angeles \u2014 an undocumented immigrant trying to bring attention to the plight of trans women in immigration detention centers.\n\nIn a telephone interview with The Washington Post, Guti\u00e9rrez said she was overcome with emotion during Obama\u2019s speech, and that her outburst was spontaneous.\n\n\u201cI had to interrupt,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed at this coming from one of the great leaders of the nation. I thought he would have handled it differently \u2014 the way he started telling me to quiet down. It was a clear sign that he wouldn\u2019t listen. \u2026 I had to say what I felt at that particular moment.\u201d\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez elaborated on the interaction in \u201cI interrupted Obama because we need to be heard,\u201d an editorial that appeared the Washington Blade.\n\n\u201cI was fortunate to be invited to the White House to listen to President Obama\u2019s speech recognizing the LGBTQ community and the progress being made,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez wrote. \u201cBut while he spoke of \u2018trans women of color being targeted,\u2019 his administration holds LGBTQ and trans immigrants in detention. I spoke out because our issues and struggles can no longer be ignored.\u201d\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez would seem to understand those issues intimately. She said she was born in Mexico and came the United States when she was 15, transitioning three years ago. She said she is awaiting the outcome of immigration petition filed on her behalf by her sister, who is a citizen, but is \u201cbasically undocumented.\u201d\n\n\u201cI started getting into activism because of the violence trans woman face, especially women of color,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to do it for awhile, but I didn\u2019t because I wasn\u2019t embracing who I was.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pin down how many transgender detainees are in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). One investigative report by Fusion, which is affiliated with Univision, said one of every 500 detainees is transgender; given that ICE has about 34,000 people in detention, that would mean almost 70 transgender detainees. In 2013, meanwhile, the Government Accountability Office reported transgender detainees are disproportionately at risk of sexual assault \u2014 in 15 cases of \u201csustained sexual assault\u201d the GAO documented between October 2009 and March 2013, three victims were transgender.\n\nGuti\u00e9rrez said she and Los Angeles advocates were aware of 26 transgender detainees at California\u2019s Santa Ana detention center. She said that there is a special housing unit for LGBTQ detainees, but that sometimes these individuals have contact with other parts of the prison population, are placed in solitary confinement, face harassment from prison staff, and are punished when they speak out about conditions. She also pointed to the case of a transgender woman in Arizona allegedly detained with men earlier this year.\n\n\n\nJennicet Guti\u00e9rrez. (Courtesy of Jennicet Guti\u00e9rrez)\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to acknowledge our gender expression,\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez said, pointing out that she had never been in a detention center. \u201c\u2026 They can start harassing us because our bodies are changing with our hormones.\u201d\n\nThough not immediately available to comment about conditions at Santa Ana, ICE has offered progressive statements about its treatment of transgender detainees in the past.\n\n\u201cWe have a special housing unit in the Los Angeles area dedicated to the gay, bisexual and transgender detainees,\u201d Kevin Landy, the assistant director of the ICE office of detention policy and planning, said in January. \u201cIndividuals who prefer a transfer even across the country to that facility for their safety rather than being in a general population housing unit are afforded that opportunity, and we have transferred many people long distances at their choice to that unit.\u201d\n\nMoreover, Landy said detainees have access to hormone therapy \u2014 a comment that inspired headlines in conservative media such as \u201cGreat news! YOUR tax money is paying for HORMONE THERAPY of TRANSGENDER illegal aliens caught by ICE!\u201d\n\n\u201cWith respect to treatment while in detention \u2014 the medical care standard \u2014 the standards guarantees a right to hormone therapy for individuals who need it for treatment, and even in facilities that are not covered by that standard,\u201d Landy said. He said the agency \u201cis very vigilant on that issue to ensuring that individuals receive necessary hormone therapy,\u201d and added that \u201cat any given time on average, only one transgender detainee is in segregation in our entire system for more than 14 days at a time.\u201d\n\nWhatever the merits of Guti\u00e9rrez\u2019s complaint, she found friends in corners of the Internet perhaps not used to defending Obama hecklers, including a profile in People.\n\n\u201cI could see myself as a transgender US immigrant in a roomful of LGBT people,\u201d Meredith Talusan wrote in the Guardian, \u201cwanting to celebrate the president\u2019s actions to advance the cause of gay marriage, trans healthcare and trans people serving in the military, but being unable to shut my mouth because of the deplorable conditions that undocumented LGBT immigrants, especially trans women, face.\u201d Subhed: \u201c\u2018You\u2019re eating my hors d\u2019oeuvres\u2019 is hardly a response to a trans community that is routinely subject to harassment and violence.\u201d\n\nLate Thursday, Guti\u00e9rrez explained what she was going to say before she was so rudely interrupted by the president.\n\n\u201cWhat I was saying to President Obama was \u2018release all LGBTQ detainees in detention centers and stop the abuse,'\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez said. \u201cBecause you know we\u2019re just trying to \u2026 contribute to the nation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"He wouldn\u2019t listen,\" activist Jennicet Guti\u00e9rrez said.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "\"He wouldn\u2019t listen,\" activist Jennicet Guti\u00e9rrez said.", "title": "Transgender Obama heckler Jennicet Guti\u00e9rrez hailed by some LGBT activists", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/26/transgender-obama-heckler-hailed-by-some-lgbt-activists/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2015/06/IMG_0341.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@justinwmmoyer"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/26/transgender-obama-heckler-hailed-by-some-lgbt-activists/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obama, heckler, lgbt, pride month, Jennicet Guti\u00e9rrez", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obama, heckler, lgbt, pride month, Jennicet Guti\u00e9rrez"}, "article_summary": "A heckler protesting U.S. immigration policy was removed during President Obama address at a White House reception in celebration of Pride month.\n\u201cWhat I was saying to President Obama was \u2018release all LGBTQ detainees in detention centers and stop the abuse,'\u201d Guti\u00e9rrez said.\nGuti\u00e9rrez said she and Los Angeles advocates were aware of 26 transgender detainees at California\u2019s Santa Ana detention center.\nShe\u2019s a 29-year-old transgender activist from Los Angeles \u2014 an undocumented immigrant trying to bring attention to the plight of trans women in immigration detention centers.\n\u201cBut while he spoke of \u2018trans women of color being targeted,\u2019 his administration holds LGBTQ and trans immigrants in detention."}
