Photo: AFP\n\nCricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards has described as \"deeply concerning\" the crisis that led to the West Indies quitting their tour of India over a pay row with their board, resulting in fears about their participation in this summer's World Cup and their future as a Test-playing nation.\n\nWith the Board of Control for Cricket in India reportedly preparing to claim damages of at least $US65 million ($74 million) over lost earnings from the abandoned tour \u2013 and forecasting the cancellation of India's series in the Caribbean in 2016 \u2013 the former powerhouse of world cricket could be dealt a fatal financial blow. And while the sad decline of the West Indies has reached a new low, there are implications for Australia, who are due to tour there next autumn before an Ashes series in England. Australia are then scheduled to host the eighth-ranked Test nation for a Test and limited-overs series in the summer of 2015-16.\n\nBefore that there is also the issue of the World Cup, being staged in Australia and New Zealand in February and March.\n\nGlory days: West Indies captain Clive Lloyd dives for a catch in 1979.

I would say that India's next tour of West Indies is highly unlikely to go ahead in the current situation.\n\n\"Whatever the dispute, they should have honoured the bilateral agreement. We have suffered huge losses and the ICC is our parent body and we are going to ask them to ensure that this never happens in the future.\"\n\nAs the ICC scrambles for a solution and the WICB ready for an emergency board meeting on Tuesday, Edwards said the dispute needed to be sorted out urgently. \"Put simply, players and boards must fulfil their commitments to the Future Tours Programme,\" Edwards said.\"Situations such as these have to be avoided at all costs because ultimately those that are affected most are the people that the game depends on so heavily \u2013 cricket lovers, key broadcasters and commercial partners. For the game's sake, this needs to be resolved as soon as possible.\"\n\nWhile the West Indies' immediate future is unclear, their women's team this week begin a month-long tour of Australia featuring four T20s and four ODIs against the Southern Stars.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cricket", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards has described as &quot;deeply concerning&quot; the crisis that has seen the West Indies abandon their tour of India over a pay dispute, resulting in fears about their participation in this summer's World Cup and their future as a Test-playing nation.", "title": "West Indies' future looks grim after Indian board hits them with $74 million damages bill", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/cricket/west-indies-future-looks-grim-after-indian-board-hits-them-with-74-million-damages-bill-20141019-118b90.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/1/8/d/d/3/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.118b90.png/1413725974645.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/1/1/8/d/d/3/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.118b90.png/1413725974645.jpg"}, "title": "West Indies' future looks grim after Indian board hits them with $74 million damages bill", "description": "Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards has described as \"deeply concerning\" the crisis that has seen the West Indies abandon their tour of India over a pay dispute, resulting in fears about their participation in this summer's World Cup and their future as a Test-playing nation.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@smh"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "Cricket Australia chairman Wally Edwards has described as \"deeply concerning\" the crisis that has seen the West Indies abandon their tour of India ..."}, "article_summary": "Shaky future: West Indies batsman Shivnarine Chanderpaul goes for a sweep against Bangladesh in September.\nWhile that could bring them to their knees, the West Indies Cricket Board bizarrely used Twitter on Sunday to re-advertise its vacant head coaching position.\n\"It will be very difficult to play West Indies in bilateral series in future,\" BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel told Reuters.\nI would say that India's next tour of West Indies is highly unlikely to go ahead in the current situation.\nGlory days: West Indies captain Clive Lloyd dives for a catch in 1979."}
