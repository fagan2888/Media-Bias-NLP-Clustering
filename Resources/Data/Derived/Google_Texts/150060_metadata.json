Health care is important. It's also important to have a president who has experience in foreign policy. I do remember when she was first lady and tried with her husband to reform health care. I support her support of the Affordable Care Act. Bernie Sanders would dismantle it into a single payer system. I prefer it, but it won't happen, and he is dismantling something that is working. While Sanders is straightforward regarding the use of big money and super PACS I guess Clinton is more electable in the end. As a professor of theology and women's studies, I'm pleased to see a strong woman candidate. She is someone with intelligence and experience in foreign policy and can speak intelligently on the issues. She is not just a reality show persona.
