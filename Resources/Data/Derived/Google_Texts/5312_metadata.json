Because Americans still aren\u2019t better off than they were six years ago.\n\nPresident Obama was right.\n\nOn October 2, he told a crowd at Northwestern University, \u201cI\u2019m not on the ballot this fall\u2026but make no mistake, these policies are on the ballot, every single one of them.\u201d Just in case the message didn\u2019t get through, he later reminded voters that the incumbent Democrats \u201care all folks who vote with me\u201d and \u201chave supported my agenda.\u201d\n\nTwo of those Democratic senators are now ex-Senators: Arkansas\u2019s Mark Pryor, North Carolina\u2019s Kay Hagan and soon Alaska\u2019s Mark Begich will join their ranks, once the final count is completed. And Louisiana\u2019s Mary Landrieu is in a run-off she will likely lose. Ed Gillespie came within a hair of defeating Virginia\u2019s Mark Warner, despite being massively outspent.\n\nIn probably the most Democratic state in the country, Maryland elected Larry Hogan the second Republican governor since 1969. (Disclosure: Hogan was a client of my firm\u2019s.) Republican Charlie Baker will be Massachusetts\u2019s new governor. In Barack Obama\u2019s Illinois, Republican Bruce Rauner defeated one of the few candidates Obama campaigned for, incumbent Governor Pat Quinn.\n\nBefore the historic election night was over, Harry Reid\u2019s chief of staff hurled the President under the bus: \u201cThe president\u2019s approval rating is barely 40 percent,\u201d David Krone, Reid\u2019s top aide told the Washington Post. \u201cWhat else more is there to say? He wasn\u2019t going to play well in North Carolina or Iowa or New Hampshire. I\u2019m sorry. It doesn\u2019t mean that the message was bad, but sometimes the messenger isn\u2019t good.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a nice try to save your boss (and Harry Reid is far more unpopular than President Obama) but the reality is that the president is unpopular precisely because of his message and policies. This is not a president suffering from personal scandals. He\u2019s unpopular not, as some have tried to suggest, because he is African American; he was African American when his popularity was near a record high seventy percent.\n\nVoters rejected the president\u2019s policies for the usual, very simple reason: few believe they are working. That can be survivable if a president acknowledges failures and takes steps to correct. But when a president seems determined to tell voters that they are wrong and he is right, voters usually respond negatively.\n\nYes, the stock market is booming but overwhelmingly Americans are unhappy with their economic situation\u2014and for good reason. Wages are stagnant and middle-class household incomes continue to decline. President Obama is on track to become the first president in history to leave office after two terms with fewer full time jobs than when he took office. The reduction in the unemployment levels is largely due to part time jobs and more people simply giving up looking for jobs.\n\n\u201cThe purchasing power of the typical American family is 3.1 percent lower now than it was five years ago,\u201d wrote The New York Times\u2019 Neil Irwin over the summer. \u201cNo wonder people are unhappy about the economy! The benefits of rising levels of economic activity have simply not accrued to middle-income wage earners.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that people feel the economy isn\u2019t working like it once did or should. It\u2019s not. Ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage passed in four states: Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota. It seems contradictory that voters would vote both for the initiatives and for candidates who oppose the initiatives\u2014as was the case in all four of these states\u2014but that dichotomy precisely reflects voters attitudes. The majority support raising the minimum wage but they don\u2019t see it as a long-term solution and don\u2019t trust Democrats to solve the underlying issues of the job crunch.\n\nDemocratic pollster Mark Mellman told Greg Sargent of the Washington Post, \u201cWe\u2019ve been promising that government can be a tool to improve people\u2019s economic situation for decades, and by and large, it hasn\u2019t happened.\u201d\n\nSo what happens now? Republicans must provide positive alternatives. President Obama has vetoed only three bills, an historic low. It seems safe to assume that will soon change. Republicans must seize this opportunity to pass legislation to improve the economic stagnation. That should include an alternative to Obamacare, and not just a repeal.\n\nIf the President vetoes these bills\u2014as he surely will for an Obamacare alternative\u2014it will still serve the useful purpose of changing the terms of the debate. There will be two opposing approaches and voters in 2016 will have a clearer choice. Do they prefer the Republican alternatives or the President\u2019s agenda?\n\nFor both Parties, this involves considerable risk. If Republicans blow it and fail to pass significant legislation, that will be a huge lost opportunity and damaging for 2016. If the President continues to insist that his current course is the right one, it could prove crippling for both the country and Democratic chances in 2016.\n\nNot so long ago, many were predicting that the government shutdown would kill Republican chances in 2014. But the American political memory is rarely long-term. By the summer of 2016, what happened on Tuesday will be long forgotten. Voters will experience the outcome of this election in very personal terms. If they believe change has bettered their lives, 2016 could be another good day for Republicans. If they don\u2019t, the pain of tomorrow\u2019s defeat will overwhelm the joy of yesterday\u2019s victory.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, 2014 Midterms, u.s. poli, District of Columbia, 2014 Election", "publicationDate": 201411061045, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama, 2014 Midterms, US Politics, District of Columbia, 2014 Election", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Voters Remind D.C.
