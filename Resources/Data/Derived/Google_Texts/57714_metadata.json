IRS preps for employer mandate\n\nThe Obama administration signaled Thursday it\u2019s not backing down from the controversial health law employer mandate that has been delayed twice and is the centerpiece of the House\u2019s lawsuit against the president.\n\nThe IRS posted drafts of the forms that employers will have to fill out to comply with the Obamacare requirement that employers provide health insurance to workers.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSome business groups said the information was still too tentative and too incomplete to let them prepare for new obligations under the health law. \u201cOur immense frustrations with the IRS continue,\u201d Christine Pollack, vice president of Government Affairs at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, said in a statement.\n\nAn administration official said the White House is sticking to the timeline announced earlier this year. Companies with 50 to 99 employees will have another year \u2014 until 2016 \u2014 to start the coverage. Companies with 100 or more employees do have to comply next year, although they have two years to phase up so that they are covering 95 percent of their workers. Smaller businesses are exempt.\n\nThe House Republicans are planning to sue President Barack Obama, saying he overstepped his authority in delaying the employer mandate. The GOP opposes the policy and has voted to repeal it, but Republicans still say it\u2019s a prime example of presidential overreach.\n\nThe business community has been complaining about the complexity of the coverage rules and the lack of specifics. The draft forms the IRS released Thursday were more streamlined than the agency had earlier indicated. Three categories of information have been dropped. Employers can do a one-time checkoff for people covered year round, instead of filling out reports for everyone every month. And self-insured employers \u2014 those that assume the whole cost of their coverage \u2014 will fill out one form, not two.\n\nHowever some business groups still had their worries, particularly as the instructions won\u2019t be published until next month.\n\n\u201cThe IRS only released draft forms, with no instructions or technical specifications. For the longest time, retailers have been pounding their heads, asking for this information from the IRS in order to get their systems up and running and comply with these requirements beginning this January. Yet again, it\u2019s too little, too late for employers,\u201d Pollack said.\n\nThe administration has estimated that the mandate will only apply to about 4 percent of employers. Most larger firms already offer health benefits.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The Obama administration signals it won't back down from the health law employer mandate.", "title": "IRS preps for employer mandate", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/07/irs-prepping-obamacare-employer-mandate-2015-109359.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/06/10/obamacare_aca_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama,Obamacare,House Republicans,White House,IRS,Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The Obama administration signals it won't back down from the health law employer mandate.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce0d0\"", "article_summary": "IRS preps for employer mandateThe Obama administration signaled Thursday it\u2019s not backing down from the controversial health law employer mandate that has been delayed twice and is the centerpiece of the House\u2019s lawsuit against the president.\nThe House Republicans are planning to sue President Barack Obama, saying he overstepped his authority in delaying the employer mandate.\nHowever some business groups still had their worries, particularly as the instructions won\u2019t be published until next month.\nSome business groups say information was still too incomplete for new obligations.\nThe IRS posted drafts of the forms that employers will have to fill out to comply with the Obamacare requirement that employers provide health insurance to workers."}
