Trump wasn\u2019t his first handcrafted butt plug, though \u2014 that honor belongs to Vladmir Putin, and Sosa has created countless other satirical sex toys, featuring such leaders as George W. Bush, Kim Jun Un, Chris Christie, and Fred Phelps.\n\nDespite all the publicity the artist has received for his Trump plug, it\u2019s an apolitical figurine \u2014 Left Shark, of Katy Perry Super Bowl fame \u2014 that has landed him in the most trouble of his career. Sosa is embroiled in an ongoing legal battle with Katy Perry, whose attorneys sent him a cease-and-desist notice over his 3D-printed Left Shark, making a claim Sosa\u2019s lawyer has called \u201cvery dubious\u201d: that she owns the copyright on a costume that became an Internet meme.\n\nFlavorwire spoke to Sosa about Trump, Perry, and the role his identity plays in his artwork.\n\nFlavorwire: What was going through your head when you read what Donald Trump said about Mexicans?\n\nFernando Sosa: I feel really proud to be both American and Mexican, especially after the Donald Trump comments. Trump said, [in effect,] \u201cI\u2019m not saying all Mexicans are drug-dealers and rapists. Just the illegals.\u201d But [whether] somebody crossed the border through a plane or through the river, we\u2019re all the same people. The only reason I\u2019m even here legally is because my stepdad is an American citizen. He met my mom in Mexico. They fell in love and then he brought us here, which is really rare.\n\nI notice you say \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201cillegals.\u201d Lots of people say \u201cundocumented.\u201d\n\nI was trying to say \u201cundocumented\u201d instead of \u201cillegal,\u201d because people cannot be illegal as a whole. But when you say \u201cundocumented\u201d in Cali or New York, maybe people know what you mean. When I say it [in Florida], people don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nI don\u2019t know if this will work, but I want to take the word back from the people saying it in a negative way. Just like with \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 I think we have to say \u201cillegal\u201d and make it better.\n\nHow would you describe your identity?\n\nI consider myself American and Mexican. It\u2019s kind of like walking and chewing gum at the same time. People say, \u2018Why you doing this Cinco de Mayo thing?\u2019 But they don\u2019t say that to people who are of Irish descent and celebrate St. Patrick\u2019s Day.\n\nI love Mexican culture, music and food. I love tacos \u2014 but street tacos. That\u2019s how I was able to win over my Filipino wife. I would cook Mexican food for her.\n\nI left Mexico when I was 11, but I went to school for traditional arts, and I studied some Mexican artists and fresco art, like Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, who is really big where I\u2019m from, Puebla.\n\nHow did you get started making 3D art?\n\nI started out making slim wallets for phones that had bottle openers and money clips. I own my own business. The political stuff was more of a hobby. But I was able to sell [those works], too.\n\nHow did you become involved in politics?\n\nA progressive friend of mine from school invited me to an Alan Grayson town hall. And I was on line outside, waiting to go in, and I hear this lady telling another guy on line, \u201cI\u2019m a cancer survivor but I don\u2019t have insurance \u2014 that\u2019s why we need the Affordable Care Act.\u201d And he was screaming at her, \u201cI don\u2019t want to pay for your healthcare.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWhy is this guy being such a butthole?\u201d I started reading up on the Affordable Care Act, and I started to do canvassing, and the more I learned about it, the more I got involved.\n\nWhy did you decide to start making butt plugs in the shape of political leaders?\n\nMy first butt plug was for Putin. They were trying to pass the gay propaganda law, so I was really angry. Putin spends a lot of time and money on propaganda to build an image. If you destroy that image, you can bring him down to a level that people can rise up against. So I was thinking, \u201cWhat is something that is insulting for him? What about a butt plug with his face on it?\u201d That has to be the best way to insult a homophobe. If somebody made a butt plug of me, I wouldn\u2019t care. But if you\u2019re a homophobic person\u2026 I think I woke up at three o\u2019clock in the morning and started 3D modeling it.\n\nIt\u2019s also kind of like a voodoo doll; you can either put little pins in him or you can stick him in someone else\u2019s butt.\n\nWhat does your family think of the butt plugs you\u2019ve made?\n\nMy dad is from Finland, and he really hates Putin because Russia invaded them. And he\u2019s older, and that\u2019s a hard demographic [that] doesn\u2019t know much about the butt plug thing. When I explained it to him, he was laughing, like, \u201cOh yeah, I hate that guy.\u201d\n\nMy mom thought it was weird in the beginning. I had to explain it to her: people in Russia are passing laws against gay people. She used to have a stylist who was really famous in Mexico. And I was like, \u201cTe acuerdas del stylist que te hacia el cabello? [Remember the stylist who did your hair?]. Well, just imagine, in Russia they could put him in jail just because he\u2019s gay.\u201d And she was like, \u201cOh, well, I don\u2019t like that.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWell, this [butt plug] is putting attention on that, and it\u2019s ridiculing this leader.\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, I like that\u2026. And you\u2019re making money? Oh, I like that part too.\u201d\n\nWhich other political figures have you mocked?\n\nI have a \u201cMission Accomplished George Bush.\u201d He\u2019s riding a rocket, and the rocket is burning money and has blood stains on it because of Iraq. Then I have the Kim Jong Un butt plug. A lot of people buy it for presents.\n\nYou could do an airdrop of those over North Korea.\n\nThey\u2019re kind of like missiles if you turn them upside down.\n\n\u201cOne man\u2019s butt plug is another man\u2019s missile,\u201d like the old saying goes.\n\nAnything is a butt plug if you\u2019re brave enough.\n\nDid you just think of that?\n\nNo. I know so many puns by now about butt plugs. I also have this Fred Phelps [butt plug], from Westboro Baptist. And Mitch McTurtle, of Mitch McConnell. People like turtles, so they keep buying them even if they don\u2019t know it\u2019s Mitch McTurtle. The Chris Christie Bridgegate inaction figure is a big seller. Especially because it was on Hardball with Chris Matthews.\n\nHas Donald Trump officially responded to the butt plug?\n\nI called his office, and asked the lady who picked up if he wanted one. She hasn\u2019t gotten back to me.\n\nWhen I made the Chris Christie figurine, I called his office and said, \u201cI\u2019ve made a Chris Christie Bridgegate inaction figure, and I\u2019d like to know if Chris Christie would like to get one.\u201d The lady couldn\u2019t keep her face straight. You could hear her giggling.\n\nHas anyone else you\u2019ve depicted responded?\n\nNo. Except for Katy Perry\u2019s lawyers. One of my biggest sellers was the Left Shark 3D-printed inaction figure. I made it two days after the Super Bowl and the Left Shark thing happened. And they were selling really well. Two days after I started selling, the website selling them got a cease-and-desist order saying Perry owned the copyright. And so they took it down.\n\nI thought, why would they have owned the copyright? They didn\u2019t know that one of the sharks was going to mess up and go viral. And I thought, \u201cOK, that\u2019s kinda fishy.\u201d\n\nNo pun intended!\n\nI didn\u2019t realize that! CNN had a story about it, and a lawyer contacted me and told Perry\u2019s lawyers they didn\u2019t have copyright. They said they did, because somebody drew a sketch of it a long time ago. My lawyer was like, \u201cMy client didn\u2019t base his 3d figure from this sketch, because he never saw it. He based it on the costume, which is not copyrightable.\u201d Copyright protects a lot of stuff, but it doesn\u2019t protect usable items or wearable items, so the way that people get around it is they trademark it. Then they tried to trademark [the Left Shark design], but it got shot down by the trademark office because the drawing of the Left Shark was so crappy.\n\nSo, she didn\u2019t have copyright or trademark but she was still telling other people that they couldn\u2019t sell it.\n\nHave you considered making a Katy Perry butt plug?\n\nWell, I\u2019m trying to come to an agreement amicably.
