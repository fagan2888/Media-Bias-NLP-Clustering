Scott\u2019s shot bounced off the front of the rim, but he grabbed the rebound and tied the score with his putback.\n\n\u201cI remember him cheating and stepping over the line before anyone else could,\u201d Gordon said with a grin. \u201cThat\u2019s about it.\u201d\n\nA review of the tape makes Gordon\u2019s claim questionable, at best. Scott appeared to bolt forward just as the ball hit the rim. Besides, the 6-foot-10 Scott can let his championship ring do the talking.\n\nBut the fact there is still good-natured ribbing about the high school days between Buffs teammates is music to the ears of CU coach Tad Boyle.\n\n\u201cThe one thing about Colorado kids is they all know each other,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cThey play against each other growing up, during AAU in the summertime.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got great arguments in our locker room about who\u2019s better between Sterling and Sierra and Lewis-Palmer. They all played in this building (CU\u2019s Coors Events Center) in the state tournament. You get banter like that.\u201d\n\nAs Boyle nears the end of his sixth season at CU, with the Buffs chasing what would be the fourth NCAA Tournament appearance of his tenure, he continues to rely on the talent of in-state players.\n\nRecently against Oregon State, four Colorado players \u2014 Gordon, Scott and guards Dom Collier (Denver East) and Xavier Talton (Sterling) \u2014 were in CU\u2019s starting lineup. The CU staff also recently received a verbal commitment from Arvada West 7-footer Dallas Walton. And the Buffs have made a scholarship offer to the state\u2019s top-ranked junior, 6-6 forward D\u2019Shawn Schwartz of Sand Creek High School in Colorado Springs.\n\nThe success Boyle began building upon the impressive 2012 class of Scott, Gordon and Talton shows little sign of slowing.\n\n\u201cWhen I got the job 5\u00bd years ago, I made the statement that we are the University of Colorado and if there\u2019s a young man in this state that will help us win Pac-12 championships and go to NCAA Tournaments, we\u2019re going to recruit him,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cWe felt that way about Dom (Collier). We felt that way about Xavier Talton. We felt that way about Wesley (Gordon), and we feel that way about some kids in the state right now. We are always going to recruit the state of Colorado first and foremost.\u201d\n\nSchwartz, a four-star recruit who is averaging 19.7 points and 8.6 rebounds per game this season, said the success Boyle has had with players from all corners of the state is intriguing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something to be confident in when you\u2019re being recruited,\u201d said Schwartz, who has already taken a number of visits to CU and also has scholarship offers from Weber State, VCU, Utah State and UNLV. \u201cA lot of people say you can\u2019t make it out of this part of town. It definitely gives you confirmation that you can.\u201d\n\nThis state isn\u2019t chock-full of major- conference talent every year. So far, Walton and Indiana-bound big man De\u2019Ron Davis of Overland, a 6-10 post player the Buffs recruited heavily, are the only players in the state\u2019s 2016 class who have committed to major-conference Division I programs. And the state\u2019s 2015 class had no players receive scholarships to schools at that level.\n\n\u201cI always say this: Colorado, from a basketball standpoint, is a cyclical state,\u201d Boyle said. \u201cSome years are going to be better than others. Some years are going to be deeper than others in terms of Division I talent.\u201d\n\nWith the exception of Davis, Boyle and his staff have been successful recruiting just about every in-state player they have targeted, success built on relationships that are founded on being straight shooters.\n\n\u201cI liked that he was just very honest,\u201d Walton said of what he enjoyed most about Boyle\u2019s recruiting approach. \u201cHis honesty stood out to me the most. He never really beat around the bush like some colleges do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very consistent,\u201d added Schwartz, who has yet to commit to a college program. \u201cThey\u2019ll text you when you have a bad game. They\u2019ll text you when you have a good game. They\u2019re very honest in what they have to say.\u201d\n\nThe current Colorado players suiting up for the Buffs believe their success the last four years will open the eyes of the state\u2019s next wave of talented players.\n\n\u201cJust the momentum we\u2019ve gained, I think we\u2019ve earned national attention a little bit,\u201d Talton said. \u201cThat\u2019s opening kids\u2019 eyes to want to partake in something like that and stay close to home.\u201d\n\nNick Kosmider: 303-954-1516, nkosmider@denverpost.com or @nickkosmider", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wesley Gordon and Josh Scott provide homegrown help for Buffaloes", "title": "Wesley Gordon and Josh Scott provide homegrown help for Buffaloes", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/20/wesley-gordon-and-josh-scott-provide-homegrown-help-for-buffaloes/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160220__BN20160221_CC9_BNSP21BKCCUBOYLEp1.jpg", "height": 491}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160220__BN20160221_CC9_BNSP21BKCCUBOYLEp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-20T18:32:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T04:20:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Colorado"}, "article_summary": "Recently against Oregon State, four Colorado players \u2014 Gordon, Scott and guards Dom Collier (Denver East) and Xavier Talton (Sterling) \u2014 were in CU\u2019s starting lineup.\nThe success Boyle began building upon the impressive 2012 class of Scott, Gordon and Talton shows little sign of slowing.\nWe felt that way about Wesley (Gordon), and we feel that way about some kids in the state right now.\n\u201cI always say this: Colorado, from a basketball standpoint, is a cyclical state,\u201d Boyle said.\nBOULDER \u2014 Wesley Gordon uses any opportunity he can to remind Colorado men\u2019s basketball teammate Josh Scott that the state title his Lewis-Palmer High School team captured in 2012 deserves an asterisk."}
