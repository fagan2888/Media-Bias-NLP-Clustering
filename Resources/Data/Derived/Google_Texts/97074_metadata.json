(AP Photo/Toby Talbot, File)\n\n3861672\n\nHome Depot is transferring roughly 20,000 part-time workers to the taxpayer-funded Obamacare exchanges, marking another step in the nationwide rollout of President Barack Obama\u2019s most prized accomplishment.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the ACA [Affordable Care Act] precludes us from offering the limited liability medical plan we\u2019ve been offering the part-time associates,\u201d said Stephen Holmes, the company\u2019s director of corporate communications.\n\nThe 20,000 employees will have more options on government-run exchanges, he told The Daily Caller.\n\nHome Depot Inc. employs roughly 340,000 people, but declined to give a precise number of people who will be impacted by the change.\n\nThe government-run exchange requires people to buy insurance for a government-designed set of health-care services, including services promoted by corporate lobbies. The insurance packages can be more expensive than sought by workers, especially younger workers, but the extra costs are partially offset by subsidies from other taxpayers.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s current limited liability plan allows part-timers to get critical health-care coverage at low cost.\n\nHome Depot\u2019s founder, Bernie Marcus, is a strong critic of the government network. \u201cObamacare is going to kill off small business,\u201d he said this year.\n\nThe accelerating shift of workers to Obama\u2019s taxpayer-funded network will likely drive up costs to taxpayers, disadvantage companies that try to pay for their employees\u2019 health-care and make more voters dependent on health-care decisions made by Democratic officials and legislators.\n\nThe switch is also making a mockery of Obama\u2019s promise that Americans would be able to keep their pre-Obamacare insurance if they prefer.\n\n\u201cIf you like your health care plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what,\u201d he said in June 2009.\n\nThis fall, GOP legislators and supporters are working to defund the Obamacare network, or to extend White House-imposed delays in the program to all Americans.\n\nRepublicans are also trying to craft their own free-market replacement for the government-run Obamacare network. The draft bill developed by the Republican Study Committee would provide large tax breaks to help all Americans buy health-care insurance in a nationwide market, and also provide a fund to aid people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nPolls show that a majority of Americans oppose the taxpayer-funded, government-run Obamacare network.\n\nHowever, the same polls also a lopsided majority of Americans are worried that a sudden end to Obamacare could be painful.\n\nWashington is girding for a high-stakes fight over Obamacare this fall. A majority of GOP legislators want a quick defund of the program, while Obama and his White House deputies claim that the GOP\u2019s opposition to the program is prompted by its desire to cut-back health care for ordinary Americans.\n\nFollow Neil on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Neil Munro", "description": "Home Depot Inc. is transferring roughly 20,000 part-time workers to the taxpayer-funded Obamacare exchanges.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Home Depot is transferring roughly 20,000 part-time workers to the taxpayer-funded Obamacare exchanges, marking another step in the nationwide rollout of President Barack Obama's most prized accomplis", "title": "Home Depot sends 20,000 employees into Obamacare", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/19/home-depot-sends-20000-employees-into-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/df1e2e8c6ba3442fbf17c01715d50a79-e1379603766958.jpg", "height": 275}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obamacare rules force thousands of employees into health exchanges", "title": "Home Depot sends 20,000 employees into Obamacare Via @dailycaller", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2013/09/19/home-depot-sends-20000-employees-into-obamacare/", "image": {"src": "http://dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/df1e2e8c6ba3442fbf17c01715d50a79-e1379603766958.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@dailycaller", "id": 39308549}, "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-09-19 11:30:46", "sailthru.title": "Home Depot sends 20,000 employees into Obamacare", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "sailthru.tags": "obamacare,neil-munro", "fb": {"app_id": 143489452702, "pages": 182919686769}, "keywords": "obamacare", "sailthru.description": "Home Depot is transferring roughly 20,000 part-time workers to the taxpayer-funded Obamacare exchanges, marking another step in the nationwide rollout of President Barack Obama's most prized accomplis", "sailthru.image.full": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/df1e2e8c6ba3442fbf17c01715d50a79-e1379603766958.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfc38\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf you like your health care plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your health care plan, period.\nRepublicans are also trying to craft their own free-market replacement for the government-run Obamacare network.\nPolls show that a majority of Americans oppose the taxpayer-funded, government-run Obamacare network.\nThis fall, GOP legislators and supporters are working to defund the Obamacare network, or to extend White House-imposed delays in the program to all Americans.\nThe 20,000 employees will have more options on government-run exchanges, he told The Daily Caller."}
