Brightly lit Times Square displays singing the praises of “Mamma Mia!” and “Wicked” find themselves with an unusual new companion this week, as the Heritage Foundation unveiled a billboard blasting Obamacare on 42nd Street.

The 90-foot-high, 67-foot-long billboard reads, “WARNING: Obamacare may be hazardous to your health,” and encourages viewers to support defunding the health-care law. The sign displays a number viewers can text to get more information.

The billboard comes on the heels of a tea party rally targeting Obamacare Tuesday afternoon that drew hundreds of protesters to the West Lawn of the Capitol.

Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint, who recently completed a two-week “Stop Obamacare” tour in nine cities, said the billboard is intended to publicly emphasize the message that Americans oppose the law. “People are losing their current coverage, they’re losing access to treatments that have helped them, they’re losing access to their long-time doctors, and their premiums are set to go through the roof,” he said in a written statement.

“Obamacare is becoming less popular … because it’s beginning to bite,” said Michael Gonzalez, vice president of communications at the Heritage, a conservative think tank.

“We want the billboard to get people thinking, to raise awareness,” Mr. Gonzalez said. “We expect the message to resonate with New Yorkers and visitors across the country. … Times Square is a mecca for people not just from the five boroughs, but from all 50 states.”

The billboard, which is posted between 7th and 8th Avenues for the next month, was slated to go up Monday evening but encountered technical delays. Heritage declined to say what it paid for the space.
