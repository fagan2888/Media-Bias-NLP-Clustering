In the First, Third and Fourth Congressional Districts, Republican incumbents are challenged only by Libertarian opponents.\n\nThis will be the third straight election cycle where the party will be fielding candidates below the presidential level. It ran 28 candidates in 2014 and is running 23 this year.\n\nOf course, fielding candidates is a lot different than winning elections. The best any Libertarian could manage in a three-way statewide or congressional race in 2014 was the 6.36% won by Chris Hayes in the treasurer\u2019s race, and in a two-way race in the Third District, Grant Brand won less than 21% facing incumbent Congressman Steve Womack. The party counts about a hundred dues-paying members at the state level and perhaps another hundred or so who are registered Libertarians but not active in the state party.\n\nSEEKING THREE PERCENT\n\nSo no one is expecting a Libertarian landslide. However, another number seems within reach: 3%. If the party\u2019s presidential candidate can hit that percentage in November, the Libertarians, founded nationally in 1971, will not be considered a \u201cnew\u201d party under state law during the 2018 election cycle. That would save the party from having to collect 10,000 valid signatures to qualify for the ballot, an exercise that cost $34,000 for this year\u2019s cycle as well as a lot of energy and legwork.\n\nThat percentage seems attainable this year, particularly if the two major parties nominate polarizing candidates like Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. In 2012, the Libertarians\u2019 candidate, Gary Johnson, the former Republican governor of New Mexico, won only 1.5% of the vote in Arkansas. But a recent national poll showed him at 11% this year.\n\n\u201cIf you can detach yourself from it and just look at it, it\u2019s really interesting, but since there\u2019s so much at stake, it\u2019s also a little terrifying,\u201d said Frank Gilbert, this year\u2019s Libertarian Senate candidate and the party\u2019s nominee for governor in 2014.\n\nWhat do Libertarians want to achieve? The party\u2019s chair, Dr. Michael Pakko, UALR Institute for Economic Advancement chief economist and state economic forecaster, describes the Libertarian philosophy as \u201cfiscally responsible and socially tolerant.\u201d\n\nLibertarians are the party of minimal government \u2013 to the right of Republicans on fiscal issues and to the left of Democrats socially. Pakko describes the party\u2019s coalition as being composed of three groups: small government constitutionalists, minanarchists who want minimal government and anarchists who want no government. Fundamentally, they agree on the \u201cnonaggression principle,\u201d meaning force should not be initiated to achieve social goals. So Libertarians as a party would stay out of personal decisions, shrink the military, support gun rights, end the drug war and abolish social programs such as Social Security and Medicare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because we don\u2019t think that those are valid objectives for society,\u201d Pakko said of the latter. \u201cOn an awful lot of issues, we can concede, yeah, that\u2019s a great idea. If it\u2019s such a good idea, maybe we should have someone more efficient than government implementing it.\u201d\n\nLibertarians are running candidates in all four House races: Mark West in the First District; Chris Hayes in the Second; Steve Isaacson in the Third; and Kerry Hicks in the Fourth. Two Libertarians are running in state Senate races: in District 26, Elvis Presley (yes, that\u2019s his real name); and in District 32, Jacob Mosier. Nine candidates are running for state House races, while seven are running for local offices.\n\nSUING THE STATE\n\nMeanwhile, the party is suing the state to get eight more candidates on the ballot. A state law requires the party to nominate its full slate by the end of the filing period. That law forced the party to hold its nominating convention for the November 2016 election in October 2015, while Republicans and Democrats didn\u2019t choose their candidates until March 1.\n\nOn Feb. 25, U.S. District Judge James Moody denied the party\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction allowing it to add or substitute nominees. He ruled that candidates had not been harmed by their early nominating date and that the state \u201chas a strong interest in preventing voter confusion by limiting ballot access to serious candidates.\u201d A trial date has not been set.\n\nMoody in 2015 rejected a similar lawsuit by independent candidates. But Pakko thinks the cases are different enough that the party has a shot of winning. To improve its chances and increase its legal standing, the party nominated eight additional candidates in February who are waiting to see if they will be allowed on the ballot.\n\nGilbert is running a grassroots campaign for Senate. As of early April, he had made about 20 campaign stops. Unlike many Libertarians, he\u2019s not philosophically opposed to raising money; it\u2019s just hard for third-party candidates to do so. In the 2014 governor\u2019s race, he raised about $5,000. He plans to be more active this year than he was then, and he was pretty active then.\n\n\u201cThat campaign to me was missionary work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an effort to find and build some local support. \u2026 I\u2019m not going to be doing missionary work this time. I want as many votes as I can get.\u201d\n\nFEELING HOPEFUL\n\nPakko sees reason for optimism. He sees more interest in the party this year, especially at the presidential level. Fox Business already has hosted two debates featuring the Libertarian candidates.\n\nGilbert is optimistic, too. He says members of the Tea Party traditionally have seen Libertarians as a distraction from their goal of changing the Republican Party from within. But the Republicans have made too many unkept promises, such as repealing Obamacare. At the state level, he notes that Republicans changed abortion law because they wanted to, but other things haven\u2019t yet changed, such as the private option, the program that uses federal Medicaid dollars to purchase private insurance for lower income Arkansans. As of this writing, Gov. Asa Hutchinson has been trying to extend the program with changes and a new name, Arkansas Works.\n\n\u201cThat part of the Republican Party that believed that Asa Hutchinson was going to end the private option, those folks are talking,\u201d Gilbert said.\n\nIn the First District, Mark West, an office manager and bi-vocational pastor, said he ran as a Libertarian because the party has the \u201cmost constitutional viewpoint.\u201d\n\nWest said his father worked hard to give him a better life, and he\u2019s afraid his own children are inheriting too much debt and not enough individual liberty.\n\n\u201cI believe that we should have the power to run our own lives, to make our own choices, and the only way to get there is to begin peeling away all these layers of federal government that are taking those rights away,\u201d he said.\n\nGiven the difficulties of running as a Libertarian, and the party\u2019s lack of historical success, why not run as a Republican or Democrat and try to move one of those parties in a more libertarian direction? West doesn\u2019t see much hope in that strategy.\n\n\u201cBoth parties aren\u2019t moving,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they were going to move, they would have moved decades ago. They have had opportunities. They\u2019ve had candidates that have tried to move them that direction, and both of those parties continue to drift toward a more authoritarian viewpoint of government, and neither one of them show any desire to want to do anything different.\u201d\n\nIn the Third District, Isaacson is a newcomer to the party. A Vietnam veteran who retired after 20 years in the military, he said he was run over by a tank in 1985 and spent more than 23 years fighting the Veterans Administration for his benefits. Veterans advocacy is his top concern, and he also promises a self-imposed limit of three terms.\n\nHe said he was approached about challenging Congressman Steve Womack for the Third District seat as a Republican but ran out of time raising money to pay the filing fee. He then started collecting signatures for an independent run but fell short of that number as well. When the Libertarians\u2019 Third District candidate, Nathan LaFrance, moved to another state, Gov. Asa Hutchinson allowed the party to nominate another candidate in his place.\n\nAt a special caucus in Fayetteville, Isaacson was questioned about his views to see if they matched the party\u2019s. They were close enough. He says he wants to \u201cget the government out of our pockets and out of our backyard.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some things in the Libertarians I do agree with, but like I told them, basically I\u2019m going to be myself,\u201d he said.\n\nLOOKING TO BE COMPETITIVE\n\nPakko is hardly expecting a Libertarian landslide this year, but he\u2019s hoping the party can be more competitive than in the past. In a number of races, the Libertarian is the only opponent facing a major party candidate. \u201cIn some cases, depending on the circumstances and the ability of our candidates to marshal some resources and mount effective campaigns, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s inconceivable that we might win a race here or there,\u201d he said.\n\nSo what then? What if the dog catches the car, and the party starts growing and winning elections? Both Gilbert and Pakko said that would create some challenges. Pakko said that the party has always been concerned that someone who\u2019s really not a Libertarian \u2013 a disaffected Republican or Democrat \u2013 would use the party as his or her own vehicle, or that outsiders would seize the party\u2019s reins. Even if those don\u2019t happen, success would require a lot of newcomers. \u201cWhen the time comes that the Libertarian Party is ready to break through and be competitive in the electoral process, it\u2019s going to feel to an awful lot of insiders that it\u2019s an outside takeover,\u201d he said.\n\nGilbert says that he has long been concerned about the party\u2019s purists, or \u201cthis percentage in the Libertarian Party who really don\u2019t want to get involved in electoral politics.\u201d After decades of working for the cause, he wants the party to be more than a club or debating society. He\u2019s ready to win, and then deal with the consequences.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the camp for, \u2018Wade out into it neck deep,\u2019\u201d he said, \u2018\u201cand see what happens.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local & Regional News", "description": "In the last two election cycles, one political party in Arkansas has fielded a full slate of candidates to challenge the Republicans for state and federal", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://ualrpublicradio.org/post/libertarians-rising-third-party-arkansas-trying-be-more-third-wheel", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kuar/files/styles/medium/public/201506/pakko.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "In the last two election cycles, one political party in Arkansas has fielded a full slate of candidates to challenge the Republicans for state and federal", "title": "Libertarians Rising: Third Party In Arkansas Trying To Be More Than A Third Wheel"}, "story_id": 477684866, "twitter": {"site": "@kuarpublicradio", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kuarpublicradio"}, "author": "Steve Brawner / Talk Business & Politics", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Libertarians Rising: Third Party In Arkansas Trying To Be More Than A Third Wheel"}, "nid": 58922, "datePublished": "2016-05-11", "keywords": "Arkansas Politics", "wordCount": 2350, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "He says members of the Tea Party traditionally have seen Libertarians as a distraction from their goal of changing the Republican Party from within.\nThe party counts about a hundred dues-paying members at the state level and perhaps another hundred or so who are registered Libertarians but not active in the state party.\n\u201cThat part of the Republican Party that believed that Asa Hutchinson was going to end the private option, those folks are talking,\u201d Gilbert said.\nIn 2012, the Libertarians\u2019 candidate, Gary Johnson, the former Republican governor of New Mexico, won only 1.5% of the vote in Arkansas.\nMembers of the Libertarian Party of Arkansas competed for all state constitutional offices and in all congressional races in 2014 and are on the ballot in all congressional races this year."}
