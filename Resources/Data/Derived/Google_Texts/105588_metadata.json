Mike Christian said he\u2019s formally requesting a legislative hearing on the state\u2019s death penalty procedures following the April 29 death of Clayton Lockett, whose vein collapsed prompting prison officials to halt his punishment and note the execution drugs weren\u2019t administered properly.\n\nLockett died of an apparent heart attack about 43 minutes after the execution began.\n\nSEE ALSO: Wyoming lawmakers mull firing squad for executions\n\nChristian, a former state highway patrolman from Oklahoma City, said he believes a firing squad would be the most logical second option after lethal injection.\n\n\u201cFiring squad, hanging and electric chair. I think those are the three that are definitely constitutional,\u201d said Christian, who earlier this year called for the impeachment of state Supreme Court justices who supported a temporary stay of execution for Lockett. \u201cI think just about anybody in Oklahoma would support some of these ideas we\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\nChristian has said previously he wouldn\u2019t care if condemned inmates in Oklahoma were beheaded or fed to lions.\n\nFive execution methods are currently legal in various places in the United States: injection, electrocution, gas, firing squad and hanging. Tennessee last month became the first state to allow use of the electric chair in some circumstances regardless of the inmate\u2019s wishes, if injection drugs are not available, but all of the 32 states that have the death penalty primarily use lethal injection.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of lethal injection in a 2008 Kentucky case in which the high court said there is no constitutional right to a painless execution.\n\nUnder Oklahoma law, if lethal injection is declared unconstitutional, the state would switch to electrocution. If both of those methods are determined unconstitutional, a firing squad is a third option.\n\nChristian said he intends to explore whether to change the law to make a firing squad the second option, and if inmates should be allowed to select the method. He said any law change likely wouldn\u2019t apply to the 50 Oklahoma inmates already sentenced to die by lethal injection.\n\nState Rep. Aaron Stiles, a Norman Republican and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he\u2019s interested in Christian\u2019s study. He has said in the past that he supports looking at alternative options for executions, including a firing squad.\n\nChristian plans to solicit testimony from experts in Utah, the last state to use a firing squad when it executed inmate Ronnie Lee Gardner in 2010. Five executioners armed with .30-caliber rifles stood about 25 feet from Gardner and fired at a white target pinned to his chest. One rifle was loaded with a blank so no one knows who fired the fatal shot.\n\n___\n\nFollow Sean Murphy at www.twitter.com/apseanmurphy .", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Republican lawmaker reacting to an Oklahoma inmate's botched lethal injection said Tuesday he wants to explore giving condemned prisoners the option of death by firing squad, hanging or the electric chair.", "Author": "Sean Murphy", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Republican lawmaker reacting to an Oklahoma inmate\u2019s botched lethal injection said Tuesday he wants to explore giving condemned prisoners the option of death by firing squad, hanging or the electric chair.", "title": "Okla. lawmaker to explore hanging, firing squad as execution options", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/10/oklahoma-gop-lawmaker-eyes-firing-squad-option/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/17/wolverine3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/05/17/wolverine3.jpg", "title": "Okla. lawmaker to explore hanging, firing squad as execution options", "description": "A Republican lawmaker reacting to an Oklahoma inmate's botched lethal injection said Tuesday he wants to explore giving condemned prisoners the option of death by firing squad, hanging or the electric", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Law Crime, Mike Christian, Clayton Lockett"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0a68\"", "article_summary": "Five execution methods are currently legal in various places in the United States: injection, electrocution, gas, firing squad and hanging.\nHe has said in the past that he supports looking at alternative options for executions, including a firing squad.\n\u201cFiring squad, hanging and electric chair.\nIf both of those methods are determined unconstitutional, a firing squad is a third option.\nSEE ALSO: Wyoming lawmakers mull firing squad for executionsChristian, a former state highway patrolman from Oklahoma City, said he believes a firing squad would be the most logical second option after lethal injection."}
