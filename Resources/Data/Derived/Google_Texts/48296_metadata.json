But as a dress rehearsal, ice-breaker that also had the feel of someone standing at a microphone going, \u201cTesting 1, 2, 3 \u2026testing,\u201d this worked for the Rams.\n\nBobo\u2019s push-the-pace, no-huddle offense approach met with little resistance from the Tigers, and the rookie head coach \u2014 the former Georgia quarterback and long-time Bulldogs assistant \u2014 experienced in a relatively low-ley atmosphere his first try at both calling the plays and being the man on the sideline with final authority on everything.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a good day today,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cThe guys did what I wanted them to do, which was stay focused for 60 mnutes. They had a good look in their eyes last night and this morning, it was the same thing. We came out here and started fast.\u201d\n\nIn his first career start, sophomore Nick Stevens was 20-of-28 for 289 yards and five touchdowns, playing through the first series of the second half and helping the Rams to a 51-7 lead.\n\n\u201cThis was a huge momentum booster,\u201d said CSU All-American receiver Rashard Higgins, who had seven catches for 84 yards, including a 12-yarder for a touchdown. \u201cJust going into this game, we never looked down to our opponent and we wanted to come out with a bang.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t too easy. It was a challenge. We got to hit somebody else besides our teammates and it was fun. This game is fun, and you have to have fun when you\u2019re playing it.\u201d\n\nWideout Joe Hansley had five receptions for 67 yards and one TD.\n\n\u201cI think if anything that gave us a chance to kind of see where we\u2019re at as a team,\u201d Hansley said. \u201cIt gave us a chance to see what we need to work on. I think we saw the speed and tempo we can play at in an actual game.\u201d\n\nStevens, a sophomore from Murrieta, Calif., had thrown only 25 passes as Garrett Grayson\u2019s backup last season.\n\n\u201cIt was good that we were able to come out so fast on offense and the defense played so well,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cIt\u2019s good that coach Bobo got to see us making plays on offense and making stops on defense.\u201d\n\nThe tone was set early, when Savannah State had bad snaps on its first two plays and CSU linebacker Kevin Davis fell on the ball after the second in the end zone for a touchdown only 47 seconds into the game.\n\nThe Rams led 24-0 after the first quarter and 45-7 at the half.\n\nStevens\u2019 touchdown passes were to five different receivers \u2014 Kivon Cartwright, Higgins, Xavier Williams, Jasen Oden Jr. and Hansley (12). Backup Coleman Key threw a 13-yard TD pass to Olabisi Johnson as the Rams took a 58-7 lead with 2:37 left in the third quarter.\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei\n\nCSU coaching debuts\n\nMike Bobo had a successful first game Saturday as the Rams\u2019 head coach with a 65-13 victory over Savannah State.
