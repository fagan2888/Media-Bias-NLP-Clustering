Sen. Lindsey Graham ripped former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee Wednesday over claims that the GOP-led Senate has done “nothing” on a multitude of issues, saying he doesn’t know “what he’s talking about.”

Appearing on “The Hugh Hewitt Show,” Graham took the former governor to task after Huckabee wondered why he went out to campaign nationwide for Senate candidates last year in an attempt to get the majority.

In his comments, Huckabee blasted the GOP-controlled Senate, saying that rather than stopping President Barack Obama’s “executive overreach” on various issues, including Obamacare, the chamber has done “nothing.” The former Fox News host added that “I’m not sure I did that last year.”

The South Carolina senator told Hewitt that Huckabee needed a “civics” lesson, adding flatly that “you’re not going to repeal Obamacare with Obama sitting in office.”

“I don’t think he knows what he’s talking about,” Graham said. “We have voted umpteen times to repeal Obamacare. At the end of the day, you’re not going to repeal Obamacare as long as he’s president.”

“Having a Republican majority means a lot. I think we’re doing things in the Senate today we would never have gotten to do otherwise. We sent the Keystone Pipeline to his desk. He vetoed it. We’ve stopped their agenda in their tracks,” Graham continued. “You’ve got to get 60 votes to do the big things. You’ve got a Democratic president you’ve got to deal with. I think it would be insane for us to repeal the filibuster, which has been a check and balance to bad ideas for a very, very long time.”

“And at the end of the day, here’s civics. Mike, you’re not going to repeal Obamacare with Obama sitting in office,” Graham said. “The only way you’re going to repeal Obamacare is to get a Republican elected. You’re not going to get a Republican elected to the presidency that doesn’t believe you’ve got to reform entitlements.”
