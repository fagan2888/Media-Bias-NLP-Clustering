This ballot issue does not deal with the portion of the utility occupation tax that pays for research and legal costs associated with municipalization. This tax generates about $4.3 million a year for the general fund, which pays for basic services such as police, fire, parks and libraries.\n\nWhat supporters say: This tax replaces the franchise fee that Xcel Energy used to pay and pays for basic services the entire community needs. If it is not extended, the city might have to cut important functions. This tax is completely separate from municipalization, and voters should extend it regardless of their feelings on a city-run energy utility.\n\nWhat opponents say: There is no organized opposition to this measure. Some people have suggested the city might be forced to renegotiate a franchise with Xcel if the tax is defeated.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28948178/boulder-question-2o-utility-occupation-tax-extension", "sailthru.author": "Camera staff", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28948178:view"}, "startDate": "2015-10-10T18:17:58-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "What it asks: \"Without raising additional taxes, shall that portion of the city's utility occupation tax on public utility companies that deliver electricity and natural gas to customers in the city that replaced the franchise fee paid by Public Service Company and supports general revenue needs of the city be extended from its current expiration date of December 31, 2017 and expire on December 31, 2022 with the revenues of the existing tax as extended being used to continue to support local", "title": "Boulder Question 2O: Utility occupation tax extension", "url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28948178/boulder-question-2o-utility-occupation-tax-extension", "image": "http://local.dailycamera.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/1200x627/dailycamera.png", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-10-10T18:18:03-0600", "endDate": "2025-10-09T18:29:15-0600", "news_keywords": "boulder,colorado,boulder county,louisville,lafayette,superior,longmont,candidates,city council,ballot,ballot issues", "byline": "Camera staff", "pubDate": "2015-10-10T18:19:09-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-10T18:17:58-0600", "sailthru.title": "Boulder Question 2O: Utility occupation tax extension", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.section": "Election", "description": "What it asks: \"Without raising additional taxes, shall that portion of the city's utility occupation tax on public utility companies that deliver electricity and natural gas to customers in the city that replaced the franchise fee paid by Public Service Company and supports general revenue needs of the city be extended from its current expiration date of December 31, 2017 and expire on December 31, 2022 with the revenues of the existing tax as extended being used to continue to support local", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/local-election-news/ci_28948178/boulder-question-2o-utility-occupation-tax-extension", "image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "What it asks: \"Without raising additional taxes, shall that portion of the city's utility occupation tax on public utility companies that deliver electricity and natural gas to customers in the city that replaced the franchise fee paid by Public Service Company and supports general revenue needs of the city be extended from its current expiration date of December 31, 2017 and expire on December 31, 2022 with the revenues of the existing tax as extended being used to continue to support local", "title": "Boulder Question 2O: Utility occupation tax extension"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674"}, "article_summary": "This ballot issue does not deal with the portion of the utility occupation tax that pays for research and legal costs associated with municipalization.\nSome people have suggested the city might be forced to renegotiate a franchise with Xcel if the tax is defeated.\nThis tax is completely separate from municipalization, and voters should extend it regardless of their feelings on a city-run energy utility.\nWhat it means: Should the portion of the utility occupation tax on Xcel Energy bills that replaces the city's franchise fee and goes into the general fund be extended through the end of 2022?\nWhat supporters say: This tax replaces the franchise fee that Xcel Energy used to pay and pays for basic services the entire community needs."}
