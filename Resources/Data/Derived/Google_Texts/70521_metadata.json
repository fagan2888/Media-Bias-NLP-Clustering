Perhaps even a category like health care? Maybe.\n\nIn fact, as previously reported by Drug Store News back in 2011, Duane Reade partnered with the Tensator Group Co., to employ at 40 Wall St. the industry\u2019s first Virtual Assistant. Using holographic imaging and audio-visual technology, the Virtual Assistant created the illusion of a real person who greets customers when they enter the store, providing guidance on everything store related, including making suggestions and recommendations on products available to shoppers.\n\n\n\nAt TY KU, it worked with Tensator\u2019s Customer Journey experts to identify the exact persona they wanted and developed the script they had in mind for a virtual sommelier. TY KU\u2019s Virtual Sommelier was designed to provide an array of information about TY KU Sake, covering everything a customer would want and need to know about TY KU Sake \u2014 from how the sake is prepared, how best to enjoy various different kinds of TY KU Sake and even recommendations on which food pairings are best with which sake, along with the right temperatures to serve them. The Tensator Virtual Sommelier also included messages for health conscious shoppers to let them know that TY KU Sake is all natural, gluten free, sulfite free and has very low acidity \u2014 making it the perfect complement to seafood, sushi and lighter, health-conscious cuisine.\n\nBefore deploying the Tensator Virtual Sommelier, TY KU Sake sales were flat for six straight weeks. After the first week, TY KU saw a 500% increase in sales, followed by a second week of 600% lift.\n\n\u201cThere is literally no other form of signage that could have achieved the amazing boost in sales that the Tensator Virtual Assistant delivered,\u201d said Adrian Molina, brand communications manager, TY KU. \u201cIts ability to captivate shoppers is unparalleled. Not only did shoppers stop, look and listen \u2014 they bought TY KU Sake \u2014 providing us with an amazing 600% lift in sales in the first weeks of deployment. We are delighted with the results of our Virtual Sommelier.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_thumbnail_image/09-2014/Tensator-0.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Antoinette Alexander", "og": {"image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_medium_image/09-2014/Tensator-0.jpg", "height": 200}, "type": "article", "title": "Tensator's Virtual Assistant helps boost sales 600%"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tensator, a provider of queue management and customer journey solutions, has announced that TY KU, a sake and spirits company, realized a 600% uplift in sales following the deployment of Tensator\u2019s Virtual Assistant signage at a national retail chain in Monterey, Calif.", "title": "Tensator's Virtual Assistant helps boost sales 600%", "url": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/article/tensators-virtual-assistant-helps-boost-sales-600", "image": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_main_image/2014-09/Tensator_0.jpg", "site": "@drugstorenews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-09-25 01:01:00", "sailthru.title": "Tensator's Virtual Assistant helps boost sales 600%", "google-site-verification": "qD-DLdnS9RBbjYJ-MITi4cSvUByohsoX4WClEJJuv7I", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.drugstorenews.com/sites/drugstorenews.com/files/field_main_image/2014-09/Tensator_0.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdadee\"", "article_summary": "Before deploying the Tensator Virtual Sommelier, TY KU Sake sales were flat for six straight weeks.\nAfter the first week, TY KU saw a 500% increase in sales, followed by a second week of 600% lift.\nNot only did shoppers stop, look and listen \u2014 they bought TY KU Sake \u2014 providing us with an amazing 600% lift in sales in the first weeks of deployment.\n\u201cThere is literally no other form of signage that could have achieved the amazing boost in sales that the Tensator Virtual Assistant delivered,\u201d said Adrian Molina, brand communications manager, TY KU.\nWe are delighted with the results of our Virtual Sommelier.\u201d"}
