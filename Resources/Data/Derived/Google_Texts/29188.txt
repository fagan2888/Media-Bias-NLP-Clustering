Deadwood, SD

Snapping selfies in front of Deadwood Monument markers is about to become less of a gamble.



The Deadwood City Commission recently granted funding to renovate the areas surrounding the six monuments in the city. The monuments are in heavy traffic areas and pulling over to take a quick selfie isn't the safest.



Officials say the forthcoming project will make it safer for drivers to pull off the highway and memorialize their trip to Deadwood. They also plan to install interpretive signs that will describe the significance of the monument markers and possibly encourage them to download a "Deadwood App" that will teach them about the historic town.



Officials say for now they're not sure how much the project will cost.
