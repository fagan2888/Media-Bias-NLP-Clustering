Every man but one a subordinate clerk in a bureau.\u201d\u2014Ludwig von Mises, Bureaucracy (1944)\n\nContinue Reading Below\n\nThe end run around Congress\u2019s power to legislate is gapping wider.\n\nIt includes presidential and federal authority exercised not just through executive orders, but a circus mirror of rules, guidance documents, memoranda, bulletins, manuals, circulars, public notices and other agency proclamations.\n\nAnd that doesn\u2019t include a tax code simplified beyond all comprehension.\n\nThe open fire hydrant of rulemaking is occurring outside the U.S. Congress by the White House and federal agencies. Many rules are not being reviewed by the Congress or the public.\n\nAmerican taxpayers are supposed to be governed by laws passed by Congress and signed into law by the President in this representative democracy. But leviathan has taken over, there is no downside for overzealous bureaucrats who now hallucinate rules into being and then whoop them past Congress into the U.S. economy, exerting a gravitational pull on growth.\n\nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe rules hit all levels of American life, health care, retirement, the workplace, education, and the Internet, says Clyde Crews, Jr., a top researcher and respected author with the libertarian-leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute, in his new report, \u201cMapping Washington\u2019s Lawlessness 2016.\u201d\n\nAccording to Crews\u2019 estimation of the \u201cregulatory dark matter,\u201d the federal government has published 524,251 \u201cpublic notices\u201d describing federal rules that affect the economy in the Federal Register since 1994. Federal agencies issued 3,554 rules and regulations in 2014, versus the 224 bills Congress passed and the president signed into law last year. \u201cThe average has been 26 rules for every law over the past decade,\u201d Crews says.\n\nThe consequence of the vegetative universe is complete lack of accountability to the American taxpayer. Crews says the federal government now gets away with issuing misleading unemployment and GDP statistics, often \u201cto justify increased government spending.\u201d\n\nFederal agencies routinely deny Freedom of Information Act requests (throw a dart at any of them); federal workers use private email for official business (i.e. former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton); and routinely \u201close\u201d government emails (i.e. the IRS). \u201cWashington\u2019s attitude toward the public is to conceal rather than disclose,\u201d Crews says.\n\nNeither the federal government nor the American taxpayer has any clear idea of the economic cost of this barrage. The cost of federal regulation was estimated to hit $1.88 trillion last year, bigger than the gross domestic product of South Korea, Crews has estimated, but no one knows for sure.\n\nConsider this. In a 2015 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) noted: \u201cThe Federal Register Indicates there are over 430 departments, agencies, and sub-agencies in the federal government.\u201d\n\nThe Senator apparently was citing the Federal Register Agency List, which depicts 438 federal agencies. That\u2019s a lot of rulemaking entities.\n\nBut note that the Senator used the word \u201cindicates.\u201d That means no one in government knows for sure how many rulemaking agencies and units there really are in the federal government.\n\n\u201cIf nobody knows how many agencies exist by whose decrees we must abide, that means we do not know how many people work for the government (let alone contractors making a living from taxpayers) nor how many rules there really are,\u201d Crews says.\n\nOn top of that, the White House has refused to enforce laws passed by Congress, Crews notes.\n\nThat includes \u201cthe July 2013 Treasury Department\u2019s unilateral delay, first by blog post, then by IRS guidance, of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s (ACA) employer mandate and its accompanying tax penalty for non-compliance,\u201d Crews says. \u201cThen came the November 2013 declaration\u2014first by the president during a news conference and subsequently in Department of Health and Human Services guidance material\u2014that insurers could continue to sell non-ACA compliant health policies.\u201d\n\nBlame Congress for not pushing back harder and the executive branch for exacerbating the problem. \u201cCongress rarely uses its most powerful accountability tool, the Congressional Review Act, to pass resolutions of disapproval (RODs) of costly or controversial agency rules,\u201d Crews says.\n\nIn contrast, Canada and Great Britain have both cut back on the federal vegetative universe by enacting \u201crule-in, rule-out\u201d requirements with some success, Crews adds.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan tried to rein in regulatory excess by centralizing a review process at the Office of Management and Budget to make sure the costs of federal rules don\u2019t exceed the benefits.\n\nBut President Bill Clinton undid that move with, what else, an executive order in 1993, soon after he was elected, dialing back OMB oversight in order to \u201creaffirm the primacy of federal agencies in the regulatory decision-making process.\u201d\n\nWorth noting here is that the executive order record holder is Franklin Delano Roosevelt with 3,467 executive orders. President Barack Obama had issued a total of 236 executive orders as of October 16, 2015. There were 777 presidential executive orders published from 1995 up until that date.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS/Government Spending,/FOX BUSINESS/INDUSTRIES/Health Care,/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS/Congress,/FOX BUSINESS/COLUMNS/Emac's Bottom Line,/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS/White House,/FOX BUSINESS/GOVERNMENT AND INSTITUTIONS", "dcterms.modified": "2016-01-04 09:51:14 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "The end run around Congress\u2019s power to legislate is gapping wider.
