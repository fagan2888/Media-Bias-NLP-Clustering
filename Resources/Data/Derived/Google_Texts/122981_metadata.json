Katherine Branch, the White House advisor\u2019s assistant, replied less than 30 minutes later to ask if he was available to talk to Jarrett later that afternoon.\n\nBurrell and Jarrett apparently had that little chat. He followed up the next day with a summary of the issue he talked with her about. The document attached in the email expressed concern over the budget neutrality of Obamacare\u2019s \u201crisk corridor\u201d program, known to many as the insurer \u201cbailout.\u201d\n\nThe risk corridor program guarantees payments from the from the federal government to insurers if the risk pool isn\u2019t properly balanced with the young and healthy people who are intended to offset the costs of sick and unhealthy consumers. The payments come from a fund into which insurers contribute, and it was originally scored as budget-neutral, meaning that there wouldn\u2019t be any cost to taxpayers.\n\nGiven the unlikelihood of many insurers contributing to the program due to unbalanced risk pools, Burrell suggested that insurance premiums would rise, and spark a negative public reaction, unless the administration was willing to \u201cclarify\u201d (read: provide more funding) the bailout rule.\n\nJarrett responded later in the day on April 5, telling Burrell that \u201cthe policy team is aggressively exploring options\u201d to ease insurers\u2019 concerns. After nearly a week, on April 11, Jarrett told Burrell that a bulletin had been issued. He replied that the White House \u201chas to be prepared for large premium rate increases in many parts of the country because a key stabilizer (risk corridors) can now not be counted on.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration, in May, expanded the Obamacare bailout, outside of its original budget-neutral projection. Though the Congressional Budget Office projected in February that this provision would generate revenue, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, in a report released yesterday, estimated that the risk corridor program will cost taxpayers more than $725 million this year.\n\nThe Committee also found that 12 of the 15 traditional insurance companies it surveyed expect to receive money from the bailout program this year, while just one expects to make payments. Two insurers, the report says, don\u2019t expect to make payments to or receive anything from the program. Several insurance co-ops expect payments from the program as well, though most don\u2019t expect to make or receive payments.\n\nCoupled with Obamacare\u2019s risk adjustment program, which transfers money from plans with more balanced risk pools to those with unbalanced polls, the bailout to health insurance companies is going to come very close to $1 billion.\n\nDespite the populist arguments made by President Barack Obama and Democrats, Obamacare is proof that corporate welfare and the culture of cronyism is alive and well in this administration.
