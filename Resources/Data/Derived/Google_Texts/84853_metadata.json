Take good care of our vets who have served this country,\u201d she told the crowd.\n\nThe presidential hopeful also called Trump a loose cannon on defense while saying his tax plan was written by a billionaire for billionaires.\n\n\u201cHe has written a tax plan that I say is a tax plan written by a billionaires for billionaires. That is exactly what it is,\u201d Clinton said.\n\n\u201cHe has said he is going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, get rid of it, but he won\u2019t tell you what he will replace it with because, you know what, you don\u2019t want to hear what he wants to replace it with,\u201d she contined. \u201cAnd he has all this loose-cannon kind of talk about foreign policy and national security.\u201d\n\nThen she talked about being bipartisan.\n\n\u201cIf someone has a better idea, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Republican idea, Independent idea or Democratic idea, I don\u2019t care where it comes from , if it\u2019s a good idea, then by definition it\u2019s an American idea,\u201d she explained.\n\nMrs. Clinton barely mentioned her Democratic Party challenger Bernie Sanders.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hillary Clinton made a stop in Hopkinsville ahead of Tuesday night\u2019s primary in Kentucky.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=523213092", "og": {"site_name": "WKRN.com", "description": "Hillary Clinton made a stop in Hopkinsville ahead of Tuesday night\u2019s primary in Kentucky.", "title": "Clinton woos Kentucky voters the day before their primary", "url": "http://wkrn.com/2016/05/16/clinton-woos-kentucky-voters-the-day-before-their-primary/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://mgtvwkrn.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/8e4d31e7a1a14eb2b1edefe1a567425e.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hillary Clinton made a stop in Hopkinsville ahead of Tuesday night\u2019s primary in Kentucky.", "title": "Clinton woos Kentucky voters the day before their primary", "image": {"src": "https://mgtvwkrn.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/8e4d31e7a1a14eb2b1edefe1a567425e.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WKRN", "site": "wkrn", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Nashville's News 2", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.mediageneral.wkrn", "fb": {"pages": 121386074555790}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wkrn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/90919f996ff323fc31b4cb1f4b7e825e?s=16", "application-name": "WKRN.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wkrntv", "published_time": "2016-05-16T07:47:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-16T22:31:01+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "G2WXEm6QW1PkffhJXpGnD-Yn9z2aSfnZHNVXc1bnnRo", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe has written a tax plan that I say is a tax plan written by a billionaires for billionaires.\nTake good care of our vets who have served this country,\u201d she told the crowd.\n\u201cIf someone has a better idea, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Republican idea, Independent idea or Democratic idea, I don\u2019t care where it comes from , if it\u2019s a good idea, then by definition it\u2019s an American idea,\u201d she explained.\n\u201cWe need a commander in chief that will also take care of everybody at Fort Campbell, take good care of the men and women in uniform.\nShe was in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, for a rally ahead of the state\u2019s democratic primary on Tuesday."}
