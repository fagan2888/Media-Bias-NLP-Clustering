Only 2% of Americans do not eat any animal products. (This number has not changed appreciably for 20 years). Further, the fact that five out of six vegetarians go back to eating meat suggests that an all-veggie diet is very hard for most people to maintain over the long haul.\"\n\n\n\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) currently includes meat as part of a balanced diet, but also states that a vegetarian diet can meet \"the recommended dietary allowances for nutrients.\"\n\n\n\nAmericans eat an average of 52.3 pounds of beef, 57.4 pounds of chicken, and 43.5 pounds of pork, per person annually, according to 2012 estimates from the USDA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources:\n\n\n\nKathryn Asher, Che Green, Hans Gutbrod, Mirna Jewell, Galina Hale, and Brock Bastian, \"Study of Current and Former Vegetarians and Vegans,\" humaneresearch.org, Dec. 2014\n\n\n\nEarth Policy Institute, \"Peak Meat: US Meat Consumption Falling,\" earth-policy.org, Mar. 7, 2012\n\n\n\nHal Herzog, \"84% of Vegetarians and Vegans Return to Meat.
