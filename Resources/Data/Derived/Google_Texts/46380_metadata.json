Outraged over Benghazi, the allegations that the IRS targeted conservative groups, the NSA, and especially Obamacare, ralliers agreed: Obama must go. \u201cI know a scoundrel when I see one,\u201d said former US congressman Bob Barr, who helped lead the impeachment effort against Bill Clinton in 1998. \u201cWe have a scoundrel living in that house right here and we need to get him out.\u201d\n\nBarr, who will run for Congress in Georgia in 2014, also read a revised version of his 1997 inquiry of impeachment with President Obama\u2019s infractions replacing former President Clinton\u2019s. He later told TIME that the purpose of the event was to remind American people that they have the power to stand up to government.\n\nKlayman described the rally as the first day of the second American Revolution. At the event, a George Washington impersonator presented the grievances of the coalition in the form of a repurposed Declaration of Independence. The demands included seeing President Obama\u2019s birth certificate, not George Washington said, the \u201cphotocopied version,\u201d repealing the Affordable Care Act, and allowing witnesses from Benghazi to give their accounts. Klayman said that if President Obama does not adhere to their demands by Black Friday, Nov. 29, the day that traditionally marks the beginning of the Christmas shopping season, the protestors would have no choice but to attempt to force him out of office.\n\nThere were no announcements aboutthe person best fit to replace Obama. When asked who he would rather see in his place, Larry Sherwood from Virginia who held a sign that read \u201cObama Lies\u201d said he hadn\u2019t yet considered it. \u201cMaybe Rand Paul,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he\u2019s getting kind of old\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Less than 100 Tea Party-affiliated protesters gathered in Lafayette Square on Tuesday to call for Obama\u2019s impeachment, just steps from the White House where President Obama was meeting \u00a0with members of the Senate Foreign Relations committee.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://swampland.time.com/2013/11/19/tea-party-protestors-demand-obama-impeachment-outside-white-house/", "type": "article", "image": "https://timeswampland.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/ppotw_0909_04.jpg?w=611", "site_name": "TIME.com", "title": "Tea Party Protestors Demand Obama Impeachment Outside White House | TIME.com"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Political insight from the Beltway and beyond", "fb": {"admins": "1124331582,512158401,808970553,100000018008769", "app_id": 53177223193}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://swampland.time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/11d9978cfec7d5a71822113fdc067df5?s=16", "application-name": "Swampland", "keywords": "tea party, accuracy in media, bob bar, gun owners of america, larry klayman, tea party, tea party patriots", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "tea party, accuracy in media, bob bar, gun owners of america, larry klayman, tea party, tea party patriots"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb937\"", "article_summary": "Less than 100 Tea Party-affiliated protesters gathered in Lafayette Square on Tuesday to call for Obama\u2019s impeachment, just steps from the White House where President Obama was meeting with members of the Senate Foreign Relations committee.\nOutraged over Benghazi, the allegations that the IRS targeted conservative groups, the NSA, and especially Obamacare, ralliers agreed: Obama must go.\nThe demands included seeing President Obama\u2019s birth certificate, not George Washington said, the \u201cphotocopied version,\u201d repealing the Affordable Care Act, and allowing witnesses from Benghazi to give their accounts.\nKlayman said that if President Obama does not adhere to their demands by Black Friday, Nov. 29, the day that traditionally marks the beginning of the Christmas shopping season, the protestors would have no choice but to attempt to force him out of office.\nJustin Sullivan / Getty Images A homemade bumper sticker is displayed on the back of a car during a Tea Party rally on Sept. 4, 2011, in Concord, New Hampshire."}
