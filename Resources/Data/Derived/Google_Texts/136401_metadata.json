Why did you write this one?\n\nAfter teaching constitutional law for decades, I realized that our debates about it are missing something really important\u2014that there are certain personality types whom we are intuitively drawn toward. I\u2019d been focused on the more standard debates\u2014should you follow the original intent? Should the court protect minorities? That set of arguments, while important, misses the immediate psychological affinities people have for certain types in the legal and political arenas.\n\nWhat are those types?\n\nHeroes are comfortable with big, bold strokes, such as striking down the Affordable Care Act, and soldiers defer to decisions by the political branches, such as Congress passing the Affordable Care Act. Many people are drawn to minimalists, who speak softly and carry a small stick; cautious people who say it\u2019s not time for drama, it\u2019s time to make a marginal difference. And then there are mutes, who just believe that silence is best when it comes to difficult legal questions.\n\nSo we\u2019ve had successful minimalist or mute politicians?\n\nMany of our most celebrated political figures were heroes, who had bold visions: Lincoln, F.D.R. But some prominent presidents, such as Clinton, were impressively minimalist. He wasn\u2019t passing huge legislation or fundamentally changing the country, but was making incremental improvements. And some people are drawn, even in campaigns, to someone whom they believe will be a stable, steady hand.\n\nWhat role should humility play in all of this?\n\nHumility is of central importance; I think it\u2019s an underappreciated virtue in the contemporary discussion of law and politics. Humility is a recognition that, however much time we spend on a topic, we probably know a lot less than there is to be known, and a lot less than we think we do; so for judges to be cautious about dealing with an environmental question, or immigration, or the Internet, makes a lot of sense, because they have a limited stock of knowledge. I think that\u2019s very important, so if I have to choose among the four personae, I choose the minimalist. It\u2019s good to come up with approaches that are not going to create terrible trouble if we turn out to be wrong. There are lots of ways of approaching governing that guard against your own capacity for error.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Law professor Cass Sunstein, the author of \u201cBlink,\u201d explores the four distinct personality types of U.S. Supreme Court justices in \u201cConstitutional Personae.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "PublishersWeekly.com", "image": "http://www.publishersweekly.com/images/data/ARTICLE_PHOTO/photo/000/035/35518-1.JPG", "type": "article", "description": "Law professor Cass Sunstein, the author of \u201cBlink,\u201d explores the four distinct personality types of U.S. Supreme Court justices in \u201cConstitutional Personae.\u201d", "title": "Hero, Soldier, Minimalist, Mute: PW Talks with Cass Sunstein"}, "twitter": {"site": "@publisherswkly", "image": "http://www.publishersweekly.com/images/data/ARTICLE_PHOTO/photo/000/035/35518-1.JPG", "description": "Law professor Cass Sunstein, the author of \u201cBlink,\u201d explores the four distinct personality types of U.S. Supreme Court justices in \u201cConstitutional Personae.\u201d", "card": "summary", "title": "Hero, Soldier, Minimalist, Mute: PW Talks with Cass Sunstein"}, "fb": {"admins": 623101154, "app_id": 190910504285954}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "keywords": "author interviews, authors, author profiles, author quotes, stephen king, stephanie meyer, michael crichton, jk rowling, obituaries, famous authors, new authors, publishers weekly,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "I think that\u2019s very important, so if I have to choose among the four personae, I choose the minimalist.\nSo we\u2019ve had successful minimalist or mute politicians?\nThat set of arguments, while important, misses the immediate psychological affinities people have for certain types in the legal and political arenas.\nHumility is of central importance; I think it\u2019s an underappreciated virtue in the contemporary discussion of law and politics.\nIt\u2019s good to come up with approaches that are not going to create terrible trouble if we turn out to be wrong."}
