The threatening float consisted of an outhouse labeled \u201cObama Presidential Library\u201d. Omaha.com reports The U.S. Department of Justice has joined the discussions over a controversial float in the Norfolk Independence Day parade. The department sent a member of its Community Relations Service team, which gets involved in discrimination disputes, to a Thursday meeting about the issue. There are only a finite number of resources at Eric Holder\u2019s Department of Justice, so there's no time or manpower available to look into trivial matters such as NSA spying on Americans, IRS targeting political enemies, or the Veterans Administration allegedly killing thousands of vets and covering it up.\n\nWhat kind of paranoid, insecure presidential administration reacts to an insult to their honor with a federal investigation, particularly when there are so many urgent critical threats to Americans that they have refused to investigate?
