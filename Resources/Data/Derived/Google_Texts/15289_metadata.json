The site contains a wealth of information and advice on healthy pregnancies. But we don\u2019t have to assume that Blue Cross is promoting neonatal care out of any sense of public service. Healthy pregnancies are cheaper for insurance companies. An insured baby, with proper neonatal care, is less likely to have expensive health problems going forward.\n\nThe importance of prenatal care is underscored by the health risks associated with not having such care.\n\n\u201cWomen in the United States who do not receive prenatal care have an increased risk of experiencing a neonatal death\u2026 Lack of prenatal care is associated with a 40 percent increase in the risk of neonatal death overall\u2026\u201d says the Guttmacher Institute, citing a study, \u201cBlack women are more than three times as likely as white women not to receive prenatal care, and regardless of their prenatal care status, their infants are significantly more likely to die within their first 27 days of life than are infants born to white women.\u201d\n\nOther risks from not receiving adequate prenatal care include low birth weight for the infant, and pre-eclampsia, a form of organ damage, that affects the mother. From a human perspective, this is terrible and unnecessary. From the perspective of an insurance company, such health problems are expensive.\n\nYet, said Donohue, speaking for Blue Cross at the Rhode Island State House, \u201cThe only way insurance works is if you purchase it when you don\u2019t need it so it\u2019s there for you when you do. If you allow people a special enrollment period, whether they\u2019re diabetics, cancer patients or pregnant people, they won\u2019t buy it until they need it.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA or Obamacare) mandates that Rhode Islanders buy private insurance on the state run health insurance exchange, HealthSourceRI. \u201cIf you\u2019ve missed the open enrollment period,\u201d said Donohue, \u201c you\u2019ve broken the law and now you are penalized for that, and the penalties start to grow.\u201d\n\nDonahue is talking about financial penalties of course, but the real penalties from a societal point of view are dead babies, or babies and mothers with terrible health outcomes. Suddenly the financial penalty for not complying with the ACA mandate seems rather small and meaningless, doesn\u2019t it? But more to the point, it\u2019s exactly these negative health outcomes that Obamacare was supposed to address.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t let people buy insurance on their way to the hospital in an ambulance,\u201d said Donahue. I would say that having to worry about financial issues during a medical emergency is a major system failure, and further, these gaps in care for vulnerable Americans expose the weaknesses in today\u2019s for-profit health insurance industry, of which Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island is a big part.\n\nAccording to Physicians for a National Health Program (PNHP), \u201cSingle-payer national health insurance, also known as \u2018Medicare for all,\u2019 is a system in which a single public or quasi-public agency organizes health care financing, but the delivery of care remains largely in private hands. Under a single-payer system, all residents of the U.S. would be covered for all medically necessary services, including doctor, hospital, preventive, long-term care, mental health, reproductive health care, dental, vision, prescription drug and medical supply costs.\n\n\u201cThe program would be funded by the savings obtained from replacing today\u2019s inefficient, profit-oriented, multiple insurance payers with a single streamlined, nonprofit, public payer, and by modest new taxes based on ability to pay. Premiums would disappear; 95 percent of all households would save money. Patients would no longer face financial barriers to care such as co-pays and deductibles, and would regain free choice of doctor and hospital. Doctors would regain autonomy over patient care.\u201d\n\nOn the national scene Bernie Sanders has championed single payer, calling it Medicare for All. \u201cHealth care must be recognized as a right, not a privilege,\u201d says Sanders, \u201cEvery man, woman and child in our country should be able to access the health care they need regardless of their income. The only long-term solution to America\u2019s health care crisis is a single-payer national health care program.\u201d\n\nState Representative Aaron Regunberg has introduced, for the second time, a bill to bring the benefits of a single payer health insurance program to Rhode Island. His bill would \u201cact would repeal the \u2018Rhode Island Health Care Reform Act of 2004 \u2013 Health Insurance Oversight\u2019 as well as the \u2018Rhode Island Health Benefit Exchange,\u2019 and would establish the Rhode Island comprehensive health insurance program.\u201d\n\nHis bill deserves our support.\n\nVN:R_U [1.9.20_1166]\n\nRating: 10.0/10 (2 votes cast)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.0", "copyright": "Copyright (c) February 2016", "author": "Steve Ahlquist", "revised": "Sunday, February 28th, 2016, 12:47 pm", "robots": "index,follow", "template": "Hybrid News 0.4", "keywords": "Civil Rights / Liberties, Class Warfare, corporate greed, Featured, Health Care, National News, News, reproductive freedom, Rhode Island, State House, Video, Women, Youth, aaron regunberg, aca, Affordable Care Act, Bernie Sanders, Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, Guttmacher Institute, healthsourceRI, Medicare for All, obamacare, Physicians for a National Health Program, PNHP, Shawn Donahue, single payer", "description": "In speaking out against a bill that would make sure no pregnant person could be denied medical coverage due to their pregnancy, a health insurance lawyer made one of the best cases possible for a national, single payer health program."}, "article_summary": "His bill would \u201cact would repeal the \u2018Rhode Island Health Care Reform Act of 2004 \u2013 Health Insurance Oversight\u2019 as well as the \u2018Rhode Island Health Benefit Exchange,\u2019 and would establish the Rhode Island comprehensive health insurance program.\u201dHis bill deserves our support.\n\u201cHealth care must be recognized as a right, not a privilege,\u201d says Sanders, \u201cEvery man, woman and child in our country should be able to access the health care they need regardless of their income.\nIn speaking out against a bill that would make sure no pregnant person could be denied medical coverage due to their pregnancy, a health insurance lawyer unintentionally made a great case for a national, single payer health program.\nThe only long-term solution to America\u2019s health care crisis is a single-payer national health care program.\u201dState Representative Aaron Regunberg has introduced, for the second time, a bill to bring the benefits of a single payer health insurance program to Rhode Island.\n\u201cNo one believes in the importance of pre-natal care more than Blue Cross,\u201d said Donohue, \u201cWe\u2019ve invested in it.\u201dThat\u2019s true."}
