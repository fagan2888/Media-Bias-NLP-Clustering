This year, it's $3,350 for an individual and $6,650 for a family, according to the U.S. Department of Treasury.\n\nWhen high-deductible, account-based health plans were first introduced, premiums were much lower than what employers paid for traditional HMO and PPO coverage, McPhearson explained. Businesses were able to plunk the premium savings into employees' health savings accounts.\n\nToday, these high-deductible plans are typically cheaper than HMOs and PPOs, but the gap in premium \"is less than it was six or eight years ago,\" McPhearson said. That's partly due to year-over-year increases in health care spending, which drives up health plan premiums, he said.\n\nThe decline in employer HSA contributions may also reflect financial pressures posed by the Affordable Care Act, UBA noted.\n\nUBA's survey is based on responses from almost 10,000 employers that sponsor nearly 17,000 health plans nationwide.\n\nEmployer HSA contributions vary by region, industry and size, according to the survey.\n\nBusinesses with 50 or fewer employees tend to be more generous than larger employers with 1,000 or more workers. Small companies' HSA contribution to workers with family coverage tends to exceed $890 average, while larger firms kick in an average of $760, the survey found.\n\nSmall employers' generosity helps compensate for deductibles that are generally higher than those paid by workers in large group plans, said UBA partner Andrea Kinkade in a news release. Kinkade is president of Kaminsky & Associates Inc., an independent consulting firm in Maumee, Ohio.\n\nThe National Business Group on Health (NBGH), which represents very large employers -- generally 5,000 or more workers -- has not seen a decline in HSA funding. But the organization also hasn't seen the level of funding reported in the UBA survey, perhaps due to differences in survey methodologies.\n\n\"Our median number is around $600 right now,\" said Karen Marlo, a vice president with the NBGH, a Washington, D.C.-based membership organization.\n\nShe said in addition to maintaining HSA contributions, large employers are helping consumers make the most of their health care dollars by providing second-opinion services and price transparency tools, for example.\n\nMore information\n\nLearn more about health savings accounts from the Mayo Clinic.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/health-technology-information-18/health-biz-news-346/employers-contributing-less-to-workers-health-savings-accounts-697730.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/images/editorial/money814.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "Enrollment in high-deductible plans is up, but employees are getting less help saving for expenses", "title": "Employers Contributing Less to Workers' Health Savings Accounts"}, "description": "Enrollment in high-deductible plans is up, but employees are getting less help saving for expenses", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda79b\"", "article_summary": "On average, employers contributed $890 toward the health savings accounts of workers with family health coverage in 2014, versus $958 the prior year -- a 7 percent decline.\nBusinesses were able to plunk the premium savings into employees' health savings accounts.\nThis refers to a type of health insurance coverage that combines a high-deductible health plan with a health savings account, or HSA.\nMore informationLearn more about health savings accounts from the Mayo Clinic.\nThe decrease in employer contributions to health savings accounts \"is a continuation of a trend that we've seen over the past couple of years,\" said Les McPhearson, CEO of the health benefits advisory firm."}
