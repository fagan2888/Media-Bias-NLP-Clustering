Men have much more expensive tastes than women when it comes to the used cars they find most appealing, according to a study from iSeeCars.com.

The top 10 models that men bought or studied at a disproportionately higher rate carried an average list price of $49,224, while the top 10 models that women preferred averaged $14,870.

Men, not surprisingly, were drawn to fancy sports cars and big pickup trucks. But the level of female frugality caught researchers off guard.

The models that women skewed toward the most cost 30 percent of those that men in the study wanted. Half of the models in the womenâ€™s top 10 were Korean, including four models from Kia.

The Hyundai Tucson, Nissan Versa and Volkswagen Beetle were the three cars women most favored.

In contrast, men gave the greatest preference to the Nissan GT-R, BMW M3 and Porsche Cayman.

The Massachusetts automotive data and research company looked at 54 million used-car sales and more than 570,000 online car shopper inquiries over a nearly three-year period to determine gender preferences.
