An Ohio man was sentenced Friday in Jefferson County court to six years in prison for sexually exploiting a 13-year-old Arvada girl over Skype last year.

Gregory Scott Kasarcik, 25, also faces 12 years as a registered, intensive supervision sex offender after his release, according to the county district attorney’s office.

Kasarcik met the teen on a social networking site and then asked her to move to Skype where he began to ask her sexual questions and make sexual demands.

“He threatened to blow up the girl’s computer if she didn’t comply with his demands that she perform certain sexually explicit acts,” the office said.

The girl, who had just received the new laptop for Christmas the month before, was afraid Kasarcik’s threats were real and complied. The girl later told a neighbor what had happened.

Arvada police began investigating and found the man lived in Ripley, Ohio and that he had previously — at least eight times — committed similar offenses against other young girls.

Kasarcik was taken into custody in February 2014 by the Brown County Sheriff’s Office in Ohio. He pleaded guilty to sexual exploitation of a child and extortion in November.
