Dr. Ben Carson, pediatric neurosurgeon and Fox News contributor, says America is doing health care "the completely wrong way."

In an interview with Fox News contributor Mallory Factor, Carson weighed in on the problems with America’s health care system and ObamaCare.

“Health care isn’t a right, but it is a responsibility for compassionate people,” Carson said. The problem isn't how much money is going into the system, but how it's being allocated, he said.

“We spend twice as much per capita in this country,” said Carson. “It’s not that we haven’t committed enough money, it’s we are doing it the completely wrong way.”

He said limited government involvement in health care is key. “Their role would be to make sure every American citizen has a health savings account which gets injected with $2,000 every year.”

When pressed on why Congress hasn’t reviewed this idea, he claimed “there are a number of people, particularly in the ‘Congressional Health Caucus’ who are talking about it.”

Carson plans to lay out in detail his proposal on his American Legacy PAC website.
