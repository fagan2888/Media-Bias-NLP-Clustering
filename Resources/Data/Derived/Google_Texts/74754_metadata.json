The producer behind Far Cry, Assassin\u2019s Creed, and Rayman appears to be trying something very new and different with their latest announcement for 2016.\n\nThis is not typical for Ubisoft, who seem to be going out of their way to rid themselves of the popular opinion that they just recycle their ideas every year. They attempted the same thing last year with Assassin\u2019s Creed: Unity, but they apparently weren\u2019t familiar enough with the technology to get the game released without a lot of glitches. Those glitches became the new reason to avoid the series, and Ubisoft is still trying to get it right.\n\nNow with Assassin\u2019s Creed Syndicate arriving this month, promising a whole new experience and possibly the most likable characters since Ezio Auditore, Ubisoft seems set to change up another major franchise.\n\nWhen Far Cry Primal\u2019s release date hits, it looks like it will turn the series on its head. Previous games have taken it to the tropics and the Himalayas, according to Coming Soon, while one even attempted to become an arcade-style parody on 80s action movies (Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon).\n\nIt is yet unknown if any particular groups might be ignored as playable characters this time since Ubisoft was central to a controversy last year. This controversy revealed how the producer had rarely made the central character a female, and in the ill-fated Watch Dogs, one of the major bosses ended up being a very stereotypical black gangster. Assassin\u2019s Creed Syndicate appears to be trying to change that with the inclusion of Evie Frye as a more stealth-heavy alternative to brother Jacob. Far Cry Primal appears to be starring aboriginal black characters, which is fitting for the time period.\n\nNot much is known of this latest Far Cry, but it appears to be one of the most ambitious ideas Ubisoft has had in years. The Far Cry Primal release date will bring us back to the Ice Age, to when the glaciers had finally given way to lush nature and mankind was not yet the dominant species on Earth.\n\nPolygon reports that on Ubisoft\u2019s official blog, the game\u2019s setting is quite different from previous entries, possibly setting up a surprise hit for the Far Cry Primal release date.\n\n\u201cLike any good hunter, Takkar (your character) carries an extensive set of survival skills, including the ability to craft tools and weapons from the bones of the beasts he slays and the resources he gathers in the wild. These are not only crucial for his own safety against predators (both human and animal), they\u2019re also essential in maintaining the safety of his tribe. Takkar will need to guard his fledgling group carefully to ensure its survival and growth.\u201d\n\nYes, hunting is back and hopefully as integral to the latest Far Cry as it was with Assassin\u2019s Creed: Black Flag. Far Cry Primal is set to drop you in the prehistoric Oros as the last surviving hunter in your tribe bent on ensuring their safety and claiming your place as the biggest predator.\n\nGamespot \u2013 Pc Far Cry Primal \u2013 Developer Diary: Find out what into the making of Far Cry Primal in this new d\u2026 http://t.co/gb4lrct3re \u2014 Arpad Tot Pal (@NtCsoft) October 6, 2015\n\nWhile the setting has been done before, it was rarely successful. Turok once tried to capitalize on the idea of hunting dinosaurs, but it seems Ubisoft is set on getting it right (if the Triceratops in the cave drawing is any indication).\n\nPre-order deals have been rumored, but they haven\u2019t been posted yet. Pre-order DLC for the game will include \u201cThe Legend Of The Mammoth Mission Pack,\u201d which may have gamers hunting down the ferocious wooly mammoth. Ubisoft has yet to reveal what it\u2019s about, and links have not yet gone active at this time.\n\nAre you excited to see Ubisoft\u2019s latest on the Far Cry Primal release date of February 23, 2016, for PS4 and Xbox One? The PC version is set for a March 2016 release window.\n\n[Feature image via PC Gamer]", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Far Cry Primal release date has been announced, and Ubisoft is up to some new tricks this time.
