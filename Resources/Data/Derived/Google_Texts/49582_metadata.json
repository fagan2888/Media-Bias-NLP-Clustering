That fits with his, and FMC\u2019s, approach to patients, he said, although it can be challenging for a public hospital.\n\n\u201cWe take care of everybody in this community, whether they have insurance or they don\u2019t,\u201d Biuso explained. \u201cThe literature is clear that people who don\u2019t have insurance are not in preventative mode, but we have programs where we try to keep them out of the hospital.\u201d\n\nOne way, he said, is through a discharge call team that follows up with patients to ensure they are taking their medicine, can afford their prescriptions and are able to get to appointments.\n\nFMC officials also are linking the hospital\u2019s wide network of physicians. A first step is to make sure patients have a timely appointment with their primary care physician once they\u2019re discharged, Biuso said, but the connections flow in all directions.\n\n\u201cWhenever there\u2019s a transition of care \u2014 when patients move from one level of care to another \u2014 it\u2019s important to have good communication,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have docs talking to docs.\u201d\n\nThe Medicare assessments use a formula that looks at readmissions of patients hospitalized for heart attacks, heart failure, COPD, pneumonia or elective hip or knee surgeries.\n\n\u201cAt Redmond Regional Medical Center, quality care is always our top priority. We remain committed to enhancing care through our quality initiatives. Through these efforts, we have already demonstrated improvement. Our current hospital-wide readmission rate is below the national rate as found on hospitalcompare.gov. We expect to see this continued improvement going forward,\" said Redmond Regional Medical Center Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Julie Barnes.\n\nThe most recent Medicare Hospital Compare report indicates Redmond\u2019s readmission rates differed from the national average only in regards to elective surgeries.\n\nUnplanned readmissions were at 6.4 percent, compared to an average of 4.8 percent nationally.\n\nGeorgia Health News, a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization, tracks state medical issues on its website georgiahealthnews.com.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Northwest Georgia News", "description": "Floyd County\u2019s two hospitals are among the 67 percent in Georgia that will pay a Medicare fine for having too many discharged patients return within a month for additional care.", "title": "FMC, Redmond facing readmission penalties; Medicare fines are part of healthcare reform", "url": "http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/rome/news/local/fmc-redmond-facing-readmission-penalties-medicare-fines-are-part-of/article_8ea33dde-3ce3-11e5-83b9-8385b86fc962.html", "image": {"width": 300, "identifier": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/northwestgeorgianews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/34/334062b6-4ca6-11e3-8319-001a4bcf6878/5283e7e7ba693.preview-300.jpg?resize=300%2C200", "height": 200}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@townnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@"}, "description": "Floyd County\u2019s two hospitals are among the 67 percent in Georgia that will pay a Medicare fine for having too many discharged patients return within a month for additional care.", "fb": {"admins": "100001414653607,710194472,654195704", "app_id": 551345941562032}, "keywords": "local,region,business", "news_keywords": "local,region,business"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4ed\"", "article_summary": "We expect to see this continued improvement going forward,\" said Redmond Regional Medical Center Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Julie Barnes.\nThe most recent Medicare Hospital Compare report indicates Redmond\u2019s readmission rates differed from the national average only in regards to elective surgeries.\n\u201cAt Redmond Regional Medical Center, quality care is always our top priority.\nGeorgia Health News, a nonprofit 501(c)3 organization, tracks state medical issues on its website georgiahealthnews.com.\nAt 1.02 percent, Redmond Regional Medical Center\u2019s fine is one of just 10 in the state that top 1 percent, according to a national spreadsheet prepared by Kaiser Health News."}
