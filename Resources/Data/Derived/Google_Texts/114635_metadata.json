But now I can\u2019t afford to live here anymore. I\u2019ll protest my appraisal notice, but that\u2019s not enough. Someone needs to step in and address the big picture.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m really just bringing this to your attention for this quote alone. Voting and paying are different endeavors entirely. Often, when one has to pay for the things one has voted to fund, that decision becomes less flippant. This is a comment, less on the specifics of Texas\u2019 or Austin\u2019s tax system than the blaring disconnect between liberals in Austin who are voting for higher taxes and the actual paying of the taxes. Which, as it turns out, is painful, discouraging, and can be a detriment to the fabric of the city.\n\nThe Texas Public Policy Foundation offers this on the complexity and salience of Texas property taxes:\n\nIn Texas, there are more than 3,900 localities that impose property taxes, including school districts, counties, and special districts. Texas\u2019 property tax burden has grown from approximately 1 percent of value in the early 1980s to nearly 3 percent today. The rising burden from property tax is worse for the housing-rich but income-poor elderly homeowners. For example, elderly homeowners tend to move more often to reduce their property tax burden, which is an additional cost of owning a home for those who can least afford to move. Interestingly, another reason voters hate property taxes is because they are more \u201csalient.\u201d A salient tax means that the burden is transparent, easy to understand, and hard to avoid. If paid directly, property taxes are found to be more salient compared with sales taxes applied at checkout or income taxes withheld from a paycheck.\n\nIn 2012, the free-market think tank suggested swapping the local property tax for a sales tax:\n\nNew research suggests that if Texas eliminates its local property tax system, ranked as the 14th most oppressive in the nation, and instead replaces those lost revenues with an adjusted sales tax, then the ensuing flood of capital investment and business activity could ignite the Texas economy for years to come. That\u2019s right, just by changing how Texas governments collect public dollars\u2014but not how much they spend\u2014the Legislature can give the economy and people\u2019s wallets a major boost. By how much, you ask? Our estimates suggest quite a bit.\n\nEither way, I don\u2019t think Gretchen Gardner is ever going to make the connection between her voting pattern and her bill.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Petard, hoisted.", "title": "Liberal Austin homeowners surprised to find they have to pay all the taxes they voted for", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/06/02/liberal-austin-homeowners-surprised-to-find-they-have-to-pay-all-the-taxes-they-voted-for/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Austin, liberals, property taxes, taxes, Texas,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-03T01:31:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-03T12:55:31+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd305f\"", "article_summary": "If paid directly, property taxes are found to be more salient compared with sales taxes applied at checkout or income taxes withheld from a paycheck.\nTexas\u2019 property tax burden has grown from approximately 1 percent of value in the early 1980s to nearly 3 percent today.\nLiberal Austin homeowners surprised to find they have to pay all the taxes they voted forposted at 9:31 pm on June 2, 2014 by Mary Katharine HamNIMBY, literally.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not because I don\u2019t like paying taxes,\u201d said Gardner, who attended both meetings.\nThe Texas Public Policy Foundation offers this on the complexity and salience of Texas property taxes:In Texas, there are more than 3,900 localities that impose property taxes, including school districts, counties, and special districts."}
