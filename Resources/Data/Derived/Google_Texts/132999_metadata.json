As I\u2019ve explained previously, powerful companies that stood to profit from widespread adoption of Common Core have won arguably non-competitive bids to supply Core-aligned materials to schools. Insulated from market competition, these actors have failed to deliver a workable product for students.\n\nWhile raising schools\u2019 standards is an aspirational goal, the transition has proved to be a massive disruption for many students. Consider the Los Angeles Unified School District, which spent millions of dollars on a disastrous iPad initiative but wasn\u2019t able to procure Core-aligned math textbooks for sixth and seventh graders. Since the new standards make substantial changes to what kids are supposed to learn at each grade level, having the wrong set of textbooks is a nightmare. Indeed, students all over the country are experiencing the joy of having a textbook that teaches one thing, a standardized test that measures something else entirely, and a hopelessly confused teacher caught in the middle. Common Core is exacerbating the very problems it was intended to fix.\n\nSeveral other Republican candidates spoke at the Education Summit; unlike Fiorina, not all of them oppose Common Core. Jeb Bush, for instance, is an ardent backer, though he has muted his enthusiasm to match dwindling Republican support for the standards. Education Next\u2019s 2015 poll, which I wrote about yesterday, showed that just 49 percent of the public like Common Core. That\u2019s down 15 percent since two years ago. Teachers are even more against Common Core than the general public, although much of that opposition is directed toward mandatory standardized testing rather than the standards themselves.\n\nRelated: \u201cThe Populist Uprising Against Common Core Is Libertarian and It\u2019s Winning.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Education standards exacerbate crony capitalism", "title": "Carly Fiorina Bashes Common Core: \u2018Overly Influenced By Companies That Have Something to Gain'", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/08/19/carly-fiorina-bashes-common-core-overly", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14400182598165.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Education standards exacerbate crony capitalism", "title": "Carly Fiorina Bashes Common Core: \u2018Overly Influenced By Companies That Have Something to Gain'", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14400182598165.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Policy", "published_time": "2015-08-19T21:15:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Of all the knocks against Common Core, the charge that it is a crony capitalist cash-grab for education companies may be the most justifiably enduring.\nSeveral other Republican candidates spoke at the Education Summit; unlike Fiorina, not all of them oppose Common Core.\nRelated: \u201cThe Populist Uprising Against Common Core Is Libertarian and It\u2019s Winning.\u201d\nEducation Next\u2019s 2015 poll, which I wrote about yesterday, showed that just 49 percent of the public like Common Core.\nAs I\u2019ve explained previously, powerful companies that stood to profit from widespread adoption of Common Core have won arguably non-competitive bids to supply Core-aligned materials to schools."}
