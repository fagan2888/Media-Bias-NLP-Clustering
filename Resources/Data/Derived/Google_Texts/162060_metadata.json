I mean, if I thought about bogeys, when am I going to make bogey; if I was afraid of the bogeys, I'd probably make bogeys. But I thought, whatever happens, it's just meant to be.\u201d\n\nStacy Lewis had a bogey on the final hole for a 72 that left her in third place, four strokes off the lead.\n\nAzahara Munoz, who was runner-up last year, tied for fourth at 10-under with Shanshan Feng and So Yeon Ryu.\n\nDefending champion Paula Creamer had a 74 to tie for 55th place.\n\n===\n\nAlex Cejka won the Puerto Rico Open in Rio Grande for his first PGA Tour title, making a 15-foot birdie putt on the first hole of a five-man playoff.\n\nThe 44-year-old Czech-born German won in his 287th start on the PGA Tour. A four-time European Tour winner, he birdied four of the first six holes and finished with a three-under 69 in rainy, windy conditions at Trump International-Puerto Rico.\n\nSam Saunders, Arnold Palmer's grandson, had a chance to force another playoff hole, but his 8-foot birdie try on the par-five 18th went to the right. Jon Curran, Tim Petrovic and Argentina's Emiliano Grillo also were in the playoff.\n\nGrillo and Curran shared the lead at eight under with one hole left in regulation, but closed with bogeys in the second-to-last group. Grillo settled for a 70 after missed a short putt. Curran also had a 70. Petrovic shot a 67, and Saunders had a 68.\n\n===\n\nTrevor Fisher Jr. finished with a 64 to win the Africa Open by five shots for his first European Tour title.\n\nThe South African had nine birdies and a single bogey in his final round to finish on 24-under 264 overall, well clear of England's Matt Ford (67) in second, in East London, South Africa.\n\nEduardo de la Riva, Jorge Campillo and Morten Orum Madsen were a further three shots behind Ford at East London Golf Club.\n\nFisher Jr. had a two-shot overnight lead over Ford, who stayed in contention in the final round until a two-shot swing at No. 9, where Fisher made birdie and Ford made bogey.\n\nThe result continues South Africa's dominance at the Africa Open. Home players have now won eight straight editions of the tournament.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Inbee Park wins HSBC Women's Champions golf tournament", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 AP Member Choice Complete", "author": "AP Member Choice Complete", "og": {"site_name": "latimes.com", "description": "Inbee Park claimed her 13th career LPGA title by winning the HSBC Women's Champions on Sunday, shooting a two-under 70 in the final round to win by two strokes.", "title": "Inbee Park wins HSBC Women's Champions golf tournament", "url": "http://www.latimes.com/sports/sportsnow/la-sp-golf-roundup-20150308-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54fc54b8/turbine/la-sp-golf-roundup-20150308", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp09.13", "twitter": {"site": "@latimes", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Inbee Park, golf, sports", "fb": {"admins": 100000786395051, "page_id": 5863113009}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=373238146, app-argument=http://www.latimes.com/deeplinkid/83004879", "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-03-08", "Description": "Inbee Park claimed her 13th career LPGA title by winning the HSBC Women's Champions on Sunday, shooting a two-under 70 in the final round to win by two strokes.
