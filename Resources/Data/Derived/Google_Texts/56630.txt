As the 20th International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2014) opened in Melbourne, Australia on Sunday, July 20, 2014, we had the chance to speak with Dr. Carl Dieffenbach. He’s the Director of the Division of AIDS at NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). During our brief conversation, Dr. Dieffenbach reflects on the conference theme, “Stepping Up the Pace,” and discusses some of the topics that will be addressed at the conference as participants work towards achieving an AIDS-free generation. He acknowledges new data on global HIV/AIDS released in the UNAIDS “Gap Report .”

Watch Dr. Dieffenbach’s brief remarks below.

This week, Dr. Dieffenbach will be sharing scientific highlights from the conference with AIDS.gov. Check back tomorrow for the next one.
