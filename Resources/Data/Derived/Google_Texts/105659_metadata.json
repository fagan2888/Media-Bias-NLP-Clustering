I did not attend the meeting due to some theoretical interest in the topic; for me, it\u2019s personal.\n\nMy mother and grandmother suffered from the condition, and so does my brother. It causes gradual loss of muscle function, notably in the face, and in the muscles that mobilize the shoulder blades and the upper arm, but also in the legs.\n\nMy brother first developed symptoms when he was 15, and found that he could no longer run as fast as his high school soccer teammates. Since the age of 43, he has been confined to a wheelchair or scooter, unable to walk or stand.\n\nBut at the conference in August, I also realized that this illness with such a profound impact on my family, also has a global reach. Indeed, in regions like Africa, the condition is only just beginning to be acknowledged.\n\nEnter: Chris Chege\n\nI first saw Chege sitting on a tall stool at the back of the room with his wife. Their presence proved that the condition affects Africans, too, something that isn\u2019t widely acknowledged. Chege and his wife had traveled to Boston from their home in Thika, in central Kenya, 30 miles Northeast of Nairobi.\n\nAn interview with Chege pointed to one possible reason that conference room was full, mainly, of white people: most people with the condition in Africa may not have been diagnosed with it yet.\n\nBut Chege said he sees others with FSHD in Kenya. He said he can tell.\u201dBy the way they walk,\u201d he said. \u201cI see them on national television when journalists go to their homes to interview them.\u201d\n\nThe television journalists, Chege says, report that the families he sees on television with the symptoms of FSHD are bewitched.\n\n\u201cThe way they walk I can tell that\u2019s muscular dystrophy,\u201d he said.\n\nHis own condition was a mystery to him for nearly twenty years.\n\nWhen he was a teenager, he first realized that he could not keep up with other people. \u201cBack home, my father was a farmer,\u201d Chege said. \u201cWe used to pick coffee berries from our farm. Once we pick the coffee berries, we have to take them to a processing machine, and you take what you pick.\u201d\n\nChege would have to carry 45 lbs of coffee berries at a time. One day, he found that he was unable to carry so many berries. \u201cI used to receive a lot of beatings from my father and my mother because they thought I was just lazy,\u201d he said.\n\nChege decided on his own to see a doctor, who gave him medication that produced \u201ca lot\u201d of side effects on him, he said.\n\nThere are no medications approved anywhere for the treatment of FSHD.\n\nIt was not until the year 2000, at the age of 34, that he was diagnosed with muscular dystrophy.\n\n\u201cLife is very harsh having a muscular dystrophy condition, because in my town, it\u2019s very hilly, so walking around is quite difficult, and if I have to walk around, I have to have somebody to help me, and you see, almost everybody is busy,\u201d he said.\n\nSo most of the time, Chege said, he sits at home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually very, very harsh in Africa,\u201d he said.\n\nChege and his wife have two boys, 16 and 10. \u201cThe way they behave during their daily activities, she senses they may be affected also,\u201d he said\n\nChege found out about the FSH Society\u2019s biannual conferences that bring together patients, their families, and researchers.\n\nPeter Jones was one of the researchers at the conference who met with Chege. Jones is conducting research at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. The genetic sequence that causes FSHD, known as 4q35 D4Z4, is present in healthy people as well as people affected by the disorder. In healthy people, the sequence is suppressed. For some reason, in people affected by FSHD, the suppression mechanism doesn\u2019t work. Jones is trying to figure out why.\n\n\u201cI decided to come to this conference in Boston to meet other patients who have the same condition and also to learn more about this condition and also to meet the scientists, the doctors and to gather more information so that I can be able to educate others back home,\u201d Chege said.\n\nBut the trip to Boston was expensive. He had to sell some of his land in order to travel to the conference.\n\n\u201cMost of my friends, family members, thought I was mad,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, knowledge is more than those properties.\u201d\n\nHe was not able to afford bringing the entire family, so the boys stayed in Kenya.\n\nChege said because his wife was able to attend the conference, she has gained understanding into his condition.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t regret disposing some of my properties to come here,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the conference, he said, researchers offered to test him. He had a discussion with a physiotherapist who taught him what he could do on his own at home.\n\nBefore coming to Boston, Chege said he was not aware that any research on FSHD was being done in Africa; in fact, research is currently underway in South Africa.\n\nBut Chege would like to return to the U.S. in two years to attend the next conference on FSHD, only next time, he hopes to bring his sons along as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "My brother first developed symptoms when he was 15, and found that he could no longer run as fast as his high school soccer teammates.
