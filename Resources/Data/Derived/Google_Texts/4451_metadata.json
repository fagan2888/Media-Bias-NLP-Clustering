Even the candidates themselves seem to be having problems.\n\nDuring the Oct. 21, 2014, CNN debate in Jacksonville, Democrat Charlie Crist seemed to mix his talking points when it came to insurance rates.\n\n\"We haven't had a hurricane in eight years and your property insurance rates have gone through the roof. Now why is that? I'll tell you why,\" he said . \"It is because Rick Scott is not letting the department of insurance regulate insurance. He actually signed a bill last year that said that the Department of Insurance Regulation cannot regulate insurance.\"\n\nBecause we have a fairly long memory here at PolitiFact Florida, that didn\u2019t sound right to us. Crist\u2019s campaign told us they didn\u2019t want to expound on this any more, so we looked into it ourselves. We found that Crist is actually using two unrelated attacks at once here, so stick with us and we\u2019ll sort this out.\n\nProperty insurance\n\nThe first part of this claim notes that property insurance has gone up. This attack has been a linchpin in the Crist campaign, and we\u2019ve rated it Mostly True in the past.\n\nThe reason has nothing to do with the state\u2019s Office of Insurance Regulation, though (we\u2019ll get to that in a minute). It\u2019s because Scott signed SB 408 , a 2011 law that allowed a reduction in overall coverage limits, shortened the window for filing sinkhole and storm-related damage claims, and limited claims for damage caused by sinkholes to primary structures, among other things.\n\nBut instead of limiting the Office of Insurance Regulation\u2019s power, the law made carriers file requests with the office for rate increases for higher reinsurance costs -- effectively insurance bought by insurance companies -- and capping those requests at 15 percent per year. The law also allowed insurers to pay back some claims at actual cash value -- the cost of the insured dwelling minus depreciation -- instead of replacement value, depending on the policy.\n\nScott\u2019s plan indeed was to reduce the number of policies run by state-run insurer Citizens, and the legislation worked to that end. It reversed a Crist-era trend of more property owners depending on the agency.\n\nThe law did reduce coverage and it did raise rates, because its intent was for Citizens to become \"actuarially sound.\" This was accomplished through \"taking out\" policies that were assumed by private companies and charging more in order to balance costs.\n\nNow that the reinsurance market has stabilized after spiking following busy hurricane years in 2004 and 2005, Citizens and other companies this year have asked the state if it\u2019s all right to reduce their rates, but many people in Florida are still stuck with high insurance bills and are unable to afford the coverage they need.\n\nHealth insurance\n\nNow, to Crist\u2019s point about the state\u2019s Office of Insurance Regulation being unable to regulate insurance.\n\nThis goes back to May 2013, when Scott signed SB 1842 . That indeed was a bill that suspended Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty\u2019s power to regulate insurance for two years. But it was health insurance, not property insurance. We\u2019ve looked at this one a couple of different ways , too.\n\nIt was a response to the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which said state law had to follow minimum federal guidelines for insurance plans. The federal health law said insurance providers also had to justify unreasonable rate increases, defined as more than 10 percent per year.\n\nThe GOP-controlled Legislature was so opposed to the law that it said the federal government could regulate health insurance rates instead of the state. The law said insurers still file rate proposals to OIR, but they didn\u2019t need the agency\u2019s approval.\n\nThe problem is, the federal law doesn\u2019t give Washington the power to regulate rate increases. Instead, it says the federal government will defer to state agencies. It even provided grant money to help state\u2019s get up to snuff -- Scott gave back $1 million the state received for this purpose.\n\nThe only time D.C. gets involved is if a state\u2019s system doesn\u2019t meet federal standards to review rates, as is the case in Alabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. Florida\u2019s system is just fine, the Department of Health and Human Services said. That makes Florida the only state that doesn\u2019t regulate rates despite having a qualified review system.\n\nFor 2015, 14 insurance companies filed plans for rate increases averaging 13.2 percent. Those numbers will likely go down before final rates are set, but the 2013 law prevents McCarty\u2019s agency from doing anything until next year.\n\nOur ruling\n\nCrist said property insurance rates are up because Scott signed a bill preventing state from regulating insurance.\n\nThere are actually two bills involved here: One in 2011 concerning property insurance that effectively let rates go up while reducing coverage, and another in 2013 that prevents the state\u2019s regulatory agency from having a say in health insurance rates for two years.\n\nScott signed both those bills, but they are not interchangeable. Crist mixed his talking points here, but the result confuses the issues.
