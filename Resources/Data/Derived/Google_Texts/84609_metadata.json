It just happened.\n\n\"To be honest, after the first couple of years, when we struggled so much, I didn't know if I would get a third season,\" Sutton said. \"Since then, we've had some good players, good seasons and I really like it here.\n\n\"Maybe we've had a couple of chances to go somewhere else, but I never felt like it was a better situation for myself and my family. So, here we are in our 15th season. It really is kind of amazing.\"\n\nOklahoma State has had three coaches during that same period. OU has had three. Tulsa has employed five.\n\nIf Sutton coaches at Oral Roberts next season, it'll be his fourth league as the ORU coach: Mid-Continent, Summit, Southland and Summit again.\n\nOral Roberts is in the midst of a tough stretch in the Southland Conference, having played Stephen F. Austin, this year's league favorite, on Thursday, and taking on Northwestern State, last year's league champ, on Saturday at the Mabee Center.\n\nThe Golden Eagles have struggled at times this year as they adjust to life without point guard Obi Emegano, a star in the victory over Tulsa who suffered a season-ending injury early in the year.\n\nStill, ORU would appear to have enough talent to be a factor by the Southland Conference Tournament, where an NCAA Tournament bid will be handed out to the winner.\n\n\"We understand the situation,\" Sutton said. \"That's life in a one-bid league. You have to gear the entire season for that one week and then hope you have three good games in a row in you.\n\n\"At this time of year, it is all about molding your team, trying to win the league and get as high of a seed as you can for the conference tournament. This is the way it has been my entire time at ORU.\"\n\nThat's one of the great things about longevity, especially at Oral Roberts. Sutton understands the pluses and minuses of coaching at ORU. He understands the school and the type of athletes who will flourish at ORU and the ones who won't.\n\n\"It is different here and we understand that and perhaps work differently, especially in recruiting,\" Sutton said. \"To be honest, who you recruit is more important here than a lot of places because this place is different.\n\n\"I know this school pretty well after nearly 20 years (he also had four years as an ORU assistant). You have to know the kind of kids that will fit at this school. You have to understand the type of athlete that will thrive in this atmosphere and the ones who won't.\"\n\nSutton has had chances to leave. He had the job at Wichita State at one point. He was close to landing another job in the Missouri Valley Conference.\n\nHe was considered one of the top candidates at Tulsa just two years ago.\n\nFor whatever reason, Sutton remains at ORU.\n\n\"I had a coach once tell me that seven or eight years is probably long enough at one place,\" Sutton said. \"For every year that you are at a school, a certain percentage of the fan base will turn on you.\n\n\"But I think some of that depends on how you treat people. How do you deal with your fans, your players, your administration and the media? Then there is always the issue of how successful you are. In the end, if you realize how happy you are, you stay longer. I've stayed longer.\"\n\nWhen Sutton had chances to go he has always fallen back to what he knows and how he has been treated.\n\n\"Seriously, Oral Roberts gave me an unbelievable opportunity when I was such a young guy,\" Sutton said. \"To be honest, I was probably too young. But they gave me the chance and then stuck with me through some tough times.\n\n\"Every time I've thought about changing I've thought about their loyalty to me. Loyalty runs both directions.\"", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "Scott Sutton has been at Oral Roberts longer than the three other major college coaches in Oklahoma combined.", "title": "John Klein: Scott Sutton's longevity at ORU marked in loyalty", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/johnklein/john-klein-scott-sutton-s-longevity-at-oru-marked-in/article_250d9845-2d3b-5f30-9cac-8c0570f60058.html", "image": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/app/tulsa_world_ogimage.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "sutton,loyalty,oru,klein,season,league,oral,roberts,conference,john,johnklein,collegebasketball,oru,mensbasketball,mensbasketball,ou,mensbasketball,sportsextra,sportsextralatest", "news_keywords": "sutton,loyalty,oru,klein,season,league,oral,roberts,conference,john,johnklein,collegebasketball,oru,mensbasketball,mensbasketball,ou,mensbasketball,sportsextra,sportsextralatest", "description": "Scott Sutton has been at Oral Roberts longer than the three other major college coaches in Oklahoma combined."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd01a1\"", "article_summary": "Scott Sutton has been at Oral Roberts longer than the three other major college coaches in Oklahoma combined.\nThat's one of the great things about longevity, especially at Oral Roberts.\n\"To be honest, after the first couple of years, when we struggled so much, I didn't know if I would get a third season,\" Sutton said.\n\"Seriously, Oral Roberts gave me an unbelievable opportunity when I was such a young guy,\" Sutton said.\nIf Sutton coaches at Oral Roberts next season, it'll be his fourth league as the ORU coach: Mid-Continent, Summit, Southland and Summit again."}
