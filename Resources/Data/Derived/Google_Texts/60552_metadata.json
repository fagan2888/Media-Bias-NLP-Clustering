Methane emissions from hydraulically fractured natural gas wells are down 79 percent in that period. Further, greenhouse gas pollution, which had been rising by about 2.4 percent per year, slowed in 2014 and actually declined in 2015 according to a study published last week in the journal, Nature Climate Change.\n\nDespite those facts and the progress they represent, EPA has decided to implement more burdensome government regulations on the oil and gas industry.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe EPA wants regulations to drive methane emissions down 40 percent by 2025. This duplicative, costly regulation will prove very damaging to an oil and gas sector already struggling with plummeting prices. This is regulation \u201cbecause I can,\u201d rather than \u201cbecause it\u2019s logical or needed.\u201d\n\nIn pressing for these regulations, the EPA seems to be ignoring the facts. US carbon emissions have been fallen an average of 1.4 percent per year for most of the past decade. Western Europe\u2019s emissions are following the same path. Even China\u2019s carbon pollution is down by nearly 4 percent. All these changes took place as the world economy has been improving.\n\nFurther, EPA is either ignoring -- or may not understand -- how important the energy industry is to our country. We all know oil and gas provides fuel for our cars, homes, and businesses. Fewer people know that oil and gas provide raw materials for many American businesses. But many in EPA and out, may not realize the sector provides 9.8 million jobs and represents a direct eight percent of the nation\u2019s economy.\n\nA recent NERA Economic Consulting study commissioned by the American Council on Capital Formation found major flaws in the EPA\u2019s rationale for its new rule. It concluded that EPA\u2019s claimed benefits under the new rule could lead to net costs, instead of net benefits.\n\nThe oil and gas industry has the strongest record on greenhouse gas emissions in the world. It leads in technological advancements, something Congress and EPA often overlook. U.S. companies have been at the forefront of efforts to improve the environmental footprint from the well to the marketplace.\n\nIn recent years, oil and gas production has dramatically increased due to new discoveries and technological advances. At the same time, methane emissions have continued to decline. As the industry continues its rapid pace of innovation, these advances will continue \u2013 if the regulators stay out the way.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to innovate when federal regulators decide they know what\u2019s best. Yet the EPA pressed its analysis and proposed rule without vigorous scientific peer review. Any regulation this costly to the nation, with this many more questions than answers and with more \u201cI can\u201d than \u201cI should\u201d needs \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 a much more thorough vetting.\n\nBut the Agency moved with little warning and with all the haste it could muster in hopes of winning some plaudits at the French Global Warming sessions. The comment period on the EPA\u2019s rule is now closed \u2013 it\u2019s all up to the bureaucracy to decide how to proceed with a proposed rule that is clearly and blatantly regulatory overreach.\n\nWhen an industry initiates and carries out actions that clean the environment economically, the nation benefits and so does the EPA. It should recognize those benefits and seek to avoid excessive costs and bureaucratization. This regulatory \u201cpolicy\u201d is unnecessary, excessive the wrongheaded. Why not stand aside and let innovation succeed?\n\nRafuse is a former White House energy adviser and current principal of the Rafuse Organization, which advises on energy, international trade and national security..", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "This is regulation \u201cbecause I can,\u201d rather than \u201cbecause it\u2019s logical or needed.\u201d", "description": "This is regulation \u201cbecause I can,\u201d rather than \u201cbecause it\u2019s logical or needed.\u201d", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Congress Blog"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "This is regulation \u201cbecause I can,\u201d rather than \u201cbecause it\u2019s logical or needed.\u201d", "title": "Industry innovation, not costly regulations, will reduce methane emissions", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/264055-industry-innovation-not-costly-regulations-will-reduce", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/264055-industry-innovation-not-costly-regulations-will-reduce", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-24T09:00-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Joe Picard", "author": "Jack Rafuse, Ph.D.", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-24T09:00:03-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-environment/264055-industry-innovation-not-costly-regulations-will-reduce", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "This is regulation \u201cbecause I can,\u201d rather than \u201cbecause it\u2019s logical or needed.\u201d", "card": "summary", "title": "Industry innovation, not costly regulations, will reduce methane emissions"}, "dcterms.title": "Industry innovation, not costly regulations, will reduce methane emissions"}, "article_summary": "According to the Environmental Protection Agency, America\u2019s natural gas industry has cut methane emissions by 11 percent in the past decade.\nThe oil and gas industry has the strongest record on greenhouse gas emissions in the world.\nADVERTISEMENTThe EPA wants regulations to drive methane emissions down 40 percent by 2025.\nMethane emissions from hydraulically fractured natural gas wells are down 79 percent in that period.\nDespite those facts and the progress they represent, EPA has decided to implement more burdensome government regulations on the oil and gas industry."}
