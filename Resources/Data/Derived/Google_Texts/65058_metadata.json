(Photo: Charlie Nye/The Star)Buy Photo\n\nIndiana Sen. Mike Delph, R-Carmel, did the right thing.\n\nOn Tuesday, the same day that the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump, reiterated in a debate his call for a ban on Muslims entering the United States and refused to call Muslims serving in the U.S. military \u201cpatriots,\u201d Delph went a different direction.\n\nThe conservative Indiana lawmaker created a forum at the Indiana Statehouse for Hoosier Muslims to speak some basic truths.\n\nThose Muslim Hoosiers said the things that all thinking people already know.\n\nThey said they love America.\n\nThey detest the murderous violence that brought grief and tragedy, most recently, in Paris and San Bernardino.\n\nThey said that people who murder others in the name of Allah don\u2019t embody the Islamic faith; they betray it.\n\nAnd they said that they view Trump\u2019s call for a ban on allowing all Muslims to enter the United States as \u201ca personal insult.\u201d\n\nAmen to all of that.\n\nDelph and I have had our differences. I poked fun at a Twitter rampage he went on a couple of years ago after the demise of Indiana\u2019s proposed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, which he supported. I\u2019ve also made sport of his tendency to deliver hyperbolic sound bites and his sometimes expansive sense of his place in the universe.\n\nHe took umbrage, which is his right.\n\nIn this instance, though, Delph is on the side of the angels.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he understands a fundamental truth that many other conservatives \u2013 and many other social conservatives, including Gov. Mike Pence \u2013 don\u2019t seem to.\n\nIn the last session of the General Assembly, those conservatives turned Indiana into a national and international joke and nearly ripped the state in two by ramming through the legislative process an ill-advised Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The fall-out from the controversy was so great that legislative leaders hurried back to the table before the session\u2019s end to craft a \u201cfix\u201d that pleased almost no one \u2013 and, in fact, now is being challenged in court.\n\nThe refrain from social conservatives through the entire RFRA debacle was that the \u201crights\u201d of people of faith had to be protected from a government that seemed determined to disparage or deny those rights.\n\nSocial conservatives adhered to that argument despite the fact that Indiana state government is led by a governor, attorney general, House speaker and Senate president pro tempore who are conservative themselves and don\u2019t exactly separate their religious beliefs from the performance of their public duties. Social conservatives also clung to their case despite rejoinders from some of us that the Bill of Rights established religious liberty and does a pretty darn good job of protecting it.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter. The notion that they\u2019re being persecuted if they can\u2019t discriminate against others is a bedrock belief among social conservatives and they are entitled to their beliefs.\n\nBut here\u2019s the rub: They can\u2019t logically say that their fight is about preserving religious liberty \u2013 the expression of religious belief \u2013 if they also are willing to deny that liberty to other people of faith.\n\nMuslims, for instance.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing about rights. Either everyone has them or no one does. If they can be waived, revoked or denied \u2013 particularly through the arbitrary exercise of government power \u2013 then they really aren\u2019t rights.\n\nThey\u2019re privileges.\n\nFree people don\u2019t have privileges.\n\nFree people have rights.\n\nDelph seems to get what so many other self-proclaimed social conservatives do not. The fight for respect by Muslim Hoosiers and Americans is \u2013 or should be \u2013 conservatives\u2019 fight, too.\n\nFaith is faith.\n\nAnd freedom is freedom.\n\nThose who would deny people the full protection of the law on the basis of their faith or their national origin can\u2019t plausibly claim to be defenders of freedom, religious or otherwise.\n\nDelph seems to grasp that.\n\nAnd that is why, in this case, Mike Delph is right.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://indy.st/1YsS7i2", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "The conservative Indiana lawmaker created a forum at the Indiana Statehouse for Hoosier Muslims to speak some basic truths.", "og": {"site_name": "Indianapolis Star", "description": "The conservative Indiana lawmaker created a forum at the Indiana Statehouse for Hoosier Muslims to speak some basic truths.", "title": "Krull: Mike Delph is right about Muslims in America", "url": "http://www.indystar.com/story/opinion/columnists/2015/12/19/krull-mike-delph-right-muslims-america/77528334/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/indystar.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The conservative Indiana lawmaker created a forum at the Indiana Statehouse for Hoosier Muslims to speak some basic truths.", "title": "Krull: Mike Delph is right about Muslims in America", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/622c58491028624c8016baeb42016479bffc1f2e/c=222-0-2640-2418&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/12/17/Indianapolis/B9320140179Z.1_20151217223209_000_GPBCSQDL5.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@indystar", "site": "@indystar", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=559965350", "fb": {"app_id": 108716282521686}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Places/Schools", "gci-asset-type": "Story", "gci-categories": "Places/Schools", "title": "Krull: Mike Delph is right about Muslims in America", "author": "John Krull", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/columnists", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/572a680572c6339128808293624578b5c94fd2b3/c=524-0-2338-2418/local/-/media/2015/12/17/Indianapolis/B9320140179Z.1_20151217223209_000_GPBCSQDL5.1-0.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4cc03880a6ba975377d2f9cddfcc9ff0ce28b7b4/c=222-0-2640-2418/local/-/media/2015/12/17/Indianapolis/B9320140179Z.1_20151217223209_000_GPBCSQDL5.1-0.jpg", "contenttype": "Story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8466a6bf74e60de88b1829b96dcf0c1d425ee16a/c=0-136-2861-2282/local/-/media/2015/12/17/Indianapolis/B9320140179Z.1_20151217223209_000_GPBCSQDL5.1-0.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/efafff5ea42b82f98d9bc0459563be78985def5c/c=0-404-2861-2013&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/12/17/Indianapolis/B9320140179Z.1_20151217223209_000_GPBCSQDL5.1-0.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-12-19T18:05:37.373000-05:00", "shorthed": "Krull: Mike Delph is right about Muslims in America", "articleid": 77528334, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c3ca7aa51c52b0083a4fcb5a91dff4ad61026398/c=0-404-2861-2013/local/-/media/2015/12/17/Indianapolis/B9320140179Z.1_20151217223209_000_GPBCSQDL5.1-0.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cce862019173eb3dab4a4c205fd386200e82ad7f/c=750-0-2110-2418/local/-/media/2015/12/17/Indianapolis/B9320140179Z.1_20151217223209_000_GPBCSQDL5.1-0.jpg"}}}, "article_summary": "(Photo: Charlie Nye/The Star)Buy PhotoIndiana Sen.
