Expressing his disappointment they would not be able to hear him speak, Cruz offered to take photos with his campaign followers to make up for the inconvenience and spent about 15 minutes greeting them before heading inside.\n\nTX Senator Ted Cruz poses with supporters outside packed campaign rally. pic.twitter.com/STQfX4MR40 \u2014 Kipp Jones (@kipjones) August 14, 2015\n\nInside the event, which filled up well before Cruz\u2019s arrival, an anxious crowd listened as Rep.

A majority of the candidates standing on that stage have previously supported amnesty. I have never supported amnesty, I have always opposed amnesty and indeed I led the fight to stop Chuck Schumer\u2019s amnesty program that was supported by a great many Republicans. I stood shoulder to shoulder with Jeff Sessions to defeat amnesty.\u201d\n\nWhether it is opposing amnesty or standing up to Planned Parenthood, Cruz says all of the candidates in the Republican field have spoken up, but only a handful have been consistent. \u201cI believe we should defund Planned Parenthood altogether,\u201d he stated. \u201cWe should not send one penny of taxpayer money to an organization that has now been caught on tape in what appears to be a pattern of multiple felonies that is ongoing.\u201d\n\nCruz added: \u201cIt is not sufficient to simply say we\u2019re spending taxpayer funds for one division of the ongoing criminal enterprise, rather than anther division. We should defund Planned Parenthood across the board. Beyond that, the Department of Justice should investigate this criminal conduct and prosecute any and all crimes that investigation uncovers.\u201d\n\nCruz also called out candidates who were absent during the fight over Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act earlier this year.\n\n\u201cEvery candidate on the stage says he supports protecting religious liberty.\u201d Cruz told Breitbart.\n\nThe battle in Indiana just a few months ago was a time for choosing. It was a line in the sand. More than a few Republicans, including more than a few candidates on that stage were nowhere to be found in the battle for religious liberty in Indiana. I think Republican primary voters want to know when your right to live according to your conscience and faith is being threatened. Who has stood up to defend religious liberty? I have spent two decades of my life fighting to defend religious liberty, and I have a long proven record of doing so.\n\nCruz also feels strongly his positions on illegal immigration and amnesty prove the Republican Party can appeal to Hispanic voters.\n\n\u201cIn 2012, in the state of Texas, I earned 40 percent of the Hispanic vote, statewide. That was at the exact same time Mitt Romney was getting clobbered with 27 percent of the Hispanic vote nationwide,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe mainstream media will constantly tell you the reason Romney did poorly among the Hispanics is because of immigration.\u201d\n\nWhen I was earning 40 percent of the Hispanic vote I ran unequivocally opposed to amnesty and in support of securing the border, however I also told my father\u2019s story, of his coming as a penniless immigrant from Cuba, not speaking English, seeking the American dream. That is a story that ties all of us together. It ties the Hispanic community together, but it ties every American together. We are all the children of those who risked everything for liberty. In the Hispanic community, our values are fundamentally conservative. Faith, family, patriotism, hard work and the American dream. We need Republican candidates who can go and communicate those values in a way that resonates and connects with hardworking Hispanics, who want a better future for their children.\n\nCruz also offered solutions for U.S. military veterans, struggling to fight for suitable healthcare.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be accountability for those responsible for the unjustifiable delays in life-saving treatment,\u201d Cruz said with a tone of conviction. \u201cWe need to ensure we honor the commitment that was made to every one of our veterans\u2026 we need to reform the VA system so that every veteran can see the doctor of his or her choice. If you want to go to the VA, you should be able to do so, but if you want to go see a cardiologist at the hospital down the street, you should be able to do that as well. We need to give vets true choices.\u201d\n\nIn regards to repealing Obamacare, Cruz said every GOP candidate states they are opposed to the unpopular law, but most have refused to take up the fight: \u201cWhen Mike Lee and I were leading the fight, along with millions of Americans to defund Obamacare, very few of the candidates on that stage stood with us when the battle was being waged.\u201d\n\nThe Texas Senator left Tulsa at dusk Thursday, with a still-energized crowd visible in the rearview mirror of his red, white, and blue campaign bus.
