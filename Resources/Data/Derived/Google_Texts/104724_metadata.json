But if you can both level with each other, you'll both benefit.\n\nThere\u2019s most likely been a time each of us has had to deal with a boss whose intentions weren\u2019t quite clear \u2014 whether it was at a current job or that junky retail job you had in high school. It\u2019s especially troubling having to decipher every interaction with them, wondering each time if there\u2019s some hidden meaning behind what they\u2019re saying, if they have a plan against you, and if they even like you. It\u2019s easy to see how damaging this type of relationship can be, no matter which way the feelings go. A new study now finds it\u2019s important to move past this mystery in the interest of simply doing a good job at work.\n\nBased on his new study, lead investigator Fadel Matta, a management researcher at Michigan State University\u2019s Broad College of Business, believes that \u201cseeing eye to eye about the employee-supervisor relationship is equally, if not more important than the actual quality of the relationship,\u201d he said in a statement. Even if it\u2019s a poor quality relationship, the fact that both manager and subordinate can be honest with each other is enough to form mutual respect, and in doing so, it motivates both to focus on their work while taking stress \u2014 at least what\u2019s not work-related \u2014 out of the workplace.\n\nStudies have shown that these poor relationships cause stress, and subsequent symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, sleep problems, high blood pressure, memory loss, and substance abuse. A study from July, which took place in Norway, found that managers who had good relationships with their subordinates were far less stressed. Meanwhile, another, slightly older study, found a total of 26 percent of employees said problems with supervisor was a \u201csomewhat significant\u201d or \u201cvery significant\u201d factor causing work-related stress. (Of course, other factors such as \u201cundefined job expectations\u201d and job insecurity were rated as more pressing, but people obviously see that problems with their bosses create a stressful environment.)\n\nFor the study, Matta looked at how 280 employees \u2014 coming from a range of industries, including automotive, retail, and finance \u2014 felt about their bosses and vice-versa. The team interviewed each person without letting the other know about their feelings, and came to the conclusion that motivation was higher when both leveled with each other. \u201cSome people would say it\u2019s better to fake it, but our results indicate the opposite is true,\u201d Matta said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s better for everyone to know where they stand, and how they feel about each other.\u201d\n\nSource: Matta F, Koopman J, Scott B, Conlon D.
