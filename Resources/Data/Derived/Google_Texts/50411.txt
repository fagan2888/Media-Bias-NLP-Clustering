EAST HANOVER, N.J. -- Honey Maid is embarking on the third year of its "This Is Wholesome" campaign, appealing to consumers with stories of families who have been brought closer together through one thing: acceptance.

"Our new campaign creative taps into a cultural insight that is rooted in the change of the American family dynamic," said Katrina Plummer, equity brand manager, Honey Maid, Mondelez International. "In 2016, we're encouraging Americans to view the world through the eyes of acceptance – and remember that no matter how families might change, just like our products, what makes them wholesome remains the same."

The omnichannel campaign features five real American families (one of which is pictured above) – including those that spotlight an adopted son, a disabled veteran, a Hispanic gay couple and neighbors of different cultures – each sharing their story of acceptance with the intent of inviting viewers to think about acceptance in their own lives.

Honey Maid is also introducing the Wholesome Button: a browser app that allows users to experience the Internet through the lens of acceptance and positivity. Once added, users simply click the "Wholesomize It" bookmark in their bookmarks bar anytime they desire to replace images and headlines on their screen with content celebrating love, family connections and acceptance.

"This tool truly allows users to view the Internet through the lens of acceptance and positivity, something that is part of our brand DNA," said Plummer. "By giving people the opportunity to connect with our campaign and share a reimagined world, we hope to bring wholesome families closer together, invite people to think about acceptance in their own lives and even start a dialogue with someone within their own family or community that they have struggled to accept."
