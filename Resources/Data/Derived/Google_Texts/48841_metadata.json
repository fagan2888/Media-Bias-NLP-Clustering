The team found that 12.6 percent of the visits resulted in the patient being prescribed benzodiazepines or opioids \u2014 in other words, sedatives or painkillers. The number of prescriptions for sedatives also increased 12.5 percent per year, Health Day reported.\n\nAdditionally, data showed that patients who received prescriptions for painkillers were four times more likely to receive a prescription for sedatives as well compared to patients who weren\u2019t prescribed opioids. The number of joint prescriptions also rose by 12 percent a year.\n\nA Growing Problem\n\nThe study dovetails with a study published earlier this month, in which officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed that a growing number of pill abusers get their drugs from doctors, friends, and family members rather than drug dealers or strangers. \"At this point, virtually everyone recognizes that this is a serious problem that has been getting much worse,\" Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, told The Los Angeles Times. \"What we now are figuring out is what\u2019s going to work to reverse it.\"\n\nThe rising rates of medication-related health problems have also been attributed to broader diagnostic guidelines issued by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) 5 \u2014 the de facto authority on psychiatric practice in the U.S. Prominent figures like former APA chairman Dr. Allen Frances have charged that, by turning the problems of everyday life into mental disorders, the manual is stoking a \u201cdiagnostic inflation.\u201d\n\n\"We have more deaths in emergency rooms now for prescribed psychiatric medication than we do for street drugs,\" he said in an interview with Newsweek.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "xanax, valium, sedatives, allen frances, american psychiatric association, lisa cosgrove, overprescribing drugs, opioid painkillers,", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Prescription of sedatives like Xanax, Valium, and Ativan has increased by more than 10 percent every year since 2002, a new study finds.", "title": "U.S. Doctors Are Prescribing More Xanax And Valium Than Ever Before", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/us-doctors-prescribing-more-xanax-valium-and-other-sedatives-ever-270844", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/09/pill.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Prescription of sedatives like Xanax, Valium, and Ativan has increased by more than 10 percent every year since 2002, a new study finds.", "title": "U.S. Doctors Are Prescribing More Xanax And Valium Than Ever Before", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/us-doctors-prescribing-more-xanax-valium-and-other-sedatives-ever-270844", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/09/pill.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/03/09/pill.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Drugs", "published_time": "2014-03-09T18:14:43-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-09T18:14:42-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Prescription of sedatives like Xanax, Valium, and Ativan has increased by more than 10 percent every year since 2002, a new study finds."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd3da\"", "article_summary": "Prescription of sedatives like Xanax, Valium, and Ativan has increased by more than 10 percent every year since 2002, a new study finds.\nNew research shows that American physicians are prescribing more sedatives than ever before, illuminating a possible factor by the rising rates of medication-related deaths and hospitalizations.\nThe number of prescriptions for sedatives also increased 12.5 percent per year, Health Day reported.\nThe team found that 12.6 percent of the visits resulted in the patient being prescribed benzodiazepines or opioids \u2014 in other words, sedatives or painkillers.\nAdditionally, data showed that patients who received prescriptions for painkillers were four times more likely to receive a prescription for sedatives as well compared to patients who weren\u2019t prescribed opioids."}
