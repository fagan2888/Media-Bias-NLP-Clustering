They used to play with building blocks in their grandparents\u2019 living room in Justin before disease took away Chrissy\u2019s use of her legs.\n\nAmanda, who is 4, looks like a younger version of Chrissy. She has the same short, extremely curly brown hair and golden-brown eyes.\n\nBut like most sisters, they\u2019re also quite different. Amanda is a little more headstrong and a \u201creal fighter,\u201d her grandfather Steve Grube says, but Chrissy is a good big sister and keeps her out of trouble. They play well together, and often say \u201cI love you\u201d or hug each other.\n\nChrissy\u2019s favorite thing to do is play with her Shopkins \u2014 tiny toy food items with personalities \u2014 and her Disney princess and Monster High dolls. She likes to pretend her dolls are out shopping and when they return home, their food begins to talk to them.\n\nAmanda likes to look at bugs, play with dolls and act silly. She\u2019ll often get things her older sister can\u2019t reach and bring them to her, and she encourages Chrissy when she\u2019s accomplished something physical.\n\nThey love each other like only sisters can.\n\nAnd they both suffer from giant axonal neuropathy, or GAN, a rare, terminal genetic disorder that takes away the ability to walk, grab, eat and, eventually, breathe. It usually results in an early death.\n\nAlthough the sisters share the same genetic mutation, every person is different, and every personality is different. Amanda doesn\u2019t limp like her sister once did \u2014 the first symptom Chrissy exhibited \u2014 but she does fall more often than expected. When Amanda runs, her toes drag and eventually she\u2019ll trip, said her grandfather, a retired Ponder police chief.\n\nAt 4 years old, Amanda can still climb, and she can still jump. She\u2019s trying to learn how to ride a tricycle, which her older sister couldn\u2019t do because her legs were too weak to push the pedals.\n\nBut by December 2011 \u2014 about two years after Chrissy\u2019s diagnosis \u2014 Amanda had lost reflexes in her legs just like Chrissy.\n\nDiagnosis\n\nIt took five months to get Amanda\u2019s diagnosis. Doctors sent her bloodwork for gene mapping at a lab in Germany, where scientists discovered markers similar to what had been found in her older sister\u2019s blood.\n\nBoth girls tested positive for the disease. First Chrissy, and then Amanda.\n\n\u201cMy genes had helped kill my reasons for living,\u201d said the girls\u2019 father, Steven Grube. \u201cI fell to my knees and cried for God to take me instead. I still wake crying after dreams where I\u2019m standing over their graves.\u201d\n\nChrissy knows her little sister suffers from the same disease that afflicts her. She grieves about what could happen down the road for her if no treatment is found.\n\nShe asks her daddy, \u201cDo I need to tell Amanda? Do I need to warn her?\u201d He\u2019ll respond, \u201cWell, would it help her? Would she feel any better?\u201d\n\nBut they haven\u2019t really talked to Amanda about it. She\u2019s just too young to understand.\n\n\u201cAmanda does express frustration when she gets tired or trips and falls,\u201d said her mother, Katherine. \u201cShe\u2019s starting to realize that something is wrong with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, all you can do is treat the symptoms with physical therapy, try to keep their muscles strong,\u201d said Steve.\n\n\u201c[The disease] is going pretty fast,\u201d said Patsy Grube, the girls\u2019 grandmother. \u201cYou\u2019ll think she\u2019s kind of stable for a while, and you\u2019ll go, \u2018OK, we can deal with this.\u2019 And then it will \u2026\u201d She trailed off without finishing the sentence.\n\nLast December, Chrissy could still hold onto her walker in her leg braces and walk. But she can\u2019t do that now. She\u2019s not even using her braces anymore. Her family used to be able to help her stand up, and she could hold on and stand there while being undressed or going to the bathroom, but now her legs are too weak.\n\n\u201cI found pictures of her when she was Amanda\u2019s age,\u201d said her mother, \u201cand she was in dance and still in the early stages. It was before we knew that [the disease] would take her away from us. I still have hope for her, but just the last year, she could still stand. But now it takes two people to move her out of her [wheelchair].\u201d\n\nAmanda and Chrissy\u2019s parents are divorced. Steven, a pediatrician, is remarried and works for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Maryland. The couple bought a house next door to Chrissy\u2019s best friend. Katherine lives with her boyfriend in Maryland and alternates weekly care of the children with their father.\n\nEvery other week, Steve and Patsy travel 1,400 miles from Denton County to Maryland to help care for Chrissy and Amanda while their parents work.\n\nThe family often hosts cookouts in the backyard with Chrissy\u2019s best friend. They roast marshmallows and hot dogs.\n\n\u201cOur goal, and I think our son\u2019s goal, is for every day be a happy day,\u201d Patsy said. \u201cSo we\u2019re always upbeat and cheerful. It\u2019s kind of hard because sometimes kids will stare or are kind of afraid.\n\n\u201cBut mentally, she\u2019s in the fourth grade,\u201d Patsy said of Chrissy. \u201cShe reads like crazy. She\u2019s smart. She knows things. It\u2019s sad to see her cry because she can\u2019t run and play.\u201d\n\nIn the mornings, Chrissy gets up and takes a breathing treatment. She must now use a wheelchair, and she wears a body brace to keep her spine from curving. She can still sit up by herself, but she\u2019s lost her fine motor skills.\n\n\u201cIt just went like that,\u201d said Patsy, shaking her head.\n\n\u201cIf only [God] would let me trade places with them and take their suffering onto myself,\u201d said their father, Steven. \u201cOf course, he\u2019s not answered my prayers, and daily I watch the sweetest children ever placed on this earth struggle just to live the best lives they can.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the feeling as a parent that your genes caused the pain your children are forced to endure, and you are powerless to ease their suffering except in the most superficial ways.\u201d\n\nFinding hope\n\nNot long after their diagnoses, Steven took the girls to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore because he realized it is equipped to help them. One of the world\u2019s leading experts on giant axonal neuropathy, Dr. Thomas Crawford, works at the hospital.\n\nIt was also close to the National Institutes of Health, which will run a clinical trial for a new gene delivery drug as soon as researchers get final approval to move forward with human testing. They hope the treatment can halt the disease\u2019s progression.\n\n\u201cThe only hope my girls have for life are experimental genetic therapies whose true safety and effectiveness we will never know until it\u2019s inside their body,\u201d said Steven. \u201cIt\u2019s the only hope there is, and yet it terrifies me that the very thing that could cure them could also kill them.\u201d\n\nThrough the charity Hannah\u2019s Hope Fund, the family also learned about another researcher, Dr. Steven Gray of the University of North Carolina, who is developing a new gene-delivery treatment at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nKatherine found Hannah\u2019s Hope online when the family was still waiting on Chrissy\u2019s test results. In 2011, Steve and Patsy flew to New York after their granddaughter\u2019s diagnosis to meet charity founders Lori and Matt Sames. They wanted to learn more about GAN and what they could do to help Chrissy and Amanda, as well as other children suffering from the disease, by starting a nonprofit to raise money and awareness.\n\nThe Sameses founded Hannah\u2019s Hope after their youngest daughter, Hannah, was diagnosed with GAN. The nonprofit\u2019s mission is to raise funds for treatment and eventual cure of the deadly disease.\n\nAt the time of their daughter\u2019s diagnosis, Lori had found only one scientist in the world, Dr. Pascale Bomont in France, actively studying GAN. But then parents of other children who suffered from GAN began to contact her and Matt.\n\nSteve and Patsy met Matt Sames at a restaurant. When he got out of the car, they embraced and wept. They spent several hours discussing Hannah, GAN and the research Gray was conducting.\n\nThe next morning, Steve and Patsy went to Matt and Lori\u2019s home. They were taken to the basement \u2014 referred to as the \u201cwar room\u201d \u2014 where a huge wall poster mapped out their grassroots plan to contact people about GAN and listed events they could hold like fun runs, bike races and pancake breakfasts to raise funds for Gray\u2019s research.\n\nSteve and Patsy also met Hannah, who is about the same age as Chrissy. She was not as extroverted as Chrissy, who is very talkative, even with strangers, often telling other children with disabilities that she feels for them.\n\nHannah had tight, curly brown hair \u2014 extremely kinky hair is a characteristic of GAN \u2014 and golden-brown eyes like Chrissy. But she could still walk and move her toes. She felt comfortable around the strangers from Texas and even crawled into Steve\u2019s lap while they visited.\n\n\u201cIt was like looking at Chrissy in the mirror,\u201d Steve said.\n\nMatt and Lori suggested they organize their own charity so that donated money would be tax-deductible. They agreed. They created Fight for Chrissy and gained approval from the IRS as a nonprofit organization in about six weeks.\n\n\u201cThat was a miracle,\u201d said Steve.\n\nSome of the money Steve and Patsy raise goes to Hannah\u2019s Hope to help with research for a cure. Some goes to kids who suffer from GAN and might need things such as walkers, wheelchairs and ramps. They also need a van with a wheelchair ramp for Chrissy.\n\nMatt and Lori also told the Grubes about the Hope and Love Ball that Hannah\u2019s Hope holds each February, raising more than $100,000 each year for research. More funding will allow doctors to make any new treatment available to all children suffering from GAN.\n\nIn 2012, Steve, Patsy and Steven took Chrissy and Amanda to the ball, where the girls met Hannah for the first time.\n\n\u201cIt was amazing for these kids to be able to relate to each other,\u201d said Steve. \u201cSeeing someone with the same disease seemed to help them both.\u201d\n\nA possible cure\n\nToday, scientists at the Gene Therapy Center at the University of North Carolina are working with Hannah\u2019s Hope to create a investigational new drug to treat GAN, and they\u2019re hoping to begin Phase 1 of the trial later this year.\n\nThey hope the gene-delivery treatment rescues the nerves by delivering a healthy copy of the GAN gene, according to the Hannah\u2019s Hope website. The \u201cviral vector delivery truck\u201d that scientists are using is adeno-associated virus serotype 9. It\u2019s a one-time injection, and they\u2019re currently researching longevity studies to assess whether a subsequent injection is needed.\n\nOn Jan. 26, 2012, Gray and his scientists held a pre-investigational new drug meeting with the Food and Drug Administration, which guided them toward their clinical trials.\n\n\u201cSteve [Gray] brings the human component to the research,\u201d said Lori Sames when introducing him at the Hannah\u2019s Hope ball in 2011.\n\nGray said that when the Sameses first approached him in 2009, they asked for something that no one else had done: to treat the entire spinal cord and replace a gene.\n\n\u201cPeople had been trying to treat ALS with millions and millions of dollars invested,\u201d he told attendees at the ball. GAN is sometimes referred to as the children\u2019s version of ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nBut in a short time, with the resources that Hannah\u2019s Hope was able to provide, researchers now have what they think is a therapy for GAN.\n\n\u201cThis has been the most inspiring work I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Gray said. \u201cThis gives me the drive and a passion that I haven\u2019t felt before.\u201d\n\nBut gaining approval from the FDA has been a long, hard road.\n\n\u201cTime is definitely critical,\u201d said Lori. \u201cThe regulatory process, it\u2019s inflated. There\u2019s no urgency.\u201d\n\nIn October 2013, Gray and his team were ready to move forward with the gene delivery. They just needed final approval, and then came the federal government shutdown because of a funding gap created when Congress failed to agree to an appropriations continuing resolution because lawmakers were battling over the Affordable Care Act.\n\nChrissy and Amanda\u2019s family was beyond frustration.\n\n\u201cWe were so close,\u201d said Katherine, who continues to watch her daughters progressively get worse with each passing month. \u201cSome of this loss could have been reverted if they hadn\u2019t shut down. But I can\u2019t focus on that. I still have hope they will have a full life ahead and, more importantly, they can have a life.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 9 Gray and his team held a conference call with regulators, and they\u2019re hoping to get the go-ahead in the next couple of weeks.\n\nChrissy and Amanda\u2019s father, Steven, had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with Gray and learn more about the science behind the research and the gene therapy treatment, which involves a three-year trial. He realized they don\u2019t have a lot of candidates in the appropriate age range for the gene delivery. Gray wants to use the oldest children suffering from GAN because they need to be aware of what\u2019s happening.\n\nBut the older they are, the sicker they are, which makes it hard to track down patients who fit the criteria of the clinical trial. One young woman they had hoped could be part of the clinical trial died of pneumonia in early 2013. She was 21 years old.\n\nSteven has been taking his daughters to the National Institutes of Health and introducing them to the medical teams there. He hopes it will make them more comfortable if the time ever comes for them to receive the gene delivery.\n\n\u201cChrissy knows that the outcomes of these tests and the trials that follow determine whether or not she lives,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people get their heroes from books or movies. My heroes are my children. I can only hope to one day be worthy of the love they show me.\u201d\n\nIn February 2013, Gray gave a speech about his team\u2019s research at the Hannah\u2019s Hope ball. During his speech, Chrissy spoke out loudly, \u201cThank you, Dr. Gray.\u201d\n\nThe room went silent.\n\nCHRISTIAN McPHATE can be reached at 940-566-6878 and on Twitter at @writerontheedge.\n\nON THE WEB\n\nFor more information about giant axonal neuropathy or to make a donation, visit http://fightforchrissy.com or www.hannahshopefund.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nine-year-old Chrissy loves her little sister, Amanda.
