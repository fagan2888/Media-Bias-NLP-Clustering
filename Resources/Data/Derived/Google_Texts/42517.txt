Two House Republicans introduced legislation on Tuesday that would eliminate all U.S. taxpayer subsidies for foreign diplomats who work in the United States and buy health insurance under Obamacare.

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce (R-Calif.) and House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) proposed the No Healthcare Subsidies for Foreign Diplomats Act. It’s a continuation of their work from last year, when they were asking the Obama administration if reports were true that U.S. taxpayers are helping diplomats foot the bill for their insurance.

The legislation found that Obamacare allows subsidies to buy insurance, and lets diplomats of foreign governments use these subsidies, even though they don’t pay taxes in the United States.

“The Department of State has notified foreign missions in the United States, permanent missions to the United Nations, and the United Nations Secretariat that ‘the benefits of the United States Affordable Care Act are available’ to their personnel,” the bill stated.

It also said that while these subsidies are allowed, no one in the federal government seems to have any information on which diplomats are getting these benefits, or how many.

As a result, the legislation would make these diplomats ineligible for subsidies, and would require the government to certify that no subsidies are being handed out.

“After a year-long investigation, the Obama Administration finally came clean about the fact that foreign diplomats are eligible for taxpayer-funded health care subsidies,” Royce said. “This is unacceptable. Americans’ tax dollars should not be used to foot the bill for foreign diplomats’ health care coverage.”

“American taxpayers should not pick up the tab for foreigners on Obamacare,” Ryan added.
