IUCNweb, CC BY 2.0\n\nThe brain-eating amoeba, Naegleria fowleri, has infiltrated the water system of the St. Bernard Parish, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health officials. The rare but deadly parasite has already claimed two of its three victims\u2019 lives this summer, one of whom was playing on a water slide when he became infected five miles outside of New Orleans.\n\nThe CDC, along with the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals (DHH), filtered hundreds of liters of water from hydrants and faucets in order to capture any amoeba. Water samples from the Violet and Arabi areas of St. Bernard tested positive for the parasite, The Times-Picayune reported.\n\n\u201cWhile the water is safe to drink, there is a risk if the amoeba enters the nose,\u201d State Health Officer Jimmy Guidry told the Times. \u201cThere are basic precautions that families can take \u2014 such as chlorinating their pools and avoiding getting water in their noses \u2014 to protect, though infection from this amoeba is very rare.\u201d\n\nNaegleria fowleri causes infection when it enters deep into the body through a person\u2019s nose \u2014 if ingested, stomach acid will kill the microorganism. Once it enters deep into the nose via a strong force of water, it travels up the olfactory nerve until it reaches the brain where it begins to destroy brain tissue, with symptoms often appearing one to seven days later.\n\n\u201cIf you take a bath, do not put your head under the water completely,\u201d Dr. Raoult Ratard, an epidemiologist for the state, told the Times. \u201cIf you take a shower and you put the shower head right up your nose, that\u2019s not a good idea \u2014 but nobody does that \u2026 I take a shower every day and I never have water going all the way up to the ceiling of the nose. The water has to go all the way up, and you can feel it, because it burns if water goes way, way up there.\u201d\n\nThe DHH has been flushing St. Bernard\u2019s water system with chlorine and other chemicals since last week, and plans to continue to do so for several weeks. \"DHH is working with parish officials to provide assistance and support to the parish's staff to ensure that chlorine levels are being monitored daily,\u201d Assistant Secretary for Public Health J.T. Lane said.\n\nOther Brain-Eating Amoeba Cases\n\nOver 120 people have suffered from primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), the infection caused when the amoeba enters the brain, since cases were first reported in 1962. Only three have survived. Of the 32 cases between 2001 and 2010, 30 were from amoeba found in recreational water and two were from the water supply. The two who became infected from the water supply were flushing out their noses with a neti pot.\n\nAlmost a week ago, a four-year-old boy playing on a water slide at a home in St. Bernard became infected and died soon after. \u201cThey believe it was contracted with the slip \u2018n slide being out in the mud and the water for over a 12- or 14-hour period, in very hot conditions,\u201d St. Bernard Parish President David Peralta said, according to CBS News.\n\nNaegleria fowleri is most often found in southern states, in warm to hot water, buried in the sediment at the bottom of lakes and rivers. The microorganism can also be found in geothermal water (hot springs), swimming pools that are poorly maintained, water heaters, and soil, according to the CDC.\n\nThe only survival story of this year, and the third ever to be recorded, is that of 12-year-old Kali Hardig, who became infected while at a lake-based water park in Arkansas. Because her mother quickly took her to the hospital, doctors were able to induce a coma, lower her body temperature, and administer a German breast cancer drug, miltefosine, not yet approved in the U.S., which has been shown to kill the brain-eating amoeba.\n\nFor 12-year-old, Zachary Reyna, who was the second victim this summer, administration of the drug didn\u2019t help, and he died soon after doctors found he had no brain activity. He became infected after playing in a water-filled ditch near his home in LaBelle, Florida.\n\nPreventing Infection from Brain-Eating Amoeba\n\nLouisiana health officials compiled a list of precautions that residents of affected areas can take:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "st. bernard water supply, brain eating amoeba, ameba, primary amebic meningoencephalitis, louisiana", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The rare brain-eating parasite Naegleria fowleri was confirmed in the water system of St. Bernard Parish, just outside of New Orleans, less than a week after a boy in the area died from infection.", "title": "Brain-Eating Amoeba Found In Louisiana Parish Water System [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brain-eating-amoeba-found-st-bernard-parish-water-supply-after-boy-dies-infection-video-256761", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/14/drinking-water.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The rare brain-eating parasite Naegleria fowleri was confirmed in the water system of St. Bernard Parish, just outside of New Orleans, less than a week after a boy in the area died from infection.", "title": "Brain-Eating Amoeba Found In Louisiana Parish Water System [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/brain-eating-amoeba-found-st-bernard-parish-water-supply-after-boy-dies-infection-video-256761", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/14/drinking-water.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/14/drinking-water.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-09-14T14:07:44-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-14T14:07:43-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The rare brain-eating parasite Naegleria fowleri was confirmed in the water system of St. Bernard Parish, just outside of New Orleans, less than a week after a boy in the area died from infection."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd40e8\"", "article_summary": "Other Brain-Eating Amoeba CasesOver 120 people have suffered from primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), the infection caused when the amoeba enters the brain, since cases were first reported in 1962.\nIUCNweb, CC BY 2.0The brain-eating amoeba, Naegleria fowleri, has infiltrated the water system of the St. Bernard Parish, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health officials.\nPreventing Infection from Brain-Eating AmoebaLouisiana health officials compiled a list of precautions that residents of affected areas can take:\n\u201cWhile the water is safe to drink, there is a risk if the amoeba enters the nose,\u201d State Health Officer Jimmy Guidry told the Times.\nOf the 32 cases between 2001 and 2010, 30 were from amoeba found in recreational water and two were from the water supply."}
