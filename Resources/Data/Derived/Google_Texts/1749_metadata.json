This action permits DOI to oversee day-to-day operations of the nonprofit health insurance company to protect consumers and providers.\n\nFranklin Circuit Judge Phillip J. Shepherd signed the order this afternoon.\n\nKYHC previously announced it would not be participating in the 2016 open enrollment on kynect, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange, and said it had decided to complete a voluntary runoff of its business.\n\nKYHC members have coverage through Dec. 31, 2015, but should contact an agent or shop on kynect for new coverage to begin Jan. 1, 2016. To have replacement coverage by Jan. 1, 2016, a consumer must purchase a plan by Dec. 15, 2015. Open enrollment begins Nov. 1, 2015, and runs through Jan. 31, 2016.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s action placing KYHC into formal rehabilitation was necessary to ensure DOI is in a position to protect consumers and providers,\u201d said Kentucky Insurance Commissioner Sharon P. Clark. \u201cOur central concerns are making certain policyholders receive the services to which they are entitled, and that the providers offering those services honor existing contracts and receive payment.\u201d\n\nOnce a company is placed in rehabilitation, the Department of Insurance takes control of the company and handles the day-to-day operations. The state assumes no liability throughout this process because DOI works to preserve the estate\u2019s resources to pay for all expenses to the benefit of consumers and providers.\n\nKYHC policyholders and providers with complaints or other issues related to the rehabilitation action should contact DOI at 800-595-6053.\n\nClark said the cooperative played an important role in Kentucky\u2019s implementation of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cThe cooperative offered another option for many Kentuckians and the market is in a better place today \u2013 with more competition and choices \u2013 in large part because of the Kentucky Health Cooperative,\u201d she said.\n\nWith the number of insurers at a nearly two decade high, consumers may find more options and better coverage by shopping on kynect during the upcoming open enrollment.\n\nDepending on the county where an individual lives, kynect enrollees could choose from as many as seven insurance companies with expanded provider networks offering a total of 86 private health insurance plans. The insurance carriers for 2016 are Aetna, Anthem, Baptist Health, CareSource, Humana, UnitedHealthcare and WellCare. Two insurers, Anthem and UnitedHealthcare of Kentucky, will offer plans to residents in all 120 Kentucky counties.\n\nTo learn more about affordable health care options, visit https://kynect.ky.gov or call 855-4kynect (459-6328).", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "article_summary": "The Kentucky Department of Insurance (DOI), with the cooperation of the Kentucky Health Cooperative (KYHC), today filed a petition to place KYHC into rehabilitation.\nThis action permits DOI to oversee day-to-day operations of the nonprofit health insurance company to protect consumers and providers.\n\u201cThe cooperative offered another option for many Kentuckians and the market is in a better place today \u2013 with more competition and choices \u2013 in large part because of the Kentucky Health Cooperative,\u201d she said.\n\u201cToday\u2019s action placing KYHC into formal rehabilitation was necessary to ensure DOI is in a position to protect consumers and providers,\u201d said Kentucky Insurance Commissioner Sharon P.
