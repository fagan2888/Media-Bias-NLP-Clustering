Marco Rubio says that\u2019s a valid question, even as he thinks most of the border children should not stay.\n\n\u201cThese issues of migration are very difficult because they involve in many cases very compelling stories,\u201d the Republican son of Cuban immigrants said in an interview with Florida reporters before Congress broke for the August recess. \u201cAnd that has to be balanced with the right of a sovereign country to control the flow by which people enter. It\u2019s a very complex issue. Of all the issues I\u2019ve faced in my years in both the Legislature and here, it poses probably the most wrenching humanitarian ones, because no matter what you set the number at or what you set the process up as, you know that there are going to be compelling stories that you\u2019re not going to be able to address.\u201d\n\nCubans gets privileged status under the decades-old Cuban Adjustment Act. It has caused resentment among other immigrant groups and led to abuses. Some Cubans obtain legal residency in the United States but then travel back and forth to their homeland. And there is a growing trend of Cubans avoiding the traditional entry through water (under the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy those who are apprehended before stepping on U.S. soil are returned) and going through Mexico.\n\nReuters recently reported that \u201cmore than 13,500 Cubans without the proper papers had tried to cross the southwestern U.S. border since Oct. 1, 2013, more than during all of the previous 12 months. The 12-month total was about 5,500 four years ago.\u201d They have a name: Dusty foot Cubans.\n\nSaid Rubio: \u201cI\u2019ve never criticized anyone who wants to go back to Cuba to visit a loved one, their mother is dying, their children are there. What I do think is that if you come to this country and say you are in exile, fleeing oppression and a year and day after you lived here you travel back to Cuba 20-30-40 times a year, it really undermines that argument. And other groups look at that and say, 'They\u2019re no different than we are, why are we treated differently?\u2019 That sort of travel puts at risk the status Cubans have so I\u2019ve always been open to re-examining that given changes in migratory patterns.\u201d\n\nBut Rubio concedes he has no plan. He talked about making changes during last year\u2019s immigration debate but did not seek to insert provisions in the sweeping bill he helped write.\n\nIn the interview, Rubio also explained why he\u2019s called to end the deferred action program President Barack Obama began in 2012 to grant legal status to some children of illegal immigrants. Rubio, who has backed off calls for comprehensive immigration reform, is sending a mixed message as he was working on legislation with a similar aim but never produced a bill.\n\nHe says one complication was the possibility it would encourage people to come illegally, though Obama\u2019s policy applies only to those who arrived before 2007 and came to the United States before their 16th birthday, among other restrictions. More than 640,000 \u201cDreamers\u201d have applied under the program, including 27,000 from Florida.\n\n\u201cMy view is that after two years you haven\u2019t applied for (deferred action), you probably are not interested in the program,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSo it\u2019s important to send that message that that program is concluded and no new people are going to be allowed into it and, more importantly, that it\u2019s not going to be expanded to a new population of individuals because that will create the lure for more people to try to come.\u201d\n\nObama is considering expanding the idea to the broader population of immigrants. That would likely ignite a firestorm among Republicans in Washington who already accuse the president over overstepping his authority on a number of issues.\n\nWould that be the end of reform efforts on Capitol Hill?\n\n\u201cIt will certainly set it back even further,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI continue to support reform. How can anyone look at what we have today and say this thing works? How can anyone look at our immigration system and say, 'It\u2019s fine like it is, just do a better job of enforcement\u2019? I\u2019m sure some people have adopted that position, but the system doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Rubio now is calling for a piecemeal approach that starts with more enforcement.\n\nHouse Republicans recently voted to authorize a lawsuit against Obama on the executive power question. The suit focuses on his decision to delay an employer mandate under the Affordable Care Act. Republicans don\u2019t like the law anyway, so it\u2019s an odd situation. But the health care law remains a rallying point for activists.\n\nDo you support the suit?\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t read the lawsuit so I don\u2019t want to comment on the complaint. I\u2019d be endorsing all four corners of it,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI will say this: This president has increasingly become reckless in his use of executive power in ways that are counterproductive to the future of the country and unnecessarily divisive. It\u2019s really hard to believe that the state senator that gave that speech at the (Democratic) convention in 2004 about there not being a liberal America or a conservative America only a United States of America is the same person who is now president, who constantly seeks to divide us against each other. Part of that is the use of executive powers that I think have set back progress long-term on a bunch of issues, and immigration is one of them. I know that it\u2019s harder to do it by legislation and frustrating and longer, but when you go out and do these things by executive order you\u2019re taking one step forward and three steps back. You\u2019ve seen the way Obamacare has been selectively applied; that\u2019s been incredibly disruptive in the marketplace. The list goes on and on \u2026 That undermines the presidency.\n\nRubio, like other Republicans, has directed more attention lately to Senate Majority Harry Reid, D-Nev., blaming him for inaction and for not allowing amendments on legislation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how we can possibly move forward if you don\u2019t even allow other voices to be heard,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cPeople may say 'That\u2019s how the other side did it when they were in charge.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t here for that. And I hope that if we take the majority in November, Republicans will allow the Senate process to be respectful of all views. Because at the end of the day everyone who is here was elected to serve and represent the people who sent them here. They have a right to be heard, even if they don\u2019t have the votes to turn (ideas) into law.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Buried amid widespread calls that the young migrants flowing to the southern U.S. border be returned home is a question of fairness with a strong Florida connection: If Cubans who flee their country are welcomed, why shouldn\u2019t those escaping gang violence and drug trafficking?", "application-name": "Tampa Bay Times", "og": {"image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.tampabay.com/iwov-resources/images/og-default.png", "height": 600}, "site_name": "Tampa Bay Times", "description": "Buried amid widespread calls that the young migrants flowing to the southern U.S. border be returned home is a question of fairness with a strong Florida connection: If Cubans who flee their country are welcomed, why shouldn\u2019t those escaping gang violence and drug trafficking?", "title": "Sen.
