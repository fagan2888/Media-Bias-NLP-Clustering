I hit the wall. You know, as they say, you hit a wall every day and you just can't deal with it, I was there,\" Wissink said\n\nThe floodwaters have come and gone, but this small town business is just starting to pick up the pieces from the damage.\n\nWissink entered his business for the first time since the flooding on Wednesday, and even though the shop was in total disarray, he and his family have been working ever since to save what they can.\n\n\"We're doing this as a family. Everything we do is family,\" Wissink said.\n\nRelatives aren't the only ones helping out. Wissink says friends and even strangers have been volunteering to assist in the clean-up process. Even previous workers for Scotty's Paint and Body, like Todd Klosterbuer, are reaching out a helping hand.\n\n\"I've been going through the toolboxes, trying to clean out the toolbox and just get everything taken out so we can get it all cleaned up and everything,\" Klosterbuer said.\n\nCrews could also be seen sweeping mud out of the shop and cleaning equipment. Although it'll be awhile before his shop is up and running again, this business owner is staying optimistic.\n\n\"We're really happy for the support that everybody's had for us, and not just us, the whole town. I mean, this is one of the biggest disasters in my lifetime I've seen, we've got some pretty good people here in Rock Rapids,\" Wissink said.\n\nSomething Wissink couldn't be more thankful for.\n\nSome good news, Scotty's Paint and Auto Body did have flood insurance.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Rock Rapids, Iowa was one of the hardest hit towns from recent flooding this past week.
