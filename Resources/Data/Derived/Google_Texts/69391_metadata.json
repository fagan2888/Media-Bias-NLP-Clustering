According to Thursday\u2019s announcement, \u201csex\u201d will be defined to include gender identity, guaranteeing transgender people have the same access to health care as others. \u201cThis proposed approach is consistent,\u201d the rule reads, \u201cwith the principle that discrimination on the basis of sex includes discrimination on the basis of gender identity and that failure to treat individuals in accordance with their gender identity may constitute prohibited discrimination.\u201d\n\nThough \u201csexual orientation\u201d is not explicitly included in the regulation, \u201csex stereotyping\u201d is, which would extend protections to people who are gay, lesbian, and bisexual who might be discriminated against based on stereotypical notions of femininity or masculinity.\n\nAmong other things, this rule would prohibit insurance plans from categorically excluding coverage for transgender individuals just because of their gender identity. It would also protect transgender individuals\u2019 access to medically necessary health care services and ensure their gender is appropriately respected, particularly when placed in sex-segregated facilities like hospital wards.\n\nThe guidance recognizes that the protections \u201cmay be new.\u201d An example provided points out how some service providers may need to revise their policies to accommodate transgender patients: \u201cA provider specializing in gynecological services that previously declined to provide a medically necessary hysterectomy for a transgender man would have to revise its policy to perform the procedure on transgender individuals in the same manner it provides the procedure for other individuals.\u201d\n\nKellan Baker, Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress, told ThinkProgress that the protections are \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d and \u201can important addition to the canon of civil rights law.\u201d Noting how these protections will help all LGBT people, he highlighted \u201cthe historic step of banning insurance plan exclusions that target transgender people for denials of coverage.\u201d\n\nTen states and the District of Columbia had previously included such protections, but the proposed rule would extend the protections across the entire country. These protections have already helped people like Regina Gray, a Colorado transgender resident who almost had to sell her house because she had to pay out-of-pocket for most of her medication. Once the state marketplace opened, she was able to secure an affordable comprehensive plan that saved her over $700 a month.\n\nThe 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that transgender people have experienced rampant discrimination because of their identities:\n\n19 percent reported being refused medical care.\n\n50 percent had to teach their medical providers about transgender care.\n\n48 percent postponed accessing care when sick or injured because they could not afford it.\n\n28 percent postponed accessing care when sick or injured due to discrimination.\n\nSuch discrimination contributed to higher rates of negative health outcomes, including HIV infection, smoking, drug and alcohol use, and suicide attempts.\n\nThe passage of Obamacare has already increased the number of LGBT adults with access to health insurance, but many are still not covered.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "It'll finally be official: Obamacare protects transgender people from discrimination in healthcare.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "It'll finally be official: Obamacare protects transgender people from discrimination in healthcare.", "title": "New Obamacare Regulations Ensure Transgender People\u2019s Access To Health Care", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2015/09/03/3698345/obamacare-transgender-protections-2/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/03120704/We-Love-Obamacare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It'll finally be official: Obamacare protects transgender people from discrimination in healthcare.", "creator": "@ZackFord", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/03120704/We-Love-Obamacare-321x214.jpg", "title": "New Obamacare Regulations Ensure Transgender People\u2019s Access To Health Care", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-lgbt", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/03120704/We-Love-Obamacare.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/03120704/We-Love-Obamacare.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-03T12:30:48+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zackford"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "LGBT New Obamacare Regulations Ensure Transgender People\u2019s Access To Health Care CREDIT: AP Photo/Charles DharapakOn Thursday, the Department of Health and Human Services issued new proposed regulations on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act that would protect transgender people from discrimination in health care.\nAccording to Thursday\u2019s announcement, \u201csex\u201d will be defined to include gender identity, guaranteeing transgender people have the same access to health care as others.\nIt would also protect transgender individuals\u2019 access to medically necessary health care services and ensure their gender is appropriately respected, particularly when placed in sex-segregated facilities like hospital wards.\nThe 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that transgender people have experienced rampant discrimination because of their identities:19 percent reported being refused medical care.\nThe new rule refers to Obamacare Section 1557, which established nondiscrimination protections in health care on the basis of \u201csex\u201d for the first time."}
