Posted Monday through Friday right here at www.abcnews.com\n\nCompiled by ABC News' Carrie Halperin, Jayce Henderson, Will Cantine and Amanda VanAllen\n\nHEALTH CARE ABC News' Devin Dwyer, Gitika Ahuja and Steven Portnoy: \" Memo Reveals Only 6 People Signed Up For Obamacare On First Day\" Just six people successfully enrolled in health insurance plans through the new federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov, on the first day it went live, according to internal Obama administration \"notes\" released tonight by the House Oversight Committee. By the end of the second day, 248 people had enrolled, the documents show. The \"war room notes,\" prepared by the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight, offer the first rough snapshot of how many Americans were able to enroll on Oct. 1 and 2, reflecting all the technical snafus that plagued the site. LINK\n\nUSA Today's William M Welch: \" Memos Show Slow Start For Health Care Plans\" The federal government's new health care program got off to such a slow start that only six people successfully enrolled on its website the first day and only a few hundred had done so by the second day, documents released by Congress late Thursday show. The documents, released by the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee, state that just 248 people had succeeded in enrolling on the HealthCare.Gov site by the end of the second day, Oct. 2. LINK\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's Timothy W. Martin: \" Health-Site Flaw Put Navigators On Front Lines\" Christine Kaufmann and thousands of other people hired to help consumers sign up for health insurance on the new exchanges this fall knew they would be busy. But problems with the federally run website have placed these \"navigators\" on the front lines, facing a deluge of questions and resorting to pen-and-paper applications to enroll consumers. LINK\n\nThe Washington Times' Tom Howell Jr.: \" Some are in, some are out of Obamacare on Capitol Hill\" Members of Congress had to decide by Thursday which of their staffers would be kicked off their congressional health care plan and forced to buy coverage through the Obamacare exchanges, leading to a mishmash of legal strategies and recriminations on Capitol Hill. Under the provision, written by Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, during the health care debate, members of Congress and their office aides are supposed to be pushed to buy insurance in the state-based marketplaces, or exchanges, set up by the Affordable Care Act. LINK\n\nSYRIA The New York Times' Anne Barnard: \" Syria Destroys Chemical Sites, Inspectors Say\" Syria's ability to produce chemical weapons has been destroyed and its remaining toxic armaments secured, weapons inspectors said Thursday, as President Bashar al-Assad has offered unexpectedly robust cooperation, at least so far, with a Russian-United States accord to dismantle his arsenal. Elimination of Mr. Assad's manufacturing ability is the most significant milestone yet in a process that still faces a monumental task: destroying the government's 1,290 tons of declared chemical weapons in the midst of a bloody civil war that has killed well over 100,000 people and carved up control of the country. LINK\n\nHILLARY CLINTON The Washington Post's Philip Rucker: \" In the Clinton's talk of brokering compromise, an implicit rebuke of Obama years\" In recent stump speeches and policy remarks, Bill and Hillary Clinton have offered sharp criticisms of the partisan gridlock paralyzing Washington, signaling a potential 2016 campaign theme if Hillary Clinton chooses to run for president. The Clintons' critiques in recent days have been explicitly aimed at congressional Republicans, who helped spur a 16-day government shutdown and potential debt default in October. But their remarks also seem to contain an implicit rebuke of President Obama's failure to change Washington as he pledged when first running for the White House. LINK\n\nRAND PAUL Politico's Alexander Burns: \" Rand Paul pledges caution amid more borrowed language\" A top adviser to Sen. Rand Paul said Thursday night that the Kentucky Republican would be \"more cautious in presenting and attributing sources\" in the future, after POLITICO confronted the senator's office with fresh examples of Paul speeches that borrowed language from news reports without citing the original text. POLITICO contacted Paul's staff Thursday evening with multiple instances in which the popular conservative used language - either word-for-word or nearly verbatim - that had first appeared elsewhere. LINK\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENTS Bloomberg's Roger Runningen: \" Obama Makes Attracting Foreign Investment Target of U.S. Effort\" President Barack Obama is seeking to counter competition for investment from emerging economies by putting the federal government at the center of a coordinated campaign to bring new capital to the U.S. At a Commerce Department investment summit in Washington today, Obama outlined what the White House is calling an \"all hands on deck effort\" to attract investments and jobs from foreign companies, a job traditionally carried out by governors and mayors.
