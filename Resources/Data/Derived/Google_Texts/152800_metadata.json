Overall, state and federal governments are pouring more than $80 billion a year into the prison system with expectations of a continued payoff in terms of lower crime rates.\n\nRelated: State Prisons Break Away from Soaring Cost Trends\n\nBut a new study by the Pew Charitable Trust released on Friday indicates that states that continue to fill up their prisons are getting a diminished return on their investment, while states that have scaled back their incarceration rates actually are seeing greater reductions in their crime rates.\n\nThe five states that reduced their imprisonment rates the most between 1994 and 2012 \u2013 New York, New Jersey, California, Maryland and South Carolina \u2013 have seen their crime rates plummet by an average of 45 percent, according to the study. In contrast, the five states that increased their imprisonment rate the most \u2013 West Virginia, North Dakota, Idaho, Oregon and Wisconsin \u2013 have experienced an average reduction in their crime rates of 27 percent.\n\n\u201cDespite the conventional wisdom, states are showing that it is possible to cut incarceration rates without comprising public safety,\u201d Adam Gelb, director of Pew\u2019s Public Safety Performance Project, said in a statement. \u201cThe crime bill paid billions for new prisons but with nearly 1 in 100 American adults behind bars, we\u2019ve reached a point of diminishing returns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s now a broad bipartisan consensus behind alternatives for lower-level offenders that cost less and do a better job cutting recidivism.\u201d Gelb added.\n\nPrevention vs. Incarceration\n\nWhat\u2019s not included in the Pew study is information about preemptive crime prevention. All five states that saw the greatest reduction in crime while reducing incarceration rates had implemented the highly controversial \u201cstop-and-frisk\u201d policy in cities with high crime rates.\n\nStop and frisk was a by-product of the 1982 \u201cbroken windows theory\u201d of crime, developed by two social scientists. The idea was that a single broken window could lead to unbridled vandalism or worse unless the neighborhood is monitored and maintained. It was embraced by Mayor Rudy Giuliani in the early 1990s when crime in New York City was rampant.\n\nThe early and continued success of stop and frisk led other big cities to mirror the program. In 2011, the NYPD stopped almost 700,000 mostly black and Hispanic New Yorkers. But only 12 percent ended in an arrest or summons, The Atlantic reported. In the first half of 2014, the NYPD recorded a 92 percent drop in stop-and-frisk after the city\u2019s newly elected mayor de Blasio made a campaign promise to end the racial targeting.\n\nThe NY Daily News reported, \u201cThe sharp stop-and-frisk decline in 2014 came with a bump in the number of shooting victims, with 822 reported through Aug. 10 \u2014 an increase of 11.7 percent.\n\nThe 1990s Crime Wave\n\nThe national movement toward tougher and longer prison sentences was officially launched with passage of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Many lawmakers and state officials shocked by an epidemic of crack cocaine distribution and use focused on imprisoning convicted drug offenders and other dangerous criminal for longer periods.\n\nThe growing heroin epidemic in the U.S. could spark new enforcement measures. On Wednesday, federal agents and local police in Los Angeles uncovered over $65 million in laundered money from Mexican drug cartels. The cartels are going to want their money back, which usually means more kidnappings and ransoms paid. And let\u2019s not forget our breaking bad meth labs.\n\nOver the past 25 years, the Bureau of Prisons has seen a staggering 800 percent increase in its population, with more than 219,000 inmates behind bars \u2013 and almost half serving time for drug-related offenses. Almost a quarter of the world\u2019s prisoners \u2013 or 1.57 million individuals \u2013 are incarcerated in U.S. prisons, according to Justice Department data.\n\nRelated: Eric Holder Calls a Truce on the War on Drugs\n\nBut that is all changing. In light of the mounting cost of incarcerating and caring for prisoners - especially providing health care for an aging population \u2013 there has been an unmistakable shift away from a long-term policy of mass imprisonment.\n\nWith a sharp decline in the demand for crack cocaine and a reduction in trafficking, Attorney General Eric Holder last year called for a major curtailment of stiff federal penalties for drug convicts.\n\nMany factors besides longer prison sentences have contributed to the 40 percent decline in crime nationally between 1994 and 2012. There is evidence, for example, that putting more police on the streets and community oriented policing services in the mid-1990s deterred crime. If states couldn\u2019t afford that cost, they defaulted to incarceration, which also reduced crime. In addition to stop-and-frisk, a record peacetime expansion of the economy in the 1990s gave many an alternative to a life of crime.\n\nRelated: State Prisons Break Away from Soaring Cost Trends\n\n\u201cThe best we can say is that mass incarceration had a significant but not overwhelming impact on crime, accounting for perhaps 10 to 25 percent of the reduction,\u201d according to Richard Rosenfeld, a professor at the University of Missouri and one of eight scholars who advised Pew on its study.\n\nSteven Raphael, professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, told Pew, \u201cAs you increase the number of people you put behind bars, you dip into a population that is increasingly less criminally active, so the benefits of incarceration diminish.\u201d\n\nThe Pew study stressed that states have experienced varied results in cutting or raising their imprisonment rates. For example, while New York cut its imprisonment rate by 24 percent since 1994 and Florida has increased imprisonment by 31 percent, both states have seen the same reduction in the crime rate: 54 percent.\n\nEffective community policing could have allowed New York to cut their prison rate and save money on that end. But they added significantly to their police force in order to do it.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The huge surge in the U.S. incarceration rate since passage of a tough federal anti-drug and violent crime law in 1994 greatly added to state and federal operating budgets but led to a major reduction in serious crimes.
