Tri-anim will offer the plan, which includes Nonin's GO 2 \u00ae personal pulse oximeter, under its Curaplex\u00ae brand. Nonin made the announcement at the 2015 American Association for Respiratory Care (AARC) Congress in Tampa, Fla.\n\nThe Nonin COPD STEP Plan was developed by leading pulmonologists Brian Carlin, MD, and Brian Tiep, MD, and respiratory therapists Trina Limberg, RRT, MAACVPR, and Bob McCoy, RRT, FAARC. The plan is based on successful COPD treatment and management programs that these panel members already have in practice.\n\n\"Most hospitals have programs to treat the acute aspects of COPD, but post-discharge programs supporting the chronic disease aspects tend to fall short,\" said Nonin Medical Vice President of Sales, Rick Eagle. \"Nonin's COPD STEP Plan addresses both the acute treatment and chronic management aspects of the disease by providing a seamless transitional care plan from hospital to home to clinic.\"\n\n\"November is National COPD Awareness Month and Nonin's COPD STEP Plan is just the latest example of our shared commitment to providing value-added products and programs that reduce costs and make a positive impact on patient care,\" said Tri-anim Health Services Vice President of Marketing, Fred Hunter.\n\nNonin Medical's COPD STEP Plan includes a four-pillar approach:\n\nCare-team Alignment \u2013 Full alignment between hospital administration and clinical staff, a trained hospital COPD coordinator, coordination with the primary physician and full patient participation in care\n\n\u2013 Full alignment between hospital administration and clinical staff, a trained hospital COPD coordinator, coordination with the primary physician and full patient participation in care In-patient Hospital Care Plan \u2013 Accurate diagnosis and treatment, and in-patient training on home equipment and Daily Rituals using the \"teach back\" method\n\n\u2013 Accurate diagnosis and treatment, and in-patient training on home equipment and Daily Rituals using the \"teach back\" method Outpatient Home Care Plan \u2013 \"Daily Rituals\" activity plan, rapid access to the clinician for patients experiencing signs of exacerbation or relapse, and patient contact post discharge as needed to assurance plan and medication adherence\n\n\u2013 \"Daily Rituals\" activity plan, rapid access to the clinician for patients experiencing signs of exacerbation or relapse, and patient contact post discharge as needed to assurance plan and medication adherence Home-Care Devices \u2013 Home oxygen (including lightweight portable oxygen), a pulse oximeter, an airway clearance device and an MDI spacer, as needed\n\n\"We have learned that COPD can be better managed by using a patient-centered model that works across the care continuum,\" said Brian Carlin, MD, past president of American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR) and participant in a pilot project that reduced COPD 30-day readmissions from an average of 23% to 5% following intervention.1 \"This typically includes using a higher quality, accurate personal pulse oximeter at home to monitor blood oxygen saturation and heart rate.\"\n\nAccurate pulse oximeter readings, such as those provided by Nonin's GO 2 pulse oximeter, give patients the knowledge and confidence to be active, titrate their oxygen therapy under physician guidance and recognize the onset of an exacerbation.\n\nCOPD, a debilitating lung disease, is the third-leading cause of death worldwide with the prevalence increasing as baby boomers reach the prime age for disease manifestation.2 In the U.S., 20 percent of patients who are hospitalized for COPD flare-ups are re-admitted within 30 days3, representing a significant cost for most U.S. hospitals using the current care models. It is so significant, that the Affordable Care Act now financially penalizes facilities that exceed a predetermined threshold of readmissions within 30 days. In fiscal year 2015, more than 78 percent of U.S. hospitals were fined for their readmission performance related to COPD.4\n\nFor a free white paper and more information about the Nonin Medical COPD Step\u2122 Plan, visit Nonin booth #608 or Tri-anim booth #227 at the AARC Congress, Nov. 7-9, at the Tampa Convention Center.\n\nAbout Nonin Medical, Inc.\n\nNonin Medical, Inc. invented the finger pulse oximeter and is a leader in designing and manufacturing noninvasive medical monitoring solutions that meet customers' technology needs today and tomorrow.
