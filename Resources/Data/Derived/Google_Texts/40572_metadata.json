The R word \u2014 \u201cretarded\u201d \u2014 is being relegated to the trash can, just like the N word. A new national poll, commissioned by the Shriver Report, shows that nearly nine out of every 10 people consider \u201cretard\u201d as a boorish, cruel word that simply shouldn\u2019t be used.\n\nThe medical establishment agrees. The newest edition of the handbook of mental disorders replaces \u201cmental retardation\u201d with \u201cintellectual disability.\u201d Part of the credit for this increasing civility and acceptance goes to the Kennedy clan and their cause, the Special Olympics. Anyone who has attended a Special Olympics comes away moved by the dignity and perseverance of these athletes.\n\nYou\u2019ll get your chance this week to watch the World Summer Games, which launched Saturday in Los Angeles. This is the largest ever event of its kind, with 7,000 athletes from 177 countries (even our new best ally, Iran) competing in Olympic-style events including cycling, aquatics and weightlifting. The Special Olympics was started by Eunice Kennedy Shriver, who was saddened that her own disabled sister Rose had been shut away for life beginning at age 23.\n\nIn 1963, Rose\u2019s brother, President John F. Kennedy, called for a new approach, moving the mentally ill and intellectually disabled out of state hospitals into small group homes and their local communities. Though well-intentioned, it was an impractical idea for dealing with the severely mentally ill. Many released from state hospitals now languish in jail cells instead.\n\nBut deinstitutionalization has been a huge success for the intellectually disabled. Since Kennedy\u2019s time, there\u2019s been a 98 percent drop in children in state institutions. Now the intellectually disabled can live in more normal circumstances and acquire a measure of independence, instead of being warehoused behind locked doors.\n\nEven so, it\u2019s still a mixed picture for them and their families. Breaking into the workplace isn\u2019t easy. Only 34 percent of the intellectually disabled work, mostly in what are called \u201csheltered workshops\u201d that pay below minimum wage and still keep them apart from other employees. Advocates are pressuring state lawmakers to end these government-subsidized workshops and require employers to pay at least minimum wage.\n\nLooming ahead is the problem of who will take care of the intellectually disabled \u2014 including those with Down syndrome, autism and low IQs \u2014 when their parents or other caregivers die. Some 730,000 people with ID depend on a caregiver over age 60.\n\nConsidering these challenges, which can outlast a parent\u2019s own life, 67 percent of American women who find themselves pregnant with a Down-syndrome baby abort. That rate is even higher \u2014 a staggering 92 percent \u2014 in Europe. Behind these statistics are the emotionally wrenching decisions of prospective parents who can\u2019t imagine taking on this task.\n\nIn the United States, routine screening for Down syndrome began about a decade ago, and the resulting abortions have caused the American population with Down syndrome to plummet 30 percent since then. For parents who didn\u2019t make the decision to abort and are dealing with the daily challenges and triumphs of the condition, watching the Special Olympics will be especially joyful.\n\nThe Games show what\u2019s possible, and the courage and determination innate to all humans, regardless of their IQ.\n\nTake heed, ObamaCare architect Ezekiel Emanuel. He\u2019s argued that organ transplants and other scarce resources shouldn\u2019t go to the mentally disabled, who are \u201cirreversiblly prevented\u201d from contributing fully to society. Fortunately, 87 percent of Americans disagree with that cold calculation, according to the new national poll, and want the intellectually disabled to have access\n\nto organ transplants.\n\nIt\u2019s a sign that Americans are becoming ready to embrace the humanity of the intellectually disabled. One reason for that generosity of spirit will be evident when you tune into the Special Olympics. The games are doing a lot to remove the stigma from intellectual disability, though the race is far from won.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research and author of \u201cBeating Obamacare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "Good news.
