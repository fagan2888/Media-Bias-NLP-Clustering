Sam Brownback has said any proposal to expand Medicaid in Kansas must have a work requirement and be budget-neutral, but he will not sign any bill until Medicaid waiting lists for home and community-based services for Kansans with disabilities are eliminated.\n\nEileen Hawley, spokeswoman for Brownback, said in an email Wednesday that opposition to expanding Medicaid is rooted in problems with other aspects of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cExpanding Obamacare is politically toxic because it has been a tremendous failure. It has cut funding to rural hospitals, broken its promise to allow people to keep their current insurance plans, and caused dramatic increases in premiums,\u201d she said. \u201cObamacare is the problem. Expanding Obamacare does not solve the problem.\u201d\n\nThe ACA included a provision that would expand Medicaid to anyone earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line, which would be $33,465 annually for a family of four. It also would require states to raise Medicaid reimbursement rates, which could entice more providers to accept Medicaid patients.\n\n\u201cObamacare is the problem. Expanding Obamacare does not solve the problem.\u201d - Eileen Hawley, spokeswoman for Gov. Sam Brownback\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could opt out of expansion, and Kansas is one of 19 states that haven\u2019t expanded eligibility. Kansas adults are only eligible for Medicaid if they are parents, are pregnant or have a disability. Even so, the income threshold is 33 percent of the poverty line, or $8,002 annually for a family of four.\n\nThe ACA requires the federal government to fund 100 percent of the cost of expansion from 2014 to 2016. That percentage would begin to drop in 2017, reaching a low of 90 percent in 2020. Brownback and other Republicans have expressed skepticism the federal government will continue supplying its share indefinitely, however.\n\nThe Kansas Hospital Association\u2019s most recent attempt to move Medicaid expansion forward, known as \u201cBridge to a Healthy Kansas,\u201d would require recipients to pay something toward their health care costs and include a job training requirement. Federal officials have consistently rejected work requirements in waiver applications.\n\nThe Kansas Health Institute estimates that expansion initially would extend coverage to approximately 150,000 Kansas, including about 63,000 who are now uninsured. The health institute is the parent organization of the editorially independent KHI News Service.\n\nNichols said Kansas, like the United States as a whole, has become politically polarized in recent years, and anything linked to President Barack Obama will be unpopular in some communities. Finding common ground on an issue like Medicaid expansion requires building a coalition of doctors, hospitals, health insurers and large employers \u2014 a process that took four years in his home state of Arkansas, he said.\n\n\u201cWhat makes these conversations possible is trust,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people in every community that people trust.\u201d\n\nFrustration with the process frequently entered into discussions from a panel of stakeholders who took the stage after Nichols spoke. Terry Deschaine, a trustee at Sumner Regional Medical Center in Wellington, said he thinks the debate isn\u2019t likely to change unless the composition of the Legislature does first.\n\n\u201cWe have changed this legislation to meet every objection the Legislature has, and the Legislature still refuses to have that conversation,\u201d he said.\n\nSumner Regional Medical Center has been on a list of hospitals deemed at risk of closing for two years, Deschaine said. He estimated expanding Medicaid would raise the hospital\u2019s revenues by about $700,000 a year.\n\n\u201cMany of our residents are in that gap where they\u2019re working low-wage jobs\u201d and can\u2019t afford insurance, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re taking care of patients, and we aren\u2019t getting paid.\u201d\n\nThe nonprofit KHI News Service is an editorially independent initiative of the Kansas Health Institute and a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor reporting collaboration.
