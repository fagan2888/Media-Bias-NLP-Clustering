For the past six years, I've heard nothing from conservatives but despair and woe over the lawless perfidy of the Obama regime. The republic is falling \u2014 has fallen! The Constitution is in shreds! Liberty is a thing of the past! Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world! My alternative theory \u2014 that Obama is a hapless schmuck who can't see his own slapstick failures because he (one) suffers from Narcissistic Personality Disorder and (b) is protected by a corrupt news media \u2014 has been repeatedly shouted down as way too rosy. I'm a fool to think the president is merely a Bozo who has created a terrible mess that will take at least a decade to clean up \u2014 so conservatives tell me \u2014 when it's clear he's actually an Alinskyite super-genius Islamist sleeper agent who has masterfully undermined the very fabric of our democracy.\n\nSo okay, answer me this: If our republic is in such crisis because of Obama and his fellow travelers, why are conservatives currently launching vicious personal attacks against... other conservatives??? For the past week or so, I've been seeing our pundits \u2014 people I know, respect and like \u2014 saying the ugliest things imaginable about one another and about some of the Republican candidates. This is not a matter of disagreeing. We're freedom-loving Americans. We're supposed to disagree and argue our sides without fear or favor. But this is dark-alley-knife-fight crap. Disgraceful, low insults I wouldn't even hurl at... well, at a Democrat! I won't be specific. I won't call out these people I like and admire so much. But the folks who read PJM are politically savvy enough to know who and what I'm talking about \u2014 and so are the people slinging the mud.", "article_metadata": {"page-title": "Conservative Pundits Gone Wild | Klavan On The Culture", "pinterest": "nopin", "og": {"site_name": "Klavan On The Culture", "description": "Why are conservatives currently launching vicious personal attacks against ... other conservatives???", "title": "Conservative Pundits Gone Wild", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/andrewklavan/2015/8/19/conservative-pundits-gone-wild/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/26/files/2015/08/circular_firing_squad-1-1.jpg", "updated_time": 1464302657, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Why are conservatives currently launching vicious personal attacks against ... other conservatives???", "title": "Conservative Pundits Gone Wild", "url": "https://pjmedia.com/andrewklavan/2015/8/19/conservative-pundits-gone-wild/", "image": "https://pajamasmed.hs.llnwd.net/e1/user-content/26/files/2015/08/circular_firing_squad-1-1.jpg", "site": "@PJMedia_com", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Conservative Pundits Gone Wild | Klavan On The Culture", "pinterestDescription": "Conservative Pundits Gone Wild", "fb": {"app_id": 149848758413844}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Conservative Pundits Gone WildThe mighty-yet-lovable Glenn Reynolds of Instapundit (and believe me, it's no small trick being both mighty and lovable, as I well know!)\nfrequently remarks about climate alarmists, \"I'll believe it's a crisis when they start acting like it's a crisis.\"\nFor the past six years, I've heard nothing from conservatives but despair and woe over the lawless perfidy of the Obama regime.\nWell, as far as I'm concerned, the same Insta-principle applies to conservatives.\nFor the past week or so, I've been seeing our pundits \u2014 people I know, respect and like \u2014 saying the ugliest things imaginable about one another and about some of the Republican candidates."}
