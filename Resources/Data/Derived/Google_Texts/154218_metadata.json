An NPR story took a look at geographical areas where people tend to drink more and demonstrate dependency. It also explored the differences between consumption for men and women as well as some other data points. It provided the charts below based on data published in the journal, Addiction.\n\nNPR examined not only the amount of alcohol consumed, but also provided an estimation of annual frequency.\n\nAlthough these numbers don\u2019t necessarily indicate whether or not certain populations are more prone to addiction, the study does illustrate how prominent dependence is around the world.\n\nWorldwide, some 5 percent of the world\u2019s population \u2014 about 240 million people \u2014 are dependent on alcohol. The accepted mental health definitions of dependence speaks of compulsive use, loss of control over substance use, and a failure to stop using even when people are aware of the problems alcohol is causing. More than a billion people, or 20 percent of the human race, smoke tobacco.\n\nSome insights from the report aren\u2019t necessarily surprising. Russians and Eastern Europeans smoke and drink the most, while Muslim countries, notsomuch \u2014 they tended to have much lower levels of dependence. In most areas of the world, women drink and smoke less than men. But that\u2019s generally the not the case in Western countries.\n\nWhile drinking and smoking is \u201cpredominantly a male behavior\u201d in some countries, lead author Dr. Linda Gowing, a professor at the University of Adelaide\u2019s School of Medical Sciences, said that\u2019s not the case in the West.\n\n\u201cWhat comes with women\u2019s liberation is the right to keep up with males, and that applies to addiction as well.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Flickr user Carlsberg Group", "article_metadata": {"description": "Alcohol, tobacco and drug dependency varies greatly in different parts of the world.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Alcohol, tobacco and drug dependency varies greatly in different parts of the world.", "title": "Where in the world is alcohol consumption highest and who more frequently battles addiction?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/5729897300_12cd6a91e8_z.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-01T11:10:45-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/06/in-what-areas-of-the-world-to-people-consume-the-most-alcohol-and-more-frequently-battle-addiction/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/5729897300_12cd6a91e8_z.jpg", "description": "Alcohol, tobacco and drug dependency varies greatly in different parts of the world.", "card": "summary", "title": "Where in the world is alcohol consumption highest and who more frequently battles addiction? - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,addiction, alcoholism, drug abuse, tobacco use, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "tobacco use", "published_time": "2015-06-01T09:46:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-01T11:10:45-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "In most areas of the world, women drink and smoke less than men.\nIt also explored the differences between consumption for men and women as well as some other data points.\nAlcohol consumption levels, tobacco and illegal drug use varies around the world.\nNPR examined not only the amount of alcohol consumed, but also provided an estimation of annual frequency.\nAlthough these numbers don\u2019t necessarily indicate whether or not certain populations are more prone to addiction, the study does illustrate how prominent dependence is around the world."}
