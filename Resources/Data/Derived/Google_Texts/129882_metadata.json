The bill strengthens Missouri\u2019s existing Health Care Freedom Act by protecting Missourians and Missouri businesses from Obamacare insurance mandates. Specifically, the bill would require insurers to follow the Obamacare law as written and not accept federal subsidies. Those insurers who accept subsidies in violation of the law would have their license suspended by the state.\n\n\u201cMissourians spoke loudly against Obamacare with over 71 percent voting in favor of the Health Care Freedom Act in 2010 and a majority voting to not allow the Governor to establish a state exchange in 2012,\u201d said Senator-elect Onder. \u201cDuring the 2014 elections, citizens of the 2nd Senatorial district in St. Charles County identified the continued fight against the implementation of Obamacare as a top priority. I believe this bill is yet another step in that direction.\u201d\n\nIn addition to today\u2019s filing, Senator-elect Onder intends to introduce other legislative priorities for the 2015 session during the prefiling period.\n\nThe 2015 legislative session begins on January 7. New legislation can be filed through February 26, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Missouri Times", "description": "PRESS RELEASE December 1, 2014 For Immediate Release Contact: Dr. Bob Onder (636) 561-8968 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Senator-Elect Bob Onder Prefiles Legislation for the 2015 Legislative Session \u00a0 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE \u00a0 JEFFERSON CITY \u2013 \u00a0Senator-elect Bob Onder prefiled the first bill of his 2015 legislative package today. \u00a0The bill strengthens Missouri\u2019s existing Health Care...", "title": "Press Release: Senator-Elect Bob Onder Prefiles Legislation for the 2015 Legislative Session", "locale": "en_US", "url": "http://themissouritimes.com/15154/press-release-senator-elect-bob-onder-prefiles-legislation-2015-legislative-session/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mo.times.14", "section": "Press Release - Government", "published_time": "2014-12-02T08:26:19-05:00"}, "generator": "Seriously Simple Podcasting 1.14.3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "JEFFERSON CITY \u2013 Senator-elect Bob Onder prefiled the first bill of his 2015 legislative package today.\nThe 2015 legislative session begins on January 7.\nI believe this bill is yet another step in that direction.\u201dIn addition to today\u2019s filing, Senator-elect Onder intends to introduce other legislative priorities for the 2015 session during the prefiling period.\nSpecifically, the bill would require insurers to follow the Obamacare law as written and not accept federal subsidies.\nThe bill strengthens Missouri\u2019s existing Health Care Freedom Act by protecting Missourians and Missouri businesses from Obamacare insurance mandates."}
