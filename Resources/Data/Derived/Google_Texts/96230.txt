Krauthammer: Obama's Latest Obamacare Push Is "Another Linguistics Sleight Of Hand"

CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER: Look, it's another linguistics sleight of hand here. The backend sounds like some, you know, obscure, curlicue in the process. It's the cash register! It's the point at which you make the purchase. And if you don't have correct information or any information you don't have a purchase, you don't have enrollment, you don't have a plan, you have a catastrophe. And everybody understands that.



I don't agree that the website issue is over. It's still a rolling issue. The cancellations and the other issues are just added upon it and they're going to get worse next year when you get the cancellations from the employers. But the web site's a catastrophe. What we heard Jay Carney say breezily today, what a million people went on the web site. Well, how many enrolled? Apparently that number is not obtainable. Either they know it and are suppressing it, which I suspect is probably true, or they have no way of knowing which tells you that this thing is a turkey.



After -- I mean, Amazon refreshes its best seller list every hour. I know because I check it every hour. Every hour. And these guys say we're going to have to wait a month until we'll be able to tell you how many enrolled? This thing is absolutely nonfunctional. And Obama -- I mean, it's sort of touching, the way he believes in the power of rhetoric, his rhetoric, in denying and trumping reality.



He can issue all the words he wants, but unless he fixes what's out there, people are experiencing the cancellations, experiencing the pauses. And if they show up on January 1 thinking they are enrolled in a plan, see a doctor and incur an expense and aren't, that's going to be the end for Obamacare.
