FILE - In this Dec. 20, 2013 file photo, members and supporters from a coalition of organizations supporting domestic workers, rally outside the Indian Consulate in New York where Devyani Khobragade, India's deputy consul general was believed to be staying after she was arrested and charged with lying on a visa form by stating she paid her housekeeper $4,500 a month when she actually was paying her under $3 per hour, less than half the minimum wage. The prosecution of Khobragade highlights a problem advocates say is all too common â€” workers for foreign governments who bring along the baggage of human trafficking to the U.S. Because of the complications surrounding immunity laws, many abuse cases often go unreported or uncharged, advocates say. Victims' claims often end up in civil court for that reason, they say. Bebeto Matthews/AP Photo
