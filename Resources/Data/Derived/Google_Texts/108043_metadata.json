Acupuncture is a key component of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and as such, has been practiced in Asian countries for thousands of years. Worldwide, it has grown in popularity over the past few decades. When do Americans turn to acupuncture for effective treatment?\n\n\u201cMostly what I treat is pain,\u201d said Enrico Viselli, a licensed acupuncturist who practices in New York City and in Westchester, N.Y. \u201cI do a lot of orthopedic work, because insurance covers it, but I have treated health problems as diverse as infertility and Meniere's syndrome.\u201d This disorder of the inner ear, for which there is no Western cure, causes vertigo \u2014 a sensation of spinning \u2014 along with hearing loss and ringing in the ear. \u201cI\u2019ve also used acupuncture to get a breach baby to flip over,\u201d Viselli told Medical Daily. \u201cGenerally it takes one treatment lasting about 15 minutes, and the baby just flops over.\u201d\n\nHelen K. Pyo, another licensed acupuncturist practicing in New York City, agrees that many of her patients come to her for pain treatment, especially in the areas of the back and neck. \u201cBut I treat many conditions,\u201d she said, having worked with a range of compliments, including those normally attended to by an OB-GYN. In particular, she says she specializes in Eastern Dermatology and the treatment of allergies. \u201cI combine acupuncture with herbal medication,\u201d Pyo told Medical Daily. She offers patients a special organic facial, which exfoliates, cleanses, and finally concludes with a special light therapy treatment.\n\nExplanation of the Effects\n\nGenerally, Americans visit acupuncturists for pain relief. According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM), back pain is the most commonly reported use, followed by joint pain, neck pain, and headache. How effective acupuncture is in treating these conditions has been long debated, and though some scientific studies of the issue have been done, most provide insufficient evidence. However, a few research projects offer some fascinating insights.\n\nA recent study, for instance, found acupuncture helped to alleviate side effects from chemotherapy. Yet fake acupuncture \u2014 when a practitioner simulated the procedure \u2014 also lessened patient\u2019s negative symptoms, and did so nearly as often as acupuncture. This placebo effect appears to be, in the words of the NCCAM, an \u201cemerging theme in acupuncture research.\u201d\n\nAll of which begs the question, exactly how does acupuncture work? A classical Chinese explanation would be this: Just like rivers flowing along the earth, channels of energy run along and through your body, and these meridians, as they are called, irrigate and nourish your tissues. An obstruction in the movement of these energy rivers is equivalent to a dam impeding the flow. Acupuncture needles, then, unblock obstructions and reestablish the regular flow through the meridians. A contemporary explanation of acupuncture\u2019s effectiveness would involve the underlying science: Needling at strategic points along the surface of the body stimulates the nervous system to release chemicals in the muscles, spinal cord, and brain, and in turn, this triggers the release of other chemicals and hormones, all of which affect the experience of pain.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of the Chinese medical system in ancient times was prevention,\u201d explained Viselli, who has taught at the Pacific College of Oriental Medicine and the Swedish Institute, both in New York. \u201cThe Chinese thought it was much easier to prevent disease as opposed to curing it.\u201d Explaining how the paradigm was opposite that of contemporary Western medicine, he says it made all the difference in the world. \u201cIt was an agrarian society, so a doctor would go to each farm and there the owner would say, \u2018I need everyone to be well so that we can harvest.\u2019 And the doctor would work with everyone and see how they were doing,\u201d Viselli told Medical Daily. \u201cChinese doctors were not paid to get you well, but paid to keep you healthy. If they did a good job, they\u2019d be invited back for the harvest feast.\u201d\n\nChanging Landscape\n\nIn its review of acupuncture, the World Health Organization said 80 percent of 129 countries surveyed now recognize the use of acupuncture. Worldwide, it is generally safe, and in the U.S., relatively few complications have been reported by patients treated by licensed practitioners. WHO also indicates acupuncture as an effective treatment for more than 50 medical problems and conditions, including addiction, arthritis, depression, dysentery, fatigue, fibromyalgia, insomnia, migraine, pain, pneumonia, sciatica, stress, tooth pain, and vomiting. The greatest champion of the needling practice, China accommodates acupuncture in addition to conventional medicine at every level of its health-care services, with public and private insurance covering both.\n\nWhile many American patients might want to try or routinely use acupuncture, it is generally considered a complementary medicine and so may not be covered under every insurance plan. Under Obamacare, this may change, though for now it is not entirely clear whether acupuncture is covered. As reported by PBS, section 2706 of the law states insurance companies \u201cshall not discriminate\u201d against any health provider with a state-recognized license.\n\nTo many people, this wording suggests alternative medicines, when offered by licensed practitioners, will be reimbursed going forward. \u201cSome insurance companies are giving it a wider berth,\u201d Viselli said. \u201cLike Blue Cross Blue Shield and Cigna. They are more actively using acupuncture as a medical treatment.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "acupuncture, needling in, sickness, symptoms, insurance", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Though commonly used to treat pain, acupuncture is considered by the World Health Organization to be an effective treatment for more than 50 health problems.", "title": "Which Conditions Can Acupuncture Treat Most Effectively?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/acupuncture-needling-which-symptoms-and-sickness-does-ancient-therapy-treat-most-effectively-296036", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/31/acupuncture.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Though commonly used to treat pain, acupuncture is considered by the World Health Organization to be an effective treatment for more than 50 health problems.", "title": "Which Conditions Can Acupuncture Treat Most Effectively?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/acupuncture-needling-which-symptoms-and-sickness-does-ancient-therapy-treat-most-effectively-296036", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/31/acupuncture.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/07/31/acupuncture.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-08-01T08:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-01T12:31:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Though commonly used to treat pain, acupuncture is considered by the World Health Organization to be an effective treatment for more than 50 health problems."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd24df\"", "article_summary": "Acupuncture is a key component of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and as such, has been practiced in Asian countries for thousands of years.\nThey are more actively using acupuncture as a medical treatment.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve also used acupuncture to get a breach baby to flip over,\u201d Viselli told Medical Daily.\nShe offers patients a special organic facial, which exfoliates, cleanses, and finally concludes with a special light therapy treatment.\nYet fake acupuncture \u2014 when a practitioner simulated the procedure \u2014 also lessened patient\u2019s negative symptoms, and did so nearly as often as acupuncture."}
