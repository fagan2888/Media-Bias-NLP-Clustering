In what is unlikely to go down as a high-water mark for broadcast journalism, Fox News linked the upcoming move to the ICD-10 coding system with the Affordable Care Act during a recent broadcast.

I guess they're starting to blame all problems in healthcare on "Obamacare."

The cable news channel ran a 3-minute segment on Friday about concerns arising from the planned Oct. 1 move to ICD-10.

The coding system -- the name is short for International Classification of Diseases, version 10 -- greatly expands the number and specificity of codes providers use to bill insurance companies. With the increased number of codes, physicians are concerned they will spend more time staring at a computer screen and looking up appropriate codes.

Fox News cut to a reporter in Chicago who spoke with a podiatrist -- not a physician -- who said she would go from seeing 30 to 40 patients a day under ICD-9 to 10 per day under ICD-10. I doubt the reporter pressed the podiatrist on that assertion.

Although the reporter didn't directly link ICD-10 to the ACA, the chyron at the bottom of the Fox News screen throughout much of the video reads "Concerns Over Rollout of New Obamacare Med Coding System."

Here's the problem. The move to ICD-10, which has already been delayed to give providers more time to adjust, has nothing to do with the ACA. "Obamacare" didn't bring this about or set this in motion.
