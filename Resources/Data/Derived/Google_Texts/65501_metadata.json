The Supreme Court on Thursday validated his signature healthcare law, guaranteeing he would accomplish a central second-term goal, to protect the 2010 Affordable Care Act from being dismantled by Republicans.\n\nThe icing on the cake came on Friday with the high court\u2019s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, a move Obama said was a \u201cbig step\u201d toward equality for Americans.\n\nAfter the court decision was announced, Obama took a Rose Garden victory lap.\n\n\u201cProgress on this journey often comes in small increments, sometimes two steps forward, one step back,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd then sometimes, there are days like this when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.\u201d\n\nSome Obama confidants described a more liberated, even feistier president, willing to mix it up with a heckler inside the White House, as he did on Wednesday. Or willing to use a racial epithet, long abandoned by civil society, to describe black people in urging more racial unity.\n\nWhy the change in style? He has more experience now, the president said in a podcast interview last week with comedian Marc Maron.\n\n\u201cPart of that fearlessness is because you\u2019ve screwed up enough times that it\u2019s all happened. I\u2019ve been through this, I\u2019ve screwed up. I\u2019ve been in the barrel tumbling down Niagara Falls and I emerged and I lived \u2026 That\u2019s such a liberating feeling,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018A LITTLE FREER\u2019\n\nNorman Eisen, a former White House counsel to Obama and former U.S. ambassador to the Czech Republic, said the president \u201cfeels a little freer now \u2026 to let his heart show publicly.\u201d\n\nEisen has known Obama for almost three decades and maintains that the president\u2019s \u201ccore is the same.\u201d But on subjects he cares deeply about, including race, Eisen said Obama is displaying more of his emotions.\n\nObama\u2019s speech on Friday in tribute to nine African-Americans killed by a white gunman in Charleston, S.C., was what the black community has wanted to hear from him for years.\n\nThis was not simply Obama as healer-in-chief, but a call to action from the president to end racial insensitivities.\n\n\u201cFor too long we were blind to the pain that the Confederate flag stirred in too many of our citizens,\u201d he said in a message aimed squarely at white Americans.\n\nSenator Dick Durbin got to know Obama well when the future president was elected to the Senate in 2004 and they both represented Illinois. Durbin was one of the first national\n\npoliticians to embrace Obama\u2019s 2008 White House campaign.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen a much more forceful president in the last few\n\nmonths on many issues,\u201d Durbin said in an interview, adding it was largely because Obama gave up trying to win over Republicans in Congress with his signature cool-headed reserve.\n\nExcept for bonding with Republicans on trade in recent weeks, \u201che\u2019s just had to try to devise ways to reach his goals without bipartisan support of Congress,\u201d Durbin said.\n\nRepublican lawmakers see things differently, describing a president they say refused to build personal relationships. Often, they said, they left White House meetings feeling as if they were lectured by a chief executive who just wanted to \u201ccheck off the box\u201d that he met with them.\n\nAnd he angered many of his Democratic allies too by forging ahead on the free-trade pact.\n\nWhere Obama goes from here is unclear. Negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program could result in a deal or could fall apart. Russian aggression against Ukraine continues, and the West\u2019s fight against Islamic extremism is uneven at best.\n\nHis long-desired bid for tax reform looks unlikely at this point as the country\u2019s attention turns to the campaign to find a successor to him in 2016.\n\nBut for one week at least, Obama had memories of achievements to last a lifetime.\n\n(Reporting by Richard Cowan, Roberta Rampton and Steve Holland; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh, Howard Goller and Stuart Grudgings)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/obama-singing-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Obama sheds cool style for \u2018fearless\u2019 final lap in office"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "article_summary": "With a year-and-a-half left in office, Obama is shedding some of his trademark \u201cno drama\u201d style for a looser approach, admitting that he feels more fearless and liberated.\nOften, they said, they left White House meetings feeling as if they were lectured by a chief executive who just wanted to \u201ccheck off the box\u201d that he met with them.\nDurbin was one of the first nationalpoliticians to embrace Obama\u2019s 2008 White House campaign.\nThis was not simply Obama as healer-in-chief, but a call to action from the president to end racial insensitivities.\nPresident Obama eulogizing Clementa Pinckney (Screenshot/Post and Courier)Barack Obama has reached the stage of his presidency where if he wants to break out in song publicly, as he did with \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d in a eulogy on Friday, then he\u2019s going to do it."}
