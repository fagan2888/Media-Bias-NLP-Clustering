Experiences in such regions \u201ccan be equally useful if you see changing [climate patterns] in the U.S.,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRisky Business,\u201d as the report released Tuesday by a bipartisan group of former U.S. cabinet officers, lawmakers and corporate leaders is called, estimates that higher average temperatures, rising sea levels and harsher weather events could cost U.S. companies tens of billions of dollars as storms deal harsher damage to coastal areas and hotter weather strains electrical grids.\n\nFor agriculture, where hospitable growing conditions and investments in infrastructure have made the U.S. a global leader, the effects could be severe if businesses don\u2019t respond, according to the report. A 10% drop in crop yields over the next five to 25 years is possible due to floods and droughts, according to the report, while the research showed that livestock production eventually could drop by 3% to 5% due to shifting weather, Mr. Page said.\n\nWhile the agriculture sector has made strides improving its environmental impact by reducing soil erosion and some chemical use, it remains in the environmental crosshairs of policymakers and activists. The White House earlier this year estimated that agriculture accounts for about 36% of human-related sources of methane produced in the U.S., with livestock by far the biggest source. Cargill, based in suburban Minneapolis, ranks among the biggest U.S. meatpackers.\n\nCargill, the largest privately held company in the U.S., doesn\u2019t have an official view on climate change, according to Mr. Page. But ignoring the possibility would be \u201ctoo arrogant,\u201d he said, adding that company officials have pondered how Cargill can draw on its own sprawling operations\u2013spanning 67 countries\u2013to prepare.\n\nOne example is in Thailand, where summer temperatures often top 100 degrees and where Cargill processes poultry, a business Mr. Page himself helped to launch in 1989. Ventilation systems and building designs used to keep birds cool in that country are now being looked at as Cargill remodels a pork-processing plant in Texas, Mr. Page said.\n\n\u201cWe think about whether we\u2019re designing a house for the weather today, or a house that might be highly efficient and effective at a more volatile temperature and humidity level,\u201d he said.\n\nWeather conditions in places like Indonesia, one of the many countries where Cargill buys corn to ship around the world, could provide a future blueprint for patches of the U.S., such as Missouri, which may become hotter and more humid if climate change persists, Mr. Page said.\n\nRaised about 17 miles from the U.S.-Canada border in Bottineau, N.D., Mr. Page said he personally observed the changing climate\u2019s effect on agriculture over the years as he returned to his hometown and noticed farmers there growing more corn, versus the wheat and barley that had dominated fields when he was growing up. Climate change, as well as hardier seeds enhanced by genetic engineering, have enabled farmers in cooler regions to broaden their range of crops.\n\nThe shift also has opened up new opportunities for Cargill. One of the company\u2019s biggest current capital investments is a canola-crushing plant in the Canadian province of Alberta, which the company has estimated will be able to process 850,000 metric tons of the oilseed each year.\n\n\u201cAs you travel, the evolution of certain forms of agriculture into higher and higher latitudes, it\u2019s become particularly pronounced, year after year,\u201d he said in an interview.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Agricultural conglomerate Cargill Inc. is banking on its global footprint to give it a leg up in blunting the impact of climate change.", "title": "Cargill Plans Tactical Approach to Climate Change, Executive Chairman Says", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/06/24/cargill-plans-tactical-approach-to-climate-change-executive-chairman-says/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Cargill Plans Tactical Approach to Climate Change, Executive Chairman Says", "description": "Agricultural conglomerate Cargill Inc. is banking on its global footprint to give it a leg up in blunting the impact of climate change.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Jacob Bunge", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "Agricultural conglomerate Cargill Inc. is banking on its global footprint to give it a leg up in blunting the impact of climate change.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-06-24T22:06:38-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/06/24/cargill-plans-tactical-approach-to-climate-change-executive-chairman-says/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-4952", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Agricultural conglomerate Cargill Inc. is banking on its global footprint to give it a leg up in blunting the impact of climate change.", "title": "Cargill Plans Tactical Approach to Climate Change, Executive Chairman Says", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/06/24/cargill-plans-tactical-approach-to-climate-change-executive-chairman-says/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-4952", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-24T22:06:38-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2f48\"", "article_summary": "Cargill, the largest privately held company in the U.S., doesn\u2019t have an official view on climate change, according to Mr.\nAgricultural conglomerate Cargill Inc. is banking on its global footprint to give it a leg up in blunting the impact of climate change.\nExperiences in such regions \u201ccan be equally useful if you see changing [climate patterns] in the U.S.,\u201d he said.\nOne example is in Thailand, where summer temperatures often top 100 degrees and where Cargill processes poultry, a business Mr.\nClimate change, as well as hardier seeds enhanced by genetic engineering, have enabled farmers in cooler regions to broaden their range of crops."}
