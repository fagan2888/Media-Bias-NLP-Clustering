Photo: Jacky Ghossein\n\nFor newsreader Peter Overton, life doesn't get any more magical than the daily ritual he shares with his six-year-old daughter Allegra - searching for fairies.\n\nThe Nine stalwart relishes their daily 20-minute walk to school.\n\nThe best thing in the world is being a father. I think it's given me much better perspective as a reporter and it's given me much better balance in life because, before I was a dad, I was very driven by work\n\n''We look for fairies in the gardens, and the other day I found one,'' says the man who has covered war zones, as he watches Allegra and her four-year-old sister Giselle play with their mother Jessica Rowe at a Rose Bay park.\n\n''I said, 'I think I saw something sparkling in the leaves.' Well, the excitement that gave her and, I'll be honest, gave me, too \u2026 Every day I think how lucky am I that, every day, at eight in the morning, we can hold hands and walk to school \u2026 and we can cover all the events in our little life.''\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOverton will be at work for Father's Day, which also happens to be the 22nd anniversary of the day he started at Nine as a junior sports reporter.\n\nAs with many dads across the nation, he will have started the morning with bad coffee and gifts from his daughters: a colourful painting, a bag of Darrell Lea chocolates and a mobile phone holder - made of matchsticks.\n\nRowe jokes her only complaint is her husband can't cook, but he is the ''most wonderful father'' to their girls.\n\n''He is caring, gentle and hilarious with them. He often puts on 'shows' for us, as the girls and I are not morning people and his antics get us laughing to face the day. I feel so blessed that we have him.''\n\nIt\u2019s clear Overton is in a good place.\n\nHis work life is on a high: \u2018\u2018I went into the [Nine News] chair in 2009, and we\u2019ve gone number one in 2011, 2012 and this year we haven\u2019t lost a week - it\u2019s been very rewarding and a great sense of accomplishment for everyone. They\u2019ve been loyal to me and I think I\u2019ve had the two best jobs in commercial TV - a 60 Minutes reporter full time for eight years and now reading the iconic Nine News.\u2019\u2019\n\nOverton and Rowe have a 'date night' most Thursday nights: ''The makeup girls on a Thursday night say \u2018Is it date night?\u2019 and I say, \u2018Yup, how do I look?\u2019,\u2019\u2019 he says.\n\n''The balance is an ongoing challenge because work is a demanding master. But Jess is very good at saying \u2018Come on, turn your phone off, this is us\u2019. And we\u2019ve nearly got the balance just about right in making sure the investment in your children is not sacrificed because of all the distractions and the intensity of life in 2013.\n\n''The best thing in the world is being a father. I think it's given me much better perspective as a reporter and it's given me much better balance in life because, before I was a dad, I was very driven by work,\u2019\u2019 he says.\n\nMaking children the priority, no matter how demanding work can be, is key.\n\n''So [on Friday] we had Father\u2019s Day at Allegra\u2019s school and it was wonderful for an hour and a half - before I went off to 60 Minutes - to be totally invested in her writing, making paper aeroplanes and just standing with other fathers and observing little girls running free and that wonderful sound, the best sound in the world of laughter. You know that kind where they don\u2019t have the other pressures they\u2019ll have when they grow up? And just this hour and a half window to spend with my daughter. All day that was my touchstone. Just thinking about it made me happy.\u2019\u2019\n\nAfter revealing there would be no more little Overtons, he says his role model is his 75-year-old father, who was a paediatric anaesthetist.\n\n''He worked his guts out. But no matter how hard he worked at the children's hospital, my greatest, greatest memories of dad are his investment in us four children. He'd come home tired, but he always embraced us and that\u2019s so important.\n\n''Allegra says to me all the time, \u2018Will you be late home tonight?\u2019 and sometimes you have to tell a white lie and they\u2019ll have to drift off to sleep but I\u2019ll work my guts out to get home.\n\n\u2018\u2019We love reading. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything better in this world than simply snuggling up to your child and reading them a book and hearing about their day.\u2019\u2019", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "National, Celebrity, Life", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "For newsreader Peter Overton, life doesn't get any more magical than the daily ritual he shares with his six-year-old daughter Allegra - searching for fairies.", "title": "Fairy hunt part of daily newsreel", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/celebrity/fairy-hunt-part-of-daily-newsreel-20130831-2sxf5.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/2/s/y/5/1/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.2sxf5.png/1377968400000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@LifestyleAU", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/2/s/y/5/1/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.2sxf5.png/1377968400000.jpg"}, "description": "For newsreader Peter Overton, life doesn't get any more magical than the daily ritual he shares with his six-year-old daughter Allegra - searching for fairies.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Fairy hunt part of daily newsreel"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "For newsreader Peter Overton, life doesn't get any more magical than the daily ritual he shares with his six-year-old daughter Allegra - searching for fairies."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc980f\"", "article_summary": "AdvertisementOverton will be at work for Father's Day, which also happens to be the 22nd anniversary of the day he started at Nine as a junior sports reporter.\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything better in this world than simply snuggling up to your child and reading them a book and hearing about their day.\u2019\u2019\nPhoto: Jacky GhosseinFor newsreader Peter Overton, life doesn't get any more magical than the daily ritual he shares with his six-year-old daughter Allegra - searching for fairies.\n''Best thing'': Peter Overton and Jessica Rowe with Giselle, 4, and Allegra, 6.\nHe often puts on 'shows' for us, as the girls and I are not morning people and his antics get us laughing to face the day."}
