Even as Obama immerses himself in talks on regional security, democracy building and business investment in Africa, the world\u2019s attention \u2014 and much of his own \u2014 will be on an extraordinary array of urgent overseas crises.\n\nAdditional Images President Barack Obama speaking at a business forum aimed at increasing investment in Africa, in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania in July, 2013.

An outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in West Africa also threatens to cast a shadow over the summit, with leaders from at least two affected countries canceling plans to travel to Washington and the U.S. setting up medical screenings for other officials arriving from those nations.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the nature of the world we live in today where there are multiple crises at any time,\u201d said Witney Schneidman, the former deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs. \u201cBut that should not paralyze us from moving forward on key areas to advance our interests.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials say the American interests in Africa are immense. The continent is home to some of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies and a rapidly expanding middle class. The U.S. is also competing for those consumers with China, which surpassed the United States in 2009 as Africa\u2019s largest trading partner.\n\n\u201cThe importance of this for America needs to be understood,\u201d Obama said Friday. \u201cAfrica is growing, and you\u2019ve got thriving markets and you\u2019ve got entrepreneurs and extraordinary talent among the people there.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cAfrica also happens to be one of the continents where America is most popular, and people feel a real affinity for our way of life.\u201d\n\nFrom the start of his presidency, Obama has faced sky-high expectations from African leaders and U.S. policymakers who hoped the son of a Kenyan would bump Africa up the White House list of foreign policy priorities.\n\nObama\u2019s first trip to sub-Saharan Africa as president \u2014 an overnight stop in Ghana in 2009 \u2014 also suggested that he could be an American president able to tell hard truths to the continent\u2019s leaders. During a speech to parliament in Accra, he declared that Africa \u201cdoesn\u2019t need strongmen, it needs strong institutions.\u201d\n\nBut it would be four years before Obama returned to Africa again, a yawning gap that raised questions about the extent of his commitment to continent. Unlike his predecessor George W. Bush, who launched a $15 billion program to address HIV and AIDS, Obama seemed to be lacking a signature Africa initiative. And his administration\u2019s focus turned instead to the Arab Spring movement sweeping through the Middle East, a heavily promoted rebalance toward Asia and a slew of pressing security concerns.\n\nAnalysts say Obama\u2019s second term has brought about a more robust focus on Africa. The president made a three-country trip to the continent last summer and aides say he\u2019s likely to travel there again before the end of his second term. He\u2019s also launched a new \u201cPower Africa\u201d initiative that aims to leverage billions in private sector commitments to bring electricity to 20 million households in sub-Saharan Africa. And he\u2019s launched a fellowship program for young African leaders that received more than 50,000 applications for 500 slots this year.\n\nCarl LeVan, a professor at American University\u2019s School of International Service, said those efforts, along with the Washington summit, suggest an administration undertaking \u201ca concerted and calculated effort to construct its legacy, and its legacy toward Africa in particular, since expectations were so high.\u201d\n\nAlso factoring into the U.S. focus on Africa: China, which has ramped up its investment in the natural resource-rich continent and whose leaders make frequent trips to the continent.\n\nU.S. officials try to draw a distinction between Chinese and American investment in Africa. While Beijing may spend more money, they argue that the Chinese focus more on extracting resources from Africa for their own purposes rather than boosting African capacity and building long-term economic relationships.\n\n\u201cWe do believe we bring something unique to the table,\u201d said Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser. \u201cWe are less focused on resources from Africa and more focused on deepening trade and investment relationships.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trade and economic relationships will be a primary focus of the conference that begins on Monday.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Trade and economic relationships will be a primary focus of the conference that begins on Monday.", "title": "Obama hosts Africa summit with an eye on legacy - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/479613_Obama-Africa.JPEG-01896.jpg", "height": 936}, "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/08/02/obama-hosts-africa-summit-with-an-eye-on-legacy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trade and economic relationships will be a primary focus of the conference that begins on Monday.", "title": "Obama hosts Africa summit with an eye on legacy - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/479613_Obama-Africa.JPEG-01896.jpg", "creator": "@pressherald", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Business", "published_time": "2014-08-02T11:03:22-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdad3\"", "article_summary": "And he\u2019s launched a fellowship program for young African leaders that received more than 50,000 applications for 500 slots this year.\nAdditional Images President Barack Obama speaking at a business forum aimed at increasing investment in Africa, in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania in July, 2013.\n\u201cWe are less focused on resources from Africa and more focused on deepening trade and investment relationships.\u201d\nBut the backdrop for the conference that begins Monday underscores what has been a constant challenge to that effort.\nU.S. officials try to draw a distinction between Chinese and American investment in Africa."}
