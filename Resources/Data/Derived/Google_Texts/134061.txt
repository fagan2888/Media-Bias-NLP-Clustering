Seventh graders meet with congressman, ask about standardized testing and Affordable Care Act.

Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen knows all about sharing his line of work with his father.

From that standpoint, he has much in common with Robert and Joshua Weinstein, the father and son combination of teachers in the Parsippany School District.

Frelinghuysen (R-11) visited Joshua Weinstein’s seventh grade social studies class at the Brooklawn Middle School this week, just before speaking with Robert Weinstein’s IPLE class at Parsippany Hills High School.

Students asked the nine-term congressman about the current situation in the Ukraine and Russia, Affordable Care Act, and standardized testing among other issues.

“The questions echoed a theme as the students become increasingly aware of the world around them,” Joshua Weinstein said.

Frelinghuysen often visits schools and students in his congressional district during recess from Washington D.C., and is a native of Morris County.
