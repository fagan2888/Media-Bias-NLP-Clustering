First Hillary Clinton told a woman at the Dem town hall tonight that was hurt by Obamacare to “keep shopping.” Then she cackled at the thought of coal miners losing their jobs. And now this…

“I am already receiving messages from leaders — I’m having foreign leaders ask if they can endorse me to stop Donald Trump.”

Clinton actually believes that voters care what foreign leaders think about who is best to lead America and stop Donald Trump? She went on to name drop the Italian prime minister as someone who has already publicly endorsed her:

Donald Trump is going to hit this one out of the park.
