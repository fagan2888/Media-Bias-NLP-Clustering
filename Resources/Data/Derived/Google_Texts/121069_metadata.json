That approach, studied for about 20 years, hasn\u2019t caught on widely in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nBut some companies and academic labs are pursuing it to create medicines and vaccines against such targets as HIV, cancer, the deadly Marburg virus and norovirus, known for causing outbreaks of stomach bug on cruise ships, as well as Ebola.\n\nWhile most of the work in this area uses a tobacco plant, it\u2019s just a relative of the plant used to make cigarettes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not something you smoke,\u201d said Jean-Luc Martre, a spokesman for Medicago, a Canadian company that\u2019s testing flu vaccines made with tobacco plants.\n\nMedicago has a new production facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. Once approved by federal authorities, it\u2019s expected to be able to make 30 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine a year, or 120 million vaccine doses to fight a major outbreak of \u201cpandemic\u201d flu if the government requests it.\n\nScientists favor tobacco plants because they grow quickly and their biology is well understood, said Ben Locwin, a pharmaceutical biotech consultant in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, who is considered an expert on plant-produced medicines by the American Association of Pharmaceutical Scientists.\n\nThe North Carolina operation can handle as many as 90,000 plants. Under the whir of fans, rows of young seedlings grow for about a month, until they are about a foot tall. Then they are taken by robots to another section of the facility, turned upside down and dipped in a tank to be \u201cinfiltrated\u201d with whatever proteins they wish to grow.\n\nThere are a number of Ebola treatments and vaccine in development, and one comes from tobacco plants grown in specialized greenhouses at another operation, Kentucky BioProcessing, in Owensboro, Kentucky.\n\nThat experimental treatment, called ZMapp, uses proteins called antibodies, and is designed to inactivate the Ebola virus and help the body kill infected cells. It hasn\u2019t been tested in people but had shown promise in animal tests, so it was tried in three people sickened by Ebola in West Africa \u2014 two U.S. aid workers and a Spanish missionary priest, who later died.\n\nThe last few doses available are in Liberia. Kentucky BioProcessing, which produces it for the San Diego-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical, said it would take several months to make more, but it is working to increase production.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ebola puts focus on drugs made in tobacco plants", "title": "Ebola puts focus on drugs made in tobacco plants", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Ebola puts focus on drugs made in tobacco plants", "title": "Ebola puts focus on drugs made in tobacco plants", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/15/ebola_puts_focus_on_drugs_made_in_tobacco_plants/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/ebola-plant-medicines.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ebola puts focus on drugs made in tobacco plants", "title": "Ebola puts focus on drugs made in tobacco plants", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/ebola-plant-medicines.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Malcolm Ritter", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b80\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not something you smoke,\u201d said Jean-Luc Martre, a spokesman for Medicago, a Canadian company that\u2019s testing flu vaccines made with tobacco plants.\nThere are a number of Ebola treatments and vaccine in development, and one comes from tobacco plants grown in specialized greenhouses at another operation, Kentucky BioProcessing, in Owensboro, Kentucky.\nThat experimental treatment, called ZMapp, uses proteins called antibodies, and is designed to inactivate the Ebola virus and help the body kill infected cells.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 It\u2019s an eye-catching angle in the story of an experimental treatment for Ebola: The drug comes from tobacco plants that were turned into living pharmaceutical factories.\nUsing plants this way \u2014 sometimes called \u201cpharming\u201d \u2014 can produce complex and valuable proteins for medicines."}
