With few exceptions, companies don\u2019t actively support the intellectual diversity of the workforce. For this reason, among others, I advise my students to take that math class before they graduate, even though they\u2019re not a \u201cmath person\u201d; to take that literature class even though they were \u201calways bad at writing\u201d; and to start forming a habit of reading smart and thoughtful things from opposing points of view.\n\nThe end of college shouldn\u2019t be the end of one\u2019s life of the mind, but the reality is that increased productivity in the U.S. economy has not translated into increased leisure time. The last thing many of us want to do at the end of a long day of work is pick up an annotated copy of \u201cTristram Shandy\u201d and get lost in the footnotes, or settle into a debate with an ideological adversary about the decline of free speech in academe.\n\nI note this because it\u2019s now fashionable to think of colleges and universities as particularly stunted environments, as if there exists another social institution on so large a scale that\u2019s more likely to bring a plurality of viewpoints into dialogue while accommodating inevitable miscues throughout the learning process. Colleges still have conservative clubs (if not, start one on your campus in 11 easy steps), College Democrats, democratic socialists, college libertarians, and in some cases \u201cwhite student unions.\u201d How many political advocacy groups are active in your office? Virtually no one else in the world has more time and institutional support to explore a diversity of ideas than the college student.\n\nFor this reason, without question, colleges should be held to higher intellectual development standards than workplaces. What we\u2019re witnessing lately, however, is not good-faith interest in students\u2019 intellectual development so much as confirmation bias in favor of a clich\u00e9. There\u2019s now a desire to see in every ripple of student protest or ideological confrontation on campus a signal that \u201cliberal intolerance\u201d or social justice progressivism is killing free speech.\n\nA representative example of this desire to wring hands over the progressive college environment is Catherine Rampell\u2019s recent Washington Post opinion piece, \u201cLiberal Intolerance Is on the Rise on America\u2019s College Campuses.\u201d Rampell boasts \u201chard data\u201d to demonstrate the titular claim, so let\u2019s take a look at this \u201chard data.\u201d\n\nFor decades, UCLA\u2019s Higher Education Research Institute has been surveying incoming college students about a variety of things, including political views. Rampell cites what looks like alarming data on a pair of questions in the survey: whether colleges should \u201chave the right to ban extreme speakers from campus,\u201d and whether we should \u201cprohibit racist/sexist speech on campus.\u201d The survey\u2019s weighted national norm for the former question indicates 43% of respondents either \u201cagree strongly\u201d or \u201cagree somewhat\u201d that colleges should have the right to ban extreme speakers from campus. For the latter, 71% of respondents \u201cagree strongly\u201d or \u201cagree somewhat\u201d that colleges should prohibit racist/sexist speech on campus. As Rampell observes, these percentages are both significantly greater than in previous years.\n\nWhile this \u201chard data\u201d would seem to confirm that \u201cliberal intolerance\u201d is an enemy of free speech on campus, that claim is questionable. For one\u2014as Rampell notes as an afterthought\u2014the UCLA survey data are for college-bound students who haven\u2019t yet set foot on campus. Thus, the progressive disposition of these soon-to-be college students is by definition not a function of the \u201cliberal\u201d college environment. In fact, if we look comparatively at Pew Research Center data on millennials, which splits respondents into those with a college degree, those with some college education and those who never attended college, respondents with a college degree are the least likely to support \u201ccensoring offensive statements about minorities.\u201d Those with a college degree are also the most likely to support the idea that \u201cpeople should be able to say [offensive] things publicly.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Actual data does not support conclusion that \"liberal intolerance\" is a college problem or a free speech problem", "title": "The big millennial p.c. lie: Why conservatives and the media keep pushing the myth of campus intolerance", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Actual data does not support conclusion that \"liberal intolerance\" is a college problem or a free speech problem", "title": "The big millennial p.c. lie: Why conservatives and the media keep pushing the myth of campus intolerance", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/02/28/the_big_millennial_p_c_lie_why_conservatives_and_the_media_keep_pushing_the_myth_of_campus_intolerance/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/columbia_statue_tape.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Actual data does not support conclusion that \"liberal intolerance\" is a college problem or a free speech problem", "title": "The big millennial p.c. lie: Why conservatives and the media keep pushing the myth of campus intolerance", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/02/columbia_statue_tape.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Aaron Hanlon", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Editor's Picks, Higher education, millennials, political correctness, Race", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Thus, the progressive disposition of these soon-to-be college students is by definition not a function of the \u201cliberal\u201d college environment.\nWhile this \u201chard data\u201d would seem to confirm that \u201cliberal intolerance\u201d is an enemy of free speech on campus, that claim is questionable.\nFor the latter, 71% of respondents \u201cagree strongly\u201d or \u201cagree somewhat\u201d that colleges should prohibit racist/sexist speech on campus.\nFor one\u2014as Rampell notes as an afterthought\u2014the UCLA survey data are for college-bound students who haven\u2019t yet set foot on campus.\nVirtually no one else in the world has more time and institutional support to explore a diversity of ideas than the college student."}
