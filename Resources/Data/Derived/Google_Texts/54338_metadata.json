Seriously. The author of the letter claims to be a Republican but votes for Mann when she runs because she \u201ccan do the work that needs to get done regardless of party.\u201d\n\nThere is a special election coming up on May 19th for the New Hampshire House in the towns of Nottingham, Northwood, Deerfield and Candia. These towns combined make up Rockingham\u2019s 32nd district which was previously won by a Republican who had to step down for employment reasons. Two candidates are running for the spot \u2013 Maureen Mann as the Democrat and newcomer Yvonne Dean-Bailey as the Republican.\n\nDean-Bailey is a young conservative who handily won her primary election but she\u2019s also been the victim of discriminatory attacks by Democrats. In another letter an author writes that Dean-Bailey shouldn\u2019t be elected because she doesn\u2019t own a home. Sounds reminiscent of past draconian laws where people weren\u2019t allowed to vote if they didn\u2019t own property (poor people, women, blacks). The same letter states that Mann works tirelessly yet wonders how Dean-Bailey can handle college; writing for Campus Reform and supporting her constituents. Seriously?\n\nSo why not take a look at Maureen Mann\u2019s voting record and see how much she actually represents her solidly Republican district. Voters in the district have made the mistake of voting for Mann previously:\n\nNot only did Mann vote for Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid Expansion which will eventually force an income and/or sales tax in New Hampshire but she did so against the majority of her constituents who are against Obamacare.\n\nMann also voted for the gas tax increase which shows her affinity for raising taxes.\n\nMann voted for increasing the minimum wage which has historically been proven to hurt young workers the most as well as hurt small business.\n\nApparently Mann is also against school choice and voted to repeal the Education Tax Credit that helps poor children choose a better education through scholarships.\n\nMann also is against Granite Staters protecting themselves anywhere other than their homes; therefore, turning law-abiding citizens who are being attacked by a criminal into criminals for daring to save their own lives or stop an attack.\n\nThese are just a few of Mann\u2019s more egregious votes. You can see more of her horrific voting record at Project Vote Smart.\n\nSeveral things are clear from Mann\u2019s voting record: she is against the 1st and 2nd Amendments; she believes government should be bigger and have more control over your lives and she has no problem raising taxes. Her website actually claims the complete opposite of her voting record by stating the following:\n\n\u201cI pledge to be fiscally responsible, protective of individual rights, attentive to local needs, supportive of families and responsive to constituents.\u201d\n\nThis is why it is vital to listen to the statements candidates make and verify the truth by looking at their voting record if they have one. Clearly Mann is lying on her candidate page which means she\u2019s lying right to voters\u2019 faces when she speaks to them. Her voting record proves, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that she is lying.\n\nThe election isn\u2019t until May 19th which is less than a month away. Voters of Rockingham\u2019s 32nd district can do themselves a favor by actually looking into Mann\u2019s record before making the same mistake twice. While Dean-Bailey doesn\u2019t have a voting record, it\u2019s clear she aligns with the majority of voters in the district. She's the clear choice over Mann since voters already know the damage Mann has done to \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d New Hampshire in the past. Mann\u2019s lying to voters should be reason enough to turn away from her.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Yesterday there was a letter to the editor in the Concord Monitor asking voters in Rockingham\u2019s 32nd district to vote for Democrat Maureen Mann because she help", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"url": "http://www.examiner.com/article/maureen-mann-is-lying-to-voters-rockingham-s-32nd-her-votes-prove-it", "site_name": "Examiner.com", "image": "http://cdn2-b.examiner.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_content_width/hash/92/67/92674349a6fb47de1b95f20d9dc7af10.jpg?itok=D-co5Xkh", "type": "article", "title": "Maureen Mann is lying to voters in Rockingham\u2019s 32nd.
