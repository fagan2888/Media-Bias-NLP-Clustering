Members typically meet every six months for workshops on health care design and innovation, but a highlight for the organization is its biennial \u201copen space\u201d event. This three-day \u201cun-conference\u201d has no agenda other than bringing together bright minds to tackle some of the world\u2019s most pressing health care problems on a tight budget.\n\nBoston University hosted the most recent ILN InPerson Biennial Open Space under the guidance of Beverly Brown, development director of the Center for Global Health and Development and wife of University President Robert A. Brown. About 80 attendees divided into groups according to their personal interests. They spent the first two days taking \u201csafaris\u201d around Boston University, meeting with people like Catherine Klapperich, a College of Engineering associate professor of biomedical engineering and of mechanical engineering, who designs medical devices that can withstand primitive conditions in third-world countries; Brian Jack, a School of Medicine professor and chair of family medicine, who leads Project RED, an innovative and nationally recognized hospital discharge procedure; and Deborah Frank, a MED professor of pediatrics and director of the Grow Clinic for Children, who gave a demonstration at Boston Medical Center\u2019s Preventive Food Pantry on how to prepare food for people living with diabetes.\n\nChris McCarthy, director of ILN at Kaiser Permanente, described Open Space as \u201clots of water cooler conversations\u201d among leading health care professionals. The goal is \u201cto create new friendships and strengthen ones that exist,\u201d he said. \u201cThe deeper these friendships are, the easier for innovation to happen.\u201d\n\nOn the third and final day of the un-conference, teams gathered in the Trustees Ballroom at One Silber Way to pitch innovative ideas. Attendees texted their votes of support, \u201cjust like American Idol,\u201d said McCarthy.\n\nOver a lunch of salmon, toast, and asparagus, eight groups had two minutes apiece to describe their projects and why they were important. They also had to estimate the cost of funding the project. Teams selected one of three funding categories: $12,500, $7,500, and $2,500. Those who went over their presentation time were ushered offstage by Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Ted Eytan, who approached the podium and hugged them into compliance. The teams were allowed 90 seconds to answer questions before the final boot. Audience members scored each group, marking one number for the general worth of the idea and another for how solid it was as an ILN project. The total helped determine the leaders in each funding category.\n\nFormulating pitches is hardly foreign in this crowd, Brown explained: \u201cThese people have to do it in their day jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes anyone in this room not have access to a cell phone?\u201d asked event MC McCarthy. He gave a wry smile as no hands were raised. \u201cThat\u2019s really good.\u201d Judging by technical difficulties later, he should have asked if everyone knew how to use said cell phone.\n\nPitches varied greatly. Some groups wanted to duplicate existing programs they\u2019d visited, like Health Leads, a program begun at Boston Medical Center in 1996 that seeks to address all patients\u2019 basic resource needs as a standard part of quality care, or the clinics at the Boston Healthcare for the Homeless Program (BHCHP). Others proposed weaning BHCHP\u2019s homeless population from tobacco through the introduction of e-cigarettes, and still others hoped to launch an ILN Carbon War Room\u2014basically a way to measure the organization\u2019s carbon footprint. (One observer asked, \u201cCan you not call it the war room?\u201d Hugger-turned-presenter Eytan replied, \u201cIf you give us a couple of points, we\u2019ll change it.\u201d)\n\nAll pitches complete, McCarthy explained how to text in votes. \u201cThe system will know if you try to do more than two,\u201d he warned. On a projector screen at the front of the room, bars on a graph displaying the vote count began to shrink and expand wildly. \u201cEverybody stop,\u201d he said. \u201cI see you, stop voting!\u201d After rebooting the program and guiding the less tech-savvy through the process, he asked everyone to vote again. Whispered consultations buzzed around the room while pinging sounds announced the arrival of votes. Everyone stared intently ahead to learn the fate of their pitch.\n\n\u201cHow do we know if our vote got up there and we didn\u2019t mess up?\u201d asked Yasmin Staton, a senior communications consultant for Kaiser Permanente.\n\n\u201cMagic,\u201d McCarthy said with a shrug.\n\nWith all votes in, McCarthy announced the winners. The group that pitched the Global Lab for Innovation in Health earned the $12,500 prize, which members said they will use to build an online network for health care professionals to exchange information about innovative and sustainable solutions to complex medical problems. The group suggesting e-cigarettes for the homeless took home $7,500. And the group pitching Community Care Connect, which will mimic the Health Leads model in another part of the country, earned $2,500.\n\nAttendees seemed pleased with the results of their American Idol\u2013like exercise. Instead of rushing off to the airport or back to their offices, they stuck around for more water cooler conversations.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "BU Today", "description": "Innovative ideas pitched at BU-hosted event", "title": "Health Care Leaders Think Big on a Small Budget | BU Today | Boston University", "url": "http://www.bu.edu/today/2013/health-care-leaders-think-big-on-a-small-budget/", "image": "http://www.bu.edu/today/files/2013/09/t_13-6674-HEALTHCONF-109-332x221.jpg", "type": "article"}, "last-updated": "2013-09-18T17:19:30-04:00", "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "Copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Boston University"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2e67\"", "article_summary": "This three-day \u201cun-conference\u201d has no agenda other than bringing together bright minds to tackle some of the world\u2019s most pressing health care problems on a tight budget.\nMembers typically meet every six months for workshops on health care design and innovation, but a highlight for the organization is its biennial \u201copen space\u201d event.\nChris McCarthy, director of ILN at Kaiser Permanente, described Open Space as \u201clots of water cooler conversations\u201d among leading health care professionals.\nAnd the group pitching Community Care Connect, which will mimic the Health Leads model in another part of the country, earned $2,500.\nHealth Care Leaders Think Big on a Small Budget Innovative ideas pitched at BU-hosted eventWith debate over the debt ceiling and how to implement (or rescind) the Affordable Care Act expected to consume much of Congress\u2019 attention in the coming months, Washington pols would be wise to follow the work of the Innovation Learning Network (ILN)."}
