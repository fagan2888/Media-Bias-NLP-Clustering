Before making any new commitments we asked ourselves; is it affordable, is it sustainable and is it our job\" said Love, Republican Candidate.Doug Owens is a political newcomer, but it runs in his blood. His father, Wayne was a congressman for the state of Utah.Owens is hoping to keep the seat vacated by Representative Jim Matheson in democratic hands.\"Utah deserves a representative who will go to Washington and remember where they come from and who they represent. Not somebody who will go and represent another ideology or just vote a party line,\" said Owens.The two went back and forth on key issues to cap off the Utah Debate Commission series of debates.Offering voters a choice on education.Owens believes the Department of Education plays an important role.\"I'm not satisfied that Utah is dead last in terms of per pupil expenditures and I've got an opponent that will make that worse by eliminating the Department of Education and the 12% of Utah funding,\" said Owens.Love refers to the federal government as the \u201cBerlin Wall,\u201d and says education decisions should be made close to home.\"A lot of our funding is going into Washington bureaucrats and too little of our funding is going into our classrooms and what we need to do is get that decision making back to our classrooms and back to our states,\" said Love.They also offered opposing views on the Affordable Care Act.Love says it should be repealed and has a plan to replace it.\"My plan takes a three pronged approach to reducing costs, improving outcomes and improving patient experience,\" said Love.Owens says repealing it is unrealistic.He says parts of it just need to be fixed.\"I do not like tying the provision of health insurance to employment. I think that's a big mistake,\" said Owens.At one point the exchange even got off topic when Love took exception with Owens' strategy.\"I find it interesting that my opponent claims he wants to end the dysfunction, yet on the other hand he does everything he can to attack,\" said Love.Owens insists it's about drawing a distinction for voters.\"I do feel it incumbent upon me to point out the differences on issues. Some of these are extreme issues that do not reflect, I think Utah values,\" said Owens.There is conflicting information on how this race is playing out.Polling from Love shows her 19 points ahead, polling from Owens cuts it to a 3 point lead and an independent poll from Utahpolicy.com , conducted by Dan Jones & Associates gives Love a 9 point lead.Voters will settle the contradiction on November 4, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salt Lake City, Utah- (ABC 4 Utah) \u2013 Two of the candidates in the most closely watched congressional race in Utah made their pitch to the voters Tuesday night.", "author": "Glen Mills", "og": {"site_name": "GOOD4UTAH", "description": "Salt Lake City, Utah- (ABC 4 Utah) \u2013 Two of the candidates in the most closely watched congressional race in Utah made their pitch to the voters Tuesday night.", "title": "Love and Owens differ on education, Affordable Care Act and other issues in Utah Debate Commission finale", "url": "http://www.good4utah.com/electioncandidates/love-and-owens-differ-on-education-affordable-care-act-and-other-issues-in-utah-debate-commission-finale", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/good4utah/photo/2014/10/14/Story_3804874_ver1.0_640_360.jpg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 892575284135831}, "google-site-verification": "M98d-N8fsKcOgZeokPDXfFxSWw2Jj8LX5NM_t_Hr7Hc", "keywords": "doug owens,mia love,4th congressional district,utah debate commission,glen mills,election news,electioncandidates,local (utah/state news)", "article": {"section": "ElectionCandidates", "tag": "doug owens, mia love, 4th congressional district, utah debate commission", "published_time": "2014-10-15T10:47:09+0000", "modified_time": "2014-10-15T10:47:09+0000"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc353\"", "article_summary": "I think that's a big mistake,\" said Owens.At one point the exchange even got off topic when Love took exception with Owens' strategy.\nBefore making any new commitments we asked ourselves; is it affordable, is it sustainable and is it our job\" said Love, Republican Candidate.Doug Owens is a political newcomer, but it runs in his blood.\n\"Utah deserves a representative who will go to Washington and remember where they come from and who they represent.\n\"I do feel it incumbent upon me to point out the differences on issues.\nHis father, Wayne was a congressman for the state of Utah.Owens is hoping to keep the seat vacated by Representative Jim Matheson in democratic hands."}
