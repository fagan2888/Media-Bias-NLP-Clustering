In many cases, Congress has abdicated its constitutional responsibilities, preferring to criticize rather than legislate. It is easier, for example, for members of Congress to attack executive orders on immigration than to reform immigration law.\n\nAnother way to thwart majority rule is to transfer rule-making about domestic safety, privacy, health and the environment from national legislatures to unelected bodies like the secretive transnational committees that negotiate trade deals. Some of the deals also expose nations to lawsuits by corporations or individual investors who claim to be adversely affected by domestic laws or policies. You don\u2019t have to be a protectionist to believe that the delegation of national rule-making authority to unelected officials influenced by corporate representatives and nongovernmental organization staffers sacrifices too much popular sovereignty for what many would consider minor economic gains.\n\nAs a result of all of these trends, the power of electoral majorities really has ebbed away to a great extent. When people keep putting money into a vending machine that does nothing, or gives them the opposite of what they ordered, some of them will kick the vending machine or turn it over.\n\nVoter apathy and disenchantment is a political problem that can be solved only by political reforms that give nonelite voters more actual power to affect policy outcomes \u2014 not by a new tax credit here or a wage subsidy there.\n\nWorthwhile reforms like automatic voter registration (now limited to Vermont, Oregon, California and West Virginia), online voting, and voting on weekends or a special national holiday instead of on Tuesdays would not necessarily increase voter turnout much, if many continue to see voting as ineffectual. According to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll from the last presidential election cycle, 59 percent of respondents said that they didn\u2019t bother to pay attention to politics because \u201cnothing ever gets done; it\u2019s a bunch of empty promises.\u201d Demoralizing paralysis in government may be more effective in disenfranchising citizens than photo-ID laws.\n\nBASIC civil rights should not depend on majorities at any level of government. And social insurance programs are most efficient and fair when they are uniform and national, like Social Security and Medicare, unlike Medicaid and unemployment insurance, which vary among states because they are funded both by federal and state governments. But in many other areas of public policy, majorities should be allowed to prevail.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe higher the level of government that makes a decision, the less influence ordinary citizens will have. Corporate lobbies or well-funded NGOs that lose battles at the local level can try to persuade state legislatures or members of Congress to reverse the results. In contrast, working-class Americans on the losing end of a local ordinance are unlikely to prevail in the state capital or Washington. Convincing alienated American citizens that their votes count must begin with empowering the city and county governments in which they have the greatest influence.\n\nIn some states, this might mean loosening strict constitutional or statutory limits on the tax and expenditure authority of local governments, like California\u2019s 1978 ballot initiative Prop 13, which restricted the autonomy of local governments when it came to property taxes. When such limits prevent municipal governments from raising adequate revenues, they may be forced to resort to regressive and more burdensome revenue collection methods like user fees and sales taxes.\n\nCities and counties should also have more freedom to experiment, without being constrained by interest groups working through state legislatures. For example, in many states private Internet service providers have used their clout in state capitals to prohibit or obstruct municipal broadband systems.\n\nFor its part, Congress can share power as well as money with local voters by putting fewer constraints on the revenues it shares with state and local governments for purposes like education, health and infrastructure.\n\nAt the level of local government, electoral reforms like ranked choice (instant runoff) voting, which transfers the second-choices of voters who backed losing candidates when there wasn\u2019t a clear winner, can give all voters more influence than standard winner-take-all rules. A number of cities, including San Francisco and Oakland in California and Takoma Park, Md., have adopted ranked choice voting in recent years.\n\nIn an earlier era of white supremacy and Protestant Christian hegemony, the United States was what the Washington Post columnist Fareed Zakaria and others call an \u201cilliberal democracy,\u201d characterized by majoritarian tyranny. But the solution is not the other extreme of technocratic rule by purportedly enlightened elites, described by the Harvard political theorist Yascha Mounk as \u201cundemocratic liberalism.\u201d\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nMajorities need to be constrained when it comes to essential rights. But removing too many decisions from local to remote governments and from legislators answerable to voters to unelected judges, executive officials and treaty negotiators, is likely to create a democratic deficit that provokes a backlash against the system.\n\nIf we want to avert the sense of powerlessness among voters that fuels demagogy, the answer is not less democracy in America, but more.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160514152716, "twitter": {"description": "Despite appearances, the populist backlash reflects a democratic deficit.", "title": "Is There Too Much Democracy in America or Too Little?", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/opinion/campaign-stops/is-there-too-much-democracy-in-america-or-too-little.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004404120"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/15/opinion/sunday/15lind/15lind-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/opinion/campaign-stops/is-there-too-much-democracy-in-america-or-too-little.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004404120", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/opinion/campaign-stops/is-there-too-much-democracy-in-america-or-too-little.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/campaignstops", "hdl_p": "Is There Too Much Democracy in America or Too Little?", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "May 14, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Trump  Donald J,Presidential Election of 2016,Sanders  Bernard,Voting and Voters,United States Politics and Government", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Michael Lind", "SCG": "campaign-stops", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Sanders, Bernard", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By MICHAEL LIND", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Despite appearances, the populist backlash reflects a democratic deficit.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/15/opinion/sunday/15lind/15lind-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/15/opinion/sunday/15lind/15lind-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "Despite appearances, the populist backlash reflects a democratic deficit.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "May 14, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-05-18", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "United States Politics and Government", "published": "2016-05-14", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "15lind", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160518193903, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/15/opinion/campaign-stops/is-there-too-much-democracy-in-america-or-too-little.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/15/opinion/sunday/15lind/15lind-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Despite appearances, the populist backlash reflects a democratic deficit.", "title": "Is There Too Much Democracy in America or Too Little?"}, "pdate": 20160514, "des": "United States Politics and Government", "articleid": 100000004404120, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Is There Too Much Democracy in America or Too Little?", "col": "Opinion", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "article_summary": "If we want to avert the sense of powerlessness among voters that fuels demagogy, the answer is not less democracy in America, but more.\nCorporate lobbies or well-funded NGOs that lose battles at the local level can try to persuade state legislatures or members of Congress to reverse the results.\nIt is easier, for example, for members of Congress to attack executive orders on immigration than to reform immigration law.\nIn some states, this might mean loosening strict constitutional or statutory limits on the tax and expenditure authority of local governments, like California\u2019s 1978 ballot initiative Prop 13, which restricted the autonomy of local governments when it came to property taxes.\nCities and counties should also have more freedom to experiment, without being constrained by interest groups working through state legislatures."}
