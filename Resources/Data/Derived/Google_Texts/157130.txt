Five people were killed and three others hospitalized after a three-alarm fire broke out Sunday morning at a senior living apartment building in the San Antonio suburb of Castle Hills.

Bexar County Fire Marshall spokeswoman Laura Jesse said the cause of the fire at Wedgwood Apartments in the 6700 block of Blanco Road is under investigation, NBC News reported.

A total of 150 firefighters from San Antonio and area municipal fire departments responded to the scene, a local CBS affiliate reported. Firefighters reportedly carried some elderly residents out windows and down ladder trucks.

Five victims were reportedly killed in the fire, while three others were injured. One victim is in critical condition, officials said.

Some 75 evacuees were taken to a local high school. Residents are either being reunited with their families or taken to a hotel so they have a place to stay, the CBS affiliate said.

It was not immediately clear if those killed in the fire were residents of the building.
