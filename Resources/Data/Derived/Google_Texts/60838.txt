About 200 people at the Peco Foods processing plant in Canton will be tested for tuberculosis after an employee tests positive for the disease.

Mississippi State Department of Health spokeswoman Liz Sharlot said Friday the employee no longer works at the chicken plant. Sharlot tells WAPT-TV the people who worked the same shift as the sick employee will be tested, as will family members and some employees who have left in the past couple of months.

The first round of blood tests will be conducted Tuesday and will be followed in eight to 10 weeks with a second round of testing -- all paid for by the company. If someone tests positive, health officials will interview them and do more tests.
