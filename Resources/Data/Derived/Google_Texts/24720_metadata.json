It\u2019s what they call \u201cThe Zone.\u201d\n\nRockies third baseman Nolan Arenado \u2014 who took over baseball\u2019s lead in RBIs (68) with two more home runs against the Giants on Sunday \u2014 seems like he is hitting a beach ball.\n\nBut it\u2019s not that easy.\n\n\u201cWhen (Madison) Bumgarner is throwing, the ball doesn\u2019t look very big,\u201d Arenado said.\n\nEither way, Arenado is rolling. He hit a home run Sunday off Bumgarner, a two-run rocket in the first inning, and a solo shot off Sergio Romo in the ninth.\n\nNow in his third big-league season, Arenado has five multihomer games \u2014 and three have come in the past week. He did it once against the Diamondbacks and twice against the Giants.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to do my job the best I can,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a good week. And it\u2019s happened \u2014 I\u2019ve had a good week, then the next week is not very good. As long as we win and pick each other up, that\u2019s the key.\u201d\n\nWith Arenado on a hot streak, pitchers are trying to avoid him. He is seeing fewer fastballs early in counts. But the results aren\u2019t changing much.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of first-pitch off speed. I haven\u2019t really been hitting them great. But whenever I get a pitch up in the zone, I\u2019ve been hitting them,\u201d Arenado said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to take advantage of mistakes they\u2019re throwing. That\u2019s what you have to do when you play in the big leagues.\u201d\n\nAdd in Arenado\u2019s 17 doubles and three triples, and his 177 total bases this season rank second in the major leagues, behind Cincinnati third baseman Todd Frazier (183).\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely in a zone,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said.\n\nLineup switcheroo from manager Walt Weiss\n\nAgainst Bumgarner, last season\u2019s World Series MVP, Weiss got creative with a right-handed-heavy lineup. And he bumped second baseman DJ LeMahieu to leadoff, followed by Troy Tulowitzki.\n\n\u201cDJ strings together very competitive at-bats, one after another, every day,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s been getting on base. It seemed like a natural fit.\u201d\n\nWeiss went with Tulowitzki in the two-hole to get a \u201cpowerful right-handed bat in the second spot.\u201d\n\nCharlie Blackmon, the left- hitting center fielder, got a day off from the starting lineup before subbing in the eighth inning. He has played in all but one game this season.\n\n\u201cI was looking for a day to give Charlie,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHe\u2019s been going to the post every day. I wanted to get him off his feet.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead\n\nRockies\u2019 David Hale (2-2, 5.86 ERA) at Athletics\u2019 Kendall Graveman (4-4, 3.86), 8:05 p.m. Monday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nHale allowed a career-high five earned runs against Houston on June 18. Then he tied the mark last week against Arizona. He is looking to get back on track in the Rockies\u2019 series opener against Oakland. In his start against Houston, Hale struck out nine and walked just one before fading. He can miss bats with his pitch mix, but he needs to gain endurance to weather middle-inning storms. This will be just the second start for Hale away from Coors Field this year. In his other Bay Area start, his season debut May 23, Hale gave up two earned runs to San Francisco in a 5-3 win for the Rockies.\n\nTuesday: Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (4-3, 5.15 ERA) at Athletics\u2019 Sonny Gray (9-3, 2.09), 8:05 p.m., ROOT\n\nWednesday: Rockies\u2019 Chad Bettis (4-2, 3.56) at Athletics\u2019 Jesse Hahn (5-6, 3.47), 1:35 p.m., no TV\n\nThursday: Rockies\u2019 Chris Rusin (3-2, 4.69) at Diamondbacks\u2019 TBA, 7:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nNick Groke, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nolan Arenado stays on a power trip against Giants", "title": "Nolan Arenado stays on a power trip against Giants", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/28/nolan-arenado-stays-on-a-power-trip-against-giants/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150628__nolan-arenadop1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150628__nolan-arenadop1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-28T20:16:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T19:05:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb008\"", "article_summary": "This will be just the second start for Hale away from Coors Field this year.\n\u201cDJ strings together very competitive at-bats, one after another, every day,\u201d Weiss said.\nNow in his third big-league season, Arenado has five multihomer games \u2014 and three have come in the past week.\nBut whenever I get a pitch up in the zone, I\u2019ve been hitting them,\u201d Arenado said.\nAs long as we win and pick each other up, that\u2019s the key.\u201dWith Arenado on a hot streak, pitchers are trying to avoid him."}
