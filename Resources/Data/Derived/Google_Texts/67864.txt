A hammer-wielding Bronx man was charged Thursday with carrying out a series attacks that ended when he was shot by police in Midtown after allegedly striking an NYPD officer.

Police charged David Baril, 30 years old, with seven counts of assault and one count of criminal weapons possession in a spree that criss-crossed Manhattan.

Mr. Baril, of the Bronx, is in critical condition at Bellevue Hospital Center and could not be reached for comment. It was not immediately clear if an attorney had been assigned to his case.

Mr. Baril was shot three times by Officer Geraldo Casaigne after he attacked the officerâ€™s partner with a hammer Wednesday morning during a fast-moving confrontation that was caught on surveillance video, authorities said.
