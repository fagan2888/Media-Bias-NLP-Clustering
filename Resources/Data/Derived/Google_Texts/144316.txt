Hello again!

A miracle has happened to fast food. We don't have to worry anymore about what it's doing to our bodies because there are so many super healthy menu options! I know this because I've been studying the documentary evidence, the superinformative ads all the fast food companies are making. Seriously. Who needs Obamacare when there's BurgerCare? This news is so satisfrying! Enjoy!

Yours,
