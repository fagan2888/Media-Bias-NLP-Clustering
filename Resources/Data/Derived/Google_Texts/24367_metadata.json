RIGHT?: Stop us if you\u2019ve heard this one before, but it looks like we don\u2019t have any breakthroughs yet on the big deal to make temporary tax provisions permanent. Talks continued over the weekend, and tax writers and congressional leaders will continue to hash it out as the House and the Senate seek a year-end spending deal.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThere\u2019s a hope among some negotiators that they can wrap up the tax side of negotiations as soon as tonight. But it remains unclear whether Congress will land on the big deal, or the two-year extension of the expired tax breaks. And remember this: There\u2019s no guarantee that lawmakers will beat their new next deadline for funding the government, Wednesday \u2014 meaning that the end game for Washington remains unclear less than two weeks before Christmas.\n\nWHAT\u2019S THE HOLD UP?: As Tax Pro Brian Faler reported, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi expressed her distaste for the large extenders deal \u2014 likely costing well over a half trillion dollars over a decade \u2014 in the clearest terms yet on Friday. Indexing the Child Tax Credit to inflation remains a major concern for House Democrats, well over a week after Senate Democrats dropped that idea as a major demand. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to hear about that,\u201d Pelosi said about the GOP.\n\nThe minority leader has been using her opposition to the tax extenders deal as leverage, given that Speaker Paul Ryan is going to almost certainly need Democratic votes to pass the omnibus. \u201cIt\u2019s too big, it\u2019s unfair and does not have the support of House Democrats,\u201d Pelosi said of the potential tax deal.\n\nPelosi also seemed to suggest on Friday that the big extenders deal could harm any hopes for tax reform \u2014 which is basically the opposite of what many Republicans think.\n\nIT\u2019S MONDAY, and could this actually be Congress\u2019s last week in town in 2015? We know plenty of people that hope so. In the meantime, we hope those celebrating have had a good Hanukkah.\n\nWe\u2019ll take your tips even if time is running short on policymaking this year \u2014 and maybe even because it is.

Twitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brian_faler, @katyodonnell_ , @POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax.\n\nKEEP \u2018EM SEPARATED: In any event, Pelosi made it clear on Friday that she thought that extenders and the omnibus needed to be separate ventures. She\u2019s not alone: House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California said much the same thing, Pro Energy\u2019s Darren Goode reported... (And yes, that header is a \u201890s music reference.)\n\nOTHER HICCUPS: We noted last week that Ryan wasn\u2019t showing any interest in putting an artificial deadline on getting the omnibus done, and that he wouldn\u2019t guarantee that Congress would hit the new Dec. 16 deadline.\n\nRyan says that\u2019s to make sure the spending deal is done right, but there\u2019s also some frustration among the tax negotiators about the floating deadline for end-of-the-year priorities. It certainly sounds like some of them would prefer to have a hard-and-fast date for when the big tax deal would have to be done.\n\n** A message from the American Suntanning Association: A 10% tan tax was included in the ACA; this tax has shuttered 9,600 small businesses (70% women-owned) and eliminated 81,000 jobs from our economy while only generating 30% of its promised revenue. Repeal cannot wait: abolishing the tan tax must be part of the 2015 tax extenders bill. http://bit.ly/1HUIAON **\n\nONE LAST THING: Pelosi and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland certainly don\u2019t sound like fans of a major tax deal. But other House Democrats are saying not to be surprised if a deal that would delay the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Cadillac tax, a priority of organized labor, and permanently extended the child credit and Earned Income Tax Credit got a significant amount of support from them \u2014 even if the child credit doesn\u2019t get indexed.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of items that are being proposed, at least on the periphery, that we have either already voted for or have spoken favorably of,\u201d Rep. Richard Neal of Massachusetts, a senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters on Friday.\n\nRAISE YOUR HAND: If you thought that a group of accountants could undercut a major bipartisan initiative for the Senate Finance Committee this year. Because the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) did play a major role in blocking a Senate bill meant to battle tax return fraud, and Tax Pro Katy O\u2019Donnell tells you how.\n\nSome new tidbits: sources say GOP Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Dan Coats of Indiana led the charge in September to delay consideration of the bill, which would give the IRS broader power to regulate paid tax preparers \u2014 a major no-no among conservatives who remain angry about the agency\u2019s treatment of Tea Party groups seeking tax-exempt status.\n\nBut while it might not have been too hard to gin up GOP anger at the IRS, there are some tax analysts wondering why AICPA is even bothering given that most taxpayers don\u2019t use an accountant to figure out their taxes. But the group doesn\u2019t want to give the paid preparers who don\u2019t have the same sort of raining a \u201creputational boost,\u201d as Katy put it, from an IRS seal of approval.\n\nStill, even with the Senate bill likely off the calendar until at least 2016, AICPA faces other challenges in keeping the IRS from getting more oversight of paid preparers. There\u2019s a new House GOP bill to give the IRS such powers, raising questions about whether the extenders bill could have some anti-fraud provisions. That\u2019s unlikely, but the very fact that House Republicans have such a bill \u201cunderscores the likelihood that such a measure will eventually make it through Congress.\u201d More from Katy: http://politico.pro/1P1Kv5x\n\nDON\u2019T FORGET PARIS: As it turns out, it\u2019s not just folks on the right who are upset about the major climate change agreement recently clinched in Paris. The Guardian notes that James Hansen, a former NASA scientist and an early leader in drumming up action against climate change, called the Paris deal a \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201cfake\u201d because it didn\u2019t call for a carbon tax.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry responded to that criticism on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday: \u201cWith all due respect to him, I understand the criticisms of the agreement because it doesn't have a mandatory scheme and it doesn't have a compliance enforcement mechanism. That's true. But we have 186 countries, for the first time in history, all submitting independent plans that they have laid down, which are real, for reducing emissions.\u201d\n\nKerry added: \u201cThe result will be a very clear signal to the marketplace of the world that people are moving into low carbon, no carbon, alternative renewable energy.\u201d http://bit.ly/1Qfv1fB\n\nWHAT\u2019S ON THE BLOCK?: Some of the 50-plus temporary tax provisions whose fate is currently uncertain get more media attention than others (EITC! R&D! NASCAR!). The Wall Street Journal takes a look at another of the extenders \u2014 a provision for distressed homeowners that waives taxes on short sales, and how the uncertainty has the real estate industry sweating.\n\n\u201cRealtors argue that the provision remains vital because otherwise homeowners will have an incentive to let their homes go into foreclosure, rather than try to come to an agreement with the bank.\u201d http://on.wsj.com/1QnbglY\n\nYOU'RE INVITED!

A lot of the redevelopment projects for those lands are stalled, starving struggling Atlantic City of needed tax revenue. http://bit.ly/1QFGmUE\n\nTAX-FREE BULLETS: Jerry Costello II, an Illinois state representative, has proposed a measure to ban local governments from implementing their own taxes on guns and ammunition.

Tuesday, December 15 - Doors at 8 a.m. - The Mayflower Hotel - 1127 Connecticut Ave. NW. RSVP: http://politi.co/1jTIaMT\n\n** A message from the American Suntanning Association: Nearly 10,000 small business owners (70% women-owned) in the tanning salon industry have closed their doors since the 10% tan tax was included in the ACA, and the tax eliminated more than 80,000 women-held jobs. Only 30% of forecasted revenues have been raised, yet 2,000 businesses close annually with 15,000 jobs disappearing. The tax is a net loser. To make matters worse, estimates have found the IRS\u2019 cost to administer the tax is 13 % of receipts collected.\n\nBipartisan legislation, H.R. 2698, has been introduced to repeal this job-killing tax. Small businesses can\u2019t wait any longer. A provision to repeal the 10 % tax on tanning salon services must be included in this year\u2019s tax extenders bill. Doing so will have the immediate result of halting job losses, boosting economic growth in every state and increasing income and payroll tax collections as an industry is allowed to operate freely again. http://bit.ly/1HUIAON **", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Pelosi makes her distaste clear \u2014 Keep the omnibus and extenders separated?", "title": "Is this the week for extenders?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-tax/2015/12/is-this-the-week-for-extenders-pelosi-makes-her-distaste-clear-keep-the-omnibus-and-extenders-separated-211739", "image": "http://static.politico.com/97/de/e15842c94e928ce8b561e20745a0/whitelogoondots.jpeg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Pelosi makes her distaste clear \u2014 Keep the omnibus and extenders separated?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A provision to repeal the 10 % tax on tanning salon services must be included in this year\u2019s tax extenders bill.\nRepeal cannot wait: abolishing the tan tax must be part of the 2015 tax extenders bill.\nIs this the week for extenders?\nThe minority leader has been using her opposition to the tax extenders deal as leverage, given that Speaker Paul Ryan is going to almost certainly need Democratic votes to pass the omnibus.\nThere\u2019s a new House GOP bill to give the IRS such powers, raising questions about whether the extenders bill could have some anti-fraud provisions."}
