PeaceHealth\u2019s small Cottage Grove hospital saw charity care drop 30 percent in 2014; its Peace Harbor Hospital reported a 33.3 percent drop; in Eugene, PeaceHealth hospital charity care fell 27.4 percent, and in Riverbend it was down 15 percent.\n\nFor a deeper look into the finances of this multi-state hospital chain, click here. For the fourth year, The Lund Report is digging deep into the finances of Oregon\u2019s hospitals.

But the hard-won union contract came only after the chain\u2019s profits climbed by 58.4 percent.\n\nPeaceHealth was founded more than a century ago by nuns, and has since grown to become a major force in Pacific Northwest healthcare, with a three-state network of clinics, labs and hospitals. The chain now operates ten hospitals in Oregon, Washington and Alaska.\n\nPreviously based in Bellevue, Wash., the nonprofit expanded into the Portland-metro area beginning in 2011, when it acquired Southwest Washington Medical Center and a few months later decided to move its headquarters to Vancouver, Wash.\n\nSince then, the chain has continued to grow, largely by inking deals to manage public hospitals in Washington state. Because of its Catholic affiliation, some communities have raised concerns that patients in PeaceHealth-served communities may not have access to certain forms of reproductive and end-of-life care.\n\nCourtney Sherwood covers money, data and public records for The Lund Report.
