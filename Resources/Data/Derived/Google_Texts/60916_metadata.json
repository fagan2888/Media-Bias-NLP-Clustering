Sestak's staffers said it would air throughout the state, and filings from broadcast stations show that his campaign purchased ad slots beginning Wednesday in the Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Scranton media markets.\n\nThe ad buy comes as outside spending is beginning to flow into the four-way Democratic race to take on Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey.\n\nAccountable Leadership, a super PAC supporting Sestak, is spending $250,000 on ads across the state that detail Sestak\u2019s 2010 race against Republican Pat Toomey, the three decades he spent in the Navy, and his stint in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nEMILY\u2019s List, a national group that supports female Democratic candidates, announced last week that it will spend $1 million to promote former environmental protection secretary Katie McGinty with ads beginning next month.\n\nMcGinty also has begun airing her own biographical ads in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh media markets. Braddock Mayor John Fetterman, who also is seeking the Democratic nomination, is airing ads on cable and broadcast in the Pittsburgh media market.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Joe Sestak launches first TV ad", "Description": "Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Joe Sestak is airing his first television ad, launching\u00a0a minute-long spot that emphasizes\u00a0his military career.
