No fatalities were reported, and authorities got the road open again by Saturday.\n\nIn Arizona, rain came down Saturday as more than 8,000 cyclists competed in the annual El Tour de Tucson. Also, high school football games, soccer tournaments and parades were canceled across the state.\n\nForecasters said parts of both California and Arizona could expect severe weather with winter storm warnings through Saturday. Weather officials said the mountains and the Antelope Valley foothills northeast of Los Angeles were under the most risk.\n\nHowever, they said there was only a small chance of rainstorms like those that prompted flooding in California on Thursday.\n\nIn New Mexico, it was unclear where the heaviest bands of snow would develop, said meteorologist Jennifer Palucki.\n\nIn Texas, freezing rain and cold temperatures have already hampered travel and much of the \u201cheavy stuff\u201d will hit south of Interstate 20, Harris said.\n\nSeveral traffic accidents were reported Saturday, including the fatal crash late Friday that also left several injured in Vega, about 30 miles west Amarillo.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Powerful storm system kills 8 in Western U.S.", "title": "Powerful storm system kills 8 in Western U.S.", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/23/powerful-storm-system-kills-8-in-western-u-s/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131123__20131124_A6_ND24STORMp1.jpg", "height": 490}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131123__20131124_A6_ND24STORMp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-23T18:40:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-29T11:57:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "ALBUQUERQUE \u2014 A powerful storm system that has caused hundreds of accidents across the western U.S. marched eastward Saturday with predictions of widespread snow, freezing temperatures and gusty winds.\nIn Texas, freezing rain and cold temperatures have already hampered travel and much of the \u201cheavy stuff\u201d will hit south of Interstate 20, Harris said.\nIn California, where the storm system hit first, prompting flooding and water rescues in recent days, three deaths have been linked to the storms since Thursday.\nThree other storm-related deaths were reported Saturday in a crash in the Texas Panhandle involving nearly a dozen vehicles.\nForecasters said parts of both California and Arizona could expect severe weather with winter storm warnings through Saturday."}
