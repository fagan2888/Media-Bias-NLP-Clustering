In addition, IMA also has a diagnostic testing center, a registered dietician and physical therapists.\n\nSmall in that all of IMA\u2019s facilities are with a 10-mile radius of each other and they can be \u2013 and should be \u2013 viewed as a single practice, as they use the same electronic health records platform to keep everyone in every location informed.\n\nLinda Schwimmer, vice president of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute, said the idea has a lot of merit.\n\n\u201cI think this is the way the health care system needs to go and I think it\u2019s the way it will go,\u201d she said.\n\nSchwimmer said the integration between the two \u201cmakes a lot of sense\u201d as the urgent care centers backstop the primary care offices by providing extended hours, seven days a week, while at the same time maintaining the patient relationship with their primary care doctor.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t expect people to fully utilize primary care if you have very limited hours,\u201d she said.\n\nFebus agrees.\n\nIMA, he said, operates on the \u201cpatient centered medical home\u201d model, where care is delivered by a team of clinicians who closely monitor patient health. IMA\u2019s eight care coordinators develop care plans, particularly for patients who require specialist and/or hospital care. The care coordinators follow up with when they are discharged from the hospital, to keep the care plan on track.\n\nFebus said the care coordinators focus on patients who need constant attention, such as those with chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.\n\n\u201cWhat we are saying is, \u2018This is how we can make you better.\u2019 By having care plans, we are working with the specialists in conjunction with the primary care physicians for the best care for the patient.\u201d\n\nIf an IMA patient is seen over the weekend at one of IMA\u2019s urgent care centers, that patient\u2019s primary care doctor is notified on Monday.\n\n\u201c(So the doctor) pulls up the electronic record and sees what the patient came in (to urgent care) for and what was the diagnosis,\u201d Febus said.\n\nThus IMA is better able to avoid the fragmented care that results when patients decide to visit an urgent care center or ER, but don\u2019t keep their primary care doctor in the loop.\n\nAnd with IMA, patients have access to so much care.\n\n\u201cWe offer physical therapy because it\u2019s just the next bridge to help our patients recover and live healthy lifestyles,\u201d Febus said. \u201cAnd we added a registered dietitian for our diabetic patients. We\u2019re not just taking care of the patient for that one ailment: We want our patients to live healthier, better lifestyles.\u201d\n\nFebus said IMA is in network with all the health plans serving New Jersey, including Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, Aetna, Cigna and UnitedHealthcare. To encourage the kind of care coordination that IMA provides, the insurers make extra care coordination payments to IMA.\n\n\u201cIt allows us to cover the cost for the extra people we need,\u201d Febus said \u201cIn most cases it doesn\u2019t cover 100 percent. Primary care operates on a tight margin, but our physicians believe this is better care.\u201d\n\nMost primary care offices in New Jersey are one or two physician practices. Febus said IMA\u2019s size is a key advantage, enabling it to provide patient care when and where needed. The three urgent care centers open at 7 a.m., giving patients the option of dropping in to see a doctor on their way to work.\n\nIts size also allows IMA to employ care coordinators.\n\n\u201cIt is much more difficult for a one-physician practice to offer all these services,\u201d Febus said. \u201cWe have a network that allows us to share personnel among our offices.\u201d\n\nIMA has enough patients to justify a registered dietician on staff, something out of reach for a small practice. And it\u2019s looking to grow and broaden its clinical network.\n\nFebus said IMA will soon have a podiatrist, and is looking at bringing some specialists on board. He said the care coordinators devote a lot of their time to educating patients to take charge of their health \u2014 something experts contend is essential to improving population health.\n\n\u201cOften people want to be healthy but they just don\u2019t know how \u2014 or they need that extra incentive or push,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said IMA avoids excess diagnostic testing, which is a major factor in escalating U.S. health costs.\n\n\u201cWhen you are testing for many things you are being reactive because you are trying to cure an ailment or illness,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are trying to be proactive and nip it in the bud before people get sicker.\u201d\n\nALSO ON NJBIZ:\n\nMost-read May 13: Morris Plains' Lorenzo taking ClutterCrashers concept to companies\n\n\n\nStudy: Superstorm Sandy increased rates of depression, PTSD, alcohol and substance abuse\n\nNo-debt performing arts festival celebrates 10th year in Princeton", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "NJBIZ", "description": "Is combining primary care and urgent care the answer to better health care in the age of the Affordable Care Act?", "title": "Integrated Medicine Alliance finds success combining primary care with urgent care | NJBIZ", "url": "http://www.njbiz.com/article/20140514/NJBIZ01/140519909/integrated-medicine-alliance-finds-success-combining-primary-care-with-urgent-care", "image": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20140514/NJBIZ01/140519909/AR/0/AR-140519909.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "njbiz.com", "description": "Is combining primary care and urgent care the answer to better health care in the age of the Affordable Care Act?", "title": "Integrated Medicine Alliance finds success combining primary care with urgent care | NJBIZ", "image": {"src": "http://www.njbiz.com/storyimage/NJ/20140514/NJBIZ01/140519909/AR/0/AR-140519909.jpg"}, "site": "@njbiz", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Is combining primary care and urgent care the answer to better health care in the age of the Affordable Care Act?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Is combining primary care and urgent care the answer to better health care in the age of the Affordable Care Act?\nPrimary care operates on a tight margin, but our physicians believe this is better care.\u201dMost primary care offices in New Jersey are one or two physician practices.\nIntegrated Medicine Alliance, a large Monmouth County primary care practice where more than three dozen clinicians have join forces at nearly a dozen locations, feels it is.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t expect people to fully utilize primary care if you have very limited hours,\u201d she said.\nLinda Schwimmer, vice president of the New Jersey Health Care Quality Institute, said the idea has a lot of merit."}
