The sun\u2019s rays are evil, the government tells us, and we should avoid them like the plague.\n\nSo why has mankind not died out from sun-caused disease thousands of years ago?\n\nThere would be nothing without the sun \u2014 no animals, plants or government bureaucrats looking for something to regulate. Man has always toiled beneath it, chasing buffalo on the American plains, growing crops in barbarian Europe, catching fish in pre-dynastic China. Are we really \u201charmed\u201d by its rays more than they were?\n\nOur bodies require sun, as well as life-sustaining salt and fats our surgeon general also says we don\u2019t need. Maybe what we don\u2019t need is a surgeon general.\n\nThe precursor of today\u2019s surgeon general was the Marine Hospital System, established in 1798 to care for injured sailors. In 1889, Congress authorized the Commission Corps, a mobile army of physicians led by a surgeon general. It was a noble beginning with a focused cause made up of doctors providing care.\n\nNow devolved into Nanny State Central, the surgeon general\u2019s office has become spokesman for intrusive government policies that unnecessarily frighten people, try to control their personal decisions, and made up primarily of bureaucrats, whether or not they have \u201cM.D.\u201d after their names.\n\nIn four years, the budget for the surgeon general has nearly doubled to $2.3 million in 2014 with another increase expected for 2015. Meanwhile, U.S. Marine and Navy personnel, for whom the office was originally established, suffer under massive cuts that have caused Pentagon brass to express serious concerns about their readiness under President Obama\u2019s 2015 budget proposals.\n\nThe fundamental problem with the surgeon general is that it is a political appointment. Either by force or gleeful acquiescence, recent surgeons general have been political pawns, including Bush appointee Vice Adm. Richard Carmona, who testified to Congress after his retirement that the administration had pressured him to be more \u201cpolitical.\u201d The current acting surgeon general, Rear Adm. Boris Lushniak, is a vocal supporter of Obamacare, as was his predecessor and fellow Obama appointee Dr. Regina Benjamin. Clinton surgeon general Dr. Joycelyn Elders was an ardent supporter of Hillarycare proposals.\n\nIf the \u201cnation\u2019s doctors\u201d can dole out politically motivated insurance advice, their ability to deliver sound, agenda-free health guidance is also questionable. On the specific question of \u201cexposure,\u201d we are getting too much White House-focused surgeon general and not enough science \u2014 or sun.\n\nAn August study by the American Academy of Neurology found low Vitamin D levels (delivered through UVB rays) are a major contributing factor to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, stroke and all forms of dementia. A moderate Vitamin D deficiency can cause a 51 percent increase in dementias; a severe deficiency, 122 percent. This is a profound finding.\n\nResearch recently published in the British Journal of Dermatology (and ignored by our medical bureaucrats) found increased rates of melanoma were not the result of too much sun exposure, but the benefit of \u201cdiagnostic drift\u201d \u2014 increased awareness of the disease by the public and physicians, leading to hikes in identifying the disease in early, rather than latter, stages. This is good news, as melanoma is a dreadful and deadly disease, but more rapid identification does expand the universe of diagnostic numbers.\n\nThis study and another in the prestigious medical journal Lancet also found skin cancers increasing at greatest rates among indoor workers, though Vitamin D-producing UVBs don\u2019t pass through windows. Other global studies have found that more sun actually protects against melanoma and leads to lower incidences of breast, colorectal and ovarian cancers and that 30 percent of cancers could be prevented with adequate UVB exposure.\n\nThe surgeon general continues to suggest we get our Vitamin D from foods or supplements despite consensus among scientists that only UVB rays are adequate for good health. We need several hours of exposure every week \u2014 without sunscreen. Moderation and common sense are key whether you get your Vitamin D fix outside or from a turn in an indoor tanning booth.\n\nDespite pronouncements about banning tanning, in a July interview, Dr. Lushniak admitted he \u201creally didn\u2019t\u201d know what is causing rising skin cancer diagnoses. But scientists do, and increases in early detection is a welcome result. Both that data and the critical importance of natural or machine-generated UVB rays to American health seem to be missing from his briefing papers.\n\nOn Halloween, goodies from the surgeon general\u2019s house might include tubes of sunscreen, shakers of salt substitutes and Obamacare applications.\n\nPerhaps instead he should be giving out his resignation \u2014 and we should insist that science, and not political cronies, inform Americans on critical health issues.\n\nKerri Toloczko is a senior fellow at Frontiers of Freedom, a public-policy institute dedicated to promoting individual freedom, limited government and free enterprise.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The sun is ever shooting healthful rays at us, even as the surgeon general of the United States suggests we dart for cover under sunscreen and hats.
