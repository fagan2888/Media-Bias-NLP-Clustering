Fewer than half of the companies voluntarily report the information.\n\nThe report also found that CMS paid over $1 billion in 2009 for drugs prescribed by people who did not have the authority to do so, such as nutritionists.\n\nPanel Chairman Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) told Dr. Shantanu Agrawal, director of the CMS Center for Program Integrity, that by the time he next testifies before the committee, the recommendations should be implemented.\n\n\u201cSome have been sitting around for more than ten years, and that\u2019s just not acceptable,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nRep. Diana DeGette (Colo.), the top Democrat on the committee, did not take as sharp a tone as some Republicans, but also said more work can be done.\n\n\u201cPart D remains vulnerable to fraud, and there are additional opportunities to identify fraud, waste and abuse,\u201d she said.\n\nAgrawal said that the administration is working on the recommendations but that they take time.\n\n\u201cOn every recommendation, we have worked to make progress,\u201d he said. \u201cThese recommendations do take time to implement.\u201d\n\nFraud in the program is linked to the opioid abuse crisis, as doctors can illegitimately prescribe drugs that are abused.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about a funding stream from the federal government that is helping to facilitate the use of narcotics in our country,\u201d said Rep.
