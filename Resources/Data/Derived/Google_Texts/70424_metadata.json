(WLFI) \u2014 Agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration simultaneously raided multiple doctor\u2019s offices in central Indiana Friday, as well as individual physicians including one doctor in Lafayette. According to the DEA, all were suspected of illegally prescribing synthetic drugs.\n\nThe raids follow a nine month investigation and began at 7 a.m. They were run by the Drug Opiate Recovery Network (DORN).\n\nThe raided offices were described as \u201ccash and carry\u201d operations where hundreds of patients would arrive and trade cash for prescriptions for Suboxone, a synthetic heroin substitute.\n\n\u201cWe had customers that are clients that are from all over the state of Indiana to these clinics and out of state,\u201d Hamilton-Boone Drug Task Force Maj. Aaron Dietz said.\n\nInvestigators said the ring leader was Doctor Larry Ley, of Noblesville. He operated DORN in offices in several cities including Kokomo. That\u2019s where Dr. Luella Bangura traveled from Lafayette to practice once a week.\n\nInvestigators said on several occasions Bangura wrote more than 120 prescriptions a day for Suboxone, a synthetic heroin substitute. It took about one minute for people to walk in, get their prescription and be out the door.\n\n\u201cWe ran seven undercovers in 27 undercover visits into this. There was no physical, no blood pressure, no blood work, no anything sort of like that to get these prescriptions,\u201d DEA Assistant Special Agent-In-Charge Dennis Wichern said.\n\nInvestigators said there was an initial cost of $300 for patients, then they would pay $160 a month for future prescriptions. It\u2019s estimated Ley wrote about 8,500 prescriptions in 2013 and made more than $700,000.\n\n\u201cIn a four-hour period, we counted approximately 120 people in one Saturday at $120 a piece. I think the math is over $10,000 straight cash,\u201d Wichern said.\n\nBangura faces four counts of dealing a controlled substance and one count of corrupt business influence. Her Lafayette office was not involved in this investigation.\n\nThe following individuals were also arrested:\n\nDr. Larry Ley\n\nDr. George Agapios\n\nDr. Ronald Vierk\n\nDr. Luella Bangura\n\nHamilton County Attorney Andrew Dollard\n\nDEA agents also responded to the following offices:\n\n23 East Main Street, Suite 200, Carmel\n\n813 Westfield Boulevard, Suite 100, Noblesville\n\n121 North High Street, Muncie\n\n3827 South LaFountain, Kokomo\n\n801 Airport Road, Centerville\n\nInvestigators said prosecutors working on this case were also involved in Kokomo doctor Don Wagoner\u2019s case. Wagoner pleaded guilty to over prescribing drugs earlier this year.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "LAFAYETTE, Ind.
