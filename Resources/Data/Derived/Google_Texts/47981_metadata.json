But for the drag queen, whose journey of self-discovery took her from bigoted small-town Austria to her emotional victory at the 2014 Eurovision song contest, the last 10 months appear to have confirmed that her path \u2014 though not always easy \u2014 was the right one.\n\nShe rubs shoulders with fashion icons Jean-Paul Gaultier and Karl-Lagerfeld and plays sold-out gigs across Europe. Her appearances on Austrian radio talk shows attract callers from as far away as California.\n\nU.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has paid his respects. She has addressed the European Parliament on LGBT rights, and her biography has just appeared in German, with other languages to follow.\n\nLess than a year ago, over 15,000 Russians demanded that their state broadcaster purge the contest from its programming because of Wurst, accusing \u201cEuropean liberals\u201d of subjecting their children to a \u201chotbed of sodomy.\u201d\n\nThe haters still exist \u2014 but Wurst says there is also a growing group of \u201cincredible\u201d Russian fans pushing to have her biography published in Russia.\n\n\u201cI made the decision years ago not to focus on negativity,\u201d she said. And since the win, \u201cmany people have told me that they have changed their mind about me \u2014 they got inspired, which is just overwhelming for me.\u201d\n\nHer fuchsia-colored blouse and green skirt perfectly accenting her makeup, Wurst looked as if she were never anyone else than the persona that has made her famous.\n\nBut even if she says that she is now immune to hate, that wasn\u2019t always so.\n\nBorn 25 years ago to innkeepers as Tom Neuwirth, Wurst was raised in the sleepy Austrian town of Bad Mittendorf, where conservative values were the norm \u2014 not a very comfortable place for someone who was different even as a child.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AP Interview: Bearded Austrian diva is living her dream.", "title": "AP Interview: Bearded Austrian diva is living her dream.", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "AP Interview: Bearded Austrian diva is living her dream.", "title": "AP Interview: Bearded Austrian diva is living her dream.", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/14/ap_interview_bearded_austrian_diva_is_living_her_dream/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/austria-conchita-10-months-on.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AP Interview: Bearded Austrian diva is living her dream.", "title": "AP Interview: Bearded Austrian diva is living her dream.", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/austria-conchita-10-months-on.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "George Jahn", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbbb1\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m living my dream,\u201d Conchita Wurst told The Associated Press in an interview.\n\u201cEverything fell into the right place for me.\u201dEverything may be a big word.\nHer appearances on Austrian radio talk shows attract callers from as far away as California.\nShe has addressed the European Parliament on LGBT rights, and her biography has just appeared in German, with other languages to follow.\nBut even if she says that she is now immune to hate, that wasn\u2019t always so."}
