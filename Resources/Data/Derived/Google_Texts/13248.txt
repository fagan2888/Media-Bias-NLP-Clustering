The read on real estate in the neighborhood of Back Bay in Boston, Massachusetts, with P.T. Vineburgh, Charlesgate Realty Group.

Boston real estate kicked into high gear this spring, after record-setting snows kept homes off the market and buyers inside. Home sales in Boston were up nearly 9 percent in June from a year ago, even as the inventory of homes for sale decreased, according to the Greater Boston Association of Realtors.

That helped drive the median home price to over $400,000, a 5.5 percent increase from a year ago, figures CoreLogic.
