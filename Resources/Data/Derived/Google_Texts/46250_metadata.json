(AP) - Wyoming\u2019s Senate defeated a bill Friday to expand the federal Medicaid program - apparently killing any chance the state will find a way this year to extend health insurance to thousands of low-income adults.\n\nMedicaid expansion is a key element of the federal Affordable Care Act and has come under fire for years from Republicans in Congress. The state Senate voted 19-11 against the bill.\n\nGov. Matt Mead, a Republican, opposed expansion in Wyoming for most of his first term. But this year he urged lawmakers to approve an expansion bill, saying Wyoming can no longer afford to forego federal funds.\n\nWashington pledges to cover 100 percent of expansion costs through 2016, dropping to 90 percent after that.\n\nThe bill\u2019s main sponsor, Sen. Michael Von Flatern, R-Gillette, said expansion would provide health care coverage to 17,600 people in Wyoming, bring more than $100 million a year in new federal funds and create about 800 jobs.\n\nSeveral senators said Friday they don\u2019t trust federal promises to keep paying. Some said they don\u2019t want to contribute to the national debt by accepting more federal dollars in any case.\n\n\u201cMake no doubt about it, this saddles more debt upon your children and your grandchildren,\u201d said Sen. Larry Hicks, R-Baggs, who voted against the bill.\n\nVon Flatern said that Friday\u2019s vote could make it harder to get expansion in the future because the bill to the state will be higher.\n\nAfter the vote, Rep. Elaine Harvey, R-Lovell, chairman of the House Labor, Health and Social Services Committee, said her committee wouldn\u2019t consider a parallel Medicaid expansion bill.\n\n\u201cWe still have those people who are uninsured, and we still have those medical facilities that are not financially healthy. We need to take care of them,\u201d Harvey said. \u201cBut I saw it as an exercise in futility to move forward.\u201d\n\nThe Wyoming Hospital Association has pushed expansion. It says hospitals around the state are stuck with hundreds of millions of dollars in uncompensated costs annually as uninsured people are treated at emergency rooms.\n\nTom Forslund, director of the Wyoming Department of Health, had told lawmakers that expansion wouldn\u2019t affect the state\u2019s general fund because it would relieve pressure on other state health programs.\n\nChesie Lee, lobbyist for the Wyoming Association of Churches, had supported Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked on this for three years now, and to think that they\u2019ve not been able to come up with a way to cover the people who are in that coverage gap is extremely disappointing,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the money\u2019s not there. It is there. It\u2019s a matter of the political will to do it.\u201d\n\nA similar proposal in Tennessee died Wednesday when that state\u2019s Senate Health Committee defeated Republican Gov. Bill Haslam\u2019s proposal to extend health coverage to 280,000 low-income residents.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wyoming's Senate defeated a bill Friday to expand the federal Medicaid program - apparently killing any chance the state will find a way this year to extend health insurance to thousands of low-income adults.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Wyoming\u2019s Senate defeated a bill Friday to expand the federal Medicaid program - apparently killing any chance the state will find a way this year to extend health insurance to thousands of low-income adults.", "title": "Wyoming Senate rejects Medicaid expansion", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/6/wyoming-senate-set-for-final-vote-on-medicaid-expa/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/06/93d14553f93166056d0f6a706700ecda.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/06/93d14553f93166056d0f6a706700ecda.jpg", "description": "Wyoming's Senate defeated a bill Friday to expand the federal Medicaid program - apparently killing any chance the state will find a way this year to extend health insurance to thousands of low-income", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Wyoming Senate rejects Medicaid expansion"}, "Author": "BEN NEARY", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd000\"", "article_summary": "Chesie Lee, lobbyist for the Wyoming Association of Churches, had supported Medicaid expansion.\nIt\u2019s a matter of the political will to do it.\u201dA similar proposal in Tennessee died Wednesday when that state\u2019s Senate Health Committee defeated Republican Gov.\nMedicaid expansion is a key element of the federal Affordable Care Act and has come under fire for years from Republicans in Congress.\nBut this year he urged lawmakers to approve an expansion bill, saying Wyoming can no longer afford to forego federal funds.\nAfter the vote, Rep.
