Collier County deputies are encouraging car owners to push the lock button. This comes after they say Ryan Keegan broke into seven cars while drunk.

Investigators found Keegan after left he some incriminating evidence behind.

Ana Juarez was all smiles and thankful the bizarre crime turned out the way it did.

"He took the screens off of our windows like he was trying to break in," said Juarez.

The accused burglar decided breaking into the home was just too much work, so he went for the car instead.

"He slept in my sister's car. He left his T-shirts in there," said Juarez.

Collier County deputies say Keegan broke into at least six other cars in Naples along and near 98th Avenue North.

Investigators say it was fairly easy to nab him for the crime.

"He left an iPod in there too. He was using it as like a cave, like a man cave. It was really weird," said Chad Joseph, a victim's boyfriend.

The weirdness, detectives say, didn't stop at that home.

Another neighbor had surveillance video apparently showing Keegan walking without a shirt on.

Another homeowner told deputies she found Keegan's wallet.

"You think you live in a nice neighborhood and things like that, then stuff like this happens," said Joseph.

Detectives say Keegan was drunk and didn't remember much. He lives minutes away from the Juarez home.

The suspect's family is not talking tonight.

As for the car Keegan is accused of using as a pit stop, Juarez says the car was cleaned out the next day.

"All the seats were down. It was gross," said Juarez.
