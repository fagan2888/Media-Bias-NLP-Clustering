A lean at the line. A next-to-nothing margin over a more-than-game challenger.\n\nSure, for Usain Bolt, the winning result, the bow-and-arrow victory celebration and even the setting may have been the same as 2008. But the show he put on Sunday in a .01-second victory over Justin Gatlin at the Bird\u2019s Nest was something very different.\n\nBolt crossed the line in 9.79 seconds \u2014 pedestrian by his standards. Yet it very well may have been his greatest race ever.\n\n\u201cMy coach said, \u2018You\u2019ll have to run 100 meters if you\u2019re going to win the race,'\u201d Bolt said after capturing his record ninth career gold medal at world championships. \u201cSo I ran 100 meters.\u201d\n\nThe 29-year-old Jamaican came in hurting and anything but race ready \u2014 a far cry from seven years ago, when he put his stamp on the Beijing Olympics in the same stadium by slowing down and bringing his hands out to his side to start the celebration with 20 meters left. Even with that, he crossed the line in a then-world-record time of 9.69 seconds.\n\nBy now, that\u2019s ancient history, and the proof was in the results from the last two years. Gatlin has been dominating the sprint game, while Bolt has spent more time rehabbing than racing.\n\nThe problems carried right into Sunday. Bolt\u2019s semifinal run \u2014 normally a stress-free jog \u2014 turned dicey when he stumbled on his fifth step out of the starting block. He was in sixth place more than halfway through and had to push to beat out Trayvon Bromell.\n\nIn the next semifinal race, Gatlin breezed, just as he had the night before in the heats. Set against each other, those performances turned Gatlin into the betting favorite, and who could argue?\n\nAnd so, the stakes were set: The world-record holder and track\u2019s happy warrior against a twice-convicted doper, who also won the 100 at the 2004 Olympics and the world championships in 2005.\n\nThat Gatlin burst from the blocks faster was no surprise; Bolt was his typically slow self in unfurling his 6-foot-5 frame from the start.\n\nThat Gatlin was winning at the halfway point wasn\u2019t too shocking, either. \u201cThe best part of my race is usually the end,\u201d Bolt said.\n\nAt 80 meters, the math started changing. Bolt drew to within a step but Gatlin was holding him off.\n\nThen, with about 15 meters left, Gatlin over-strided, then did it again, then started leaning toward the line. Bolt stayed upright, crossed with a big kick and with his chest pushed forward. A sliver of space for a man who wins by body lengths.\n\nAfter eyeing the scoreboard, Bolt punched his right fist down and kicked his left leg up, a clearly unchoreographed celebration for a man who often starts planning them while the race is still going. It was the closest 100 final at the worlds since 2003, when Kim Collins edged Darrel Brown by .01.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I guess I would say I gave the race away the last five meters,\u201d Gatlin said.\n\nA bitter pill for the 33-year-old ex-champ, who handled it with his typical class, but still gets asked about his doping past no matter what the result.\n\n\u201cHe served his suspension, and all of a sudden, self-righteous people who\u2019ve never done anything wrong in their lives want to vilify him,\u201d said Gatlin\u2019s agent, Renaldo Nehemiah.\n\nAlso winning gold medals Sunday were Jessica Ennis-Hill of Britain in the heptathlon, Joe Kovacs of the United States in the shot put and Pawel Fajdek of Poland in the hammer throw.\n\nGatlin will presumably get another chance at gold, and another chance at Bolt, on Thursday in the 200-meter final \u2014 the race Bolt has always called his favorite.\n\nNo matter how it goes, there figures to be some drama and tension between these two over the next 11 K months, as the lead-in to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro heats up.\n\nIn Rio, Bolt will try to make it 3 for 3 at the Olympics in the 100, 200 and the 4\u00d7100 relay. He\u2019ll go there having proven something that most long-time champions have to prove sooner or later: That he could win a close one when he wasn\u2019t close to his best and his opponent was.\n\n\u201cAsk any athlete, and they\u2019ll tell you, if you start doubting yourself, you\u2019ve already lost,\u201d Bolt said. \u201cI never started doubting myself. I just tried to put together a race.\u201d\n\nHe did.\n\nAnd so, the final photo taken on the track looked like so many others that Bolt\u2019s taken over the years: The World\u2019s Fastest Man holding that long, languid bow-and-arrow pose \u2014 smiling, playing to the crowd.\n\nWhat a race.\n\n\u201cI was screaming. I was screaming because I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen,\u201d Bolt\u2019s father, Wellesley, said after a harrowing night in the stands. \u201cBut we know Usain. He\u2019s a very stubborn man and he didn\u2019t give up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Usain Bolt beats Justin Gatlin for gold in 100 at worlds", "title": "Usain Bolt beats Justin Gatlin for gold in 100 at worlds", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/23/usain-bolt-beats-justin-gatlin-for-gold-in-100-at-worlds/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150823_092959_usain-bolt.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150823_092959_usain-bolt.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-23T09:20:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T05:51:03+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMy coach said, \u2018You\u2019ll have to run 100 meters if you\u2019re going to win the race,'\u201d Bolt said after capturing his record ninth career gold medal at world championships.\nIn the next semifinal race, Gatlin breezed, just as he had the night before in the heats.\nGatlin will presumably get another chance at gold, and another chance at Bolt, on Thursday in the 200-meter final \u2014 the race Bolt has always called his favorite.\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I guess I would say I gave the race away the last five meters,\u201d Gatlin said.\nSure, for Usain Bolt, the winning result, the bow-and-arrow victory celebration and even the setting may have been the same as 2008."}
