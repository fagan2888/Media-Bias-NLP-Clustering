Elizabeth Warren. Even Hillary Clinton.\n\nPresident Barack Obama can\u2019t seem to get any powerful member of his own party to support him on his trade initiative, complicating the chances for what he sees as a major late-term win for his legacy.\n\nClinton has backed off her support of the looming trade initiative on the campaign trail. Reid gave Obama a quick \u201chell no\u201d when asked by reporters if he supported the deal. And Warren, the progressive favorite and senator from Massachusetts, has gone on the warpath, framing the issue in a larger fight over income inequality. The Democratic infighting has opened up comparisons to the Republican Party\u2019s \u201ccivil war\u201d over the past few years.\n\n\u201cWell I guess they don\u2019t want it to happen,\u201d Obama told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews in an interview on Tuesday about the Democratic opposition, as he tried to assuage liberals\u2019 concerns about the deal. \u201cAnd I love Elizabeth. We\u2019re allies on a whole host of issues. But she\u2019s wrong on this.\u201d\n\nWarren fired back in a tweet Wednesday morning, hitting on a criticism of the negotiation\u2019s transparency:\n\nThe Obama Admin says I'm wrong \u2013 we shouldn't worry about TPP. So why can\u2019t the American people read the deal? http://t.co/PoavXNJlRS \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) April 22, 2015\n\nWhy\u2019s this happening now?\n\nAt the heart of the issue are two acronyms: TPP and TPA. Both of these acronyms are coming to a head, which is why the fight is beginning to become so bitter. The issue could linger as a headache for Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary, as the pro-labor side of the party tries to push her to the left.\n\nThe first acronym, TPP, represents the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed trade agreement featuring 12 countries, including the United States, Mexico, Japan, Canada, and Australia. The deal, which would open the door to free trade among the countries, is in the final stages of negotiation.\n\nTPA stands for \u201cTrade Promotion Authority,\u201d which is legislation that would smooth the path for Obama to directly negotiate with his counterparts in other countries. The so-called \u201cfast track\u201d legislation would, in essence, allow the president to bring the trade agreement to Congress for an up-or-down vote. It wouldn\u2019t allow Congress to amend the deal.\n\nObama and his unusual allies in the Republican Party have argued that \u201cfast track\u201d authority is necessary for the deal to be completed. After all, that would mean the 11 other countries privy to the deal would be, in essence, negotiating with not only the administration, but also with 535 members of Congress.\n\nRepublican members of Congress have argued that TPA is actually the best method for Congress to approve of any final trade deal.\n\n\u201cIt will ensure the timely and efficient implementation of trade agreements, and give our negotiators leverage to break down barriers to boost exports and wages,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said last week. \u201cAnd, notably, TPA will strengthen Congress\u2019s authority by clearly defining negotiating objectives and spelling out a detailed oversight and consultation process to achieve a final agreement.\u201d\n\nWho else supports TPP and TPA?\n\nObama has been one of the initiative\u2019s biggest supporters. And as Ian Bremmer, the president of the global risk firm Eurasia Group, pointed out, his administration has lobbied Congress on the initiative harder than anything aside from perhaps the Affordable Care Act and the Iran nuclear negotiations.\n\nObama argued last week that a vote against the TPP is essentially a vote for the status quo. He also said it would allow China to gain a competitive advantage in the Asian markets, which he said are the \u201cfastest-growing\u201d in the world.\n\n\u201cI will just repeat that 95 percent of the world\u2019s markets are outside our borders,\u201d Obama said in a press conference. \u201cThe fastest-growing markets, the most populous markets are going to be in Asia. And if we do not help to shape the rules so that our businesses and our workers can compete in those markets, then China will set up rules that advantage Chinese workers and Chinese businesses.\u201d\n\nObama has some unusual de-facto allies in this fight: Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Paul Ryan, and even Texas Sen. and presidential candidate Ted Cruz.\n\nThe most key Democrat to support the deal is Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee. It\u2019s not clear yet if House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi or any of her top lieutenants will offer their support. So far, Pelosi has been cautious in her statements on the issue. There\u2019s one key ally Obama can\u2019t count on in this debate, however.\n\n\u201cI have never, ever supported a trade agreement, and I\u2019m not going to start now,\u201d Reid, the Senate Minority Leader, told reporters on Tuesday. \u201cSo the answer is not only no, but hell no.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s it mean for 2016?\n\nAs the campaign starts heating up, the debate over the TPP and \u201cfast track\u201d authority will likely become heated in the Democratic primary.\n\nAs secretary of state, Clinton called the TPP \u2014 as it was being negotiated then \u2014 the potential \u201cgold standard\u201d of trade agreements. But her campaign has shifted that stance in recent days, saying the deal will have to pass a number of tests before it can earn her support.\n\n\u201cAny trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security,\u201d Clinton said of the negotiations during a campaign stop on Tuesday.\n\nLiberals and pro-union groups are very much against the deal. And they have allies in potential candidates like former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who is considering a run as a Democrat.\n\nO\u2019Malley seems to have found an opening to attack Clinton as he weighs a primary challenge to her. On Tuesday, he released a video on his opposition to the TPP. In a tweet, he also said opposing it shouldn\u2019t be a \u201chard choice,\u201d a not-so-subtle reference to the title of Clinton\u2019s latest memoir.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=1462067892199", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "description": "Harry Reid.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Fusion", "description": "Harry Reid.", "title": "Why Obama Is Going to War With Elizabeth Warren and Other Democrats", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/124373/tpp-tpa-trade-deal-obama-warren-hillary/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/147173340.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=80&strip=all", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Harry Reid.", "title": "Why Obama is going to war with Elizabeth Warren and other Democrats", "url": "http://fusion.net/story/124373/tpp-tpa-trade-deal-obama-warren-hillary/", "image": "http://i1.wp.com/fusion.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/147173340.jpg?resize=560%2C294&quality=80&strip=all", "site": "@fusion", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Fusion.net", "pocket-site-verification": "81a5587d6c56043280b2554922f43d", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6a5260d31ead375c331934cb6df4833"}, "fb": {"app_id": 796694167041552}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://fusion.net/wp-content/themes/fusion-theme/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=1462067892199", "application-name": "Fusion.net", "msvalidate.01": "0EABD001D404EA9DDE2025E9E4F14CAF", "google-site-verification": "BKw_9qDU04u2w1WoNF53fplAwWXVK_DJ1b6rZDR5u-M", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Politics,Elections"}, "article_summary": "Republican members of Congress have argued that TPA is actually the best method for Congress to approve of any final trade deal.\n\u201cAny trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security,\u201d Clinton said of the negotiations during a campaign stop on Tuesday.\nThe Democratic infighting has opened up comparisons to the Republican Party\u2019s \u201ccivil war\u201d over the past few years.\nReid gave Obama a quick \u201chell no\u201d when asked by reporters if he supported the deal.\n\u201cI will just repeat that 95 percent of the world\u2019s markets are outside our borders,\u201d Obama said in a press conference."}
