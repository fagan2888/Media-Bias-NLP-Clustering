Mike VanDeWalle, her opponent, received 41 percent, according to the Travis County clerk's office.\n\n\"This race is a sign of where Texans are headed,\" Israel said Tuesday.\n\nShe will succeed former state Rep. Mark Strama, D-Austin, who vacated the seat last year when he took a job with Google Fiber. She will serve the remainder of Strama's term before facing re-election in November. Both Israel and VanDeWalle have filed to run again.\n\nIsrael, a lesbian, will join state Rep. Mary Gonz\u00e1lez, D-Clint, as state legislators who identify as LGBT.\n\nHer campaign received support from organizers with Battleground Texas, a group focused on registering more Democratic voters and turning them out for the party\u2019s candidates. In a statement, Battleground Texas called Israel's victory the \"first of many to come.\"\n\nThe election results reflect ballots cast during early voting last week and between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Tuesday. They do not include provisional ballots cast Tuesday evening between 7 and 8 p.m. Election officials approved an hourlong extension at polling sites after Tuesday morning's inclement weather in Central Texas forced several area school districts to close.\n\nEarly voting in the district was saw a paltry 4.5 percent turnout. And icy weather on election day prompted closures of eight of the district's 36 polling places.\n\nWhile turnout was low Tuesday morning, it picked up later in the day, a representative for the Travis County clerk's office said. The runoff ultimately had an 11 percent turnout.\n\nIt followed a November special election in which VanDeWalle took first place, with 39 percent of the vote, and Israel took second, with 32 percent, ahead of two other Democrats.\n\nOriginal story:\n\nFor voters in North Austin and part of Pflugerville, it\u2019s election day. Again.\n\nBut freezing temperatures could keep many voters at home during the special election runoff for House District 50. That makes the contest, the state's first legislative election this year, all the more heated.\n\nDemocrat Celia Israel and Republican Mike VanDeWalle face off Tuesday in a runoff for the seat vacated by Democrat Mark Strama. The winner will serve the remainder of Strama's term before a rematch in November. Polls are scheduled to be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.\n\nVanDeWalle, the lone Republican in the special election, finished first in a four-way race in November with 39 percent of the vote. Israel placed second with 32 percent, emerging as the top Democratic candidate of three.\n\nPolitical observers have keenly watched the race for Strama\u2019s seat, which he left last year to take a job with Google Fiber. Republicans see VanDeWalle\u2019s candidacy as an opportunity to turn a blue seat red, while Democratic groups like Battleground Texas have backed Israel as part of a statewide effort to grow their base.\n\nTurnout during early voting was extraordinarily low. Just 4.5 percent of eligible voters cast early ballots in the election \u2014 about half as many as in the last special election runoff in Travis County, according to the county clerk\u2019s office.\n\nSupporters of both campaigns have acknowledged the awkward timing of both early voting and election day. Early voting began last Tuesday, one day after the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, and ended Friday, when polls opened five hours late because of icy weather.\n\nMeteorologists predict icy conditions with a low of 25 degrees in Austin on Tuesday, which could lead to further voting delays.\n\nA chiropractor in North Austin, VanDeWalle has billed himself as a conservative opposed to government regulation and the Affordable Care Act. Representatives for his campaign did not respond on Monday to requests for comment, but Rosemary Edwards, chairwoman of the Travis County Republican Party, called VanDeWalle a \u201cfriend to small business\u201d with \u201cstrong conservative principles.\u201d\n\nIsrael, who got her political start working for former Gov. Ann Richards, said her focus on funding public education resonated with voters in the district, 61 percent of whom cast their ballots for a Democrat in the first special election. The challenge, she said, was not persuading voters, but getting them to the polls.\n\n\u201cSupport for public education, that\u2019s the No. 1 issue at the door,\u201d Israel said. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019ve got the more energized campaign.\"\n\nLow voter turnout makes the race\u2019s outcome more difficult to predict, both Republicans and Democrats said.\n\nJoe Deshotel, a spokesman for the Travis County Democratic Party, said the runoff election would be a first test for the Democratic Party\u2019s infrastructure before November. The county party will host a fundraiser Tuesday evening featuring Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Wendy Davis as a keynote speaker. Deshotel said he was confident that he could announce Israel\u2019s victory at the fundraiser, \u201cand Battleground will be able to claim one of their very first victories to help push Wendy across the line.\u201d\n\nEdwards praised VanDeWalle\u2019s campaign as a true grass-roots effort within HD-50 and said the involvement of Battleground Texas in Israel\u2019s campaign \u201cshows desperation.\u201d\n\nFor both candidates, Tuesday\u2019s special election is a preface to a larger showdown in November. Each has filed to run again for a full term in 2014, in what is likely to be a higher-profile contest. But Tuesday\u2019s winner will have the advantage of incumbency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to really depend on turnout,\u201d Edwards said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "UPDATED:&nbsp;Democrat&nbsp;Celia Israel&nbsp;defeated Republican&nbsp;Mike VanDeWalle&nbsp;on Tuesday in a special election runoff for House District 50.
