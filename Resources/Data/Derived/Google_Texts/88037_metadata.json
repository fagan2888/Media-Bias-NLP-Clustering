(Reuters/Lucy Nicholson)\n\nHere\u2019s one way to measure the impact of smartphone-enabled on-demand service platforms: Less than seven years after the founding of the largest company in the space, Uber, Washington is buzzing with talk of how to overhaul labor law to fit the new category of workers it claims to have created.\n\nThat might seem like a long time. But the main corpus of regulations governing the work experience hasn\u2019t changed substantially for more than 60 years, so for broad reform proposals to be circulating at this point is basically warp speed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult for government to keep up,\u201d says former Domestic Policy Council chairman Bruce Reed, who\u2019s been tapped by the Aspen Institute to run an Initiative on the Future of Work. \"This issue will be an interesting clash of the can-do mentality of Silicon Valley with the 'let\u2019s not and say we did' mentality of Washington.\u201d\n\nWithin a year, the Aspen outfit expects to have some ideas for how things should change to protect the not-quite-employees-not-quite-contractors in the on-demand or \u201cgig\u201d economy, while not constraining the growth of services that consumers seem to love. They\u2019re kicking off next week with a discussion of the \u201cportable benefits\u201d idea raised last month by a collection of tech executives and worker advocates looking to provide safety net services to people who hop from employer to employer.\n\nMeanwhile, this Thursday the Department of Labor will convene a \u201cFuture of Work Symposium\u201d in Washington to discuss how the government ought to adapt to new forms of employment relationships. The day before that, the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution plans to host a morning of panels to discuss a new paper on the subject by President Obama's former Council of Economic Advisors chairman Alan Krueger and Seth Harris, a lawyer who served briefly as U.S. Secretary of Labor in 2013.\n\nAll of the activity is motivated by a sense that, although infinitesimal right now \u2014 the number of people working through online intermediaries in the United States is estimated at 600,000 \u2014 the category could grow exponentially. Courts have been all over the map in deciding whether those Uber drivers and Handy cleaners are really employees or independent contractors, with on-demand companies insisting that their business models would be toast if they had to treat them as the latter.\n\nAlready, those who are plugged into this debate have separated into camps. There are those, found mostly among the labor union-oriented left, who believe that most of these workers are being misclassified as independent contractors and ought to receive all the benefits and protections of employeehood \u2014 workers compensation, tax withholding, contributions to social security, unemployment insurance, overtime, minimum wage, etc. To even talk about creating a new category for the on-demand economy is at best a distraction from the real problems most workers face.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what it is about the technology that can\u2019t be successfully deployed through an employment relationship,\u201d says Craig Becker, general counsel of the AFL-CIO. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say that companies of the size that some of these are, with all their savvy, couldn\u2019t provide the value which they\u2019re clearly providing, and still comply with what are the minimal obligations of U.S. employment law.\u201d\n\nAnd then there are those, like the conservative R Street Institute, that want to to create a \u201csafe harbor\u201d for on-demand companies to experiment with offering employment-like benefits without having to convert their workers over to employee status \u2014 essentially freeing them from regulation entirely. \u201cWe believe employer-employee relations should be defined by individual contract, rather that relying on statutory, regulatory and common law definitions,\u201d writes the Institute\u2019s director Ian Adams.\n\nInto this ferment steps Harris and Krueger, two former college buddies who\u2019ve been talking about how to update labor law for a while now. (Krueger co-authored a study with Uber\u2019s data a year ago that described how workers typically use the platform.) They approached the Hamilton Project about putting together a policy proposal earlier this year, and this week have produced something that has a little bit for both sides. The paper outlines a new category of \u201cindependent workers,\u201d operating through either online or offline \u201cintermediaries,\u201d who would be entitled some of the benefits and protections of employees \u2014 but not all.\n\n\u201cCompared to the status quo, they are required to pay most of the benefits that traditional employers provide,\u201d Krueger says of the intermediaries, \"except for the ones that don\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nSo, for example: Anti-discrimination laws would be extended to cover independent workers, who would also be allowed to unionize (independent contractors are currently barred from doing so). Intermediaries would be required to provide tax withholding, pay payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare, and contribute to support health insurance subsidies on the exchanges set up by the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIntermediaries would not, however, be required to offer workers compensation; instead they would be allowed to do so through insurance pools in exchange for immunity from lawsuits without running the risk of having to reclassify their workers as employees. They also wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the hours-based costs like overtime pay and unemployment insurance, since intermediaries never explicitly set schedules for their workers.\n\n\u201cAt its core, being an employee means the worker gives over to the employer control over hours of work, in exchange for a modicum of economic security,\u201d says Harris. \"An independent worker fundamentally doesn\u2019t do that.\"\n\nStill, some worry that existing employers will fashion themselves as intermediaries in order to lessen their regulatory burden.\n\n\u201cWe think developing a whole new category of workers, especially to respond to what is a tiny part of the labor market, would engender a race by other businesses to reclassify their workers in order to avoid accountability,\u201d says Rebecca Smith, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project.\n\nIn response to an outline of the paper, Lyft declined to comment on the record, and Uber sent a short statement saying \u201cwe look forward to continuing this discussion with policymakers, experts, and most importantly the people who use Uber to make money and improve their lives.\u201d Krueger notes that, in a workshop session where they solicited feedback from interested parties, representatives from on-demand platforms also weren\u2019t happy, particularly about parts of the proposal that would allow workers to collectively bargain.\n\n\u201cWe think we\u2019ve perfectly found no-man\u2019s land,\u201d Krueger joked. \"We in the Obama administration were great at crafting the exact policy that gets all the tradeoffs right and makes nobody happy.\u201d\n\nActual legislative language is likely still a long ways away. But any legislator who might like to offer it is getting a lot more to work with.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New proposals start dropping in the debate over how to protect the people who power the \"Uber for X\" economy.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "New proposals start dropping in the debate over how to protect the people who power the \"Uber for X\" economy.", "title": "This is what the social safety net could look like for on-demand workers", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/07/this-is-what-the-social-safety-net-could-look-like-for-on-demand-workers/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2015-07-15/Reuters/2015-07-15T213246Z_01_LUC01_RTRIDSP_3_USA-UBER.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/07/this-is-what-the-social-safety-net-could-look-like-for-on-demand-workers/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Post Keywords", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Post Keywords"}, "article_summary": "To even talk about creating a new category for the on-demand economy is at best a distraction from the real problems most workers face.\n(Krueger co-authored a study with Uber\u2019s data a year ago that described how workers typically use the platform.)\nThe paper outlines a new category of \u201cindependent workers,\u201d operating through either online or offline \u201cintermediaries,\u201d who would be entitled some of the benefits and protections of employees \u2014 but not all.\nThey also wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the hours-based costs like overtime pay and unemployment insurance, since intermediaries never explicitly set schedules for their workers.\nBut any legislator who might like to offer it is getting a lot more to work with."}
