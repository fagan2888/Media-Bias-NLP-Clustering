He was arrested within minutes at his workplace, Wingnut Auto Salon, on Old Dairy Road.\n\nJPD spokeswoman Erann Kalwara said she doubts David A. Whisenant, 29, knew he was a wanted man, or he probably wouldn\u2019t have called in.\n\n\u201cHe probably didn\u2019t recognize that he had this outstanding extraditable no-bail warrant,\u201d she said in an interview Thursday.\n\nThe warrant was issued in August 2011 by the Washington State Department of Corrections after Whisenant failed to report for community supervision, which is akin to probation, according to Washington DOC spokeswoman Norah West.\n\nWhisenant had pleaded guilty to possessing a controlled substance in Thurston County in central Washington near Olympia in 2010 and was sentenced to serve 30 days in jail and a year of supervision after his release, plus pay legal fees and surcharges, according to a legal assistant with the Thurston County Prosecutor\u2019s Office.\n\nA month after Whisenant was sentenced in that case on Sept. 16, 2010, he was extradited to Alaska to be in custody at Lemon Creek Correctional Center in Juneau as a federal inmate, West said. Then, he was extradited to Pierce County Jail in Washington in connection to another case, she said.\n\nAt some point, he was also a material witness in a federal case in Juneau and was not allowed to leave Alaska, West said. More information about the federal cases was not available by press time Thursday, and federal prosecutors could not be reached for comment.\n\nIt appears that with all the legal proceedings in the different cases, Whisenant didn\u2019t realize he still owed supervision time and money to the state of Washington.\n\n\u201cHe was supposed to report to the Olympia field office (for supervision intake) on Aug. 2, 2011,\u201d West said. \u201cThat just never happened. He just never showed up for supervision.\u201d\n\nWhile the Washington DOC renewed the warrant every year, Whisenant has been a law-abiding citizen in Juneau. He is a homeowner with wife and kids, he told the judge during his arraignment in Juneau District Court on Wednesday.\n\nWhisenant did not contest his extradition, and he will be extradited back to Washington later this month. Until then, Judge Keith Levy ordered him to stay in custody at Lemon Creek Correctional Center without bail.\n\n\u2022 Contact reporter Emily Russo Miller at 523-2263 or at emily.miller@juneauempire.com.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Juneau, newspaper, news, legislature, capital, Mendenhall, Douglas, southeast, Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, Mendenhall Glacier, Auke Bay, Salmon Creek, Lemon Creek, Switzer Creek, Mendenhall Valley, Fritz Cove, Lynn Canal, Tee Harbor, Local, EMILY RUSSO MILLER, David A.
