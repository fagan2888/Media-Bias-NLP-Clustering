DETROIT (AP) - An ex-convict who spent 20 years in prison for second-degree murder has been sentenced to life in prison without parole in the fatal shooting of an Army veteran at a Detroit-area bus stop.

The Wayne County prosecutorâ€™s office says 50-year-old Malcolm Benson on Thursday was given the mandatory punishment for felony murder.

Benson was accused in September of robbing and killing 59-year-old Stanley Carter, who was waiting for a bus in Highland Park. Benson had released from prison in January 2015.

Relatives have said Carter was a former Army Ranger and had a black belt in karate.
