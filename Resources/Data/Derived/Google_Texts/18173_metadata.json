Rick Glazier, argued forcefully that the language of the bill is drawn in a very narrow fashion so as to protect whistle blowers and others who would expose wrongdoing or illegal activity. And indeed, the proposal includes references (both direct and indirect) to numerous anti-retaliation statutes and includes none of the criminal penalties that were present in previous \u201cag gag\u201d proposals.\n\nIt\u2019s also easy to envision compelling scenarios in which employers would be rightfully aggrieved at the idea of employees secretly recording and posting to the Internet the contents of, say, staff meetings or private strategy sessions.\n\nThat said, the bill as written still raises serious and nagging questions about freedom of speech and the public\u2019s right to know important information. For instance, it appears that under the terms of the bill, an employee who becomes aware of inhumane or unsanitary (but not necessarily illegal) food preparation practices could be sued, silenced and ordered to pay damages if she recorded a video of such practices on her phone and publicized the recording. Similarly, an office worker who, for instance, records and publicizes the fact that his boss keeps a noose in his office along with some racist posters and literature would appear to be potentially liable for damages.\n\nUnder the bill, liability would appear to hinge on the employee\u2019s intent in entering the \u201cnonpublic areas of an employer\u2019s premises.\u201d The bill specifies that if an employee enters for \u201ca reason other than a bona fide intent of seeking or holding employment or doing business with the employer\u201d he or she could be barred from sharing sounds, images and other information obtained.\n\nThough not completely clear, this presumably means that if an employee works in the front office and enters the slaughterhouse solely for the purpose of gathering information that he or she has heard about, there could be trouble. If, on the other hand, the employee already works in the slaughterhouse and records activities there during the course of the regular day, he or she might conceivably be protected.\n\nThe problem, of course, with all this, is that defending oneself against such a lawsuit would almost assuredly be horrendously expensive and intimidating. An employee might conceivably \u201cwin\u201d such a case but still lose his or her shirt in paying lawyers and other costs of defending the case. Moreover, as a practical matter, it\u2019s easy to imagine how the mere threat of such a suit (particularly by some corporate giant) would be an enormously intimidating. How many average employees would be willing to take the risk of testing the matter under threat of being ruined financially for life?\n\nThe bottom line: Crafting a statute that protects legitimate property rights when they are competing against the First Amendment\u2019s free speech guarantees and the flow of information in a free society is an enormously complex and difficult proposition. Perhaps there is some reasonable point at which the two competing interests are properly balanced, but then again, perhaps such a balancing point really doesn\u2019t exist. Let\u2019s hope, at a minimum, that sponsors of the bill continue to fine tune the language with an eye toward finding that point and that, if they can\u2019t do so, they opt for language that errs on the side of free speech. The current version isn\u2019t there yet.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5ec\"", "article_summary": "That said, the bill as written still raises serious and nagging questions about freedom of speech and the public\u2019s right to know important information.\nAnd indeed, the proposal includes references (both direct and indirect) to numerous anti-retaliation statutes and includes none of the criminal penalties that were present in previous \u201cag gag\u201d proposals.\nHow many average employees would be willing to take the risk of testing the matter under threat of being ruined financially for life?\nThe problem, of course, with all this, is that defending oneself against such a lawsuit would almost assuredly be horrendously expensive and intimidating.\nAn employee might conceivably \u201cwin\u201d such a case but still lose his or her shirt in paying lawyers and other costs of defending the case."}
