Could you afford to retire, care for ailing parents, or reinvent your medical practice?\n\nWealth buys the freedom to decide how you spend your days. My investments gave me the safety net to leave my conventional surgical practice and launch into a career as an author and speaker and consultant promoting better medical outcomes.\n\nHere\u2019s the dirty little secret. Most physicians are economic slaves to their practices. Our high incomes do not reliably translate to high net worth and the freedom wealth buys.\n\nIncome vs Wealth\n\nPracticing physicians earn top dollars. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics culled data from tax records to conclude that nine of the top 10 earners in the US call themselves \u201cdoctor.\u201d\n\nIndirect evidence supports the assertion that physicians fail to build wealth. In a recent survey, half of physicians are behind where they would like to be in retirement planning. Professional medical associations are exploring how to assess competency in older physicians who continue to practice because they cannot afford to retire.\n\nThe Reasons Physicians Fail to Build Wealth\n\nWhat keeps physicians from building wealth? Here are the reasons usually cited:\n\nMedical school debt\n\nLate start on earning and savings\n\nFailure to protect assets against know and overlooked risks\n\nPoor tax planning\n\nGetting investment advice from the wrong people\n\nFraud and theft\n\nThis is like saying patients become obese because they eat too many donuts. It may be true, but it fails to tell the whole story.\n\nFurther it fails to lead to sustained solutions that deliver different outcomes. Budgets work about as well as diets.\n\nThe Real Causes of Unrealized Wealth\n\nI believe that physicians\u2019 failure to build wealth is a symptom of a deeper financial ill: their dysfunctional relationship with money.\n\nPhysicians as a group are intelligent people who:\n\nTend to overestimate their ability to manage money, and underestimate the level of difficulty of the challenge.\n\nLack insight about what they do and do not know.\n\nTurn to money to solve non-financial problems, like alleviating their guilt about spending so little time with their families.\n\nThe real barrier to financial freedom comes down to a conspiracy of silence around money. For physicians, money is the ultimate taboo topic. You cannot fix problems that you cannot talk about.\n\nHere are three reasons physicians avoid conversations about money:\n\nThe culture of medicine. Just as the government calls for the separation of church and state, medical ethics calls for a separation between the care a patient gets and a patient\u2019s ability to pay. We physicians learn to avoid conversations about money to uphold this ethic. As a practicing physician I often thought that delivering medical services was like ordering a meal off of a restaurant menu without any prices. Small wonder health care costs spiraled out of control!\n\nLack of formal education. Physicians get no courses in business or financial management in medical school or in residency.\n\nAwareness of their vulnerability. Physicians experience themselves as financial prey. They turn to people they trust\u2013their colleagues\u2013for financial advice. I include myself in the group of physicians who have fallen for \u201cDDD\u2019s\u201d\u2013dumb doctor deals.\n\nThe Path to Wealth\n\nPhysicians have the ability to build wealth.\n\nAs Einstein says, problems are not solved on the level at which they are created. The solution begins with physicians\u2019 willingness to tolerate the discomfort when discussing money.\n\nHere are three steps to help physicians achieve financial freedom:\n\n1. Coach physicians to proactively engage in conversations with patients about the costs of medical care.\n\n2. Explore\u2013with compassion\u2013the forces that drive spending. Here are some things that struggling physicians say to themselves.\n\n\u201cI deserve nice things.\u201d You know the sacrifices you and your family made to answer this call to medical service. When physicians finally start earning their six-figure incomes, they feel that it\u2019s time to splurge.\n\n\u201cI can save lives and I\u2019m smart; that means I can manage my own money.\u201d You cannot see into your blind spot.\n\n\u201cThere will always be more than enough money. \u201d This physician fails to plan, trusting that there will be a bright financial future. Without a plan, money tends to wander off.\n\n\u201cYou invested in a marijuana farm with a 200% return? Count me in!\u201d Physicians can follow trusted colleagues into marginal investments.\n\n\u201cLook at me!\u201d This physician wants to maintain the appearance of success at the cost of building true wealth.\n\n\u201cSure, I trust you.\u201d Physicians\u2019 trusting nature makes them easy targets for embezzlement, fraud and ploys.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed.\u201d Many physicians wonder how smart people like themselves could make such ill-informed choices. Disclosing mistakes can be painful.\n\n\u201cMother Teresa took a vow to poverty; I should, too.\u201d This physician does not feel worthy of wealth.\n\n\u201cShow me where to sign.\u201d Physicians are often unaware of their power to negotiate contracts, or lack the skill and experience to execute.\n\n3. Replace wealth-eroding beliefs and habits with new wealth-building tools and skills. Just as we have mentors to guide us through the art and science of caring for patients, mentors and coaches helped me change my beliefs and behaviors around money. I offer my son\u2013headed for medical school\u2013basic financial literacy lessons I never got. I hope he aligns his spending habits with Einstein\u2019s insight, \u201cCompound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn\u2019t pays it.\u201d\n\nWealth-building is not a do-it-yourself job for most physicians. If you or a family member had a rare medical condition, you would not treat it yourself; you would seek the help of the expert. Manage your wealth with the same strategies you use when you manage your health.\n\nFinancial advisors know about the complexities of \u201creferred financial pain\u201d the same way you know about the association of right shoulder pain and an inflamed gallbladder. Could you acquire this knowledge? Absolutely. The real question is whether you want to invest the time and effort.\n\nPhysicians can achieve financial freedom.
