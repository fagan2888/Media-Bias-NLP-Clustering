Greenback, which provides specialized expat tax services and consulting for thousands of Americans living overseas, is conducting the survey in cooperation with the American Citizens Abroad Global Foundation (ACAGF). The 2015 survey seeks to gather important information from US expats about filing US taxes, US government representation, renouncing citizenship, Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and other US tax and expat lifestyle issues.\n\n\"Our goal is to provide expats with an opportunity to voice their opinions on US taxes, expat lifestyles overseas and the global tax issues that impact them most,\" said David McKeegan, Co-President and Co-Founder of Greenback Expat Tax Services. \"Gaining a better understanding of their opinions about US tax compliance and culture gives all US expats a stronger platform to be heard, providing a voice to the estimated 7.6 million Americans living abroad.\"\n\nThe 2015 US Expat Opinion Survey was created in cooperation with the ACAGF, a section 501(c)(3) charitable organization working principally on educational matters to promote the interests of Americans living abroad. According to Marylouise Serrato, Executive Director American Citizens Abroad, Inc., a \"sister\" section 501(c)(4) organization, the survey responses are critical for helping them represent the best interests of these US citizens.\n\n\"When we meet with legislators and other officials on behalf of US expats, we need to know what is most important to them and how these issues impact their lives abroad,\" says Serrato. \"We encourage US expats to complete the survey, as less than 4 minutes of their time will give us needed insights to their experiences.\"\n\nThe brief survey asks expats about a variety of critical tax issues, such as FBAR (Foreign Bank Account Reporting), Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and the new act, FATCA. FATCA, which went into effect last year, is designed to identify American taxpayers who are hiding assets abroad in order to avoid US taxes. Foreign financial institutions are being required to report on the accounts of their American clients. There are reports of some banks refusing to work with Americans in order to avoid FATCA's detailed reporting requirements, causing serious financial issues for US expats.\n\nExpats can complete the survey right here.\n\nUS expats who complete Greenback's survey receive $25 off their 2014 Federal Tax Return preparation. To receive the discount, participants simply complete the survey and register between March 2nd, 2015 and April 20th, 2015 and complete their return by May 20th, 2015.\n\nIf you are a journalist and interested in receiving the results to this survey to share with your readers, please contact us at info@greenbacktaxservices.com.\n\n###\n\nMore About Greenback US Expat Tax Services\n\nGreenback Expat Tax Services specializes in the preparation of US expat taxes for Americans living abroad.
