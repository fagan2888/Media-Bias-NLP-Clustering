The U.S. economy appears to be on the cusp of a breakout from the sluggish pace recorded over the past few years. The YPO Global Pulse index of CEO sentiment, which aggregates the forecasts of thousands of business leaders on the front lines of the economy, revealed in its January 2014 poll of YPO members that business confidence in the United States surged to its highest level since April 2012.

As an active Young Presidents' Organization member and the CEO of Customers Bancorp, I have followed the YPO Global Pulse for years now, and this is not the first time I've seen the index indicate increased optimism early in the year, only to fade away as the year progresses. However, several signs support my belief that this year may be different and that the optimism we're seeing today will translate into accelerated growth in 2014.
