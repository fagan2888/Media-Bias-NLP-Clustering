Importantly, WHD provides a platform to mobilize greater support for our continued work toward better surveillance and prevention programs and improved access to diagnosis and treatment, through focused governmental and nongovernmental action. Globally, over 400 million people are living with viral hepatitis, and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that over 1.4 million people around the world die each year as a result of viral hepatitis. WHO focuses attention on World Hepatitis Day as one of the 8 official global health campaigns mandated by WHO Member States. We are honored to join in this annual global observance.\n\nIn the U.S., the Action Plan for the Prevention, Care, and Treatment of Viral Hepatitis recognizes that chronic viral hepatitis is largely preventable and treatable. And in the case of hepatitis C, the infection is curable. Still, it\u2019s estimated that between 3.5 and 5.3 million Americans are living with untreated chronic viral hepatitis, which is a leading cause of liver cancer and the most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2013 there were over 21,000 deaths in the U.S. related to hepatitis A, B, and C. But we don\u2019t have to accept these numbers. We can fight back. Using the Action Plan as a roadmap, federal and nonfederal stakeholders are taking steps to expand and strengthen programs, services, and research activities that will enhance our response to viral hepatitis. Raising awareness of viral hepatitis among the public at large as well as healthcare providers through events such as World Hepatitis Day is an important component of this enhanced response.\n\nThere are many ways to learn more about and get involved in efforts to address viral hepatitis.\n\nView Live Webcast of U.S. Federal Observance of World Hepatitis Day\n\nTune into the Live Webcast on National Efforts to Address Viral Hepatitis\n\nTuesday July 28th, 10:00 AM \u2013 12:30 PM (EDT)\n\nWorking Together to Improve Viral Hepatitis Outcomes in the U.S. \u2013\n\nA World Hepatitis Day Observance\n\nThis event will be webcast at www.hhs.gov/live-2\n\nJoin us and learn about the efforts being undertaken across the nation to address hepatitis B and hepatitis C.
