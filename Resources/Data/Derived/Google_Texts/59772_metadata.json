That\u2019s what the American Medical Association says. That\u2019s what the American Psychiatric Association says. That\u2019s what the National Institute of Drug Abuse in the National Institutes of Health says.\n\n\u201cAddiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry,\u201d according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine. Dysfunction in these parts of the brain results in \u201ccharacteristic biological, psychological, social and spiritual manifestations.\u201d\n\nAs death from opiate overdose strikes more Maine families, the demand for the state to do something grows stronger. But despite strong scientific consensus that addiction is a treatable disease, there is still significant political controversy over whether it should be battled by police or by doctors.\n\nWe have said before that the right approach is not either but both, and we support the framework proposed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, which would devote new resources to law enforcement as well as to expand treatment options.\n\nBut even within the treatment proposal outlined earlier this month, there remains a stubborn tendency to treat opioid addiction as bad behavior and not a brain disorder. If this attitude doesn\u2019t change before the bill becomes law, Maine will have missed an important opportunity to save lives.\n\nAs currently conceived, there is $5 million of state funds to be spent on the opiate crisis, but no additional money for what decades of experience and research have shown to be the most effective way to treat this disease \u2014 with medicine.\n\nMethadone, the most effective treatment for opiate addiction ever devised, is not on the list. Neither is Suboxone, a similar medication that doesn\u2019t have to be distributed in clinics. Instead, there is a focus on residential treatment and peer support \u2014 approaches that do not have the same track record of success in treating opiate addiction.\n\nWhy? Because too many people still treat opiate addiction as a choice that can be combated only with willpower.\n\nThe consensus of the medical community is that they are wrong.\n\nOpiates block pain and anxiety, and, in high doses, produce euphoria. Over time, the chemicals change the brain\u2019s structure, so that long-term users often report craving them just to feel \u201cnormal.\u201d Once dependent, users will go through painful withdrawal symptoms that many find intolerable.\n\nAt this stage, some will do anything to get more drugs, which leads them to a variety of criminal behaviors including drug dealing, prostitution and robbery. The addict needs progressively higher doses to experience the desired effect, sometimes leading to overdosing and death.\n\nMethadone is a medicine designed to combat the illness. It is a long-acting opioid that prevents withdrawal and blocks cravings. With a single daily dose (a heroin addict may need four doses a day), a methadone patient doesn\u2019t get \u201chigh,\u201d and can pursue a normal life. That means that they can hold a job and receive treatment for other underlying mental illnesses, which may have contributed to their addiction. While in treatment, the patients live longer, commit fewer crimes and have a lower rate of infectious diseases, such as AIDS, that are spread through the use of dirty needles and unsafe sex.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect. Some patients cheat and continue to take illicit drugs, but after a half-century of tracking its use, methadone has a better record of success than any treatment for any kind of drug or alcohol addiction, according to a report by the Harvard Medical School.\n\nStill it remains politically controversial, because of the insistence that drug addiction is a moral weakness. The addicts chose to take drugs, the argument goes, so they should suffer the consequences.\n\nBut we don\u2019t consider diabetics to be immoral for taking insulin, or people with heart disease for taking cholesterol-lowering medicines \u2014 even though those conditions could have been brought on by unhealthy eating.\n\nOpiate addiction is also a chronic disease that can\u2019t usually be treated with behavior modification alone. We know that people respond well to medication, and it is wrong for lawmakers to make that form of treatment unavailable for reasons that don\u2019t have a scientific basis.\n\nWhen lawmakers begin work on the opiate response bill next month, getting medication-supported treatment to the people who need it should be a top priority.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In spite of overwhelming evidence, many people still believe opioid addiction is bad behavior, not a brain disorder.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "In spite of overwhelming evidence, many people still believe opioid addiction is bad behavior, not a brain disorder.", "title": "OUR OPINION: Medicine part of treatment for addiction - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/460324_3edit_OurOpinionMS-KJ_250px.jpg", "height": 911}, "updated_time": "2015-12-18T16:47:55-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/12/20/our-opinion-medicine-part-of-treatment-for-addiction/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/460324_3edit_OurOpinionMS-KJ_250px.jpg", "description": "In spite of overwhelming evidence, many people still believe opioid addiction is bad behavior, not a brain disorder.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "OUR OPINION: Medicine part of treatment for addiction - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Editorials", "tag": "ouropinion", "published_time": "2015-12-20T04:10:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-18T16:47:55-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce3d4\"", "article_summary": "Because too many people still treat opiate addiction as a choice that can be combated only with willpower.\n\u201cAddiction is a primary, chronic disease of brain reward, motivation, memory and related circuitry,\u201d according to the American Society of Addiction Medicine.\nMethadone, the most effective treatment for opiate addiction ever devised, is not on the list.\nStill it remains politically controversial, because of the insistence that drug addiction is a moral weakness.\nInstead, there is a focus on residential treatment and peer support \u2014 approaches that do not have the same track record of success in treating opiate addiction."}
