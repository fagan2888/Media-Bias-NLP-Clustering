Plan members with HIV faced coinsurance as high as 50%, resulting in almost $1,000 in monthly drug costs, according to the AIDS Institute. However, effective June 1 , almost all HIV drugs across all of Aetna's exchange plans nationwide will be placed into lower-cost generic or non-preferred tiers.The policy change will lower patient cost-sharing for HIV drugs to co-payments that range from $5 and $100, after deductibles are met, an Aetna spokeswoman said. Aetna also will consider revising drug lists for employer plans that don't already cover HIV drugs in lower-cost tiers.\u201cThis is a major victory for people living with HIV who rely on medications to remain healthy,\u201d said Carl Schmid, deputy executive director for the AIDS Institute.Aetna's decision comes several months after Cigna Corp. and Humana changed their prescription drug policies to lower cost-sharing on HIV drugs. However, Cigna's and Humana's changes applied only to their exchange plans in Florida. The AIDS Institute and the National Health Law Program filed a complaint with HHS last year against Aetna, Cigna, Humana and Preferred Medical, alleging their drug formularies discriminated against HIV patients.The CMS said in February that it will take a more critical approach to potentially discriminatory practices in the drug benefit designs of exchange plans in 2016. Insurers that place expensive drugs in tiers with high coinsurance or co-pays for members may have to justify their policy with regulators.\u201cHaving a specialty tier is not on its face discriminatory,\u201d the CMS said. \u201cHowever, placing most or all drugs for a certain condition on a high-cost tier without regard to the actual cost the issuer pays for the drug may often be discriminatory in application when looking at the totality of the circumstances, and therefore prohibited.\u201dThe harder stance from the CMS may have forced Aetna to make the drug formulary change before it files 2016 plans in the next couple months, Schmid said. But Aetna's change should be just a start, he said. More plans need to be held accountable for \u201ctrying to gouge the patients who rely on medications,\u201d Schmid said.Patients with hepatitis C and other diseases have similarly faced high prescription drug costs, even for generics \u201cIt shouldn't just be HIV drugs that they are doing this for,\u201d Schmid said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "Aetna has changed how HIV drugs are listed within health plans sold on the exchanges after consumer groups criticized the health insurer's policy as discriminatory.", "title": "Aetna revises HIV drug policy for all exchange plans", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "Aetna has changed how HIV drugs are listed within health plans sold on the exchanges after consumer groups criticized the health insurer's policy as discriminatory.", "title": "Aetna revises HIV drug policy for all exchange plans", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150327/news/150329914", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "Aetna has changed how HIV drugs are listed within health plans sold on the exchanges after consumer groups criticized the health insurer's policy as discriminatory.", "title": "Aetna revises HIV drug policy for all exchange plans", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20150327/news/150329914", "published_at": "2015-03-27", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda07d\"", "article_summary": "However, Cigna's and Humana's changes applied only to their exchange plans in Florida.\nPlan members with HIV faced coinsurance as high as 50%, resulting in almost $1,000 in monthly drug costs, according to the AIDS Institute.\nBut Aetna's change should be just a start, he said.\nInsurers that place expensive drugs in tiers with high coinsurance or co-pays for members may have to justify their policy with regulators.\u201cHaving a specialty tier is not on its face discriminatory,\u201d the CMS said.\nHowever, effective June 1 , almost all HIV drugs across all of Aetna's exchange plans nationwide will be placed into lower-cost generic or non-preferred tiers.The policy change will lower patient cost-sharing for HIV drugs to co-payments that range from $5 and $100, after deductibles are met, an Aetna spokeswoman said."}
