A wall of paper records had to go as did a lead wall in the old X-ray room.\n\nThe end result: Six exam rooms, cardiac imaging, a treadmill room, a telemedicine room, office and conference space.\n\nThe walls are painted periwinkle, and the waiting room features a mural of an ocean and child-size wooden chairs with ocean creature cutouts.\n\nTestorff lined up suppliers in advance for fixtures such as fluorescent lights that would ordinarily require a six-week lead time.\n\n\"None are off-the-shelf items,\" he said, noting the multistep process required for the medical-grade floor which has colorful insets of sand dollars and starfish.\n\nTestorff is working on a clinic for occupational medicine at 3601 Caldwell Drive in the Soquel Research Park.\n\nKaplan said he has seen a lot of changes among solo and small groups of doctors, some downsizing, some retiring, and some joining bigger practices as a result of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFollow Sentinel reporter Jondi Gumz at Twitter.com/jondigumz\n\nDominican Hospital will not close its rehab campus by Dec. 31, as announced earlier this year, EXTRA B2\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "CAPITOLA -- Aptos contractor Pete Testorff is putting the finishing touches on a $250,000 remodel for a state-of-the-art pediatric clinic to be operated by Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford.", "title": "Stanford to open pediatric specialty clinic", "og": {"url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/ZZ/20131215/NEWS/131217296", "image": {"width": "470px", "identifier": "http://local.santacruzsentinel.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/santacruzsentinel.png?052016", "height": "247px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Stanford to open pediatric specialty clinic"}, "twitter": {"domain": "santacruzsentinel.com", "description": "CAPITOLA -- Aptos contractor Pete Testorff is putting the finishing touches on a $250,000 remodel for a state-of-the-art pediatric clinic to be operated by Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford.", "title": "Stanford to open pediatric specialty clinic", "url": "http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/ZZ/20131215/NEWS/131217296", "image": {"src": "http://local.santacruzsentinel.com/common/dfm/assets/logos/small/santacruzsentinel.png?052016"}, "site": "@scsentinel", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563358177?mt=8", "iphone": "id499677382?mt=8", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.californianewspaperpartnership.santacruzsentinel"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "keywords": "News, Santa Cruz news, CA news, US news, world news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "News, Santa Cruz news, CA news, US news, world news."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1dbf\"", "article_summary": "Stanford Children's Health Specialty Services Capitola will offer oncology, pulmonology, neurology, cardiology, infectious disease, developmental pediatrics, follow-up for high-risk infants, and a foster care health program.\n\"Stanford was looking for a home in Santa Cruz County and we were lucky enough to be able to provide one,\" said landlord Doug Kaplan of Lomak Property.\nCapitola was \"a good location for health care access between Santa Cruz and Watsonville\" with \"excellent access to public transportation,\" according to Dicks.\nCAPITOLA -- Aptos contractor Pete Testorff is putting the finishing touches on a $250,000 remodel for a state-of-the-art pediatric clinic to be operated by Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford.\nTestorff is working on a clinic for occupational medicine at 3601 Caldwell Drive in the Soquel Research Park."}
