For some trips, it will be faster than flying \u2014 without the pat-down.\u201d\n\nBut as Mr. Obama\u2019s second term nears an end, some experts say the president\u2019s words were a fantasy.\n\n\u201cThe idea that we would have a high-speed system that 80 percent of Americans could access in that short period of time was unadulterated hype, and it didn\u2019t take an expert to see through it,\u201d said Kenneth Orski, the editor and publisher of an influential transportation newsletter who served in the Nixon and Ford administrations. \u201cAnd scattering money all around the country rather than focusing it on areas ripe for high-speed rail didn\u2019t help.\u201d\n\nThe Acela, introduced by Amtrak in 2000, was America\u2019s first successful high-speed train, and most days its cars are full. The train has reduced the time it takes to travel between Washington, New York and Boston, but aging tracks and bridges \u2014 including Baltimore\u2019s 100-year-old tunnel where trains come to a crawl \u2014 have slowed it down. It takes two hours and 45 minutes to travel from New York to Washington on the Acela. If the Acela were a bullet train traveling on new tracks, it would take 90 minutes.\n\nAnother problem is that Amtrak\u2019s funding is tied to annual appropriations from Congress, leaving it without a long-term source of money. \u201cI do what I can do,\u201d said Joseph Boardman, Amtrak\u2019s president. \u201cBut I don\u2019t sit back and wait for $15 billion to rebuild the Northeast Corridor.\u201d For now, Amtrak is rebuilding a stretch of track in central New Jersey that will permit travel at 160 m.p.h. for 23 miles.\n\nPhoto\n\nBut advocates say they are hopeful.\n\n\u201cOnce something gets built, then we\u2019re going to see more projects get going,\u201d said Ray LaHood, Mr. Obama\u2019s first transportation secretary. Mr. LaHood said it took the Interstate System of highways decades to be completed, and he predicts that high-speed rail will be the same.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. LaHood said California seemed the most likely candidate for success with high-speed rail, even though plans for a 520-mile train route between Los Angeles and San Francisco have been mired in controversy.\n\nDespite strong backing from Gov. Jerry Brown, a court ruling had tied up state bond funding for the $68 billion project. An appeals court on July 31 threw out that ruling, which had been based on a lawsuit. But opponents are still increasing calls to kill the project, and polls show waning public support for it.\n\nStill, California has begun construction of the tracks and put out bids for a vendor to build the trains. And the new rail project will get an infusion of funds from the state\u2019s cap-and-trade program, which requires business to pay for excess pollution.\n\n\u201cThe Golden Gate Bridge was tied up for years in hundreds of lawsuits,\u201d said Jeff Morales, executive director of the California High-Speed Rail Authority. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had quite that many.\u201d\n\nBut Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican and chairman of the House Transportation subcommittee on railroads, said the state should not be in the railroad business. \u201cHigh-speed rail can be a good idea; I just think it should be left up to the private sector,\u201d he said. Proposed projects in Texas and Florida, he added, were better models.\n\nIn Florida, a private company, All Aboard Florida, is planning a rail line in the wake of Gov. Rick Scott\u2019s cancellation of a state high-speed rail project in 2011. Trains are to reach speeds of about 125 m.p.h., although they will travel much slower on a proposed route between Miami and West Palm Beach, with a stop in Fort Lauderdale. A final leg to Orlando will begin in 2017, the company said.\n\nThe project will be privately financed, but builders have applied for a $1.5 billion loan from the Federal Railroad Administration. Although it must be paid back with interest over 25 years, with collateral deposited in the interim, critics have called it taxpayer funding. Several counties along the route have also passed resolutions opposing the project.\n\nIn Texas, another private company, the Texas Central Railway, has proposed building a high-speed rail line with trains that could reach speeds of up to 205 m.p.h., which could cut the trip between Houston and Dallas to 90 minutes. The Texas project will use the bullet trains popularized in Japan and is planned to open in 2021, said Richard Lawless, chairman and chief executive of Texas Central Railway.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Lawless said that the 240-mile Dallas to Houston route was ideal for high-speed rail and that it would make travel times between the two cities faster than by car and competitive with airlines. \u201cGiven the traffic, the growth occurring and the dynamics of the Texas economy, plus the movement between the two metro areas, the demand for this project is very substantial,\u201d Mr. Lawless said.\n\nStill, even if the California, Florida and Texas projects all succeed, transportation experts say it is unlikely that the United States will ever have the same kind of high-speed rail systems as China or Europe.\n\nC. William Ibbs, a professor of civil engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, said countries with successful high-speed rail projects had higher population densities, higher gas prices, higher rates of public-transportation use and lower rates of car ownership. \u201cSo it wouldn\u2019t make any sense to have a high-speed rail train in most areas of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cThe geography is different and other factors are just too different.\u201d\n\nBut Andy Kunz, executive director of the U.S. High-Speed Rail Association, thinks the United States will eventually have a high-speed rail system that connects the country. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some years after gas prices rise and highways fill up with traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen because we won\u2019t have a choice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140806100634, "twitter": {"description": "Although Republican opposition and community protests have
