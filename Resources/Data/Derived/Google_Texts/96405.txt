Republican Ryan Costello, a county commissioner, bested physician Manan Trivedi in the race for the U.S. House seat representing the district that begins in eastern Lebanon County, according to unofficial results from The Associated Press.

AP called the race for the 6th Congressional District in Costello's favor around 10 p.m.

According to the latest unofficial results available from the state as of shortly after 10 p.m. with 71 percent of votes counted, Costello had 80,460 votes, or 57 percent, to Trivedi's 61,317, or 43 percent.

Costello replaces Republican Jim Gerlach, who is retiring after six terms.

Costello, 38, a lawyer by profession, is chairman of the Chester County commissioners. During the campaign, he expressed a goal of ending gridlock and finding bipartisan solutions. The son of public school teachers, he said he favors fixing Obamacare rather than repealing it, while blaming Obamacare for rampant part-time jobs and underemployment.

Trivedi, 40, of Birdsboro in Berks County, is a former military surgeon who served in Iraq and who now works as a health care consultant and part-time doctor at Pottstown Memorial Medical Center. He said his medical background made him suited to deal with health care issues, including fine-tuning Obamacare and Medicare.

In the final weeks of the campaign, the national Democratic Congressional Committee reportedly opted not to pump money into the race in order to spend more on vulnerable Democrats around the country.

Trivedi had run against Gerlach in 2010 and 2012. The district leans Republican, with 202,075 registered Republicans, 182,201 registered Democrats and about 79,000 people list themselves as some other affiliation.

The district also includes parts of Berks, Chester and Montgomery counties.
