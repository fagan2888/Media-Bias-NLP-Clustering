CANNES, France (AP) — “Mad Max: Fury Road” is Tom Hardy’s second film in two years to take place almost entirely on wheels.

In 2013’s “Locke,” Hardy played a construction manager who on a speedy nighttime drive fields a series of calls to confront a painful marital indiscretion. He barely moves from his seat throughout the film.

In “Mad Max: Fury Road,” which hit theaters this weekend after a wave of critical excitement and a glitzy premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, Hardy is again on the road. This time, however, the action extravagance of director George Miller’s dystopian sequel makes for a much bumpier ride.

“It’s kind of the physicalized, athletic stunt version of ‘Locke,'” Hardy said, laughing, in a recent interview. “I did all the dialogue in ‘Locke’ and now it’s just the physical dance piece in S&M clothes.”
