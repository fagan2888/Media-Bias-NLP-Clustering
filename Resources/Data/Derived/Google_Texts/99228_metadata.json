The show usually features Seinfeld and a guest comedian driving around in a cool car. They go to a coffee shop to drink and talk.\n\nObama may not be a comedian by profession. But Seinfeld explains on the show that the president \"has gotten off just enough funny lines to qualify for getting on this show.\"\n\nThe two men meet when Seinfeld taps on the window of the Oval Office at the White House where Obama is at his desk working.\n\nSeinfeld and Obama go for a ride. Seinfeld has brought a 1963 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray. Obama calls it \"a sweet car,\" that, as a kid, he dreamed of owning someday. Seinfeld drives the president down to the gate of the White House grounds. But the Secret Service tells him, firmly, that he cannot take the president out.\n\nSo they drive back toward the house.\n\nSeinfeld asks Obama what he would like to do that he currently cannot because he is president. Obama says he would like to take a Saturday morning walk where he could run into a friend and have a chat. He says, \"Anonymity is not something you think about as being valuable.\u201d\n\nSeinfeld disagrees.\n\n\"With all due respect, I remember very well not being famous. It wasn't that great.\"\n\nSeinfeld notes the love American children have for presidents. Obama agrees, \u201cI do really well with the zero to 8 demographic. Partly \u2018cause, I think, my ears are big, and so I look a little like a cartoon character.\u201d\n\nThe two continue their talk in the White House restaurant where they make a pot of coffee. \"How many world leaders, do you think, are completely out of their mind?\" Seinfeld asks the president.\n\nObama answers, \"A pretty sizable percent. The longer they stay in office, the more likely that is to happen.\"\n\nThe show lasts about 19 minutes. Toward the end, Obama notes that he did not have the chance to discuss his health care plan, the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"Usually the only reason I do these things is because I am promoting health care,\" the president says. Seinfeld looks directly into the camera and says to viewers, \u201cIt\u2019s a great thing. Please try Obamacare today.\u201d\n\nAfter the airing of the episode, Seinfeld went on \"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert\" to talk about it. Seinfeld said, \u201cthe idea that anybody thinks they should be President. You gotta be out of your mind ... You gotta be crazy.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert, another comedian, replied, \u201cYou know what else is crazy? You have a little Internet show. And you drive around and drink coffee and crack jokes. And then you get the Commander-in-Chief to be on the show. What is up with that?\u201d\n\nI\u2019m Caty Weaver.\n\nCaty Weaver wrote this story for Learning English.
