The average age of Fox viewers is now 68, Rich notes (as opposed to 60 for MSNBC and CNN), making it more like \u201ca retirement community\u201d than a titan of the American political landscape. Rich almost had me convinced that if Fox boss Roger Ailes couldn\u2019t drink the tears of liberals, he would die of thirst, and Fox would cease to matter.\n\nWatching Fox\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly interview President Obama before the Super Bowl last night, you could find evidence for Rich\u2019s view. Obama seemed calm and sane, while O\u2019Reilly appeared unmoored from reality, like a patient who\u2019d gotten a day pass from a sanitarium where delusional convalescents babble about Benghazi and the IRS and the Obamacare website until someone comes and puts them to bed.\n\nBut I thought the sit-down mainly showed Fox\u2019s enduring hold on the political culture, which it is giving up no time soon. Consider the spectacle of a buffoon like O\u2019Reilly, who had flailed away in a marginal television career until Ailes matched his talent for bullying with the Fox audience\u2019s appetite for same, getting to grill the world\u2019s most powerful man on Super Bowl Sunday, which is for better or worse America\u2019s secular national holiday.\n\nIt\u2019s simply stunning: Longtime Republican imagemaker Ailes figured out how to make sure that our twice-elected Democratic president, backed by a coalition that represents an emerging, multiracial America, must periodically be checked and hopefully shamed by a representative of the angry right-wing white male minority that barely considers him a legitimate leader.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to laugh off the O\u2019Reilly interview. From the perspective of liberals, and we\u2019re right about this, Obama cleaned O\u2019Reilly\u2019s clock, answering his every question with clarity and the occasional appropriate edge of impatience. This Benghazi exchange was my favorite, and kind of typical of the night:\n\n\u201cYour detractors believe that you did not tell the world it was a terror attack because your campaign didn\u2019t want that out,\u201d O\u2019Reilly insisted. \u201cThat\u2019s what they believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they believe it because folks like you are telling them that,\u201d Obama shot back. He said later, \u201cThese kinds of things keep on surfacing, in part because you and your TV station will promote them.\u201d\n\nIn one exchange about a story that has already been widely debunked, O\u2019Reilly asked Obama why IRS head Doug Shulman had visited the White House 157 times, a staple of right-wing fantasizing about that IRS \u201cscandal.\u201d Supposedly Shulman was coming to the White House on the regular to plot with Obama how to take down the Tea Party. Except the Atlantic almost immediately debunked the claim last year: Yes, Shulman was \u201ccleared\u201d to visit 157 times \u2013 for meetings on a range of issues from the Affordable Care Act to financial reform \u2013 but he only actually attended meetings there 17 times, and never with Obama or anyone high in his administration. That\u2019s what O\u2019Reilly used his 10 precious minutes with the president in prime time to ask about.\n\nYou couldn\u2019t help thinking of election night, when Karl Rove wouldn\u2019t let Fox declare Obama the winner over Mitt Romney, because he had convinced himself along with the Fox audience that the incompetent and unpopular president could not possibly win. The folks inside the Fox bubble hurt themselves, because they don\u2019t see reality until it bites them in the ass. That\u2019s what gets you Bill O\u2019Reilly babbling to the president about nonexistent controversies and asking questions that were answered months ago.\n\nAnd yet I found the whole thing profoundly depressing. Maybe the worst part was when O\u2019Reilly asked a viewer\u2019s question: \u201cWhy do you feel it\u2019s necessary to fundamentally transform the nation that has afforded you so much opportunity?\u201d O\u2019Reilly presumably got lots of suggestions from viewers, and I\u2019m sure many were uglier than that. But what does it mean that that\u2019s the question he chose?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ailes and O\u2019Reilly channel the white backlash in a country trying to become a multiracial democracy.
