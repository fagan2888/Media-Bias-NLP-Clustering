Not all of those earlier readers have been kind. Although the Guardian described the publication of the long-lost manuscript 55 years after its iconic predecessor \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d as akin to unearthing \u201ca missing act from Hamlet hinting that the prince may have killed his father\u201d and praises it as a \u201cpleasure, revelation and genuine literary event,\u201d Maureen Corrigan of NPR labeled it a \u201ckind of a mess that will forever change the way we read a masterpiece.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Corrigan\u2019s horrified conclusions prove correct when the dust settles and we\u2019ve all had a chance to form our own views, one point she made is accurate: Nothing that she, or any other critic, says is going to stop any of us from buying and reading a copy of the novel for ourselves.\n\nRelated: Harper Lee and the Capote Conspiracy\n\nThe publication of \u201cGo Set a Watchman\u201d could go down in the annals of 2015 as one of the year\u2019s biggest media business sensations, as well as \u2014 or perhaps even instead of \u2014 one of its biggest literary phenomena. Even if Harper Lee\u2019s second novel doesn\u2019t bowl over readers and critics, here are five reasons why it\u2019s already a slam-dunk business triumph.\n\n1. The book is the most pre-ordered on Amazon and other websites since Harry Potter hung up his cloak of invisibility (and J. K. Rowling her Hogwart\u2019s quill.) For a while that meant the book shared space with (gasp) E.L. James\u2019s latest \u201c50 Shades\u201d tome on Amazon\u2019s lists\u2026\n\n2. Many, many fans of the original book want to own the sequel in physical form \u2014 and not the e-book version \u2014 with hardcover pre-orders outselling digital ones by two to one. Harper Collins has printed some 2 million copies, taking an outsize bet that the demand will remain robust.\n\n3. It\u2019s an indie bookstore phenomenon. This is the perfect kind of title for independent bookstores to sell to loyal customers: an intelligent, literary novel, but one that that those customers already know to ask for. Indie booksellers have been struggling for years in a rapidly changing industry, battling not only behemoth rivals but e-books as well. And if customers come in to buy one book, odds are they\u2019ll stick around and pick up more.\n\nRelated: 6 Unsung Novels You Should Read This Summer\n\n4. Big booksellers, too, are seeing a big swell of enthusiasm and sales. It\u2019s not just \u201cGo Set a Watchman\u201d; walk into any Barnes & Noble and you\u2019ll see copies of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d prominently displayed, along with tote bags and related merchandise, such as the DVD of the movie starring Gregory Peck. To celebrate the release of the new book, many Barnes & Noble outlets are planning read-a-thons of \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n5. Then there\u2019s the fact that \u201cGo Set a Watchman\u201d itself is just the tip of the iceberg. Gregory Peck may no longer be with us to play Atticus Finch, but that probably won\u2019t stop Hollywood from betting big bucks on a film version of Harper Lee\u2019s second novel, with all the spending that entails. And Lee\u2019s lawyer revealed in a Wall Street Journal op-ed that the author may have written a third novel bridging the other two.\n\nHarper Lee may continue to live a secluded existence in Monroeville, Alabama, but the publication of her second book could yet prove to be a billion-dollar windfall for all of those poised to profit from her writings.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The first reviews of Harper Lee\u2019s \u201cGo Set a Watchman\u201d began to trickle in days before", "title": "\u2018Go Set a Watchman\u2019: Why Mixed Reviews Won\u2019t Stop Harper Lee\u2019s Blockbuster", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/07/14/Go-Set-Watchman-Why-Mixed-Reviews-Won-t-Stop-Harper-Lee-s-Blockbuster", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/07142015_Mockingbird.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/07/14/Go-Set-Watchman-Why-Mixed-Reviews-Won-t-Stop-Harper-Lee-s-Blockbuster", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/07142015_Mockingbird.jpg", "creator": "@SuzMcGeeNYC", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The first reviews of Harper Lee\u2019s \u201cGo Set a Watchman\u201d began to trickle in days before", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd25a9\"", "article_summary": "The first reviews of Harper Lee\u2019s \u201cGo Set a Watchman\u201d began to trickle in days before its scheduled publication today.\nEven if Harper Lee\u2019s second novel doesn\u2019t bowl over readers and critics, here are five reasons why it\u2019s already a slam-dunk business triumph.\nGregory Peck may no longer be with us to play Atticus Finch, but that probably won\u2019t stop Hollywood from betting big bucks on a film version of Harper Lee\u2019s second novel, with all the spending that entails.\nThen there\u2019s the fact that \u201cGo Set a Watchman\u201d itself is just the tip of the iceberg.\nThis is the perfect kind of title for independent bookstores to sell to loyal customers: an intelligent, literary novel, but one that that those customers already know to ask for."}
