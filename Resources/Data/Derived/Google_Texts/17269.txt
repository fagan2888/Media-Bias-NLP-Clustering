Apollo Global Management said it has reined in $12 billion so far for its newest flagship buyout fund, which is poised to be one of the largest private equity funds raised since the economic downturn.

The firm raised about $3.3 billion during the third quarter for Apollo Investment Fund VIII LP, bringing total commitments to $10 billion as of Sept. 30. Since then, Apollo has gathered another $2 billion or so.
