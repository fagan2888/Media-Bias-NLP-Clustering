On the stage was a photo of the two men being liberated from their captors.\n\nThe Japanese government has twice apologized to U.S. POWs used as forced laborers during World War II.\n\nBut Rabbi Abraham Cooper, an associate dean at the center whose primary focus in the past has been Holocaust education, said he and the event\u2019s other organizers believe the apology is unprecedented from a major Japanese company.\n\nCooper, Murphy and others who spoke urged more Japanese companies to come forward to express their own remorse.\n\nThe ceremony was preceded by a private apology that ended with a long, deep bow from the Mitsubishi representatives. \u201cI entered the room with a heavy heart, seeking forgiveness,\u201d said Yukio Okamoto, outside board member for Mitsubishi.\n\nMurphy said that after 70 years it was \u201cthe first time we\u2019ve heard those words. They touch the heart.\u201d\n\nMurphy was gracious and beaming throughout the ceremony, expressing little bitterness or sorrow on what he called a happy day. He stressed that the apology was not half-hearted, qualified or self-aggrandizing for Mitsubishi. He said the apology \u201cadmits to wrongdoing, makes sincere statement showing deep remorse,\u201d and offers assurances that the wrongs will never be repeated.\n\n\u201cI know that we can trust those words,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nOthers, including one Mitsubishi representative, struck a sadder tone over how long the apology took. \u201cWe also have to apologize for not apologizing earlier,\u201d Okamoto said.\n\nJapan\u2019s government issued a formal apology to American POWs in 2009 and again in 2010. But the dwindling ranks of POWs used as slaves at mines and industrial plants have so far had little luck in getting apologies from the corporations who used them, sometimes under brutal conditions.\n\nAbout 12,000 American prisoners were shipped to Japan and forced to work at more than 50 sites to support imperial Japan\u2019s war effort, and about 10 percent died, said Kinue Tokudome, director of the U.S.-Japan Dialogue on POWs, who has spearheaded the lobbying effort for companies to apologize.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Saying they felt a \"deep sense of ethical responsibility for a past tragedy,\" executives from a major Japanese corporation gave an unprecedented apology Sunday to a 94-year-old U.S. prisoner of war for using American POWs for forced labor during World War II.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Saying they felt a \u201cdeep sense of ethical responsibility for a past tragedy,\u201d executives from a major Japanese corporation gave an unprecedented apology Sunday to a 94-year-old U.S. prisoner of war for using American POWs for forced labor during World War II.", "title": "Mitsubishi apologizes to U.S. POWs for forced labor during World War II", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/19/mitsubishi-apologizes-us-pows-forced-labor-during-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/19/7bba8e6634a9ae207c0f6a70670092e2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/07/19/7bba8e6634a9ae207c0f6a70670092e2.jpg", "description": "Saying they felt a \"deep sense of ethical responsibility for a past tragedy,\" executives from a major Japanese corporation gave an unprecedented apology Sunday to a 94-year-old U.S. prisoner of war fo", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Mitsubishi apologizes to U.S. POWs for forced labor during World War I"}, "Author": "Andrew Dalton", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, James Murphy, Mitsubishi Materials Corp"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd887c\"", "article_summary": "The Japanese government has twice apologized to U.S. POWs used as forced laborers during World War II.\nJapan\u2019s government issued a formal apology to American POWs in 2009 and again in 2010.\nOther POWs subjected to forced labor sat in the audience along with many members of Murphy\u2019s family.\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Saying they felt a \u201cdeep sense of ethical responsibility for a past tragedy,\u201d executives from a major Japanese corporation gave an unprecedented apology Sunday to a 94-year-old U.S. prisoner of war for using American POWs for forced labor during World War II.\nMurphy, who toiled in Mitsubishi copper mines and is one of the few left alive to accept such an apology, called it sincere, humble and revealing."}
