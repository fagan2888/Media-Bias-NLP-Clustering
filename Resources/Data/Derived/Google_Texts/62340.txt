Hillary Clinton is proudly running on her association with Obamacare and her longstanding efforts to pass healthcare reform. In two new campaign ads, Clinton promises to preserve President Obama's still-controversial healthcare overhaul.

In a new ad, "Her Fight," Clinton says, "I'm not going to let any family be deprived of healthcare. I'm not going to let the Republicans rip up Obamacare." The screen then flashes "your fights are her fights."

"Ami" highlights an American with a preexisting medical condition. Discrimination against patients with preexisting conditions was outlawed by the 2010 Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare.

"So if Republicans take away Obamacare, breast cancer survivors like me could be denied coverage," the breast cancer survivor Ami says in the ad. "If Hillary's in the White House, she's going to continue Obamacare, so I don't have to worry anymore. I trust her."

"Your fights are her fights" again flashes across the screen. Clinton's tact her is likely motivated out of a perceived weakness relative to her chief Democratic rival and looking forward to the general election. The Democratic front-runner frequently faces a deficit relative to other candidates in poll questions such as, "she shares your values," and "she understands the problems of people like you."

Further, Clinton's decision not only to fully embrace Obamacare but also her failed effort to pass healthcare reform as first lady represents a firm bet that healthcare reform is now more popular than unpopular.
