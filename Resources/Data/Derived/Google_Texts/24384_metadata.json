In his last collegiate season, the player in question threw for 3,819 yards and 36 touchdowns against just 11 interceptions. That quarterback, who would go first in the draft, was\u2014of course\u2014Peyton Manning.\n\nIf you listen to any of the pre-Super Bowl hype this week, which you will because this is America and it\u2019s impossible to avoid, it\u2019s unlikely that you will ever hear any of the talking heads discussing the athleticism of the Denver Broncos starting QB. They\u2019ll talk about his quick mind, his fast release, his arm strength, that weird red mark he gets on his forehead, but they won\u2019t talk about Peyton Manning, athlete.\n\nOn an NFL field, Manning looks slow and awkward. But that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a bad athlete. Far from it, in fact.\n\n\u201cCompared to most people in the country, he\u2019s definitely a very good athlete,\u201d says Russ Lande, a former scout for the Cleveland Browns.\n\nClint Irwin plays goalkeeper for the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer (and is a part-time Pacific Standard economics blogger). Netminders, like quarterbacks, are sometimes overlooked athletically since they play a position that traditionally relies more upon the mind than the body. Smart positioning, after all, is a goalkeeper\u2019s best friend, just like pre-snap adjustments are a QB\u2019s. I asked Irwin about the Manning conundrum.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about the best athletes in the world based on size and strength,\u201d he says. \u201cWe think that somehow because Peyton Manning doesn\u2019t look like them or doesn\u2019t move like them, we think that he\u2019s not athletic or he\u2019s just an average guy. But he\u2019s 6-foot-5, 240, and he was running a 4.9 40.\u201d\n\nA couple things: One, Peyton Manning would probably be the biggest person you know. He is an enormous dude. Smaller than the monsters who try to tackle him but a full seven inches taller and 40 pounds heavier than the average American male. Peyton Manning would kick your butt in pickup hoops. And two, he\u2019s not a plodding monstrosity. A 4.9-second 40-yard dash isn\u2019t terrible. Every November, my friends and I\u2014all of us above-average athletes\u2014try to break five seconds on a football field.
