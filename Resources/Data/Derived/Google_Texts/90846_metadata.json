They\u2019re being saddled with a six cent per fare tax that they thought was to pay for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act. But instead it\u2019s going to pay for Obamacare tutorials.\n\nWelcome to the Obamacare tax nation.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., lists some 20 new or higher taxes that will supposedly pay for the Affordable Care Act. That doesn\u2019t count the $716 billion it takes from the already under-financed Medicare program the Washington Post reported. That doesn\u2019t count the excessive premiums, co-pays and deductibles policyholders are expected to pay.\n\nNow if you\u2019re a cab driver working in New York City, you\u2019re expected to give a bit more, according to the New York Post.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s happy about it,\u201d veteran yellow-cab driver Charbel Sfeir said to the Post. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair. The money\u2019s going to go to paperwork for ObamaCare. I don\u2019t need to pay them do to paperwork.\u201d\n\nThe Post reported:\n\nThe hack tax, mandated by the city Taxi and Limousine Commission, went into effect Oct. 1 and requires that drivers pay for \u201cdisability insurance and health-care navigation services.\u201d The TLC has placed the Taxi Workers Alliance, a drivers union, in charge of administering the fund, and a final contract is being hammered out.\n\n\u201cThis is a good thing,\u201d said Bhairavi Desai, the cab union\u2019s executive director. \u201cThis is going to give services to a population that\u2019s been exploited.\u201d\n\nThe hacks Desai is supposed to represent say they\u2019re being stiffed.\n\n\u201cI thought the 6 cents would go to health care,\u201d cabby Placida Robinson said.\n\nAnd although that six cent per fare sounds minuscule, but it adds up \u2014 $10 million to $15 million per year, according to David Pollack, executive director of the Committee for Taxi Safety, who refers to the tax as a \u201cscam.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is totally out of the TLC\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not in the City Charter, and it\u2019s illegal.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, some of this new tax will go into a disability fund for the drivers, but it only amounts to about $30 per driver per year.\n\nAnd what kind of protection can one expect for $30 per year? I\u2019m guessing a first aid book and a box of Band Aids.\n\n[poll id=\u201d123\u2033]", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.3", "og": {"site_name": "BizPac Review", "description": "New York City cab drivers are hopping mad.
