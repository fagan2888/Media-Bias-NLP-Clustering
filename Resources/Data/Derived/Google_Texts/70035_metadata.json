The researchers first trained rats to fear a particular sound. A day later, the animals heard the same sound followed immediately by an electroconvulsive shock to the head. After getting shocked, the animals forgot their fear of the sound. The old memory was gone.\n\nThe study was remarkable for its focus on memory retrieval, rather than memory formation. See, research up until then had suggested that a memory is only unstable (and thus vulnerable to change) in the minutes or hours after it\u2019s first created. During this period, called \u2018consolidation\u2019, the memory moves into the brain\u2019s long-term storage and, it was thought, into a stable and fixed molecular state. \u201cFor decades people had thought that once a memory is wired in the brain it stays there forever,\u201d says Karim Nader, a neuroscientist at McGill University in Montreal. But Lewis\u2019s study showed that wasn\u2019t true: When a rat recalled a stored memory, the memory somehow became unstable again, making it vulnerable to erasure.\n\nLewis\u2019s study contained a revolutionary idea, but it didn\u2019t revolutionize the memory field. It was published in a top journal, Science, and followed up immediately by another group of researchers. But as that group reported the following year, also in Science, they couldn\u2019t replicate Lewis\u2019s findings. Over the next few decades, a couple of other studies came out suggesting that memories become unstable during recollection, but the idea never made it into the textbooks. \u201cPart of the field believed it, but the other part of the field just didn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Nader says. \u201cAnd the ones who didn\u2019t believe it were the dominant ones.\u201d\n\nNader gets credit for rekindling the idea in the late 1990s, while working as a postdoc in Joe LeDoux\u2019s lab at New York University. Nader showed that, in rats, old memories can be erased by infusing a drug into the animal\u2019s brain as it recalls the memory. Because the drug blocked protein synthesis, this experiment was evidence that memories go through a \u2018reconsolidation\u2019 process after being recalled, and that this process requires protein synthesis (just like the initial consolidation does).\n\nUnlike Lewis\u2019s study, Nader\u2019s, published in Nature in 2000, did rock the field, not least because of its clinical implications. The results opened up the possibility that the frightening memories that haunt people with post-traumatic stress disorder could be erased \u2014 even long after they are formed.\n\nA study out today in Nature Neuroscience takes this research a big step further by demonstrating not only that memory reconsolidation happens in people, but that it can be blocked with electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT.\n\nMarijn Kroes and his colleagues at Radboud University Nijmegen, in the Netherlands, tested the memories of 39 people with severe depression who were already undergoing ECT. This rare treatment has an interesting cultural history. \u201cPeople have the One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest idea of it,\u201d Kroes says, referring to the 1975 film in which Jack Nicholson\u2019s character is forced \u2014 wide awake, whimpering and writhing in pain \u2014 to undergo ECT at a mental institution. \u201cLuckily it\u2019s nothing like that.\u201d\n\nToday ECT is used as a last resort for people with severe depression who do not respond to antidepressants, psychotherapy, or other treatments. It\u2019s done in a hospital room, after the patient receives muscle relaxants and general anesthesia. A brief electric current passes through the brain, inducing a seizure. For reasons no one yet knows, it usually works: ECT had an 86 percent remission rate for people with major depression, according to one study.\n\nKroes wanted to find out whether ECT could erase memories during active recall, as it had for the rats in Lewis\u2019s experiment nearly 50 years ago.\n\nAll of the participants first saw two narrated slide shows, each describing a different traumatic story with 11 pictures. In one of them, for example, two sisters leave their house to visit their brother at a nearby bar. As they walk past an alley, one of the sisters is kidnapped by a man and held at knife point:\n\nThe other story is similar in structure, but shows a boy getting hit by a car and then in surgery having his feet reattached to his legs. In the words of the paper, these are \u201chigh-arousing stories with negative valence.\u201d I\u2019ll say.\n\nA week after the participants watched the slide shows, the researchers showed them the first slide from one of the stories as a memory trigger. A few minutes later, some participants were given ECT. After the treatment, they were given a memory test about the details of both stories.\n\nParticipants who did not undergo ECT got about half of the questions about the triggered memory correct, compared with 40 percent of questions about the other story (which they had not seen for a week).\n\nIn stark contrast, participants who received ECT seemed to have no memory of the story they had been reminded of \u2014 they scored a 25 percent on a four-answer multiple choice test, the same as guessing at random. The same participants showed significantly better recall \u2014 35 percent \u2014 of the second, non-triggered story. ECT, in other words, selectively erased the memories that were being actively recalled, just as it had for Lewis\u2019s rats.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very elegant paper, compelling data, and it\u2019s a difficult study to do,\u201d says Daniela Schiller, a neuroscientist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, who was not involved in the work. \u201cIt\u2019s very impressive they managed to do that, and that they even tried.\u201d\n\nSchiller\u2019s experiments have also bolstered the reconsolidation hypothesis. She has shown, for example, that if people recall a fearful memory and then go through \u2018extinction learning\u2019 \u2014 meaning that they\u2019re shown the fearful stimulus over and over again without any pain \u2014 they can erase the emotional sting of the memory. Other groups have shown something similar by giving people propranolol, a beta-blocker, immediately after recalling a memory.\n\nThe new study adds ECT to the list. There are still a lot of questions. For example, it\u2019s not clear how ECT is disrupting reconsolidation. Or if it\u2019s doing it at all: The effect could be partly or wholly due to anesthesia, though the researchers say this is unlikely. Most importantly, no one knows whether the procedure would work with old, real memories, as opposed to those artificially created in the lab.\n\nKroes and his colleagues are planning a clinical trial in which they will use ECT to lessen traumatic memories in people with PTSD. \u201cJust to be clear: it\u2019s a long way from being an actual clinical application,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of experimental, fundamental science is often very difficult to translate into the real world.\u201d\n\nI asked all of these scientists a question that I\u2019m sure they get every week: When are we going to be able to erase whatever memories we want, like in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind?\n\nKroes was quick to say, and rightly so, that ECT should only be used as a serious medical treatment. \u201cYou have to have some kind of disease state,\u201d he says.\n\nBut as far as the technology goes, and what it could do, everybody told me that there\u2019s no reason to think that we couldn\u2019t play out a Spotless Mind scenario in the not-too-distant future.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have said so a few years, but there\u2019s just more and more evidence, with different types of memories, different types of manipulations, and different species,\u201d Schiller says.\n\nRight or wrong, there\u2019s certainly demand for it. Nader remembers the big public response to his 2000 Nature paper. \u201cThe day after it was published, a number of women emailed Joe [LeDoux] and asked, \u2018Can you get rid of the memories of my ex-husband?'\u201d\n\nBut would he be OK with that kind of application, should the technology advance as experts expect it will? \u201cFor me,\u201d Nader says, \u201cI don\u2019t think that would be the end of the world.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"author": "Virginia Hughes", "og": {"site_name": "Phenomena", "description": "In the spring of 1968, experimental psychologist Donald Lewis\u00a0and his colleagues published a study about memory that was well before its time.
