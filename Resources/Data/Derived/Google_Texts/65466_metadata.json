Even as the unemployment rate nears pre-recession territory, wages have stubbornly stagnated. America is still waiting for a raise. Even as the unemployment rate dropped to 5.5 percent in January, wage growth was lackluster at just 0.1 percent over December. For the past 12 months, wages have risen 2 percent.\n\nWhat those numbers fail to illustrate is the magnitude of our malaise. The typical American household takes in about $52,000 before taxes. After adjusting for inflation, that\u2019s less than a similar household earned in 1989, and not appreciably more than median household income in 1973 ($49,200). In four decades, these typical families have managed a cumulative raise of just 5 percent.\n\nRelated: Americans Are About to Get a Nice Fat Pay Raise\u200b\n\nNow, imagine a world in which the labor market patterns that prevailed from World War II to the 1970s continued right up until the present day. How much more would the typical American household be earning per year?\n\n$51,000.\n\nThat\u2019s right. If post-World War II trends in productivity growth, labor force participation, and income equality had persisted, middle-class Americans would be earning double what they actually do today. Six-figure incomes would be the norm. Instead, we\u2019ve seen productivity languish, participation plummet, and inequality soar\u2014 and raises vanish.\n\nThese figures come from the 2015 Economic Report of the President (ERP), the most important economic policy document the White House produces each year besides its budget proposal.\n\nWhile the troubling trends the report identifies are long-lived, they hold special relevance for the painful paradox we\u2019ve experienced in recent years: Unemployment is falling, but earnings aren\u2019t rising. In theory, this makes no sense. When the supply of workers shrinks relative to the demand for them, wages should increase. It\u2019s Econ 101. So what gives?\n\nRelated: 5 Million Job Openings, So Why Can\u2019t You Get Hired?\n\n\n\nThe answer goes right back to three trends covered by the White House report: participation, productivity and inequality.\n\nHalf the Battle Is Showing Up\n\nFirst, participation. As it turns out, the labor market isn\u2019t as tight as the unemployment rate indicates. Since 2007, labor force participation has fallen 3.1 percentage points, from 66.0 percent to 62.8 percent. Some decline was expected due to the aging of the population, but demographics explain about only half the drop; moreover, among prime-aged workers 25-54 years, participation has decreased by 2.0 percentage points.\n\nWhat does this have to do with your paycheck?\n\nYou might think that fewer active job seekers \u2014 those officially labeled as \u201cunemployed\u201d \u2014 would necessarily imply tighter labor markets and higher wages. But exactly the opposite can be true. As it turns out, about half the workers who gain employment in a given month were formerly not active in the job market, which means that many people who say they aren\u2019t interested in jobs actually are, competing with the officially unemployed to find work.\n\nRelated: The Real Reason Walmart Is Raising Worker Pay\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nWhen participation is falling, as it is now, a decline in the unemployment rate doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a one-for-one decline in the number of job seekers, but rather that the composition of the applicant pool is changing \u2014 with those who are less connected to the working world moving back toward it.\n\nThis compositional shift is also evident among the officially unemployed themselves. One of the sorry legacies of the Great Recession has been an unprecedented uptick in long-term unemployment (episodes lasting six months or more), which, as a share of overall unemployment, rose to 45.8 percent in 2011 from its average of 16.6 percent in the decade preceding the financial crisis. Though it has retreated recently, the long-term unemployment share is still 31.1 percent \u2014 far above the historical norm.\n\nWhen disconnected job seekers comprise a larger and larger portion of the labor pool that is bad news for wages. It\u2019s well documented that the longer you\u2019re out of work, the more difficult it is to find a job. Not only do skills atrophy and networks evaporate, but employers are hesitant to hire those blemished with long layoffs. According to the White House report, a third of those unemployed less than a month find work in the next month; for those unemployed more than a year, the number drops to 8 percent. People not actively participating in the labor market are in a similar spot. And thus, unemployment feeds on itself.\n\nRelated: Why Federal Workers Are Better Off Than the Rest of Us \u200b\n\n\n\nAs you might imagine, this doesn\u2019t put either group in a particularly strong place when it comes to wage negotiations\u2014so the larger the share of disconnected workers in the applicant pool, weaker will be pressure on wages.\n\nYou Earn What You Make...\n\nTo make matters worse, labor productivity has been weak. Since 2011, it\u2019s grown just 0.7 percent annually \u2014 a far cry from the 2.1 percent annual growth it averaged during the previous 30 years, and the 2.4 percent it averaged in the three decades before that. Because workers are paid (roughly) in proportion to what they produce, slow productivity growth means slow wage growth.\n\nWhile labor productivity depends on numerous factors, the primary explanations for the slowdown are weaker growth in business investment, employee educational attainment and technological innovation.\n\n...Except There\u2019s More to the Story\n\nAs disappointing as recent productivity growth has been, earnings growth has been even slower. Since 2007, labor productivity is up 10 percent, while average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees (a good proxy for a typical worker\u2019s earnings) is up just 4 percent. Going back even further, productivity has grown 108 percent since 1973, while inflation-adjusted earnings are actually down 7 percent.\n\nThis remarkable divergence between what workers make and what they earn has a societal consequence: inequality. And that\u2019s the third point of the White House report. To the extent we\u2019ve seen incomes rise during the past several decades, most of the gains have gone to fortunate few \u2014 the very top earners.\n\nRelated: The Incessant Myth of the Growing Wealth Gap\u200b\u200b\n\nConsider this startling fact: If the income distribution today were the same as it was in 1966, the bottom 90 percent of earners would have about $1.9 trillion more income. That\u2019s about $6,700 per person, or $27,000 for a family of four. Instead, during the past five decades, we\u2019ve seen the average income of those in the top 10 percent increase by 89 percent, while income growth of the bottom 90 percent has been\u2026 0.1 percent\u2014in other words, nothing. And it\u2019s even more skewed at the very top, with the top 0.1 percent of Americans enjoying a 340 percent raise.\n\nIt\u2019s Time To Make Your Case\n\nSo, if you\u2019re upset about not getting that raise, take solace in the fact that (a) you\u2019re not alone, and (b) it\u2019s probably not your fault. Instead, a slack labor market, a secular downturn in productivity and a vastly unequal playing field are to blame.\n\nIn America, we tend to accept market outcomes as inevitable and infallible \u2014 but we shouldn\u2019t.\n\nRelated: Why Middle Class Tax Relief Is Taking Center Stage\u200b\u200b\n\nAs the White House economic report explains, policy choices make a difference. Business tax reform, increased public spending on infrastructure and expanded access to college can jump-start productivity. Addressing discrimination in hiring and providing work supports such as paid family leave and child care can enable more Americans to participate in the workforce. And limiting the worst excesses of the executive suite while pursuing a smarter, more stimulative fiscal agenda can help remediate some of the avoidable inequalities that divide us.\n\nIn short, you won\u2019t be $51,000 richer unless Americans support the kinds of policies that help the average worker. It won\u2019t be easy. But, as with getting a raise, change often only comes when we have the courage to demand it.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "If you\u2019re anything like most Americans, you\u2019ve probably noticed someth", "title": "You Could Be $51,000 Richer", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/03/06/You-Could-Be-51000-Richer", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04172013_money_balloon_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/03/06/You-Could-Be-51000-Richer", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04172013_money_balloon_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "If you\u2019re anything like most Americans, you\u2019ve probably noticed someth", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In short, you won\u2019t be $51,000 richer unless Americans support the kinds of policies that help the average worker.\nThe answer goes right back to three trends covered by the White House report: participation, productivity and inequality.\n...Except There\u2019s More to the StoryAs disappointing as recent productivity growth has been, earnings growth has been even slower.\nIf you\u2019re anything like most Americans, you\u2019ve probably noticed something has been missing from the labor market recovery of the past few years: rising incomes.\nBecause workers are paid (roughly) in proportion to what they produce, slow productivity growth means slow wage growth."}
