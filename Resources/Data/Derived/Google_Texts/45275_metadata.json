Chellie Pingree.\n\nAdditional Images Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree is seeking her fourth term.

And while Pingree\u2019s two opponents are busy courting voters as Election Day approaches, their campaigns have struggled to build the name recognition and support from outside groups needed to challenge a well-known and better-financed incumbent.\n\nSeveral independent public opinion polls give the three-term incumbent a commanding lead.\n\nFirst elected to Congress in 2008, Pingree, of North Haven, won her two subsequent campaigns by comfortable margins. Pingree, 59, also served eight years in the Maine Senate, including as Senate majority leader. The co-owner of North Haven\u2019s Nebo Lodge bed and breakfast who also ran an organic farm, Pingree has been most active in Congress on agricultural issues affecting small farmers.\n\nPingree is married to S. Donald Sussman, majority owner of MaineToday Media, which publishes the Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram, the Kennebec Journal in Augusta and the Morning Sentinel in Waterville.\n\nA progressive who is considered the Maine delegation\u2019s most liberal member, Pingree was appointed by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi in 2012 to a prized seat on the House Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for divvying up the federal budget alongside its Senate counterpart.\n\nEarlier this year, Fortune magazine named Pingree No. 2 on its list of the \u201cMost Innovative Women in Food and Drink\u201d because of her focus on sustainable agriculture and the concerns of small farmers. She has successfully sponsored measures to support farm-to-table and farm-to-school lunch table programs and to allow food stamp recipients to use their electronic swipe cards at farmers markets. Pingree has also sought to ease the regulatory burden on small farms and organic operations.\n\nBut with conservative Republicans in control of the House, Pingree and other Democrats have been largely unable to pursue their own policy objectives. She has also criticized Republican efforts to cut funding for food stamps and other social programs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a frustrating time to be a member of Congress,\u201d Pingree said during a recent WGME-13 debate. \u201cWe have enormously challenging issues before us \u2026 and I understand people\u2019s sense of frustration. And all that I can promise the voters is that I do my very best to represent the people of Maine. I do my very best to try to work across the aisle with Republicans and Democrats.\u201d\n\nPingree is pro-abortion rights, is strongly critical of U.S. spending overseas on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, opposes the construction of the Keystone XL crude oil pipeline, and has advocated for more investment in renewable energy. She voted for the Affordable Care Act but prefers a single-payer health care system.\n\nShe faces a young Republican, Misiuk, who has the verbal backing of the state party but has received little financial support, and an independent, Murphy, who is running on an anti-Washington platform while pledging to defend the U.S. Constitution.\n\nMisiuk, a self-described conservative who put his studies at the University of Southern Maine on hold to campaign, said he joined the race for the 1st District in order to end what he describes as \u201ctaxation without representation\u201d for younger generations. The Gorham resident said he will represent Maine voters of all ages if elected, and he frequently talks about the need to protect Social Security, fulfill promises to veterans and trim government spending.\n\nBut Misiuk said he is frequently left with one question when reviewing congressional attempts to solve pressing problems.\n\n\u201cWho is going to pay for it?\u201d Misiuk said in June during an event re-launching his campaign after the primary. \u201cAnd the answer is always the same: the youth. If Congress is going to stick us with the bill, we at least deserve a seat at the table.\u201d\n\nAt joint events with the three contenders, Misiuk, 25, was the only candidate to say he believes the U.S. may need to commit ground combat forces with partner nations to defeat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. On the issue of the Affordable Care Act, Misiuk criticized the law but said the window for repeal has closed and that efforts need to focus on improving the law.\n\nHe serves as co-chairman of the Cumberland County Young Republicans but has not held political office before.\n\nMurphy, an independent whose conservative values mirror many of those in the tea party movement, has sought to set himself apart as the outsider who will not be beholden to anyone but Maine voters \u2013 and even drew up a \u201cguaranty agreement\u201d pledging to resign if voters believe he has broken his oath.\n\nA former Republican, Murphy said he switched to unenrolled or independent after growing weary of what he sees as the politics of self-interest in Washington.\n\n\u201cI was frustrated with the way both of the parties didn\u2019t seem to be doing much for the people they were supposed to be serving,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThey bicker, they go back and forth over issues and waste time. They don\u2019t legislate.\u201d\n\nMurphy, 36, of Springvale, is a twice-deployed active member of the Massachusetts Army National Guard who argues that the U.S. needs to stop sending troops and money overseas to try to solve historic problems in regions such as the Middle East.\n\nHe has worked in civil engineering, contracting and real estate but said he was forced to take jobs overseas \u2013 in South Korea, Indonesia and Malaysia \u2013 to support his family back in Maine. During a recent forum for the homeless at Portland\u2019s Preble Street Resource Center, he told one upset woman, \u201cI am so close to where you are coming from.\u201d\n\nThe independent said the experiences opened his eyes to how things are done elsewhere but also to what he believes is an erosion of freedoms in the U.S. His 14-point \u201coath to voters\u201d includes pledges to support the U.S. Constitution, defend state sovereignty, push for minimal government involvement, and support a flat-tax code.\n\nThe 2014 race for the 1st Congressional District began early, with both Misiuk and Murphy announcing their candidacies over a year ago. But with Election Day roughly two weeks away, the already low-key race is being further overshadowed by the intense, big-money competitions for governor and the larger, less politically predictable 2nd District.\n\nPingree held a large lead over Misiuk, 66 percent to 13 percent, in a mid-September poll conducted for the Press Herald by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, with 17 percent undecided. While Murphy did not receive any support in that poll, two October surveys taken after the first televised debate showed him receiving roughly 10 percent of the vote in each poll while Misiuk received 8.7 percent and 19 percent. Pingree still polled at more than 50 percent in those polls, conducted by Pan Atlantic SMS Group and Critical Insights.\n\n\u201cThere is no surprise here,\u201d said Brian Duff, a University of New England political scientist who noted that Pingree benefits from the fact that congressional incumbents are hard to unseat. \u201cYou have a liberal Democrat in a pretty liberal district and not a lot of extra money is getting pumped in.\u201d\n\nThree leading political organizations that closely track congressional races nationwide \u2013 Larry Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia, the Cook Political Report and the Rothenberg Political Report \u2013 all rate the race as a \u201csafe\u201d seat for Pingree.\n\nThe three candidates have appeared together three times: at two televised debates and at a forum for Portland\u2019s homeless population.\n\nPingree has done some \u201cretail politics,\u201d such as walking streets and shaking hands, but has not held major campaign events or fundraisers. Although Misiuk staged a two-day bus tour of the district this past weekend, both he and Murphy have focused on attending events, knocking on doors and placing a limited number of signs around the district.\n\nMisiuk reported raising just over $20,000 for his campaign through Sept. 30 \u2013 roughly 5 percent of the $382,800 raised by Pingree during the election cycle despite the fact that the Democrat has not been aggressively seeking donations or campaigning. Murphy raised $8,370 through the end of September, according to reports on file with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nDuring the 2012 election, the 22 challengers who defeated an incumbent House member spent, on average, more than $2 million on their campaigns, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. The odds of defeating an incumbent while spending less than $1 million that year were 293-to-2.\n\nAsked about fundraising, Murphy said he was warned not to run unless he could raise $500,000. He said the warning didn\u2019t discourage him \u201cand I\u2019m getting my name out there.\u201d\n\nMisiuk said he has seen the polls but remains optimistic, adding that \u201cthe only poll that counts is Nov. 4th.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Several polls indicate popular incumbent Chellie Pingree has a commanding lead over a pair of newcomers for the House seat.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "Several polls indicate popular incumbent Chellie Pingree has a commanding lead over a pair of newcomers for the House seat.", "title": "Low-key campaigns mark race in 1st District - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/522104_858050-20141010_Candidate2.jpg", "height": 933}, "updated_time": "2014-10-31T11:22:51-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/10/20/low-key-campaigns-mark-race-in-1st-district/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Several polls indicate popular incumbent Chellie Pingree has a commanding lead over a pair of newcomers for the House seat.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/522104_858050-20141010_Candidate2.jpg", "title": "Low-key campaigns mark race in 1st District - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2014-10-20T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-31T11:22:51-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcce8f\"", "article_summary": "Pingree is married to S.
