Sounds like a pretty good deal\n\nMost likely you won't have noticed as your smartphones and computers should have automatically ticked over already for Daylight Saving - which will last until Sunday the 5th of April next year.\n\nBut the good news is, besides getting that lost hour back in a few months' time, that you'll get an extra hour of sunshine at the end of each day over summer.\n\nDaylight Saving in Australia has come into effect if you live in New South Wales, Victoria, ACT, Tasmania and South Australia.\n\nQueensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia do NOT follow Daylight Saving, meaning residents of those areas will keep their regular time zones.\n\nThe following time zones are now in effect, per the Australian Government website.\n\nDAYLIGHT SAVING AND TIME ZONES AEST: Queensland AEDT: NSW (except Broken Hill), Victoria, Tamania, ACT ACDT: South Australia and Broken Hill, NSW ACST: NT AWST: Western Australia", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Feeling,little,sleepy,today,Daylight,Saving,means,clocks,jumped,forward,HOUR,don,t,worry,ll,end,summer", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2780671/Feeling-little-sleepy-today-Daylight-Saving-means-clocks-jumped-forward-HOUR-don-t-worry-ll-end-summer.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Today is the start of Daylight Saving for most Australian states and territories - except for Queensland, WA and the Northern Territory.", "title": "Daylight Saving means your clocks have jumped forward an HOUR", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2780671/Feeling-little-sleepy-today-Daylight-Saving-means-clocks-jumped-forward-HOUR-don-t-worry-ll-end-summer.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/04/1412443411146_wps_8_B3GFK9_A_young_woman_teen.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2780671/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2780671/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2780671, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Feeling,little,sleepy,today,Daylight,Saving,means,clocks,jumped,forward,HOUR,don,t,worry,ll,end,summer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-10-04T17:23:56.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Chris+Paine+for+Daily+Mail+Australia", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-10-05T15:50:22.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Feeling little sleepy today Daylight Saving means clocks jumped forward HOUR don t worry ll end summer"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Today is the start of Daylight Saving for most Australian states and territories - except for Queensland, WA and the Northern Territory.", "title": "Daylight Saving means your clocks have jumped forward an HOUR", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2780671/Feeling-little-sleepy-today-Daylight-Saving-means-clocks-jumped-forward-HOUR-don-t-worry-ll-end-summer.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/04/1412443411146_wps_8_B3GFK9_A_young_woman_teen.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Today is the start of Daylight Saving for most Australian states and territories - except for Queensland, WA and the Northern Territory."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2d28\"", "article_summary": "Well, technically, you did, because today is the start of Daylight Saving for most Australian states and territories.\nDaylight Saving in Australia has come into effect if you live in New South Wales, Victoria, ACT, Tasmania and South Australia.\nQueensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia do NOT follow Daylight Saving, meaning residents of those areas will keep their regular time zones.\nDAYLIGHT SAVING AND TIME ZONES AEST: Queensland AEDT: NSW (except Broken Hill), Victoria, Tamania, ACT ACDT: South Australia and Broken Hill, NSW ACST: NT AWST: Western Australia\nMake sure your clocks are set an hour forward (if they haven't switched over automatically already)An extra hour to spend at the beach?"}
