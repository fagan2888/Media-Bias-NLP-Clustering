Ron Kind's College Affordability Action Plan will help college students like me.\n\nGraduation selfie (Photo: Nate Beeler/Syndicated by Cagle Cartoons)\n\nEDITOR: As a student at University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point, I am so glad that U.S. Rep. Ron Kind has noticed the burden college students face, and is ready to do something to help us. In his College Affordability Action Plan, Kind is addressing the mounting debt from school loans students face and his solutions are compelling. Through his plan the federal government would no longer benefit from my debt. The money received from the federal government from student loans would be moved into federal grants to help students like me to finish my education.\n\nNot only is Kind proposing to eliminate the federal government from profiting from student loans, but also he is proposing the opportunity for students like me to refinance loans if interest rates drop. This is a great opportunity because it would save me money on interest payments every single month. This is similar to refinancing with mortgages, and it just doesn't make sense that people can refinance a mortgage loan but not a student loan. Kind's proposal is just common sense.\n\nAs I get closer to entering the workforce and making a name for myself I really hope more people jump on board with this action plan from Ron Kind. He is showing that college students pursuing a career shouldn't have to pay so much in loans to receive a higher education and I would like to see Congress put aside their differences to invest in our future.\n\nTyler Smith,\n\nStevens Point\n\nRead or Share this story: http://spjour.nl/1EpSTn7", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Rep.
