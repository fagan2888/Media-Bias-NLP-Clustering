He just didn't swing at all.\n\nIt seems odd to recall now, but former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty was fairly well-positioned to win the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. He had been on the short list to be the party's vice presidential nominee in 2008. He was a Republican governor of a Democratic-leaning state. He had crafted an image as a blue-collar conservative. And he had hired the most sought-after campaign manager in the business. But Pawlenty\u2019s campaign never really took off and ended soon after it began. In the latest episode of \"Candidate Confessional,\" Pawlenty said he flamed out quickly because he didn\u2019t have enough money and couldn\u2019t settle on a sharp message that resonated with the public. The other issue was that Pawlenty, to borrow a hackneyed term, was too Minnesota Nice. Nothing better exemplifies this than the moment that has come to define his candidacy: his inability to directly attack GOP front-runner Mitt Romney during a debate. While the moment itself has taken its place in the annals of campaign flubs -- \"I just botched the answer,\" Pawlenty said -- the behind-the-scenes story is less known.\n\nPawlenty told \"Candidate Confessional\" that he came up with the idea of using the term \u201cObamneycare\u201d as a way of pointing out that Romney\u2019s health care plan in Massachusetts had been the model for President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act -- which, of course, conservatives have attempted to repeal countless times. His staff liked the awkward term. He had tried it out in a couple of speeches and a Sunday morning interview. Pawlenty planned to use it again during the debate. But the question ended up coming from a member of the audience -- not the moderator -- which complicated those plans. In debate prep, political consultants had instructed the governor that he had to do three things with each answer: 1) tailor his response to the person asking the question; 2) attack Obama; and 3) get around to answering the question, presumably by attacking Romney. He had to do all three things within the given time limits and look natural doing it. As Pawlenty worked his way through the three steps, the moderator, CNN's John King, started to grow audibly impatient. \u201cI wasn\u2019t through my three-point checklist yet,\" Pawlenty recalled. \u201c[King] and I get in this back and forth. I\u2019m off my three-point, you know, checklist and I should have just blurted out -- you know, yelled in the microphone -- yes, damnit, Obamneycare!\" Instead, Pawlenty blinked. A lot. He repeated his criticisms of Obama, but he never did bellow the phrase. He came across looking, well, too Minnesota Nice.\n\nIn the moment, Pawlenty didn\u2019t fully appreciate how badly his flub stood out. \u201cI thought the answer wasn\u2019t great but I didn\u2019t think it was awful,\" he said. \"But I remember during a break I was going to the bathroom or back to the dressing room for something ... I remember Nick [Ayers], my campaign manager, who I like a lot, was ashen standing back by one of the doors.\" \"And he\u2019s like, 'You know you gotta fix this,'\" Pawlenty said. \"I\u2019m like, \u2018Fix what?\u2019 He\u2019s like, 'You know, the Obamneycare answer.'\" But the topic didn't come up again. Instead, pundits and viewers were left with the image of Pawlenty hesitating to attack the man who would become the GOP nominee. Listen to the podcast above, or download it on iTunes.
