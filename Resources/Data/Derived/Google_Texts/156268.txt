ISIS posts a new video showing hostage John Cantlie

The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria released a new propaganda video on Monday in which a British hostage, photojournalist John Cantlie, gives a tour of the besieged Syrian town of Kobani on the Turkish border. In the clip, Cantlie criticizes the Western media's reporting on ISIS' battle for the mostly Kurdish city, saying that areas reported to be under Kurdish control were really in the hands of ISIS. Cantlie said foreign journalists were getting the story wrong because they were getting their news from "Kurdish commanders and White House press secretaries."
