LIVINGSTON â€” Fire ripped through Livingston's historic Blue Store Restaurant overnight as about 14 fire departments from as far as Leeds in Greene County battled the blaze.

The Columbia County Cause and Origin team are on the scene trying to determine what caused the inferno that began at about 1:50 a.m. Saturday as firefighters continued working to extinguish the fire at 8 a.m. Saturday, said Tara Buffa, whose husband, Darrin, has co-owned the restaurant for the past three-and-a-half years.

Firefighters trucked water in from a pond to fight the fire because there are no fire hydrants in the remote location at Routes 9 and 31.

"We're not really sure what started it," said Buffa, who is a sales representative for Columbia-Greene Media. "My husband just left the restaurant and I got a call from a friend that the building was burning."

The building, built in 1804, is a landmark and the only thing remaining Saturday morning was the front corner of the structure.

"This is a little surreal," Buffa said from the scene. "I've just never seen, in one spot, so many firefighters."
