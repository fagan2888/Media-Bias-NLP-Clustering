He offered an illustration:\n\n\u201cOne of these people comes up to my door and knocks and we open the door, and they say, \u2018We\u2019re here representing a federal program and we\u2019d like to talk with you,\u2019\u201d Brown said. \u201cNow, most people, seeing this, would be scared. Many of them would be intimidated, and the first impulse is to let them in the door. Now, is that voluntary?\u201d\n\nIncentive to Grow\n\nThe law pushes states to increase home visits, which could further pressure parents, Brown said.\n\n\u201c[States] have to show that they\u2019ve made successful interventions, or if they have not, to report that. If the [Health and Human Services] secretary finds that they have not, they\u2019re going to have to implement a corrective plan or lose the contract,\u201d he said.\n\nIncreased participation bumps up statistics.\n\n\u201cSocial service programs love to take parents and turn them into clients,\u201d Woodruff said. \u201cThat makes the social workers\u2019 statistics look really good. \u2018Gee, I helped 100 people.\u2019 If someone says, \u2018No, thank you, go away,\u2019 they can\u2019t put that person in that category of people they helped.\u201d\n\nUsing Vulnerable Moments\n\nThe program will likely be pushed on families in vulnerable moments\u2014at the hospital when babies are born, at doctors\u2019 offices, and at school, said Will Estrada, HSLDA\u2019s director of federal relations.\n\n\u201cHSLDA isn\u2019t saying there shouldn\u2019t be home visitation programs if a family decides they want it, but \u2026 parents, not government bureaucrats, should be making the decision whether they need these services,\u201d he said.\n\nSome welfare programs require recipients to let social workers check in and make sure taxpayer money is being used properly.\n\n\u201cBe very careful about accepting government handouts,\u201d Estrada said. \u201cWe don\u2019t tell you not to accept it, but nothing comes free, so really look at the fine print. \u2026 Look at what you\u2019re promising to do or agreeing to do in exchange.\u201d\n\nFamily Security and the Fourth Amendment\n\nThe Fourth Amendment protects citizens from \u201cunreasonable search and seizure,\u201d and it\u2019s important for families to know their rights, Woodruff said. If officials do not have a warrant and there is no obvious life-threatening emergency, it\u2019s generally best to send them away.\n\nSocial workers sometimes threaten parents with \u201cwe\u2019ll take your kids,\u201d Estrada said \u2013 a terrifying threat that\u2019s typically empty.\n\n\u201cWhere you\u2019ve got these teams of people going out to people\u2019s houses unannounced, how many of them are going to say, \u201cListen, I want a lawyer,\u2019 or, \u2018The Fourth Amendment protects my house, so stay away\u2019?\u201d Brown asked.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Human Events", "description": "\"It's the government wanting to step in and tell you how to raise your kids.\"", "title": "Government home visits to increase under Obamacare", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/da_410_reservert_det_viktige_-_caleb_cassler-sxc-480x360.jpg", "url": "http://humanevents.com/2013/09/11/government-home-visits-to-increase-under-obamacare/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"pages": 212436860202}, "description": "\"It's the government wanting to step in and tell you how to raise your kids.\"", "twitter": {"image": "http://humanevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/da_410_reservert_det_viktige_-_caleb_cassler-sxc-480x360.jpg", "site": "@humanevents", "card": "summary", "description": "\"It's the government wanting to step in and tell you how to raise your kids.\""}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b06\"", "article_summary": "Thanks to ObamaCare, states can receive federal grants to increase home visits, a move that raises concerns about government intrusion into family life.\nIn existing home visit programs, social workers visit the homes of certain \u201cat-risk\u201d groups, aiming to improve family health and school readiness and decrease domestic violence.\nNow, is that voluntary?\u201dIncentive to GrowThe law pushes states to increase home visits, which could further pressure parents, Brown said.\nBut there\u2019s no guarantee state officials and social workers won\u2019t pressure or intimidate parents into permitting home visits, said attorney Kent Brown.\nSocial workers sometimes threaten parents with \u201cwe\u2019ll take your kids,\u201d Estrada said \u2013 a terrifying threat that\u2019s typically empty."}
