No team makes it to the postseason without eye-opening players. But surviving the NFL schedule requires sudden, if not desperate, bursts of improvisation.\n\nAll because of injuries.\n\nThe previous Sunday night, the New England Patriots walked onto snow-covered Sports Authority Field at Mile High boasting an undefeated record. They woke up Monday as the AFC\u2019s third seed, reeling from the absence of tight end Rob Gronkow ski, losers of two straight games.\n\nPHOTOS: Pictures from the Broncos-Chargers game\n\nThe Broncos moved into position to secure the AFC\u2019s top seed, held by the Cincinnati Bengals in a three-way tie because of their conference record. Denver sits at 10-2, but vulnerability exists.\n\nAlready without strong safety T.J. Ward, nose tackle Sylvester Williams and edge rusher DeMarcus Ware, the Broncos lost linebacker Danny Trevathan (concussion) and defensive backs David Bruton (knee) and Omar Bolden (hamstring) during Sunday\u2019s 17-3 victory over the San Diego Chargers. Offensively, running back C.J. Anderson (ankle) and Vernon Davis (concussion) exited over the final three plays of the first half.\n\nBESTS/WORSTS: Broncos\u2019 Von Miller and Demaryius Thomas\n\nNone was considered serious. But optimism can\u2019t replace tests. The players must heal, show they can practice.\n\nWhat December football shows is how much August matters. Coach Gary Kubiak made a point to integrate young players during training camp. He provides backups a share of first-team reps. He lets them get meaningful, though brief, looks during the week in the regular season. It has paid dividends.\n\nSunday, young linebackers Todd Davis and Corey Nelson filled in for Trevathan \u2014 who scored on a 25-yard first-quarter interception return \u2014 in the second half. Davis excelled in coverage. Nelson collected two tackles. Safety Josh Bush, signed as a free agent last week with Ward out, forced a fumble.\n\n\u201cWe are beat up. I am sure everybody in the league is,\u201d Kubiak said after the Broncos extended their NFL record divisional road winning streak to 15 games. \u201cWe are going to have to call on people down the stretch. The good news is that they are getting to play.\u201d\n\nAnderson injured his ankle on a 12-yard pass reception. He showed a slight limp as he jogged it off on the sideline. With a 14-point lead, the Broncos took a cautious approach, ruling him out.\n\n\u201cIf I would have cut back, I probably would have had none of that. That\u2019s all right I deserve it. They were being smart. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything big,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI am not worried at all.\u201d\n\nTroy E.
