Even a low-dose of daily aspirin can lead to internal bleeding and other health complications.\n\nIn 2014 the FDA published a report saying it's not a good idea to use aspirin as the primary tool to prevent a heart attack or stroke. Studies show there's an increased risk of bleeding for long-term aspirin users. (Video via 5News)\n\n\"This issue here is why, why? It's a baby aspirin. What's the big deal? It's 81 miligrams a day. Well, it's not necessarily a benign intervention. People can have GI bleeds or an ulcer that bleeds,\" Dr. Natalie Azar said on \"Today.\"\n\nUsing aspirin to prevent colorectal cancer and heart disease definitely isn't for everyone. The task force says for the best results, you need to have not had a heart attack before, not have a risk for increased bleeding and be able to take the daily dose for at least 10 years.\n\nOh, and you need to be between the ages of 50 and 69.\n\nThe task force has made controversial recommendations before. In 2009, the task force suggested women should wait until age 50 to start getting regular mammograms.
