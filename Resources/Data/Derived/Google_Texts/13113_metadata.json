I\u2019m getting everything I can get done in that 13 months.\u201d\n\nThe stakes couldn\u2019t be higher for Obama and for Burwell, who will be 51 when the Obama administration comes to an end. Former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, for whom she was chief of staff between 1995 and 1997, said Burwell would be on his short list to lead Treasury in another Democratic administration, saying she has a \u201cterrific political sense.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile there\u2019s the presidential election looming, with Republican candidates who want to repeal the 2010 law ready to spotlight any stumble. On Thursday, the Republican-led Senate voted to repeal key parts of the law, underscoring the ongoing opposition. How Obamacare performs in the next 12 months could determine its fortunes.\n\nPolitical Football\n\n\u201cThe ACA, even though it\u2019s helping a bunch of people, isn\u2019t untouchable in the political process,\u201d said Dylan Roby, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health. Burwell and her team \u201cwill need to make sure the website works fairly flawlessly, they need to make sure they see increases in enrollment.\u201d\n\nIndividuals are now signing up for health insurance for the third time in the new markets created by the law. And while the main insurance shopping website has overcome the glitches that plagued its rollout, it\u2019s still not smooth sailing for the ACA. Premiums are going up 10 percent or more in many markets, though about 84 percent of customers get subsidies to help them afford coverage. Burwell herself has said enrollment may not increase as much as some had expected.\n\nBurwell acknowledged that people have had some trouble picking the right policies, with some deciding based mainly on how expensive policies were, rather than on what\u2019s covered. To help, the government is now adding to its shopping website estimates of how much an individual should expect to spend in total under different plans, giving a better idea of what out-of-pocket costs will be.\n\nStruggling Insurers\n\nMeanwhile, some insurers have struggled to make a go of it financially. Twelve of the 23 nonprofits set up by the law are failing. UnitedHealth Group Inc., the largest U.S. health insurer, has warned it may withdraw from ACA marketplaces because it can\u2019t make money.\n\nHealth-care stocks have more than doubled since Obama signed the act, buoyed by millions of new customers with health policies bought with ACA subsidies, and shares of insurers like UnitedHealth have tripled. Yet investors have become more jittery recently, amid signs the health law\u2019s gains are slowing, or even reversing. Hospital-stock volatility is the highest it\u2019s been since late 2011, and managed-care-stock volatility has shot up as well.\n\nBurwell said she\u2019s focused on the bigger picture. \u201cWe need to continue to move on the path of transformation,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act, while we all focus on it very much in terms of access, was about affordability and quality and transforming the fundamentals of the system as a whole.\u201d\n\nShe pointed out that about 17.6 million people gained coverage under the law who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have it. That includes the expansion of Medicaid coverage to more low-income people, and children who are allowed to stay on their parents\u2019 policies longer than before the ACA. For adults, the uninsured rate has fallen to about 11.6 percent, from 17.1 percent just before the law went into effect.\n\nEmployer Burden\n\nA provision of the law that requires companies to give workers health insurance had been derided as a job killer. A Bloomberg review of company conference-call transcripts and interviews with major U.S. employers found that, instead, it\u2019s turned out to be not much of a burden at all.\n\nBeyond the coverage expansion, the law is changing how care is paid for and delivered in the U.S., Burwell said. It\u2019s pushing doctors and hospitals to collaborate more closely and to improve the quality of the care they deliver. Government actuaries estimate that health-care spending in the U.S. will rise by about 5.8 percent annually through 2024. It increased an average of 6.9 percent a year in the decade before the law was passed.\n\nScarce Time\n\nThe secretary isn\u2019t the only one watching the clock. \u201cTime is our scarcest commodity. We\u2019re all very aware of it now as we approach the last year,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, who was Burwell\u2019s boss in the Clinton administration. \u201cShe\u2019s always about her list, and about using her time to take care of the things that are most important.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether she might be the first female Treasury secretary, the woman who gets to sign the $10 bill that will feature a woman, Burwell laughed for a moment before answering.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply focused on what I\u2019m working on now, and enjoying it, and it\u2019s challenging every day,\u201d she said. \u201cI think we will see what happens in terms of all of those issues, and I look forward\u201d after the Obama administration ends, \u201cto observing and watching.\u201d\n\nVaried Resume\n\nBurwell replaced Kathleen Sebelius, the former Kansas governor who oversaw the troubled early days of the health law. For just more than a year before that, she led the OMB. Those were her first Washington posts since she served all eight years in Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, starting at the National Economic Council, before becoming Rubin\u2019s chief of staff at Treasury and then deputy director of OMB under Lew.\n\nIn between the Clinton and Obama administrations, she ran the global development program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and was president of the Walmart Foundation. She graduated from Harvard University with a degree in government and studied philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar.\n\nIn an on-stage interview with Carlyle Group founder David Rubenstein at the Economic Club of Washington, Burwell said she\u2019d learned a few lessons from her foundation work. One, she said, was to define, at the start, the goal of a project.\n\nThe other, she said, is her approach to problem solving. \u201cWhich is, what\u2019s the problem you\u2019re trying to solve, that circle? What\u2019s the solution space? And what are you good at? Aim to every day work in that sweet spot.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Zachary Tracer,Matthew A Winkler", "twitter": {"description": "The woman in charge of Barack Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul is counting down the days: She has 414 to go in the Obama administration.", "title": "The Woman Who Has 13 Months to Bolster Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/sylvia-burwell-counting-her-13-months-left-to-burnish-obamacare", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iIQ8PWOjs3zk/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Matthew A Winkler", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Law,Health,Barack H Obama,Sylvia Mathews Burwell", "news_keywords": "Law,Health,Barack H Obama,Sylvia Mathews Burwell", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/sylvia-burwell-counting-her-13-months-left-to-burnish-obamacare", "parsely-title": "The Woman Who Has 13 Months to Bolster Obamacare", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-12-04T10:00:00.003Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "The woman in charge of Barack Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul is counting down the days: She has 414 to go in the Obama administration.", "parsely-tags": "Law,Health,Barack H Obama,Sylvia Mathews Burwell,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-12-04T10:00:00.003Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "The woman in charge of Barack Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul is counting down the days: She has 414 to go in the Obama administration.", "title": "The Woman Who Has 13 Months to Bolster Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-04/sylvia-burwell-counting-her-13-months-left-to-burnish-obamacare", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iIQ8PWOjs3zk/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "The woman in charge of Barack Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul is counting down the days: She has 414 to go in the Obama administration."}, "parsely-post-id": "NYQTIU6K50XT01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iIQ8PWOjs3zk/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "The woman in charge of Barack Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul is counting down the days: She has 414 to go in the Obama administration.\nI\u2019m getting everything I can get done in that 13 months.\u201dThe stakes couldn\u2019t be higher for Obama and for Burwell, who will be 51 when the Obama administration comes to an end.\nHow Obamacare performs in the next 12 months could determine its fortunes.\nWe\u2019re all very aware of it now as we approach the last year,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Jacob J.
