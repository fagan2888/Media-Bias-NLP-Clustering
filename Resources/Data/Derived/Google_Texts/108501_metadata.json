Clad in khaki cargo pants and blue field shirts, some toted metal detectors attached to headphones. They worked slowly and deliberately, scanning the overgrown area, marking specific spots with dozens of small yellow flags. Agents used shovels on various select sites.\n\nLater, the agents were seen sifting some of the shoveled material. PBSO officials on site declined comment. They set up a white canvas tent as a temporary field base, as the task was expected to take many hours.\n\n+ Bill Ingram FBI agents sift through the ground near the scene of the Corey Jones shooting while other agents use measuring devices in ... read more Bill Ingram \u00d7\n\nThe son of a minister and grandson of a bishop, Jones was a drummer for the band the Future Prezidents. He was driving home from a performance in Jupiter that early Sunday morning when his SUV experienced mechanical problems. Jones called band mate Mathew Huntsberger for help. Huntsberger says he brought Jones a can of oil, but that didn\u2019t help. He says he left the drummer, who decided to wait for AT&T Roadside Assistance. About 45 minutes later, Jones was dead. What led to the shooting has not be revealed to the public.\n\nPolice say Officer Raja was not in uniform when he pulled up in an unmarked Ford van, thinking Jones\u2019 SUV was abandoned. Gardens police say Raja, who wore jeans and a t-shirt, was \u201csuddenly confronted by an armed subject.\u201d\n\nJones carried a gun, legally purchased just days before the shooting. That gun was found in the grassy area after the shooting. His family\u2019s lawyers say they\u2019ve learned he did not fire the gun.\n\n+ Palm Beach Sheriff's personnel gather with FBI agents near the scene of the Corey Jones shooting Saturday Oct. 24, 2015, in ... read more \u00d7\n\nOn Saturday morning, the federal agents scoured that area, attempting to piece together week-old clues. They worked in an area about a half block long and about three dozen feet wide, an long patch of grass separated from the rear parking lot of the Palm Beach Gardens Doubletree Hotel by a green chain-link fence.\n\nPossible objects of their search: bullets and casings from Officer Raja\u2019s gun. Raja fired six shots, hitting Jones three times, according to Jones\u2019 family\u2019s lawyer Benjamin Crump, who was briefed by State Attorney Dave Aronberg.\n\nAronberg announced Wednesday his office would conduct an independent investigation into the shooting.\n\nTwo days later, Sheriff Bradshaw announced he had asked the FBI to join his office\u2019s probe, saying \u201cI welcome their expertise and believe that this will ensure the highest level of scrutiny and impartiality.\u201d\n\nIn his Friday statement, Bradshaw, who has been sheriff for 10 years, went on to say: \u201cThere have been many lessons learned from the tragic events that have occurred across the United States and there is nothing more important, now, than a comprehensive investigation process so we can ensure justice is served.\u201d\n\nOnly once before has Bradshaw requested assistance in probing a police-involved shooting, and that was for the 2012 death of Seth Adams, an unarmed, 24-year-old Loxahatchee Groves man shot to death by a sheriff\u2019s deputy. At Bradshaw\u2019s request, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement reviewed the case. That agency cleared the deputy.\n\n+ Palm Beach Gardens police officer Nouman Raja was undercover that night, in plainclothes. \u00d7\n\nIn the Corey Jones inquiry, the FDLE\u2019s assistance was offered by Gov. Rick Scott, but no local agency has accepted the offer.\n\nThe case has generated a national cry for justice by the victim\u2019s family, national civil rights advocates and the local community.\n\n\u201cWhy does it take [Bradshaw] six days to make that decision,\u201d asked one of the Jones family attorneys, Daryl Parks, of a town hall meeting audience that gathered Friday night at the Tabernacle Missionary Baptist church in West Palm Beach.\n\n+ Corey Jones was 31 when he died. \u00d7\n\n+ Liz Balmaseda/Palm Beach Post Officers working Saturday at the I-95 exit where Corey Jones was killed.
