You\u2019d stand out in many ways, and deserve to be respected for your unique wisdom, perspective and experience. That\u2019s how unusual our Constitution is.\n\nAs we mark its 226th birthday on Sept. 17, its peers are getting younger all the time. Mila Versteeg from the University of Virginia has read every constitution enacted since World War II. That\u2019s 729 constitutions for 188 countries. Many of those nations, obviously, have had more than one constitution in that time. In fact, the average constitution lasts less than 20 years.\n\nSo what has allowed our Constitution to endure for centuries while its counterparts elsewhere are continually replaced? One key is that our Constitution is simple. It\u2019s small enough to fit in a pocket. It\u2019s written in clear language anyone can understand.\n\nIt\u2019s also limited in that it doesn\u2019t attempt to do too much. Most modern constitutions read as though they were laundry lists of \u201crights\u201d the government will \u201cgive\u201d to citizens. Over time, people come to expect the government to \u201cgive\u201d them more things, so the constitution needs to be thoroughly reworked, if not scrapped altogether.\n\nOur Constitution operates on a simpler plane. It creates a solid political framework and allows leaders and citizens to improvise within it.\n\nIt set up a federalist system of government, with powers carefully divided between the state and federal governments. Federalism protects local flexibility and autonomy, ensures that power is exercised at the closest and most accountable level possible, and creates competition by allowing states to take different approaches to policy problems. This \u201ccompetitive federalism\u201d expands citizens' freedom and encourages states to make good laws.\n\nOne key to the system is that it recognizes that human beings are not angels. Members of each branch will inevitably try to expand their power and influence, and members of the other two branches should then press back, leading to an ever-shifting balance of power that prevents any one branch from becoming too influential.\n\nUnfortunately, lawmakers have become increasingly comfortable handing over their powers to unelected bureaucrats. Laws such as Dodd-Frank and Obamacare are intentionally vague, leaving presidential appointees or career \u201ccivil servants\u201d to fill in the blanks. This can lead to abuses, such as when parts of Dodd-Frank are self-funding (thus dodging congressional oversight) and when bureaucrats grant exemptions to Obamacare\u2019s regulations.\n\nA solution would be for lawmakers to reassert their constitutional authority to make law. Congress should write clear and concise statutes, not vague, meandering bills. Every law should be as easy to read and understand as the Constitution itself.\n\nMeanwhile, members of each branch should interpret the Constitution by attempting to discern the original meaning of the text as it was written and publicly understood at the time of ratification, a method commonly referred to as originalism. Through originalism, officials would have to become better acquainted with the actual text and structure of the Constitution, and draw attention to its true purposes and principles.\n\nThere\u2019s been much discussion about \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d lately. We\u2019ve heard from the American president and the Russian one, and \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 they disagree on the concept. However, they\u2019re missing a very simple point: America is exceptional because it was founded on a creed. We know that all men are created equal, and our Constitution attempts to protect that equality here at home.\n\nNot perfectly. The fallible human beings entrusted to oversee its enforcement often make mistakes, but the document itself is the soundest constitution ever created.\n\nThat\u2019s why it will be around for an unprecedented 227th birthday next Sept. 17 \u2013 and for many more to come.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Birthdays take on a different character as we get older.
