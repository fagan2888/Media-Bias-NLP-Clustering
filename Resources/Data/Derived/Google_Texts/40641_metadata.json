Even its most ardent supporters aren\u2019t sure because it takes out $30 billion out of the Obamacare program with no replacement funding earmarked. Still, supporters of rolling back the tariff press on.\n\n\u201cI believe there is momentum building to address the tax,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican who is sponsoring one of several bills designed to repeal it. \u201cI can\u2019t forecast timing, but there\u2019s a real shot.\u201d\n\nThe medical-device tax has upset the apple cart for what has been a thriving sector within the health-care industry over the past decade and a half. Since the century\u2019s turn, makers of stents, artificial limbs, pacemakers and surgical gear have thrived.\n\nProfits have flourished for the largest companies in the sector such as Medtronic Inc. MDT, +0.65% , St. Jude Medical Inc. STJ, +0.50% and Stryker Corp. SYK, +1.17% , with net margins doubling in some cases. Last fiscal year, industry leader Medtronic saw its net profit margin exceed 20%, putting it on par with that of pharmaceutical giants. For companies like Medtronic, a company that enjoys margins that are quadruple that of most companies, the 2.3% tax on revenue may seem miniscule.\n\nEarnings Wall Discuss key earnings announcements before and after results come in.

Firms that projected smooth sailing just a few years ago are concerned those enviable profits will erode. For smaller companies that don\u2019t have near the same margins, many worry they\u2019ll be dead in the water before long.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how the tax was included in the Affordable Care Act in the first place \u2013 some believe it was an industry giveback developed specifically for device makers while others believe the ballooning margins on big players in this sector may have played a role.\n\nBut thousands of smaller device makers say the tariff would eat up most of their profits, if they have any, since it\u2019s a tax on sales and not just profits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actually borrowing money to pay the excise tax,\u201d said Tom Allen, chief executive of Iconacy Orthopedic Patients, a 13-employee start-up that makes orthopedic devices.\n\nIconacy is based in Warsaw, Ind., a small town about 40 miles west of Fort Wayne. Warsaw has become a nexus of sorts for dozens of small device makers, and a few large so-called \u201cmed tech\u201d companies such as privately held Biomet Inc.\n\nEconomic development officials in the region are concerned the tax will stifle the development of other companies in the burgeoning region. Other executives have trouble understanding how their industry could be targeted for an excise tax, which they say was a sloppy attempt to get med techs to contribute to Obamacare. Other means were used to get biopharmaceutical companies and their 20%-plus margins to contribute, but the device tax is seen as a more inelegant approach.\n\n\u201cI think of an excise tax as being for cigarettes or liquor, not on a maker of surgical implants for kids,\u201d said Mark Throdahl, chief executive of OrthoPediatrics, also based in Warsaw. As its name indicates, the firm makes devices geared specifically for children.\n\nThrodahl says if the tax were a tariff on income, it might be understandable \u2013 and more manageable for medical device makers. But all med techs are being hit with the same tax on sales, regardless of size or ability to turn a profit.\n\n\u201cIt just seems perverse,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re being held hostage to some political process in Washington. I think this is outrageous.\u201d\n\nThe sentiment is just as passionate nine hours northwest of Warsaw, in Minneapolis, which is home to Medtronic and 400 other device companies that employ roughly 35,000 people. The region is second only to California in number of med techs but first in concentration of firms with double the average of other metro areas.\n\nNow, however, there is concern that growth may be stunted, even stifled, if the tax persists. Locals say they\u2019re already seeing the effects of it.\n\n\u201cInvestment in med tech has just cratered. It\u2019s at an all-time low,\u201d said Shaye Mandle, executive vice president and chief operating officer of the trade group LifeScience Alley. He says there had been a drop in investment in recent years, but the tax \u201cput a cherry on top\u201d of that trend.\n\nNow he worries it will take too long to come out of it, with the tax looming overhead for prospective proprietors and investors.\n\n\u201cIf investment continues to be at this level, which is non-existent, you won\u2019t see a lot of companies,\u201d he said.\n\nOne glaring example of the tax\u2019s effect came from Kalamazoo, Mich.-based Stryker, which said in late 2012 that it would have to cut its workforce by nearly 1,200, due largely to the Obamacare excise tax. That reduction came even though Jon Stryker, grandson of the company\u2019s founder, has been a staunch Obama supporter.\n\nJ.C. Scott, chief lobbyist for the Advanced Medical Technology Association, the industry\u2019s trade group, says some companies are cutting back on research and development -- the life\u2019s blood for many companies in the industry. Others are going so far as to cut back on 401K matches, he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing it happen in a number of different ways,\u201d Scott said.\n\nHow might the tax get repealed? Rep. Dent\u2019s effort is part of a larger bill that seeks to strike a deal with Democrats over the tax and several other related \u2013 and unrelated \u2013 issues. Dent offers to extend unemployment benefits in exchange for repealing the tax, changing the definition of full-time workers as defined under Obamacare from 30 hours a week to 40 hours, and approving the controversial Keystone oil pipeline from Canada down through the middle of the U.S. to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nGaining consensus on this hodgepodge of issues may be too tall a task for this contentious Congress. Dent says repealing the tax, however, is a high priority.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep at it. If we can\u2019t repeal it [here] we\u2019ll try it some other way,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a job killer. It raises costs and it stifles innovation.\u201d\n\nOne potential problem is that attaching a repeal of the tax to other measures isn\u2019t popular with Senate Democrats, and in particular Majority Leader Harry Reid. When attempts were made to attach a repeal of the tax to measures that would have put the government back in business during its October shutdown, Reid nixed the idea as \u201cstupid.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokesman Jay Carney also said at the time that Obama would not sign a stopgap bill with a repeal of the medical-device tax attached to it.\n\nStill, there is a clear majority in the Senate that is opposed to the tax. Senators voted 79-20 last year to repeal the tax in non-binding resolution. Yet that points out another roadblock to a repeal \u2013 the resolution was non-binding because no solution on how to make up the $30 billion in lost Obamacare revenue has been found.\n\nRep. Erik Paulsen, a Minnesota Republican still is trying to get his legislation pushed through, nearly a year after introducing it on Feb. 6. Paulsen aides say the bill, H.R. 523, has 269 co-sponsors, including 41 Democrats.\n\n\u201cThe Congressman is still 100% committed to repealing the device tax and is actively pushing this legislation forward,\u201d Stacey Johnson, Paulsen\u2019s deputy chief of staff, said in an e-mail.\n\nAlso read: California\u2019s Obamacare program is close to meeting enrollment goal\n\nObamacare operations should have been centralized, expert contends\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "A tax on medical devices persists even though few in Congress want it, and the industry says it could hamper growth in coming years.", "creator": "@russbrittmktw", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS971_medtro_MG_20140121143103.jpg", "height": 398}, "site": {"id": 624413}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "parsely-author": "Russ Britt", "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "article.section": "Industries", "parsely-type": "post", "description": "A tax on medical devices persists even though few in Congress want it, and the industry says it could hamper growth in coming years.", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-obamacare-tax-that-nobody-wants-2014-01-22", "author": "Russ Britt", "parsely-title": "Despite bipartisan howls, medical-device tax persists", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-01-22T09:31:00-05:00", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Industries", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "A tax on medical devices persists even though few in Congress want it, and the industry says it could hamper growth in coming years.", "title": "Despite bipartisan howls, medical-device tax persists", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-obamacare-tax-that-nobody-wants-2014-01-22", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS971_medtro_MG_20140121143103.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BS971_medtro_MG_20140121143103.jpg"}, "article.id": "EE8BD6F2-82C2-11E3-A813-00212803FAD6", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb085\"", "article_summary": "Throdahl says if the tax were a tariff on income, it might be understandable \u2013 and more manageable for medical device makers.\n\u201cThe Congressman is still 100% committed to repealing the device tax and is actively pushing this legislation forward,\u201d Stacey Johnson, Paulsen\u2019s deputy chief of staff, said in an e-mail.\nOther means were used to get biopharmaceutical companies and their 20%-plus margins to contribute, but the device tax is seen as a more inelegant approach.\nFor companies like Medtronic, a company that enjoys margins that are quadruple that of most companies, the 2.3% tax on revenue may seem miniscule.\nBut thousands of smaller device makers say the tariff would eat up most of their profits, if they have any, since it\u2019s a tax on sales and not just profits."}
