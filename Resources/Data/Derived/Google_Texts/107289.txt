Yankton, SD

Six graduates of Mount Marty College are suing the Yankton school after learning its nurse practitioner's program failed to earn accreditation.



The liberal arts college learned May 19 the program will be denied accreditation by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education. That was five months after the first class in the program graduated.



Those 18 students and another graduate from May now cannot be licensed as nurse practitioners. The Argus Leader reports they can complete coursework at a different school to earn an accredited degree.



Six of the 19 graduates sued Friday in Minnehaha County. The college announced the accreditation issue Thursday.



The lawsuit argues the school didn't tell students it didn't obtain preapproval from an accrediting agency and implied the program was accredited.
