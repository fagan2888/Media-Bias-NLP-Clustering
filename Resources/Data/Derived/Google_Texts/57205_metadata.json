Like many Indians then, he viewed the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) as a fringe group.\n\nNow 43, Shaha is a recent RSS recruit in Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal. He joined about 50 volunteers for an indoctrination meeting last year at that same car park near RSS headquarters in Kolkata. As dusk set in, they sat cross-legged on a faded rug before a statue of Bharat Mata, a representation of India in the form of a mother goddess.\n\nRamapada Pal, the RSS\u2019s chief preacher in the state, espoused a message of Hindu supremacy. Everyone must acknowledge \u201cthe superiority of the Hindu kingdom,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf a Muslim living in India chooses their god before India, then why should he be allowed to live in our country? This country belongs to Hindus first.\u201d\n\nThe RSS says its membership is growing. RSS Joint General Secretary Dattatreya Hosabale predicted the number of RSS branches in West Bengal would rise to 1,200 next year from 650 in 2013. There is no independent measure of RSS membership.\n\nThe group\u2019s message has particular resonance in West Bengal, which borders Bangladesh. An influx of Bangladeshi immigrants has boosted the number of Muslims, who now make up 27 per cent of the population in West Bengal, an interior ministry official said. Hindus remain a majority, but their share of the population declined by 2.2 percentage points between the 2001 and 2011 census.\n\n'FEASTING ON OUR RESOURCES'\n\nRahul Sinha, the BJP\u2019s head in the state, said the RSS was the \u201cguiding force in a war to win the ancient Hindu soul of India.\u201d\n\n\u201cMuslims are coming from Bangladesh and feasting on our resources,\u201d he said. \u201cNew mosques and madrassas have been set up in every corner.\"\n\nShaha, the new RSS recruit, said he turned to the RSS last July after his niece married a Muslim and converted to Islam, shaming his well-to-do family. \"I had to protect my Hindu roots \u2013 they had been threatened,\u201d he said.\n\nThe RSS talked to him about reconverting his niece, but Shaha said the move was blocked when she threatened to lodge a police complaint against her family if they tried to interfere in her personal life.\n\nShaha said he campaigned for the BJP in the municipal elections this year and was ready to do the same for the party in next year's state election.\n\n\"My mission is to make India a Hindu nation,\u201d he said.\n\n(Editing by Bill Tarrant.)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "KOLKATA \u2013 (Reuters) - As a teenager, Uttam Shaha says he used to watch scornfully from", "title": "New recruits to Hindu cause hear anti-Muslim message", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/12/New-recruits-Hindu-cause-hear-anti-Muslim-message", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/india-rss_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/12/New-recruits-Hindu-cause-hear-anti-Muslim-message", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/india-rss_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "KOLKATA \u2013 (Reuters) - As a teenager, Uttam Shaha says he used to watch scornfully from", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5b7b\"", "article_summary": "The group\u2019s message has particular resonance in West Bengal, which borders Bangladesh.\nNow 43, Shaha is a recent RSS recruit in Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal.\nRamapada Pal, the RSS\u2019s chief preacher in the state, espoused a message of Hindu supremacy.\nRSS Joint General Secretary Dattatreya Hosabale predicted the number of RSS branches in West Bengal would rise to 1,200 next year from 650 in 2013.\nAn influx of Bangladeshi immigrants has boosted the number of Muslims, who now make up 27 per cent of the population in West Bengal, an interior ministry official said."}
