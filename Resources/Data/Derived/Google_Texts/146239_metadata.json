Martin O'Malley while supporting Marylanders for Marriage Equality.\n\nFans often think of sports as place walled off from politics, an outlet from the real world where everything going on around us doesn\u2019t matter. But our sports leagues are inherently political \u2014 they lobby! \u2014 and our athletes are people, living, breathing humans with opinions and views on the world. Sports are inherently political, as you\u2019ll see from this far-from-comprehensive list of political statements the sports world made in 2013:\n\nAthletes speak out for LGBT rights: From high school to the pros, athletes have spoken out in favor of LGBT rights throughout 2013, recording videos for groups like You Can Play, showing support for athletes like Jason Collins, Robbie Rogers, and Brittney Griner, or joining groups like Athlete Ally. While much of their advocacy has remained rooted in sports, several have gone farther. Football players Chris Kluwe and Brendon Ayanbadejo, for instance, co-authored a brief to the Supreme Court to oppose Proposition 8, the California law banning marriage equality that was eventually overturned. And Kenneth Faried of the Denver Nuggets, whose moms are gay, recorded his own video supporting marriage equality.\n\nThe sports world honors Mandela: Around the world, sports leagues honored Nelson Mandela when the former South African president and global political icon died in December. The English Premier League held a moment of silence before each match the next weekend, and countless athletes paid tribute in their own ways. The New York Yankees announced that they would honor Mandela, who spoke at Yankee Stadium on his first American tour after his release from prison, with a memorial in the stadium\u2019s Monument Park.\n\nSergio Romo pushes for immigration reform: Sergio Romo made a statement about immigration reform in 2012 when he wore a t-shirt reading \u201cI Just Look Illegal\u201d during the San Francisco Giants\u2019 World Series parade. This year, Romo, a Mexican-American, recorded a video specifically calling for immigration reform. \u201cWhen I hear of a student being undocumented, I take it as kids going to school and trying to learn to get better. I don\u2019t see any negative in that,\u201d Romo said. \u201cThey deserve a chance to live their dream, and we all win if they do.\u201d\n\nDwyane Wade and sons stand up for Trayvon: After George Zimmerman was acquitted in the Trayvon Martin murder trial, Dwyane Wade appeared on the cover of Ebony magazine with his sons, Zaire and Zion, with all three donning hoodies. Wade had previously posed, hood up, with his Miami Heat teammates, and his action around the Trayvon case \u2014 \u201cWe are all Trayvon,\u201d the Ebony cover read \u2014 was a powerful statement from a prominent African-American athlete at a time when such a statement was needed.\n\nAaron Rodgers speaks out for Congo: In October, Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers spoke at event at the University of Wisconsin to raise awareness about the effect of conflict minerals on the people of Congo. Students at Wisconsin and other schools are trying to make their campuses \u201cconflict free,\u201d meaning they don\u2019t buy any products that use conflict diamonds or other minerals, and the former MVP (and adopted son of Wisconsin) used his platform to push the cause.\n\nNeymar supports Brazilian protests: With his home country erupting in protests over government corruption and spending on the World Cup, Brazil\u2019s biggest soccer star stood up in support. \u201cI\u2019m Brazilian and I love my country. I have a family and friends who live in Brazil. For that reason, I want a Brazil which is more just, safer, healthier and more honest,\u201d Neymar said. \u201d \u201cI\u2019m sad about what is happening in Brazil. I also had faith that it would not be necessary to get to the point of going on to the streets to demand better transport, health, education and safety, which is the government\u2019s obligation.\u201d\n\nAthletes support equality in Sochi: A long list of athletes who will appear at the Sochi Olympics next year made their opinions known about Russia\u2019s new anti-gay law, even as Olympic officials refused to do anything about it. The biggest challenge came from American distance runner Nick Symmonds, who won a medal at the Track and Field World Championships in Moscow and then dedicated the medal to his LGBT friends back at home.\n\nBaseball players fight for workers: In May, the MLB Players Association offered support to organized workers who were fighting their employer \u2014 which manufactures MLB uniforms \u2014 over health care benefits. \u201cNow is the time for all of you to stick together so that you can achieve your goal as well: a fair contract with good wages, good health care and respect on the job,\u201d the union said in a letter to workers. \u201cWe take seriously our role as a union,\u201d the late Michael Weiner, then the head of the MLBPA, said of the help. Less than three weeks later, the workers reached an agreement that preserved their health benefits and gave them a raise.\n\nTeams support Obamacare: The NFL and NBA both denied opportunities to partner with the White House to promote Obamacare, but individual teams helped out. The Baltimore Ravens and Pittsburgh Steelers both planned enrollment events to help promote the law, while the Washington Nationals\u2019 Teddy Roosevelt mascot and the D.C. United both promoted the new health care law as well.\n\nNike goes to bat for marriage equality: Nike has organized its own advocacy efforts around LGBT equality, releasing its #BeTrue clothing line, donating proceeds to the LGBT Sports Coalition, and signing openly gay athletes like Jason Collins and Brittney Griner to endorsement deals. It went even farther in Oregon, where the company is based, putting its support behind a constitutional amendment ballot initiative that would overturn the state\u2019s ban on marriage equality. It\u2019s biggest competitor in the apparel world \u2014 Adidas \u2014 also supports the amendment.\n\nLeagues talk climate change: All four major American sports leagues plus the U.S. Olympic Committee spoke out about the dangers climate change pose to the planet and their leagues in 2013, sending letters to members of Congress and appearing in November on Capitol Hill, where they met with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA), two proponents of climate change initiatives. \u201cI think we\u2019ve shown that we do support the EPA programs by joining up and partnering with them on many of their programs,\u201d an NBA representative said.\n\nAthletes complain about taxes: Hate paying taxes? Athletes like golfer Phil Mickelson and boxer Manny Pacquiao are with you. Both complained about the amount of taxes they owed on their winnings, which totaled in the millions of dollars. Conservative groups tried to make their problems seem indicative of broader tax policy issues in America. But as we explained, Mickelson and Pacquiao\u2019s complaints don\u2019t actually prove anything wrong with American tax policy.\n\nThe Dolphins form a PAC: After the Florida state legislature tabled a proposal that would give the Miami Dolphins hundreds of millions of dollars to renovate Sun Life Stadium, Dolphins owner Stephen Ross had a plan: he started a political action committee that he will use to target opponents of the public financing plan. It\u2019s a strategy we said would be likely more than a year ago, and we\u2019ll see in 2014 whether it can work.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Athletes spoke out on a number of political topics in 2013.
