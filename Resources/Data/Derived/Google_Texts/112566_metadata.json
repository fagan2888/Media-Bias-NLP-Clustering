The recent expansion of electric, hybrid and natural gas powered-vehicles that pay little or no gas tax has aggravated the problem.\n\n..\n\nPlaces such as Oregon will track drivers' annual mileage and then charge a per-mile fee, but that becomes complicated with out-of-state travel and the need for record keeping, and it requires a $200 GPS tracking device.\n\n..\n\nCommission member Rep. Norman Major , R-Plaistow, asked Legislative Services to produce a bill that would charge what is being called a \u201croad usage fee\u201d to be assessed against the owners of fuel efficient vehicles whether they burn gasoline, diesel, propane, natural gas or are powered by electricity.\n\n..\n\nMajor, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, developed a formula that would replace some of the lost revenue due to fuel efficiency or alternative fuels.\n\n\n\nThe formula is meant to replace what the state would have collected in gas taxes if all vehicles had fuel efficiency ratings of 20 miles per gallon or less.\n\n..\n\nConsequently, the higher the miles-per-gallon rating for a vehicle, the more the road usage fee.\n\n\n\nThe road usage fee would increase for every 5 miles-per-gallon greater efficiency up to 51 miles-per-gallon and beyond. Under the preliminary proposal, a vehicle that does not burn gas would be charged at the same rate as those operating up to or surpassing 51 miles-per-gallon.\n\n..\n\nLawmakers would decide what the average miles driven would be. It could be 15,000 miles annually and everyone would be charged at that rate.\n\n\n\nSo, if your vehicle is U.S. Department of Transportation certified to operate at between 20 and 25 miles per gallon, then you would pay a road usage fee of $33. Other steps would be 26 to 30 mpg, $55.50; 31 to 35, $71.36 and on up to $166.50 at the top end.\n\n..\n\nThe fee would increase if lawmakers decided to use 20,000 miles annually as the base, or decrease if the base is 10,000 miles.\n\n\n\nThe system would link the USDOT mileage estimates for a vehicle model with the vehicle identification number of each auto, and the fee would be collected by a town or city clerk when a person registers his or her vehicle.\n\n..\n\nMajor, along with state safety officials, says the plan would raise between $35 million and $50 million a year for the Highway Fund, with the money dedicated to roads and bridges, with 12 percent of the money raised going to local roads and bridges.\n\n..\n\nTwo years ago, lawmakers fought about increasing the gas tax just over 4 cents and any attempt to up that levy again faces rock solid opposition from Senate President Chuck Morse , R-Salem.\n\n\n\nHow House and Senate leaders view Major's proposal remains to be seen once the bill is printed and the ramifications are more apparent.\n\n..\n\nBut Major, like most people in the state, knows that the state's crumbling transportation infrastructure needs all the help it can get or it will be even more expensive in the future to repair years of neglect.\n\n..\n\n\n\n\n\nMedicaid expansion\n\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest battle brewing for next session is reauthorizing the Medicaid Expansion program under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nCurrently, there are about 42,000 adults receiving health insurance through the program. Gov. Maggie Hassan , who wanted the program reauthorized in the budget, agreed to back off when GOP legislative leaders promised it would be debated early in the 2016 session.\n\n..\n\nThe program is scheduled to end Dec. 31, 2016, when the federal government decreases its share of the costs from 100 to 95 percent.\n\n\n\nThe change will cost the state about $12 million to $14 million in the 2017 fiscal year of the current biennium.\n\n..\n\nAt the beginning of this year's session, House leadership was adamant the program would not be reauthorized because there was little if any support among Republican House members.\n\n\n\nBut after the recent budget agreement, the tune began to change as House Speaker Shawn Jasper , R-Hudson, said taxpayers should not have to pick up the tab for what the federal government does not pay.\n\n..\n\nThat is not the same as saying it will not pass the House.\n\n\n\nThe trick will be finding money to pay the state's share without raising taxes, something not many politicians want to do in the run up to an election.\n\n..\n\nLook for lawmakers to find a way to use some of the Medicaid Enhancement Tax money that currently goes back to the hospitals. It's the hospitals that pay the levy to fund the expansion program.\n\n\n\nOne of the key reasons Medicaid expansion garnered GOP support two years ago was that it would reduce the amount of unpaid health care services hospitals must provide.\n\n..\n\nCalled the hidden tax, hospitals shift the cost for those \u201cfree\u201d services to insurance companies that in turn charge higher premiums.\n\n\n\nIf in fact hospitals' uncompensated care costs go down under expansion as early indications appear to show, then hospitals may not need all their Medicaid Enhancement Tax money to be returned.\n\n..\n\nOriginally, the tax was assessed against hospitals, used to match federal money and then returned to the hospitals. Some adjustments were made to tie the money returned to actual care provided, but in the 2012-13 budget, the state kept about half the money for other things, which resulted in two lawsuits.\n\n..\n\nA settlement was reached a year-and-a-half ago after the state lost the two lawsuits that returned almost all the money collected to hospitals.\n\n\n\nThe numbers are being parsed now, but look for the MET to be the savior for a Medicaid expansion program that looked all but dead several months ago.\n\n..\n\nThrowing 42,000 people off health insurance in an election year is not something politicians want to do if they can help it.\n\n\n\nProperty liability trust\n\n\n\nThe battle continues between the Bureau of Securities Regulation and the remnants of the Local Government Center's insurance business.\n\n..\n\nAt issue is the Property Liability Trust's petition to issue new policies or renew ones, which was filed June 30.\n\n\n\nThe pooled risk insurer of local governments agreed last summer not to issue new policies while addressing existing or future claims it was obligated to cover.\n\n..\n\nLast spring, the trust asked to sell new policies and renew existing ones again but withdrew that request when it became obvious the bureau was not going to grant the request.\n\n\n\nThe trust filed another petition to begin selling policies again, and on Tuesday the final hearing on the petition begins at 9 p.m. at the state archives building on Fruit Street.\n\n..\n\nThe hearing will continue Wednesday and Friday if necessary.\n\n\n\nThe trust attempted to have jurisdiction moved from the bureau, which is under Secretary of State Bill Gardner 's Office, to the Insurance Department in a last minute amendment to the budget trailer bill, but instead a committee was established to determine which agency would regulate the trust.\n\n..\n\nBudget surplus\n\n\n\nThe governor released the final unaudited financials for the 2015 fiscal year, which ended June 30, last week at the deadline Sept. 30.\n\n\n\nThe figures showed a $73.2 million surplus, which was about $10 million more than assumed in the budget that was eventually enacted last month.\n\n..\n\nHouse and Senate budget writers used the surplus to fund $49 million of the current biennium while putting $14.5 million in the rainy day fund.\n\n\n\nThe additional money could go into the rainy day fund or as Hassan suggested lawmakers may want to look at the education aid that will be reduced in the second year of the biennium for many school districts, while fast growing districts like Bedford, Dover and Pelham get more money.\n\n..\n\nA cap on enrollment growth has prevented the fast-growing districts from receiving all the money they are due under the existing distribution formula.\n\n\n\nDover sued over the cap and the case is pending in Stafford County Superior Court.\n\n..\n\nPartisan conferences\n\n\n\nThe Legislative Ethics Committee ruled recently that lawmakers can accept free room and board from partisan political committees.\n\n\n\nSenate legal counsel Richard Lehmann asked for a committee opinion on behalf of Morse and Senate Majority Leader Jeb Bradley , R-Wolfeboro, if they could accept free room and board to attend the Republican Legislative Campaign Committee.\n\n..\n\n\u201cAccording to the information submitted by Attorney Lehmann, the Senators attended the conference in Boston, Mass., for two days and two nights, and participated in briefings with elected officials from other states, policy roundtables, and various receptions. The policy roundtables and briefings featured such topics as U.S. energy policy, private market solutions to modernize Medicaid, and cyber security,\u201d according to the opinion from committee chair former House Speaker Donna Sytek . \u201cBased on the information provided by Attorney Lehmann about the conference's purpose and activities, the event, as described, qualifies as a bona fide conference, meeting, seminar or educational program.\u201d\n\n..\n\nBut Sytek said, the two senators have to report the reimbursement for the conference.\n\n\n\ngrayno@unionleader.com\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "A commission studying alternative ways besides a gas tax to raise money for the Highway Fund will discuss on Friday a proposal that would target all fuel-efficient vehicles.", "title": "Garry Rayno's State House Dome: Commission will discuss a proposal to tax fuel-efficient vehicles to raise money for highway fund | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "A commission studying alternative ways besides a gas tax to raise money for the Highway Fund will discuss on Friday a proposal that would target all fuel-efficient vehicles.", "title": "Garry Rayno's State House Dome: Commission will discuss a proposal to tax fuel-efficient vehicles to raise money for highway fund | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20151004/NEWS0604/151009684/0/SEARCH", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/images/unionleaderlogo.jpg", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "State House Dome", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "keywords": "Energy, Transportation,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2015-10-04 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "A commission studying alternative ways besides a gas tax to raise money for the Highway Fund will discuss on Friday a proposal that would target all fuel-efficient vehicles.", "title": "Garry Rayno's State House Dome: Commission will discuss a proposal to tax fuel-efficient vehicles to raise money for highway fund | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20151004/NEWS0604/151009684/0/SEARCH", "image": "http://www.unionleader.com/images/unionleaderlogo.jpg", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4597\"", "article_summary": "Garry Rayno's State House Dome: Commission will discuss a proposal to tax fuel-efficient vehicles to raise money for highway fundA COMMISSION studying alternative ways besides a gas tax to raise money for the Highway Fund will discuss on Friday a proposal that would target all fuel-efficient vehicles.\nThe recent expansion of electric, hybrid and natural gas powered-vehicles that pay little or no gas tax has aggravated the problem.\n..Called the hidden tax, hospitals shift the cost for those \u201cfree\u201d services to insurance companies that in turn charge higher premiums.\n..Look for lawmakers to find a way to use some of the Medicaid Enhancement Tax money that currently goes back to the hospitals.\n..Two years ago, lawmakers fought about increasing the gas tax just over 4 cents and any attempt to up that levy again faces rock solid opposition from Senate President Chuck Morse , R-Salem."}
