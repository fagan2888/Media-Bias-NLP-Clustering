She took umbrage, saying she was not trying to control the interview: \u201cI was trying not to be put in a position to prove I was a psychic. It was more to explain to you my journey.\u201d\n\nHer journey now includes a book, \u201cThe Psychic Housewives\u2019 Handbook,\u201d which she promoted during a recent appearance at Holistic Edge Expo. Roe wanted to do a psychic reading about me instead of answering the questions I was asking. I told her I wouldn\u2019t trust her reading 1) because I am a skeptic and 2) because I have been the subject of enough profiles that she could talk about things I\u2019ve forgotten that have been written in magazines.\n\nAt the end of our verbal tussle, I let Roe tell me what she was dying to say by way of a reading: \u201cYou were a bratty child. I\u2019m getting bratty energy from you now.\u201d\n\nDespite my adult personality, I told Roe SHE WAS WRONG! We went around and around on this. She claimed my grandmother was talking to her, although she couldn\u2019t identify my great-grandmother was when shown a photo.\n\nSo I did an investigation. I put the brat question to my mother, my favorite brutally honest aunt, my sixth-grade teacher, Mrs. Cross, and a church member who knew me as a child, Mrs. Cochran.\n\nLorraine Roe\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you were a bratty child,\u201d said Mrs. Cochran, of Albany, Ga., on Thursday, conveying the consensus of all those interviewed on the matter.\n\nLorraine, believe whatever you must.\n\nThree of the four did, however, agree with Roe about this: \u201cI think your audience does not understand how funny you are.\u201d\n\nThere is no need for readers to know how wildly inappropriate I am.\n\nQ Do you have to retire your healthy reporter\u2019s skepticism to become a psychic?\n\nA Not at all. I totally brought it with me. I go to interview the other side and I come back, is how I operate.\n\nQ Tell me why being a psychic isn\u2019t hokum practiced by most people who pursue this career path?\n\nA C.J., just tell me what the question is, just tell me! Right here, baby, tell me the question!\n\nQ How many kids does Adrian Peterson have?\n\nA I don\u2019t know. Are you asking me about a human? Is this a psychic question? Ask me a real question.\n\nQ Who will be in Super Bowl 2014?\n\nA I don\u2019t watch football, except I watch the Vikings once in a while.\n\nQ How about a stock tip? (Attempt to redirect the interview No. 1, coming up.)\n\nA Let me tell you about you?\n\nQ I know about me. Besides, I\u2019ve been featured in plenty of magazine interviews, the contents of which I have forgotten, that you could have read as research to wow me.\n\nA I haven\u2019t looked at any of the articles about you.\n\nQ What scares you?\n\nA I get scared at real haunted houses. If there\u2019s a spooky house, I get scared, seriously.\n\nQ My problem with Halloween is that it seems to make light of death, which looks fairly heavy to me. Help me see another perspective.\n\nA It\u2019s also about celebrating death, because it\u2019s also around the Day of the Dead ... we\u2019re celebrating people we\u2019ve lost. They say the veil gets thin so you can actually talk to the dead relatives more easily than you could at other times. At one time, using Halloween costumes was to scare away spirits. But now it\u2019s more considered, in spiritual terms, the thinning of the veil. It\u2019s the easier way to talk to your dead relatives.\n\nQ Do you see dead people?\n\nA I do, but it\u2019s not my primary thing. I do psychological profiles of people so they can get on their own path.\n\nQ Who was the last dead person you saw?\n\nA Someone\u2019s father in a reading. It was on a radio station in Mankato. I did an interview in Mankato and her dead relative came in.\n\nQ Do spirits ever tell you information that\u2019s unrepeatable?\n\nA Yes, absolutely.\n\nQ Is there anything tasteless about \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d providing essentially a map of the resting places of dearly departed celebrities for Halloween?\n\nA OF COURSE, it\u2019s totally tasteless! It\u2019s Hollywood. You\u2019ve got to go there.\n\nQ You knew I was coming today, so you had time to collect information about me that has been in magazine stories? (Attempt to redirect the interview No. 2, coming up.)\n\nA I would rather you ask me a personal question.\n\nQ Telling me something about me really doesn\u2019t mean anything to me. Tell me something about this little old lady? (I showed her a photo of my great-grandmother.)\n\nA I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t work that way. What are you trying to do? Are you trying to get me to prove I\u2019m psychic? You are. I\u2019m a former reporter and I know how it goes. When I was a reporter, nobody could have proved to me psychic ability. So I don\u2019t try to prove it. People become psychic. I give psychic readings. I\u2019m going to plug this. I have a book that\u2019s about your own psychic abilities. I think if you are a trusted and respected psychic, you have people around who love you and support you and you have clientele. And that\u2019s how I roll. Having been a former newsy and investigative reporter, it\u2019s a big calling to come out as a psychic. It\u2019s not that easy. But I have always lived in my authenticity and my integrity. Now I am building to bigger things, because I believe people have these abilities, to have good intuition and be psychic.\n\nQ What makes you think you\u2019re psychic?\n\nA I\u2019ll tell you my story. A grandma came to me suddenly, after I had left KSTP and returned to Los Angeles, and told me all these vivid details and [gave me a picture] of her grandson. It was a boy in a peach orchard, and I knew who it was. It was a medical doctor friend of mine. And I called him up and said, \u2018Does this ring any bells? Was this part of your childhood?\u2019 and it did. It was him as a child in striped shirt holding a bucket of peaches. It started building up from there, where I would just know things. Look at today. I flew out of LAX, five hours before the shooting. Why? Because I used my intuition to pick my flight. I guess I made \u2019em [reservations] about a week before.\n\nQ You had an intuition something bad was going to happen at LAX?\n\nA No, I had an intuition not to fly that early in the morning. I flew out at 1 in the morning and the shooting was that morning like 8 or 9. I never take a red-eye. So that is what I am talking about with intuition and psychic ability. Psychic means knowing, and I say knowing God. You really know the energy of things.\n\nInterviews are edited.
