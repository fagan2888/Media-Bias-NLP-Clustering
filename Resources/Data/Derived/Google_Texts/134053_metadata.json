So were Gregory Rothrock and his family. Yet, their insurance must change, and it will cost them more money.\n\nThe individual insurance plans Hare and Rothrock bought from Presbyterian Healthcare Services will become illegal under the act, also known as Obamacare, starting Jan. 1.\n\nPresbyterian, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico, and Lovelace Health Plan all sell individual insurance and have each come up with a strategy to keep individual insurance customers while complying with the ACA.\n\nPresbyterian is offering a new insurance product to the 23,000 members who have purchased an individual plan in the past, but for only one more year. Presbyterian will stop offering that plan after 2014. Those members who don\u2019t want the plan are encouraged to purchase individual insurance on the federal health insurance exchange.\n\nTodd Sandman, Presbyterian vice president of strategy and customer engagement, said the company wanted to offer \u201ca transitional plan\u201d that would let customers who are not ready to try the exchange remain in an individual plan for one more year. Only current members can buy the transitional plan.\n\nMaternity coverage\n\nHare said his individual plan now costs him $87 a month and has a $5,000 deductible. The new plan will cost $211 and includes benefits, such as maternity coverage, that are required by the ACA but which Hare doesn\u2019t want.\n\nHare \u2013 a single, male, 48-year-old software developer \u2013 couldn\u2019t have had that coverage in the past anyway, since none of the companies offering individual insurance in New Mexico provided a maternity benefit.\n\nAs for Rothrock, depending on which of the three levels of coverage he chooses, coverage for his family of three could be as much as 360 percent more costly. Rothrock, a 59-year-old independent financial adviser, said he also doesn\u2019t have any use for ACA-required maternity coverage, since his wife is 52.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this about being able to keep your own insurance if you like it?\u201d he asked.\n\nLovelace Health Plan, which has 2,900 members covered through individual plans, is simply going to cancel the plans at year\u2019s end and work to get people to buy ACA-compliant individual products on the exchange or directly from Lovelace.\n\nComplying immediately\n\n\u201cWe felt we\u2019d just immediately comply with all the provisions\u201d of the act, said Lovelace Health Plan Chief Programs Officer Marlene Baca.\n\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico is confronting the issue somewhat differently. The company has 18,000 individual members in what are known as grandfathered plans. These are plans that were in place before March 2010, when ACA became law, and are not required to meet the act\u2019s coverage requirements, known as essential benefits, provided Blue Cross does not change any of the benefits offered in those grandfathered plans.\n\nAnother 10,000 are in individual plans that were offered after March 2010. These nongrandfathered plans already meet ACA coverage requirements.\n\nBlue Cross will continue offering the grandfathered plans for the foreseeable future, but nongrandfathered plans will be required to meet ACA actuarial requirements in 2014. In simplest terms, that means the plans have to be designed to cover a minimum of 60 percent of the customer\u2019s medical costs.\n\nThey must also stop medical underwriting of individual plans, which means they can no longer refuse to sell insurance to people with medical problems. They must instead guarantee they will issue insurance to everyone regardless of health status.\n\nBeating Jan. 1 deadline\n\nBlue Cross will skirt these requirements by changing the renewal date of nongrandfathered plans to Dec. 1. Plans in effect on that date don\u2019t have to comply with ACA actuarial and guaranteed issue rules until Dec. 1, 2014.\n\nBlue Cross will cancel the nongrandfathered individual plans Dec. 1 next year and encourage members to buy exchange and other products. No new members will be accepted into existing individual plans.\n\nJanice Torrez, vice president of external affairs, said the plan will cost 9.2 percent more than it does this year, but that includes ACA-required fees.\n\n\u201cThe plan gives those members just a little bit more time,\u201d Torrez said. \u201cWe knew there\u2019d be a lot of questions and confusion. These folks will have more time to decide whether to go to an exchange product, to go off the exchange, or stay put for a while.\u201d\n\nCompanies that offer individual plans have struggled for years to make money with them while controlling premium increases. Presbyterian and Blue Cross have raised premiums on these plans more than 20 percent in some years.\n\n\u2018Very costly\u2019 plans\n\n\u201cThis book of business is very costly,\u201d Torrez said, noting the 9.2 percent premium increase doesn\u2019t cover the escalation in health care costs.\n\nSandman said that even without ACA coverage requirements going into effect in Presbyterian\u2019s new offering, premiums would have increased in the coming year simply because the cost of medical care for members has been increasing.\n\nOver time, Blue Cross expects members to drop even the grandfathered plans. Torrez said most have remained in those plans, despite ever-rising prices, because they couldn\u2019t get an insurance company to sell them another less expensive product.\n\nThese members will likely find that new ACA-compliant products are better and less expensive, Torrez said, especially if they qualify for subsidies offered by the federal government to purchasers earning as much as 400 percent of the federal poverty level.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. \u2014 Some plans may swap out to comply with new rules", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Winthrop Quigley | Journal Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.abqjournal.com/281020/changes-ahead-even-for-happily-insured.html", "image": "http://www.abqjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CapBuilding-1000x742.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Some plans may swap out to comply with new rules", "title": "Updated: Insurance changes ahead, even for happily insured"}, "fb": {"pages": 76430478236, "app_id": 419447351433280}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Those members who don\u2019t want the plan are encouraged to purchase individual insurance on the federal health insurance exchange.\nThe individual insurance plans Hare and Rothrock bought from Presbyterian Healthcare Services will become illegal under the act, also known as Obamacare, starting Jan. 1.\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico is confronting the issue somewhat differently.\nPresbyterian, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico, and Lovelace Health Plan all sell individual insurance and have each come up with a strategy to keep individual insurance customers while complying with the ACA.\nMaternity coverageHare said his individual plan now costs him $87 a month and has a $5,000 deductible."}
