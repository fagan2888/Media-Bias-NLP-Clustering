There is also concern that some ads are leaving out risk information.\n\nA possible solution, FDA said would be to limit the risks listed in the statements and include a disclosure alert to let consumers know there are other side effects not listed in the ad.\n\nFor example, the ad would say, \u201cThis is not a full list of risks and side effects. Talk to your doctor and read the patient labeling for more information.\u201d\n\n\"Our primary hypothesis is that, relative to inclusion of the full major statement, providing limited risk information along with the disclosure about additional risks will promote improved consumer perception and understanding of serious and actionable drug risks,\" FDA said in its notice in the Federal Register.\n\nFDA\u2019s Office of Prescription Drug Promotion plans to investigate the effectiveness of the \u201climited risks plus disclosure\u201d strategy by having a sample of adults, who self-identify as having been diagnosed with depression, high cholesterol or insomnia, watch ads for drugs pertaining to their diagnosis and answer questions about the information in the ad.\n\nFDA is waiting for the Office of Management and Budget to sign off on the study.
