According to a blog post, 52 entities, including 28 rural and critical access hospitals, 42 rural health clinics, 12 federally qualified health centers, and 9 private physician practices in 30 rural health systems across 9 states, were able to use the Consortium\u2019s collaborative model to afford and qualify for the Medicare Shared Savings Program.\n\nThe model services 65,000 attributed Medicare beneficiaries from Texas, California, Washington, Iowa, Indiana, Missouri, Oregon, Illinois, and Michigan, under the care of 1,300 clinicians. The Consortium\u2019s newest ACOs include National Rural ACO, Reid ACO, Suburban Health ACO, American Rural ACO, Northwest Rural ACO, and National Rural ACO II.\n\nAmong the Consortium\u2019s comprehensive services are claims data access and analysis, evidence-based medicine leadership, care coordination coaching, and governance, legal, and compliance services.\n\nThe Consortium's unique model of collaboration is the first of its kind to enable rural providers to receive higher reimbursement for improving the care they deliver, Tim Putnam, CEO of Margaret Mary Hospital in Batesville, IN and board chair for the first National Rural ACO, said in a press release. We can access the same type of powerful data, waivers, and programs that urban ACO's can for about the same cost as it would be to hire one person to figure out how to get into the program.\n\nThe Consortium provides comprehensive services including claims data access and analysis, evidence-based medicine leadership, care coordination coaching and the governance, legal and compliance services needed to succeed.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "<p>There are now 30 rural health systems participating in six ACOs across nine U.S. states.&nbsp;<em>By Christine Kern, contributing writer</em></p>", "creator": "Christine Kern", "image": {"src": "http://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/a7adeb64/a7adeb64-611b-4439-94cc-4bdda2c2559d/handshake2.jpg"}, "title": "National Rural Accountable Care Consortium Adds 5 ACOs", "site": "HITOutcomes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "There are now 30 rural health systems participating in six ACOs across nine U.S. states.&nbsp;By Christine Kern, contributing writer", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "Title": "National Rural Accountable Care Consortium Adds 5 ACOs"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf69d\"", "article_summary": "The Consortium\u2019s newest ACOs include National Rural ACO, Reid ACO, Suburban Health ACO, American Rural ACO, Northwest Rural ACO, and National Rural ACO II.\nNational Rural Accountable Care Consortium Adds 5 ACOsBy Christine Kern, contributing writerThere are now 30 rural health systems participating in six ACOs across nine U.S. states.\nThe National Rural Accountable Care Consortium has announced it has formed five additional ACOs for 2015 for rural healthcare providers.\nThe model services 65,000 attributed Medicare beneficiaries from Texas, California, Washington, Iowa, Indiana, Missouri, Oregon, Illinois, and Michigan, under the care of 1,300 clinicians.\nAmong the Consortium\u2019s comprehensive services are claims data access and analysis, evidence-based medicine leadership, care coordination coaching, and governance, legal, and compliance services."}
