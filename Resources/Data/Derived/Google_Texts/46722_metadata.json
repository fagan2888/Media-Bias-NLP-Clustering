Washington state's health care exchange had to shut down for a few hours.\n\nThere were also a few surprises. Noll, who just turned 30, found out her premium is going up.\n\n\"They were a lot more expensive than what I had before,\" Noll says. \"More than $100, about $125 more.\"\n\nAnd that's per month.\n\nDan Mendelson helped build the site. Now a consultant, he calls this second roll out a period of adjustment.\n\n\"Health insurance companies came to the market last year and made guesses about prices,\" Mendelson says. \"Some priced too high, some priced too low.\"\n\nThe average premium is going up in 24 states, but in at least 11 others, the average premium will be less expensive.\n\nIf you're satisfied with your current plan, you don't have to re-enroll, but Mendelson says shop anyway.\n\n\"It's quite likely that a person will be able to find a less-expensive plan that is comparable in this market,\" Mendelson says.\n\nTori Noll hopes to qualify for some exemptions to lower her cost, but says knowing she has insurance -- just in case -- is worth the cost.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a troubled roll out last year, Healthcare.gov appears to be running relatively smoothly as second enrollment period starts", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/so-far-so-good-for-obamacare-website-healthcare-gov/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/11/16/0407f296-80e6-40d6-9ed9-5d30de8c09f7/thumbnail/1200x630/1e76133c615710e99d3d84395bb950dd/obamacare-website-healthcare-gov.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "After a troubled roll out last year, Healthcare.gov appears to be running relatively smoothly as second enrollment period starts", "title": "So far, so good for Obamacare website Healthcare.gov"}, "twitter": {"description": "After a troubled roll out last year, Healthcare.gov appears to be running relatively smoothly as second enrollment period starts", "title": "So far, so good for Obamacare website Healthcare.gov", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/so-far-so-good-for-obamacare-website-healthcare-gov/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/so-far-so-good-for-obamacare-website-healthcare-gov/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/so-far-so-good-for-obamacare-website-healthcare-gov/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@cbseveningnews", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2014/11/16/0407f296-80e6-40d6-9ed9-5d30de8c09f7/thumbnail/1200x630/1e76133c615710e99d3d84395bb950dd/obamacare-website-healthcare-gov.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/so-far-so-good-for-obamacare-website-healthcare-gov/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/so-far-so-good-for-obamacare-website-healthcare-gov/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSEveningNews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb9bd\"", "article_summary": "After a troubled rollout last year, the Healthcare.gov website appears to be functioning relatively smoothly so far this time around.\nLike millions of other Americans, when New York shoe designer Tori Noll tried to enroll on Healthcare.gov a year ago, she got an error message.\nNEW YORK -- Saturday marked the start of the second enrollment period for people to sign up for federally-mandated health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare.\n\"It's quite likely that a person will be able to find a less-expensive plan that is comparable in this market,\" Mendelson says.\nIf you're satisfied with your current plan, you don't have to re-enroll, but Mendelson says shop anyway."}
