Volunteers counted 13,900 men, women and children during this year\u2019s count on Jan. 28.\n\nA portion of the statewide increase is linked to changes by some New Jersey counties to include residents who get temporary rental assistance as homeless people in emergency shelters, said Katelyn Cunningham, with Monarch Housing Associates, a nonprofit group that directs the homeless count and works to ensure quality affordable housing for everyone.\n\nThat\u2019s not the case in Ocean and Monmouth counties, where the number of people in emergency shelters was down compared to last year.\n\nMonmouth County saw a sharp drop in its overall homeless population, which is at 632 people, compared to last year when the number was at 918. Monmouth County\u2019s homeless population was at 650 people in the count before Sandy and was at 604 in 2010.\n\nThe increase comes largely from the number of people in emergency shelters, while those without shelter and in transitional housing are down over the five-year span.\n\nOcean County\u2019s homeless population was 627 people during this year\u2019s count, down from 682 people last year. The count was 649 people in 2012, the last count before Sandy, and 590 in 2010.\n\nThe number of people who did not have shelter during this year\u2019s count was down once again compared to last year, at 58 people versus 93 in 2013.\n\nMinister Steven Brigham of Lakewood Outreach Ministries said the count may have been down because some Tent City residents already were being housed by Lakewood Township through a deal that would close the encampment.\n\nThe numbers also can be skewed by the services offered in a county. The homeless count, for example, shows a much higher portion of Monmouth County\u2019s homeless are children and families than in Ocean County.\n\nCunningham attributed that to Monmouth County having emergency shelters for families, while homeless families in Ocean County would be placed in hotels or motels.\n\nBrigham said the push to build bigger houses on larger property makes housing unaffordable.\n\n\u201cYou need about three minimum wage jobs to afford the basic necessities. It has created an economic environment where the housing has to be too big, with too much room,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of things they are doing that creates housing that is too expensive for the poor.\u201d\n\nBy the numbers\n\n13,900 men, women and children counted in statewide homeless census\n\n632 homeless people counted in Monmouth County\n\n627 homeless people counted in Ocean County\n\n58 people without shelter\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.app.com/story/news/local/how-we-live/at-risk/2014/06/09/shore-homeless-numbers/10262107/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Shore homeless numbers down", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Shore homeless numbers down", "title": "Shore homeless down from last year, up from 5 years ago", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/how-we-live/at-risk/2014/06/09/shore-homeless-numbers/10262107/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Shore homeless numbers down", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a3dd6cf589426f3fd1b97af307c75b4fca539291/c=525-0-1875-1350&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/06/09/-asbbrd06-01-2014pressmon1a01920140531imgtentcity0530q.jpg11ab7.jpg", "title": "Shore homeless numbers down", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9e4a\"", "article_summary": "The homeless count, for example, shows a much higher portion of Monmouth County\u2019s homeless are children and families than in Ocean County.\nBut homelessness numbers are up at the Shore compared to what they were five years ago, according to data released Monday from NJ Counts 2014, a statewide point-in-time count of the homeless.\nStatewide, the homeless population is up 1,898 people, nearly 16 percent, compared to the 2013 census.\nMonmouth County\u2019s homeless population was at 650 people in the count before Sandy and was at 604 in 2010.\nOcean County\u2019s homeless population was 627 people during this year\u2019s count, down from 682 people last year."}
