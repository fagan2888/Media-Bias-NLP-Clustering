He's given us 74 straight months of private-sector job growth... 20 million Americans covered under the Affordable Care Act... 50 states where marriage equality is the law of the land... and a whole lot more. He inherited a mess from the last president, and he turned it around. It's pretty remarkable.\n\nAt the same time, a lot of Americans are still frustrated, and I understand why. Nearly nine million Americans lost their jobs in the Great Recession. Almost five million homes have been lost to foreclosure. $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. A lot of people haven't recovered from that.\n\nMeanwhile, workers haven't had a raise in 15 years! And good-paying jobs are still too hard to find. It's leaving a lot of people wondering if they'll be able to give their kids the opportunities they deserve.\n\nIn other words, our work isn't done yet.\n\nThat's why I think it's so important to build on the progress we've made and keep going--not erase it and start over.\n\nLet's come together to break down the barriers that continue holding people back, and build ladders of opportunity in their place. We've got to create more good jobs with rising incomes that provide dignity and a bright future. And we've got to break down barriers of bigotry and discrimination, which stand against everything America represents.\n\nThese questions originally appeared on Quora - the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights.
