Ryan will host the very Catholic nuns Obama is attempting to force to pay for abortion drugs under the HHS mandate.\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor are asking the nation\u2019s highest court to ensure they do not have to comply with Obamacare\u2019s abortion mandate. The mandate compels religious groups to pay for birth control and drugs that may cause abortions. Without relief, the Little Sisters would face millions of dollars in IRS fines because they cannot comply with the government\u2019s mandate that they give their employees free access to contraception, sterilization, and abortion-inducing drugs.\n\nOver 200 members of Congress filed legal briefs today supporting the Little Sisters of the Poor in their case against the Obama administration, which is attempting to force them to obey the HS mandate, which requires religious groups to pay for abortion-causing drugs and contraception against their religious views.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan is supporting them as well \u2014 giving their case media attention by inviting them to attend the State of the Union with him.\n\n\u201cThe Little Sisters of the Poor care for the most vulnerable among us, and they should be free to practice their faith without the threat of government interference or intimidation,\u201d Speaker Ryan said. \u201cThe Sisters\u2019 stand in defense of religious liberty \u2013 one of our most fundamental rights \u2013 is nothing short of courageous, and it\u2019s my privilege to support their cause.\u201d\n\nKeep up with the latest pro-life news and information on Twitter. Follow @LifeNewsHQ\n\nSister Loraine Marie Maguire, the organization\u2019s Mother Provincial, and Sister Constance Veit will represent the Little Sisters of the Poor in the Speaker\u2019s box.\n\n\u201cAll we ask is that our rights not be taken away,\u201d Sister Loraine said in a recent release. \u201cThe government exempts large corporations, small businesses, and other religious ministries from what they are imposing on us \u2013 we just want to keep serving the elderly poor as we have always done for 175 years.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor us, this has nothing to do with politics,\u201d Sister Constance said in an interview. \u201cWe just want to take care of the elderly poor without being forced to violate the faith that animates our work.\u201d\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor are an order of Catholic nuns who have been serving the elderly poor since their founding over 175 years ago. The Sisters have asked the Supreme Court for protection from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s HHS mandate through which the government is forcing them to change their healthcare plans to offer drugs that violate their religious beliefs and threatening them with $70 million in fines per year. The Court will likely hear their case in March. Pope Francis highlighted the organization\u2019s work with a surprise visit to their residence in Washington last September.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At SOTU, Speaker Paul Ryan Will Host Catholic Nuns Obama's Forcing to Obey the HHS Mandate", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Pro-life Speaker Paul Ryan is trolling pro-abortion President Barack Obama at Obama's State of the Union address tomorrow.
