Getty Images\n\nBack in 2003, a group of alleged victims of the 9/11 attacks sued the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, claiming it provided significant support to al-Qaeda in advance of the terrorist acts.\n\nA full decade later, thanks to a ruling Thursday by the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals, plaintiffs have won the right to pursue the suit.\n\nIf you\u2019re not already familiar with the lawsuit, there\u2019s no use reading the opinion, which is about as complicated a 16-page ruling we\u2019ve ever read. (Really, masochists, go ahead and try.)\n\nEssentially, the court said that restoring Saudi Arabia as a defendant was necessary to be consistent with a ruling by a different 2nd Circuit panel that allowed another lawsuit to go forward. In that suit, a man sued Afghanistan, among others, for the death of his wife on 9/11.\n\nAccording to the AP:\n\nThe 2nd Circuit and a lower court had previously ruled that Saudi Arabia was protected by sovereign immunity. . . . But in its latest ruling, the 2nd Circuit said a legal exception existed that would allow Saudi Arabia to remain as a defendant, just as Afghanistan remained in the similar case. \u201cThe procedural history of this case produced inconsistent results between two sets of plaintiffs suing for damages based on the same incident,\u201d the appeals court said in a decision written by Circuit Judge Chester J. Straub. \u201cWe conclude that the circumstances here are \u2018extraordinary\u2019 and warrant relief.\u201d\n\nAn attorney representing Saudi Arabia, Kellogg Huber\u2019s Michael Kellogg, told the AP that the panel\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to settled law\u201d and will only result in a lower court throwing the case out for other reasons.\n\nA lawyer for the plaintiffs, Stephen Cozen of Cozen O\u2019Connor, told the LB that the panel\u2019s ruling was \u201ceminently correct\u201d and should \u201cgive these victims the day in court they\u2019ve been waiting for.\u201d\n\nLawyers in the Sept. 11 lawsuits have frequently cited the report by the Sept. 11 Commission, as support for their argument that Saudi Arabia had long been considered the primary source of al Qaeda funding. Lawyers for Saudi Arabia, however, have argued that the commission found no evidence that either the Saudi government or Saudi officials individually funded al Qaeda.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Back in 2003, a group of alleged victims of the 9/11 attacks sued the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, claiming it provided significant support to al-Qaeda in advance of the terrorist acts.
