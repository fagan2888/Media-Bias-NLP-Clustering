(looking at) where they can get better netbacks,\" said Chris Midgley, head of oil markets analysis at Shell Trading.\n\nSTAYING COMPETITIVE ON HEAVY CRUDE\n\nThe move comes a month after Iran discounted its heavy crude against Saudi Arabia to the lowest since 2008 in a battle among producers for market share.\n\nAnd Iran is expected to maintain prices for the bulk of its production to keep its heavy grades competitive against similar crudes from Saudi Arabia and Iraq.\n\nThe April OSP for Iranian Heavy could be set at $2.60 a barrel below Oman/Dubai quotes, unchanged from March, the source with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nForozan is also expected to remain unchanged in April at $2.43 a barrel below Oman/Dubai quotes, the source said. For Souroush crude, Iran will either keep it unchanged or cut the price by a smaller extent than Saudi's Arab Heavy.\n\nSaudi Arabia cut the April OSP for Arab Heavy by 25 cents on Wednesday.\n\nIran will announce its OSPs to customers early next week.\n\n(Reporting by Nidhi Verma in New Delhi; Additional reporting Chen Aizhu in Beijing and Florence Tan in Singapore; Editing by Tom Hogue)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - OPEC's third-largest producer Iran is expected to raise the Apri", "title": "Iran set to raise April light crude prices to Asia on strong demand", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/04/Iran-set-raise-April-light-crude-prices-Asia-strong-demand", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-oil_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/04/Iran-set-raise-April-light-crude-prices-Asia-strong-demand", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/iran-oil_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - OPEC's third-largest producer Iran is expected to raise the Apri", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The rising European demand and a bigger proportion of heavy versus light crude production in Iran may also be limiting the supply of some grades to Asia.\nFor Souroush crude, Iran will either keep it unchanged or cut the price by a smaller extent than Saudi's Arab Heavy.\nSTAYING COMPETITIVE ON HEAVY CRUDEThe move comes a month after Iran discounted its heavy crude against Saudi Arabia to the lowest since 2008 in a battle among producers for market share.\nThis places the official selling price (OSP) for Iranian Light at 25 cents a barrel above Saudi's Arab Light, the highest premium since 2011, trade data showed.\nAnd Iran is expected to maintain prices for the bulk of its production to keep its heavy grades competitive against similar crudes from Saudi Arabia and Iraq."}
