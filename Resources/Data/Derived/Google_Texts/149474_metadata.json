And nobody is more frightened than America\u2019s biggest retailers.\n\nFive years after the 2001 recession ended, real retail spending per person had climbed 7 percent above its prerecession level. More than five years after the end of the Great Recession\u2014August 2014\u2014retail spending per person had finally reached its prerecession level.\n\nFormer Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon, whose company had seen consumer traffic drop for six straight quarters and same-store sales drop for five quarters, explained in July 2014 that \u201cwe\u2019ve reached a point where it\u2019s not getting any better but it\u2019s not getting any worse\u2014at least for the middle (class) and down.\u201d Kip Tindell, CEO of the Container Store, put retailers\u2019 feelings best when he said, \u201cconsistent with so many of our fellow retailers, we are experiencing a retail \u2018funk.'\u201d\n\nThe culprit is obvious: low wage and income growth for the middle class. Median household income in 2013 stood 8 percentage points below its 2007 prerecession level. The simple fact of the matter is that when households do not have money, retailers do not have customers. The failure of incomes to keep up with the growing cost of college, child care, and other middle-class staples leaves even less money for retail spending. A previous analysis by the Center for American Progress shows that this so-called \u201cmiddle-class squeeze\u201d\u2014stagnant incomes and the growing cost of middle-class security\u2014leaves the median married couple with two kids with $5,500 less to spend annually on food, clothes, and other essentials that retailers sell.\n\nOr, as officials of J.C. Penney\u2014whose sales fell 9 percent in 2013\u2014put it when listing the risks to its stock value: \u201cthe moderate income consumer, which is our core customer, has been under economic pressure for the past several years.\u201d Moreover, retail spending\u2014which includes spending on everything from clothing to groceries to dining out\u2014has broad implications for the entire economy since it accounts for a large fraction of consumer spending, which itself makes up 70 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, or GDP.\n\nThis report gathers new evidence to show that middle-class weakness and stagnant wage growth are holding the economy back. We use the financial statements, known as 10-Ks\u2014the annual report required by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC\u2014of the top 100 retailers in America and words of some of Wall Street\u2019s top economists to underscore the point.\n\nTime and again, America\u2019s leading corporations warn investors that \u201cdecreased levels of consumer spending\u201d (Kohl\u2019s), \u201ca renewed decline in consumer-spending levels\u201d (Sears), and \u201cdecreased salaries and wages\u201d (Burger King) could have a huge negative impact on their financial performance. The corporate consensus is clear: It is this cycle of stagnation\u2014low wages, leading to weak demand, leading to slow growth, leading back to low wages\u2014that is hurting companies, their consumers, and the U.S. economy at large.\n\nThis report finds that:\n\nEighty-eight percent of the top 100 U.S. retailers cite weak consumer spending as a risk factor to their stock price.\n\nSixty-eight percent of the top 100 U.S. retailers cite falling or flat incomes as risks. Looking just at companies that were publicly held in 2006, the percent listing consumers\u2019 incomes as a risk factor has doubled since that year. A majority of retailers\u201457 percent\u2014cite rising energy, health care, housing, and other essential costs as risks, showing the middle-class squeeze of rising costs and stagnant incomes.\n\nWall Street economists are even more explicit about the risk that low wages pose to the economy, arguing that they drive low demand and high unemployment.\n\nRetailers could improve their profits by embracing a middle-class-growth-oriented agenda instead of spending their political energy on preventing policies that increase wages. Policies such as a minimum-wage increase could provide the perfect mechanism for coordinating wage growth that could benefit the entire retail sector by fueling more consumer spending.\n\nThe evidence assembled in this report directly repudiates \u201ctrickle-down economics\u201d\u2014the idea that the only way to produce economic growth is to redistribute money to the rich, who will create jobs for everyone else. Conservative politicians, lobbyists, and commentators may still be stuck in the trickle-down mindset of the 1980s, but corporate America and the Wall Street analysts who closely follow it know better.\n\nWhile it may at first seem obvious that low consumer demand impedes growth, conservative think tanks and other believers in trickle-down economics ignore the evidence. Stephen Moore, chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, approvingly quotes Arthur Laffer, the father of trickle-down economics, who said, \u201cAll economic problems are about removing impediments to supply, not demand.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s \u201cJobs, Growth, and Opportunity Agenda\u201d report similarly focuses on \u201cexpanding trade, producing more domestic energy, improving infrastructure, modernizing the regulatory process, making essential changes to entitlements, fixing the flaws in Obamacare, curbing lawsuit abuse, and advancing American innovation by protecting intellectual property\u2026revitalizing capital markets, passing immigration reform, and improving education and training, which will expand opportunity, address inequality, and create jobs.\u201d At the same time, it opposes any measures \u201cthat would automatically increase labor costs.\u201d There is literally no policy in the agenda focused on immediately increasing aggregate demand and consumer spending other than perhaps the jobs created by infrastructure improvements and higher wages produced by immigration reform.\n\nIf the Heritage Foundation, the U.S. Chamber, and other proponents of trickle-down economics refuse to believe the overwhelming academic evidence that clearly shows low consumer spending and income growth are holding the economy back, they should listen to corporate America and Wall Street when they say that a consumer base with large, growing discretionary incomes\u2014in other words, a strong middle class\u2014is the vital ingredient for job growth and a strong economy. Or, as Ellen Zentner, executive director and senior economist at Morgan Stanley, explained, \u201cfaster employment and wage growth for those at the bottom, were it to have staying power, would help lift consumer spending, the biggest part of the economy.\u201d\n\nBrendan V.
