Rick Santorum (R-PA). \u201cI think it\u2019s really the sleeper issue going into 2016 in Iowa.\u201d\n\nBrabender added that the issue of Common Core was among the first questions asked at every town hall meeting Santorum has held recently in Iowa.\n\nFormer Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, however, has championed the Common Core standards for several years, and remains committed to them, though his support for them has been considered a major hurdle for him with the conservative base of the Republican Party.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported last August, a Phi Delta Kappa/Gallup (PDK/Gallup) poll found that only 19 percent of Americans knew \u201cnothing at all\u201d about the Common Core standards and that 60 percent opposed teachers using the standards to guide what they teach.\n\nThe survey of more than 1,000 Americans 18 years and older found that Republicans appear to be most educated about the Common Core standards, with 54 percent stating they knew either \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca fair amount\u201d about the initiative, compared to 40 percent of Democrats and 46 percent of independents.\n\nOf those identifying as Republicans, 76 percent said they opposed teachers\u2019 use of the Common Core standards, compared to 38 percent of Democrats and 60 percent of independents.\n\nBush, however, has spoken about the Common Core standards as both more \u201crigorous\u201d and \u201chigher\u201d than other standards and, as the Boston Globe recently observed, as the new \u201cminimum\u201d in classrooms.\n\nNo independent studies have been conducted to support the claim that the Common Core standards are more \u201crigorous\u201d or \u201chigher\u201d than other standards.\n\nAccording to CBS News, Justin LaVan, a lawyer and president of the Network of Iowa Christian Home Educators, said Bush\u2019s stance on Common Core will be a \u201cbig issue\u201d for him among Iowa participants in the state\u2019s caucus. A candidate\u2019s support for common core raises red flags \u201cabout who they are and what they believe about education and states\u2019 rights,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother potential GOP 2016 candidate \u2013 former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee \u2013 has his problems with the Common Core standards as well. The former Fox News Channel host supported the Common Core for years, and said conservative criticism of the standards was \u201cdisturbing.\u201d Huckabee told the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), one of the creators and owners of the Common Core standards, that they should simply get rid of the \u201cCommon Core\u201d name because it had become \u201ctoxic.\u201d\n\n\u201cRebrand it, refocus it, but don\u2019t retreat,\u201d Huckabee said.\n\nAs CBS News indicates, however, Huckabee said last month at the Iowa Freedom Summit, \u201cAnybody who tells you I support Common Core is incredibly less informed than he or she pretends to be or is just being plain dishonest because they really want to help somebody else.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I can tell you as a strategist is\u2026anybody who says that they\u2019ve supported Common Core in the past is going to have a difficult time explaining to GOP primary voters why they ever supported it,\u201d Brabender said.\n\n\u201cCommon Core is big everywhere,\u201d he added. \u201cYou would be hard pressed to find a state where it\u2019s not a critical issue\u2026and it is every bit as potent an issue as Obamacare or immigration or any other issue. It\u2019s also probably one of the few issues where there are legitimate differences between the candidates.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "CBS News: Common Core \u2018Poised to Play a Big Role\u2019 in GOP Primary", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "CBS News: Common Core \u2018Poised to Play a Big Role\u2019 in GOP Primary", "title": "CBS News: Common Core \u2018Poised to Play a Big Role\u2019 in GOP Primary - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/jeb-bush-hands-ap.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-journalism/2015/02/22/cbs-news-common-core-poised-to-play-a-big-role-in-gop-primary/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CBS News: Common Core \u2018Poised to Play a Big Role\u2019 in GOP Primary", "title": "CBS News: Common Core \u2018Poised to Play a Big Role\u2019 in GOP Primary - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/jeb-bush-hands-ap.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "CBS News, Common Core, Common Core rebrand, GOP primary, Iowa caucus, Jeb Bush 2016, John Brabender, Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum,2016 Presidential Race, Big Journalism, Education,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Rick Santorum", "published_time": "2015-02-22T08:43:38-07:00", "categories": "Big Journalism,2016 Presidential Race,Education"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe050a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cCommon Core is big everywhere,\u201d he added.\nNo independent studies have been conducted to support the claim that the Common Core standards are more \u201crigorous\u201d or \u201chigher\u201d than other standards.\nOf those identifying as Republicans, 76 percent said they opposed teachers\u2019 use of the Common Core standards, compared to 38 percent of Democrats and 60 percent of independents.\nMike Huckabee \u2013 has his problems with the Common Core standards as well.\nBush, however, has spoken about the Common Core standards as both more \u201crigorous\u201d and \u201chigher\u201d than other standards and, as the Boston Globe recently observed, as the new \u201cminimum\u201d in classrooms."}
