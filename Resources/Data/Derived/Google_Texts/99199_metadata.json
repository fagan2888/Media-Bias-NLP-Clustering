Have immigration-reform advocates such as Mark Zuckerberg or Michael Bloomberg offered one of their mansions as a temporary shelter for needy Central American immigrants? Couldn\u2019t Yale or Stanford welcome homeless immigrants into their now under-occupied summertime dorms? Why aren\u2019t elite academies such as Sidwell Friends or the Menlo School offering their gymnasia as places of refuge for tens of thousands of school-age Central Americans?\n\nShare this meme on Facebook, Twitter or elsewhere if you agree.\n\nHanson concluded,\n\nWhat a strange, selfish, and callous alliance of rich corporate grandees, cynical left-wing politicians, and ethnic chauvinists who have conspired to erode U.S. law for their own narrow interests, all the while smearing those who object as xenophobes, racists, and nativists. How did such immoral special interests hijack U.S. immigration law and arbitrarily decide for 300 million Americans who earns entry into America, under what conditions, and from where?\"\n\nThere's a lot more in Hanson's piece, which is worth reading.\n\nIn the meantime, last I heard, the Facebook campus still had 11 restaurants capable of feeding kids and plenty of yard room for pitching tents, and the AFL-CIO has an apparently empty campus in Silver Spring, MD with dorms, dining facilities, a 72,000 square foot conference center and nearly 47 acres of additional space for tents.\n\nI wonder how many cots could fit in a 72,000 square foot conference center...", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/resource/AFLCIOLaborCollegeFacilityMeme070514.jpg?fileId=25183091", "description": "Share this meme on Facebook, Twitter or elsewhere if you agree. \n\n Victor Davis Hanson is hitting ...", "title": "Crisis on the Border: Where are Zuckerberg, Trumka and Bloomberg\u00a0Now? - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb9d0\"", "article_summary": "I spoke of Big Business, specifically, Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook, and Big Labor, specifically, the AFL-CIO.\nHave immigration-reform advocates such as Mark Zuckerberg or Michael Bloomberg offered one of their mansions as a temporary shelter for needy Central American immigrants?\nShare this meme on Facebook, Twitter or elsewhere if you agree.\nVictor Davis Hanson is hitting some of the same points I made last weekend, specifically, the moral obligation of wealthy amnesty-advocates to help the kids who are crossing our southern border.\nI wonder how many cots could fit in a 72,000 square foot conference center..."}
