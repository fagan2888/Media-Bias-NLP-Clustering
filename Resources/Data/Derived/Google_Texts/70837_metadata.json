An ongoing investigation has closed down the busy bar until further notice.\n\nA mumps outbreak among over 20 people is reportedly connected to a bar in New Jersey. An ongoing investigation has closed down the busy bar until further notice. David Gard/For The Star-Ledger\n\nAn investigation into a mumps outbreak has shut down a bar on the Jersey Shore. After visiting D\u2019Jais Bar and Grill in Belmar, N.J., 21 people have reported mumps-like symptoms, which prompted health officials to release a statement on Thursday.\n\nMumps is a viral infection that was common in the United States until vaccination became routine. It primarily affects the parotid glands, one of the three saliva-producing glands that sit just below and in front of your ears. The vaccination was first licensed in the U.S. in 1967. By 2005, childhood vaccination coverage reduced the disease rate by 99 percent. Before the two-dose routine vaccination program was introduced, mumps was a common illness in infants, children, and young adults.\n\nThe recent outbreak was first reported on Wednesday, prompting Monmouth County Health Department to step in and investigate.\n\n\u201cThe medical professional advised these individuals to be on bed rest, increase their fluid intake and take steps to reduce their fever,\u201d Michael Meddis, the country\u2019s public health coordinator, said in a statement.\n\nMumps is highly contagious and often starts showing symptoms within a few days, including fever, headaches, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swelling of the salivary glands, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It is spread through tiny droplets of saliva or mucus and is usually contracted when an infected person cough, sneezes, talks, or shares a drink with another person. Touching a contaminated surface that was touched by someone with mumps and then rubbing the mouth or nose can also transmit the condition.\n\nThe CDC has provided a preventative measures list for the public to follow, especially during an outbreak:\n\nMinimize contact with others, especially babies and those with weakened immune systems. If glands around the ears begin to swell, stay home from work or school for at least five days and avoid contact with other members of the household. Use a tissue to cover mouth and nose if you have to cough or sneeze and then properly dispose of it afterwards. Never sneeze or cough into your hands, but use upper sleeve if necessary. Practice proper hygiene and wash hands with soap and warm water. Never share drinks or utensils. Clean surfaces with soap and water or cleaning wipes routinely.\n\nAccording to D\u2019Jais's co-owner, Frank Sementa, some of this employees started to feel sick over the weekend. \u201cThe employees went to the doctors and then all of a sudden it became, well gee, they\u2019re saying we may have the mumps,\u201d Sementa told Fox News.\n\n\u201cThis matter is being handled with great concern and sensitivity by the owners of D\u2019Jais, the Borough and the County of Monmouth,\u201d Belmar Administrator Colleen Connolly said in a statement. \u201cD\u2019Jais and the County of Monmouth are working together on ensuring that workers and patrons are safe and will follow all necessary protocols to ensure the matter is handled responsibly. Nothing is more important that the health and well being of our residents.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "mumps, infection, outbreak, new jersey bar, vaccination", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A mumps outbreak among over 20 people is reportedly connected to a bar in New Jersey.
