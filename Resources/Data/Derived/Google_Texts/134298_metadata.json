The effort allowed residents to drive out after floodwaters busted U.S. Highway 36 on both ends of town.\n\nThumbing through the book, readers get more images of this otherwise hidden place through excerpts from the personal journal Pinewood Springs Fire Protection District Capt. Josh Thompson kept and titled, \"Tropical Storm Pinewood.\"\n\nResident Melody Brinkley walks out of the Pinewood Springs fire station on Oct. 16.

Only rubble remained,\" he wrote 11 days into the ordeal, when he and remaining residents evacuated on the Old Stagecoach Road. \"Surreal glimpses of a piano in a tree, a phone pole wearing a floral dress, and several mangled cars greeted us as we made our way back into the world.\"\n\nA chili supper season\n\nSo far, the Pinewood Springs Fire Protection District has raised about $230,000 toward the estimated $750,000 cost of a new fire station by conducting the usual fundraisers and saving annual budget surpluses, Andrew Lucas, the assistant fire chief, said.\n\nNot a cent comes in too soon, though \u2014 from book proceeds to chili suppers \u2014 given the current station's limitations.\n\nIts leaky roof, rotting structure, unheated office, and cramped quarters made it a poor ground zero for both command operations and community services, he said.\n\nDuring the flood, residents received medical care and ate meals in the same small conference room \u2014 often at the same time. They walked in and out of the office/hallway to the conference room, which disrupted first responder communication and planning.\n\nLucas and Thompson eventually moved their command center from the office to one of the fire truck bays \u2014 bays no longer big enough to house modern rigs and emergency gear \u2014 to avoid compromising privacy as they managed the crisis.\n\n\"It's not that we were hiding anything,\" Lucas said. \"It's just that you want to present factual things in the right way at the right time so people don't panic.\"\n\nThe inside story\n\nA mill levy to fund a new Fire Station and Community Center made the town's municipal ballot this fall.\n\nIf you go What: Author signing, \"The Road Home: The 2013 Flood \u2014 Pinewood Springs Rises Above the Water\" When: 1 to 2 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 31 Where: Barbed Wire Books, 504 Main St., Longmont For more information or to donate to the new Pinewood Springs Fire Station and Community Center: Visit http://www.coloradofloodbook.org/fire-station-community-center/\n\nMeanwhile, the book project keeps raising funds and reminding contributors of the worst of times and the best of times \u2014 times when residents suffered displacement and in the midst of that documented nature's stunning ferocity and their community's brave response to it.\n\nIt forced them to pause.\n\n\"The network went out. And the bridges went out. So, when the sun went down, there was not much to do,\" John Bologna, who photographed and videotaped the Little Thompson River washing out the Kiowa Bridge, said.\n\nIn the eddy of their routine lives, some residents found unexpected peace and quiet.\n\nDan Cundall, Kathleen Cundall's husband and a Redneck Road Crew member, stayed in town to help mop up and snap photos even after all six dams in Big Elk Meadow gave way and caused 2-foot surges \u2014 walls of water that temporarily halted the stream of the 2.3 million vehicles that head in and out of Pinewood Springs annually.\n\n\"Building the Stagecoach Road, we would stop and take a break, and the silence would almost break your ears,\" he said. \"The turkeys and the foxes came out. The animals came out and were like, 'What are you guys still doing here?'\"\n\nThe road home\n\nInasmuch as the book focuses on why nearly everyone needed to leave Pinewood Springs, post flood, it also illustrates why nearly everyone returned \u2014 how renewal can happen both in nature and in communities after devastation.\n\n\"There were 80 trees dumped in my backyard afterward, and I knew the one at the bottom of them was mine because there was a part of my hammock still attached to it,\" resident and flood shutterbug, Donn Fairbank, said.\n\nInstead of wasting what the flood brought, he bought a portable saw mill to make boards, beams and furniture out of the timber with all proceeds going to the fire protection district's building fund.\n\nFellow amateur photographer and resident Hults still remembers the overpowering sap smell caused by so many Ponderosa pines broken like toothpicks under the crush of water and debris.\n\nHe got close enough.\n\n\"There was just this urge to capture it all,\" Hults said. \"It was a moment that we had never seen before and will never see again.\"\n\nPam Mellskog can be reached at p.mellskog@gmail.com or 303-746-0942.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-features/ci_29015220/pinewood-springs-residents-share-photos-2013-flood-raise", "modificationDate": "2015-10-25T12:50:03-0600", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1023/20151023__25TCCLIF~4_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Pam Mellskog  For the Times-Call", "description": "Instead of cringing underneath dripping eaves and umbrellas during the 2013 flood, a band of Pinewood Springs residents protected their cameras with plastic grocery bags and headed into the driving rain that made their town a ghost town over one weekend.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:29015220:view"}, "startDate": "2015-10-24T22:38:45-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-features/ci_29015220/pinewood-springs-residents-share-photos-2013-flood-raise", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1023/20151023__25TCCLIF~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Instead of cringing underneath dripping eaves and umbrellas during the 2013 flood, a band of Pinewood Springs residents protected their cameras with plastic grocery bags and headed into the driving rain that made their town a ghost town over one weekend.", "title": "Pinewood Springs residents share photos of 2013 flood to raise funds for new firehouse, rebuild community"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Instead of cringing underneath dripping eaves and umbrellas during the 2013 flood, a band of Pinewood Springs residents protected their cameras with plastic grocery bags and headed into the driving rain that made their town a ghost town over one weekend.", "title": "Pinewood Springs residents share photos of 2013 flood to raise funds for new firehouse, rebuild community", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/community-features/ci_29015220/pinewood-springs-residents-share-photos-2013-flood-raise", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1023/20151023__25TCCLIF~1.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-10-24T22:38:45-0600", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-10-23T17:37:03-0600", "sailthru.title": "Pinewood Springs residents share photos of 2013 flood to raise funds for new firehouse, rebuild community", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Community Features", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Pam Mellskog", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/1023/20151023__25TCCLIF~4.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-10-24T22:48:15-0600"}, "article_summary": "Pinewood Springs residents John Bologna and Kathleen Cundall study photos in \"The Road Home: the 2013 flood \u2014 Pinewood Springs Rises Above the Water\" in front of the Kiowa Bridge in Pinewood Springs on Oct. 16.\nDuring the flood, residents received medical care and ate meals in the same small conference room \u2014 often at the same time.\nCundall, a 37-year Pinewood Springs resident, said that invisibility inspired the book project.\nAs more images stacked up in the dropbox, she and two other residents \u2014 Melody Brinkley and Elizabeth Noble \u2014 formed The Pinewood Springs Flood Book Committee to bring a 124-page, coffee table book to press.\nThe cover to the book \"The Road Home: The 2013 Flood-Pinewood Springs Rises Above the Water. \""}
