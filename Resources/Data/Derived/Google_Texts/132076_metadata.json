Reuters/Jason Reed\n\n(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday proposed a ban on electricalstimulation devices (ESDs) that are used to curb individuals from engaging in self-injurious or aggressive behavior, saying they pose an \"unreasonable and substantial\" risk to public health.\n\nESDs administer electrical shocks through electrodes attached to the skin to attempt to condition to stop individuals from harming themselves or being aggressive. (http://1.usa.gov/1VGHKus)\n\nEvidence indicates a number of significant psychological and physical risks are associated with the use of these devices, including depression, anxiety, pain, burns, tissue damage and errant shocks from a device malfunction, the regulator noted.\n\nMoreover, many of those on whom these devices are used have intellectual or developmental disabilities that make it difficult for them to communicate their pain or consent.\n\n\"As these risks cannot be eliminated through new or updated labeling, banning the product is necessary to protect public health,\" the agency said on Friday.\n\nThe Judge Rotenberg Educational Center in Canton, Massachusetts is the only facility currently manufacturing and using these devices in the United States, the FDA said, adding that between 45 and 50 individuals are exposed to it.\n\nState-of-the-art behavioral treatments, such as positive behavioral support and medication can be used rein in this type of behavior, the regulator said.\n\nIf passed, the ban would not apply to ESDs used to create aversions to other conditions or habits, such as smoking, the FDA said.\n\nThe proposal is available for public comment at www.regulations.gov for 30 days.\n\n(Reporting by Natalie Grover in Bengaluru)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "fda, proposes, ban, certain, electrical, stimulation, devices", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The administration said they pose an unreasonable and substantial risk to public health.", "title": "FDA Proposes Ban On Certain Electrical Stimulation Devices", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/food-and-drug-administration-ban-electrical-stimulation-devices-383245", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/24/fda.JPG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The administration said they pose an unreasonable and substantial risk to public health.", "title": "FDA Proposes Ban On Certain Electrical Stimulation Devices", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/food-and-drug-administration-ban-electrical-stimulation-devices-383245", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/24/fda.JPG", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/04/24/fda.JPG"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2016-04-24T11:56:52-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T11:56:52-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The administration said they pose an unreasonable and substantial risk to public health."}, "article_summary": "A view shows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland August 14, 2012.\nIf passed, the ban would not apply to ESDs used to create aversions to other conditions or habits, such as smoking, the FDA said.\nMoreover, many of those on whom these devices are used have intellectual or developmental disabilities that make it difficult for them to communicate their pain or consent.\nESDs administer electrical shocks through electrodes attached to the skin to attempt to condition to stop individuals from harming themselves or being aggressive.\nState-of-the-art behavioral treatments, such as positive behavioral support and medication can be used rein in this type of behavior, the regulator said."}
