One woman held a sign with a girl\u2019s picture surrounded by the caption: \u201cMarco Rubio: Will You Deport This U.S. Citizen\u2019s Mom?\u201d A group held a banner with a message in Spanish that translates to: \u201cRubio\u2019s dream is our nightmare.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nDespite the interest of the pro-immigration demonstrators, the Republican senator did not address amnesty or border reform in his speech. Nor did Rubio mention his fellow Floridian Jeb Bush, who recently announced his presidential candidacy but did not, notably, speak at the annual Miami-Dade Republican Party event. Instead, Rubio addressed Obamacare, taxes, energy, and human rights around the world\u2014obliquely addressing immigration in a discussion about the American Dream of his parents.\n\n\u201cWe will repeal and replace Obamacare before it repeals and replaces any more American jobs,\u201d Florida\u2019s junior senator told the audience.\n\nHe promised that a Rubio administration would help America \u201clead the world in producing oil and natural gas,\u201d \u201cend the dangerous cuts to our military,\u201d \u201cnot forget those in jail in Tehran, Moscow, Havana, and Caracas,\u201d and \u201cappoint an attorney general and judges who will defend all Americans, including those who hold traditional values.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s message perhaps resonated most when he shifted from public policy to his personal history.\n\n\u201cMy father worked at a portable bar in back of a hotel ballroom like this so I could be in front of the room at a podium like this,\u201d the son of Cuban immigrants told the heavily Latino crowd. He added elsewhere, \u201cI was told it wasn\u2019t my turn to be president. But I was also told it wasn\u2019t my turn to be a senator in 2009.\u201d\n\nIn a recent Quinnipiac poll, Rubio outperformed all other Republican presidential aspirants in a head-to-head with Hillary Clinton save for Rand Paul. The Kentucky senator trailed the former secretary of state 46 percent to 42 percent, Rubio trailed 45 to 41, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Saturday night\u2019s Man Who Was Not There, grabbed 37 percent to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 47 percent.\n\nEver the optimist, about his country and his chances to lead it, Senator Rubio maintained in his speech: \u201cI believe we are one election from the greatest era in American history.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Marco Rubio: 'One Election from the Greatest Era in American History'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Marco Rubio: 'One Election from the Greatest Era in American History'", "title": "Marco Rubio: 'One Election from the Greatest Era in American History' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Anti-Rubio-Protest-Miami-Dade.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-06-20T21:03:41-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/20/marco-rubio-one-election-from-the-greatest-era-in-american-history/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Marco Rubio: 'One Election from the Greatest Era in American History'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Anti-Rubio-Protest-Miami-Dade.jpg", "title": "Marco Rubio: 'One Election from the Greatest Era in American History' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Immigration,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2015-06-20T20:25:23-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-06-20T21:03:41-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Ever the optimist, about his country and his chances to lead it, Senator Rubio maintained in his speech: \u201cI believe we are one election from the greatest era in American history.\u201d\n\u201cWe will repeal and replace Obamacare before it repeals and replaces any more American jobs,\u201d Florida\u2019s junior senator told the audience.\nThe Kentucky senator trailed the former secretary of state 46 percent to 42 percent, Rubio trailed 45 to 41, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Saturday night\u2019s Man Who Was Not There, grabbed 37 percent to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 47 percent.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERMIAMI\u2014Presidential candidate Marco Rubio spoke as the guest of honor at the annual Lincoln Day Dinner in his hometown on Saturday night.\nInstead, Rubio addressed Obamacare, taxes, energy, and human rights around the world\u2014obliquely addressing immigration in a discussion about the American Dream of his parents."}
