Leading the findings in the 2015 study is a mild upswing in projections for profitability among the more than 5,000 physicians surveyed.\n\nThe PPI was conceived as part of a partnership between CareCloud and QuantiaMD, an award-winning web and mobile community for physicians, to serve as a barometer of the current state of physician practices and provide insight into physician outlooks for the year ahead.\n\nOverall Findings\n\nWhile physicians expecting a downward profitability trend in the coming year still outnumber those with positive perspectives\u201431% versus 24%\u2014the positive group grew year over year. What\u2019s more, downward projections no longer dominate; the flat forecast group was the largest in this year\u2019s PPI (35%).\n\nDespite the shift, challenges to physician practice profitability have not subsided. The index shows that physicians continue to grapple with declining reimbursement, rising costs, and regulatory changes. However, they\u2019re actively investing in new ways to shore up practice operations and boost profitability, with technology playing a key role.\n\nRecent Trends Impacting Physician Practice Profitability\n\nKey trends impacting physician practice profitability include:\n\n1. Declining reimbursement remains the top threat to physician profitability.\n\nDeclining reimbursement and rising costs were the top two challenges again this year, but the transition to ICD-10 replaced the Affordable Care Act at number three.\n\n2. ICD-10 Seen as Major Challenge to Profitability\n\nWhile declining reimbursement (62%) and rising costs (55%) remain the top threats to practice profitability, regulatory shifts are close behind. Physicians completed the survey in July and August 2015, with the October 1, 2015 ICD-10 deadline looming on the horizon so, unsurprisingly, ICD-10 took the number three spot (52%) in place of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n3. Fewer Physician Owners Looking to Sell Their Practice, Despite Financial & Admin Pressures Mounting\n\nPhysicians\u2019 ownership plans reflect the mild uptick in profitability sentiments. 59% of physician owners said they were not looking to sell or merge. Last year, when asked about selling, a lower share said they were not looking to do so (53%). However, the pressure has become too much for a substantial share: almost one-quarter are looking to sell/merge or considering it, citing excessive administrative work as the top reason. Administrative tasks continue to burden physicians across the board: more than 60% spend a day a week or more on them.\n\n4. Billing, Staffing, and Technology Are Key Targets for Improvement\n\nLess than half of respondents rated their current staff, technology, and processes as \u201ceffective\u201d or \u201cvery effective\u201d at securing quick and proper payment for patient care. Fittingly, when asked about targets for driving operational improvement in their practices, billing and collections processes, staffing, and technology topped physicians\u2019 lists.\n\n5. EHR \u201cRip and Replace\u201d Trend Continues\n\nThe PPI revealed that the \u201crip and replace\u201d trend around core IT systems is still going strong. Almost 20% of physicians plan to replace their practice management (PM) and/or electronic health records (EHR) systems in the coming year. Why? Current systems don\u2019t integrate with other technologies (39%), are hard/slow to use (37%), and/or are not cost-effective (33%).\n\n6. Lack of EHR Integration, Usability Driving Dissatisfaction and Profits\n\nPhysicians replacing their PM and/or EHR systems are doing so primarily because their current systems do not integrate with other technologies (39%), are hard to use/slow them down (37%), and/or are not cost-effective (33%). While lack of integration was a new option in this year\u2019s survey, usability and costeffectiveness were key drivers in 2014 as well. Physicians appear to be growing increasingly frustrated with hard to use solutions, as that figure jumped six points from 31% in 2014 to 37% in 2015.\n\nFor more information, access the full 2015 PPI report here", "article_metadata": {"description": "While physicians expecting a downward profitability trend in the coming year, challenges to physician practice profitability have not subsided.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"description": "While physicians expecting a downward profitability trend in the coming year, challenges to physician practice profitability have not subsided.", "title": "CareCloud: 6 Recent Trends Impacting Physician Practice Profitability", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1075, "identifier": "http://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Physician-Practice-Profitability.png", "height": 325}, "updated_time": "2015-11-17T16:53:09-04:00", "url": "http://hitconsultant.net/2015/11/17/6-recent-trends-impacting-physician-practice-profitability/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "While physicians expecting a downward profitability trend in the coming year, challenges to physician practice profitability have not subsided.", "creator": "@hitconsultant", "image": "http://wrm5sysfkg-flywheel.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Physician-Practice-Profitability.png", "title": "CareCloud: 6 Recent Trends Impacting Physician Practice Profitability", "site": "@hitconsultant", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "google-site-verification": "ZfA9TYzJhTo4Qq5hZKk2GVBYHj0-7Bu73PO0P5jbDaI", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/HIT-Consultant-Media/302199219847409", "section": "Health IT", "tag": "Physician Practice Profitability", "published_time": "2015-11-17T17:00:49-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-17T16:53:09-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Recent Trends Impacting Physician Practice ProfitabilityKey trends impacting physician practice profitability include:1.\nDespite the shift, challenges to physician practice profitability have not subsided.\nFewer Physician Owners Looking to Sell Their Practice, Despite Financial & Admin Pressures MountingPhysicians\u2019 ownership plans reflect the mild uptick in profitability sentiments.\nDeclining reimbursement remains the top threat to physician profitability.\nHowever, they\u2019re actively investing in new ways to shore up practice operations and boost profitability, with technology playing a key role."}
