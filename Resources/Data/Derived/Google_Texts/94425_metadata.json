More specifically in Pacific Beach. Okay, in Crown Point, if you must know. Happy now? He was once known as a \"somewhat popular blogger\" back when blogs were a 'thing'. He is writing the Great American Novel, minus the 'great' part.\n\nReach for the moon, you guys (Shutterstock)\n\nIn what can only be described as a gesture so monumentally unselfish and magnanimous it makes Jesus Christ look like Ayn Rand, conservative writers from across this great land of ours are setting aside their differences with liberals to offer up some loving advice completely divorced of any ulterior motives.\n\nAddressing Democrats (or as they like to call them: \u201cMuslim-humping \u2018Murica-hating commiefaghomo baby killers,\u201d or \u201clibtards\u201d if they\u2019re into that whole brevity thing, or \u2018Morans\u201d if they are in the Tea Party) conservative writers are super concerned that liberals are way too starry-eyed over Hillary Clinton\u2019s electoral prospects in 2016 when there are so many other fish in the sea.\n\nDespite the seven year courtship that began with her first presidential run \u2014 to say nothing the eight years that she was in the White house as First Lady \u2014 what do we really know about Hillary? I mean, really? Who is this woman?\n\nTheir concern stems from Hillary\u2019s recent email problems \u2014 the Katrina or 9/11 of VPN\u2019s \u2014 and don\u2019t people understand that this is a big honking deal if you\u2019re a pundit tasked daily with providing \u201ccontent\u201d during a political season chock full of policy disputes. I mean, who wants to write and read that crap, right?\n\nSo, despite the fact that the public is 83 percent \u201cmeh, whatevs, we\u2019ve seen this witch hunt before, what else you got?\u201d about the latest ephemeral \u201cscandal,\u201d the always-forward-looking conservative writers are charting a future back-up plan for Democrats because they care. Truly. Madly. Deeply.\n\nOver at \u2018whatever it is, I\u2019m against it\u2019 Slate, Ross Douthat\u2019s old writing partner, Reihan Salam, is just as concerned about Democrats marrying Hillary in haste as Ross is that women don\u2019t get married at all before acting like common succubi and whores.\n\nOne nevertheless wonders whether the latest Clinton miniscandal will lead at least some Democrats to think, Hey, why not run for president? What exactly do I have to lose? If nothing else, a 2016 presidential campaign would lay the groundwork for a future run, when there will be no Clintons blocking the way.\n\nSalam gives lip service to the three most often mentioned opponents \u2013 Bernie Sanders, Martin O\u2019Malley, and Elizabeth Warren who has stated emphatically that she is not running, yet if she were to somehow to go live on Mars, Politico wouldn\u2019t miss a beat, running \u201cCan Elizabeth Warren run for President from Mars\u201d think pieces \u2014 before moving on to several alternatives.\n\nThere is former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick \u2014 along with three Democrats who, if you are average-Joe-voter who only tunes into the presidential election on election day to vote like it\u2019s the American Idol finale, they are as unknown to the masses as the name of the guy who played bass in Van Halen. Yeah, that guy, The chubby one with the beard. Him. Chubby bearded bass-guy.\n\nFor the record, they (not including the Van Halen guy) are Sherrod Brown, Ron Wyden, and Amy Klobuchar \u2014 all of them wonderful intelligent liberal people who are not particularly known for lighting up a room with starbursts.\n\nAnd, let\u2019s be serious: both parties have their respective 40 percent locked up \u2014 all that is left is flashy marketing to the squishy middle that wants to wooed and dazzled and flattered.\n\nOh, wait. Salam also suggests\u2026.wait for it\u2026. tiny autocrat Michael Bloomberg.\n\nWhat can I say? It\u2019s Slate and Michael Bloomberg as the 2016 Democratic nominee is the Slate-iest Slate pitch in the history of Slate. Or at least since \u2018Creed is Good.\u2019\n\nOver at National Review, David Harsanyi is bewitched, bothered and bewildered that Democrats aren\u2019t looking past the end of their polls that show Hillary is the odds-on favorite in 2016.\n\nMany Democrats probably feel as if there\u2019s no other viable choice. But despite the generous treatment she\u2019s received from the media\u2026\n\nHAHAHAHAHA \u2014 I\u2019m sorry. Please proceed:\n\nHillary may well win the presidency for a number of reasons that have nothing to do with her charisma or acumen. But the next four to eight years would be about the drama surrounding Hillary. She\u2019s not even officially running yet, and it\u2019s already all about Hillary. (Even much of the liberal punditry has acknowledged that her troubles are mostly self-inflicted.) It would almost surely be four to eight years of putting out fires that have nothing to do with policy. Democrats may ask themselves whether that could work. What they should be asking themselves is whether it would be worth it.\n\nHarsanyi has a point.\n\nAfter the turmoil of the Bill Clinton years, with accusations and Congressional investigations into sexual assault, crooked land deals, drug dealing, murder, cronyism, insider trading, hanging crack pipes on the White House Christmas tree, and rampant lesbianism, the Obama years have been relatively soothing and conflict free.\n\nDespite the fact that Obama is a Kenyan-born Muslim who \u201cpalled around with terrorists,\u201d sold guns to Mexican drug lords, used the IRS to target conservatives, hates America, hates white people, hates our military, hates our flag, personally murdered our ambassador in Libya, and wants to tax people to death in order to pay for \u2018Obamaphones\u2019 which he will hand out as a gift for visiting a free Obamacare clinic during the annual \u201cAbortion Days!\u201d spring two-for-0ne sale.\n\nSo please choose wisely Democrats. Maybe a little less drama next time. And think about the person you want to spend four to eight years with that you can also bring home to an approving GOP mom and GOP dad.\n\nThat Michael Bloomberg boy seems nice.\n\nAnd such a snazzy dresser\u2026", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/shutterstock_179533397-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Conservatives want liberals to date other people, not grab the first Hillary who comes along"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e49\"", "article_summary": "One nevertheless wonders whether the latest Clinton miniscandal will lead at least some Democrats to think, Hey, why not run for president?\nIt\u2019s Slate and Michael Bloomberg as the 2016 Democratic nominee is the Slate-iest Slate pitch in the history of Slate.\nShe\u2019s not even officially running yet, and it\u2019s already all about Hillary.\nBut the next four to eight years would be about the drama surrounding Hillary.\nIt would almost surely be four to eight years of putting out fires that have nothing to do with policy."}
