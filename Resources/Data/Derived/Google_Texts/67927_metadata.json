W. Bush and brother of former president George W. Bush, was originally thought to be the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination. Mere weeks before the Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primaries, though, this is no longer the case.\n\nAs Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post wrote: \u201cHe [Bush] entered the race in the spring as the clear front-runner \u2013 a status conferred upon him by his last name\u2026But it became clear early on that Bush wasn\u2019t just rusty at this campaigning thing, he simply wasn\u2019t all that good at it. It was also obvious to anyone paying attention that Bush was badly miscast in an election cycle in which the Republican base wanted anger from its candidates. Bush does pragmatic leadership, not anger.\u201d\n\nBush is an establishment Republican, meaning he is an advocate for cutting social program spending, as well as reducing taxes on business owners. He promised that, if elected president, he would attempt to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal the Affordable Care Act. He is a defender of the Second Amendment, and in 2009, as Governor of Florida, he signed the controversial Stand-Your-Ground law that allows the use of deadly force by citizens who feel threatened. Bush is also anti-marijuana-legalization, be it medical or recreational.\n\nBy Republican primary standards, Bush is a centrist, and has run as such since he promised to do so at the start of his campaign. This can be seen in issues like gay marriage. Although he is professedly against LGBTQ marriage, arguing that businesses should be able to discriminate against such individuals on the basis of religious beliefs, when a court rendered null Florida\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage, Bush did not fight the decision, instead imploring for a \u201crespect for the rule of law.\u201d Bush has been quoted as saying he is a proponent of affirmative action, though not of quotas. He is also against abortion, unless the life of the mother is at risk.\n\nOn the issue of minority groups and oppressed peoples, specifically the gay-rights, feminist, and \u201cblack empowerment\u201d movements, Bush has made some controversial comments. In a 1995 book he co-wrote, Profiles in Character, Bush argued that minorities label themselves as such because it is advantageous for them.\n\n\u201cThe surest way to get something in today\u2019s society is to elevate one\u2019s status to that of the oppressed. Many of the modern victim movements \u2013 the gay rights movement, the feminist movement, the black empowerment movement \u2013 have attempted to get people to view themselves as part of a smaller group deserving of something from society,\u201d the book reads. \u201cIt is a major deviation from the society envisioned by Martin Luther King, who would have had people judged by the content of their character and not by the color of their skin-or sexual preference or gender or ethnicity.\u201d\n\nAs Governor of Florida, Bush made a name for himself on the issue of education, although this hasn\u2019t gained much traction in his presidential bid. He concerned himself with black students lagging behind in Florida\u2019s education system while in office. In Dade County, black students were 24 percent more likely than white students to drop out, according to The New Yorker.\n\nBush\u2019s political ideology can be seen in his effort to separate education and government, opting instead for charter schools as well as private-school vouchers. In his words: \u201cCompetition means everybody gets better.\u201d Furthermore, rather than evaluating schools based on test scores, Bush tried focusing on individual student scores.\n\nDespite his statewide effort to privatize education, there was no discernible difference in the test score gap between white students and black students, except in charter schools, where the gap increased.\n\nOn higher education, Bush is hoping to implement a plan that would have loaner\u2019s repay loans \u201cby committing a set fraction of their income over 25 years, rather than repaying based on a fixed rate of interest. So borrowers with high earnings will pay back more than they\u2019ve borrowed (up to a limit), while borrowers with low earnings will pay far less,\u201d according to the Brookings Institute.\n\nBush has also expressed support for an idea that entails two free years of community college for interested students. Ultimately, though, Bush believes colleges and universities should fix their high-cost systems individually, without government intervention.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a way to do this where you\u2019re requiring higher education institutions to reform themselves, where they don\u2019t just build in more and more costs,\u201d Bush said.\n\nA RealClearPolitics average of all major polls has Bush at 4.8 percent nationally, behind Donald Trump (34.5 percent), Ted Cruz (19.3 percent), Marco Rubio (11.8 percent) and Ben Carson (9 percent), and in front of Chris Christie (3.5 percent), Carly Fiorina (2.8 percent), John Kasich (2.3 percent), Rand Paul (2.3 percent), Mike Huckabee (1.8 percent), and Rick Santorum (0 percent).", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Daily Campus", "description": "Jeb Bush was originally thought to be the frontrunner for the Republican \r\npresidential nomination.
