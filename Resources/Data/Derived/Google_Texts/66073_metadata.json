According to officials, while the Oklahoma State Election Board's website has featured a polling place locator in the past, the enhanced tool also allows voters to view sample ballots for upcoming elections, track their absentee ballots and confirm their voter registration all in the same place.\n\n\"The new Online Voter Tool gives Oklahomans unprecedented online access to their voter information,\" said Oklahoma State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax. \"We are especially happy to have this service up and running in time for the June 24 Primary Election.\"\n\nUsers can enter their name and birth date, and those who have successfully registered to vote will see their information. Those who are not registered will get an alert telling them to contact their county election board.\n\nThe tool includes a map showing the voter's polling location and links to sample ballots for upcoming elections in which they are eligible to vote. Those who have requested an absentee ballot can also see when the ballot was sent and received by their county election board.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A new Online Voter Tool will allow Oklahomans to look up their voter registration, polling location, sample ballots and check the status of their absentee ballots all in one location.", "author": "News9.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/25515626/state-election-board-launches-online-voter-tool", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25515626_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A new Online Voter Tool will allow Oklahomans to look up their voter registration, polling location, sample ballots and check the status of their absentee ballots all in one location.", "title": "State Election Board Launches Online Voter Tool"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/25515626_SA.jpg", "description": "A new Online Voter Tool will allow Oklahomans to look up their voter registration, polling location, sample ballots and check the status of their absentee ballots all in one location.", "card": "summary", "title": "State Election Board Launches Online Voter Tool"}, "wnreadableurl": "state-election-board-launches-online-voter-tool", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/05/14", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news, online voter tool, polling location, sample ballot, voters, news 9, kwtv, news9.com, state election board.", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS29", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news, online voter tool, polling location, sample ballot, voters, news 9, kwtv, news9.com, state election board."}, "article_summary": "\"The new Online Voter Tool gives Oklahomans unprecedented online access to their voter information,\" said Oklahoma State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax.\nThe Online Voter Tool is available at http://elections.ok.gov.\nThose who are not registered will get an alert telling them to contact their county election board.\nThe State Election Board launched a new Online Voter Tool that will allow Oklahomans to look up their voter registration, polling location, sample ballots and check the status of their absentee ballots all in one location.\nThose who have requested an absentee ballot can also see when the ballot was sent and received by their county election board."}
