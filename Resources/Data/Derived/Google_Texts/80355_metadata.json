Ron Barber guides his Ford through the flat, four-lane paved streets, ticking off landmarks on the corners of his desert city surrounded by jagged mountains.\n\nThat\u2019s Rincon High School, where he enrolled as a sophomore in 1959. There\u2019s the middle school his grandson attends. As he makes a left turn, Barber points to St. Cyril of Alexandria Church, where he married his wife, Nancy, 47 years ago.\n\n\u201cIt was the middle of the summer, and what do you know, the air conditioner broke,\u201d he recalled, driving by rows of adobe office parks.\n\nOn the opposite corner of the church is another Barber landmark, former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' office, where he worked as her district director for several years. One memory sticks out: On the night of the Affordable Care Act vote, he put out a press release and left around midnight. A couple of hours later, someone shattered the office door and window. He said they later discovered bullets inside.\n\nIt\u2019s not the most notorious time Barber risked gunfire \u2014 not even close. At the main gate of the University of Arizona campus, the former state bureaucrat gestures up the road toward the trauma center where he was treated after a gunman killed six and injured a dozen more, including Barber and Giffords, in January 2011. This is not the route Barber expected to follow.\u201cIf you\u2019ve never run for office before, it\u2019s a huge jump for everyone,\u201d Barber recalled telling his wife when they first decided he would run for Giffords\u2019 seat. \u201cShe saw what happened on Jan. 8.\u201d\n\nThe 68-year-old Democrat is running his third big campaign for Giffords\u2019 seat in the highly competitive 2nd District. He\u2019ll face one of the GOP\u2019s top recruits of the cycle, retired Air Force Col. Martha McSally, at a time when the national political landscape favors Republicans. The Rothenberg Political Report/Roll Call rates the 2nd District as a Tossup . Polls show a deadlocked race, and Barber's victory partially depends on how he tells his own tale of Tucson \u2014 not that of his former boss.\n\n\u2018Gabby-fied\u2019 Barber maneuvers through the downtown college campus where he majored in political science decades earlier. He recalled his bachelor buddies dunking him in the fountain in front of \u201cOld Main\u201d before his wedding \u2014 a local tradition, he swears.\n\nThe father of two touts Tucson like it\u2019s as exciting as New York City, or Austin, Texas. The 2nd District includes east Tucson and the southeast corner of Arizona, bordering both New Mexico and Mexico.\n\nIt\u2019s nearly 30 minutes into the driving tour of his hometown before Barber brings up Giffords.\n\n\u201cI have not had one regret,\u201d he said later. \u201cI learned so much from this woman who is the same age as my eldest daughter.\u201d\n\nHe first met Giffords, then a state legislator, during his 30-year-long tenure with the region's Division of Developmental Disabilities. She would attend their information sessions for lawmakers, and he was impressed by her diligence and generosity.\n\nAfter winding through a recently renovated downtown, Barber points to the federal court house where U.S. District Judge John Roll presided until he was killed by the crazed shooter. As Barber passed Sentinel Peak, also known as \"A\" mountain because of the massive university letter on its summit, he recalled another long drive.\n\nIt was 2005. He was returning from Phoenix when he heard on local radio that Republican Rep. Jim Kolbe was retiring. Barber learned Giffords was thinking about running, and asked his wife if he could retire and help.\n\nBarber said he hadn\u2019t worked on a campaign since Mo Udall represented the 2nd District decades earlier.\n\nHe served as Giffords' community outreach director as the Democrat navigated a crowded primary and won her first term in 2006. Forgoing retirement plans, Barber was set to take a university gig when Giffords asked him to be her district director.\n\nHe didn\u2019t hesitate, partnering with Gabe Zimmerman to set up Giffords\u2019 office. (Zimmerman also died that January day.) Barber pushed the congresswoman to let him hire outside-the-box aides instead of campaign allies for his top priority, constituent services.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about fighting bureaucracy,\u201d he described. \u201cDig into the soft part of their anatomy and hold on.\u201d\n\nFour years later, Jared Lee Loughner opened fire, showering bullets on a Giffords constituent service event in front of the Casas Adobes Safeway. Barber was shot twice \u2014 through the neck and in his leg. Today, he can\u2019t feel his leg below the knee, and a dimple on his left cheek marks a bullet wound.\n\nGiffords spent months recovering from gunshot wounds to the head, embarking on a long journey to regain her mobility and speech that caused her ultimately to resign a year later. She asked Barber to seek her seat in a 2012 special election.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s a political junkie, but he never actually saw himself holding office,\u201d said Joni Jones, an office manager for Giffords and Barber.\n\nLearning to Fly It\u2019s lunchtime in the Mo Udall Room at downtown\u2019s El Charro, a restaurant that claims to have invented the chimichanga but is really known for the carne seca, beef that\u2019s been dried on the roof. To say Barber is well known in Tucson is an understatement. The British-born congressman owned a used toy store, Toy Trader/Stork\u2019s Nest. One of his aides recalled buying a car seat for her little sister there years before they worked together.\n\n\u201cHe was a longtime public servant in the community,\u201d said Tucson Mayor Jonathan Rothschild, a Democrat who has known Barber since the 1990s. \u201cIt should help him a lot. He\u2019s done an excellent job as our congressman.\u201d\n\nSince the shooting, Barber's face and name has been blasted on the Tucson airwaves. It isn't always flattering: His second-time foe, McSally, has chided him for supporting national Democrats, including President Barack Obama's health care law, which Giffords backed. McSally's victory depends on whether she can convince the district's large swath of independent voters that he's not.\n\n\u201cI watch a lot of TV, and you are on it all the time,\u201d one restaurant patron tells the congressman as they shake hands.\n\nLucky for Barber, his fellow diner meant this in the good way.\n\nAs Barber sips his Arnold Palmer, he remembers he resigned as district director on a Tuesday. He knew he would announce his campaign for Congress that Thursday. On Wednesday, he woke up with one thought.\n\n\u201cThe next day I would be staffed, instead of staffing,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI had to kind of let go. I just had to pry myself off from the day to day details.\u201d\n\nThe first month of campaigning was grueling as Barber was still recovering \u2014 emotionally and physically \u2014 from the shooting. The mild-mannered grandfather of five struggled with public speaking and the evil necessity of sound bites. He said he\u2019s still learning how to speak briefly, and he drives his staff crazy by staying too late at events talking to people.\n\nThey give him looks, then nudge his arm, and finally put a strategic hand on his upper back. He knows the drill: He used to do the same with Giffords.\n\n\u201cI should have learned from that, but I didn\u2019t,\" he said.\n\nHe recalled visiting the Safeway for the first time after the incident, where \u201cthe spot where we were shot seemed so small to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat you went through with Gabby was amazing,\u201d offered another restaurant patron who approached the table.\n\nHe fondly remembers Giffords\u2019 left eyebrow, which he could rely upon to send a signal of approval or disapproval for the topic at hand. A close-up photo of Barber and Giffords welcomes guests into his campaign headquarters in a mideast Tucson office park.\n\nToday, they see each other at events every couple weeks, including just after Giffords commemorated the third anniversary of the shooting by sky diving.\n\n\u201cGabby, you always set the bar high,\u201d he told her. \u201cBut I\u2019m not jumping out of a plane.\u201d\n\nRelated Stories: The 10 Most Vulnerable House Members On the Road: Arizona Ron Barber Airs First TV Ad (Video) Republicans Circulate List of Top Female House Candidates NRCC Reserves $30 Million for TV Ads in 2014 Roll Call Election Map: Race Ratings for Every Seat Get breaking news alerts and more from Roll Call in your inbox or on your iPhone.", "article_metadata": {"description": "TUCSON, Ariz. \u2014 Rep.
