Researchers and the general public can now submit comments and ideas for the Cancer Moonshot effort, the National Cancer Institute announced Monday.

The NCI, part of the National Institutes of Health, launched a new online platform where people can submit ideas that will be considered by the Blue Ribbon Panel, a group of experts guiding the scientific direction of the moonshot efforts. The moonshot, led by Vice President Joe Biden, was announced by President Obama in January as part of his final State of the Union address.

The announcement comes as the American Association for Cancer Research kicks off its annual meeting in New Orleans. Biden will address the group on Wednesday.

“The goal of the Moonshot Initiative is to accelerate progress in the fight against cancer by swiftly advancing knowledge from cutting-edge basic research to new prevention and treatment strategies for patients,” Douglas Lowy, acting director of the National Cancer Institute, said in a statement. “The community involvement that the initiative garners will allow us to consider novel, creative ideas that might not otherwise have come to NCI’s attention.”
