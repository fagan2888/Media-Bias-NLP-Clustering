Three months to the day, baby George, Prince of Cambridge, was christened by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at the Chapel Royal at St. James' Palace.

More eyes were on Kate's completely flattened baby bump than on the baby. Kate has magically transformed herself back to her pre-pregnancy body, a feat few women can match after delivering an 8 1/2 pound baby.

The baby has seven godparents. The christening dress is a replica of Queen Victoria's christening robe, and seems to be made of peau de soie, Alen√ßon and Brussells lace. If the robe were a women's size 2, it could have been Kate's wedding dress.

For Christians, the Baptism is a sacred rite marked by the idea of a rebirth or cleansing of sins--ergo the wearing of a white garment. In biblical times, that meant plain cloth. But over time, commoners mimicked the royals, and the royals got fancy.

You'll pay over $1,000 dollars for the dress on the left and possibly more for the Brussells lace dress on the right. But get used to it. Having a baby is only the start of a the long road to becoming a personal ATM machine for your kids.
