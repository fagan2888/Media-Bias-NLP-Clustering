Is Johannesburg, not Jersey City, the sixth borough?\n\nWhy Johannesburg?\n\nWell, that\u2019s where US Ambassador Patrick Gaspard calls home. And Blake is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Gaspard, who once headed the Democratic National Committee and the political-action arm of powerhouse union 1199 SEIU.\n\nSome Bronx Democrats are accusing Gaspard of calling his pals at 1199 SEIU urging their support of Blake \u2014 and, indeed, the union endorsed him Friday.\n\nGaspard already stands accused of violating the federal Hatch Act, which limits the political activity of federal employees. GOP operative O.B. Murray says he learned that Gaspard advised Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-Harlem) during his recent heated primary campaign.\n\nIn June, the White House Office of Special Counsel cleared Gaspard of violating the Hatch Act.

Blake says Jenkins told him that running for the Assembly was one thing, but running an opposing slate was a declaration of war.\n\nBlake said he was shocked at the audacity of the Jenkins upbraiding. But shock soon turned into compliance, as the Blake campaign severed ties with his reform slate and filed nominating petitions for his candidacy alone.\n\nRev. Bruce Rivera, the Blake-recruited candidate for district leader, says he doesn\u2019t feel bitter and continues to support Blake\u2019s Assembly bid. But other members of the slate were outraged by his betrayal.\n\nAsked for comment, Blake campaign spokesman Aaron Carr e-mailed: \u201cAfter discussion amongst the members of the slate we felt it was in the best interest of all the campaigns not to file together.\u201d\n\nA Bronx operative fresh off of Rep. Rangel\u2019s primary victory thought it was important for Blake to have local leaders on his team.\n\nBut this betrayal of his own slate could bring its own problems, he says, since \u201c[Blake] doesn\u2019t need negative word of mouth.\u201d\n\nLike many, he can\u2019t see why Blake would curry favor with County, as the local power\u00adbrokers are known.\n\nI circled back with Carr, the Blake spokesman, to ask whose best interests were served by the candidate splitting from his slate.
