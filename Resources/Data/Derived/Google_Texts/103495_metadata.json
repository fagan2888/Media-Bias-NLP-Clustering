His inaugural speech was classic Hancock: upbeat and full of sweeping generalities. Denver is hot, the millennials are flocking here. It\u2019s summertime and the livin\u2019 is easy.\n\nIn fact, the down-ballot elections reflect a different tone. The city elected an experienced and professional auditor, Tim O\u2019Brien. An incumbent council member was defeated for the first time since 1987. Five of the six remaining councilors were elected four years ago. Only at-large Councilwoman Debbie Ortega has the experience of serving with four previous mayors: Federico Pe\u00f1a, Wellington Webb, John Hickenlooper and Bill Vidal.\n\nSeveral new councilors have interesting backgrounds. Kevin Flynn was a former City Hall reporter with the Rocky Mountain News. Paul Kashmann was the longtime editor and publisher of The Washington Park Profile, a respected neighborhood newspaper. The two possess solid knowledge of the city.\n\nRafael Espinoza is an activist and an architect who trounced incumbent Susan Shepherd. Wayne New won a tight race against Anna Jones, a knowledgeable urbanist and former planning board member. Both New and Espinoza succeeded by leveraging neighborhood anxiety about over-development, congestion and threats to Denver\u2019s cherished parks and open space.\n\nHancock and his team may think their clients are the hip, young creatives flocking to Denver. They are wrong. The voters they count on to approve tax initiatives and civic improvements are primarily seniors, families with children and engaged 30- and 40-somethings who value Denver\u2019s accessible, human-scaled and relaxed way-of-life.\n\nIf your neighborhood is changing too drastically, traffic is a nightmare and there\u2019s a homeless guy living in your alley, you are angry and you will vote.\n\nMy advice to the City Council: Get out of the City and County Building and move back to your districts. The reasons:\n\n\u2022 The magnificent 1932 City and County Building is an impenetrable fortress. The front doors are sealed. Building entrances adjacent to the reserved Cherokee Street parking lots are accessible only to public officials or locked. It\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess which of the remaining six entrances is open.\n\n\u2022 Parking is expensive, inaccessible and in short supply. Though the garage beneath the Webb Building was built to serve the public, it\u2019s off-limits to all but city officials and employees.\n\n\u2022 It\u2019s challenging enough to enter the City and County Building for Monday evening council meetings. It is more challenging to locate the council\u2019s committee meeting room, hidden behind the elevators on the third floor.\n\nDenver\u2019s $1.2 billion General Fund budget is robust. Sales-tax revenues are increasing by more than 5 percent annually. Between 2013 and 2015, the mayor\u2019s office budget grew by 20 percent, the General Fund\u2019s operating budget \u2014 70 percent dedicated to personnel costs \u2014 increased by $140 million (16 percent) while the City Council\u2019s budget added a paltry $500,000 to a $4 million base.\n\nCouncil members should maintain offices within their districts. Taxpayers can afford it and deserve to have access to council offices and staff.\n\nAnother move for transparency? Publish the names, job descriptions and direct phone numbers for city employees, because the 311 information system is impenetrable.\n\nCivic activist Susan Barnes-Gelt can be reached at Barnesgelt@ gmail.com.\n\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Barnes-Gelt: Open the council doors, Denver", "title": "Barnes-Gelt: Open the council doors, Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/24/barnes-gelt-open-the-council-doors-denver/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150724__OP26BARNESp1.jpg", "height": 461}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150724__OP26BARNESp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-24T10:24:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T23:48:29+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1cd8\"", "article_summary": "My advice to the City Council: Get out of the City and County Building and move back to your districts.\n\u2022 It\u2019s challenging enough to enter the City and County Building for Monday evening council meetings.\nThough the garage beneath the Webb Building was built to serve the public, it\u2019s off-limits to all but city officials and employees.\nThe reasons:\u2022 The magnificent 1932 City and County Building is an impenetrable fortress.\nBoth New and Espinoza succeeded by leveraging neighborhood anxiety about over-development, congestion and threats to Denver\u2019s cherished parks and open space."}
