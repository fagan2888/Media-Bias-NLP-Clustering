It\u2019s a major selling season for local suppliers to parade krewes, formal galas and every kind of revelry in between.\n\n\u201cI sell Mardi Gras before I sell Christmas,\u201d said Mona McMurtry, co-owner of P&M Flowers and Gifts on South Union Street in Opelousas. \u201cPeople who are doing Mardi Gras plan ahead.\u201d\n\nBefore Thanksgiving, she said, the people who sew beading onto costumes and sequins onto ball gowns are already getting to work. Her store sells those adornments, along with garlands, feathers, wreaths, ribbons, doubloons and throw beads by the gross.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the parades in town,\u201d said McMurty, the \u201cM\u201d in her company\u2019s name. \u201cThere are parades at the schools, lots of parties...(People) buy a lot of supplies for centerpieces to decorate the tables, then have contests for the best-decorated tables.\u201d\n\nAlthough carnival season begins on the 12th day of Christmas \u2014 Jan. 6 \u2014 the final few weeks before Mardi Gras are prime time for small business owners like McMurtry.\n\nAffordable Special Events on north La. 182 in Opelousas sees a bump in its tuxedo rentals this time of year.\u201dWe have a lot of last-minute customers for the tuxedos,\u201d said saleswoman Felecia Semien. \u201cThey like the Mardi Gras vests and ties\u201d in traditional purple, green and gold, along with mask, plaid and fleur-de-lis prints.\n\n\u201cThe men try to match it to what the women wear \u2014 she gets the dress first,\u201d Semien said. This season, she added, length matters: tailcoat tuxedos and gowns with mermaid trails are popular.\n\nThere\u2019s also extra demand for catering services, fresh floral arrangements, costumes and masks, like the ones on display at Sebastien-Dupr\u00e9 Jewelers on South Main Street in Opelousas.\n\nEach is a distinct assembly of similar elements: screen door mesh, gaudy fabric, painted embellishments and oversized features. These hand-crafted masks perch amid the fine jewelry cases and gifts like grotesque visitors.\n\nThey don\u2019t stay for long, owner Robbie Sebastien said. The masks by artist Gerry Soileau, who calls herself Seaux and Seaux, are so popular they\u2019ve sold steadily each of the two years he\u2019s carried them.\n\nShe also creates traditional Mardi Gras costumes and capichons \u2014 the distinctive pointed caps. After Sebastien posted a few on his store\u2019s Facebook page, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of phone calls about them.\n\n\u201cThe masks and the capichons are the biggest sellers,\u201d he said. Those items range from $20 to $35 and \u201ccater to more of a country Mardi Gras for people in Washington, Eunice and Mamou,\u201d Sebastien said.\n\nCity customers also make special purchases during carnival time, he said. \u201cThe debutantes are looking for pearl earrings and necklaces to go with their ball gowns,\u201d and their parents, escorts and others who attend fancy dress balls freshen their looks with new jewelry.\n\nSebastien is a veteran of the cotillion scene. For the fifth consecutive year, he\u2019s captain \u2014 in effect, master of ceremonies \u2014 of the Opelousas Garden Club\u2019s Mardi Gras Bal Masque.\n\nHe said he loves the season for its intrigue, \u201cjust the feeling of being outside and unknown with masks on,\u201d and for the atmosphere in his shop.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as stressful and deadline-oriented as Christmas,\u201d Sebastien said. The overlap of carnival season and Valentine\u2019s Day is also good for business.\n\nOnce Ash Wednesday arrives and the 40 austere days of Lent set in, he and others expect a quiet spell until Easter.\n\nAlthough the pause is brief, business owners do look forward to winding down.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say,\u201d McMurtry laughed, \u201cI\u2019m closed Mardi Gras Day.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/02/07/carnival-delivers-beads-baubles-bounty-businesses/23067927/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "It\u2019s a good sales season for all things festive, from feather boas to fancy clothes", "og": {"site_name": "DailyWorld.com", "description": "It\u2019s a good sales season for all things festive, from feather boas to fancy clothes", "title": "Carnival delivers beads, baubles and bounty for businesses", "url": "http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/02/07/carnival-delivers-beads-baubles-bounty-businesses/23067927/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/dailyworld.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s a good sales season for all things festive, from feather boas to fancy clothes", "title": "Carnival delivers beads, baubles and bounty for businesses", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1d97bb660f2b673179675ea4d8579988e217c649/c=363-0-2037-1674&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Opelousas/2015/02/07/B9316117822Z.1_20150207230041_000_GI89S7GSF.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@", "site": "@", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=898315311", "fb": {"app_id": 164724483570611}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbc1e\"", "article_summary": "The overlap of carnival season and Valentine\u2019s Day is also good for business.\n\u201cThey like the Mardi Gras vests and ties\u201d in traditional purple, green and gold, along with mask, plaid and fleur-de-lis prints.\nShe also creates traditional Mardi Gras costumes and capichons \u2014 the distinctive pointed caps.\nIf you don\u2019t believe that, you haven\u2019t traded out the Chirstmas ornaments on your tree for purple, green and gold Mardi Gras bling.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say,\u201d McMurtry laughed, \u201cI\u2019m closed Mardi Gras Day.\u201dRead or Share this story: http://www.dailyworld.com/story/news/local/2015/02/07/carnival-delivers-beads-baubles-bounty-businesses/23067927/"}
