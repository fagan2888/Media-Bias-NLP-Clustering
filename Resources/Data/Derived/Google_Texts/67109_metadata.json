The original Star Trek,whose three-year TV run began in 1966, featured a talented, multiethnic crew. The indomitable Captain Kirk had the can-do sex appeal of a Kennedy; his chief advisor, the half-human, half-Vulcan Mr. Spock, offered the cool rationality of that \u201cIBM machine with legs,\u201d then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. And the USS Enterprise, on a mission \u201cto boldly go where no man has gone before,\u201d pursued a seemingly benign anthropological interest in seeking out, engaging with, and trying to understand the native populations of a fascinating variety of distant worlds.\n\nThe \u201cprime directive,\u201d designed to govern the conduct of Kirk and his crew on their episodic journey, required non-interference in the workings of alien civilizations. This approach mirrored the evolving anti-war sympathies of series creator Gene Roddenberry and many of the show\u2019s scriptwriters. The Vietnam War, which raged through the years of its initial run, was then demonstrating to more and more Americans the folly of trying to re-engineer a society distant both geographically and culturally. The best and the brightest, on Earth as on the Enterprise, began to have second thoughts in the mid-1960s about such hubris.\n\nEven as they deliberately linked violent terrestrial interventions with celestial ones, however, the makers of Star Trek never questioned the most basic premise of a series that would delight fans for decades, spawning endless TV and movie sequels. Might it not have been better for the universe as a whole if the Enterprise had never left Earth in the first place and if Earth hadn\u2019t meddled in matters beyond its own solar system?\n\nAs our country contemplates future military interventions, as well as ambitious efforts to someday colonize other planets, Americans would be smart to address this fundamental question. Might our inexhaustible capacity for interfering in far-flung places be a sign not of a dynamic civilization, but of a fatal flaw \u2014 for the country, the international community, and the species as a whole?\n\nThe Orange Zone\n\nThe United States has never had much use for a precautionary prime directive. It has interfered with \u201calien\u201d societies at a remarkable clip ever since the late nineteenth century. Indeed, such interference is inscribed in the genetic code of the country, for America is the product of the massive disruption and eradication of an already existing native population. Columbus also boldly went where no (European) man had gone before, and we recapitulate his voyage every time we send the Marines to a foreign shore or our drones into foreign air space. Native Americans didn\u2019t need \u201cdiscovering\u201d or new infectious diseases any more than Iraqis needed lectures about democracy from neoconservatives.\n\nDespite considerable evidence of just how malign our recent interventions have proven to be \u2014 in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and elsewhere \u2014 the U.S. government continues to contemplate military missions. Iran is, for the moment, off the hook, and so is Cuba. Washington has also repeatedly emphasized that North Korea is not in the crosshairs, though our aggressive military posture in East Asia might suggest otherwise, particularly to the paranoid leadership in Pyongyang.\n\nBut even the diplomacy-friendly Obama administration is still wedded to the use of drones in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and Yemen, not to mention a new secret program in Syria. It has dispatched Special Forces to 150 countries. And it has conducted, along with its coalition allies, more than 5,000 airstrikes against the Islamic State. U.S. troops remain in significant numbers in Afghanistan (9,800) and Iraq (3,500). Hundreds of U.S. military bases, with around 150,000 service personnel deployed on them, gird the globe.\n\nThese military actions have remapped the world \u2014 and not in a good way. America\u2019s post-9/11 invasions, attacks, and occupations have created a crescent of crisis that stretches from Afghanistan across the Middle East and into Africa. Fragile states, like Somalia and Yemen, have been thrown into desperate chaos. Syria and Iraq have become incubators for the most virulent strains of extremism. And authoritarian leaders in Egypt and the Gulf States are using this turmoil to justify their own iron-fist policies.\n\nEven the recent refugee crisis, the most significant since the end of World War II, can be traced back to the Bush administration\u2019s military responses to September 11th. For many years, Afghanistan was the leading exporter of refugees to the world, with Iraq a close second. Today, the leading source of refugees is Syria. Although the United States hasn\u2019t invaded that country, it has meddled there nonetheless, initially to depose Bashar al-Assad and then to \u201cdegrade\u201d the Islamic State and its affiliates. In the twenty-first century, America\u2019s efforts to reengineer societies across the planet are ending up just as badly as its twentieth-century fiasco in Southeast Asia.\n\nMeanwhile, the impulse to \u201cboldly go\u201d is no longer restricted to neo-colonial interventionism or military adventurism. There is now growing enthusiasm for sending an expeditionary force beyond Earth. Several competing initiatives aim to begin the colonization of Mars, in part to provide humanity with an alternative should global warming make planet Earth inhospitable to human life. These extraterrestrial efforts reflect a growing anxiety that the end is nigh, at least for the home team.\n\nIndeed, many writers (not to speak of scientists) have postulated that Earth is reaching a tipping point. Whether as a function of nuclear weapons, carbon emissions, or sheer reproductive fervor, humans seem to be approaching an important threshold in our life on the planet.\n\nLet\u2019s call it the Orange Zone, in honor of the erstwhile terrorism color index. For the last half-century or so, humans have had the capacity to blow up the planet with our nuclear toys. We have also been burning up fossil fuels at a remarkable and increasing rate in a burst of economic activity that has brought us to the brink of irreparably destroying the ecosystem. And we have reproduced so successfully that, like voracious locusts, we threaten to outstripthe planet\u2019s capacity to feed us.\n\nIf we can figure out how to lower the threat alert and leave the Orange Zone, we will have passed the civilizational test. Once we put away our childish things \u2014 our nuclear weapons, our coal-fired power plants, our religious prohibitions against contraception \u2014 we can graduate to the next level of planetary consciousness. Otherwise, we flunk out. And there won\u2019t be any make-up summer school credits available.\n\nThere may, in fact, be an even more fundamental test than the nuclear, carbon, or demographic challenges. And that\u2019s the human propensity for intervention \u2014 across borders, over seas, and potentially even in outer space. That Star Trek urge \u201cto boldly go,\u201d obeying the prime directive or not, has gotten humanity into a heap of trouble. Establishing outposts in far-off lands is often considered the ultimate American insurance policy, but it\u2019s precisely our predilection for getting mixed up in other people\u2019s messes that has distracted us from fixing our own. The focus on setting up a colony on Mars, instead of getting serious about climate change on Earth, is the functional equivalent of devoting close to a trillion dollars a year to the U.S. military instead of using that money to fix all that is broken at home. Talk about an advanced case of attention-deficit disorder.\n\nThe Chinese Way\n\nIn the fifteenth century, the Chinese admiral Zheng He took a fleet on seven voyages throughout Asia, to the Middle East, and as far as Africa. He defeated marauding pirates in the vicinity of China and intervened militarily in far-off Ceylon. His huge treasure ships, each one six times larger than Columbus\u2019s Santa Maria, brought back rare items, including a giraffe, for the Chinese emperor. As a diplomat, he established tributary relations with dozens of foreign lands, though not Europe, which was still too backward to attract Chinese interest. Zheng\u2019s last journey, in the early 1430s, took place two decades before Christopher Columbus was even born.\n\nZheng He\u2019s maritime explorations might have served as the basis for China\u2019s colonial domination of significant parts of the world. But it was not to be. \u201cShortly after the last voyage of the treasure fleet, the Chinese emperor forbade overseas travel and stopped all building and repair of oceangoing junks,\u201d Louise Levathes has written in When China Ruled the Seas. \u201cDisobedient merchants and seamen were killed, and within a hundred years the greatest navy the world had ever known willed itself into extinction.\u201d\n\nChina didn\u2019t entirely turn its back on colonialism. It maintained a tributary system in its Asian backyard. Nor did the Middle Kingdom immediately lose out to a rising Europe, for the Chinese would remain a dominant force for several more centuries. Still, the emperor\u2019s decision to renounce Zheng He and his accomplishments is often identified as a key pivot point in modern history. China effectively decided not to go the way of the Enterprise. It would not \u201cboldly go\u201d into unexplored lands or establish a far-flung colonial empire. Nor did it develop the military means to police such domains.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As our military boldly goes where no other country's will, we must dispense with the illusion we're a force of good", "author": "John Feffer", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As our military boldly goes where no other country's will, we must dispense with the illusion we're a force of good", "title": "America\u2019s \u201cStar Trek\u201d fantasy: Intervention is a noble endeavor", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/19/resisting_the_lure_of_intervention_the_search_for_terrestrial_intelligence_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/ukb96uripfacguvyswpb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As our military boldly goes where no other country's will, we must dispense with the illusion we're a force of good", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/ukb96uripfacguvyswpb.jpg", "title": "America\u2019s \u201cStar Trek\u201d fantasy: Intervention is a noble endeavor", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "America\u2019s \u201cStar Trek\u201d fantasy: Intervention is a noble endeavor", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, deep space, Star Trek, TomDispatch.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "That Star Trek urge \u201cto boldly go,\u201d obeying the prime directive or not, has gotten humanity into a heap of trouble.\nSeveral competing initiatives aim to begin the colonization of Mars, in part to provide humanity with an alternative should global warming make planet Earth inhospitable to human life.\nBut even the diplomacy-friendly Obama administration is still wedded to the use of drones in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and Yemen, not to mention a new secret program in Syria.\nDespite considerable evidence of just how malign our recent interventions have proven to be \u2014 in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and elsewhere \u2014 the U.S. government continues to contemplate military missions.\nTopics: deep space, Star Trek, TomDispatch.com, Entertainment News, Politics NewsThis piece originally appeared on TomDispatchThey were the \u201cbest and the brightest\u201d but on a spaceship, not planet Earth, and they exemplified the liberal optimism of their era."}
