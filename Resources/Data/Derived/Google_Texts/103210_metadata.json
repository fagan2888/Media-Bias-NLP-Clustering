The Senate version of the legislation also would have extended a tax code provision allowing businesses to expense the costs of qualifying property in the year it is placed in service, rather than depreciating the costs over time. The $12 measure would increase the minimum wage in five annual steps, without a similar tax offset.\n\nMcDonald's paid Brownstein Hyatt $80,000 in the first quarter of this year to lobby on the minimum wage, joint-employer liability and other issues, according to a federal lobbying disclosure form. The firm also listed minimum wage among a number of issues for which McDonald's paid it $310,000 to lobby Congress in 2014.\n\nCompany-Owned Restaurants to Dwindle\n\nMcDonald's announced in April that it plans to boost the pay for workers at company-owned restaurants to more than $10 per hour on average by the end of next year and to begin offering paid vacation time. The move doesn't apply to workers at the more than 30,000 McDonald's franchises in the U.S., which make up about 90 percent of the company's restaurants.\n\nOn May 4, McDonald's unveiled a company turnaround plan to fight flagging profits, including by franchising more restaurants. As part of that plan, the company said it plans to sell more than 3,500 company-owned restaurants worldwide to franchisees.\n\nJudy Conti, the National Employment Law Project's federal advocacy coordinator, cited what she called the \u201chypocrisy\u201d of the company cutting nearly in half the number of restaurant workers it employs so soon after announcing that it would boost those employees' paychecks. She also said McDonald's effectively depresses wages for franchisee workers by controlling most of their franchisees' food, property, equipment and other business costs.\n\n\u201cIt's part and parcel of the regular efforts by big business to deny workers a living wage,\u201d Conti said of the company's stance on minimum wage legislation. \u201cIt's not the minimum wage increase that could be breaking the backs of these franchisees, it's all of the costs that McDonald's puts on the businesses.\u201d\n\nOther Groups Express Concerns\n\nSome industry groups with which the company is affiliated have also expressed concerns about a federal wage hike. The National Restaurant Association, which counts McDonald's among its more than 150 members, opposes minimum wage legislation that doesn't include tax or other offsets for businesses.\n\nAngelo Amador, the group's vice president of labor and workforce policy, told Bloomberg BNA May 4 that the organization didn't oppose the minimum wage hike measure signed into law by President George W. Bush in 2007 because it included a $4.8 billion small business tax package.\n\nThe International Franchise Association, which has lobbied strongly against expansion of joint employer liability and lists McDonald's as a partner in its Franchise Action Network, lobbied against the $10.10 minimum wage bill in 2014 and opposes the $12 measure.\n\n\u201cAs we have seen over the past several months, many major companies that have raised their wage level are proof that market forces, the free enterprise system, not government mandates, are the best way to encourage increases in wages that may be necessary for employers to recruit, develop and maintain quality employees to remain competitive in the communities in which they operate,\u201d IFA President Steve Caldeira said in a statement following the $12 measure's introduction last month.\n\nTwo major national retail companies that announced they were voluntarily raising low-wage workers pay earlier this year\u2014Wal-Mart and Target\u2014didn't disclose any lobbying activity on the federal minimum wage issue during the first quarter.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Chris Opfer in Washington at copfer@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Susan J.
