The words "jiggery-pokery," which Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia included in his dissent on Obamacare, weren't exactly racist, Larry Wilmore joked during his interpretation of Scalia's interpretation of the court ruling to uphold subsidies. But they seemed, he concluded, a bit "racist adjacent."

Or maybe the term comes from some old English phrase for hokey pokey in a tool shed? Whatever the meaning of Scalia's often strange choice of words -- including calling the ruling "pure applesauce" and stating that words essentially have no meaning -- late-night comic Wilmore has apparently become the ultimate Scalia-to-public translator. Take a look at today's webisode of Punchlines to see what else the comic had to say about the ruling and Scalia's off beat interpretive choices.

And what does this ruling mean in practical terms? Jimmy Kimmel gives us a list of injuries and daring behavior that are OK because the medical bill is now on America. And Seth Meyers talks lingering Internet problems that still may do the program in.
