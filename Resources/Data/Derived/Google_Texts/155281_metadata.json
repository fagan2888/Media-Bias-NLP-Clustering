Mark L. Pryor of Arkansas \u2014 \u201cPryorLovesObamaCare.com\u201d \u2014 \u201cthat we would have gladly donated to the campaigns had they showed up,\u201d according to the chairman.\n\n\u201cIt looks like it\u2019s just me this morning,\u201d Mr. Priebus said.\n\nThe event was billed as the \u201cWe\u2019re Running on Obamacare\u201d news conference and underscores rising confidence among Republicans in the wake of the botched rollout of President Obama\u2019s health law and rising popular discontent with provisions of the law that have resulted in millions of canceled health policies.\n\n\u201cThey created this problem,\u201d Mr. Priebus said. \u201cThey knew this would happen.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, reports that House Republicans devised a playbook to assault Obamacare in \u201cwaves\u201d have prompted recriminations on the Hill.\n\nDrip by drip, House Republicans have leaked email chains from the Obama administration officials responsible for building Obamacare\u2019s flawed federal website, HealthCare.gov.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have accused GOP lawmakers of trying to dismantle Obamacare without offering a viable alternative.\n\n\u201cWe already know that the House Republican agenda for next year is completely blank; they simply have no solutions to the challenges Americans face,\u201d said Drew Hammill, spokesman for House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, California Democrat. \u201cNow, given their lack of any proactive ideas, it is clear their focus will continue to be on scare tactics designed to discourage people from seeking health coverage.\u201d\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, said Thursday he can\u2019t blame Democrats for trying to change the subject on Capitol Hill, amid reports that the website of Cover Oregon, one of the state-based health care exchange websites, hasn\u2019t enrolled a single person and that a Colorado man\u2019s dog was enrolled by mistake in that state\u2019s program.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d probably be running for the exit, too, if I voted for this law,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Priebus said the country should have tried a variety of health care reforms instead of Obamacare, from more transparent pricing on health services to cost-saving measures to a framework in which people purchase coverage in larger risk pools.\n\nFor its part, the Democratic National Committee said the GOP hasn\u2019t learned from the 2012 election or the recent government shutdown, singling the opposition to Obamacare of Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Republican.\n\n\u201cGiven that polls show more people believe in Big Foot than approve of the GOP and the fact that the RNC\u2019s last two big pushes were to unveil an \u2018Autopsy Report\u2019 that failed within days, and a \u2018Stand with Cruz\u2019 campaign egging on the GOP shutdown that cost the country $24 billion, you\u2019ll have to excuse us if we choose not to take public relations advice from Reince Priebus and the RNC,\u201d DNC spokesman Michael Czin said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Thursday his party stands ready to \"tattoo Obamacare\" on the foreheads of vulnerable Democrats in next year's election cycle.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Thursday his party stands ready to \u201ctattoo Obamacare\u201d on the foreheads of vulnerable Democrats in next year\u2019s election cycle.", "title": "Reince Priebus: GOP to \u2018tattoo\u2019 Obamacare disaster on 2014 Democrats", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/nov/21/reince-priebus-gop-tattoo-obamacare-disaster-2014-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/08/05/8_5_2013_state-gop-dysfunction-38201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/08/05/8_5_2013_state-gop-dysfunction-38201.jpg", "title": "Reince Priebus: GOP to \u2018tattoo\u2019 Obamacare disaster on 2014", "description": "Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said Thursday his party stands ready to \"tattoo Obamacare\" on the foreheads of vulnerable Democrats in next year's election cycle.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Reince Priebus, Republican National Committee"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7319\"", "article_summary": "Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus vowed Thursday that his party will \u201ctattoo\u201d Obamacare on the foreheads of vulnerable Democrats going into next year\u2019s midterm election cycle.\nDrip by drip, House Republicans have leaked email chains from the Obama administration officials responsible for building Obamacare\u2019s flawed federal website, HealthCare.gov.\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have accused GOP lawmakers of trying to dismantle Obamacare without offering a viable alternative.\n\u201cThey knew this would happen.\u201dAt the same time, reports that House Republicans devised a playbook to assault Obamacare in \u201cwaves\u201d have prompted recriminations on the Hill.\nMr. Priebus, speaking from RNC headquarters on Capitol Hill, said he invited a group of Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2014 and select House Democrats to the news briefing so they could sing the Affordable Care Act\u2019s praises from the podium."}
