U.S. worries about China's increasingly assertive territorial claims are expected to be high on the agenda.\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Defense Department, Commander Bill Urban, declined to comment specifically on Poling's assessment, but repeated U.S. calls for a halt to land reclamation, construction and militarization of South China Sea outposts to \"ease tensions and create space for diplomatic solutions.\"\n\n\"China's stated intentions with its program, and continued construction, will not reduce tensions or lead to a meaningful diplomatic solution,\" he added.\n\nA new airstrip at Mischief Reef would be particularly worrying for the Philippines, a rival claimant in the South China Sea. It would allow China to mount \"more or less constant\" patrols over Reed Bank, where the Philippines has long explored for oil and gas, Poling said.\n\nThree airstrips, once completed, would allow China to threaten all air traffic over the features it has reclaimed in the South China Sea, he said, adding that it would be especially worrying if China were to install advanced air defenses.\n\nThe Philippine government had no immediate comment.\n\nChina stepped up creation of artificial islands in the South China Sea last year, drawing strong criticism from Washington.\n\n(Additional reporting by Ben Blanchard in Beijing and Manuel Mogato in Manila; Editing by Jonathan Oatis, Christian Plumb and Dean Yates)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China appears to be carrying out preparatory work for a third a", "title": "China appears to be working on third airstrip on disputed South China Sea islets: expert", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/14/China-building-third-airstrip-disputed-South-China-Sea-islets-expert", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/southchinasea-usa-china-navy-video_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/09/14/China-building-third-airstrip-disputed-South-China-Sea-islets-expert", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/southchinasea-usa-china-navy-video_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China appears to be carrying out preparatory work for a third a", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe293b\"", "article_summary": "China stepped up creation of artificial islands in the South China Sea last year, drawing strong criticism from Washington.\nA new airstrip at Mischief Reef would be particularly worrying for the Philippines, a rival claimant in the South China Sea.\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - China appears to be carrying out preparatory work for a third airstrip in contested territory in the South China Sea, a U.S. expert said on Monday, citing satellite photographs taken last week.\nThree airstrips, once completed, would allow China to threaten all air traffic over the features it has reclaimed in the South China Sea, he said, adding that it would be especially worrying if China were to install advanced air defenses.\nSatellite photographs from late June showed China had almost finished a 3,000-meter airstrip on Fiery Cross."}
