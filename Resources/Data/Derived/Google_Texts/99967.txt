A pit bull is expected to be OK after it was shot by a Maricopa County sheriff’s deputy Saturday morning.

Deputies said they were serving an arrest warrant at a home in Mesa when a large dog emerged and started running aggressively toward them, MCSO spokesperson Courtney Palma said.

“Deputies were put in an unfortunate situation to protect themselves and had to shoot the dog once to contain it just before it attacked the deputy,” Palma said.

The deputies were near the sidewalk at the time, Palma said.

The dog was shot in the cheek.
