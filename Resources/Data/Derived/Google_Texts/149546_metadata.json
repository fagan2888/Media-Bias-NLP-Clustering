The effort is part of a law passed in 2010 that sets nutrition benchmarks for public schools. However, a wave of GOP lawmakers are pushing a measure that would exempt many schools from the new standards \u2013 which among other things require that school lunches include more fresh fruits, whole grains and vegetables.\n\nThe new meal standards are particularly important for the 28 million low-income children who depend on school meals for the bulk of their daily nutrition, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than 90 percent of schools have embraced the new standards, according the Agriculture Department.\n\nHowever, critics complain that many students across the country are resisting \u2013 and even dumping -- the new, healthier fare in favor of more popular junk food like pizza and French fries. They say that schools are simply wasting money they can\u2019t afford trying to force young people to eat healthier meals.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t force students to eat something they don\u2019t want,\u201d Lyman Graham, food service director for consolidated schools near Roswell, N.M., told The Washington Post recently. \u201cMany families in the Southwest will not accept whole-grain tortillas.\u201d\n\nThe House Appropriations Committee approved an Agriculture Department spending bill late last month that would waive many of the new meal standards in a substantial number of school districts across the country, provided those districts could show a net loss in its food service program for a six-month period. The Senate is considering companion legislation that would also undercut reforms aimed at improving children\u2019s nutrition and combatting childhood obesity.\n\nRelated: U.S. Obesity Rate Hits a Costly New High\n\nOn Wednesday, Michelle Obama invited a group of health and science reporters to the White House where she vowed again to fight attempts to delay enforcement of the school lunch nutrition standards, The Washington Post reported. \u201cI find myself surprised that we\u2019re here because just a few years ago, everybody was around the table celebrating this victory, that school nutrition standards had been improved for the first time in 30 years. And everyone was on board.\u201d\\\n\nShe acknowledged that it has been a considerable challenge to wean high school students off of junk food laced with high levels of fat and sodium, especially among older students. \u201cBut what we did not expect was for the grown-ups to go along with them and say \u2018well this is too hard, it costs too much money,\u201d she said. \u201cSo let\u2019s just stop\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe drive for temporary waivers to the 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act that was signed into law by President Obama has drawn strong support from Republican lawmakers and the School Nutrition Association, a major lobbying group which operates in concert with food companies that supply breakfast and lunch meals to schools, the Post reported. Many Democratic lawmakers and public health organizations and advocates have lined up behind Obama to oppose the waivers.\n\nAs The Post points out, many of the lawmakers attempting to gut the nutrition standards come from a region dubbed the \"diabetes belt\" by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention because of the rampant rate of obesity there.\n\n\u201cA dozen of these Republican lawmakers represent states with the dubious distinction of having rates of overweight and obese children among the 10 highest in the nation,\u201d Slate reported. \u201cAmong the worst offenders, according to the 2011 National Survey of Children's Health: Alabama, home to Rep. Robert Aderholt, the subcommittee chairman in charge of setting funding levels for school nutrition programs and the chief architect of the waiver provision; Kentucky, represented by Appropriations Chairman Hal Rogers; and Texas, which boasts a trio of its own powerful Appropriations subcommittee chairmen.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:\n\nHow Growing Partisanship Is Splitting the U.S. in Two\n\nRelentless Incompetence: Americans Are Giving Up on Obama\n\nThe Biggest Policy Mistake of the Great Recession", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Obama administration\u2019s effort to combat obesity has drawn some unfavorable scrutiny from Republican lawmakers, a large number of school districts and lobbyists for food companies that sell frozen pizzas, French fries and other prepared food for schools.
