The current recovery has been defined by slow GDP growth and even slower productivity growth. Some economists believe these are the predictable effects of a \u201cdebt supercycle.\u201d Others worry that we face a long-term problem of \u201csecular stagnation.\u201d Still others blame recent fiscal, regulatory, and monetary policies.\n\nOne thing is clear: Lawmakers need a comprehensive agenda for broad-based prosperity.\n\nWe need to transfer more of our tax burden from income to consumption. We need to rebalance federal spending so that entitlements don\u2019t crowd out basic research and development and other valuable discretionary programs. We need to expand apprenticeships so that high-school students have more pathways to a successful career. We need to transition toward a skill-based immigration system that serves our national interest.\n\nWe also need to get rid of pointless occupational-licensing requirements that discourage work and entrepreneurship. We need to rethink land-use restrictions that constrain housing supply. We need to eliminate the Affordable Care Act\u2019s employer health-insurance mandate in order to protect full-time jobs. We need to adopt patent rules that promote real innovation while curbing abusive litigation. We need to end \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and make our financial system more conducive to stable economic growth. And we need to insist that all major federal regulations receive congressional approval before taking effect.\n\nSuch reforms would increase opportunity and improve living standards.\n\nClick here to continue reading the 6-page policy focus in PDF.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://iwf.org/publications/2798246/Policy-Focus:-An-Agenda-For-Broad-Based-Prosperity", "image": "http://i1202.photobucket.com/albums/bb366/IWF11/prosperity_policyfocus_zpsusbd0o5z.png", "type": "website", "title": "Policy Focus: An Agenda For Broad-Based Prosperity"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i1202.photobucket.com/albums/bb366/IWF11/prosperity_policyfocus_zpsusbd0o5z.png"}, "title": "Policy Focus: An Agenda For Broad-Based Prosperity", "domain": "http://iwf.org", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@iwf"}, "author": "Rachel DiCarlo Currie", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Policy Focus: An Agenda For Broad-Based Prosperity"}, "article_summary": "One thing is clear: Lawmakers need a comprehensive agenda for broad-based prosperity.\nHome / Publications / ArticlePolicy Focus: An Agenda For Broad-Based ProsperityRachel DiCarlo CurrieMore than six years after the official end of the Great Recession, America\u2019s economy continues to disappoint.\nClick here to continue reading the 6-page policy focus in PDF.\nWe need to end \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and make our financial system more conducive to stable economic growth.\nWe need to rebalance federal spending so that entitlements don\u2019t crowd out basic research and development and other valuable discretionary programs."}
