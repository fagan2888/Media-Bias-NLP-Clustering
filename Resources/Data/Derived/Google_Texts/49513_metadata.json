C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter, right, talks with reporters (Otto Kitsinger/AP)\n\nConservatives who want to overturn the controversial voluntary education standards known as Common Core have run into roadblocks in states across the country, largely erected by fellow Republicans who support the program.\n\nIn some states, measures requiring state boards of education to drop the math and English standards have advanced through committees. But in three Republican-controlled states \u2014 Arizona, North Dakota and South Dakota \u2014 Common Core repeals have lost critical votes in just the past two weeks.\n\nThe outlook for similar repeal measures in states like Mississippi, Kansas, New Hampshire, Arizona and Montana are grim as well.\n\n\u201cWe feel very confident that we\u2019re on the right track, that we\u2019ve overcome most of the resistance\u201d to Common Core, Idaho Gov. Butch Otter (R), a Common Core supporter, told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nThe Common Core standards, initially a program of the National Governors Association, have become a touchstone for conservative opponents who say the standards have become a tool for federal intervention in local education systems, after eleven states asked the Department of Education for permission to use federal grants to implement the standards. Few issues, including the Affordable Care Act, so outrage conservative activists.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to two words: Barack Obama,\u201d Mike Petrilli, president of the conservative Forham Institute and a Common Core supporter, said in explaining the opposition.\n\nLegislators and governors in 45 states and the District of Columbia adopted the Common Core standards for math and English education. A 46th state, Minnesota, adopted only the English standard. As opposition mounted, legislators in a dozen states are undertaking reviews of the standards. But so far, only Oklahoma, Indiana and South Carolina have actually passed measures to drop out of Common Core.\n\n(Supporters point out that Indiana\u2019s new standards are virtually identical to Common Core, albeit under a different name, and that South Carolina remains a participant in the Common Core program until it develops alternative standards.)\n\nConservatives in more than a dozen states have introduced or plan to introduce measures dropping out of, or taking steps toward ending, Common Core. Those measures have made progress in a few states, but only one \u2014 in New Hampshire \u2014 has actually passed a state legislative chamber. That bill, which passed the state Senate this week, would prohibit the state\u2019s Department of Education and Board of Education from implementing standards in local school districts.\n\nThe New Hampshire bill now heads to the state House, which Republicans control. But if it passes, it\u2019s likely to be blocked by Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, who supports Common Core.\n\nBills in two other states have advanced through legislative committees. In Montana, a repeal has passed both the House Education and Appropriations Committees in the last week. It passed the full House on second reading, though a final vote on third reading is required to send it to the Senate.\n\nIn Arizona, the House Education Committee last week passed a repeal measure that would require new standards for English, math, science and American history.\n\nBut both bills face an uncertain future. As in New Hampshire, Montana\u2019s legislature is entirely controlled by Republicans, but Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock is a Common Core supporter who could exercise his veto power. In Arizona, the governor isn\u2019t the problem \u2014 Gov. Doug Ducey (R) opposes Common Core, a spokesman said \u2014 but the state Senate voted down a repeal bill earlier this week.\n\nMississippi\u2019s state Senate voted earlier this week to establish a commission that would recommend a replacement for the Common Core standards. But opponents of Common Core voted present in protest of the bill, which only gives the commission the power to recommend, rather than require, alternative standards. An amendment to give the commission more power failed by a wide margin.\n\nCommon Core opponents still have the opportunity to repeal standards in states like Kansas or West Virginia, where bills await hearings before legislative panels. The Kansas House Education Committee heard testimony on its bill earlier this week, though the chairman has not called a vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Repeal efforts in three states have failed in recent weeks, and the outlook in three more states is grim.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Repeal efforts in three states have failed in recent weeks, and the outlook in three more states is grim.", "title": "Common Core opponents face hurdles in repeal efforts", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/02/25/common-core-opponents-face-hurdles-in-repeal-efforts/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/files/2014/01/Legislative_Preview-0ef7a_image_982w.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@postreid"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2015/02/25/common-core-opponents-face-hurdles-in-repeal-efforts/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "education, newsletter, states, Common Core, repeal, New Hampshire, Montana, Arizona, Kansas, West Virginia, Mississippi, South Dakota, North Dakota", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "education, newsletter, states, Common Core, repeal, New Hampshire, Montana, Arizona, Kansas, West Virginia, Mississippi, South Dakota, North Dakota"}, "_id": "\"57477af56914bd0286fe5016\"", "article_summary": "Common Core opponents still have the opportunity to repeal standards in states like Kansas or West Virginia, where bills await hearings before legislative panels.\n\u201cWe feel very confident that we\u2019re on the right track, that we\u2019ve overcome most of the resistance\u201d to Common Core, Idaho Gov.\n(Supporters point out that Indiana\u2019s new standards are virtually identical to Common Core, albeit under a different name, and that South Carolina remains a participant in the Common Core program until it develops alternative standards.)\nBut so far, only Oklahoma, Indiana and South Carolina have actually passed measures to drop out of Common Core.\nButch Otter (R), a Common Core supporter, told reporters on Wednesday."}
