Camera, Jessie James. Action, Wesley Woodyard.\n\nA few hours after the Broncos-Eagles game in Denver is finished Sunday, the E network will debut the reality TV show \u201cEric & Jessie: Game On.\u201d\n\nThe show features Decker, a Broncos wide receiver, and his wife, a country and pop singer, in the weeks leading up to their wedding in June.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not nervous about it,\u201d Decker said Friday in the locker room at Broncos headquarters. \u201cI decided to do it, so why be nervous? I realize it might change as far as going out and doing things. But we still feel like normal people.\u201d\n\nHow the public perceives the couple\u2019s show is one thing. What the guys in the locker room think about it is another. There\u2019s a pretty good chance Decker will be unmercifully ribbed.\n\n\u201cI will say Woodyard is in the first (episode),\u201d Decker said with a smile, referring to one of his best friends on the team and Denver\u2019s starting middle linebacker. \u201cSo if junk is getting passed around, we\u2019re going down together.\u201d\n\nThe show premieres Sunday at 8 p.m.\n\nChamp, Duke questionable. Meaning zero disrespect to a 12-time Pro Bowl cornerback, the Broncos have become accustomed to playing without Champ Bailey this season. It is Duke Ihenacho\u2019s ankle injury that might cause the Denver defense to make a significant adjustment.\n\nIhenacho didn\u2019t participate in the Broncos\u2019 two full practices this week, though he was out there on a limited basis Friday. Ihenacho, a first-year starting safety, has brought a Brian Dawkins-like presence to Denver\u2019s defense this season.\n\nIhenacho and Bailey will be game-time decisions Sunday. There seemed to be more optimism earlier in the week about Bailey playing against the Eagles.\n\nLuckily for the Broncos, they have able replacements for both players. Cornerback Tony Carter has recovered from his ankle injury. And strong safety Mike Adams made 17 starts last season.\n\nElsewhere on the Denver injury report, linebacker Paris Lenon was listed as doubtful to play Sunday because of a strained quad and tight end Joel Dreessen (knee) was upgraded to questionable.\n\nProtecting the protector. Adam Gase took the blame for the sack that left tackle Chris Clark gave up late in the third quarter Monday night against Oakland.\n\nGase, the Broncos\u2019 fast-starting offensive coordinator and play caller, said he should not have put Clark in position to get beat by Raiders defensive end Lamarr Houston, who not only sacked quarterback Peyton Manning but forced a fumble too.\n\n\u201cThat was a ball holder,\u201d Gase said, meaning the play called for Manning to spend an extra second to look into the end zone for a receiver on the first-down snap from Oakland\u2019s 13-yard line. \u201cWe didn\u2019t need it, and that would be one where I\u2019d want to take back because our guys, if we put them in the right positions, they make it work. I feel like on that play (with) that play call, I didn\u2019t put them in the right position. That one bothers me and that\u2019s one that I\u2019m going to make sure doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Broncos briefs: reality TV show starring Eric Decker, Jessie James debuts Sunday night", "title": "Broncos briefs: reality TV show starring Eric Decker, Jessie James debuts Sunday night", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/09/27/broncos-briefs-reality-tv-show-starring-eric-decker-jessie-james-debuts-sunday-night/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130927__eric-decker-jessie-james-reality-broncos-SP21FBNBRONX_2JL0216xp1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20130927__eric-decker-jessie-james-reality-broncos-SP21FBNBRONX_2JL0216xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-28T01:20:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T10:43:39+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfdd8\"", "article_summary": "I feel like on that play (with) that play call, I didn\u2019t put them in the right position.\n\u201cI\u2019m not nervous about it,\u201d Decker said Friday in the locker room at Broncos headquarters.\nThere seemed to be more optimism earlier in the week about Bailey playing against the Eagles.\nIt is Duke Ihenacho\u2019s ankle injury that might cause the Denver defense to make a significant adjustment.\nIhenacho didn\u2019t participate in the Broncos\u2019 two full practices this week, though he was out there on a limited basis Friday."}
