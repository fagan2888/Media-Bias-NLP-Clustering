Editor’s note: The Courier-Tribune coverage of the June 7 primary continues today with a look at the District 6 congressional race. Unfortunately, both candidates failed to respond to the paper’s questionnaire.

ASHEBORO — On Thursday, voters will be able to cast ballots in early voting for the June 7 primary for congressional districts on the new maps, an associate justice seat on the N.C. Supreme Court and three local municipal alcohol referendums.

In Randolph County, Republicans and unaffiliated voters can cast a ballot for two Republicans running for the District 6 race. Everyone can vote in the N.C. Supreme Court race. Only those who live within the town limits of Franklinville, Seagrove and Ramseur can vote in those individual alcohol referendums.

Randolph County had been in District 2, currently represented by incumbent U.S. Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C. When the congressional map was redrawn, Randolph County moved into District 6. District 6 is made up of Rockingham, Caswell, Person, Alamance, Chatham, Randolph and part of Guilford counties.

We tried

The Courier-Tribune reached out to incumbent U.S. Rep. Mark Walker and challenger Chris Hardin via email with questions about issues in this campaign. Neither candidate responded. When an effort was made to reach the candidates by phone, the mailbox message for both candidates indicated the in-box was full and could not accept any more messages.

Walker lives in Greensboro and is a Baptist pastor who won the District 6 seat formerly held by Howard Coble when Coble announced his retirement in 2014. Upon election to Congress, he was assigned to committees on Homeland Security, Oversight and Government Reform and House Administration. He is generally considered to be a conservative representative.

According to the website, Congress.gov, Walker has sponsored 12 bills and co-sponsored 123. None of the measures Walker has sponsored have moved beyond the House. Two measures he has co-sponsored — the Protecting Affordable Care for Employees Act (HB 1624) and DHS IT Duplication Reduction Act (HR 1626) — have become law.

Walker has visited Randolph County numerous times, according to some sources, but neither his campaign nor his office has reached out to the local press. When asked, his representative Zach Farmer said, Walker is trying to be sensitive to the fact that, technically, Randolph County is still in Rep. Renee Ellmers’ district.

For more information on measures Walker has been involved with, visit Congress.gov and search for his name. His campaign website is www.walker4nc.com.

Hardin lives in Brown Summit and is a specialty pharmaceutical representative, having previously served in law enforcement. On his campaign website, Hardin calls himself “a constitutional conservative who believes in a republic and not a democracy.” His campaign website is www.hardin4congress.com.

It is unclear whether Hardin has visited Randolph County during his campaign.

The questions

The following is a list of the questions sent to the candidates:

* 1A) In discussions about illegal immigration, the candidates in the District 6 race seem to be advocating securing the borders. What borders? The southern border? The coastlines? The Canadian border? All of the above?

* 1B) How would this border security be paid for and by whom? How much are you willing to spend on this program?

* 1C) If you support deportation, what is your plan of work to deport the estimated 12 million undocumented people in the U.S.? If you don’t support mass deportation, what is the alternative?

* 2A) Both candidates in this race are interested in supporting more funding for the military. To what end? Do you envision a military that deals mainly with securing the physical borders of the U.S.?

* 2B) Are you interesting in sending more troops to the Middle East or some other country?

* 2C) When you speak of “funding the military” are you talking about more pay for soldiers or greater benefits for military veterans or more investment in technology that reduces the need for “boots on the ground” in dangerous areas or something else?

* 2D) Since money is finite, what would you cut to pay for increased military funding?

* 3) For all of the debate about the Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare), the fact remains that even with Republican control, there has not been enough support to repeal the measure. In polls, people report being against ACA (Kaiser: 49 percent to 38 percent), but they also feel government should ensure citizens have access to healthcare (Pew Center: 51 percent to 46 percent). One could argue leaving matters to the marketplace doesn’t work either as doctors, insurers, lawyers and hospitals tend to favor policies that benefit their bottom lines. Where would you find compromise to ensure a system that allows people to access healthcare without bankrupting their families?

Note: The following questions are in reference to HB2. HB2 is not a federal bill. It originated in the N.C. General Assembly. However, the issue has become relevant on a federal level because it has now moved to the federal courts.

* 4A) North Carolina has ignited a firestorm over the issue of non-discrimination for transgenders. While supporters of HB2 argue the measure is designed to protect women and children, they can’t show evidence that any man has posed as a transgender to assault women or children in a bathroom or shower. There have been many cases where women with boyish features or masculine dress (but they are not transgender) have been harassed or assaulted in bathrooms because of the hysteria over this law. Do you believe HB2 has truly made women/children safer?

* 4B) If you support this part of HB2, how would you enforce it?

* 4C) The economic impact of HB2 is now documented in the millions of dollars through lost tourism and business expansion, not to mention all the negative reports written about the state. How much damage should North Carolina sustain before the damages become too much to bear? And, does that matter? Is the moral high ground more important?

* 4D) HB2 did more than require people to use a facility based on biological sex. It also took away the rights of all North Carolinians to sue over discrimination in state courts. Do you support this part of the bill and why?
