Coral Gables is not located in the 13th Congressional District, where Sink is running.\n\nTickets range from $1,000 to $5,000.\n\nSink is campaigning against Republican nominee David Jolly, who's seen a bevy of outside Republican groups spend money on his behalf.\n\nThe winner will fill the remainder of the late Republican Rep. Bill Young's term, who died in October. Young, who was first elected to Congress in 1970, was the longest serving Republican in the House.\n\nThe 13th district covers most of Pinellas County and parts of St. Petersburg. While Young captured 58% of the vote in his 2012 re-election, President Barack Obama narrowly carried the district. Obama also won it 2008, grabbing 51% support.", "article_metadata": {"description": "(CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden will campaign for the Democratic nominee in a heated House special election in Florida that's widely considered a bellwether race for the 2014 midterms.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Biden to campaign for House candidate in tight Florida race", "og": {"url": "http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/05/biden-to-campaign-for-house-candidate-in-tight-florida-race/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/131017120746-03-joe-biden-1017-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "(CNN) -- Vice President Joe Biden will campaign for the Democratic nominee in a heated House special election in Florida that's widely considered a bellwether race for the 2014 midterms.", "title": "Biden to campaign for House candidate in tight Florida race"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "- All politics, all the time", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Political Ticker", "keywords": "2014, alex sink, florida, joe biden, cnn's ashley killough and paul steinhauser", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0f9a\"", "article_summary": "2 years ago(CNN) - Vice President Joe Biden will campaign for the Democratic nominee in a heated House special election in Florida that's widely considered a bellwether race for the 2014 midterms.\nFollow @politicaltickerThe reception will be held Wednesday at the home of Judy and Michael Adler, two major Democratic donors, in Coral Gables, Florida.\nSink is campaigning against Republican nominee David Jolly, who's seen a bevy of outside Republican groups spend money on his behalf.\nWhile Young captured 58% of the vote in his 2012 re-election, President Barack Obama narrowly carried the district.\nBiden will appear at a fundraising event for Democrat Alex Sink, Florida's former chief financial officer, next week, according to an invitation obtained by CNN."}
