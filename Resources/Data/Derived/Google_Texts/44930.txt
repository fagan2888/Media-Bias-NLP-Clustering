The Statue of Liberty could be photographed wearing two 60-foot bow ties on Halloween Friday as part of a marketing stunt by the founder of Joe Boxer.

The 35-pound bow ties would hang from helicopters in front of the New York City landmark, creating the illusion that Lady Liberty is wearing them, USA Today reported. The stunt marks the launch of menswear brand Nick Graham, a clothing line created by Nicholas Graham, who founded Joe Boxer in the 1980s.

“It’s going to be a big collection, so what better way to launch it than the Statue of Liberty,” Mr. Graham told the newspaper.

The event is set to begin at 8 a.m. and will last for several hours. The helicopters will also travel the Hudson and East River with the two different bow ties, USA Today reported.

“One is black with white dots and one is orange with white dots,” Mr. Graham said.

According to the FAA, the company planning to fly, called Airads, has a waiver to conduct banner tow operations, but still has to get permission from the FAA’s regional office. Airads said the bow tie banners will be flown within the scope of the the FAA regulations, and the company plans to contact the local FAA prior to the event, a local CW affiliate reported.

A spokesperson for the National Parks of New York Harbor told USA Today: “The Park Service is aware that this is something that Nick Graham is planning on doing. We were told it would be taking place 1,000 feet from Liberty Island, which would make it not on our property.”
