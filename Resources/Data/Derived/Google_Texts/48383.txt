A veteran law-enforcement officer who wants to repeal Obamacare has won the Republican nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives.

Mark Donka eked out a 321-vote victory in Tuesday’s GOP primary, where three candidates had to wait until Wednesday for the Associated Press to call the hotly contested race.

Donka took 36 percent of the vote, ahead of Don Russell’s 33 percent and Donald Nolte’s 31 percent.

Donka, who won his party’s nomination for the same office in 2012, will take on Democratic incumbent Rep. Peter Welch, who holds Vermont’s lone seat in the U.S. House.

Donka has vowed to push for reduced federal spending and the repeal of the federal Affordable Care Act. Donka says he’s a pro-life Republican who will oppose amnesty for undocumented immigrants.

Donka won less than 24 percent of the vote against Welch in 2012.
