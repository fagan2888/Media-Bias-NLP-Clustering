They think they can predict these things, but there is a cost \u2013 the cost of life and limb, the cost of freedoms at home because of a war atmosphere.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe conservatives are supposed to be watching the budget \u2013 instead, they\u2019re talking about the merits of getting involved, whether it\u2019s legal, moral, constitutional, whether there\u2019s a consensus internationally.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was one military general who did make the statement that [the others] ought to have made \u2013 this is not going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars, it\u2019s going to cost billions,\u201d said the former Texas congressman known for his skepticism about U.S. military involvement on foreign soil.\n\nEarlier, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Martin Dempsey, advised the administration that aiding the Syrian rebels could cost $500 million a year \u2013 with average monthly costs rising to $1 billion. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel also mentioned potential costs in his testimony before Congress last week. But fiscal concerns haven\u2019t yet gained real traction.\n\nRELATED: STRIKING SYRIA COULD COST $1 BILLION A MONTH\n\n\u201cJust because one cruise missile might cost one-and-a-half million dollars \u2013there are a lot more expenses involved\u201d in any military strike, said Ron Paul. There\u2019s \u201cthe personnel, moving the Navy around, all the other things\u2026 It will be easy [for costs] to go much, much higher.\u201d He compared the difference in costs in the Iraq War: \u201cIt was estimated to cost $60 billion \u2013 and it turned out to be into the trillions.\u201d\n\n\u2018BIN LADEN WANTED THIS\u2019\n\nYet as costly as involvement in Syria could be, even that\u2019s not the real tragedy here, according to Paul.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly what [Osama] Bin Laden expected and wanted to happen,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cHe wanted us to get bogged down in the Middle East \u2013 before he was killed he said he was surprised at how much we did bog ourselves down there. He wanted to bring on a financial crisis in this country. He brought the Soviets down in this manner, by bogging them down in Afghanistan, and finally the Soviet Union collapsed for financial reasons. So unfortunately, I see [the Syrian developments] as very dangerous, and I think the sooner we get ourselves out of the Middle East, the better.\u201d\n\nIs someone working behind Assad on this \u2013 supporting him in some fashion? \u201cMaybe Al Qaeda might be part of his thinking \u2013 who knows.\u201d\n\nPaul noted reports that some Syrian rebel groups have poison gas \u201cand that there was an accident. You don\u2019t know what to believe on that. But I think the gas episode only benefits the rebels and not Assad\u2026 Strategically, it makes no sense for Assad to [attack Syrian civilians] unless it was an accident. He was winning the war. The rebels are on the run, and that\u2019s when all of a sudden something had to change: They needed Americans to come in to solve this problem of Assad staying in power. So it makes a lot of sense for somebody else to have done this on purpose and to blame it on Assad.\u201d\n\nWhat does Paul think of President Obama\u2019s move to ask Congress to authorize a limited strike in Syria?\n\n\u201cIt makes you wonder just where he\u2019s coming from. Maybe he is honestly torn,\u201d said Paul. \u201cAnd maybe he\u2019s being pressured by some very powerful special interests that control our government \u2013 the military industrial complex and others \u2013 to pursue this and not get out of the Middle East. But he just can\u2019t pretend that all of a sudden he wants advice from Congress and the people and that he\u2019s doing this for constitutional reasons. Our presidents don\u2019t care about getting permission \u2013 Republican or Democrat. They just do what they want anyway.\n\n\u201cI do think he\u2019s underestimating the sentiment in this country,\u201d Paul added. \u201cThe American people aren\u2019t capitulating on this. I think it would be a major victory for the American people if they influence Congress and put enough pressure on the members to not vote for this authority. It may create a great dilemma for the president \u2013 but it will be a healthy debate in the right direction. The president just can\u2019t go and expand war without the endorsement of the people.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "There is far too little discussion in Washington about the enormous costs that could come with military against the Syrian government, said Ron Paul, the former Texas congressman and longtime libertarian, in a spirited interview on Friday.", "title": "Why Aren\u2019t We Talking About the Cost of War in Syria?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/08/Ron-Paul-Tremendous-Cost-War-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10182011_Ron_Paul_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/09/08/Ron-Paul-Tremendous-Cost-War-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/10182011_Ron_Paul_article.jpg", "creator": "@maurmack", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "There is far too little discussion in Washington about the enormous costs that could come with military against the Syrian government, said Ron Paul, the former Texas congressman and longtime libertarian, in a spirited interview on Friday.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9dd5\"", "article_summary": "RELATED: STRIKING SYRIA COULD COST $1 BILLION A MONTH\u201cJust because one cruise missile might cost one-and-a-half million dollars \u2013there are a lot more expenses involved\u201d in any military strike, said Ron Paul.\nBoth President Obama and Congress are giving far too little consideration to the potentially huge costs of a U.S. military strike against Syria, according to longtime civil libertarian and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul.\nThe president just can\u2019t go and expand war without the endorsement of the people.\u201d\nIt may create a great dilemma for the president \u2013 but it will be a healthy debate in the right direction.\nSo it makes a lot of sense for somebody else to have done this on purpose and to blame it on Assad.\u201dWhat does Paul think of President Obama\u2019s move to ask Congress to authorize a limited strike in Syria?"}
