Ted Cruz deliver a speech, whether on the Senate floor or on the presidential campaign trail, is that he is a debater at heart. That is to say, his whole style of argument and delivery is meant less to reveal actual truth than to convince listeners that he is right. And if hyperbole and misdirection help the cause, so be it.\n\nIt\u2019s not unlike watching a skilled magician perform on stage. You know he\u2019s going to try to fool you, and part of the fun is trying to figure out how he\u2019s doing it.\n\nRelated: Why Ted Cruz Is Surging in the Polls\n\nHis persuasive talents were on full display Thursday morning, in a speech on national security and defense policy at the Heritage Foundation in Washington. At one point, Cruz used some rhetorical trickery to suggest that statements from the Obama administration \u2013 particularly from Attorney General Loretta Lynch \u2013 might have prevented law enforcement officials from breaking up the terror plot that led to the massacre of 14 innocents in San Bernardino last week by a husband and wife who pledged allegiance to the terror group ISIS.\n\nCruz hit most of his usual talking points in the speech, blasting the Obama administration for failing to refer to ISIS and ISIS-inspired terrorists as \u201cradical Islamic terrorists,\u201d promising more bombing of the terror group and a plan to \u201cdestroy\u201d it. He hammered the administration for what he described as a desire to strip away Americans\u2019 Second Amendment rights by regulating firearms, for what he called a failed effort to destroy ISIS in the Middle East, and more.\n\nIn a campaign dominated by a candidate who doesn\u2019t do nuance particularly well, Cruz was willing to delve into some surprisingly complex subject matter. For example, he argued that the promotion of Democracy abroad ought not to be the goal of the United States in all cases, and said that the country must be ready to work with foreign leaders who don\u2019t share its respect for democratic ideals if doing so can advance U.S. interests.\n\nCruz also said that he doesn\u2019t believe that the U.S. has a \u201cside\u201d in the ongoing civil war in Syria, essentially calling for the U.S. to sit out a conflict that has left hundreds of thousands dead and millions displaced.\n\nRelated: Welcome to the Weird World of Ted Cruz Fan Art\n\nCruz the stage magician, however, made an appearance in his discussion of the Obama administration\u2019s treatment of anti-Muslim rhetoric in the U.S.\n\nAttorney General Lynch recently spoke to a Muslim group in suburban Washington and addressed their concerns about increasingly virulent anti-Muslim rhetoric in the U.S., saying that the Justice Department would \u201ctake action\u201d when such speech \u201cedges toward violence.\u201d\n\nSome reacted with alarm, suggesting that Lynch was saying that the Justice Department would prosecute constitutionally protected speech. On Monday she clarified her position, saying \"We always have a concern when we see the rhetoric rising against any particular group in America, that it might inspire others to violent action \u2014 and that violent action is what we would have to deal with.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, by Thursday, Cruz was warning that the nation may be \u201cfacing the weaponization of one of our own government agencies, deployed not to protect Americans but to force them to submit to the Obama administration\u2019s code of what is and is not acceptable speech.\u201d\n\nRelated: Cruz \u2013 San Bernardino Attack Shows U.S. Is \u2018at War\u2019 with \u2018Radical Islam\u2019\n\nHe continued, \u201cAttorney General Lynch said that\u2019s what she was most afraid of, that we might exercise our First Amendment rights and speak out about this threat. How about having an attorney general who is focused on keeping our children safe rather than muzzling the free speech rights of Americans?\u201d\n\nWatch carefully, because here\u2019s where Cruz makes the jump from garden-variety hyperbole to sneaky misdirection.\n\n\u201cIn fact, we\u2019re already seeing the consequences of fear stifling speech,\u201d he said ominously. Bringing up the San Bernardino attacks again, he said, \u201cThe neighbors reportedly found their behavior odd. But until now they didn\u2019t say anything to law enforcement because they were scared they would be accused of racial profiling.\n\n\u201cImagine how different San Bernardino would have played out if the fear and political correctness had not silenced the neighbors. If a phone call had been made. If law enforcement had investigated, if they had discovered the abundant evidence of radicalization and intent to wage jihad, and if these two had been apprehended before they went on a murderous spree.\n\nRelated: The West Can Defeat ISIS \u2013 But What Comes Next?\n\n\u201cLoretta Lynch\u2019s ban on what she calls anti-Muslim rhetoric is already producing its chilling effect, and it\u2019s preventing Americans from taking basic steps to protect ourselves.\u201d\n\nNow here\u2019s the thing. Everything Cruz quoted Lynch as saying, she said after the San Bernardino attacks. Even if she had issued a \u201cban\u201d on anti-Muslim rhetoric -- which she didn\u2019t -- it couldn\u2019t have affected the thinking of the killers\u2019 neighbors prior to the attack, absent the existence of a time machine. However, by the time any of that registered with the more critical members of the audience, Cruz had moved along to his next point, his unsupported charge against Lynch firmly planted in his listeners\u2019 memories.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to like Ted Cruz, and comments to the media by his former colleagues and classmates suggest that an awful lot of people don\u2019t. But give credit where it\u2019s due: He\u2019s a skilled showman.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Watching ted Cruz give a speech is like watching a skilled magician perform on stage.
