The retired neurosurgeon issued a Facebook apology in early March after he said that people come out of jail gay, and now he has likened President Barack Obama to a psychopath.\n\nIn an article by Jason Zengerle in the April issue of GQ titled \u201cWhat If Sarah Palin Were a Brain Surgeon,\u201d the presidential hopeful rants about Nazis and claims the leader of America is a lunatic while discussing one of Obama\u2019s speeches with Armstrong Williams, Carson\u2019s business manager and unofficial political adviser.\n\nVia GQ:\n\n\u201cHe looks good,\u201d Williams said. \"He looks clean. Shirt\u2019s white. The tie. He looks elegant.\u201d \u201cLike most psychopaths,\" Carson grumbled. \"That\u2019s why they\u2019re successful. That\u2019s the way they look. They all look great.\u201d Continue Reading Below\n\nBut when Williams seemingly defends the leader of the free world, Carson does not relent:\n\n\u201cHe faces the same challenges you will face,\" Williams said of Obama as he spoke. \u201cHe\u2019s gotta convince people to believe him. That\u2019s all he\u2019s doing: selling his narrative.\u201d \u201cBut he knows he\u2019s telling a lie!\" Carson vented. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to sell what he thinks is not true! He\u2019s sitting there saying, \u2018These Americans are so stupid I can tell them anything.\u2019 \"\n\nCarson compared the U.S. to Nazi Germany while he was at Jerusalem\u2019s Holocaust museum last year, the GQ article explains. Though Zengerle tries to convince Carson he was \u201cout of line\u201d when he said Americans under Obama are as afraid to criticize their government as Germans were under the Third Reich, the retired neurosurgeon stands by the analogy.\n\nCarson has not issued a statement since his recent statements went viral. Instead, his latest Facebook post was about the anniversary of Obamacare -- something he has said is worse than slavery. \" 'Happy\u2019 Anniversary, Obamacare. Despite the White House spin, Obamacare is clearly not a success,\u201d he wrote in an edited post Monday.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @mariamzzarella", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ben carson likens barack obama to a psychopath, compares america to 'nazi germany' ben carson, will ben carson run for president 2016?, ben carson facebook 2015", "og": {"site_name": "International Business Times", "description": "\u201cLike most psychopaths,\" Carson grumbled. \"That\u2019s why they\u2019re successful.
