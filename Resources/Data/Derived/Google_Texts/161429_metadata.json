While the group\u2019s spending in Senate races has attracted national attention, it\u2019s these less noticed field efforts that could have greater impact and help reshape the Republican Party heading into the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe organization has more than 500 paid workers in 35 states and has become one of the conservative movement\u2019s best organized, most powerful outside groups. Building on the community-based approach President Barack Obama used successfully in 2008 and 2012, it now has a political footprint unmatched among GOP-affiliated operations.\n\nCHALKING UP VICTORIES\n\nIt\u2019s racking up legislative victories, too. The group scuttled efforts to raise taxes to build a downtown campus for the well-regarded zoo in Columbus, Ohio, and derailed plans in Florida\u2019s Legislature to subsidize improvements to the Miami Dolphins\u2019 football stadium. It helped fend off a recall effort against Gov. Scott Walker, R-Wis., and pushed pro-business workplace laws in Michigan and Indiana.\n\nIt didn\u2019t shy away from going after traditional allies, as was the case when Gov. Rick Scott, R-Fla., briefly considered expanding Medicaid, a core component of Obama\u2019s health care law. Americans for Prosperity mobilized supporters, the Republican-led Legislature quickly rejected the idea and Scott dropped his proposal.\n\nTim Phillips, the group\u2019s president, said Americans for Prosperity had helped usher in \u201ca once-in-a-generation renaissance for economic freedom policies,\u201d and was poised to keep financial issues prominent in 2016.\n\n\u201cFor the first time, we have the infrastructure on our side to sustain these policy battles,\u201d he said.\n\nThis fall, Americans for Prosperity is campaigning against a sales tax increase in South Carolina\u2019s Greenville County, as well as trying to elect conservatives to office. Unlike what it has done for most of this year, the group now is engaging in explicitly political messages for the campaign\u2019s final weeks.\n\nPotential presidential contenders have taken notice.\n\nGOP Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas spoke at the group\u2019s annual summit in August. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., headlined the Koch brothers\u2019 seminar for major conservative donors this year.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity sprang up in 2004 but has gained heft during the past two election cycles. Its budget has grown from less than $3 million in 2004 to more than $130 million for the 2012 election cycle.\n\nIn many places, the group has more trained and paid operatives than the traditional political parties have. Nowhere is this more obvious than Florida, where the group has 10 offices, its single largest field operation.\n\nIn the group\u2019s Orlando outpost, Phillips recently met with 15 volunteers who were wearing bright green T-shirts with Americans for Prosperity\u2019s torch logo.\n\nUsing iPads, they had spent the morning asking voters to take an issues survey that included the federal health law, government spending and taxes. The information helps them develop messages and test which arguments resonate with voters.\n\nIT\u2019S ALL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS\n\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean always knocking on the door and telling people \u2018Obamacare\u2019 is bad,\u201d Phillips told the volunteers. \u201cThat\u2019s important, but the goal is to bring some good and build relationships over the long term.\u201d\n\nThat strategy has become central to the Koch network of organizations. This year, they are trying to help Republicans pick up the six seats they need to win control of the Senate \u2013 Americans for Prosperity spent $25 million on TV ads alone \u2013 but it is not what drives the organization.\n\n\u201cPeople say our biggest goal is a Republican Senate. Not true,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cFlorida is our biggest imprint.\u201d\n\nAs the Nov. 4 vote nears, it\u2019s all about voter-to-voter contacts, relationships that could pay dividends in 2016 and beyond.\n\nThat means sending hundreds of staff and volunteers into neighborhoods, like the one in Miami packed with pastel homes with Spanish-tile roofs.\n\nMalave, the group\u2019s Hispanic outreach chief in Florida, spent more than three hours knocking on doors in the scorching sun on a recent Tuesday. He kept asking the questions and punching in the answers on his iPad so leaders at headquarters could figure out which messages were working.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t glamorous work,\u201d Malave said, sweating through a polo shirt. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got to go where the folks are. People aren\u2019t going to come to you.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity has thousands of boots on the ground across the U.S.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity has thousands of boots on the ground across the U.S.", "title": "Conservatives flock to engage voters - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1000, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/517722_Koch-Brothers-2016-Planni3.jpg", "height": 592}, "updated_time": "2014-10-11T20:22:33-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/10/12/conservatives-flock-to-engage-voters/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity has thousands of boots on the ground across the U.S.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/517722_Koch-Brothers-2016-Planni3.jpg", "title": "Conservatives flock to engage voters - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Nation & World", "published_time": "2014-10-12T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-11T20:22:33-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "They are the backbone of Americans for Prosperity, the flagship organization of the political network backed by industrialist billionaires Charles and David Koch.\nAmericans for Prosperity mobilized supporters, the Republican-led Legislature quickly rejected the idea and Scott dropped his proposal.\nAmericans for Prosperity sprang up in 2004 but has gained heft during the past two election cycles.\nIT\u2019S ALL ABOUT RELATIONSHIPS\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean always knocking on the door and telling people \u2018Obamacare\u2019 is bad,\u201d Phillips told the volunteers.\nIn the group\u2019s Orlando outpost, Phillips recently met with 15 volunteers who were wearing bright green T-shirts with Americans for Prosperity\u2019s torch logo."}
