Together with then-U.S. CIO Vivek Kundra, the two focused efforts on making government more transparent with the Open Government Initiative.\n\nChopra's departure from the federal government in 2012 brought him back to Virginia, where he served as the state\u2019s technology officer before joining the Obama administration. Chopra threw his hat into the political ring by running for Virginia lieutenant governor during the June primaries, but lost to eventual Democratic nominee Ralph Northam.\n\nBut losing an election hasn\u2019t stopped Chopra from staying involved in government. He recently joined API management and strategy company Apigee where he serves on its advisory board.\n\nChopra, a longtime advocate of open data in the public sector, said API development is a key digital strategy in unlocking government data, and will be instrumental in the development of new products and services that both advance the mission of the agency whose data is being released, but also grow the economy and create new jobs.\n\nSam Ramji, vice president of strategy at Apigee, said that because APIs allow for access to data through multiple methods, it provides an \u201cand\u201d factor. Users can access data from a portal, mobile devices and kiosks.\n\nHowever, the progression of APIs will in no way replace the use of government portals for accessing data, Chopra said. It simply provides another outlet for accessing that same data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an either/or by any means,\u201d Chopra said. \u201cThere is no wrong door to access government data.\u201d\n\nSo far, API integration with government portals has already proved successful, for example, with HealthCare.gov, Chopra said. The portal, launched in 2010, is considered a first-of-its-kind guide to choosing health insurance information. Shortly after an API was released for the federal portal, data from the site was harnessed and provided on other websites so users could seek insurance information. Although it\u2019s the same data from HealthCare.gov, it was presented to users outside of the site with the assistance of APIs.\n\nDuring the website\u2019s development, overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' former CTO Todd Park (who now coincidentally fills Chopra\u2019s former position as U.S. CTO), the intention was that 90 percent of Americans using data provided on HeathCare.gov would not do so by going directly to the platform.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about data consumability,\" Ramji said. \u201cThat means starting with simplicity and ending with scale \u2013 that\u2019s the big progression. The progression from what we call data in files on a server versus data that is live and almost effervescent coming out of an API \u2013 very consumable, very easy to tap.\u201d\n\nAPIs and the Affordable Healthcare Act\n\nThe Oct. 1 deadline is fast approaching for the federal government\u2019s mandated Health Insurance Marketplace to launch, an online application where users can view different health-care options and enroll in an insurance plan. But with the looming deadline just a week away, the marketplace, to be supported on HealthCare.gov, does not yet have its own API.\n\nDuring Chopra\u2019s tenure as federal CTO, he helped draft the technical standards for the Affordable Care Act, the legislation connected to the marketplace. In those standards, Chopra advanced the idea that over time, the marketplace should have its own APIs.\n\n\u201cMy instinct is that within the next year or two [the HealthCare.gov Marketplace] will be one more example of an application that has APIs,\u201d Chopra said.", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "Aneesh Chopra, the first-ever federal CTO, says the evolution of application programming interfaces (APIs) will continue to open up government data in accessible, machine-readable formats.", "pubDate": "2013-09-23", "og": {"image": "http://media2.govtech.com/images/Aneesh_flickr.jpg", "title": "Former U.S. CTO Says APIs Are Key to Unlocking Government Data"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/data", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "Data", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b23\"", "article_summary": "However, the progression of APIs will in no way replace the use of government portals for accessing data, Chopra said.\n\u201cMy instinct is that within the next year or two [the HealthCare.gov Marketplace] will be one more example of an application that has APIs,\u201d Chopra said.\nDuring Chopra\u2019s tenure as federal CTO, he helped draft the technical standards for the Affordable Care Act, the legislation connected to the marketplace.\nAlthough it\u2019s the same data from HealthCare.gov, it was presented to users outside of the site with the assistance of APIs.\nChopra was the first-ever federal CTO, appointed by President Barack Obama in 2009."}
