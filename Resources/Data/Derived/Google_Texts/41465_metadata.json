Getty Images\n\nAnother day, another media company unveiling a plan to offer creative services to brands. It\u2019s a trend that threatens to squeeze ad agencies that normally dream up campaigns for advertisers.\n\niHeartMedia Inc., the radio giant which last year changed its name from Clear Channel, will on Tuesday announce a new branded content studio. The program, called \u201ciHeartMedia Soundboard,\u201d will offer to marketers the kind of opportunities they have come to expect in other sectors of the media industry \u2014 partnerships with publishers to fashion ads that blend alongside editorial work.\n\nCompanies from BuzzFeed to The Wall Street Journal to the New York Times have set up walled-off studios that create articles marked as \u201csponsored\u201d on behalf of brands.\n\nCond\u00e9 Nast took things a step further last week when it announced a new program that will enlist its editors to work directly on branded content, breaking down the traditional barrier between the business and editorial operations inside media companies.\n\nOf course, radio is an entirely different medium from Web publishing. Branded audio is a newer form.\n\n\u201cBranded content has become a big growth area for brands,\u201d said Gayle Troberman, chief marketing officer at iHeartMedia. \u201cThey want to tell richer stories, be connected to content. They don\u2019t want to interrupt.\u201d\n\nMs. Troberman says iHeartMedia \u2014 whose businesses include traditional terrestrial radio, a digital radio service and big-ticket live events \u2014 plans to work with marketers to create interview-based shows and both short and long-form \u201cnarrative\u201d pieces.\n\niHeartMedia anticipates the early offering will consist mostly of short audio clips that tease full episodes available online or in an app.\n\nThe company plans to make available stars like Jared Leto, Ryan Seacrest and Steve Harvey. iHeartMedia hasn\u2019t signed up any brands yet, though it plans to dedicate a \u201csmall core creative team\u201d to focus solely on the new studio. The company says it will initially focus on signing on its largest advertising clients.\n\nOther media companies in the radio space also offer creative services. Streaming music company Pandora Inc. now has just over 60 employees in its creative division and has worked with Toyota and its ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi, for example, to make \u201cToyota Sessions,\u201d a custom station on Pandora that features behind-the-scenes artist interviews.\n\nBy offering an in-house service, Pandora says it can deliver fast results to brands by \u201cbalancing the creative output with what we can possibly achieve technically,\u201d said Tony Calzaretta, vice president of design and creative at Pandora.\n\nBoth iHeartMedia and Pandora say they are comfortable working alongside traditional agencies when thinking up branded content.\n\nBrands\u2019 willingness to work directly with media companies has stoked fears in the agency world for some time now. Three, the thought goes, may be a crowd.\n\n\u201cIs it a threat to an agency that iHeart would be a resource for clients and that a client could go directly to iHeart instead of the agency? I\u2019m sure that\u2019s a risk,\u201d said Matt Seiler, chief executive of media buyer IPG Mediabrands. \u201cBut I\u2019ve always believed that each of us has to be the very best at what we do because there\u2019s always been competition.\u201d\n\niHeartMedia\u2019s announcement comes as some brands take another look at audio thanks in part to successful podcasts like \u201cSerial,\u201d a \u201cThis American Life\u201d murder mystery spin-off that quickly inspired cult-like obsession online. MailChimp, the email marketing company that advertised during the show with a strange pre-roll message, became something of a character itself during the Internet\u2019s ongoing fascination with the program.\n\nMr. Seiler said radio has indeed become a more attractive place for advertising, largely because it\u2019s a place to grab prized live audiences.\n\n\u201cThe genius of radio is that it\u2019s about the here and now,\u201d Mr. Seiler said. \u201cYou can\u2019t skip past radio.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "title": "iHeartMedia Launches Branded Content Studio", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/02/03/iheartmedia-launches-branded-content-studio/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GI131_0107ta_P_20150107173759.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "iHeartMedia Launches Branded Content Studio", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Steven Perlberg", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CMO Today Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "CMO Today", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-02-03T14:30:32-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-157", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/02/03/iheartmedia-launches-branded-content-studio/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-269B-2680", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "CSuite", "language": "en-US", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/02/03/iheartmedia-launches-branded-content-studio/", "site_name": "WSJ", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GI131_0107ta_P_20150107173759.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article", "title": "iHeartMedia Launches Branded Content Studio"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "CMO Today", "article.id": "BL-269B-2680", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-02-03T15:33:18-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc8b8\"", "article_summary": "iHeartMedia Inc., the radio giant which last year changed its name from Clear Channel, will on Tuesday announce a new branded content studio.\nBoth iHeartMedia and Pandora say they are comfortable working alongside traditional agencies when thinking up branded content.\n\u201cBranded content has become a big growth area for brands,\u201d said Gayle Troberman, chief marketing officer at iHeartMedia.\niHeartMedia hasn\u2019t signed up any brands yet, though it plans to dedicate a \u201csmall core creative team\u201d to focus solely on the new studio.\nGetty ImagesAnother day, another media company unveiling a plan to offer creative services to brands."}
