SK Capital Grabs Stake in Halo Pharmaceutical

The target provides outsourced pharmaceutical manufacturing services, which pharma companies often rely on so they can focus on drug development

SK Capital Partners has acquired a majority stake in Halo Pharmaceutical for an undisclosed amount.

Halo, headquartered in Whippany, New Jersey, provides outsourced development and manufacturing services to the pharmaceutical industry. The company makes solid, semi-solid and liquid medicines, with a particular focus on controlled substances.

SK Capital, a New York private equity firm, expects the investment to help Halo grow organically and through acquisitions. The firm closed a $1 billion fund in December. Before that, in October, SK portfolio company Anchroma agreed to buy the textile operations of BASF SE (FRA: BAS).

Many pharmaceutical companies have looked to outsource manufacturing as they focus more on drug development. For more on pharmaceutical manufacturing, see Pursuing Pharmaceutical Manufacturing.
