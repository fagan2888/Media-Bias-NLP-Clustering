No luck. I made it through four pages yesterday \u2014 then got a message saying I\u2019d have to wait because there was too much traffic. When I clicked the continue button, it wiped out the information I had typed into the first three pages.\n\nBut even if I do get onto the exchanges, it\u2019s probably not going to matter.\n\nI read in a newspaper that Highmark is the only health insurance company on the exchange in West Virginia. Yesterday, I called Highmark and spent an hour on the phone with a nice young man \u2014 but the results were not good. The skimpiest plan is going to cost me more than I\u2019m paying now for a higher deductible and out of pocket result.\n\nThank you Obamacare.\n\nMy insurance agent told me yesterday I had only one alternative \u2014 wait for six years until Medicare kicks in and keep fighting for single payer.\n\nObviously, the Democrats and anyone who defends them are not going to be of any help in the next round. They are irrevocably tied to President Obama and Obamacare and even those Democrats nominally in favor of single payer refuse to criticize it for the industry written law that it is.\n\nI agree with Dr. Quentin Young of Physicians for a National Health Program when he says that Obamacare should have been defeated because it enshrines and solidifies corporate domination of the health care system.\n\nBut what to do next? Well, first thing is to watch a movie called Healthcare \u2014 The Movie. It\u2019s a short documentary \u2014 62 minutes \u2014 but packs a big punch. The movie was produced by a husband wife team \u2014 the wife Canadian \u2014 Laurie Simons \u2014 and the husband American \u2014 Terry Sterrenberg.\n\nThe movie toggles back and forth between the USA and Canada \u2014 with Americans struggling with bankruptcy, death from lack of health insurance and the dark cloud of health insurance armageddon menacing their lives from cradle to an often early grave.\n\nThe Canadians, by contrast, are living in a relative health care nirvana, thanks in large part to Tommy Douglas, a boxer and Premier of Saskatchewan who stood up to the red baiting being dished out at the time by the Canadian medical establishment. Douglas emerged victorious and his efforts resulted in the creation of Canada\u2019s single payer Medicare for all. The movie is narrated by actor Kiefer Sutherland \u2014 Tommy Douglas\u2019 grandson.\n\nThe film features great historic clips \u2014 including a remarkable scene where a CBC television show host asks the question \u2014 who is the greatest Canadian? And then, in reality show format, puts it up to a vote.\n\n\u201cAfter six weeks, ten finalists, and more than a million votes,\u201d the CBC host says, \u201cit ended tonight with one name . And I have the envelope here. The greatest Canadian as decided by you is \u2014 Tommy Douglas.\u201d\n\nImagine that \u2014 the country says that Tommy Douglas, the father of single payer in Canada, is greater than its greatest hockey player \u2014 Wayne Gretzky.\n\nTommy Douglas\u2019 courageous act \u2014 standing up for the people of Canada against the vicious attacks of the powers that be \u2014 has resulted in a system that delivers health care for all Canadians \u2014 no complex bills, no deductibles, no deaths from lack of health insurance, no medical bankruptcies \u2014 all funded by a progressive tax system.\n\nThe movie profiles Canadians with serious medical illness \u2014 who come out financially unscathed \u2014 no bills, no bankruptcy, no health related financial worries.\n\nAnd then compares those Canadians to the suffering human beings south of the border.\n\nThe movie does a good job of making us Americans feel like crap compared to our cousins up north.\n\nCheck out this sequence, for example:\n\nHow many people in the United States die each year because they have no health insurance?\n\n45,000\n\nHow many people in Canada die each year because they have no health insurance?\n\nZero.\n\nHow many people go bankrupt each year in the United States because of medical expenses?\n\n922,819\n\nHow many people go bankrupt each year in Canada because of medical expenses?\n\nZero.\n\nHow many Americans do not have health insurance?\n\n50 million.\n\nHow many Canadians do not have health insurance?\n\nZero.\n\nHow many Americans go without medical care because of costs?\n\n115 million.\n\nHow many Canadians go without medical care because of costs?\n\nZero.\n\nOne of the stars of this film is a young American from Portland, Oregon named Lindsay Caron.\n\n\u201cI was a free-lance artist for a long time,\u201d Caron says. \u201cI gave that up to go sit in an office and file papers so that I could have health care. And it amazed me that other people in other countries never had to think about that. I kept hearing that Canada\u2019s system was broken, and that Canadians were flocking over the border to get US care. And so I wanted to go to Canada with a camera and ask a couple hundred people. I bought a ticket up to Vancouver, Canada. I rented camera equipment. And I took my bicycle. I thought maybe I would stay in Vancouver for a couple of days and cycle on back to Portland. I ended staying there the whole week. I got up in the morning, set up a camera on the street and just start asking people questions.\u201d\n\nCaron finds out what polls in Canada consistently confirm \u2014 that the vast majority of Canadians would never in a thousand years give up their Medicare coverage for the nightmare south of the border.\n\nIt all came about because Tommy Douglas had the guts to stand up to the political and medical establishment and do what is right for the Canadian people.\n\nCanada did it.\n\nThere is no reason we can\u2019t do it.\n\nIt\u2019s simply a matter of reordering our priorities.\n\nLet\u2019s put aside, for a moment, our millions of copies of Grand Theft Auto 5 and start playing a new game \u2014 Grand Theft \u2014 Health Insurance.\n\nThe goal of the game is to become a boxer, like Tommy Douglas \u2014 and fight back against the insurance industry and its Frankenstein monster \u2014 Obamacare.\n\nRepeal Obamacare.\n\nReplace it with single payer.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 3.8.14", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd80bd\"", "article_summary": "I read in a newspaper that Highmark is the only health insurance company on the exchange in West Virginia.\nThat\u2019s when my health insurance policy expires and I have a decision to make \u2014 renew or not renew?\n\u201cI gave that up to go sit in an office and file papers so that I could have health care.\nMy health insurance company informed me yesterday that my premium will doubled to $14,000 on January 1.\nThe movie is narrated by actor Kiefer Sutherland \u2014 Tommy Douglas\u2019 grandson."}
