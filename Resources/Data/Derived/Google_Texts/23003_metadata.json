Although the vast majority of such services are paid out of pocket, there are some exceptions and signs of change for the future.\n\n\u201cI know that there is a trend in that direction, when you\u2019re talking about integrative medicine and a doctor who agrees that your mind, body and spirit all need to be treated at the same time,\u201d says Myrna Harris, chief executive officer of Crescent Health Solutions in Asheville, a health-plan administrator for employers and several thousand employees in Western North Carolina and Oklahoma. \u201cI think we are more aware of those things and that more is being done in those areas than ever before.\u201d\n\nBut she sees two main reasons why there has not been more progress. \u201cThere is not enough data out there to support whether one of these integrative methods is effective enough. \u2026 When insurance companies or employers go to pay for something that is related to your health care, they would like to know that the literature is out there to support what is being done, that it has some efficacy,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cBut then I believe that employers and health care have been so caught up in the confusion of what we\u2019re required to do because of the Affordable Care Act, there has not been as much focus on integrative medicine as maybe there would have been.\u201d\n\nThe ACA, for many people, means the procurement of basic health care. \u201cMost people want a ticket to dance. That means they want to be able to get into a hospital if they need it and have peace of mind around basic care like annual exams,\u201d says John Daly, owner of Insurance Value Management, an Affordable Care Act broker. If a person is healthy, he says, \u201cI recommend that person into a high deductible [plan] so they minimize their premium.\u201d\n\nThis strategy enables people to better afford services out of pocket.\n\nIn order to provide more coverage for integrative services, some employers have what is called a self-funded or partially funded insurance plan, whereas the big insurers \u2014 like Blue Cross Blue Shield and Aetna \u2014 have preset service menus and don\u2019t include integrative services, says Harris.\n\nMission Health, for example, covers acupuncture for its employees through their self funded plan. \u201cI think as a health system we have always seen the value of complementary therapies,\u201d says Anna Walz, director of system wellness at Mission. \u201cCertainly over the past few years it\u2019s been more of a focus, and there\u2019s more data in this area,\u201d she says, referring to the growing scientific evidence supporting integrative therapies.\n\nMission employees have access to on-site massage, acupuncture, yoga and Zumba classes as a part of their My Healthy Life employee program. Interest in the program has been so strong that this March, it\u2019s moving into a new facility, which will also be open to the public. \u201cThe goal [of the new location] is to create a peaceful, spa-like place for employees and the public to receive services. We want to work with people to prevent them becoming patients,\u201d Walz says with a chuckle.\n\nBut even with the discounts Mission employees receive, a good portion of the fee for these services still comes out of pocket. One way to help make these costs easier is a tax-deferred bank account.\n\n\u201cSome employers offer flexible savings accounts,\u201d explains Harris. \u201cWhat this means is that employees can, for example, take $50 out of their paycheck every two weeks and put it into a flexible savings account. This is pretax money. They can then use those dollars to pay for certain things, like co-pays for doctors and medication,\u201d she says.\n\nThe rules on what this money can be used for differ from plan to plan. At Crescent, which has the option of flexible savings accounts, you do not need a doctor\u2019s prescription for acupuncture, but you do need one for massage, she explains.\n\nAnother option is a health savings account. \u201cThese are essentially a slush fund that you put in a participating bank. It is so much money per year that is tax-deferred, so you\u2019re not paying taxes on it,\u201d says Daly. Health savings accounts can be used \u201con any health services not covered by your plan until you meet your deductible,\u201d says Daly.\n\nHealth savings account funds can used for any integrative and preventive care service.\n\nIn addition, many Asheville integrative and holistic health care providers go out of their way to design fee structures that are accessible. \u201cThe most progressive thing I\u2019ve seen here in Asheville is a $40 [per] month deal,\u201d says Daly.\n\nHe is referring to Integrative Family Medicine of Asheville\u2019s Integrative Living Program. For $40 a month, a patient receives a number of benefits, including an annual physical exam, unlimited visits for a $20 co-pay, $30 discount on all procedures, and standard labs at no cost.\n\n\u201cThe average physician spends $80,000 a year to interface with insurance,\u201d says Brian Lewis, one of the founding physicians at the practice. \u201cWe looked for a way to set up primary care that is affordable for people.\u201d\n\nSo Integrative Family Medicine settled on the flat monthly fee structure, a feature of an emerging financial model called direct primary care. \u201cIt takes the barrier away to spending time with a provider,\u201d says Lewis.\n\nEven though most integrative care, tax-deferred or not, is out of pocket, many people find a way to afford it. \u201cI see a significant number of people who don\u2019t make a ton of money, because they see the value,\u201d says Nancy Hyton, a licensed acupuncturist and owner of Center for Holistic Medicine. \u201cI have people [come here] who work at gas stations, wait tables. West Asheville is not a wealthy neighborhood, but we\u2019ve been here eight years, and that\u2019s really the core of people who come to see us, people in the neighborhood. They\u2019re not loaded, but they think it\u2019s worth it, they feel better, they get results,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cAnd more and more [acupuncture and massage] is being prescribed. If your doctor prescribes it, it might be covered by insurance. A lot of people don\u2019t know that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to say,\u201d says Lewis when asked what\u2019s in the future for insurance coverage for integrative medicine. He looks at trends. One is the growing amount of science supporting the efficacy of these approaches, he says. Another is the possibility of the creation of a specialty in integrative medicine, which would enable integrative medicine doctors to be covered under most insurance plans.\n\nHarris sees a wider picture. The big question for her? \u201cCan insurance cover [these services], and if so how much, versus how much does the employee and individual take on? I believe as individuals we need to begin to take more responsibility for our health and well-being. And that means we have to have more skin in the game, if we can afford it.\u201d\n\nAnd although Harris knows that some people cannot even afford copays, for those who can, \u201cWe need to be able to do something ourselves\u201d she says, \u201cso that it is not just all handed to us. When we have some investment in what we\u2019re doing, I think that motivates us.\u201d\n\nMORE INFO\n\nMyrna Harris, crescenths.com or 670-9145\n\nJohn Daly, insurancevaluemanagement.com or 808-2584\n\nAnn Walz, mission-health.org or 213-1111\n\nDr. Brian Lewis, integrativeasheville.org or 575-9600\n\nNancy Hyton, centerholistic.com or 505-3174", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you seek nontraditional health care, such as integrative or complementary approaches, does insurance cover it?
