Pair Obamacare with Jordans.\n\nRecruiters are showing up to places where young residents \u201cparty by night and shop by day,\u201d which in D.C. means lining up at the Footlocker for the release of the Jordan \u201cTaxi\u201d sneakers and a popular hang out restaurant and touting Obamacare.\n\nOfficials on Saturday visited two Footlocker stores where Nike\u2019s exclusive Air Jordan 12 \u201cTaxi\u201d sneakers were going on sale. And they are scheduled to visit two Denny\u2019s restaurants from 2 a.m. to 4 p.m. Sunday. \u201cMy motto is \u2018Get them health care while you get them Jordans,\u201d DC Health Links representative Vanessa Brooks told Fox News outside a Footlocker in the city\u2019s downtown. \u201cGet some health care to go along with them taxis, OK?\u201d Brooks told those at the store. \u201cYou got to have it. And you need it.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has been tenacious in building support around the Affordable Care Act and are working hard to ensure that young people get covered.\n\nAnd if sneakers are the way to go\u2026so be it. Hey, whatever it takes to get all Americans covered, right?\n\nSOURCE: FOX | PHOTO CREDIT: Getty", "article_metadata": {"pubexchange": {"headline": "Calling All Sneakerheads!
