Two people were killed in an Amtrak crash near Philadelphia today, the Chester Fire Department told ABC News.

Seventeen others were injured, including one seriously, the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency said.

Amtrak said the train partially derailed after striking a backhoe that was on the tracks.

The train struck the backhoe in Chester, Pennsylvania -- approximately 15 miles outside of Philadelphia -- and came to a stop in the neighboring town of Trainer, the fire department said.

Amtrak Train 89 had 341 passengers and seven crew members on board at the time and was traveling from New York to Savannah, Georgia.

Passenger Ari Neâ€™eman, who was sitting in the second car, told ABC News the train got "extremely bumpy" and at one point the window in the aisle across from him "started to break apart."

He said it appeared that many injuries were in the first car. Ne'eman said most passengers were fine and that they were being moved to a local church.

Amtrak said its Northeast Corridor service between Wilmington and Philadelphia is suspended until early this afternoon. Keystone Service between New York and Harrisburg is not affected, Amtrak said.

Federal Railroad Administration officials are at the scene. The National Transportation Safety Board was notified and is planning to send a team.

The derailment comes less than a month after an Amtrak train derailed in Kansas while headed from Chicago to Los Angeles, leaving 32 people injured.
