(WWBT/NBC NewsChannel) Chen Thai has only been Steve Dodges's hair stylist for about a year, but in that time the two have become very close. Maybe it's because Chen helped save his life.

"She looked at my scalp as she always does, and said, 'I noticed something here that looks a little different. You have a mole that's asymmetrical. The color looks a little suspicious to me," Dodge said.

Little did Dodge know Thai had been monitoring the mole for several months. She said the mole changed very quickly, which is why she urged him to see a doctor.
