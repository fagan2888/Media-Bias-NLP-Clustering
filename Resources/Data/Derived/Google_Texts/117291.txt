Dr. Ben Carson said on Sunday that he would make a formal announcement by May about a possible 2016 presidential run.

Asked by "Fox News Sunday" host Chris Wallace whether he would set up an exploratory committee in the next few weeks and make an announcement by May, Carson said he thought that "sounded like a reasonable timeframe. Absolutely."

When Wallace tried to press Carson on whether he would definitely announce that he was running for president in the spring, the former neurosurgeon became a little more ambiguous.

"Well, I'm a very careful person," Carson said, "so I want to be careful to make sure that I have all of the infrastructure in place if I make such an announcement to tell you all the questions you're going to be asking in terms of personnel and rationale.

"So we're putting all of that together, yes," Carson added.

Carson apologized last month after it was revealed that he plagarized portions of his book, and said that he was working with editors to rectify the situation. He has also stood by his comparisons of the United States to Nazi Germany and the Affordable Care Act to slavery.

According to HuffPost Pollster, which tracks publicly available opinion polls, Carson is currently near the top of the pack of potential GOP presidential candidates.
