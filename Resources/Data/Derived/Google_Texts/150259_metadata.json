He was eligible for salary arbitration, and those figures were set to be exchanged on Friday. He was coming off a two-year, $19 million deal.\n\nGeneral manager Ned Colletti said last week that both sides had been negotiating.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our desire to sign him here for a very long time,\u201d Colletti said.\n\nThe average salary of $30.7 million tops the previous high of $27.5 million, set by the New York Yankees\u2019 Alex Rodriguez as part of a 10-year agreement December 2007. While Roger Clemens had a contract with a listed salary of $28 million with the Yankees in 2007, he joined the team in June and actually made $17.4 million.\n\nThe Dodgers had baseball\u2019s second-highest payroll at the end of the regular season last fall \u2014 more than $236 million.\n\nKershaw\u2019s agreement, first reported by ESPN.com, is baseball\u2019s seventh of $200 million or more. Among current contracts, it trails only the agreements of Rodriguez, Cincinnati first baseman Joey Votto ($251.5 million over 12 years), Los Angeles Angels first baseman Albert Pujols ($240 million over 10 years) and Seattle second baseman Robinson Cano ($240 million over 10 years).\n\nA left-hander who turns 26 in March, Kershaw won NL Cy Young Awards in 2011 and 2013. He was 16-9 for the NL West champion Dodgers last year and led the league with 232 strikeouts, and his 1.83 ERA was the best in the major leagues since Pedro Martinez\u2019s 1.74 for Boston in 2000. He has led the NL in ERA in each of the last three years.\n\nKershaw has been a powerful, yet low-key, presence on the team. In the offseason, the Dallas native has worked to build a charitable legacy alongside his wife, Ellen. The couple has made yearly trips to Africa, where his foundation that focuses on helping at-risk children built an orphanage.\n\nThe deal signifies further stability for a club that was in turmoil under former owner Frank McCourt, who sold the team to a group that includes Magic Johnson in 2012. The Dodgers signed manager Don Mattingly to a three-year deal last week and now have locked up their ace.\n\nLast year, Kershaw pitched a career-high 259 innings between the regular season and the playoffs. The season ended on a sour note when he pitched a rare clunker in the Dodgers\u2018 9-0 loss to St. Louis in the NL championship series that eliminated them.\n\nStill up for discussion this winter is a new deal for Hanley Ramirez, who hit a team-leading .345 and played hurt during the NLCS. He has one year left on his contract.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kershaw receives the most lucrative deal for a pitcher, breaking the mark of $180 million set by Justin Verlander last March for his seven-year contract with Detroit.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Kershaw receives the most lucrative deal for a pitcher, breaking the mark of $180 million set by Justin Verlander last March for his seven-year contract with Detroit.", "title": "Clayton Kershaw gets new $215 million deal from Dodgers", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/15/clayton-kershaw-gets-new-215-million-deal-dodgers/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/03/nlds-dodgers-braves-baseballjpeg-068d4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/10/03/nlds-dodgers-braves-baseballjpeg-068d4.jpg", "description": "Kershaw receives the most lucrative deal for a pitcher, breaking the mark of $180 million set by Justin Verlander last March for his seven-year contract with Detroit.", "card": "summary", "title": "Clayton Kershaw gets new $215 million deal from Dodgers"}, "Author": "Beth Harris", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Clayton Kershaw, Los Angeles Dodgers"}, "article_summary": "He was coming off a two-year, $19 million deal.\nKershaw receives the most lucrative deal for a pitcher, breaking the mark of $180 million set by Justin Verlander last March for his seven-year contract with Detroit.\nThe average salary of $30.7 million tops the previous high of $27.5 million, set by the New York Yankees\u2019 Alex Rodriguez as part of a 10-year agreement December 2007.\nKershaw would have been eligible for free agency after the upcoming season if the new deal hadn\u2019t been reached.\nLOS ANGELES \u2014 Pitcher Clayton Kershaw agreed Wednesday to a $215 million, seven-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, a person familiar with the negotiations told The Associated Press, a deal that makes the two-time Cy Young Award winner baseball\u2019s first player with a $30 million average salary."}
