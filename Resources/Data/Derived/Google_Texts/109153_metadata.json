Photograph By BRUCE STOTESBURY, Times Colonist\n\nRobyn Erwin was 24, working at a local retail store and dreaming of studying art at Concordia University in Montreal when she found out she was pregnant.\n\n\u201cI told my boss I was a few weeks pregnant and before my shift the next morning I got a text saying I was fired,\u201d Erwin said at the Young Parents Support Network in Haultain Village.\n\nFortunately, the accountant at her workplace changed her status to laid-off so she could collect employment insurance while she looked for another job.\n\n\u201cBut no one would hire me. I was sick all the time, on my own and scared,\u201d she said. She also needed a cheaper place to live, which is hard to find when you\u2019re young, single and pregnant. Her son was born seven weeks premature and spent a month in hospital.\n\nWhat followed Erwin\u2019s perfect storm of job loss, medical crisis and unexpected single-parenthood was years of navigating social service policies that she, and many others, believe enforces poverty rather than elevates people out of it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really grateful for all the opportunities and programs there are for single parents. They are a gift. But there are a few main things, when my son was little, that could have helped us actually get ahead,\u201d she said.\n\nRead the Hidden Poverty series\n\nBecause Erwin was on employment insurance for six months before her son\u2019s birth, she was not eligible for a full maternity year off. So she went on income assistance and eventually found a minimum-wage job working in a kitchen part time. But whatever money she made was clawed back from her social assistance cheque. Then she had to pay for childcare, which, even at a subsidized rate, was about $300 a month.\n\n\u201cI was literally paying more to work,\u201d Erwin said.\n\n\u201cIf, at that time, I could earn even a few hundred dollars a month [without getting penalized], I would\u2019ve stayed [at the job]. I liked working there.\u201d\n\nNow Erwin is in a similar situation. Her child support payments were clawed back from her social assistance. She has never made more than $14,000 a year.\n\n\u201cI do plan to get out of this,\u201d Erwin said. She took part in the Bridges for Women employment program, will upgrade her schooling in the fall and hopes to study art education. Meanwhile, she manages to squirrel away a few dollars a month into an education fund for her son. \u201cI want him to have a good future,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI certainly see what I would call a lot of legislated poverty,\u201d said Marika Albert, a researcher and program manager of poverty prevention at the Community Social Planning Council of Greater Victoria. She cited the child support clawbacks, low income-assistance rates and a lack of affordable housing in the region as examples.\n\n\u201cOr else we manage poverty as opposed to addressing it,\u201d she said, noting things like a national $10-a-day child care program and increased minimum wage would drastically reduce poverty in the capital region. In Greater Victoria, full-time non-subsidized childcare costs from $800 to $1,700 a month.\n\n\u201cIn one of our recent reports, one family said they get by in tough times by pretending they are playing a Survivor game with food, like seeing how long they can make a little bit of rice last. I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s happening here,\u201d Albert said.\n\nWidespread criticism about child-support clawbacks, which deduct support payments from income assistance for single parents, recently prompted the provincial government to announce a review of the policy. But, to the ire of those wanting action now, it will not be complete until after the next provincial budget in February.\n\nIn its annual B.C. child poverty report card released in late November, the First Call organization said about one in five children in the province were living in poverty. Based on the 2012 census, the number of children living in poverty increased to 169,240. In the previous year, the number cited was 153,000.\n\nThe report noted nearly half of B.C. children living below the poverty line were in single-parent households, 81 per cent of which are headed by women.\n\n\u201cSingle-mom-led families are the worst off in Canada,\u201d said Christine Kenwood, executive director of the Victoria Single Parent Resource Centre. The centre has about 1,800 member families and sees about 20 new clients each month. Eighty per cent of the parents are women, but the number of single fathers is increasing, Kenwood said.\n\n\u201cMost of our people are grappling with poverty and are socially isolated, often without family or friends nearby to help,\u201d she said. The majority, about 80 per cent, earn less than $30,000 a year.\n\nAccording to a study by the Greater Victoria Coalition to End Homelessness, about 260 families last year were in a housing crisis \u2014 either homeless or on the verge of becoming homeless. The majority of these were single-parent, female-led households.\n\nWhen asked by the researchers what the main cause of their homelessness was, families said loss of income was No. 1, followed by lack of affordable housing, then relationship breakdown and barriers to assistance.\n\nAs child poverty numbers in B.C. have increased, so has local food bank use. According to this year\u2019s Hunger Count report from Food Banks Canada, 97,369 people used a food bank in one month this year. Of those, 31 per cent were children. This represents a 24 per cent increase from 2008 to 2014.\n\n\u201cNo government wants to see any child or family living in poverty,\u201d said Stephanie Cadieux, minister of children and family development. While the NDP and citizens groups have been calling for a formal B.C. poverty reduction plan, she said the government doesn\u2019t feel a legislated plan is required.\n\n\u201cHaving an official plan does not guarantee success. That\u2019s why we continue to provide targeted supports,\u201d she said. These include a recent increase in rental supports to at-risk groups, a higher income allowance for those on disability assistance and, starting April 2015, a new B.C. Early Childhood Tax Benefit of up to $660 for eligible families.\n\nCadieux said the effort to alleviate poverty requires ministries to work together and that hers is one of the few to receive any budget increases over the past few years. \u201cIt is also important to realize, it isn\u2019t always about more money, but ensuring that targeted supports are available for those British Columbians who truly need them,\u201d she said.\n\nMiranda Chapman, a single mother of two, said one of her greatest fears is that her children will be stuck with a mentality of living in poverty.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to be any other way than poor. I never wanted that,\u201d said the 30-year-old Victoria resident who lives on $1,400 a month disability assistance with two children.\n\nShe grew up in the Blanshard Courts housing project, where she babysat for sex workers and saw friends\u2019 parents openly do drugs. At 13, she was in foster care, and was in youth housing at 16.\n\n\u201cI always knew I was meant for more, for a better life,\u201d said Chapman. She finished high school, went to college and travelled, despite increasing anxiety and mental-health issues. When she left an abusive relationship three months pregnant, she worried she would end up sliding back into poverty.\n\n\u201cI just assumed I could get a job and then [maternity] leave and a place on my own,\u201d she said. Like Erwin, no one would hire or rent to her. She ended up in emergency and then subsidized housing. Now she plans to study health sciences at Langara College in Vancouver next year and is interested in international development work.\n\n\u201cThe exhaustion that comes with being poor, not knowing where money will come from every month, is overwhelming,\u201d Chapman said. \u201cBut in a way, I want to hide, to not look or feel poor.\u201d\n\nspetrescu@timescolonist.com\n\nThis is a corrected version of an earlier story.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright Times Colonist", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robyn Erwin was 24, working at a local retail store and dreaming of studying art at Concordia University in Montreal when she found out she was pregnant.   \u201cI told my boss I was a few weeks . . .", "title": "Part 2: More B.C. children caught in the cracks", "og": {"site_name": "Times Colonist", "description": "Robyn Erwin was 24, working at a local retail store and dreaming of studying art at Concordia University in Montreal when she found out she was pregnant.   \u201cI told my boss I was a few weeks . . .", "title": "Part 2: More B.C. children caught in the cracks", "url": "http://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/part-2-more-b-c-children-caught-in-the-cracks-1.1697412", "image": "http://images.glaciermedia.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1697416.1419747858!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/facebookogimage_560_292/vka-erwin05568-jpg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Robyn Erwin was 24, working at a local retail store and dreaming of studying art at Concordia University in Montreal when she found out she was pregnant.   \u201cI told my boss I was a few weeks . . .", "creator": "@sarahpetrescu", "image": "http://images.glaciermedia.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1697416.1419747858!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/facebookogimage_560_292/vka-erwin05568-jpg.jpg", "title": "Part 2: More B.C. children caught in the cracks", "site": "@timescolonist", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Sarah Petrescu", "robots": "NOODP", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "fb": {"app_id": 589634334411994}, "msvalidate.01": "B35552358D0685310DF5A3DE206352FA", "MobileOptimized": 320, "DC.creator": "Sarah Petrescu", "keywords": "local , British Columbia", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/timescolonist", "section": "News"}, "DC.subject": "local , British Columbia", "DC.title": "Part 2: More B.C. children caught in the cracks", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "local , British Columbia"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb751\"", "article_summary": "\u201cSingle-mom-led families are the worst off in Canada,\u201d said Christine Kenwood, executive director of the Victoria Single Parent Resource Centre.\n\"I'm really grateful for all the opportunities and programs there are for single parents,\" she says.\nAs child poverty numbers in B.C.\n\u201cI\u2019m really grateful for all the opportunities and programs there are for single parents.\nchild poverty report card released in late November, the First Call organization said about one in five children in the province were living in poverty."}
