Just under a quarter of the money has been spent on weapons, with the rest spent on missions involving military carriers and other operations.\n\nThe cost of the ISIS fight crossed the $1 billion mark last December and the $2 billion mark in April.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The average daily cost over the last year is $10 million, a Pentagon spokesman said.", "description": "The average daily cost over the last year is $10 million, a Pentagon spokesman said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Rebecca Shabad", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The average daily cost over the last year is $10 million, a Pentagon spokesman said.", "title": "US fight against ISIS edges toward $4 billion", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/251989-us-fight-against-isis-edges-toward-4-billion", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/isis03122015getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/251989-us-fight-against-isis-edges-toward-4-billion", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-26T10:55-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Rebecca Shabad", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-26T10:55:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/finance/251989-us-fight-against-isis-edges-toward-4-billion", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The average daily cost over the last year is $10 million, a Pentagon spokesman said.", "card": "summary", "title": "US fight against ISIS edges toward $4 billion"}, "dcterms.title": "US fight against ISIS edges toward $4 billion"}, "article_summary": "The cost of the ISIS fight crossed the $1 billion mark last December and the $2 billion mark in April.\nADVERTISEMENTIn mid-July, the U.S. had surpassed the $3 billion mark in the fight against ISIS.\nIn the first few weeks of the campaign, when the U.S. began launching airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq, the average daily cost was $5.6 million.\nSince the airstrikes were expanded to Syria in mid-September 2014, the daily average cost of operations has increased to $10.5 million.\nAn updated breakdown of the total cost, released by the Pentagon, shows that the daily average cost of operations has increased slightly."}
