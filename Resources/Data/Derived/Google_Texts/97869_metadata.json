Meanwhile, the Brookville campus reported 15 terminations, nine hour reductions and 11 positions lost to attrition.\n\nThe announcement comes on the heels of recent layoffs at Penn Highlands facilities in Clearfield and St. Marys officials say were also meant to \u201cright-size facilities in the wake of reduced inpatient volumes and decreased revenue.\u201d\n\nThey included 28 layoffs, hour reductions for 25 staff and 15 jobs eliminated through attrition at the organization\u2019s Johnsonburg Road, St. Marys facility, known as Penn Highlands Elk or Elk Regional Health Center prior to a 2013 cost-driven merger.\n\nThe positions impacted at all four merged Penn Highlands branches consist of full- and part-time clinical, support and management positions. The move is said to be an outcome of a 2015-16 strategic planning process and system-wide restructuring.\n\nSpokespeople are calling the latest round of cuts, \u201cthe last phase\u201d in that process, saying the organization now plans to instead move forward with widespread service realignments.\n\nIt is welcome news for Penn Highlands employees, including those in Elk County, concerned about the prospect of more job cuts after years of falling profits tied to lower patient numbers and shrinking reimbursements from government and private insurers. As a result, multi-million dollar operating losses have been reported at many of the health system\u2019s area campuses in recent years. Officials expect the recent workforce scalebacks to largely offset the shortfalls.\n\nBut those same officials said future workforce adjustments can\u2019t be entirely ruled out given a \u201cchanging health care landscape\u201d brought on in part by changes enacted with the President\u2019s Affordable Care Act, the reform law dubbed Obamacare by its critics.\n\nA statement issued by Penn Highlands said the current workforce cuts are designed to help position the organization for those changes and \u201cthe future in a rapidly changing health care environment that is negatively affecting hospital and health system bottom lines nationwide.\u201d\n\nEarlier attempts to reduce branch costs and continued financial losses, including a 2014 hiring freeze, were reportedly insufficient, helping to force the layoffs and cutbacks now seen.\n\n\u201cWhile this is an outcome no one wants, reducing staff to match patient activity and national staffing trends is necessary for the long-term health and strength of our hospitals,\u201d John Sutika, president of Penn Highlands DuBois said.\n\n\u201cNot taking such essential action would be irresponsible and would represent a real threat to the continuation of health care services in our region.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "On Thursday, Penn Highlands Healthcare officials said nearly 50 layoffs at hospitals in DuBois and Brookville this week likely represent the last in a push to cut costs and offset falling revenue system-wide.", "og": {"site_name": "The Bradford Era", "description": "On Thursday, Penn Highlands Healthcare officials said nearly 50 layoffs at hospitals in DuBois and Brookville this week likely represent the last in a push to cut costs and offset falling revenue system-wide.", "title": "New wave of Penn Highlands layoffs said to be the last", "url": "http://www.bradfordera.com/news/new-wave-of-penn-highlands-layoffs-said-to-be-the/article_bdd71ae4-df2d-11e4-916f-cfaea7143155.html", "image": "http://www.bradfordera.com/app/bradforderaogimage.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 103463186393070}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Bradford-Era/202797986453490"}, "keywords": "news,local,top_stories,top_story", "google-site-verification": "UzuQoNFsUhWg2ArR7skfNlvb0CAsVDT8zXlYLY28Eog", "news_keywords": "news,local,top_stories,top_story"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd138b\"", "article_summary": "The positions impacted at all four merged Penn Highlands branches consist of full- and part-time clinical, support and management positions.\nOn Thursday, Penn Highlands Healthcare officials said nearly 50 layoffs at hospitals in DuBois and Brookville this week likely represent the last in a push to cut costs and offset falling revenue system-wide.\n\u201cNot taking such essential action would be irresponsible and would represent a real threat to the continuation of health care services in our region.\u201d\n\u201cWhile this is an outcome no one wants, reducing staff to match patient activity and national staffing trends is necessary for the long-term health and strength of our hospitals,\u201d John Sutika, president of Penn Highlands DuBois said.\nIt is welcome news for Penn Highlands employees, including those in Elk County, concerned about the prospect of more job cuts after years of falling profits tied to lower patient numbers and shrinking reimbursements from government and private insurers."}
