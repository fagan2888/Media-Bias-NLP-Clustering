The board also voted unanimously to subsidize the emergency medical service to the tune of $170,000 for the fiscal year beginning July 1 and ending June 30, 2015.\n\nCounty Administrative Director Renee Obermueller explained the contract review is standard procedure.\n\n\u201cWe look at this contract annually,\u201d she said. \u2018We\u2019ve had a meeting with Rocky Mountain (Ambulance) to see where they\u2019re at with charity care, write-offs, the new (Affordable Care Act) and how its affecting Medicare payments, and this is one of the other avenues of the county we have to look at.\u201d\n\nObermueller acknowledged the contract for medical services is unique in that the private company is subsidized by the local municipal and county government.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a county service, but we\u2019re also subsidizing that service,\u201d she said, adding this year\u2019s subsidy has been negotiated down $5,000 from last year.\n\nCommissioner Steve Maier reflected that the subsidy is essential for public safety.\n\n\u201cNobody likes to do a subsidy, but the reality is we\u2019ve asked them to provide service countywide, which includes the mountain, it includes Arvada, it includes a wide variety of distances and they can\u2019t turn people down,\u201d Maier said.\n\n\u201cSo they, like the hospital, have a significant write-off and we get to review their financials.\u201d\n\nMaier provided more commentary in an effort to thwart any potential sticker shock for board members.\n\n\u201cThere was a time not too long ago we had a public ambulance service that was being subsidized in the million-dollar plus. Working with the private sector, we\u2019ve got it down to a total of a couple hundred thousand dollars and I think the service has been good.\n\n\u201cNobody likes subsidies, but we want to guarantee our citizens service anywhere in Sheridan County, so we have to do this,\u201d Maier said, adding that he appreciates the contributions of the county\u2019s numerous fire departments and municipally owned ambulances that assist in emergency responses within the area as well.\n\nAlso at Tuesday\u2019s regularly scheduled meeting, the Sheridan County BOCC:\n\n\u2022 awarded a contract to install a fireproof pond liner at the Sheridan County Airport Fuel Farm to ShotCrete Montana, based out of Absarokee, Montana. ShotCrete will install a product called Milliken CC-8 Concrete Cloth in compliance with regulations established by the Department of Environmental Quality. The project will cost $27,296.\n\n\u2022 acknowledged the receipt of a conceptual master plan for the Sheridan County Airport. Ryan Hayes, of Mead & Hunt Consulting, presented a plan to reorganize the existing county air terminal and add floor space to departments when and if enplanements increase.\n\n\u201cThis is to recognize that when the enplanement situation turns around, when the air service situation turns around at Sheridan County Airport, you will have a plan to move forward that involves a new terminal building,\u201d he said, indicating another main priority of the new facility plan would be to separate commercial and general aviation traffic.\n\n\u2022 unanimously approved the continuation of a Memorandum of Understanding between the county and the Wyoming Guardian Ad Litem program.\n\n\u201cThe GAL program, in summary, offers legal assistance to children in need,\u201d Obermueller said. \u201cThis could be for supervision cases, parental rights, etc. These attorneys are funded by the state and we, as a county, are required to pay 25 percent of their fees.\u201d\n\n\u2022 agreed to begin the process of vacating a portion of Upper Big Horn Sheridan Road that is on the property of the county airport. The heavily used portion of the road will remain open.\n\n\u2022 renewed a two-year Memorandum of Understanding with the Wyoming Department of Health\u2019s Public Health Division to support a local maternal and child health program.\n\n\u201cWe do staff a county nurse to fill this position, but it is 100 percent funded by a grant,\u201d Obermueller said.\n\n\u2022 agreed to accept Countywide Consensus Block Grant Funding.\n\n\u201cThe legislature again approved in the (2015-2016) biennium, $70 million to be distributed statewide. Sheridan County\u2019s portion of that is 5.62 percent of that, which is $3,936,635,\u201d Obermueller said.\n\nThe money will be divided among governmental entities in Sheridan County after individual resolutions are approved.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Sheridan Press", "description": "Rocky Mountain Ambulance responds to a bicycle accident in 2012.
