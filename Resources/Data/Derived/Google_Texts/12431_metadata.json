Generally speaking, they work together against the consumer.\n\nAdvertisement - story continues below\n\nThere appears to be a mistaken belief on the Left that any government action is either done in the interest of \u201cthe people\u201d or in the interest of corporations and rich oligarchs. So the naked corporate welfare to Archer Daniels Midlands is called out, as are the sports stadiums being paid for by taxpayers, and of course the banker bailouts as well. (Although, it should be noted that congressional Democrats voted in support of TARP by a rate of three to one, whereas a slight majority of Republicans opposed it.)\n\nIn general, however, the Left seems to see tax cuts as corporate welfare while ignoring or outright supporting corporate welfare in many of its guises. The reason is because corporate welfare is rarely sold to the public as a way to help millionaires become billionaires at the taxpayer\u2019s expense. It\u2019s much more insidious than that. Usually, this cronyism comes wrapped in a bill of goods that makes it much easier to swallow.\n\nObamacare\n\nWhile the Right yells about how the so-called Obamacare is socialized medicine, it would actually best be described as a corporatist scheme. Or in other words, it\u2019s corporate welfare.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIndeed, if it were some socialist scheme to destroy private enterprise, one would suspect that these companies\u2019 stock prices would plummet before the passing of the bill (March 23, 2010). Here\u2019s what actually happened in the year prior to the bill\u2019s passing for the five largest health insurance companies (the Dow Jones is in red):\n\nChart from Finance.Yahoo.com (WLP = Anthem; CI = Cigna; HUM = Humana; AET = Aetna; UNH = United Healthcare)\n\nThe average return for these five companies over the year was 72.85 percent, almost twice that of the Dow Jones Industrial average. Cigna lead the group with a 98.5 percent increase. Now, it\u2019s important to understand how stock prices are valued. They are not derived from the value of the assets a company holds, or even what the company has done recently. Instead, they are valued by how much a company is expected to make in the future and how much those future cash flows are worth today.\n\nIn other words, investors seemed to be uniformly of the opinion that Obamacare was good for business. And they were right. Here are those same companies\u2019 performances during the last five years:\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be hard to see why an individual mandate and billions in subsidies for people to buy insurance from these companies could increase profits. This is especially true given all of the rate increases. The law\u2019s poor conception has pushed health insurance companies to seek rate increases of 20 to 40 percent for 2016 because the \u201cnew customers \u2026 turned out to be sicker than expected.\u201d\n\nHow about the pharmaceutical companies? In March of 2009, Billy Tauzin, head of PhARMA (the main lobbying group for the pharmaceutical industry) was asked whether investors should be worried about the upcoming healthcare reform. He responded as follows:\n\nThink about what this plan does: This plan talks about providing comprehensive health insurance to people who don\u2019t have it. That means to patients who can\u2019t take our medicines because they can\u2019t afford it: $650 billion spent to better insure Americans for the products we make. That ought to be a very optimistic and positive message for everyone [who] is interested in our sector of the economy.\n\nThey continued:\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nMike Huckman: \u201c\u2026 if there is some kind of universal healthcare plan where prescription drugs are more broadly available and they\u2019re available at a cheaper price, [is it possible] that your sector may make up in a higher prescription volume and sales what it might lose on price?\u201d Billy Tauzin: \u201cAbsolutely, think about this: almost half of the prescriptions that get written today go unfilled \u2026 primarily because people don\u2019t have adequate insurance.\u201d\n\nThe LA Times reported that \u201cTauzin has morphed into the president\u2019s partner. He has been invited to the White House half a dozen times in recent months.\u201d Tim Carney lists some of the blatant corporate welfare in the bill:\n\n1. Complex drugs known as biologics will receive a 12 year monopoly patent instead of the standard 5 years. 2. The individual mandate will require everyone to buy prescription drug insurance. 3. $196 billion in annual subsidies will be given to poor and middle class Americans to buy health insurance. 4. It preserves the 2003 Medicare Part D stipulation that prohibits Medicare from negotiating down prices for drugs it subsidizes. 5. It continues to prevent re-importation of drugs from Canada.\n\nGiven this, it\u2019s not surprising that the drug industry paid $150 million to support Obamacare with things such as this delightful ad:\n\nCap and Trade\n\nEarly in Obama\u2019s presidency (and John McCain\u2019s platform), he pushed for \u201ccap and trade,\u201d a market-driven method to fight global warming. Or more accurately, a corporate welfare-laden plan that wouldn\u2019t do much of anything.\n\nPaul Krugman accused opponents of the bill of committing \u201ctreason against the planet,\u201d and most of the left seemed to agree. But to give credit where credit is due, Dennis Kucinich actually hit the nail on the head:\n\n[H.R. 2454, the cap-and-trade bill] is regressive. Free allocations doled out with the intent of blunting the effects on those of modest means will pale in comparison to the allocations that go to polluters and special interests. The financial benefits of offsets and unlimited banking also tend to accrue to large corporations. And of course, the trillion dollar carbon derivatives market will help Wall Street investors. Much of the benefits designed to assist consumers are passed through coal companies and other large corporations, on whom we will rely to pass on the savings.\n\nIndeed, Al Gore makes an interesting observation in some of the bonus material to his documentary An Inconvenient Truth:\n\nA lot of business leaders are changing their positions. New businesses and CEO\u2019s and corporations every week are now joining this new bandwagon saying \u201cwe want to be part of the solution and not part of the problem.\u201d\n\nOr perhaps they just saw gobs of money available to be made by getting in line with the government. After all, there was the Solyndra scandal, and then GE reduced its tax burden to zero primarily with green energy tax credits. Al Gore has even gotten in on the government dole for green technology and made a fortune. And then of course, there was Ken Lay.\n\nIn 1997, then-Enron CEO Lay wrote an op-ed entitled \u201cFor Prevention\u2019s Sake: Focus on Climate Solutions.\u201d In it, he strongly advocated the Kyoto Protocol, which would cap carbon emissions worldwide. On August 4, 1997, Lay met with Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and others at the White House to discuss Kyoto. He was an enthusiastic supporter. In 2001, Lay sent an emissary to the Bush administration to lobby for Kyoto. Surprisingly, his old friend turned him down (other interests to appease perhaps?). And of course, the reason Enron wanted cap and trade was the same as Goldman Sachs: to create a new energy market for them to trade in.\n\nCigarette Cronyism\n\nInterestingly enough, the government actually makes more money off of tobacco than the tobacco industry (about $48 billion to $35 billion). And oddly (and morbidly), smoking probably saves the government money as it just means people die when they\u2019re 50 or 60 instead of when they are 70 or 80 (and thus collect less Social Security and Medicare).\n\nCigarettes are still the most preventable cause of death around. So many would think the 1998 government lawsuit that lead to the Master Settlement Agreement would be a good thing. Not so fast. Here\u2019s how Tim Carney describes it:\n\nIn exchange for settling all the state lawsuits filed in the 1990\u2019s, the companies promised huge annual payments to state governments. To safeguard the new revenue stream, the states passed laws protecting Big Tobacco [the four largest retailers] from smaller competitors. Critics have called the MSA, \u201cone of the most effective and destructive cartels in the history of the Nation.\u201d\n\nMany states are now extremely reliant on this tobacco money making; the government and tobacco industry are two peas in a pod.\n\nWhat the Master Settlement Agreement did was simply cartelize the market. The settlement banned most advertising, which of course favored the big companies with well-known brands. But it also made sure \u201c\u2026 that tobacco companies that were never sued, were never accused of wrongdoing, and in some cases didn\u2019t exist when the alleged deception and wrongdoing occurred, and certainly never participated in the settlement would pay the same damages as the Big Tobacco companies\u2026\u201d The economies of scale for larger companies make these costs easier to swallow.\n\nSmall companies could get out of these payments if they \u201c\u2026 joined the settlement within 90 days of its completion. \u2026\u201d But of course, there was a catch: \u201c\u2026 small companies signing on to the MSA were not allowed to grow by more than 25 percent.\u201d\n\nIndeed, it\u2019s hard to think of a better way to cartelize a market.\n\nConclusion\n\nBig government is not a hedge against big corporations. Generally speaking, they work together against the consumer. While government intervention in healthcare reform, greenhouse emissions, and tobacco could be attempted in a way that didn\u2019t line the pockets of big corporations, it rarely turns out that way. Entrenched interests are the ones with influence, after all. The best way to reduce the power and influence of corporations is to reduce the power and influence of government. Such a reduction would force firms to compete without special favors on the free market. Price and quality would be what sets companies apart, not their ability to influence politicians.\n\nThis commentary originally appeared at Mises.org and is reprinted here under a Creative Commons license.\n\nThe views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by the owners of this website.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Big government is not a hedge against big corporations.
