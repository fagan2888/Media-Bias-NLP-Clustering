He was helped out of the cart by two Redskins employees and gimped into the practice facility for evaluation.\n\nCoach Jay Gruden said Hall did a somersault during a red-zone drill and landed strangely on his back. He also said Hall could have walked off under his own power, but they drove him off as a precaution.\n\nSEE ALSO: With a Redskins roster spot in his sights, rookie Ryan Grant is all business\n\nLinebacker Brian Orakpo also sat out practice. He said his quad was \u201churting a little bit.\u201d Gruden called it a thigh contusion.\n\n\u201cA little caution,\u201d Orakpo said. \u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d\n\nWide receivers Pierre Gar\u00e7on and DeSean Jackson sat out of team drills as they continue to recover from hamstring strains. Gruden thinks Jackson is making progress and could be available for the Aug. 18 preseason game against the Cleveland Browns.\n\nFree safety Ryan Clark and strong safety Phillip Thomas missed all of practice with strained hamstrings.\n\nDefensive end Jason Hatcher, who returned to practice Saturday and was activated from the physically-unable-to-perform list, continued to be held out of team drills as his surgically repaired right knee strengthens.\n\nTight end Jordan Reed did not attend practice after missing Saturday\u2019s session with a stomach virus. Running back Chris Thompson sat out with a sprained ankle and inside linebacker Darryl Sharpton has a high right ankle sprain. Gruden said Sharpton could be out for some time, though Sharpton disputed that idea.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s kind of one of those day-to-day things, so it shouldn\u2019t be anything lengthy or anything that requires anything major,\u201d said Sharpton, who injured the ankle in the preseason opener. \u201cIt\u2019s just a matter of just healing up and just getting better every day.\u201d\n\nRunning back Silas Redd sat out with a mild ankle sprain. Tight end Mike Caussin (knee) was out for the second consecutive day.\n\nRunning back Lache Seastrunk experienced inflammation in the arch of one of his feet, but said that he refused to leave practice.\n\n\u201cI just got to tough it out,\u201d Seastrunk said. \u201cIt\u2019s not killing me. I\u2019m running. I\u2019m still gonna do what I\u2019ve got to do. I\u2019ve got to show them I\u2019m tough.\u201d\n\nThat pleased Gruden.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for these guys to play through these nagging injuries,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cIf you can play through it, it\u2019s great. He has played through a sore foot the past couple days.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The injuries are piling up for the Washington Redskins.
