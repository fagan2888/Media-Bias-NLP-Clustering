JG: Oh, he knows how it works. He\u2019s just being deceptive. HH: All right. JG: I mean, now basically, now there will be differences across people, but on average, people will pay less. And we\u2019re only, once again, we\u2019re only talking about a minority of people, where I\u2019m talking about the majority of Americans who have insurance from their employer.\n\nHugh then followed up with the now-infamous Barack Obama promise that you can keep your plan, and your doctor, if you like your plan and your doctor, and asked Dr. Gruber if that was also just as deceptive, being that he has no problem calling deception where he sees is.\n\nJG: The President was, no, he was not being deceptive. I don\u2019t think he was being deceptive. I think the President was not being fully clear in what he said.\n\nTwo segments later, Hugh came around to the veracity issue this way.\n\nHH: Dr. Gruber, if a student of yours had plagiarized fifteen percent of a paper he turned in, would he be expelled from MIT? JG: He\u2019d certainly be up for disciplinary action, absolutely. HH: And so if the President misled fifteen percent of the American people, and only fifteen percent, isn\u2019t that a deception of the sort Ron Johnson\u2019s talking about? JG: Okay, the President, he did mislead a small share of the U.S. population. It\u2019s not fifteen percent. As I said, it\u2019s on the order of two to four percent. HH: And so if your student had only plagiarized two to four percent of his paper, would he still be in trouble? JG: Probably, yeah. HH: Yeah. JG: And President Obama has certainly gotten in trouble for this.\n\nI was struck as I heard this of the often misattributed quote that has been alleged to have originated with George Bernard Shaw, Groucho Marx and Winston Churchill. The earliest iteration of this quote was found in as an anecdote in an O. O. McIntyre syndicated newspaper column in 1937.\n\n\u201cThey are telling this of Lord Beaverbrook and a visiting Yankee actress. In a game of hypothetical questions, Beaverbrook asked the lady: \u2018Would you live with a stranger if he paid you one million pounds?\u2019 She said she would. \u2018And if be paid you five pounds?\u2019 The irate lady fumed: \u2018Five pounds. What do you think I am?\u2019 Beaverbrook replied: \u2018We\u2019ve already established that. Now we are trying to determine the degree.\u201d\n\nSo Gruber has established the President misled. We\u2019re just haggling over the number of people, so far, to which he did mislead. The full transcript and audio of the interview are available here, but the takeaway is that even the President\u2019s best Chip Diller, and admittedly, Dr. Gruber is as good a defender of Obamacare as there is, even he can\u2019t calm the panic that is spreading throughout the Democratic Party, as AP captured below in both House and Senate emergency caucus meetings with administration officials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI know it\u2019s tempting for Republicans to offer a life raft, but after 47 throws that have been previously refused, number 48 should be really simple. Total repeal. If the Democrats say no, I\u2019m comfortable letting America have one more bite at the Obamacare referendum in November of 2014 after they see whether Dr. Gruber was right or not.\n\nRecently in the Green Room:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare Architect Admits Obama Misled Americans, But\u2026", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Greenroom", "description": "\u2026it\u2019s such a paltry pittance of a deception, deceit, fraud or out and out lie, because it only applies to a few million people, a mere two to four percent of the people who really could\u2026", "title": "Obamacare Architect Admits Obama Misled Americans, But\u2026", "url": "http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2013/11/14/obamacare-architect-admits-obama-misled-americans-but/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-14T08:12:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-14T08:22:56+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb8c5\"", "article_summary": "HH: Dr. Gruber, if a student of yours had plagiarized fifteen percent of a paper he turned in, would he be expelled from MIT?\nDr. Gruber responded to noted Obamacare critic Avik Roy of the Manhattan Institute this way.\nIf the Democrats say no, I\u2019m comfortable letting America have one more bite at the Obamacare referendum in November of 2014 after they see whether Dr. Gruber was right or not.\nJG: And President Obama has certainly gotten in trouble for this.\nNow we are trying to determine the degree.\u201dSo Gruber has established the President misled."}
