Arborists use ropes and harnesses to manage the growth of tall trees in urban areas.\n\nJocelyn Lohse, of the mid-Atlantic region, begins her climb on Sunday.

(Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer)\n\nChisholm, who came in third overall in the men's competition, said he competes because he loves pushing himself to stay fit and keep up with industry trends.\n\n\"To come here and do well, you have to improve and stay current,\" he said. \"You keep learning the safest and best techniques.\"\n\nBill Conn, North American Tree Climbing Championship committee chairman, said the North American competition started in 2011. The top climbers from regional chapter competitions are invited.\n\n\"It's bringing the best climbers together for education and bragging rights,\" he said.\n\nThe competition started Saturday with a preliminary round of five events. Included was an aerial rescue, in which competitors safely retrieve a dummy stuck in the limbs, and a work climb, in which competitors move around the tree using a climbing line and saddle/harness.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday, 12 finalists competed in a masters' challenge \u2014 maneuvering through a towering ash to hit four stations to show different skills \u2014 and the footlock climb. The winners of Sunday's masters' challenge go on to compete in the international tree-climbing championships in San Antonio, Texas, in April.\n\nThe men's winner was Miguel Pastenes of Dallas. The women's winner was Marilou Dussault of Quebec.\n\n\"You have got to be able to read the tree,\" said Dussault, who started working as an arborist at 18. \"It has to speak to you.\"\n\nJudges watch and take notes Sunday during the North American Tree Climbing Championship.

(Cliff Grassmick / Staff Photographer)\n\nShe added that winning competitions like this \u2014 she's now a three-time North American champion \u2014 takes a bit of luck and a \"competitive spirit.\"\n\nComing in second in the men's competition was Luke Glines of Greeley, representing the Rocky Mountain Chapter.\n\n\"It's a way to test my skills against the best in the country,\" he said. \"You have to be really thoughtful and patient about how you climb and really safe. There's a lot to it.\"\n\nAlso representing the Rocky Mountain Chapter in the finals was Ray Rockett, who works part-time for Longmont's forestry department and freelances for various Boulder County tree-trimming companies as a professional arborist.\n\n\"The event is a way to increase awareness of what arborists do and share ideas \u2014 and it's fun,\" he said. \"All the events simulate real world work situations. There were lots of great climbers here and great weather. It was a really well run event. It was a great weekend.\"\n\nAmy Bounds: 303-473-1341, boundsa@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/boundsa", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/longmont-news/ci_28848965/top-north-american-tree-climbers-compete-longmont", "sailthru.author": "By Amy Bounds \n \n  Staff Writer", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28848965:view"}, "startDate": "2015-09-20T19:40:43-0600", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "North America's best tree climbers went head-to-head Sunday in Longmont, racing almost 50 feet up an Ash tree by pushing on a double rope with their feet in an inchworm style climb.
