COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. – By virtue of its higher composite computer average in the rankings of Sunday, Nov. 29, San Diego State will host Air Force in the 2015 Sports Authority Mountain West Football Championship Game on Saturday, Dec. 5 at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego.

The Aztecs (8-0 MW, 9-3 overall), led by fifth-year head coach Rocky Long, clinched the West Division on Nov. 21 with their 52-14 victory at UNLV. SDSU, who was MW tri-champions in 2012, is in search of its first outright Mountain West football title. It would also be the Aztecs’ first outright football crown overall since 1986.

Under ninth-year head coach Troy Calhoun, the Falcons (6-2 MW, 8-4 overall) captured the Mountain Division after a 37-30 victory at Boise State on Nov. 20.
