Sean Hannity made quite a bold assertion on his radio show today: President Obama is “the Manchurian candidate.” Hannity asserted that the president is an extreme radical who is not who he claims to be.

Hannity declared that Obama “has governed as a radical, he has never shown a propensity to adjust, any side of this man!” He said Obama’s never had a “Sister Souljah moment” where he’s spoken out against people on his team.

But Hannity really ratcheted things up when he said, “He is the Manchurian candidate. He knows one thing, radicalism, and that is how he’s governed, and he will govern that way to the end.”
