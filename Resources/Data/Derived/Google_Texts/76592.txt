The 11A Championship game was expected to be a high scoring contest between rivals Madison and Dell Rapids. The Qaurries had won three of the last four titles, while the Bulldogs were looking to hoist their first crown after finishing runner up the year before.

Madison kicked off to start the game and Dells Rapids senior Riley Schmidt took it 81 yards for a touchdown to give his team a 6-0 nothing lead right away. That score would be the only one either team got the remainder of the half.

In the third quarter the Quarries struck again by giving to Schmidt and he went 54 yards for his second TD extending Dells lead to 12. The Bulldogs would respond later in the quarter when QB Mitch Hansen connected with Carter Kasuke, he completed the 71 yard pitch and catch in the endzone brining Madison within five.

However that would be Madisonâ€™s only score of the night. Dell Rapids would go on to win 12-6. Schmidt accounted for 244 of the Quarriers 341 yards earning him Back of the Game and Joe Robbie M.V.P. honors.
