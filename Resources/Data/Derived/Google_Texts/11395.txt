Oh my. This is just about the most precious feline rescue you'll see.

WBTV reporter David Whisenant was driving a Ford Explorer around Salisbury, N.C., when he heard what sounded like an animal inside the car engine, WBTV reports.

Whisenant stopped at a Shell gas station, where mechanic Joe Bost found a kitten wedged on top of the gas tank and managed to get her out.

The little kitty was since christened the "News Cat," according to WBTV.

She was taken to a veterinarian who confirmed that she hadn't been injured in the incident.

According to WFMY News 2, she is now at Rowan Animal Shelter and is available for adoption.
