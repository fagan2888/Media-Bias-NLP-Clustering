These attacks would be aimed at FBI agents, other law enforcement personnel and members of the news media.\n\nRelated: New U.S. Price Tag for the War Against ISIS: $40 Billion a Year\n\nYet a new government survey shows that the massive homeland security department is plagued by what The Washington Post described as longstanding \u201cdebilitating morale problems\u201d that have worsened during the Obama administration and \u201cgrown more serious\u201d since Secretary Jeh Johnson took over in December.\n\nThe personnel problems were documented in the 2014 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, an annual survey by the Office of Personnel Management to measure government morale and efficiency. While a substantial majority of DHS employees are hard-working and dedicated to carrying out their mission, the study shows that \u201cmany say the department discourages innovation, treats employees in an arbitrary fashion and fails to recruit skilled personnel,\u201d according to data obtained by The Post.\n\nMore than 40,000 DHS workers responded to the survey, and only 41.6 percent said they were satisfied with their employer, down from 44.4 percent the previous year.\n\nThe results were particularly damning for Johnson, a former federal prosecutor and general counsel of the Department of Defense who vowed to improve morale when he took the reins of the department. In the case of the DHS Science and Technology Directorate, responsible for research and development, only 21 percent of employees expressed positive views of their leader\u2019s ability to \u201cgenerate high levels of motivation and commitment in the workplace,\u201d said The Post.\n\nRelated: DHS Winks at Workers Stealing Unearned Overtime\n\nCreated by Congress and the Bush administration in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2011 terrorist attacks, DHS serves as an umbrella organization for more than a dozen law enforcement agencies and roughly 230,000 employees. The workers are involved in everything from border security and immigration to the coast guard, federal emergency management and the Secret Service.\n\nThe latest survey findings echo those from previous studies, including last year\u2019s Partnership for Public Service \u201cbest places to work\u201d survey, which ranked DHS 19th out of 19 major agencies \u2013 with just 46.8 percent of employees expressing satisfaction. Among the employees least satisfied were those working for Customs and Border Protection, Transportation Security Administration, Intelligence and Analysis, and the National Protection and Program Directorate.\n\nThe morale crisis has led to a serious brain drain in recent years. Johnson took office declaring that bolstering sagging morale and filling vacancies were his top concerns. Last Friday, he and DHS Deputy Secretary Alejandro N. Mayorkas sent out a department-wide email telling workers that they deserved \u201ca workplace that recognizes your efforts, supports your great work, and fulfills your highest aspirations . . . [but] it is clear from feedback since the creation of this Department that many of you do not feel that you have such a workplace.\u201d\n\nWith the U.S. leading airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria, some experts warn of possible retaliation against the U.S., either by American citizens who have gone overseas to fight with ISIS and then returned home, or other \u201chomegrown\u201d radical jihadists who are planning terror attacks against other Americans.\n\nRelated: Merger of ISIS and al-Qaeda Could Cripple the Civilized World\n\nThe government over the years has poured massive sums into the operations of the sprawling Department of Homeland Security and other agencies that are responsible for protecting Americans and their food supply, government buildings and national parks from terrorist attacks. One recent estimate says the government spends about $70 billion annually on homeland security operations.\n\nThe Fiscal Times reported last week that some of those programs may be bolstered even more in light of the potential threat from ISIS sympathizers.\n\nOn Sunday, CNN reported that the new FBI-Homeland Security warning to law enforcement officials cites \u201cincreased chatter in recent weeks on social media and extremist forums.\u201d The warning was based on information from recent crackdowns on alleged ISIS members and sympathizers in the United Kingdom and Australia.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Amid a new warning that homegrown terrorists and \u201clone wolves\u201d inspired by ISIS may be", "title": "Homeland Security\u2019s Morale Crisis Puts Americans at Risk", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/13/Worst-Time-Homeland-Security-Morale-Crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Homeland_Security_Sign.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2014/10/13/Worst-Time-Homeland-Security-Morale-Crisis", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Homeland_Security_Sign.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Amid a new warning that homegrown terrorists and \u201clone wolves\u201d inspired by ISIS may be", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7429\"", "article_summary": "More than 40,000 DHS workers responded to the survey, and only 41.6 percent said they were satisfied with their employer, down from 44.4 percent the previous year.\nThe personnel problems were documented in the 2014 Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey, an annual survey by the Office of Personnel Management to measure government morale and efficiency.\nThe morale crisis has led to a serious brain drain in recent years.\nThese attacks would be aimed at FBI agents, other law enforcement personnel and members of the news media.\nOver the weekend CNN reported that the FBI and DHS have voiced \u201cfresh concerns\u201d in a new security bulletin about possible terrorist attacks by U.S.-based terrorists sympathetic to ISIS."}
