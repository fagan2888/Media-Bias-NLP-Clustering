Just 44% of business owners anticipate improving conditions this year. Comparatively, 78% of respondents expected improving business conditions in the 2015 report.\n\n\n\nThe reasons for that 34 percentage-point drop in confidence are varied, but much of the concern is chalked up to the coming presidential election, stock market turmoil and the impact of government regulations.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe future for the next four years is hinging on the election \u2014 no matter which way it goes,\u201d noted one respondent.\n\n\n\nThe sixth annual survey was conducted throughout January. The firm does not specify how many individuals took the survey.\n\n\n\nNotably, 28% of respondents say they actually expect business conditions to decline, compared with just 7% last year. Despite that, 63% of business owners expect conditions to improve within their own companies \u2014 just a decline of 10 percentage points from last year.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt is particularly interesting that business leaders are more optimistic about their own organizations than the business outlook overall,\u201d said Carl Grassi, president of McDonald Hopkins, in a news release about the survey.\n\n\n\nRegarding the presidential election, most surveyed believe little will be accomplished in the way of tax reform. A majority of respondents (71%) say comprehensive tax reform is important to their companies, but 77% are not optimistic that the election will make that any easier to achieve.\n\n\n\nMarking a continuation from 2015, increasing health care costs continue to top respondents\u2019 list of challenges to companies in 2016 \u2014 65% of those surveyed say they expect the Affordable Care Act to have a negative impact on their bottom line.\n\n\n\nBehind health care costs, the other top concerns facing business owners, according to the survey, are retaining profit margins and government regulations.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe continue to get buried with more and more government paperwork,\u201d one respondent said. \u201cIt is nearly impossible to learn about and comply with the dozens of new regulations that get enacted, and the government doesn\u2019t have the money or manpower to educate us about them.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Presidential election, stock market turmoil and government regulations hinders optimism about improving business conditions, according to McDonald Hopkins' annual business outlook survey.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Cleveland Business", "description": "Presidential election, stock market turmoil and government regulations hinders optimism about improving business conditions, according to McDonald Hopkins' annual business outlook survey.", "title": "Business owners and executives are much less optimistic about 2016, McDonald Hopkins survey finds", "url": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/article/20160205/NEWS/160209880/business-owners-and-executives-are-much-less-optimistic-about-2016", "image": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/assets/cc/CCLB_Iconv2.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@crainscleveland", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#a91d38", "fb": {"app_id": 730748806957003}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"section": "NEWS", "published_time": "2016-02-05T11:11:26-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-11T09:00:00-05:00", "author": "http://www.crainscleveland.com/staff/1"}, "verify-v1": "Q00KiEdlx7oJ8JL4E1sfoHDh6tgQLZQyOh8A1oVCsIs=", "theme-color": "#a91d38"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc0b\"", "article_summary": "Confidence in U.S. business conditions this year has tanked compared with 2015, according to the McDonald Hopkins 2016 Business Outlook Survey.\nComing off a year when business owners and executives were much more optimistic about improving business conditions, many have changed their tune.\nDespite that, 63% of business owners expect conditions to improve within their own companies \u2014 just a decline of 10 percentage points from last year.\nJust 44% of business owners anticipate improving conditions this year.\nNotably, 28% of respondents say they actually expect business conditions to decline, compared with just 7% last year."}
