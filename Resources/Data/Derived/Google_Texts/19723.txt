HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — Vietnam’s coast guard in a rare move has seized a Chinese vessel for allegedly intruding in its waters.

The Thanh Nien newspaper reported Monday that the vessel has been towed to the northern port city of Hai Phong, and that the ship, its captain and two sailors, all Chinese, are under the supervision of Vietnamese authorities.

The newspaper says the vessel was disguised as a fishing boat and was carrying 100,000 liters of diesel oil near Bach Long Vi island in the Gulf of Tonkin on Thursday.

The captain told authorities the fuel was to be sold to Chinese fishing boats operating in the area.

Vietnam’s coast guard often warns and chases Chinese fishing boats out of its waters but rarely seizes them.
