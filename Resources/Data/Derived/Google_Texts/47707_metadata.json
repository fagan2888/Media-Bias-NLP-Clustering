Mark Holden, general counsel for Koch Industries, said, \u201cThe story is unhinged, untrue and an attempt at character assassination through innuendo and insinuation.\u201d\n\nWhile the Kochs are hit with a guilt-by-association charge, the author doesn\u2019t make the same charge against former Rep. Ron Paul, who Ames writes works closely with an aide who has questioned the historical reports that six million Jews were killed in death camps.\n\nThe story was apparently sparked when Cruz compared pundits supporting Obamacare to Hitler\u2019s appeasers in Britain during his recent 21-hour Senate talk.\n\nConcluded Ames, \u201cToday, the loudest bleaters about the Holocaust and the worst abusers of Holocaust analogies are the same Tea Party libertarians whose roots lie in the sordid effort to deny the Holocaust, but who today abuse, flog and inflate away the Holocaust by comparing every political dispute to the Nazi genocide.\u201d\n\nPaul Bedard, the Washington Examiner's \"Washington Secrets\" columnist, can be contacted at pbedard@washingtonexaminer.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new and circumstantial report about the roots of the Tea Party tries to tie conservative donor Charles Koch and Texas Republican Sen.
