On Oct. 1, those folks began getting their actual renewal rates. And for most of them, it isn\u2019t pretty.\n\n\u201cPeople who have pre-ACA plans are getting clobbered with higher rates and higher exposure\u201d to out-of-pocket costs, said Pat Casale of brokerage firm Pat Casale &Associates.\n\nThe reason premiums are on the rise is because the federal government mandates new requirements in all insurance plans sold after Jan 1. Some of that is good news for consumers: Insurers no longer can put lifetime dollar limits on policy payouts, and some preventive services are now free.\n\nThe thing is, those perks cost consumers \u2014 sometimes a lot. And insurers are building those costs into their premiums.\n\nBill Wright of Chamber Insurance Benefits estimated that 75 percent to 80 percent of his firm\u2019s early renewals are seeing premium gains today, with almost half of those clients seeing premium spikes of at least 50 percent. That includes \u201cmany, many\u201d clients who will pay more than double their current premiums, he said.\n\nSmall companies with younger, healthier workforces are hit especially hard, because the law limits the premium breaks people can get for being young and healthy.\n\nBut talking about premiums alone is a \u201cvery incomplete analysis,\u201d said Kirstine Sorenson of Casale &Associates.\n\nThat\u2019s because consumers\u2019 out-of-pocket costs in deductibles and copays are spiking as well. Where premiums are up 50 percent, out-of-pocket expenses might soar 200 percent, Sorenson said. Some consumers are paying $250 a month in premiums for plans with $5,000 deductibles, compared with $100 a month for a $5,000 deductible before the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cPeople are seeing increases on the internal parts of their plan that are magnifying their higher costs,\u201d Sorenson said.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, insurers have added a fourth tier to pharmaceuticals coverage, Wright said. Now, drugs that used to cost $60 a month might cost as much as $250 a month.\n\nEmployers are dealing with the cost increases in several ways.\n\nSome are making employees pick up more of the tab. A company that traditionally paid 75 percent of workers\u2019 premiums might now cover just half of the cost, Wright said.\n\nOthers are moving employees out of group plans and into individual coverage. Still others are cutting their coverage tier, dropping from a richer gold or platinum plan that pays 80 percent to 90 percent of costs into a silver or bronze plan that pays just 60 percent or 70 percent of covered expenses.\n\nOne thing hardly anybody seems to be doing: Dropping coverage altogether.\n\n\u201cBut keep in mind we\u2019re only 13 days into this renewal cycle,\u201d Wright said. \u201cI think that decision is one a lot of people will be contemplating between now and the last day of November. They have a very hard decision to make about whether they can afford a rate increase, whether they can still afford to provide group coverage or whether they\u2019ll have to reduce benefits because of increased costs brought about by the ACA.\u201d\n\n\u25a0 Patricia of Las Vegas read our Oct. 12 report on how to buy coverage in the upcoming open-enrollment session, and she had additional questions. Patricia wanted to know if Nevada Health Link\u2019s switch to the federal healthcare.gov system might be a problem if appeals courts rule that federal tax credits are only for states with state-run exchanges.\n\n\u201cMy bottom line question is: Is it safe for someone with a pre-existing condition to drop a grandfathered plan and enroll in the ACA? Will Nevada ACA plans still exist even if the lawsuit (limiting federal tax credits) is successful?\u201d\n\nYou won\u2019t have much choice soon, Patricia, because grandfathered plans are in the process of disappearing. You will need to switch to an ACA-compliant plan eventually, as we noted above.\n\nNow, as to the subsidy: Even though Nevada is using the federal marketplace, it is considered a state-run exchange because we\u2019ve kept control over the plans offered and how administration of the marketplace is funded. So you\u2019re safe.\n\nAlso, Patricia, no insurer can rate, underwrite or deny you a plan based on your pre-existing condition, whether you buy on or off of the exchange.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They could put off the inevitable for only so long.
