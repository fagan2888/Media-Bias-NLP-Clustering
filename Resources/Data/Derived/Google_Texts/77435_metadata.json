Zucker and the youngsters were on hand to kick off construction of the Zucker Family Graduate Education Center, which will offer master\u2019s degrees and doctorates in STEM disciplines that aren\u2019t available in the region right now. The $21.5 million expansion on the former Navy base is expected to start enrollment in time for the fall 2016 semester.\n\n\u201cAnd what really makes me happy about this is it\u2019s going to be here, and it\u2019s going to offer opportunities to people just like you, when you become older, so that you can go and get graduate degrees in engineering, perhaps computer science,\u201d Zucker said.\n\nHer remarks capped more than two years of planning. Zucker and her family pledged $5 million toward the cost of the new center in mid-2012. At that announcement, a commemorative video showed that Jerry and Anita Zucker \u2014 he a business-minded scientist, she a schoolteacher \u2014 lived in a trailer as a young married couple. When he died of brain cancer in 2008, The InterTech Group Inc. was a global manufacturing conglomerate that remains one of the largest private companies in the country.\n\nIn October, Forbes Magazine estimated her net worth at $2.4 billion. Through it all, her passion for education has never wavered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been involved in education since I moved here in 1978,\u201d Zucker said after Thursday\u2019s kickoff event. \u201cIn the mid-\u201990s, I was vice president of education for the chamber of commerce, and we did some surveying of the business community. I\u2019ve known for \u2026 almost 20 years that graduate levels of education, especially in engineering and computer science, were missing from this region.\u201d\n\nShe said one reason that Clemson\u2019s funding proposal stood out is that the school agreed to collaborate with the College of Charleston, The Citadel, the Medical University and Trident Technical College.\n\n\u201cThe way I see it, it\u2019s the best way we can work, when we can all work together,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe in that. I believe in collaboration, and it\u2019s something our family urged to happen.\u201d\n\nAnother reason: \u201cThey came to me and they\u2019re bringing something our region doesn\u2019t have. It\u2019s really critical. It will answer a huge need.\u201d\n\nThe Clemson donation is among several big education-based philanthropic gifts from Zucker. A few motnhs ago, she gave $4 million to the School of Education at The Citadel. Around the same time, she pledged $5 million to the University of Florida, her alma mater, to set up a program to improve early childhood education.\n\nIn 2012, she announced a $5 million gift for the University of South Carolina to help launch the Zucker Institute for Aerospace Innovation and an endowed professorship within the McNair Center.\n\nThe timing isn\u2019t coincidental, she said.\n\n\u201cWhy now? First of all, over the last several years, a lot of the higher-ed funding at the state level has dropped dramatically, OK,\u201d she said. \u201cWe as a state dropped dramatically in our investments in higher ed. And I\u2019m the kind of person who just believes that every door can be opened for anyone if you give them the opportunity and access to education.\u201d\n\nThe donations also have a botton-line element.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an employer as well,\u201d said Zucker, whose company opened an aerospace parts plant in North Charleston about two years ago. \u201cI am an educator. However, being an employer, I want to make certain as a state we\u2019re able to meet the needs of those companies that want to locate here. We\u2019ve changed, and it can\u2019t be about the same companies that were here 30 years ago. The world isn\u2019t the same. ... And we can\u2019t meet the need without the educa-tion.\u201d\n\nContact John McDermott at 937-5572.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "For Charleston\u2019s Anita Zucker, it\u2019s still all about education, Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nJohn McDermott, \r\nJohn McDermott, Anita Zucker,Charleston,Citadel baseball,Clemson,Clemson Restoration Institute,College of Charleston,Education,higher education,InterTech Group,MUSC,Navy base,North Charleston,STEM,Trident Technical College", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Years removed from the classroom, InterTech Group CEO Anita Zucker still describes herself as an educator.", "title": "For Charleston\u2019s Anita Zucker, it\u2019s still all about education", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150118/150119515/for-charleston-8217-s-anita-zucker-it-8217-s-still-all-about-education", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150118/PC05/150119515/AR/0/AR-150119515.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150118/PC05/150119515/AR/0/AR-150119515.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Years removed from the classroom, InterTech Group CEO Anita Zucker still describes herself as an educator.", "title": "For Charleston\u2019s Anita Zucker, it\u2019s still all about education", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150118/PC05/150119515/AR/0/AR-150119515.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150119515}}, "keywords": "For Charleston\u2019s Anita Zucker, it\u2019s still all about education , Business-Local, \r\nBusiness-LocalFP LatestNews, \r\nJohn McDermott, \r\nJohn McDermott, Anita Zucker,Charleston,Citadel baseball,Clemson,Clemson Restoration Institute,College of Charleston,Education,higher education,InterTech Group,MUSC,Navy base,North Charleston,STEM,Trident Technical College", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-18T08:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-01-16T15:42:00Z", "author": "John McDermott"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Years removed from the classroom, InterTech Group CEO Anita Zucker still describes herself as an educator."}, "article_summary": "Zucker and the youngsters were on hand to kick off construction of the Zucker Family Graduate Education Center, which will offer master\u2019s degrees and doctorates in STEM disciplines that aren\u2019t available in the region right now.\nYears removed from the classroom, InterTech Group CEO Anita Zucker still describes herself as an educator.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been involved in education since I moved here in 1978,\u201d Zucker said after Thursday\u2019s kickoff event.\nZucker and her family pledged $5 million toward the cost of the new center in mid-2012.\nAt that announcement, a commemorative video showed that Jerry and Anita Zucker \u2014 he a business-minded scientist, she a schoolteacher \u2014 lived in a trailer as a young married couple."}
