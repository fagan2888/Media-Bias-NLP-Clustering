However, the bill faces a steep uphill battle in the House, which has far-right conservatives unwilling to consider any form of Medicaid expansion because of its ties to the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe last-minute bill was stitched together by Senate lawmakers on Thursday after completely transforming a minor health care bill in the House that would have only allocated more funding for studying the so-called Medicaid gap population.\n\n\u201cAnother year is a long time to do the right thing. The golf clubs and fishing poles can wait,\u201d said Sen. Jim Guthrie, R-Pocatello. \u201cI spoke to my cows and they miss me. But they\u2019ll wait another day.\u201d\n\nThe eight senators who voted against the proposal argued that they could not support a plan that involved relying on the federal government. It\u2019s a sentiment that has been used in the Republican-dominated Idaho Legislature for years to reject any proposals for Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cNot one of those who left bloody tracks in the snow at Valley Forge did so over free health care. It\u2019s not a right,\u201d said Sen. Jim Rice, R-Caldwell, who said he voted in favor of the bill reluctantly.\n\nEarlier that day, protesters laid floral funeral wreaths in front of the House and Senate chambers as part of a demonstration to \u201cclose the gap.\u201d\n\nLawmakers have been floating possible solutions to addressing the so-called Medicaid gap population in the final days of the session, but the Republican supermajority has failed to find a consensus. Two proposals were passed in the House on Wednesday that called for studies on the topic, but they immediately faced opposition by the next day.\n\nFive Republican lawmakers then announced they regretted voting on the proposals during a House Health and Welfare meeting. \u201cWhat I am unwilling to tolerate is inaction,\u201d said Rep. Christy Perry, R-Nampa.\n\nThe group then promised to vote against any bills that come through the House Health and Welfare Committee during the 2017 Legislature until a proposal emerges that address the gap population. However, whether they have to follow through with that promise will be up in the air until the House votes on the pending Medicaid waiver on Friday.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Rep. John Rusche, also a committee member, praised the group\u2019s sentiments.\n\nRusche, who has publicly criticized the GOP\u2019s inaction on Democratic-backed bills throughout the session, then said he would ask Gov. C.L. \u201cButch\u201d Otter to call a special session to get Medicaid expansion passed.\n\nHe acknowledged, however, that Otter would likely deny the request.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Idaho House lawmakers on Thursday punted on approving a proposal to allow the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to apply for a Medicaid waiver to provide health insurance for people who have incomes below 100 percent of the federal poverty line.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Idaho House lawmakers on Thursday punted on approving a proposal to allow the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to apply for a Medicaid waiver to provide health insurance for people who have incomes below 100 percent of the federal poverty line.", "title": "Idaho\u2019s health care gap dominates last days of Legislature", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/24/idahos-health-care-gap-dominates-last-days-of-legi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/24/medicaid_expansion_failure.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/03/24/medicaid_expansion_failure.jpeg", "description": "Idaho House lawmakers on Thursday punted on approving a proposal to allow the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare to apply for a Medicaid waiver to provide health insurance for people who have inco", "card": "summary", "title": "Idaho\u2019s health care gap dominates last days of Legislature"}, "Author": "KIMBERLEE KRUESI", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cNot one of those who left bloody tracks in the snow at Valley Forge did so over free health care.\nFive Republican lawmakers then announced they regretted voting on the proposals during a House Health and Welfare meeting.\nThe group then promised to vote against any bills that come through the House Health and Welfare Committee during the 2017 Legislature until a proposal emerges that address the gap population.\nThe last-minute bill was stitched together by Senate lawmakers on Thursday after completely transforming a minor health care bill in the House that would have only allocated more funding for studying the so-called Medicaid gap population.\nIt\u2019s a sentiment that has been used in the Republican-dominated Idaho Legislature for years to reject any proposals for Medicaid expansion."}
