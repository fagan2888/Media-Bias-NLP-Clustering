Brands charge customers directly, with Spring retaining a small fee.\n\nYou won\u2019t see any customer reviews and opinions\u2013the presentation is controlled by the brand itself, the way it is in physical stores.\n\n\u201cWe are not a social platform,\u201d said David Tisch, co-founder of Jello Labs. \u201cOn every other platform, users follower users.\u201d On Spring, shoppers follow brands.\n\nThe app is launching with storefronts from 70 brands, including Carolina Herrera and Nicole Miller, as well as brands started by startups such as Warby Parker. Mr. Tisch said he expects to have 450 brands on the app in January.\n\nMr. Tisch is a prolific investor who previously ran the New York Techstars accelerator program and has backed hundreds of consumer and other startups via his firm BoxGroup. He said running a startup is very different from investing.\n\nFor an investor, it\u2019s all about the broad strategy, but when running a company, all the details matter.\n\n\u201cAs an investor you meet the CEO, the founder, and you never see the customer service reps,\u201d Mr. Tisch said. \u201c[Now] I\u2019ll go more to my [portfolio] companies\u2019 offices.\u201d\n\nJello Labs raised $7.5 million in its Series A round earlier this year from some 40 investors, including Thrive Capital, a New York venture firm that co-led the deal with Mr. Tisch\u2019s BoxGroup.\n\nWrite to Yuliya Chernova at yuliya.chernova@wsj.com.
