We don\u2019t want to be one of those. We are working diligently to keep our hospital financially viable and to continue to provide the benefits,\u201d West said.\n\nThe hospital had many achievements during the recent fiscal year that ended September 30, 2015.\n\nThe MASH program to encourage more young people to enter medical professions has gained popularity, West said. A hospitalist program was begun. A residency program was established. The hospital took over management of the Murphy Clinic. A new surgeon was hired.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of things going for us. We had one of our regular revenue-producing years. That particular year patient revenue was $49.7 million, and with other revenue was $50.2 million,\u201d West said.\n\nThe hospital was set back by deductions from revenue. There \u201ccontractual allowances\u201d are the differences between what the hospital charges Medicare, Medicaid, Blue Cross and other insurers to provide a service, and the amount those entities actually pay. The payments are usually far less than what the hospital charges, West said.\n\n\u201cSometimes we can negotiate, but most of the time it is non-negotiable,\u201d West said.\n\nThe difference is a \u201ccontractual write-off.\u201d Write-offs in the past fiscal year were $25.7 million. Bad debt expense of $2 million was also written-off. The hospital is also required by law because of its not-for-profit status to provide a certain amount of free care, which was $601,000.\n\n\u201cSo we had a total deduction out of our $50 million of $28.3 million. The remainder is what we have to operate off of,\u201d West said.\n\nThe city-owned hospital paid its 229 full-time and part-time employees $11,719,987 last year, which with benefits totaled closer to $14 million, West said.\n\n\u201cExpenses exceeded that $25 million. But our depreciation expenses coming from the depreciation that we take on the new hospital is $2.6 million. When you take that off the amount less expenses, we actually had a negative $138,750. We felt that was a fairly good year,\u201d West said.\n\nThe hospital was also impacted by \u201ctake backs\u201d from the government.\n\n\u201cOur State Medicaid decided that the process we have used to bill and collect money in the labor and delivery area has been incorrect for past five years. We were asked to pay $1.5 million back last summer, so we paid $1.5 million back. We also had a new audit company that came on board and cleaned up the books and adjusted some of the payback for several years, and that amounted to another half-million,\u201d West said.\n\nThe hospital is reducing capital expenditures, payroll and supplies \u201cto get where we want to be by the end of the fiscal year\u201d in September, West said.\n\nA consulting group will help Magnolia Regional Medical Center develop a plan to \u201cstay viable,\u201d West said.\n\n\u201cWe provide a lot of services to this community and we want to be here for many years to come,\u201d West said.\n\nMargaret West, chief executive officer of the Magnolia Regional Medical Center, reviews the past year at the city-owned hospital during her annual report to the Magnolia, Arkansas City Council, Monday, April 25, 2016. magnoliareporter.com video.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Magnolia Reporter - Magnolia, Arkansas News", "description": "Health care is changing, and it has created difficult times for small, rural hospitals, Margaret West told the Magnolia City Council on Monday.", "title": "City Council: (With video) MRMC's West talks about hospital's financial condition", "url": "http://www.magnoliareporter.com/news_and_business/local_news/article_e505ee60-0be1-11e6-8f91-a75b8666946b.html", "image": {"width": 480, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/magnoliareporter.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/b3/4b3811d6-0be2-11e6-91cc-1fc585dfd1d0/571fbcc92341e.preview.jpg?resize=480%2C360", "height": 360}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "description": "Health care is changing, and it has created difficult times for small, rural hospitals, Margaret West told the Magnolia City Council on Monday.", "fb": {"app_id": 240142449451687}, "keywords": "margaret west,magnolia regional medical center,magnolia city council,affordable care act,medicare medicaid,april 26 2016,local_news", "google-site-verification": "j8e2txelFw-OcuofxHXFP4WKr7__yaGYzMY55hOw3yk", "news_keywords": "margaret west,magnolia regional medical center,magnolia city council,affordable care act,medicare medicaid,april 26 2016,local_news"}, "article_summary": "A consulting group will help Magnolia Regional Medical Center develop a plan to \u201cstay viable,\u201d West said.\nThat particular year patient revenue was $49.7 million, and with other revenue was $50.2 million,\u201d West said.\nWest, chief executive officer of Magnolia Regional Medical Center, discussed those problems as they relate to the city-owned hospital during her annual report to the council.\nHealth care is changing, and it has created difficult times for small, rural hospitals, Margaret West told the Magnolia City Council on Monday.\nThe city-owned hospital paid its 229 full-time and part-time employees $11,719,987 last year, which with benefits totaled closer to $14 million, West said."}
