The penalties will increase to $325 or 2% of individuals' incomes, whichever is higher, for those who do not have insurance in 2015 (California Healthline, 2/20). The penalty will increase again in 2016, to $695 or 2.5% of household income, whichever is higher.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers have called for a repeal of the mandate through a fast-track budget process called reconciliation (Howell, Washington Times, 9/15).\n\nCBO Estimate Details\n\nAccording to CBO's estimates, government health departments would save about $311 billion over 10 years if the individual mandate were repealed.\n\nMost of the savings would come from fewer U.S. residents seeking insurance subsidies through the ACA (The Hill, 9/15). If the individual mandate were repealed, CBO estimated that the federal government over the next decade would spend about:\n\n$200 billion less on Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (Washington Times, 9/15); and\n\n$110 billion less on subsidies for individuals purchasing coverage through the health insurance exchanges.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government would lose about $6 billion in revenue from penalty fees paid by individuals who lack insurance, resulting in a net savings of about $305 billion.\n\nHowever, CBO noted that repealing the mandate could cause health insurance premiums to increase by 20%.\n\nIn addition, CBO said repealing the mandate could raise the number of uninsured U.S. residents by about 14 million.
