That\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\nIn October, just 536 Georgians were able to successfully sign up on the troublesome online health insurance marketplace set up for citizens to enroll for coverage, he said.\n\nHudgens, an outspoken critic of Obamacare, spoke at the Garlic Clove in Evans to a group of about 50 people during a CSRA Republican Women\u2019s Club meeting. He talked about what Georgians can expect when the highly-debated health care act kicks in Jan. 1.\n\nHudgens said premiums will dramatically increase with provisions for pre-existing conditions, additional mandates for increased coverage and an age criteria that he said hurts younger people. Hudgens anticipates they could see their policies increase by about 200 percent.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to lower the prices for the elderly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to raise the prices for the young folks.\u201d\n\nYounger people, in return, will likely pay the fine rather than the higher cost of coverage, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen they opt out, the dynamics of the whole scheme will not work,\u201d he said.\n\nLast month, Hudgens predicted that up to 400,000 Georgians who buy their own insurance could have their policies canceled or modified because of the act.\n\nHudgens cited a recent lawsuit filed by Oklahoma against the federal government, alleging that the law states that the only individuals eligible for a subsidy are those who live in states where there is a state-based exchange.\n\nGeorgia and 25 other states have opted not to set up their own exchanges, leaving that up to federal government.\n\nHudgens said he agrees with Oklahoma\u2019s interpretation of the law, but Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens decided not to involve Georgia in Oklahoma\u2019s legal battle.\n\nHudgens added that if the act goes into effect as is, it will lead to rationing of care, higher co-pays, larger deductibles and a drop in the network of doctors available to patients.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very passionate because I believe that Obamacare, if it is fully implemented, will destroy free enterprise in this country,\u201d Hudgens said with applause from the audience. \u201cThe whole thing, I think, is designed to run the insurance companies out of business and go to a single-carrier system, which would be socialized medicine.\u201d\n\nAt the beginning of his speech, Hudgens also addressed comments he made back in August at a Floyd County Republican meeting in which he told the crowd that his department would do \u201ceverything in our power to be an obstructionist\u201d to Obamacare.\n\nHis quote, caught on video, then went viral.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I was being videotaped and that got on the Internet,\u201d he said. \u201cI never received so many nasty e-mails. I\u2019ve been told that they hope I die. I\u2019ve been told that they hope my children had cancer, just all kinds of things.\u201d\n\nThe group congregated at the Evans restaurant included local political figures both holding office and running for election.\n\n\u201cWhen we Americans begin to hurt from this, and there are some hurting, we\u2019re going to see a change,\u201d said state Sen. Bill Jackson, of Appling. \u201cThis thing is going to fall on its face I really believe.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken, Jenna Martin", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "Fielding questions on the Affordable Care Act from local Republicans, Ralph Hudgens was prompted to ask his own question: \"If this is so good for the people, then why do you have to penalize somebody for not signing up?\"", "title": "Georgia insurance commissioner Ralph Hudgens blasts health care act at event", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/2013-11-13/georgia-insurance-commissioner-ralph-hudgens-blasts-health-care-act-event", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/12811290.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3bbf\"", "article_summary": "He talked about what Georgians can expect when the highly-debated health care act kicks in Jan. 1.\nLast month, Hudgens predicted that up to 400,000 Georgians who buy their own insurance could have their policies canceled or modified because of the act.\nGeorgia and 25 other states have opted not to set up their own exchanges, leaving that up to federal government.\nHudgens said he agrees with Oklahoma\u2019s interpretation of the law, but Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens decided not to involve Georgia in Oklahoma\u2019s legal battle.\nThat\u2019s not the case.\u201dIn October, just 536 Georgians were able to successfully sign up on the troublesome online health insurance marketplace set up for citizens to enroll for coverage, he said."}
