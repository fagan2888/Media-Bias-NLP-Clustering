His plans were foiled, though, in part because his 27-year-old daughter and her fianc\u00e9 moved back home about two years ago.\n\nGrey area\n\nThough he tried to make it work, Schuyler, 64, said he couldn't afford to pay $940 each month for the catastrophic insurance he bought for himself and his wife on the Covered California marketplace, plus another $1,500 a month for his daughter's expenses. (She's not working, he said, and he's covering her doctor's fees, phone bill, car insurance, gas costs and spending money.)\n\nSchuyler said he was denied premium assistance based on his income \u2013 even though it doesn't reflect the amount he spends on his daughter each month. He said he didn't think it was possible to claim his daughter or her fianc\u00e9 on his taxes.\n\nFor all those reasons, he and his wife are still uninsured; he's waiting to enroll in Medicare next year.\n\n\"It's extremely frustrating that I kind of looked forward to this being the answer,\" Schuyler told Impatient. \"I don\u2019t know if anyone else has fallen into the grey area or not.\"\n\nRELATED: What Obamacare? Some Californians choosing to stay uninsured\n\n'Surprisingly common'\n\nI took this question to George Brandes, director of health care programs at Jackson Hewitt tax service in Nashville. How common is it for adult children to move home, and unintentionally alter their parent\u2019s ability to purchase insurance, I asked him. And is there anything Peter, and others in his situation, can do?\n\n\"It is surprisingly common and has a couple of impacts,\" Brandes told me. Roughly three in 10 adults, ages 25-34, moved in with their parents at some point during the recent recession, and these so-called \"boomerang children\" are disproportionately uninsured, he wrote in an Oct. 2013 publication on the topic.\n\nSome possible solutions:\n\nIf Schuyler and his wife live close to the poverty level, then his daughter and her fianc\u00e9 could be considered part of his \"Medicaid household,\" which could push all the household members into an income range that would make them eligible for Medi-Cal, Brandes said. Medi-Cal enrollment is year-round, so the whole family could access coverage through the state\u2019s Medicaid system immediately.\n\nBut that's probably not a possibility for Schuyler, who makes enough money that he and his wife did not qualify for a premium assistance tax credit. But if Schuyler added his daughter and her fianc\u00e9 as tax dependents on his 2014 tax return (assuming they have little or no additional income) it might make them all eligible for tax credits on the insurance exchange, and might make insurance coverage more affordable, Brandes said.\n\nIf they pursue that path, Brandes continued, then their first step should be to speak with an enrollment counselor, to determine if there's been a \"qualifying life event\" that would allow them to enroll in subsidized insurance now, even though the open enrollment season has ended, and won't reopen until the fall. They should also speak with a tax advisor about the potential tax implications of claiming his daughter and her fianc\u00e9, he said.\n\nWhat kind of tax implications? For example, if Schuyler adds the two as dependents \u2013 and then they don\u2019t buy insurance \u2013 then the whole household could be subject to the ACA tax penalty, which this year is $95 per uninsured member or 1% of your household\u2019s taxable income, whichever is greater.\n\nHas your adult child moving back home affected your ability to purchase health insurance?
