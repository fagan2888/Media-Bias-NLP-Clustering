Here, in order from least unhealthy to most unhealthy, are the eight healthcare jobs that made the list.\n\nRadiologists (No. 24 on the full BI list): Radiology departments can expose workers to radiation as well as infectious diseases. These employees also spend a lot of time sitting.\n\nRadiology departments can expose workers to radiation as well as infectious diseases. These employees also spend a lot of time sitting. Nuclear medicine technologists (No. 23): These workers also get exposed to radiation and infectious disease, as well as toxic contaminants.\n\nThese workers also get exposed to radiation and infectious disease, as well as toxic contaminants. Critical care nurses (No. 21): Nurses are at risk for exposure to infectious diseases, exposure to contaminants and radiation, as well.

Anesthesiologists, nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants (No. 3): Again, these workers face exposure to radiation and contaminants, as well as infections and diseases.\n\nThese health risks, combined with the fact that healthcare workers suffer from chronic lifestyle-related diseases like diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure at only slightly lower rates than the general population, mean that healthcare workers can face unique wellness challenges. In addition, they are at significantly higher risk for hepatitis C than the general population. They face numerous physical hazards as well, with a recent analysis determining that nursing assistants are more likely to be injured on the job than construction workers.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Business Insider article\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHealthcare workers at significantly higher risk for hepatitis C infection\n\nWorkplace danger: Nursing assistants suffer more physical injuries than construction workers\n\nTo take care of patients, first take care of yourself and your staff\n\nNew nurses at higher risk for workplace injury\n\nOSHA doubles down on efforts to curb nurse injuries\n\nWorkplace violence is on the rise and nursing staff are in particular danger", "article_metadata": {"description": "Anesthesiologists\u00a0have the most unhealthy healthcare job in the nation,\u00a0according to\u00a0a survey of jobs across muliple industries, including healthcare.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Anesthesiologists\u00a0have the most unhealthy healthcare job in the nation,\u00a0according to\u00a0a survey of jobs across muliple industries, including healthcare.", "title": "8 most unhealthy healthcare jobs", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/8-most-unhealthy-healthcare-jobs/2015-11-04", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "critical care nurses,disease exposure,healthcare jobs,healthcare workers,HR & Workforce Management,Radiologists,workplace wellness", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "HR & Workforce Management"}, "article_summary": "Anesthesiologists have the most unhealthy healthcare job in the nation, according to a survey of jobs across muliple industries, including healthcare.\nHere, in order from least unhealthy to most unhealthy, are the eight healthcare jobs that made the list.\n21): Nurses are at risk for exposure to infectious diseases, exposure to contaminants and radiation, as well.\n24 on the full BI list): Radiology departments can expose workers to radiation as well as infectious diseases.\nNurses are at risk for exposure to infectious diseases, exposure to contaminants and radiation, as well."}
