The complete NCAA tournament field of 68 will be set at 6 p.m. ET, and the race for the national title will begin. Before the bracket is released, there's still a lot of basketball left to be played with major conference tournaments concluding this weekend, including No. 1 Kentucky's bid to stay unbeaten. The final weekend represents the last chance for teams to earn their way into the big dance. Those that have their bubble burst Sunday night will have to wait until next season. How does the field look right now? Check out our latest bracketology projection.\n\n2. Number nerds have an extra reason to geek out this Pi Day\n\nOn Saturday 3.14.15 at exactly 9:26:53 in the morning (with a repeat performance 12 hours later), mathematicians will marvel at how all the digits line up.

The U.S. is about to hit its debt limit again\n\nThe federal government's debt limit suspension expires Sunday, which means the Treasury will start taking \"extraordinary measures\" to keep the country running and from defaulting on its debt, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told lawmakers this week. Those measures include a halt to new investments in federal employee pension funds and a moratorium on deposits from state and local governments. In the past, Congress would simply raise the amount of money the government is allowed to borrow. But the cap, also known as the \"debt ceiling,\" has become a contentious issue in recent years, leading to Congress suspending the law.\n\nTreasury Secretary Jacob Lew testifies on Capitol Hill in Washington in February.

Americans vie for 'Nobel Prize of Teaching'\n\nThree U.S. teachers are on a short list of educators from around the world in line to win $1 million for their efforts to promote \"global citizenship.\" The prize, to be announced Sunday in Dubai, has been dubbed \"the Nobel Prize for Teaching.\" The three veteran teachers live in Maine, Massachusetts and New York City.\n\nStephen Ritz teaches in New York City\u2019s South Bronx, the poorest Congressional District in America.

Special Obamacare sign-ups start Sunday after tax form mistake\n\nSunday marks the start of a new special Obamacare enrollment period for people who weren't aware they have to pay a penalty at tax time if they don't have health insurance. About 800,000 consumers who purchased health insurance on the federal exchange and received tax credits were contacted last month because a tax form sent by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services contained a mistake in the benchmark plan used to calculate how much tax they might owe. There's no word from officials on how many corrected tax forms have been sent out.\n\nThe special Obamacare sign-up period that starts Sunday is available to those among the estimated 6 million people who will owe a penalty for not having insurance in 2014 and attest that they first learned of the tax penalty after the open enrollment period ended Feb. 15.
