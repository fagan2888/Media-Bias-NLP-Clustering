Renee Ellmers (R-NC)\n\nConservatives aren\u2019t very happy with Rep. Renee Ellmers this week. Over the course of just a few days, the Republican congresswoman from North Carolina has become an unlikely symbol for Republicans\u2019 brewing divisions over abortion policy.\n\nEllmers is being accused of betraying her party \u2014 several articles published on the right-wing Red State accuse her of being \u201cworse than a Democrat\u201d and \u201ctwo-faced\u201d \u2014 for thwarting a proposed 20-week abortion ban that was scheduled to come up for a vote this week. On Thursday afternoon, anti-abortion activists Jill Stanek and Patrick Mahoney held a protest outside of Ellmers\u2019 office, urging activists to stand against \u201cCongressman Ellmers\u2019 blockage of a bill to protect babies destined for death by abortion.\u201d\n\nThe GOP-controlled House was expecting to easily pass the so-called \u201cPain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act\u201d on Thursday. Although President Obama has already issued a veto threat, abortion opponents wanted to hold a largely symbolic vote on the bill on the 42nd anniversary of Roe v. Wade. But, after Ellmers took her name off the bill amid concerns about the legislation\u2019s narrow exception for rape victims, GOP aides started worrying about the political pitfalls of putting forth an abortion measure that female lawmakers might not support. Party leaders pulled the bill at the last minute, swapping it out for a different piece of anti-choice legislation.\n\nThe House still passed the abortion restriction they subbed in, which restricts insurance coverage for the procedure and which the President has also pledged to veto. But the political damage has been done. In headlines across the country, the move is being described as \u201cembarrassing\u201d and a \u201cfiasco.\u201d It\u2019s providing clear evidence that the Republican Party is unsure how to move forward on contentious issues of rape, particularly after callous comments regarding rape victims\u2019 access to abortion became a sticking point in the 2012 elections.\n\nNow, plenty of abortion opponents are upset, specifically blaming Ellmers for undermining their agenda. \u201cWe are sad to report to you that Congresswoman Renee Ellmers has betrayed the pro-life community,\u201d the North Carolina Values Coalition wrote on its website. \u201cHer actions this week are both bewildering and traitorous.\u201d\n\nFor their protest against the congresswomen, Stanek and Mahoney partnered with Students for Life and gathered a group of about fifty teenagers at the entrance to the Longworth House Office Building after the day\u2019s main March for Life events. The adults there were on message \u2014 one man who asked not to be named said that Rep. Ellmers \u201cran on being pro-life and abandoned the movement\u201d \u2014 but the teens weren\u2019t as sure. When asked which lawmaker they were there to meet with, a group of five young people said they didn\u2019t know, but they wanted to demonstrate that Millennials care about life.\n\n\u201cI have no idea,\u201d a teenage boy said in response to a question about which member of Congress he was there to protest. \u201cLike a young woman?\u201d He called over another protester to help clarify, who said that they were paying a visit to all female lawmakers that afternoon.\n\nJill Stanek is more focused, and she\u2019s livid at Ellmers. On her website this week, Stanek floated the idea that the congresswoman could be be a pro-choice mole.\n\nIn practice, however, Renee Ellmers is hardly a supporter of the reproductive rights movement. \u201cI believe in the sanctity of human life and believe that life begins at conception. I am Pro-Life,\u201d she posted on her campaign website in 2010. \u201cI have gained the wisdom of knowing that every life is a precious gift from God and it is not for us to judge its worth, deny its beginning or determine its end.\u201d\n\nA self-declared \u201cproduct of the Tea Party,\u201d the congresswoman has a long history of voting to curtail access to abortion. She earned a 100 percent rating from the National Right To Life Committee last year. While she\u2019s been in office, she has voted to define life as beginning at conception, to ban Obamacare plans from covering abortion, to defund Planned Parenthood, and to prevent low-income women from using their insurance coverage for abortion. In 2013, she co-sponsored the same \u201cPain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act\u201d that Republicans attempted to recycle for Thursday\u2019s vote.\n\nIn light of her record, pro-choice advocates are not exactly ready to embrace Ellmers as one of their own \u2014 regardless of the role she\u2019s playing in the emerging rift among conservatives over abortion restrictions and rape exceptions.\n\n\u201cDespite the drama of the last 24 hours, it\u2019s very clear that this entire mutiny has been motivated by optics,\u201d Marcy Stech, the press secretary at EMILY\u2019s List, told ThinkProgress, pointing out that Ellmers doesn\u2019t actually oppose the substance of the proposed abortion ban. \u201cIf anything, I think Republican women can be credited to smarter political strategy. But at the end of the day, they still support it and promise to vote on it.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the night before the scheduled vote, Ellmers even said she planned on voting for the 20-week abortion ban. \u201cTo clear up any misinformation, I will be voting tomorrow to support H.R. 36 \u2013 The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protect Act Resources bill. I have and will continue to be a strong defender of the prolife community,\u201d she posted on Facebook.\n\nThat didn\u2019t placate pro-life groups, who are still angry that Ellmers was reportedly working behind the scenes to persuade her Republican colleagues to oppose the legislation as it\u2019s currently written. One of the protesters outside Ellmers\u2019 office said that the lead-up to Thursday\u2019s vote was \u201ca major moment where we were winning the argument\u201d and Ellmers ruined it. \u201cThe main message is that we\u2019re not going to tolerate people abandoning out values,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the other side of the issue, reproductive rights advocates are glad the internal political fights may be helping stall GOP efforts to pass anti-abortion legislation. Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said in a statement that it\u2019s \u201cencouraging that some politicians are starting to recognize that it is a political vulnerability to attack women\u2019s access to abortion and other health care.\u201d\n\nRep. Louise Slaughter (D-NY), who co-chairs the Pro-Choice Caucus, echoed those sentiments. \u201cWhat I would like to think is happening over there is that a lot of people are saying, we\u2019ve been after this for 40 years now, and let\u2019s stop and work on things so we can draw more people to our cause,\u201d the congresswoman told ThinkProgress in an interview. \u201cThis is driving more people away. I really believe that.\u201d\n\nSlaughter said she believes Thursday\u2019s infighting was such a \u201cmajor humiliation\u201d for Republicans that she wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the 20-week abortion ban never comes up for a vote at all.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Ellmers told reporters that the conflict over the legislation was \u201cunfortunate,\u201d but stood behind her initial critiques regarding the bill. She said that while she supports banning abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, she still thinks Republicans should tweak the rape exception so that victims of sexual assault are not required to report to law enforcement officials. She acknowledged that the first time she voted for the legislation, she didn\u2019t realize the rape exception was written that way.\n\nEllmers \u2014 who has previously spoken publicly about the need for the GOP to address its \u201cwar on women\u201d image by \u201cgetting the point across that we care\u201d \u2014 said that the GOP-controlled Congress needs to make sure its policies aren\u2019t viewed as \u201charsh\u201d by women and young people. \u201cWhen we come off as harsh and judgmental, we stop that conversation and we\u2019ve got to learn to be doing a better job,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Pro-life groups are calling her a traitor -- but pro-choice advocates aren't exactly ready to embrace her, either.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Pro-life groups are calling her a traitor -- but pro-choice advocates aren't exactly ready to embrace her, either.", "title": "Meet The GOP Congresswoman Who\u2019s Tearing Her Party Apart Over Abortion", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/01/22/3614317/renee-ellmers-abortion-gop/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AP992784869948.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pro-life groups are calling her a traitor -- but pro-choice advocates aren't exactly ready to embrace her, either.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AP992784869948-321x214.jpg", "title": "Meet The GOP Congresswoman Who\u2019s Tearing Her Party Apart Over Abortion", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AP992784869948.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/AP992784869948.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-22T16:22:18+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Health Meet The GOP Congresswoman Who\u2019s Tearing Her Party Apart Over Abortion CREDIT: AP Photo/Karl B DeBlaker Rep.
