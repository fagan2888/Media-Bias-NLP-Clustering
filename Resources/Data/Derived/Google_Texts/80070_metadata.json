Council of Teaching Hospitals. That\u2019s about one primary doctor for every 2,500 residents in the state, the report said.\n\nNew Jersey needs 1,000 primary care doctors by 2020 to meet the demands for service of the Affordable Care Act and offset the number of anticipated retirees who will need care, according to the report.\n\nThe physician shortage also is fueled by the fact that medical students and residents are choosing not to practice in New Jersey because of the state\u2019s high cost of living, expensive malpractice insurance and insufficient reimbursement from private and governmental insurance plans, said Deborah Briggs, the council\u2019s president and CEO.\n\nMost doctors don\u2019t see the Affordable Care Act as a gold rush. Quite the opposite, said Ruth Schulze, president of the Medical Society of New Jersey. Doctors fear the demand for more treatment will exacerbate the problem of inadequate reimbursements, she said.\n\n\u201cWe want to stay in medicine, but we need fair compensation to do that and provide appropriate care,\u201d said Schulze, an OB/GYN in Bergen and Passaic counties. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government fully understands that.\u201d\n\nOne proposed solution to the physician shortfall is to give advanced practice nurses more autonomy. APNs, also known as nurse practitioners, are licensed specialists who can treat patients and write some prescriptions with limited oversight from a doctor.\n\nHowever a bill pending in the state Legislature, which would give APNs even more autonomy and authority to write prescriptions, is expected to face stiff opposition from doctors when the proposal comes up for debate, according to the state medical society, as well as doctor and nursing associations.\n\nHospitals and federally-qualified health centers, which provide care for many low-income families, are \u201cgrabbing APNs left and right,\u201d said Pat Barnett, CEO for the New Jersey State Nurses Association. \u201cThey see them as a great way of providing excellent care.\u201d\n\nThe number of nurse practitioners in the state is on the rise, from 5,500 last year to 6,250 this year, a 13.6 percent increase, Barnett said. \u201cI think APNs will go a long way to addressing some of the shortage issues and how we deliver health care in different settings.\u201d\n\nBriggs said she hopes the APN issue doesn\u2019t turn into a turf war. \u201cInstead of worrying about pitting advanced practice nurses against primary care physicians, it\u2019s my contention that if you look at what our needs are, we still don\u2019t have enough,\u201d she said.\n\nBriggs predicts that, in the absence of enough health care providers, some people will seek out a specialist because there are far more of them. Or, they will go to the emergency room, where New Jersey has seen a 27 percent rise in traffic from 2000 to 2010.\n\n\u201cYou will hear that people in Massachusetts couldn\u2019t find primary care doctors and they were waiting. They weren\u2019t waiting. The emergency room activity skyrocketed. People don\u2019t wait when they need care,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Susan K.
