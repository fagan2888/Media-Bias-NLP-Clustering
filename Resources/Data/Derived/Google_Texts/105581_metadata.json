Some people may have understood Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s \u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d as a pro-CIA movie, but Rodriguez assures us its depiction of waterboarding as brutal and nightmarish was \u201ctotal bullshit.\u201d Yeah, that venerable technique of \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d has been used as torture at other times in history, Rodriguez admits, including by the Nazis, the Soviets and the witch-hunters of the Spanish Inquisition. But not by the CIA. Our guys always had doctors on hand to make sure nobody died, he says. They used small amounts of water, not gallons at a time, to provoke the desired sensation that a detainee was drowning. They generally stopped the procedure after 10 seconds or so (that point is a little vague). \u201cWe waterboarded three guys,\u201d Rodriguez scoffs. \u201cGive. Me. A. Break.\u201d\n\nSimultaneously charismatic and chilling, Rodriguez is one of the stars of \u201cThe Spymasters: CIA in the Crosshairs,\u201d an addictive if perplexing documentary that premieres this weekend on Showtime. He bears little resemblance to the dozen CIA directors interviewed in the film, all the way back to Adm. Stansfield Turner (1977-81) and up to John Brennan, the current incumbent. Those guys don\u2019t all agree about everything, and a few of them clearly feel the agency has gone badly off the rails in the era of \u201cextraordinary rendition\u201d and drone warfare. But as human specimens they\u2019re all pretty much of a piece, the way archbishops or bank presidents are. In fact they reminded me of Jesuit priests, a soft-spoken, pasty-faced brotherhood of white dudes with elite educations and deep roots in the arcane national security apparatus. It\u2019s fascinating to hear them spin their self-justifying anecdotes, offer their guarded and evasive mea culpas and mouth their pseudo-sophisticated clich\u00e9s, but my general feeling is that we know even less after they\u2019re done talking than we did before.\n\nHow much do we really understand about the CIA, even after all the attention paid by novelists and screenwriters and journalists to its myths and legends? And how much do we trust the CIA to tell its own story? The answers to those questions may seem simple enough: Not much, or maybe some Rumsfeldian formula like, \u201cWe cannot know what we do not know.\u201d But the nature of the questions is not simple at all, and our ambiguous relationship to the much-loathed and much-mythologized government agency whose budget is a state secret, which has spent our tax dollars on the Bay of Pigs invasion, the overthrow of Salvador Allende, \u201cextraordinary rendition,\u201d \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d and now the secret drone war is a central conundrum of American identity and American life.\n\n\u201cThe Spymasters\u201d offers an extraordinary opportunity to explore that conundrum, by hearing numerous CIA veterans talk about their work, about the philosophy that guided them, and about the current state of the world\u2019s most infamous spy agency. Along with all 12 living CIA directors and the Mephistophelean Rodriguez, we meet the former terrorism analyst Gina Bennett, an expert on al-Qaida who was the obvious model for Jessica Chastain\u2019s \u201cZero Dark Thirty\u201d character. By her own account, Bennett destroyed her marriage through her monomaniacal CIA career, and she says that Islamic terrorism is nowhere near as big a threat to America as the measures we adopt in trying to prevent it. There are numerous startling moments of illumination in \u201cThe Spymasters,\u201d but the movie\u2019s aims, goals and methods are never entirely clear, which certainly befits its subject. Is this muckraking journalism, or something closer to a propaganda exercise or a feature-length infomercial? Is the apparent candor of all these people who spent years in an agency built on lies, disinformation and \u201cplausible deniability\u201d anything more than the performance of candor for political purposes?\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting that directors Jules and G\u00e9d\u00e9on Naudet \u2013 they\u2019re the French filmmaking brothers who shot that accidental video of the first plane striking the World Trade Center on 9/11 \u2013 set out to make a CIA whitewash. I\u2019m saying there\u2019s a reason why all these people agreed to talk to them, and a reason why they were allowed to shoot inside the legendary CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. Someone came to the conclusion that this movie (a co-production of Showtime and CBS News) was the right venue for a P.R. counteroffensive, and for opening the curtain on many of the disagreements within the American intelligence community: on drones, on torture, on the bad information and bad analysis that led to the Iraq war; on the summary execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, the \u201cterror sheik\u201d who was a U.S. citizen; on whether the agency\u2019s new role as a paramilitary covert army is a violation of its core mission.\n\nThose issues are contentious and undeniably important, but beneath and behind them, \u201cThe Spymasters\u201d has a running theme that varies surprisingly little from one interviewee to the next. Essentially, the point seems to be to convince us that we don\u2019t understand how hard this stuff really is, or how decent these people really are. They think really, really hard about who should disappear into black-site torture cells, and which Somali villages should be obliterated by robot bombs from above, and they wouldn\u2019t do any of it if it weren\u2019t urgently necessary to protect the homeland from attack. (Every time any government official says the word \u201chomeland,\u201d everything out of his or her mouth for 10 minutes in all directions is rendered meaningless.)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Whom to waterboard?
