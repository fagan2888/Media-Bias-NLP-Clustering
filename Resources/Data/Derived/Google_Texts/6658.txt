Spring has sprung in Washington, D.C., and President Obama’s approval rating is blooming.

According to a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday, Obama is currently enjoying his highest job-approval rating in nearly two years.

Currently, 48 percent of Americans approve of the job that the president is doing in the White House, while only 47 percent disapprove.

This is the first instance since May 2013 in which Obama’s approval rating has been higher than his disapproval rating. Though the share of Americans expressing approval of Obama reached 48 percent in December 2014, a larger percentage — 50 percent — still disapproved of the president.

Millennials are the most enthusiastic about Obama’s job as president, as 55 percent of 18-to-34-year-olds approve of the commander-in-chief.

The source of this newfound positivity for the president might the fact that Americans are increasingly optimistic about the state of the country’s economy.

The poll also found that 52 percent of Americans currently rate the U.S. economic conditions as at least somewhat good, a figure that is up 4 percentage points since February.

The survey was conducted between April 16 and 19 and involved 1,018 American adults.
