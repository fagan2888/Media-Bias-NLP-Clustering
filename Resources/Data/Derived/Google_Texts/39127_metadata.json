(David Prasad/Flickr)\n\nThis week marks the 20th anniversary of Proposition 187, a ballot measure that left a profound mark on California politics.\n\nIt was a kind of citizens\u2019 revolt in 1994 over illegal immigration, and it passed overwhelmingly with 59 percent of the vote.\n\nTo understand why Prop. 187 struck such a chord 20 years ago, you have to know what was happening in California back then. There was a sense across the country that our borders were simply out of control. It was captured in a television ad, now infamous, used by Republican Gov. Pete Wilson in his re-election campaign that year.\n\n\u201cThey keep coming,\u201d intoned the ominous voice on the commercial. \u201cTwo million illegal immigrants in California. The federal government won\u2019t stop them at the border, yet requires us to pay billions to take care of them.\u201d\n\nPete Wilson\u2019s 1994 Prop. 187 Ad\n\nIts provocative images of people streaming in from Mexico illegally helped propel Wilson to a re-election landslide. But it came at a cost to the Republican Party in California.\n\nEarlier this month I visited the border crossing featured in that commercial.\n\n\u201cThis is right in the middle of what used to be ground zero in terms of illegal immigration,\u201d says Pete Nunez. Pointing toward the south and east, he notes, \u201cMost of what you see today wasn\u2019t here 20 years ago because it was overrun by illegal immigrants. There was no fence, there were no lights. There were no cameras. So it really served as a focal point of what was wrong with immigration policy.\u201d\n\nNunez was U.S. attorney for San Diego under President Ronald Reagan and one of the chief proponents of Prop. 187.\n\n\u201cIn the narrowest sense, we wanted to implement at the state level some measures that would make it more difficult for illegal aliens to survive in the state,\u201d Nunez says. He mentions a study at the time showing how much money illegal immigration cost California.\n\n\u201cIt was in the billions of dollars and it covered everything from public schooling, medical costs, jail costs, welfare costs \u2014 all kinds of costs that would be passed down to the taxpayer.\u201d\n\nProp. 187 called for preventing undocumented immigrants from getting any public benefits, including health care and education. It required school districts to verify the immigration status of all students \u2014 and their parents.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe issue had such resonance with voters that Democrats up for re-election, like U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, were also talking tough on border security.\n\nOn election night, Prop. 187 won with 59 percent of the vote. And Stanford political science professor Gary Segura notes it was a good night for Republicans.\n\n\u201cIn 1994 we re-elected a Republican governor, Republicans controlled the lower house of the state Legislature, the Senate was relatively closely divided and the congressional delegation in the House of Representatives was exactly half Republican and half Democrat.\u201d\n\nSegura says that before 1994, Latinos were trending toward the Republican Party. Prop. 187, he says, changed everything.\n\n\u201cAfter 1994 and up through 2000, approximately 1.1 million people registered to vote in the state of California\u201d Segura notes. \u201cOne million of the 1.1 million were self-identified Hispanics or Latinos.\u201d\n\nTheir clout has helped Democrats capture every statewide office from governor on down, while giving Democrats two-thirds majorities in both houses of the Legislature.\n\nSome California Republicans insist there are no lingering effects of Prop. 187 for the GOP today. One high-ranking Republican official in California called anyone who would say that an \u201costrich.\u201d He believes Prop. 187 \u201cradicalized\u201d Latinos and other immigrants. \u201cBefore 1994, legal Mexican immigrants were among the least likely to become citizens,\u201d he said.\n\nSilicon Valley entrepreneur Ron Unz was one of the few Republicans who spoke out against Prop. 187. He says that 20 years ago most eligible immigrants didn\u2019t even bother registering to vote.\n\n\u201cFor decades the immigrant population had been growing,\u201d Unz says, \u201cwhile immigrants just hadn\u2019t been politically involved, they hadn\u2019t felt it wasn\u2019t necessary for them to take part in politics.\u201d\n\nThat, he adds, allowed them to be politically scapegoated by 187.\n\nLike many Latinos from immigrant families at that time, Lorena Gonzalez decided to get involved. She was a grad student as the 187 campaign heated up. The daughter of a farmworker from Mexico, Gonzalez says her mother pushed her toward public service.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018There are a number of things you can do. You can become an attorney, you could represent immigrants, you could go into politics, you could do any of these things to really change the way [California] looks,\u2019 \u201d Gonzalez remembers.\n\nKQED Newsroom\n\nThe Legacy of Prop. 187\n\nToday Gonzalez represents the 80th Assembly District in San Diego. Standing in Chicano Park in the working-class Barrio Logan neighborhood, she marvels at how much politics have changed since Prop. 187.\n\n\u201cThe best we could hope for, for a while there, was just to stop it and now have completely reversed it and welcomed all immigrants into our community and said we need to do something about this,\u201d Gonzalez says.\n\nAt the urging of her and nearly two dozen other Latinos in the state Legislature, California has enacted legislation allowing undocumented immigrants to obtain driver\u2019s licenses and get college loans.\n\nAnd earlier this month, the state Senate elected its first Latino president pro tem, state Sen. Kevin de Le\u00f3n, from Los Angeles. De Le\u00f3n grew up in the San Diego neighborhood now represented by Lorena Gonzalez.\n\nHis path to his current post began as a young political organizer against Prop. 187. And that experience clearly influences his thinking today.\n\n\u201cEvery kid, regardless of who they are, regardless of where they come from, regardless of what language they speak or where their parents are from or where they were born or their immigration status, deserves a fair shot to make it here ,\u201d said de Le\u00f3n at his splashy inauguration at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cWhat happened here 20 years ago in many ways is a prologue for what\u2019s happening nationwide.\u2019 Stanford political science professor Gary Segura\n\nProp. 187 never took effect in California. It was ruled unconstitutional by the federal courts. But earlier this year de Le\u00f3n authored legislation officially wiping the law\u2019s wording off the books. Gov. Jerry Brown signed it.\n\nBut the issue of illegal immigration still sparks strong feelings.\n\nThis summer, demonstrators protested the large number of unaccompanied minors entering the U.S. illegally from Central America. Angry crowds in Murrieta, just north of San Diego County, shouted\u201dU.S.A.!, U.S.A.!\u201d and blocked a government bus with undocumented women and children heading to a Border Patrol station.\n\nAnd in Washington, Republicans in the House of Representatives have blocked comprehensive immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship.\n\nStanford political science professor Gary Segura says the national GOP continues to alienate Latino voters.\n\n\u201cWhat happened here 20 years ago in many ways is a prologue for what\u2019s happening nationwide, so it\u2019s a really interesting path,\u201d Segura says. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to find people not learn from their mistakes.\u201d\n\nBut at least two Republican Congress members in the Central Valley have changed course. David Valadao and Jeff Denham both represent districts with large numbers of Latinos. Both have also endorsed a path to citizenship. And Amanda Renteria, a Latina Democrat challenging Valadao, this election is having a hard time energizing Latino voters to cast ballots \u2014 in part because there\u2019s nothing like Prop. 187 driving them to vote.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The measure was a kind of citizens' revolt over illegal immigration in 1994, and passed\u00a0overwhelmingly.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Political Effects Linger 20 Years After Prop. 187 Targeted Illegal Immigration\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/2014\\/11\\/04\\/political-effects-linger-20-years-after-prop-187-targeted-illegal-immigration\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-04 08:00:03\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-11-04 13:04:19\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":10346251,\"author_id\":\"255\",\"author_name\":\"Scott Shafer\",\"author_display_name\":\"Scott Shafer\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Immigration\",\"News\",\"Politics and Government\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/news\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/10\\/2014\\/10\\/RS12884_6057232022_182a7c308b_o-qut.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "KQED News", "description": "The measure was a kind of citizens' revolt over illegal immigration in 1994, and passed\u00a0overwhelmingly.", "title": "Political Effects Linger 20 Years After Prop. 187 Targeted Illegal Immigration", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/news/2014/11/04/political-effects-linger-20-years-after-prop-187-targeted-illegal-immigration/", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/ww2.kqed.org/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2014/10/RS12884_6057232022_182a7c308b_o-qut.jpg?fit=640%2C428", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqednews", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@scottshafer"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "google-site-verification": "Oam-TnlJjUP-cg8UEyR3-KcLp8_-WTy6_dBaSws1ADA", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae5b\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis is right in the middle of what used to be ground zero in terms of illegal immigration,\u201d says Pete Nunez.\nThe federal government won\u2019t stop them at the border, yet requires us to pay billions to take care of them.\u201dPete Wilson\u2019s 1994 Prop.\nIt was a kind of citizens\u2019 revolt in 1994 over illegal immigration, and it passed overwhelmingly with 59 percent of the vote.\nPointing toward the south and east, he notes, \u201cMost of what you see today wasn\u2019t here 20 years ago because it was overrun by illegal immigrants.\nHe mentions a study at the time showing how much money illegal immigration cost California."}
