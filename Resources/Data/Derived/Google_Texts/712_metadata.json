(Joe Skipper/Reuters)\n\nIf Obamacare had met its projected enrollment of 20 million (instead of 10 million) or if it had stemmed rising health-care costs (and kept premiums flat), it would be hard for conservatives to advocate repeal based on abstract arguments about compulsion and centralization. Fortunately for Obamacare critics, they have no problem identifying serious deficiencies:\n\nThis month the Health and Human Services Department dramatically discounted its internal estimate of how many people will join the state insurance exchanges in 2016. There are about 9.1 million enrollees today, and the consensus estimate\u2014by the Congressional Budget Office, the Medicare actuary and independent analysts like Rand Corp.\u2014was that participation would surge to some 20 million. But HHS now expects enrollment to grow to between merely 9.4 million and 11.4 million. . . . Among this population of the uninsured, HHS reports that half are between the ages of 18 and 34 and nearly two-thirds are in excellent or very good health. The exchanges won\u2019t survive actuarially unless they attract this prime demographic: ObamaCare\u2019s individual mandate penalty and social-justice redistribution are supposed to force these low-cost consumers to buy overpriced policies to cross-subsidize everybody else. No wonder HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said meeting even the downgraded target is \u201cprobably pretty challenging.\u201d\n\nRepublicans convince only other Republicans when they decry Obamacare and point out its disappointing results. They win converts when they offer an improved alternative. Given that Obamacare\u2019s flaws are coming into plain view, it is a particularly opportune moment for presidential candidates and Republicans in Congress to provide a thoughtful alternative.\n\nRepublicans are so used to making ideological arguments that they forget utilitarian ones generally work better. \u201cObamacare is a bust, and we have something better\u201d is the most effective message in a general, presidential election since it would appeal to those who don\u2019t think some form of government-subsidized health care is a nonstarter. (For this reason, repeatedly voting to repeal Obamacare with no alternative has virtually no political benefit for Republicans.)\n\nRight now the bar for \u201csomething better\u201d is fairly low: Cover more than 10 million people; do it without forcing people to overpay for insurance they don\u2019t want; and use market competition to reduce premium costs. In other words, instead of \u201crepeal and replace,\u201d the formulation should be: \u201cDo much better than Obamacare.\u201d Voters fear something being taken away; Republicans can offer something better because they are not stuck defending the status quo.\n\nThat obviously means having something better at the ready. The good news is that presidential candidates (e.g. Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio) and several Republican plans in the House and Senate have the same essential features:\n\nThe plans all center on a tax credit intended to help people afford health insurance, along with more limited protection for people with preexisting health conditions and a cap on federal payments to states for the low-income Medicaid program. Bush\u2019s plan \u201cseems to reflect an emerging consensus among Republicans about what the Affordable Care Act (ACA) should be replaced with,\u201d said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, which conducts nonpartisan health analysis. \u201cFor folks who want to move in the direction of the patients, the options are pretty clear, I think,\u201d said Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), who has authored a plan that is similar to Bush\u2019s, Rubio\u2019s and [Wisconsin Gov. Scott]Walker\u2019s.\n\nIn short, take care of the problem of the older, sicker uninsurable people rather than force healthier, younger people to overbuy insurance. Give self-insurers the same benefit via a tax credit that employer-provided health care insurance gives employees.\n\nWith a new speaker like Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) running the show, the House could pass such a plan, even if on a party-line vote. The fine print matters less than the overall structure, since it is not going to survive a Senate filibuster or a presidential veto.\n\nWith a House version of health-care reform and a nominee with a viable alternative to Obamacare, the argument is no longer whether the public wants Obamacare or not; rather, it is whether we should stick with the status quo or get something that works as advertised. That is where Republicans want to be in 2016. Let Hillary Clinton defend an underperforming, more expensive plan that was fraudulently sold (e.g. \u201cyou can keep your doctor\u201d).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans have to do better than Obamacare.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Republicans have to do better than Obamacare.", "title": "It\u2019s the GOP\u2019s moment to offer an Obamacare alternative", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/10/26/its-the-gops-moment-to-offer-an-obamacare-alternative/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/WashingtonPost/Content/Blogs/fact-checker/Images/2013-12-30T195635Z_01_TOR601_RTRIDSP_3_USA-HEALTHCARE-NEW-YEAR.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@JRubinBlogger"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2015/10/26/its-the-gops-moment-to-offer-an-obamacare-alternative/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "obamacare alternative, obamacare enrollment, obamacare underperform", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "obamacare alternative, obamacare enrollment, obamacare underperform"}, "article_summary": "(For this reason, repeatedly voting to repeal Obamacare with no alternative has virtually no political benefit for Republicans.)\nGive self-insurers the same benefit via a tax credit that employer-provided health care insurance gives employees.\nGiven that Obamacare\u2019s flaws are coming into plain view, it is a particularly opportune moment for presidential candidates and Republicans in Congress to provide a thoughtful alternative.\nBut HHS now expects enrollment to grow to between merely 9.4 million and 11.4 million.\nThey win converts when they offer an improved alternative."}
