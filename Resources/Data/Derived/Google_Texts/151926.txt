Vice President Joe Biden has been one of the most strident drug warriors of my lifetime. Mandatory minimum sentences, the crack/powder disparity, federal asset forfeiture, the RAVE Actâ€”they all have Biden's fingerprints on them. The man may be responsible for the very phrase "drug czar." If the Drug War had its own Mount Rushmore, Biden's face would be carved on it, right next to Richard Nixon and Bill Bennett.

Guess why his son got kicked out of the Navy Reserve?

Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter was discharged from the Navy Reserve this year after testing positive for cocaine, according to people familiar with the matter.



Hunter Biden, a lawyer by training who is now a managing partner at an investment company, had been commissioned as an ensign in the Navy Reserve, a part-time position. But after failing a drug test last year, his brief military career ended.

While I'm sure it's no fun to be booted from the Navy, I'm glad the younger Biden hasn't had to suffer any formal penalty greater than that. It's a shame his father's laws have wrecked the lives of so many people who did no more than he did.
