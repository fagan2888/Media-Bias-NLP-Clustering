CMS encourages hospitals to help patients understand their potential financial liability and compare charges for similar services across facilities. Furthermore, CMS expects hospitals to update the information as often as appropriate, but at least annually.\n\nEffective October 1, 2014, the proposed rule affirms that hospitals are responsible for establishing their charges and for determining how to make charges available to the public. A hospital is not required to publish, for example, the chargemaster itself.\n\nThese guidelines follow a series of recent transparency efforts by CMS. In early April of this year, CMS released Medicare physician payment data for the first time since 1979. In 2013, CMS released information on average charges for the 100 most common inpatient services and more than 3,000 hospitals across the country, as well as average charges for 30 outpatient procedures.[2] Intended, in part, to enable comparison, the data has generally revealed significant variation in hospital charges and Medicare payments. However, federal officials and healthcare analysts alike have emphasized that the data should be interpreted with caution: there are various potential explanations for the findings, many of which are reasonable. The same warning will likely hold true for information released under the IPPS rule, especially since negotiated rates between hospitals and insurers remain private, which emphasizes the importance of effective communication strategies.\n\nOnce CMS issues its final rule, there may be an increase at the state level of legislative and regulatory activity with respect to hospital charges and transparency. Currently, many states require the reporting of pricing information, but there is significant variation in features such as scope and proscribed platforms for disclosure.\n\nCMS is accepting comments on the proposed IPPS rule until June 30, 2014. A final rule is to be issued by August 1, 2014.\n\n[1] A CMS factsheet exploring the proposed IPPS rule is available here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CMS released the proposed fiscal year 2015 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) rule for inpatient stays in long-term and general acute care hospitals.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "Recently, CMS released the proposed fiscal year 2015 Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) rule for inpatient stays in long-term and general acute care hospitals.[1]&amp;nbsp;Included among the regu", "title": "The Push for Greater Transparency in Healthcare Continues", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/push-greater-transparency-healthcare-continues", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1123/Ken%20Yood.jpg?itok=9ol2ImRS", "type": "article"}, "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "keywords": "Legal, Business, Center Medicare Services, Inpatient Prospective Payment System, Public Health Service, Affordable Care Act", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, Center Medicare Services, Inpatient Prospective Payment System, Public Health Service Act, Affordable Care Act"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb7b0\"", "article_summary": "[1] Included among the regular updates to Medicare payment policies and rates are guidelines for compliance with the Affordable Care Act\u2019s hospital charges transparency requirement.\n[2] Intended, in part, to enable comparison, the data has generally revealed significant variation in hospital charges and Medicare payments.\nIn early April of this year, CMS released Medicare physician payment data for the first time since 1979.\n[1] A CMS factsheet exploring the proposed IPPS rule is available here.\nCMS is accepting comments on the proposed IPPS rule until June 30, 2014."}
