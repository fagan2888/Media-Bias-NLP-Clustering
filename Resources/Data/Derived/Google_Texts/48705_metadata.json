This passes for a reason to believe in CAGW in some quarters. (Like the White House.)\n\nTo be fair, very few of the people who use the 97% number to look down on skeptics have examined the \"97% consensus\" studies even superficially. Since they are quoting studies they haven't read (and which require no deep science knowledge to read), this is not to their credit, but in many cases the sin is more laziness than malice.\n\nIt's also a lot easier for a believer in CAGW to quote a \"97% consensus\" figure they saw online somewhere than to explain why -- here's that number again! -- 97% of climate models were shown in 2013 to be running hotter than reality.\n\nSeriously.\n\nBut why bring this all up today? Because the Friends of Science Society, a Canadian group based in Calgary, has just released a new report examining the actual data behind the \"97% consensus\" figure (it also mentions the 97% of climate models run hot figure on page 21, if you're interested).\n\nIf you are among those who are tired of having the 97% consensus allegation thrown at you -- or, more important, if you are one of those throwing it -- you can read the study here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://www.conservativeblog.org/resource/GlobalWarmingShirtClimateW.jpg?fileId=24350358", "description": "For a decade now, believers in CAGW, that is, the theory of catastrophic anthroprogenic global war...", "title": "Do 97% of All Climate Scientists Really Believe Mankind is Causing Catastrophic Global\u00a0Warming? - Amy Ridenour's National Center Blog - A Conservative Blog"}, "blogburst-verify": "B9EORVLmLdD0z2JKwETUEmoZ", "Robots": "index,follow"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbccb\"", "article_summary": "For example, did you know that one way these studies can reach the magical consensus number of 97% is by defining human-caused global warming so broadly, even global warming skeptics qualify for the 97% percent?\nTo be fair, very few of the people who use the 97% number to look down on skeptics have examined the \"97% consensus\" studies even superficially.\nFor a decade now, believers in CAGW, that is, the theory of catastrophic anthroprogenic global warming, have repeatedly made the absurd claim that 97% of all climate scientists believe human beings are causing the Earth's temperature to dangerously rise.\n-- 97% of climate models were shown in 2013 to be running hotter than reality.\nThe idea is to use the appeal to authority fallacy to convince the public to believe in CAGW (and costly public policies based upon same) because 97% of all climate scientists supposedly do."}
