A new Medcsape report out Wednesday shows how much different types of physicians report making, and who is still paying off student loans.

Orthopedists, cardiologists and dermatologists are the top-earners among physicians, according to the report. Physicians practicing family medicine, endocrinology and pediatrics earned the least, the report says. While the average pediatrician earned $204,000 in 2015, the average orthopedists earned $443,000 over the year.

The report says physicians who pay off student loans over the long term with interest can end up paying over $400,000. Physicians practicing emergency and family medicine were the highest groups reporting that they were still paying off loans, with 33 percent of respondents in each group saying they were still in debt after their education. Sixteen percent of physicians practicing rheumatology and gastroenterology each said they were still paying off debt, the groups with the lowest percentage.

“It is not known why some specialists are more able to pay medical school debts,” the report says. “Although family physicians are toward the bottom in earnings, there is no obvious relationship between school debt and earnings among other physician groups.”

Medscape surveyed 19,183 physicians across 26 specialities for the survey.
