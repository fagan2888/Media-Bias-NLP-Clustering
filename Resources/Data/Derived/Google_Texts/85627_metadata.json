This is out of a roughly $300 million budget for the Legislature. The newspaper found most of the travel was within Pennsylvania, but Denver, Minneapolis and Boston were destinations as well. The records include travel spending by freshmen lawmakers who took office on Dec. 1.\n\nRelated:\n\nTheir spending includes vehicle mileage costs, receipts for actual expenses and per diem expenses for lodging for which no receipts are needed. Some lawmaker\u2019s accounts cover staff travel as well.\n\nLawmakers collected 56 cents a mile following IRS rates. The per diem in Harrisburg \u2014 daily allowances to cover a lawmaker\u2019s expenses while away from home on public business \u2014 for much of 2014 was $157. The federal government sets per diem rates for different cities. Per diems can be collected at separate lodging and meal rates.\n\nUnder the state Constitution, lawmakers can receive salary and mileage for regular and special sessions. Some lawmakers have the notation \u201cconstitutional mileage\u201d in their reports.\n\nHowever, many lawmakers fail to include any explanation for their expenses, the newspaper found.\n\nLawmakers have legitimate travel expenses, but they need to provide better documentation for them, said Barry Kauffman, executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cYou (should) have to submit receipts that you actually have this expense,\u201d said Mr. Kauffman, adding that the Legislature needs stricter policies requiring lawmakers to submit receipts.\n\nThe House adopted policies in recent years that require members to sign documents giving the time/date/place and purpose to get a per diem for an overnight stay and ended member reimbursements for meal and lodging expenses on holidays or for attending committee meetings at which they do not have specific business.\n\nLawmakers\u2019 travel varies\n\nRep. Sid Michaels Kavulich, D-114, Taylor, said he does not seek reimbursement for all his travel and submits receipts when he does. His spending totaled $5,165.\n\nWhile he gets reimbursed for mileage to and from Harrisburg, Mr. Kavulich said he does not for travel in the district. He also said he is selective about which committee hearings he attends.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t go to all the committee meetings,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of them are so far away and take up too much time.\u201d\n\nRep. Jerry Knowles, R-124, Tamaqua, said he bills for travel that has a clear legislative purpose. His overall spending was $6,080 last year and his records include notations for travel to present citations and attend ground-breaking ceremonies in his district.\n\nProviding notations on expense records provides accountability, said Mr. Kauffman.\n\n\u201cThis is another tool that constituents have to see what their public officials are really doing,\u201d he said.\n\nTwo lawmakers representing Northeast Pennsylvania rank among the top travel spenders in their respective chambers, the newspaper found.\n\nRep. Sandra Major, R-111, Bridgewater Twp., spent $16,229 for travel-related expenses last year, ranking third among the 203 House lawmakers. Much of that spending was for attending functions in the district, said Ms. Major, also the House majority caucus chairwoman.\n\nThe rural 111th District is the eighth-largest geographically among the 203 House districts, said Ms. Major.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not one to send staff,\u201d she said. \u201cI go myself.\u201d\n\nSen. David Argall, R-29, Tamaqua, ranked No. 2 among the 50 senators with more than $25,000 in travel-related expenses.\n\nHowever, a breakdown provided by Mr. Argall\u2019s staff shows that staff mileage accounts for $9,500 of this amount. Mr. Argall has since put his staff expenses on the Senate chief clerk\u2019s account.\n\nRep. Patrick Harkins, D-1, Erie, and Sen. Scott Hutchinson, R-21, Oil City, were the top travel spenders in their chambers at $29,619 and $27,388 respectively. Both have long commutes to Harrisburg.\n\nConferences\n\nMuch legislator travel was to attend conferences, the newspaper found.\n\nFor example, Rep. Tina Pickett, R-110, Towanda, spent more than $500 last July attending the National Conference of Insurance Legislators in Boston. Her overall travel spending was $10,759.\n\nMs. Pickett heads the House Insurance Committee, which handles bills involving insurance lines, agents and brokers and the state Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. The Boston conference covered topics concerning the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid and flood insurance.\n\nMs. Pickett became committee chairwoman in mid-session in 2013. She said the Boston conference helped her become knowledgeable about this specialized field.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Frank Dermody, D-33, Allegheny County, and several other lawmakers attended the annual National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) annual conference last summer in Minneapolis. Mr. Dermody spent $620 on round-trip airfare to the event and his overall travel spending in 2014 was $11,029.\n\n\u201cNot all legislators attend NCSL meetings, but those who do derive great benefits by exchanging ideas and lessons with lawmakers from around the country,\u201d said Dermody spokesman Bill Patton. \u201cEvery meeting features dozens of seminars with national policy experts. It\u2019s an intense, focused learning opportunity to find more effective policies to try in Pennsylvania.\u201d\n\nMr. Dermody reviews requests from his caucus members to attend NCSL events to determine if they will benefit from it, said Mr. Patton.\n\nLegislative advocacy\n\nMany legislators also traveled to research legislation and took field trips related to their committees, the newspaper found.\n\nSen. Daylin Leach, D-17, King of Prussia, sponsor of a medical marijuana bill, made a well-publicized trip to Colorado where cannabis is legal. He spent $753 on lodging for three nights, $590 on airfare and $562 on car rental during that trip. His overall travel spending last year totaled $10,504.\n\n\u201cWe packed as much information-gathering as we could into our three days,\u201d Mr. Leach wrote in an op-ed piece published on his website. \u201cWe toured two facilities where the marijuana is grown, one lab where it is processed, one where it is tested for potency and impurities and two dispensaries, which are essentially marijuana stores.\u201d\n\nCommittees\n\nRep. Frank Farina, D-112, Jessup, sat on two committees last year \u2014 Tourism and Recreational Development and Game and Fisheries \u2014 that went on field trips. His overall spending was $9,088.\n\nHe spent $274 on an overnight trip in January 2014 with a tourism panel visiting attractions in Doylestown, including the James A. Michener Art Museum and Mercer Museum.\n\nAnother committee member, Rep. Karen Boback, R-117, Harveys Lake, spent $123 on the Doylestown trip. Her overall spending was $3,073.\n\nMr. Farina spent $377 on mileage and lodging last September while attending an educational lecture and field trip on the Pennsylvania elk herd sponsored by the game committee.\n\nRep. Marty Flynn, D-113, Scranton, spent $364 attending a House Aging & Older Adult Services Committee meeting in Pittsburgh last summer regarding a state plan to address Alzheimer\u2019s care.\n\nMr. Flynn said the hearing provided information about how local Alzheimer\u2019s centers have coped with state funding cuts. His overall spending was $10,727.\n\nRep. Mike Carroll, D-118, Avoca, spent nearly $300 attending House Transportation Committee meetings last spring at Shawnee-on-Delaware and York respectively on police radar use and school bus safety. His overall spending was $8,089.\n\nA Capitol activist who tracks legislative spending thinks much of the travel is unnecessary.\n\n\u201cPublic officials can defray travel costs by embracing technology and telecommute, teleconference and Skype,\u201d said Eric Epstein, co-founder of RockTheCapital.\n\nContact the writer: rswift@timesshamrock.com", "article_metadata": {"author": "BY ROBERT SWIFT, HARRISBURG BUREAU CHIEF", "title": "Lawmakers spent $1.8 M on travel last year", "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "DC.creator": "BY ROBERT SWIFT, HARRISBURG BUREAU CHIEF", "tout": {"article": {"id": "1.1874908"}}, "keywords": "Local", "DC.subject": "Local", "bitly-verification": "68008dbe9586", "DC.title": "Lawmakers spent $1.8 M on travel last year"}, "article_summary": "Lawmakers\u2019 travel variesRep.
