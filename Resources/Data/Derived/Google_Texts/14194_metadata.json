His million-dollar arm got him a contract with the St. Louis Cardinals and eventually got him into the Hall of Fame. But when he turned pro, pitching for St. Joseph in the Western League, ol\u2019 Dizzy acted like a kid. Because he was a kid.\n\nHe got into fistfights with roommates. He ran up debt all over town at shirt shops. And he married a woman one day after meeting her. He settled down only when the Cardinals signed his brother, Paul, to look after him.\n\nWhen the Rockies selected high school players with their first five picks in Major League Baseball\u2019s amateur draft last week, they were betting on future stars. They\u2019re about to throw millions of dollars at kids they hope have Dizzy\u2019s arm or Troy Tulowitzki\u2019s bat.\n\nThe best teenage baseball prospects in the country are more polished and accomplished than ever. But they are still kids. And growing up isn\u2019t any easier than it was for Dizzy Dean in 1930.\n\nBrendan Rodgers, a high school shortstop from Florida who was drafted with the No. 3 pick, and Mike Nikorak, a right-handed prep pitcher from Pennsylvania taken at No. 27, soon will sign multimillion-dollar contracts with the Rockies. They\u2019re riding high now, wining and dining with advisers, scouts and general managers.\n\nBut then real life will kick in. And they will realize they\u2019re just kids living alone. How they respond off the field \u2014 how these kids turn into adults \u2014 will determine, perhaps more than their baseball talent, how far they go with the Rockies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough sled for a kid that age,\u201d said Colorado manager Walt Weiss. \u201cIt\u2019s a very dog-eat-dog business we\u2019re in. This is a tough racket. And there are some tough lessons to be learned.\u201d\n\nThe odds are stacked in front of them like the Green Monster at Fenway Park. About 300 high school players were picked in the draft this year, among 1,215 total selections. But only 234 players made their big-league debuts last year \u2014 and only 46 of those were drafted out of high school.\n\nIn other words, a high school player who is drafted by a big-league team has about a 3-in-100 chance of making it to The Show.\n\nOf the players on the Rockies\u2019 40-man big-league roster, only seven were drafted out of high school \u2014 Justin Morneau, Kyle Kendrick, LaTroy Hawkins, Nolan Arenado, Jordan Lyles, Tyler Chatwood and Tyler Matzek. Only Matzek was drafted in the first round by the Rockies, with their top pick (No. 11) in 2009.\n\nRodgers and Nikorak \u2014 along with third baseman Tyler Nevin and right-hander Peter Lambert of California and right-hander Javier Medina of Arizona \u2014 will likely report to the Grand Junction Rockies soon. They\u2019re each 18 years old. And in the rookie-level Pioneer League, with a cheap per diem, long days of work and outsized expectations, they will travel by bus to Utah, Idaho and Montana.\n\n\u201cYour life changes dramatically, 100 percent,\u201d said Colorado pitcher Rafael Betancourt. \u201cBut that\u2019s how you learn to be a man.\u201d\n\nWalking the road alone\n\nRodgers, a power-hitting shortstop with a power arm, already looks the part of a pro. His goatee and mullet make him look like he\u2019s 18 going on 30. He hits a ton. And he aced the showcase circuit for teenage prospects. He might have been the best high school prospect in the country even when he was a sophomore.\n\nOn a Florida select team, Rodgers worked with Miami Marlins second baseman Dee Gordon and Tampa Bay Rays shortstop Nick Franklin. In Little League, his hitting coach was Dante Bichette.\n\nThe night Rodgers was drafted \u2014 as the third pick he was the third shortstop taken, after two college players \u2014 the Rockies\u2019 newest hope said he was looking forward to learning from Tulowitzki.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of the best power-hitting shortstops to ever play the game,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cHe\u2019s someone I look up to. And hopefully in a few weeks, I can get some tips from him.\u201d\n\nBut Tulowitzki \u2014 if he was joking, you can decide \u2014 wasn\u2019t having any of that.\n\n\u201cI know he mentioned my name. I think he said I was going to give him some tips, but I will probably give him no tips,\u201d Tulowitzki said. \u201cI will probably give him the cold shoulder, keep that edge and make it tough for him.\u201d\n\nRodgers will have to walk the road alone. And it will be tough enough without cold shoulders. There\u2019s a line of Rockies prospects in front of him, including Trevor Story, Cristhian Adames and Rosell Herrera.\n\nIntensity on the rise\n\nYoung prospects play more baseball than ever. As teenagers, they travel year-round to showcase tournaments that play more like NFL scouting combines. It\u2019s not just Little League; these players get churned through a baseball factory.\n\nNikorak throws a 97 mph fastball. Before his senior year, he started working with advisers and nutritionists who regularly work with professional athletes. He gained nearly 25 pounds to impress pro scouts.\n\nAnd when he became bored throwing fastballs to high school hitters, he worked with a personal team to add pitches.\n\n\u201cI was pretty much dominating with my fastball in high school and I knew I could get away with it,\u201d Nikorak said. \u201cBut leading up to the draft, and for the (higher) levels, I knew I would need to develop off-speed pitches.\u201d\n\nWeiss said the focus on prepping to become a pro has been a give-and-take process for young prospects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more intense, a lot more serious at a much earlier age now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot of opportunity created by it. But I don\u2019t know if kids get to enjoy the game and experience the pure joy of the game as kids, like we did.\u201d\n\n\u201cLearn as you go\u201d\n\nPete Kozma, an infielder with the Cardinals who was drafted in the first round in 2007 out of Oklahoma, looks back at his teenage days as a pro ballplayer without regret. But there were times when he wondered whether it was the right choice, he said.\n\n\u201cThe hardest part was learning how to live by yourself \u2014 like, really live by yourself,\u201d said Kozma, now 27.\n\n\u201cIn college, you have roommates and you\u2019re at your own pace, with people to help you along. But up here, guys are polished, they\u2019ve been through it, there are guys from different countries. So you\u2019re doing it all by yourself.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just a kid and you have to learn as you go.\u201d\n\nIf Rodgers and Nikorak \u2014 or any of the 15 high school kids drafted by the Rockies last week \u2014 ever wear a big-league uniform, it will happen only after they grow up. Baseball is the same at every level. But kids can\u2019t survive playing in front of a third deck at Coors Field.\n\n\u201cWe drafted some very talented young kids who we feel have a bright future,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cBut there will be some growing pains along the way.\u201d\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke\n\nThis article originally omitted Nolan Arenado from the list of Rockies high school draft picks currently on the roster.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Tough road ahead for teenage Rockies Brendan Rodgers, Mike Nikorak", "title": "Tough road ahead for teenage Rockies Brendan Rodgers, Mike Nikorak", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/13/tough-road-ahead-for-teenage-rockies-brendan-rodgers-mike-nikorak/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150613__20150614_C1_Sp14BBNROXENTERp2.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150613__20150614_C1_Sp14BBNROXENTERp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-13T20:14:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T12:52:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca02d\"", "article_summary": "About 300 high school players were picked in the draft this year, among 1,215 total selections.\n\u201cI was pretty much dominating with my fastball in high school and I knew I could get away with it,\u201d Nikorak said.\nAnd when he became bored throwing fastballs to high school hitters, he worked with a personal team to add pitches.\nBrendan Rodgers, a high school shortstop from Florida who was drafted with the No.\nHe might have been the best high school prospect in the country even when he was a sophomore."}
