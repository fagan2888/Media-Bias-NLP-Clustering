But when a reporter asked the California congresswoman whether this represented \u201cvindication\u201d and a \u201cturning of the tide\u201d on the unpopular law, she stopped short of declaring Obamacare a winning issue.\n\n\u201cWell let me just say, those of us who fought for this knew what we believed in and really don\u2019t think we needed any vindication,\u201d she responded. \u201cWe just had to protect it from those ideological anti-government people who didn\u2019t want to see it succeed \u2014 for ideological, or political or whatever those reasons are.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaking the heat on something like that \u2014 well, that\u2019s what we do,\u201d she bragged. \u201cThat\u2019s like, all in a day\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nAnd regarding Obamacare\u2019s power to help Democrats in 2014?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d she shrugged. \u201cI think the fight for the election \u2014 elections are always about jobs. So I think that while we\u2019re proud of the Affordable Care Act, we now pivot to job creation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich is \u2014 you know, the bill creates \u2014 will create 4 million jobs,\u201d she added. \u201cThis is a jobs bill \u2014 we never advertise that \u2014 it\u2019s a deficit reducer, it\u2019s a job creator. And again, it is affordable, quality care. So maybe it just clears the air a bit so we can have a fuller discussion of jobs. And that\u2019s a place where Republicans have been totally bankrupt in terms of their suggestion.\u201d\n\nBreitbart reports that the White House and Democrats attempted their last \u201cpivot\u201d to jobs in November. Pelosi\u2019s announcement marks the 22nd time a national Democratic leader has tried to reset their party\u2019s focus on unemployment and other economic issues.\n\nFollow Brendan on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
