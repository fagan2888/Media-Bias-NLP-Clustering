We do not want to get up to 1,000 again, that was really uncomfortable and really stressful on the animals.\"\n\n\n\nIn the last two month, the Pima Animal Care Center has responded to several hoarding situations.\n\nThe hoarding complaints tend to go up in the summer because people complain about smell of their animals and want someone to come pick them up.\n\n\n\nFifty animals picked up were picked up from one home, Hollish said.\n\n\n\nThere are almost 1,000 animals in the shelter total and due to the shortage of space, officials have had to put three animals in a single kennel.\n\nPutting the animals in the same kennel can cause anxiety and can increase their chances of getting sick.\n\n\n\nThis weekend, PACC is waiving adoption fees for all animals. All animals come with all their shots, sprayed and neutered.\n\nThe waived fees will apply to all adoptions at the main shelter at 4000 N. Silverbell Road and at the following off-site adoption locations:\n\n\u2022 PetSmart at Oracle and Wetmore (cats, dogs, puppies and kittens)\n\n\u2022 PetSmart at Grant and Swan (cats, dogs, puppies and kittens)\n\n\u2022 PetSmart at El Con Mall \u2013 between Home Depot and Target (cats, dogs, puppies and kittens)\n\n\u2022 La Encantada at Skyline Drive/Campbell Road (dogs and puppies)\n\nThe shelter is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nPetSmart locations will offer free kitten and cat adoptions through Sunday, with puppies and dogs from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday.\n\nFor more information go to www.pima.gov/animalcare.\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
