Little Health and Human Services Center. \"And they would be remiss in not having that.\"\n\nBut in light of a directive from the Gov. Rick Scott administration that county officials not seek federal grants to operate such facilities \u2013 which would mean the loss of $1.9 million under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 county commissioners are crying crisis\n\nHealth honchos are a bit more cautious.\n\n\"Well, it is a crisis if it went away and just left 30,000 individuals without care,\" said Chuck Henry, the Florida Health/Sarasota administrator. \"The department is working very diligently to seek out partners to look at various options because our primary goal as the Department of Health is to connect individuals to needed services.\"\n\nIf the county centers closed, places like the clinics of the Manatee County Rural Health Services, also accredited as a \u201cfederally qualified health center,\u201d would ideally pick up the slack, but they're not sure they can handle the extra business.\n\n\"The only thing that I believe is known is that if there is not an adequate plan there are going to be a lot of residents of Sarasota County that won't have their primary and preventative health care needs met, \" said Dr. William Colgate, the senior vice president of accreditation and quality for Manatee County Rural Health Services.\n\nThe current funding runs out in about a year.\n\nThe deadline to extend the funding or find a sensible surrogate is in the fall, but for now, patients shouldn't notice a big difference\n\n\"We're open, we're taking new appointments,\" said Henry, the administrator at Florida Health/Sarasota. \"We're taking new clients and that will continue into the future.\"\n\nBottom line is that there is no crisis, yet. It's hoped that this early intervention and call to action now may just prevent that down the line.", "article_metadata": {"isStory": "true", "isPremium": "false", "description": "The loss of Primary Care capabilities at the County Health Department is a looming health care crisis.\u00a0 What's being done to remedy that remains to be seen.", "author": "Bill Logan", "og": {"site_name": "WFTS", "description": "The loss of Primary Care capabilities at the County Health Department is a looming health care crisis.\u00a0 What's being done to remedy that remains to be seen.", "title": "Sarasota County Health Department looks at its Primary Care role", "url": "http://www.abcactionnews.com/news/region-sarasota-manatee/sarasota-county-health-department-looks-at-its-primary-care-role", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media2.abcactionnews.com/photo/2015/03/04/Primary_care_in_jeopardy_in_Sarasota_Cou_2668670000_14383985_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 481462961, "iphone": 487366506}}, "site": "@abcactionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "shortHeadline": "Directive puts primary care in question for some", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages03.net,scripps.mkt7057.com,www.abcactionnews.com,recp.mkt32.net", "hasVideo": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 168779733303299}, "idio": {"hasVideo": "true", "isPremium": "false", "author": "Bill Logan"}, "keywords": "local,news,highlands,manatee,sarasota,Region Sarasota Manatee,News,Story Hold,Homepage Showcase,Tablet Showcase,Mobile Showcase,Newsletter Showcase,Local News", "google-site-verification": "ZPY4dKk8Ho1Ab_iOhbUbmJcIGUZ71n2qre3MD7_WN6M", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/tampabaynews", "published_time": "2015-03-05T01:34:42+0000", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/", "section": "Region Sarasota Manatee", "modified_time": "2015-03-05T01:34:42+0000", "tag": "news, local, highlands, manatee, sarasota"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, target-densitydpi=device-dpi, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca1e2\"", "article_summary": "For the past 35 years, folks have flocked to county health department locations like the one on Ringling Boulevard in Sarasota.\nBut a new state directive may mean that thousands of Sarasota County citizens won't have anywhere to turn for their primary health care as the County Health Department discusses getting out of the doctoring business.\nIf the county centers closed, places like the clinics of the Manatee County Rural Health Services, also accredited as a \u201cfederally qualified health center,\u201d would ideally pick up the slack, but they're not sure they can handle the extra business.\n\"The department is working very diligently to seek out partners to look at various options because our primary goal as the Department of Health is to connect individuals to needed services.\"\nThey seek check-ups, baby care and the kind of stuff that keeps you from becoming unhealthy."}
