The company has advised all wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, and healthcare providers to send the drug back to their facilities after mold was discovered during a routine testing process, Reuters reported.\n\n\"We estimate that fewer than 5,000 dose packs remain in the market considering our current inventory levels and the usage of this product,\" company representative Robyn Reed Frenze told Reuters. \"There have been no trends of adverse events of infection associated with this lot.\"\n\nJust last week, Johnson & Johnson issued a voluntary recall for 200,000 bottles of its popular infant formula Motrin Infants Drops Original Berry Flavor. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, tiny plastic particles were discovered in the product lot before it was released to the market.\n\n\"From our perspective, during the manufacturing process at the third party supplier, that's when the particles got into the ibuprofen,\" said McNeil Vice President Ed Kuffner to the Associated Press.
