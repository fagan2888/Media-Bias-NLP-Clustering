A collective of gourmet chefs have crafted their latest confection, available for free at an undisclosed popup shop in London, from a combination of veal, chicken liver, pork and bone marrow based on the declarations of famous cannibals. They've timed the special with the fifth season launch of The Walking Dead.\n\nJames Thomlinson told Horror Talk website that he typically draws his inspiration from \"flavor combinations and fresh produce,\" and that it was \"a little odd to be inspired by the words of cannibals instead.\"\n\nTheir \"consultants\" were not starving soccer players or Asmat headhunters. They were real psychopaths, including a Wild West-era man named Alfred Packer, who reportedly told a journalist in 1883 that the pectoral muscles of men are \"the sweatest meat.\" Among their other sources of inspiration: \"It melted in my mouth like raw tuna in a sushi restaurant\" (Issei Sagawa), \"It was like good, fully developed veal\" (William Seabrook) and \"I only eat the parts with muscles, particularly the thighs and calves, which are my favorite\" (Dorangel Vargas).", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "human, flesh, burger, anyone, walking, dead, themed, sandwich, inspired, actual, cannibals", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A hamburger made out of real human flesh would be criminal.
