But when asked: \"what is the biggest motivator to use these technology tools?\", \"knowledge of my numbers\" was the number one answer (42%). Only 10% of consumers say incentives are their biggest motivator to use digital health.\n\nBiggest Motivator To Use Digital Health Tools Percent Knowledge--I know my numbers 42% Improving my health--It helps me manage my condition/reach my health goals 26% Accountability--I know someone is tracking the results 19% Incentive--I know I can earn a reward for using it 10% Nothing\u2014I am not really motivated to use it 3%\n\nHowever, when asked if incentives motivated users to use their digital health tools more frequently, 91% said yes.\n\nBryce Williams, CEO and President of HealthMine said, \"Digital health tools have exploded in growth\u2014but more so in the lifestyle management category than in clinical/disease management.\" He continued, \"Every member may not benefit from an activity tracker. For these tools to be effective, they must be tailored to individual needs and connect to the individual's bigger picture of health data.\"\n\nAbout the Survey\n\nThe HealthMine Survey queried 500 consumers who use mobile and/or Internet-connected health applications/devices and are enrolled in a 2016 health plan.
