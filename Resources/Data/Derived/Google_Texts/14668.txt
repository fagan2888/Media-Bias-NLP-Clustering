Family and friends gathered at the scene of a house fire on Knight Island in Charlotte County that took the lives of two people early Sunday morning.



Emergency crews responded at around 2:40 a.m., and when they arrived they found the home fully engulfed in flames.



"There was a boom, and then you just heard all kinds of noises like...almost a war, it was horrible," said Deborah Cooper, who lives on the island.



Neighbors tell us the three-story home, located on N Gulf Boulevard, was gone in minutes.



"I actually thought that it was the front of the yard and then when looked, the house was totally engulfed and it was gone within minutes," added Cooper.



Investigators tell us they found the body of a woman and a man in the charred rubble, but their identities have not been released.



According to the Charlotte County Fire and EMS, four people reside in the home; however, the husband was away out of the area at the time and a daughter was staying at a friend's house.



Neighbors tell us the fire victims were a mother and son.



The next day, family and friends stopped by the home to pay their respects to the victims. Family members collected whatever valuables they could find in the debris.



Neighbors and friends laid flowers at a memorial for the pair.



The cause of the fire is still under investigation.
