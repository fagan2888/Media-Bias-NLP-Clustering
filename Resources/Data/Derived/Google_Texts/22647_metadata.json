California districts are getting at least a two-year reprieve from the ubiquitous Academic Performance Index scores used to track the quality of schools and districts over time.\n\nInstead, educators are preparing for the next big thing: The new Smarter Balanced English-language arts and mathematics tests aligned to the new Common Core standards that school districts have already begun using in classrooms. The new tests emphasize a deeper knowledge of subjects, displaying use of the reasoning process and the ability to give complex answers, and not just skill at choosing the correct answer out of four possible choices.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re more critical-thinking skills, and we\u2019ve been talking about that for a long time, but if you\u2019re only asking A, B, C or D, you don\u2019t get the chance to elaborate,\u201d said Wendy Claflin, principal of Colin Powell Elementary School in Long Beach. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of more true to life, because there\u2019s not just one true answer.\u201d\n\nThe nationwide field test started at the end of March and ends on June 6.\n\nThey need the ramp-up time: Unlike the familiar California Standards Tests, the new Smarter Balanced tests aren\u2019t conducted by filling in little circles with a No. 2 pencil. Instead, they\u2019re adaptive tests taken via computer, administered via the Internet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019re going to be glitches with anything new, especially involving technology, but that\u2019s why we\u2019re having this no-stakes (testing) year,\u201d said Christopher Clarke, principal of Arminta Street Elementary in North Hollywood.\n\nTesting the test\n\nStudents taking the California Standards Tests are engaged in a nationwide \u201ctest of the test,\u201d applying the testing software in an attempt to head off the same sort of technological crises that plagued the Affordable Care Act rollout over the last year.\n\n\u201cWe want to imagine every possible disaster that could happen and plan for it,\u201d said Carlye Olsen, director of accountability, staff development and educational technology for the Whittier Union High School District. \u201cWhy do you do fire drills? It\u2019s not just to know where to go; it\u2019s to make sure the bell works and the path is clear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new structure of the tests also requires school districts just starting to recover from years of economic hardship to invest in new technology, from network infrastructure to computers and tablets to peripherals.\n\nThe sudden demand for headphones to take the audio portions of some tests has led to a backlog at the distribution level, according to Pasadena Unified spokesman Adam Wolfson.\n\n\u201cWe have 35 iPads. One of them doesn\u2019t work,\u201d said Clarke, the Arminta school principal. \u201cI sat through the last 45 minutes of testing, and a lot of students had problems, and the iPads were falling offline. ... But as we get iPads in their hands and they get more comfortable with the technology, things will improve in future years.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles Unified officials have assured Clarke that the school\u2019s Internet connection will be better next year, when students are slated to take the actual test. \u201cThey\u2019re taking it very seriously,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWe\u2019re being assured by next school year that we\u2019ll have much faster connectivity.\u201d\n\nNo test scores are being generated by students this year; rather, it\u2019s a test to see how both the local and national network infrastructure can handle the load of students taking tests and whether the tests themselves work properly.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t know what actually happens when everyone goes online all at once,\u201d said Pasadena Unified Superintendent Jon R. Gundry. He and his staff were at Pasadena High School, where more than 100 educators crowded into a cafeteria, hunched over Chromebooks, learning how to log on to the Smarter Balanced site and administer the new tests.\n\n\u201cThings like YouTube that use a lot of bandwidth, we\u2019re going to slow down on (teachers using) that during testing,\u201d said Tim Stowe, chief academic officer for Torrance Unified. \u201cWe\u2019re also working to double our bandwidth, and that should help, too.\u201d\n\nSome worry that students with exposure to computers at home will have an advantage over their peers.\n\n\u201cSome of what they\u2019re going to be testing through the next few years is how well the kids use technology,\u201d said Gundry of Pasadena Unified. In his district, there are only enough Chromebooks \u2014 a low-cost, low-end Google laptop dependent on Internet connectivity \u2014 for every four students to use one. \u201cAnd that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nDistricts across Southern California are trying to minimize the impact of the technology gap.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at typing and manipulation of the touchpad on the Chromebook so that doesn\u2019t become an issue for whether a student scores well or not,\u201d Torrance\u2019s Stowe said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a district that\u2019s not concerned about that, I want to visit them.\u201d\n\nBut the investment should end up paying dividends year-round:\n\n\u201cOur kids had zero access to technology at school, but now, with the Common Core, and the testing on the computer, I\u2019ve got three computer labs at my school,\u201d said Long Beach\u2019s Claflin. \u201cThis is bringing them to a whole other level of equity.\u201d\n\nQuestioning the questions\n\nBut beyond the technology issues are the test questions themselves: Educators have long mocked the multiple-choice thinking encouraged \u2014 some say demanded \u2014 by 13 years of the federal No Child Left Behind Act and its stiff penalties for districts that don\u2019t show continuing improvement on academic benchmarks. Even districts with high API scores have found themselves failing to continue to improve enough and thus eager to eke out every test score improvement they can.\n\nEducators like to share \u201cI Choose C,\u201d a video that allegedly portrays the impact of more than a dozen years of students being taught test-taking strategies alongside (or instead of) an actual deep understanding of a subject. In it, a graduate in a job interview, when asked tough questions, repeatedly announces that she chooses answer \u201cC,\u201d because her teacher told her that, when in doubt, just guess that on tests.\n\nThe Common Core standards emphasize deeper understanding of fewer topics in a class and the ability to show how students arrived at answers. The Smarter Balanced tests even limit the ability of students to cheat off their peers. Questions are shuffled and students will not all see the exact same sets of questions on all tests.\n\nSome are skeptical about the questions on the new test:\n\n\u201cI look at some of the samples and think \u2018Really? Some of the adults can\u2019t answer this,\u2019\u201d said Pasadena\u2019s Gundry. \u201cEvery time we show parents the sample questions, there\u2019s a roar in the room, because parents can\u2019t answer.\u201d\n\nThat will change, according to Claflin.\n\n\u201cWhen we first had the (Standardized Testing and Reporting) test ... they were looking at some district assessments that were trying to mirror the test, and (a former Long Beach Unified superintendent) was saying \u2018I bet most of us couldn\u2019t do this test,\u2019 \u201d she said.\n\nSome parents are nervous about what the changes mean for their children\u2019s college futures:\n\n\u201cMy office takes at least a dozen phone calls a day\u201d from parents, said Dan Sosa, Chino Valley Unified\u2019s director of assessment and instructional technology. But they needn\u2019t worry: \u201cColleges and businesses were on the forefront in 2010 saying we need better standards for our kids,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re hearing from (the business community) is very supportive of what we\u2019re trying to do,\u201d Stowe said.\n\nThis year\u2019s field test may not be the end of pilot testing, in the opinion of some educators.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re going to benchmark again next year\u201d and do another field test, said Tendaji Jamal, director of information technology for Pasadena Unified.\n\n\u201cChange is always scary, but it can also be very exhilarating,\u201d Claflin said. \u201cThat outweighs the panic.\u201d\n\nThe approach has been embraced by many parents:\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be great for the kids because it\u2019s going to teach them how to use reasoning,\u201d said Denise Jury, president of the Redlands Council of PTAs. In recent years, \u201cthey\u2019ve just been taught how to give the right answer, not how to get to the right answer.\u201d\n\nBut the shift is requiring a major adjustment for others:\n\n\u201cJust because my kid can\u2019t explain his thinking, but he\u2019s getting the math right, why isn\u2019t he getting the highest mark on his report card?\u201d Torrance Unified\u2019s Stowe said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big shift for parents.\u201d\n\nThe new approach is working for students, even measured by the older tests, Claflin said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not really emphasizing teaching to the benchmark any more, but (a second-grade teacher) said a higher percentage of her kids are above grade level ... because we have a more rigorous program now,\u201d Claflin said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 30 sixth-graders sat at computers at Country Springs Elementary School in Chino Hills, but they weren\u2019t facing the monitors.Instead, they were watching a screen at the front of the room, where a video told them something rarely", "title": "Whittier schools prepare for Common Core\u2019s new testing, education approach", "og": {"url": "http://www.whittierdailynews.com/social-affairs/20140412/whittier-schools-prepare-for-common-cores-new-testing-education-approach", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.whittierdailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LE/20140412/NEWS/140419647/AR/0/AR-140419647.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "961px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Whittier schools prepare for Common Core\u2019s new testing, education approach"}, "twitter": {"domain": "whittierdailynews.com", "description": "More than 30 sixth-graders sat at computers at Country Springs Elementary School in Chino Hills, but they weren\u2019t facing the monitors.Instead, they were watching a screen at the front of the room, where a video told them something rarely", "title": "Whittier schools prepare for Common Core\u2019s new testing, education approach", "url": "http://www.whittierdailynews.com/social-affairs/20140412/whittier-schools-prepare-for-common-cores-new-testing-education-approach", "image": {"src": "http://www.whittierdailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LE/20140412/NEWS/140419647/AR/0/AR-140419647.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@WhittierNews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id563971431", "iphone": "id503668140", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.whittierdailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "common core,common core state standards, School curricula", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "common core,common core state standards, School curricula"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd95e4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThat\u2019s a big shift for parents.\u201dThe new approach is working for students, even measured by the older tests, Claflin said.\n\u201cI sat through the last 45 minutes of testing, and a lot of students had problems, and the iPads were falling offline.\nInstead, educators are preparing for the next big thing: The new Smarter Balanced English-language arts and mathematics tests aligned to the new Common Core standards that school districts have already begun using in classrooms.\nQuestions are shuffled and students will not all see the exact same sets of questions on all tests.\nThis year\u2019s field test may not be the end of pilot testing, in the opinion of some educators."}
