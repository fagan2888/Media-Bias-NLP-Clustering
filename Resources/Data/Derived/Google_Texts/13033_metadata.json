Lindsey Graham brought along a longtime friend and fellow foreign policy hawk to double up on deriding President Obama\u2019s policies.\n\nGraham, a Republican nominee for president, was joined by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.\n\nMcCain was the Republican Party\u2019s presidential nominee in 2008, and he won the New Hampshire primary during both of his presidential campaigns in 2000 and 2008.\n\n\u201cI believe that this election will have more to do with the security of this nation than any election since 1980,\u201d McCain said.
