S. winter has been a tale of two nations\u201d in which NOAA said January 2015 was the second warmest January in history behind 2007.\n\nFurther citations of NOAA and NASA-GISS temperatures by Science Writer Borenstein include: \u201cWarming Earth heading for hottest year on record,\u201d \u201cNOAA: Globe sets 5th hottest-month record of 2014,\u201d and \u201cGlobal warming makes for hottest June ever.\u201d In response to Seth Borenstein\u2019s December 2, 2014 article \u201cHotter, weirder: How climate change has changed Earth,\u201d Paul Homewood wrote the article \u201cEducating Seth Borenstein\u201d which refutes claims of wilder weather, hotter temperatures, rising oceans, and reduced sea ice.\n\nThe land surface temperature data used by NOAA and NASA is subject to errors in measurements at temperature stations that were rural 100 years ago and are now in urban areas due to population growth. This is called the Urban Heat Island Effect (UHIE) which results in local temperature increase due to accumulations of concrete and asphalt. A more accurate means of measuring global temperatures is by satellites that map most of the earth\u2019s surface. The influences of UHIE are small due to urban areas being such a small portion of the earth\u2019s area.\n\nProfessors John Christy and Roy Spencer of the University of Alabama (Huntsville) post global temperature data for the period from December 1979 to present. Their data is shown as a temperature anomaly which is the difference between measured temperatures and the 30-year average temperature from 1981 to 2010. The three warmest annual temperatures from 1979 were 0.420 degree C. for 1998, 0.400 for 2010, and 0.275 for 2014. Over the 204 months that span 1998 to 2014, 50 months were higher than the corresponding month in 2014. Clearly 2014 was not the warmest year in the period of satellite temperature measurements from 1980 to 2014.\n\nSatellite temperature data for January 2015 was 0.35 degrees C. Temperatures for 1998 was 0.47, 2007 was 0.42, 2010 was 0.56, and 2013 was 0.51. Clearly January 2015 was fifth warmest in the 37 years of satellite measurements.\n\nThe satellite data shows essentially a pause in global warming since 1998 or a period of 17 years. During this period atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increased the highest rate (2 parts per million per year) in thousands of years.\n\nOne of the sources of surface temperature data is the United States Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) which gives temperature data in the contiguous United States. Walter Dnes wrote an essay \u201cUSHCN Monthly Temperature Adjustments\u201d which gives references 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 that describe in detail monthly adjustments to USHCN data from 1872-to-present. These adjustments made present temperatures warmer, earlier temperatures cooler, and eliminated the 1930s period of heat waves and droughts.\n\nIn the United States there has been no media attention to global temperature adjustments and the population assumes all news reports true. Reporters take advocacy roles carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels causes global warming.\n\nThe United Kingdom has been exceptional in reporting news of bogus temperature data. British journalist James Delingpole wrote the January 30, 2015 article \u201cFORGET CLIMATEGATE: THIS \u2018GLOBAL WARMING\u2019 SCANDAL IS MUCH BIGGER\u201d which points out the world\u2019s three surface data sources for global temperatures have adjusted their raw data. The sources are NASA-GISS, NOAA which maintains the dataset known as the Global Historical Climate Network, and the University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit and Met Office data records known as Hadcrut. Mr. Delingpole found no satisfactory reasons for temperature adjustments.\n\nThe British \u201cThe Global Warming Policy Foundation\u201d sends newsletters around the world to inform the public about news regarding global warming and attempts at mitigation. Its February 9, 2015 newsletter The Biggest Science Scandal Ever refers to three recent publications about adjustments to global temperature data:\n\nThe first article is \u201cThe Fiddling With Temperature Data Is The Biggest Science Scandal Ever\u201d by Christopher Booker in The Sunday Telegraph, 8 February 2015. Mr. Booker points out temperature data in the Arctic were adjusted to eliminate warming 75 years ago that caused greater ice melting than seen today.\n\nThe second article by Paul Homewood \u201cTemperature Adjustments Transform Arctic Climate History\u201d Not A Lot Of People Know That, 4 February 2015 describes in detail temperature adjustments made to Arctic temperature stations by NASA-GISS. Almost every temperature measuring station from Greenland in the west to the middle of Siberia in the east was altered to eliminate strong warming in the early 1940s followed by cooling. This provided NASA-GISS with argumenta global warming takes place today from unprecedented Arctic ice melting.\n\nThe third article \u201cGlobally Averaged Land Surface Temperatures, 1900-2014 (GHCN) Sea Level Info, 9 February 2015 by Dan Burton describes arguments by Dr. Kevin Cowtan that NOAA\u2019s adjustments are correct are in fact wrong. Examining Dr. Cowtan\u2019s own data that he claimed inconsequential adjustments showed the warming from 1900 to 2014 was increased by 35 percent.\n\nFor another point of view of the controversy over global warming, the Global Warming Policy Foundation published a paper February 10, 2015 by Bernie Lewins \u201cHerbert Lamb and The Transformation Of Climate Science\u201d which re-examined the legacy of the father of British climatology Hubert Lamb (1913-1997). \u201cAfter leading and establishing historical climatology during the 1960s, Hubert Lamb became the founding Director of the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia (CRU). What is not widely known is that, in contrast to current research directions at CRU, its founding director was an early and vocal climate sceptic. Against the idea that greenhouse gas emissions were (or would soon be) noticeably warming the planet, Lamb raised objections on many levels. \u2018His greatest concern was not so much the lack of science behind the theory,\u2019 Mr. Lewin said, \u2018it was how the growing preoccupation with man-made warming was distorting the science.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe winter of 2015 is becoming one of the coldest and greatest snow-laden winters in United States history with global warming alarmists still maintaining global warming taking place. The mainstream media supports this claim. \u201cDisgraced NBC news anchor Brian Williams said it is \u201cdifficult to reconcile in the dead of winter,\u201d when he reported on Jan. 16, the misleading claim that 2014 was the warmest year on record.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press Science Writer Seth Borenstein has been the source of NOAA and NASA-GISS temperature data fed to the general public. In light of adjustments to global temperature data that allowed some reporters to cite 2014 the warmest year in recorded history, it is fitting reporter Seth Borenstein be nominated for the Brian Williams 2015 Award For Accuracy in Science Reporting.\n\nAdvocates for energy policies to mitigate non-existent global warming caused by carbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels such as President Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan use global temperature data as the main argument for their actions. It is senseless to use such questionable data for making decisions that have economic costs of trillions of dollars and lead to lower living standards for those in the United States. Of possibly even greater consequences are these policies condemn those living in poor countries to perpetual poverty. It was abundant, cheap fossil fuels of coal, oil, and natural gas that uplifted developed nations from the drudgery, misery, and shortened lifespans of the eighteenth century and earlier.\n\nPerhaps the best response to the falsification of global temperatures is the June 9, 1954 words of attorney Joseph Welch during the 30th day of the McCarthy-Army hearings in which Senator Joseph McCarthy unjustly accused Americans of being dangerous Communists. Mr. Welch said, \u201cYou have done enough. Have you no sense of decency, Sir?\u201d Within months of Joseph Welch\u2019s comment, Senator McCarthy was disgraced and ruined. This hypocrisy of false global temperature data to push the end of fossil fuel use must end.\n\nCongress should hold hearings to determine the veracity of global temperature data. The nation should not waste money having two different agencies collecting global temperature data. NASA-GISS should be eliminated and NASA returned to its mission of studying aeronautics and space exploration. Those involved with promoting advocacy over science and altering temperature data should suffer consequences.\n\nA hundred years from now, historians will look back on the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries and wonder if a universal madness had overcome the planet. The numerous environmental groups, like fleas on a dog, promoting burning fossil fuels caused catastrophic global warming will have some soul-searching explaining to do. Politicians who succumbed to the same reasoning will suffer a similar fate.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2015/02/noaa-and-nasa-giss-you-have-done-enough/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/GPS_Satellite_NASA_art-iif.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "NOAA AND NASA-GISS, \u2018You Have Done Enough\u2019"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf92e\"", "article_summary": "One of the sources of surface temperature data is the United States Historical Climatology Network (USHCN) which gives temperature data in the contiguous United States.\nThe British \u201cThe Global Warming Policy Foundation\u201d sends newsletters around the world to inform the public about news regarding global warming and attempts at mitigation.\nThis provided NASA-GISS with argumenta global warming takes place today from unprecedented Arctic ice melting.\nThe second article by Paul Homewood \u201cTemperature Adjustments Transform Arctic Climate History\u201d Not A Lot Of People Know That, 4 February 2015 describes in detail temperature adjustments made to Arctic temperature stations by NASA-GISS.\nProfessors John Christy and Roy Spencer of the University of Alabama (Huntsville) post global temperature data for the period from December 1979 to present."}
