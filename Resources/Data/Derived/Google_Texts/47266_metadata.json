The findings also provide a tacit boost to the federal Affordable Care Act, which mimicked some of the reforms underway in Minnesota when it was signed into law by President Obama in 2010.\n\n\u201cThis is the way to go to improve quality, improve patient satisfaction and lower cost,\u201d said Dr. Ed Ehlinger, state health commissioner.\n\nMelissa Winger, whose 18-year-old son suffers from a variety of conditions due to abnormal development of his internal organs, described how the new strategy has improved his care. She takes him to a pediatric health care home, which is more efficient because his doctor collaborates with specialists on appointments and tests to avoid redundancies. Her son used to require 60 medical appointments a year, she said, and missed 30 days of school in the process.\n\n2008 reforms Health reforms enacted by the 2008 Legislature included incentives for doctors and clinics to improve coordination of patient care and grants to local communities to promote exercise and healthy eating.\n\nUnder the coordinated approach, she said, he misses no more than five school days annually and avoids clinics and hospitals, where the proximity to other sick people could expose him to infections.\n\n\u201cHe is healthier because his problems are managed better,\u201d Winger said.\n\nFour in 10\n\nThe U analysis compared costs of medical services from 2010 through 2012 for a group of patients on the state\u2019s Medical Assistance program who used health care homes against those who used traditional primary care clinics. The average cost for patients in health care homes was $2,588, while the average cost for patients in traditional clinics was $2,850.\n\nSpread across the entire Minnesota health care system, efficiencies like that could produce hundreds of millions of dollars in savings for patients, taxpayers and businesses.\n\nAlready more than four in 10 primary care doctors serve in state-certified health care homes, and collectively they serve 3.3 million patients.\n\nEhlinger said the long-term success of health care homes will likely require a greater number of insurers and large self-insured employers agreeing to pay doctors for the care coordination services they provide under this approach.\n\nSwitching to a health care home model requires clinics to make upfront investments: Some hire coordinators who provide follow-up care, such as calling depressed patients to ensure they are taking prescribed medications.\n\nThe state Medical Assistance program and some private-sector insurers currently support health care homes with monthly payments ranging from $10 to $60 per patient for care coordination. The amount varies by the patients\u2019 needs and illness levels.\n\nThose costs weren\u2019t factored into the U analysis, so the total cost of caring for patients in health care homes is slightly higher than indicated, said Douglas Wholey, a U researcher who led the study. He expects more evidence of savings, though, as he continues to track health care homes over the next two years.\n\nBusy doctors\n\nThe concept of health care homes has been obscure to some patients and confusing to others, who figured doctors were already coordinating their medical care. But doctors under the traditional pay-per-service model of U.S. health care often had little time for such oversight as they hopped from exam room to exam room and patient to patient.\n\n\u201cThis has completely changed the way I have been able to practice in the office,\u201d said Dr. Kris Kopski, medical director of innovations for the Park Nicollet Health Services.\n\nThursday\u2019s reports, which were required as part of the legislation that approved health care home funding, also showed patients in better health.\n\nAmong asthmatic adults, 42 percent using health care homes in 2011 had optimal control of their diseases, compared with only 23 percent using traditional clinics. Patients with vascular diseases such as clogged arteries were also much more likely to have ideal levels of cholesterol and blood pressure if they were using health care homes.\n\nWinger serves on a family council that supports the state health care home project. One of the benefits, she said, is that doctors in health care homes must consult patients about their care goals up front.\n\n\u201cNot everybody that has the exact same chronic condition has the exact same life,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have different goals. They have different interests.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "A new model of primary care that emphasizes disease prevention and doctor-patient collaboration appears to be lowering Minnesota&rsquo;s medical costs while raising the quality of care patients receive.", "title": "Minnesota's new way of seeing patients has improved health care results, researchers say", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-s-new-way-of-seeing-patients-linked-to-improved-health-care/246360021/", "image": {"url": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464031764", "width": 1680, "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464031764", "height": 876}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "A new model of primary care that emphasizes disease prevention and doctor-patient collaboration appears to be lowering Minnesota&rsquo;s medical costs while raising the quality of care patients receive.", "title": "Minnesota's new way of seeing patients has improved health care results, researchers say", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-s-new-way-of-seeing-patients-linked-to-improved-health-care/246360021/", "image": {"src": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464031764", "identifier": "http://assets.startribune.com/static/img/branding/logos/strib-social-card.png?d=1464031764"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A new model of primary care that emphasizes disease prevention and doctor-patient collaboration appears to be lowering Minnesota&rsquo;s medical costs while raising the quality of care patients receive."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd19a\"", "article_summary": "Video (02:36) : New model of health care homes helps with complex patients says Dr. Kris Kopski, of Park Nicollet Health Care System.\nAlready more than four in 10 primary care doctors serve in state-certified health care homes, and collectively they serve 3.3 million patients.\nOne of the benefits, she said, is that doctors in health care homes must consult patients about their care goals up front.\nThe average cost for patients in health care homes was $2,588, while the average cost for patients in traditional clinics was $2,850.\nHe expects more evidence of savings, though, as he continues to track health care homes over the next two years."}
