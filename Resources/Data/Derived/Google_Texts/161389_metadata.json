They also help with documenting a historically significant wreck over time.\n\nThe seaplane had a wing span of 100 feet, about comparable to a modern-era Boeing 727 commercial jet. It now sits in pieces 30 feet below the surface in Kaneohe Bay next to a Marine Corps base, about 20 miles east of Pearl Harbor on the other side of Oahu.\n\nThere were an estimated six of these planes \u2014 also called \u201cflying boats\u201d \u2014 in the bay at the time of the attack, but Van Tilburg said nobody is sure what happened to the others.\n\nThe base, which was then a naval air station, was among several Oahu military installations attacked by Japanese planes on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941.\n\nVan Tilburg said a mooring cable is still attached to the plane, but there are signs someone started the port engine before the plane sank. This indicates a crew may have died while attempting to take off as the aerial assault began.\n\nThe Catalina PBY-5 could hold an eight-man crew, and four 500-pound bombs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "New images show seaplane that sank in Pearl Harbor attack", "title": "New images show seaplane that sank in Pearl Harbor attack", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "New images show seaplane that sank in Pearl Harbor attack", "title": "New images show seaplane that sank in Pearl Harbor attack", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/05/new_images_show_seaplane_that_sank_in_pearl_harbor_attack_2/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/pearl-harbor-attack-seaplane.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "New images show seaplane that sank in Pearl Harbor attack", "title": "New images show seaplane that sank in Pearl Harbor attack", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/pearl-harbor-attack-seaplane.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Audrey Mcavoy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Van Tilburg said a mooring cable is still attached to the plane, but there are signs someone started the port engine before the plane sank.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsHONOLULU (AP) \u2014 New images of a large U.S. Navy seaplane that sank in Hawaii waters during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor show a coral-encrusted engine and reef fish swimming in and out of a hull.\nThe video and photos are the clearest images taken of the Catalina PBY-5 wreckage to date, said Hans Van Tilburg, a maritime archaeologist with the Office of National Marine Sanctuaries.\nThe site isn\u2019t publicly accessible, so the images allow scientists to share the wreckage with others.\nThere were an estimated six of these planes \u2014 also called \u201cflying boats\u201d \u2014 in the bay at the time of the attack, but Van Tilburg said nobody is sure what happened to the others."}
