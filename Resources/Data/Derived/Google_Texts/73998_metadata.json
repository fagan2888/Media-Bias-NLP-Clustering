It will also be available for Microsoft's Xbox One, Xbox 360 and on the PC, as well as Nintendo's Wii and 3DS. As expected, EA will not release it for the Wii U.\n\nWhile the much-awaited game will be available on handheld gaming devices, such as the PS Vita and 3DS, these versions will not enjoy all the features of the full version, such as game updates. However, they will enjoy the legacy edition of the game with new squads and updated players.\n\nIt was also no surprise that the franchise will cease to cater to Sony's PlayStation 2 despite previously releasing versions for the rather old yet iconic gaming console. The PlayStation 2 provided a stable platform for the FIFA gaming franchise for a solid 14 years.\n\nAccording to reports, \"FIFA 15 Ultimate Team Legends\" will be exclusively available for Xbox One, while no reports indicate content exclusive to the PlayStation 4. This edition's cover art was leaked last week, and the game has been confirmed as exclusive to Microsoft's next-gen console.\n\nFIFA 15 will be available in the United States on Sept. 23 and in the U.K. on Sept. 26.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The title will ride gamers' excitement.", "Copyright": "2016 Latin Post", "Author": "Latin Post", "og": {"site_name": "Latin Post", "description": "The title will ride gamers' excitement.", "title": "EA Sports FIFA '15 Release Date, Xbox One vs. PS4: World Cup Game Available for Xbox 360, PC, PS3, PS Vita, PSP, Nintendo Wii and 3DS", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/15960/20140629/ea-sports-fifa-15-release-date-xbox-one-vs-ps4-video-game-versions-include-xbox-360-pc-ps3-ps-vita-psp-wii-3ds.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/13489/fifa-15.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "latinpost.com", "description": "The title will ride gamers' excitement.", "creator": "@latinpost", "url": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/15960/20140629/ea-sports-fifa-15-release-date-xbox-one-vs-ps4-video-game-versions-include-xbox-360-pc-ps3-ps-vita-psp-wii-3ds.htm", "image": "http://images.latinpost.com/data/images/full/13489/fifa-15.jpg", "title": "EA Sports FIFA '15 Release Date, Xbox One vs. PS4: World Cup Game Available for Xbox 360, PC, PS3, PS Vita, PSP, Nintendo Wii and 3DS", "site": "@latinpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.latinpost.com/articles/15960/20140629/ea-sports-fifa-15-release-date-xbox-one-vs-ps4-video-game-versions-include-xbox-360-pc-ps3-ps-vita-psp-wii-3ds.htm", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "35e478f7510504ec71abd594218dee4e"}, "Keywords": "Latin Post", "Googlebot-News": "index, follow", "Title": "Latin Post", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-29"}, "Subject": "Latin Post", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ea, sports, fifa, 15, release, date, xbox, one, vs, ps4, video, game, versions, include, xbox, 360, pc, ps3, ps, vita, psp, wii, 3ds"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf478\"", "article_summary": "\"FIFA 15\" will be available for most gaming platforms and consoles, including Sony's PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PS Vita and PSP.\nIt will also be available for Microsoft's Xbox One, Xbox 360 and on the PC, as well as Nintendo's Wii and 3DS.\nFIFA 15 will be available in the United States on Sept. 23 and in the U.K. on Sept. 26.\nThe PlayStation 2 provided a stable platform for the FIFA gaming franchise for a solid 14 years.\nAccording to reports, \"FIFA 15 Ultimate Team Legends\" will be exclusively available for Xbox One, while no reports indicate content exclusive to the PlayStation 4."}
