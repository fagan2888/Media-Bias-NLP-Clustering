But what\u2019s really scary is that the rest of the GOP field agrees with him. Because Trump is leading in the polls, the other Republican candidates are competing with each other to see who can echo his message the loudest.\u201d\n\nThe site also debunks other GOP claims, such as voter fraud (\u201cOnly 0.00000013 percent of votes cast from 2002-2005 resulted in convictions or guilty pleas for voter fraud\u201d) and refugees (\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be nice to spend Thanksgiving talking about how to make our country more welcoming \u2026\u201d).\n\nIt may not completely prevent tempers from flaring, nor will it change anyone\u2019s mind in the long run, but having facts handy could prevent politics from spoiling an otherwise happy Thanksgiving.\n\nAnd for that, nearly everyone could give thanks.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Florida Politics", "description": "For most people, holidays are supposed to be filled with fun,\u00a0food and celebration.
