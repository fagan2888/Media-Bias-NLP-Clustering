It was surprising to see Peter Dobrin’s inaccurate suggestion that The Pew Center for Arts and Heritage is the only way that the Pew Charitable Trusts contributes to arts and culture in Philadelphia (“Time to speak up, ante up for art,” Nov 3).

As we explained to him repeatedly in the course of his reporting, The Pew Charitable Trusts’ support for local arts and culture extends beyond the work of the center. While The Pew Center for Arts and Heritage is Pew’s primary vehicle to fund projects by artists and arts and heritage organizations in the southeastern Pennsylvania area, the Trusts constantly looks for additional ways to fund arts and culture in Philadelphia. For example, we have been pleased to work with our partners to provide financial assistance to organizations such as the Barnes Foundation, Opera Philadelphia and the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance.

Of course, our city has many other needs and opportunities as well. As part of our ongoing commitment to Philadelphia, our Board of Directors provides resources for a wide range of local projects, including investments in arts and cultural programs as well as support for organizations that care for vulnerable individuals and families; for the Philadelphia research initiative, which prepares nonpartisan, fact-based analyses of city issues; and for compelling civic opportunities. We continue to be committed to serving the needs of the city’s residents, attracting visitors to the region, and finding new ways to enhance Philadelphia’s quality of life.
