(AP) - A Boca production of \u201cHello Dolly\u201d is breaking ground with a male actor taking on the iconic lead role made famous by Carol Channing and Barbra Streisand.\n\nBoca Raton\u2019s Wick Theatre had to get special permission from composer Jerry Herman. The Sun-Sentinel (http://tinyurl.com/ncy7cx2) reports it will be the first production in the U.S. where the role of Dolly Levi has been played by a man. Danny La Rue took on the role in England in 1982. This time around, Lee Roy Reams is stepping into the part.\n\nReams is friends with the composer, who lives in Miami Beach, and decided to pay him a visit to get his blessing. It might have helped that the theater had recently done two of Herman\u2019s most popular shows - \u201cMame\u201d and \u201cLa Cage aux Folles.\u201d\n\nReams has also starred opposite Channing twice in the Tony-award winning show and has even directed it.\n\n\u201cI love this show,\u201d Reams says. \u201cIt was my second show with Carol Channing. When I was in \u2018Lorelei\u2019 with Carol we became close. When they were doing a revival she called me. That voice. She said, \u2018Hello Lee Roy. It\u2019s Carol.\u2019 Like I didn\u2019t know. She said, \u2018Look, I want you to play Cornelius Hackl. The director doesn\u2019t know you, so you have to audition. But don\u2019t worry, you got the job.\u2019 \u201c\n\nChanning also asked him to direct the last Broadway revival in 1994.\n\nThe musical, which has won 10 Tony Awards since debuting on Broadway in 1964, tells the story of a matchmaker who sweeps into the staid lives of a Yonkers store owner and his staff, as well as two ladies in a New York millinery. Streisand played Dolly in the 1969 movie version directed by Gene Kelly.\n\n\u201cYou know David Merrick, the original producer, wanted Jack Benny to play Dolly and George Burns to play Horace Vandergelder (Dolly\u2019s romantic lead). They turned him down. Then he wanted Liberace to play Dolly and he turned him down. The idea has always been there. It was just finding the producer brave enough to do it,\u201d he said.\n\nReams credits Marilynn A. Wick, the theatre\u2019s founder, for taking the risk. The show runs through Dec. 6.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere is prime. It\u2019s time. People are no longer being told what they should play,\u201d said Reams. \u201cPeople can play all kinds of roles now, regardless (of) their sexual orientation or ethnicity. I think we\u2019re all more open to that now.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Sun Sentinel , http://www.sun-sentinel.com/", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Boca production of \"Hello Dolly\" is breaking ground with a male actor taking on the iconic lead role made famous by Carol Channing and Barbra Streisand.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/7/male-actor-to-play-iconic-lead-in-hello-dolly/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "A Boca production of \u201cHello Dolly\u201d is breaking ground with a male actor taking on the iconic lead role made famous by Carol Channing and Barbra Streisand.", "title": "Male actor to play iconic lead in \u201cHello Dolly\u201d"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "A Boca production of \"Hello Dolly\" is breaking ground with a male actor taking on the iconic lead role made famous by Carol Channing and Barbra Streisand.", "card": "summary", "title": "Male actor to play iconic lead in \u201cHello Dolly\u201d"}, "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "BOCA RATON, Fla.
