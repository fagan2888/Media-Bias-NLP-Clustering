Tim Scott (R-SC), and Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) are confirmed to speak at the upcoming American Conservative Union (ACU) hosted Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), the organization told Breitbart News exclusively on Friday.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cRepresentative Blackburn, Laura Ingraham, and Senator Scott have a proven track record of fighting for our shared conservative principles,\u201d ACU Chairman Matt Schlapp said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s on Capitol Hill, or on the airwaves, we are certain that these strong conservative leaders will assist our mission of equipping our attendees with the tools they need to be successful in their communities and campuses across America.\u201d\n\nScott, who has a lifetime ACU scorecard rating of 97 percent, said that this forthcoming CPAC is massively important in ensuring that a conservative\u2013not an establishment Republican\u2013gets the GOP nomination in 2016. Scott, who\u2019s a fairly quiet U.S. Senator compared to some of the other younger, reliable conservative Republicans, is black\u2013something that undercuts the left\u2019s narrative that Republicans or conservatives are somehow racist.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to represent the people of South Carolina, the folks who will host one of the first Presidential primaries,\u201d Scott said in the statement provided to Breitbart News. \u201cCPAC will be the unofficial launch of the Presidential campaign and our best opportunity to fight for a conservative candidate.\u201d\n\nIngraham has been one of the loudest conservative media figures in recent years, leading the charge almost single-handedly to help now Rep. David Brat (R-VA) beat the GOP establishment\u2019s now former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in his Republican primary. Ingraham has promised to seek the same fate for House Appropriations Committee chairman Rep. Hal Rogers (R-KY) for his work on Speaker John Boehner\u2019s behalf to fund President Barack Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\n\nIngraham said on her radio program on Thursday:\n\nHal Rogers, who\u2019s the Appropriations Chairman from Kentucky in House of Representatives, I have concluded needs to be primaried. Hal Rogers refuses to consider the sensible process of defunding Obama\u2019s executive amnesty and instead throws up all of these false road blocks to defunding Obama\u2019s executive amnesty, which we have exposed here on this show (like, \u2018You can\u2019t defund a program that\u2019s funded by fees.\u2019 When in fact, we have done it in the past, including last year more than a dozen times). Hal Rogers clearly wants executive amnesty to go through, so he\u2019s not going to fight on the funding as we need him to, and that\u2019s a betrayal of the American worker. He must be primaried. We need a strong advocate for the American worker from Kentucky to work for us and work for the people of Kentucky, so we\u2019re going to be working with our friends in Kentucky to try to find a suitable primary candidate for Hal Rogers. Lots of people are already contacting us and suggesting folks. Anything I can do to help, I\u2019ll be happy to help.\n\nThe United Kentucky Tea Party told Breitbart News previously that it is actively searching for a suitable primary candidate for Rogers, something that was subsequently highlighted by the New York Times.\n\nBlackburn, the third ACU speaker the group is announcing on Friday with this exclusive with Breitbart News, is the major House sponsor of legislation that passed the House of Representatives this past summer, right before August recess, that would have blocked funding for Obama\u2019s executive amnesty\u2013through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) 2012 executive amnesty or for this executive amnesty that the president announced a couple of weeks ago.\n\nBlackburn, who has a lifetime ACU scorecard rating of 96 percent\u2013the best rating in the entire Tennessee Congressional delegation\u2013said:\n\nI am honored to be a part of CPAC\u2019s growing roster of conservative opinion leaders. Conservative principles produce the best solutions for the challenges facing America. Our ideas provide opportunities for all Americans, not just the well-connected few. I look forward to discussing how best to implement our ideas at CPAC.\n\nBlackburn, who offered the House version of a bill from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), fought to ensure the House passed the bill\u2013which it did\u2013and in doing so, forced the Democrats such as Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi into a full-scale meltdown. Pelosi actually chased Republican Rep. Tom Marino (R-PA) across the floor of the House of Representatives, wagging her finger in his face, in an attempt to explain the Democrats\u2019 opposition to blocking funding for Obama\u2019s executive amnesties.\n\nCPAC 2015 will be held from Feb. 25 through Feb. 28 at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, MD, just outside of Washington, D.C.\n\nDespite some issues in previous years, the ACU under new chairman Matt Schlapp is clearly making efforts to cover issues conservatives care about\u2013especially on immigration. On a new \u201cRoad To CPAC\u201d feature on the ACU\u2019s CPAC website, the ACU has been making a new announcement every day on the way to CPAC\u2019s opening. Several of the posts have focused on immigration\u2013from highlighting Milton Friedman\u2019s speech about how open borders can\u2019t exist with a welfare state, to hammering Obama\u2019s executive amnesty announcement, to comparing Obamacare to \u201cObamnesty.\u201d\n\nOther speakers who have already been announced include Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Dr. Ben Carson, nationally syndicated radio host Mark Levin, and ACU Foundation chairwoman Carly Fiorina.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Exclusive -- Laura Ingraham, Sen.
