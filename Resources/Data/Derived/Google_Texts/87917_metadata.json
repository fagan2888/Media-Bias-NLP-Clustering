After his death, the famous Knights of the Round Table disbanded.\n\nTens of thousands of tourists from all over the world visit Glastonbury every year. Whether it will remain a top religious tours spot remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cWe are not in the business of destroying people\u2019s beliefs,\u201d said Gilchrist whose study spanned four years. \u201cA thousand years of beliefs and legends are part of the intangible history of this remarkable place.\u201d\n\nYS/AMB END GRUNDY", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Culture, Ethics, archaeologists, Glastonbury Abbey, King Arthur, monks", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.5.16", "og": {"site_name": "Religion News Service", "description": "CANTERBURY, England (RNS) The scholars concluded that the monks needed a lot of money to rebuild their famous abbey after a disastrous fire, so they invented the story that Arthur was buried there.", "title": "Archaeologists: Monks made up legends about King Arthur\u2019s burial site", "url": "http://religionnews.com/2015/11/25/archaeologists-monks-made-legends-king-arthurs-burial-site/", "image": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/thumbRNS-AURTHUR-BURIAL112515.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RNS", "card": "summary"}, "syndication-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/11/25/archaeologists-monks-made-legends-king-arthurs-burial-site/", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://religionnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-RNS_logo_RGB-336x336.gif", "original-source": "http://religionnews.com/2015/11/25/archaeologists-monks-made-legends-king-arthurs-burial-site/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "CANTERBURY, England (RNS) The scholars concluded that the monks needed a lot of money to rebuild their famous abbey after a disastrous fire, so they invented the story that Arthur was buried there."}, "article_summary": "\u201cA thousand years of beliefs and legends are part of the intangible history of this remarkable place.\u201dYS/AMB END GRUNDY\nAccording to Thomas Malory, an English writer, who wrote a book based on the king\u2019s legends, Arthur was taken to a nearby island \u2014 and today\u2019s Glastonbury Abbey \u2014 but doctors were unable to save his life.\n\u201cWe are not in the business of destroying people\u2019s beliefs,\u201d said Gilchrist whose study spanned four years.\nArchaeologists now say the story was invented to attract pilgrims.\nAfter his death, the famous Knights of the Round Table disbanded."}
