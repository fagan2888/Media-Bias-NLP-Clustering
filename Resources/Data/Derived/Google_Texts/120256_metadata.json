(AP) \u2014 A historic ski jump that once attracted up to 30,000 spectators and made New Hampshire an important winter sports destination after it opened in 1938 is getting a chance to soar again.\n\nThe Nansen Ski Jump in Milan lured some of the biggest names in jumping to the state\u2019s North Country for decades and was host to Olympic tryouts, World Cup competitions and four national championships before the last jumper flew off it in 1985.\n\nNow, an effort is underway to revive the dilapidated jump and make it a tourist attraction featuring story boards, a picnic area and observation platform at the takeoff point so visitors can get a jumper\u2019s eye view of the seemingly bottomless panorama. The timber and overgrown brush that have obscured the jump from view are scheduled to be cleared next spring and grant proposals are being written to develop the state park around it.\n\nThe 70-meter jump is a monument to the region\u2019s rich cultural history and the Scandinavians and Canadians who were brought in to clear forests for the nearby paper mills. They brought with them their devotion to skiing and ski jumping and championed the building of the jump by the Nansen Ski Club \u2014 the oldest continuously operating ski club in the country, formed in 1872.\n\nThe club\u2019s membership was initially restricted to Scandinavian men and its meetings were conducted in Norwegian. It eventually eased the restrictions in deference to Canadian winter sports devotees lured to jobs at the paper mills.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of history, a lot of interest and a lot of potential,\u201d said Vaughn Roy, 72, of Berlin. He said he first worked up the courage to go off the jump at age 17 and made about 75 jumps in all.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exhilarating,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tower is pretty intimidating and sways in the wind. The view is tremendous. When you\u2019re in the air, you feel like you\u2019re floating.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Plans afoot to fix historic New Hampshire ski jump", "title": "Plans afoot to fix historic New Hampshire ski jump", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Plans afoot to fix historic New Hampshire ski jump", "title": "Plans afoot to fix historic New Hampshire ski jump", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/11/plans_afoot_to_fix_historic_new_hampshire_ski_jump/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/historic-ski-jump.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Plans afoot to fix historic New Hampshire ski jump", "title": "Plans afoot to fix historic New Hampshire ski jump", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/historic-ski-jump.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Lynne Tuohy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4792\"", "article_summary": "They brought with them their devotion to skiing and ski jumping and championed the building of the jump by the Nansen Ski Club \u2014 the oldest continuously operating ski club in the country, formed in 1872.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsBERLIN, N.H.
