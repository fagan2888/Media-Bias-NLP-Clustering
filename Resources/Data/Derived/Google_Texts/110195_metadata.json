Officials for the airline said they hoped to charge as little as $150 each way. Such exemptions are usually granted European carriers under a U.S.-European Union aviation agreement.\n\nNorwegian Air International is a subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle, a low-cost carrier founded in 1993 and headquartered in Fornebu, Norway. The parent company has 417 routes to 126 destinations. Most of those routes are in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, but it also flies some long-haul flights to the U.S. and Southeast Asia.\n\nIts subsidiary, Norwegian Air International, plans to register its planes in Ireland, an EU member, to take advantage of the U.S.-EU treaty that extends many privileges granted domestic carriers to each other\u2019s airlines. That also would make Ireland responsible for the airline\u2019s safety oversight even though the carrier hasn\u2019t announced any plans to fly into or out of Ireland. The airline also plans to hire flight crews through a Singapore hiring agency and base them in Thailand.\n\nU.S. airlines and pilot unions in the U.S. and Europe vigorously campaigned against the exemption, saying Norwegian Air International would set a dangerous precedent by driving down wages and undermining the ability of U.S. airlines to compete in the global market. Ed Wytkind, head of the AFL-CIO\u2019s Transportation Trades Department, recently accused Norwegian Air of trying to \u201cusher in a Walmart-style race to the bottom for cheap labor.\u201d\n\nCritics also questioned the ability of Irish authorities to safely oversee planes and pilots that are only available at distant locations. Dozens of members of Congress signed letters to the Transportation Department opposing the exemption.\n\nNorwegian officials, however, said the large airline mergers and establishment of global airline alliances in recent years have undermined competition and created great pent-up consumer demand for the cheaper air travel they want to offer.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a case that has labor and trade policy implications, the Obama administration on Tuesday rejected a request that would have immediately permitted a low-cost air carrier to begin flights between the U.S. and Europe while the government is still reviewing its application for new service.", "pubdate": 20140902, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "In a case that has labor and trade policy implications, the Obama administration on Tuesday rejected a request that would have immediately permitted a low-cost air carrier to begin flights between the U.S. and Europe while the government is still reviewing its application for new service.", "title": "U.S. rejects bid for low-cost U.S.-Europe flights", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/13272474233_36e3af0f59_o.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/us-rejects-bid-low-cost-us-europe-flights/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "In a case that has labor and trade policy implications, the Obama administration on Tuesday rejected a request that would have immediately permitted a low-cost air carrier to begin flights between the U.S. and Europe while the government is still reviewing its application for new service.", "creator": "@newshour", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/13272474233_36e3af0f59_o.jpg", "title": "U.S. rejects bid for low-cost U.S.-Europe flights", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "transatlantic flight"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "department of transportation, Norwegian air international, transatlantic flight"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd28af\"", "article_summary": "Norwegian Air International is a subsidiary of Norwegian Air Shuttle, a low-cost carrier founded in 1993 and headquartered in Fornebu, Norway.\nThe airline also plans to hire flight crews through a Singapore hiring agency and base them in Thailand.\nIts subsidiary, Norwegian Air International, plans to register its planes in Ireland, an EU member, to take advantage of the U.S.-EU treaty that extends many privileges granted domestic carriers to each other\u2019s airlines.\nMost of those routes are in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, but it also flies some long-haul flights to the U.S. and Southeast Asia.\nOfficials for the airline said they hoped to charge as little as $150 each way."}
