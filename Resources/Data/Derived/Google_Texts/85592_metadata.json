The auditors concluded that VA primary care wait times at a facility in Phoenix averaged 115 days.\n\nRelated: Meet the Independent Watchdog Taking on the VA\n\n\u201cThe truth is that when people get into the VA, the quality of care is good. The problem that we have to address is access to the system and waiting lines,\u201d Sanders said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation.\n\nThe Vermont senator\u2019s bill would make it easier for veterans to receive treatment outside of the VA, such as in community hospitals or from private doctors, if they can\u2019t access care in a timely manner. The measure also addresses VA doctor shortages by offering college loan forgiveness to attract medical care providers and requests additional funding to hire more doctors.\n\nThe Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee will hold a hearing Thursday to discuss Sanders\u2019 bill. It\u2019s likely to face resistance from Republicans, however, as it requires additional spending, and right now it\u2019s quite unclear how much the Sanders bill would cost.\n\nA similar VA reform bill, sponsored earlier this year by Sanders, was projected to cost $21 billion over the next decade. It failed to drum up enough GOP support in February, since it included additional spending and extended the eligibility period from 5 years to 10 years after deployment. Republicans said the bill would add more veterans to a system already plagued by backlog and wait times.\n\nRelated: Vets Blow the Whistle on Negligent VA Management\n\nGOP lawmakers aren\u2019t likely to support any major increases to the VA\u2019s budget this time, either. The VA, the second largest federal agency behind the Department of Defense and the nation\u2019s largest health care and benefits provider, has an overall budget of $165 billion for fiscal year 2015 \u2013 $60 billion of which is for health care.\n\nMeanwhile, House Republicans passed their own bill last month to address the negligence and mismanagement within the VA.\n\nHouse Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller (R-FL) introduced the bill after CNN reported that a VA facility in Phoenix was keeping hidden wait lists of veterans seeking medical care. The legislation, which received overwhelming bipartisan support, would give the VA secretary authority to fire officials and executives within the system over performance issues. The measure from Sanders includes a similar provision, though he has some issues with the House bill.\n\n\u201cThe nightmare could be under the current bill that passed the House that a new president comes in and they fire hundreds of high-ranking VA officials without due process or particular reason,\u201d Sanders told The Washington Post last week. \u201cI think you cannot run a health care system the size of the VA like that. You want to be able to get rid of people at the VA who are incompetent in a very rapid way, but you have to have due process.\u201d\n\nRep. Miller is also crafting legislation to make it easier for veterans to get treatment in facilities outside of the VA if they\u2019ve been waiting more than 30 days.\n\nThe bills are likely to face an uphill battle in both chambers, where the two parties are at odds over spending and the potential privatization of VA health care.\n\nOne obvious idea, mentioned in Forbes, called for Medicare to pick up the care for elderly vets, thus making room for more critical cases from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Although the author didn\u2019t suggest it, a \u201cVetigap\u201d plan could cover the difference in costs at a much lower rate than some of the other options.\n\nVeterans groups, meanwhile, have their own plan to reform the VA \u2013 including some provisions taken from both the House and Senate bills.\n\nOn Monday, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) proposed a handful of ideas, including appointing a post-9/11 veteran to succeed Shinseki as VA secretary. The group supports both Sanders\u2019 provision to increase funding and the House bill to allow the secretary to easily boot out agency officials for performance issues. They\u2019re also calling for Congress to approve more funding for the VA and to partner with nonprofit groups to help \u201cfill in the gaps when the agency is struggling to meet demands.\u201d\n\nThe IAVA has been quick to respond to the VA scandal. Just two weeks ago, the group partnered with an independent watchdog firm to create a VA whistleblower website that VA employees, patients and doctors can use to report any wrongdoings they witness at any of the VA facilities across the country.\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Ever since President Obama accepted the resignation of former Veterans Affairs Secreta", "title": "Lots of Ideas, No Quick Fix for VA Health Care", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/03/Lots-Ideas-No-Quick-Fix-VA-Health-Care", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/05292014_VA.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/03/Lots-Ideas-No-Quick-Fix-VA-Health-Care", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/columns/05292014_VA.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Ever since President Obama accepted the resignation of former Veterans Affairs Secreta", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd02ca\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think you cannot run a health care system the size of the VA like that.\nThe bills are likely to face an uphill battle in both chambers, where the two parties are at odds over spending and the potential privatization of VA health care.\nThe auditors concluded that VA primary care wait times at a facility in Phoenix averaged 115 days.\nThe VA, the second largest federal agency behind the Department of Defense and the nation\u2019s largest health care and benefits provider, has an overall budget of $165 billion for fiscal year 2015 \u2013 $60 billion of which is for health care.\nOn Monday, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) proposed a handful of ideas, including appointing a post-9/11 veteran to succeed Shinseki as VA secretary."}
