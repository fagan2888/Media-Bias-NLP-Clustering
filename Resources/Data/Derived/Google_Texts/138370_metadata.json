This is the first time the Supreme Court has declared businesses can hold religious views under federal law.\n\nProtester Pam Arterburn of Rancho Cucamonga said she\u2019s concerned about the effect the decision has on women.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s restricting women\u2019s health,\u201d she said, adding an employer\u2019s beliefs are infringing on a woman\u2019s decision about her health in addition to overriding her own beliefs and values..\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s religion counts? Just the company owners? Shouldn\u2019t the employee\u2019s religion count?\u201d Arterburn asked.\n\nVidaurri said the head of the family-owned company opposes the use of certain types of contraceptives including some intrauterine devices, or IUDs. Yet the company sells a large quantity of merchandise that\u2019s manufactured in China, a country where abortion and IUDs help couples meet the government\u2019s policy of one child per family.\n\nIf David Green, the company\u2019s chief executive officer and founder, feels so strongly about the use of IUDs \u201cwhy would he do business with (China) and get all his products from this country?\u201d Vidaurri asked.\n\nMike Tait of Rancho Cucamonga disagreed with some of the protesters\u2019 points of view and stopped to debate the matter.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think attacking religious freedom is what we should be doing in our country,\u201d he said after talking with protesters.\n\nThe company is a privately held business, Tait said, and it would be different if it were a publicly held company.\n\n\u201cIf this is the company owner\u2019s position to object to these methods of contraception, then that\u2019s his moral right,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what this country is about, to be able to run their company based on their moral convictions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHobby Lobby\u2019s website carried a statement about the court\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cOur family is overjoyed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision,\u201d Barbara Green, co-founder of Hobby Lobby said in the statement. On Monday \u201cthe nation\u2019s highest court has re-affirmed the vital importance of religious liberty as one of our country\u2019s founding principles. The Court\u2019s decision is a victory, not just for our family business, but for all who seek to live out their faith. We are grateful to God and to those who have supported us on this difficult journey.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "RANCHO CUCAMONGA >> A handful of protesters, signs in hand, gathered in front of the Hobby Lobby Store here Saturday to protest the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling involving the national craft store chain and its policy on contraceptives.", "title": "Small group in Rancho Cucamonga protests court ruling involving Hobby Lobby, contraceptives", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailybulletin.com/government-and-politics/20140705/small-group-in-rancho-cucamonga-protests-court-ruling-involving-hobby-lobby-contraceptives", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailybulletin.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LF/20140705/NEWS/140709705/AR/0/AR-140709705.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1000px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Small group in Rancho Cucamonga protests court ruling involving Hobby Lobby, contraceptives"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailybulletin.com", "description": "RANCHO CUCAMONGA >> A handful of protesters, signs in hand, gathered in front of the Hobby Lobby Store here Saturday to protest the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling involving the national craft store chain and its policy on contraceptives.", "title": "Small group in Rancho Cucamonga protests court ruling involving Hobby Lobby, contraceptives", "url": "http://www.dailybulletin.com/government-and-politics/20140705/small-group-in-rancho-cucamonga-protests-court-ruling-involving-hobby-lobby-contraceptives", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailybulletin.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LF/20140705/NEWS/140709705/AR/0/AR-140709705.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ivdailybulletin", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551776550", "iphone": "id503648014", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.inlandvalleydailybulletin"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "Hobby Lobby,Rancho Cucamonga,SCOTUS, United States Supreme Court decisions", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Hobby Lobby,Rancho Cucamonga,SCOTUS, United States Supreme Court decisions"}, "article_summary": "Mike Tait of Rancho Cucamonga disagreed with some of the protesters\u2019 points of view and stopped to debate the matter.\n\u201cOur family is overjoyed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision,\u201d Barbara Green, co-founder of Hobby Lobby said in the statement.\nAttempts to reach a representatives of Hobby Lobby on Saturday were unsuccessful.\nThe Court\u2019s decision is a victory, not just for our family business, but for all who seek to live out their faith.\nProtester Pam Arterburn of Rancho Cucamonga said she\u2019s concerned about the effect the decision has on women."}
