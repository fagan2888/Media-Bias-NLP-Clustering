Soon Kanter and Westbrook were running the pick-and-roll like they\u2019d been playing together for years.\n\nA rejuvenated Kanter is averaging 15.5 points and 9.4 rebounds while shooting 55 percent from the field since being traded. His smile broadens while he raves about his new point guard and mentor.\n\n\u201cI have no words,\u201d Kanter said. \u201cHe has been unbelievable. He is helping his teammates, he is scoring the ball, and he is rebounding. He has been really good.\u201d\n\nThis season, in an 11-game stretch that reigning MVP Kevin Durant has missed with pain in his surgically repaired right foot, Westbrook has scored 30 points or more seven times and posted six triple-doubles to force his way into this year\u2019s MVP discussion.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, it should: A year ago, it was Westbrook who was out. Durant went on a glorious two-month run, averaging 35 points while Westbrook recovered from knee surgery, on the way to the MVP award.\n\nSince the All-Star break, Westbrook has averaged a triple-double \u2014 32.9 points, 10.1 rebounds and 11.1 assists \u2014 and taken the league\u2019s scoring lead from Houston\u2019s James Harden. This mind-blowing run followed his 41-point outburst in the All-Star Game that earned him MVP honors.\n\nWestbrook has used his rare athletic ability and sheer will to keep his team in the playoff hunt as it prepares for Durant\u2019s scheduled return in a week or two. He will get a chance to strengthen his MVP resume before a national television audience when the Thunder host the Chicago Bulls on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\u201cWestbrook is playing at a high level,\u201d Milwaukee Bucks coach Jason Kidd said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if people really understand what he\u2019s doing. The way he\u2019s filling up the stat sheet and winning ball games with some key guys out \u2014 what he is doing on a nightly basis is very impressive, and puts him in that MVP category.\u201d\n\nWestbrook was the Western Conference Player of the Month in February. The Thunder went 9-3, despite Durant missing seven of those games.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if anybody\u2019s playing better,\u201d Los Angeles Clippers coach Doc Rivers said of Westbrook. \u201cHe has to be (in the MVP conversation). He\u2019s dominant. He\u2019s carried a team, for the most part, all year. K.D.\u2019s (Kevin Durant) been in and out, which is very difficult for a team to ever get their rhythm during that time period. And yet, they keep winning.\u201d\n\nWestbrook insists his role isn\u2019t much different without Durant \u2014 he does the same things, but more of them. Oklahoma City is battling with New Orleans for the No. 8 spot in the Western Conference standings. Westbrook said his focus remains on leading the team and winning.\n\n\u201cMy mindset\u2019s the same as it\u2019s been since I came into the league,\u201d he said. \u201cPlay hard every night, give it all I have, regardless of what\u2019s going on and how many injuries we have.\u201d\n\nIn the first game after the All-Star break without Durant, Westbrook scored 33 points in a victory at Charlotte. The next game, he had 21 points, a career-high 17 assists and eight rebounds in a win against Denver. He had 10 assists in the second quarter, the most by any player in any quarter in more than a year, and he did it in just 8 minutes and 40 seconds.\n\nHe had triple doubles against Indiana and Phoenix, then had 40 points, 13 rebounds and 11 assists in a loss at Portland on Feb. 27. He broke a bone in his right cheek late in the Portland game when teammate Andre Roberson accidentally kneed him in the face, but he only missed one game after surgery. When he returned, donning a protective mask, he posted 49 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists in a win over the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nIt was the most points in a triple-double since Larry Bird scored 49 in 1992. It also was his fourth straight triple-double, the most since Michael Jordan had seven straight in 1989. The back-to-back 40-point triple-doubles were the first pair since Jordan accomplished the feat in 1989.\n\nAfter the triple-double streak ended in a 43-point game at Chicago, Westbrook scored 30 points, matched a career high with 17 assists and snagged 11 rebounds in a 108-104 win over Toronto. His latest triple-double was a 29-point, 12-assist, 10-rebound effort in a 113-99 win over Minnesota on Friday night.\n\n\u201cIf you find somebody who has slowed him down, let me know,\u201d Raptors guard DeMar DeRozan said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely tough. You got to give him credit. Their best player is out and he\u2019s stepping up when they\u2019re fighting for a playoff spot.\u201d\n\nWell before the All-Star break, Westbrook had been attacking the basket more, shooting fewer 3-pointers and looking for his teammates more often. Westbrook offered a glimpse of what he might be capable of in January, notching a triple-double against Orlando. But before the February scoring outburst, Westbrook\u2019s stellar play was overshadowed by a back-and-forth with a local columnist during a postgame interview, racking up a league-leading technical foul total and missing 14 games with a broken bone in his left hand. As the calendar flipped, Westbrook became less confrontational and let the world focus on his game.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a normal guy, just like anybody else,\u201d Westbrook said. \u201cObviously, I play the game differently from anybody else in the world \u2014 with a lot of emotion. It doesn\u2019t determine who I am as a person \u2014 if you know me, you know the type of guy I am \u2014 caring, unselfish, willing guy. I just want to do the right thing.\u201d\n\nWestbrook often has been criticized for his shot selection and decision making, so when Thunder coach Scott Brooks mentions his point guard\u2019s latest accomplishments, there often is a hint of \u2018I told you so\u2019 in his voice. Before the season began, Brooks boldly proclaimed Westbrook the best point guard in the NBA.\n\n\u201cRussell\u2019s at a high level, but he\u2019s been playing this way for a long time, for a lot of years, and every year, like all the special players do, they come back a little bit better,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nWith Westbrook doing so much, it makes the game simple for his teammates.\n\n\u201cThe way he\u2019s playing right now is incredible,\u201d Thunder forward Serge Ibaka said. \u201cHe\u2019s making everything easy for us. Just be ready and catch the ball.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Russell Westbrook carries Thunder without Kevin Durant", "title": "Russell Westbrook carries Thunder without Kevin Durant", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/14/russell-westbrook-carries-thunder-without-kevin-durant/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150314_010325_russell-westbrook.jpg", "height": 478}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150314_010325_russell-westbrook.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-14T12:50:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T20:08:06+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd1fa\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe way he\u2019s playing right now is incredible,\u201d Thunder forward Serge Ibaka said.\nDurant went on a glorious two-month run, averaging 35 points while Westbrook recovered from knee surgery, on the way to the MVP award.\nOKLAHOMA CITY \u2014 Russell Westbrook is playing the best basketball of his career, and he\u2019s helping new teammate Enes Kanter do the same.\nThe next game, he had 21 points, a career-high 17 assists and eight rebounds in a win against Denver.\nUtah sent Kanter to Oklahoma City at the trade deadline, and Westbrook stepped forward to connect with the young center."}
