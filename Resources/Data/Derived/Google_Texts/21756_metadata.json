None of the new or renovated spaces were affected by Saturday\u2019s water main break, Lovvorn said.\n\nCrews continued to tend to the gaping hole on the 600 block of Ervay Street Saturday afternoon. The area was still closed off to traffic.\n\nOriginal post at 8:50 a.m.: An overnight water man break caused water to gush out of the ground and pour into the First Baptist Dallas building in downtown, causing water levels to rise five feet in the church\u2019s basement, utilities officials said.\n\nThe break, located in the 600 block of Ervay Street, was reported around midnight Saturday. Crews cut off water flow to the pipe by 1 a.m., said Joel Tillery, a senior program manager for Dallas Water Utilities.\n\nBy then, water levels had risen about five feet in the basement.\n\n\u201cThe water was coming up, going over the sidewalk and into the doors,\u201d Tillery said.\n\nHe said he did not know how much water flowed out of the damaged 12-inch water main. The cause of the break was also unknown as of 8 a.m. Saturday.\n\nMore than a dozen workers helped clean up the area.\n\nBuilding recovery crews were at the scene for more than seven hours, pumping water out of the building. Utilities crews focused their efforts on the 10-by-12 feet hole in the street, digging into the roadway to get to the damaged pipe.\n\nErvay Street, between San Jacinto and Patterson streets, was closed to traffic. Tillery said officials planned to temporarily repair and re-open the street by the afternoon.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll clean as much mud and debris as we can,\u201d he said.\n\nChurch officials could not immediately be reached.\n\nMore soon.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE0LzA5L3dhdGVyLW1haW4tYnJlYWstY2F1c2VzLWZsb29kLWluLWJhc2VtZW50LW9mLWRvd250b3duLWNodXJjaC1vZmZpY2lhbHMtc2F5Lmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Naheed Rajwani", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "Updated on Tuesday: A city spokeswoman said the water main break was caused by corrosion in the line.
