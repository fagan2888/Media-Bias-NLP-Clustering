The high court said in the Bowen decision: \u201cNever to our knowledge has the Court interpreted the First Amendment to require the Government itself to behave in ways that the individual believes will further his or her spiritual development or that of his or her family.\u201d\n\nRendell said the district court was \u201cmisguided\u201d in accepting Geneva College\u2019s claim that its self-certification was the \u201ccentral cog\u201d that enabled students and employees to get abortion drugs.\n\nBecause it has \u201cdispelled the notion that the self-certification procedure is burdensome,\u201d the appeals court \u201cneed not consider whether the burden is substantial\u201d on the college, according to the opinion.\n\nRendell also said the judges wouldn\u2019t consider whether self-certification was the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d of providing abortion drugs to women. That\u2019s part of the legal standard known as strict scrutiny, which courts apply when considering infringements on constitutional rights.\n\n\u201cGeneva College simply wants to abide by the Christian faith it espouses and teaches instead of being forced into an unacceptable inconsistency by the government,\u201d Alliance Defending Freedom said after the ruling. \u201cThe administration has no business punishing people of faith for making decisions consistent with that faith.\u201d\n\nGreg Piper is an assistant editor at The College Fix.
