Only one week after Sen. Mitch Mc­Con­nell took the CEO of Delta Air Lines to break­fast in the ex­clus­ive Sen­ate Din­ing Room last month, the air­line ex­ec­ut­ive and his wife wrote $10,000 worth of checks to help fund Mc­Con­nell’s polit­ic­al op­er­a­tion.

The dona­tions, which were re­por­ted to the Fed­er­al Elec­tion Com­mis­sion on Wed­nes­day, made Rick and Susan An­der­son the largest con­trib­ut­ors to Mc­Con­nell’s Bluegrass Com­mit­tee in Ju­ly. Delta Air Lines’ PAC con­trib­uted an­oth­er $2,500 with­in days of the break­fast.

The prox­im­ity between the meal on Cap­it­ol Hill and the date of the dona­tions provides a win­dow in­to how mod­ern Wash­ing­ton works. It’s a place where in­cum­bent law­makers, es­pe­cially those who—like Mc­Con­nell—face a ser­i­ous reelec­tion fight, are re­lent­lessly court­ing con­trib­ut­ors at all hours to fund mul­ti­mil­lion-dol­lar polit­ic­al cam­paigns.

Mc­Con­nell spokes­wo­man Al­lis­on Moore said no money was so­li­cited over break­fast in the Cap­it­ol. “Of course not,” she said. Asked if Mc­Con­nell reg­u­larly takes donors to meals at the form­al Sen­ate Din­ing Room, she said, “No, Richard An­der­son is a friend.”

Still, Sheila Krum­holz, ex­ec­ut­ive dir­ect­or of the Cen­ter for Re­spons­ive Polit­ics, which tracks cam­paign money, noted of the meal, “This is the kind of rare ac­cess that most of us will nev­er ex­per­i­ence.”

“Who makes a good enough break­fast com­pan­ion for a sit­ting sen­at­or in a highly com­pet­it­ive reelec­tion cam­paign to take time out of their busy day?” Krum­holz said. “It nev­er hurts if the per­son can fol­low up with a dona­tion, and all the bet­ter if it can be a siz­able one.”

Typ­ic­ally, a sen­at­or’s guest in the sanc­tu­ary of the Sen­ate Din­ing Room would re­main un­dis­closed. But Mc­Con­nell’s meal with An­der­son was in­cluded in a piece about the de­clin­ing im­port­ance of the din­ing room as a place where bi­par­tis­an deals can be brokered. Here’s the scene painted by Ash­ley Park­er in The New York Times:

One morn­ing last month, Sen­at­or Mitch Mc­Con­nell, Re­pub­lic­an of Ken­tucky, the minor­ity lead­er, was din­ing with Richard H. An­der­son, the chief ex­ec­ut­ive of Delta Air Lines. When the two men stood up, Mr. An­der­son stopped by the table of Mr. Schu­mer, who was there hav­ing break­fast as well. The Fed­er­al Avi­ation Ad­min­is­tra­tion had be­gun a ban, since re­versed, on flights to Is­rael. “Fly to Is­rael!” Mr. Schu­mer urged Mr. An­der­son. From across the room, Mr. Mc­Con­nell jok­ingly warned his guest to steer clear of Mr. Schu­mer: “An­der­son, stay away from him!” he said. But Mr. Schu­mer was un­deterred. Shout­ing now, he gamely pressed his point. “Tell him to fly to Is­rael!” he bel­lowed. Then, every­one con­tin­ued with break­fast.

The FAA began its ban on flights to Is­rael on Ju­ly 22 and res­cin­ded the or­der about 36 hours later. The con­tri­bu­tions from the An­der­sons to Mc­Con­nell are dated Ju­ly 29. The Delta Air Lines PAC dona­tion is dated Ju­ly 28. The dona­tions went to Mc­Con­nell’s lead­er­ship PAC, the Bluegrass Com­mit­tee, which can be used for polit­ic­al op­er­a­tions not re­lated to his reelec­tion cam­paign this fall against Demo­crat­ic chal­lenger Al­is­on Lun­der­gan Grimes.

The money was hardly the first in­vest­ment that Delta and its em­ploy­ees have made in Mc­Con­nell re­cently. Last Septem­ber and Oc­to­ber, 22 em­ploy­ees of Delta and the air­line’s PAC gave $26,500 to the Mc­Con­nell Vic­tory Ken­tucky Com­mit­tee, which splits its pro­ceeds between Mc­Con­nell’s reelec­tion ac­count and the Ken­tucky Re­pub­lic­an Party.

An­der­son him­self has also giv­en $20,000 to the Ken­tucky Re­pub­lic­an Party in the last two years. A spokes­wo­man for Delta Air Lines de­clined to com­ment on An­der­son’s polit­ic­al giv­ing.

As for break­fast, the sen­at­or picked up the tab. “As is cus­tom­ary when sen­at­ors dine in the Sen­ate Din­ing Room,” Moore said.
