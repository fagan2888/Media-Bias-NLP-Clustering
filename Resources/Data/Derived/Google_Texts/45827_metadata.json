Singer was on the program to promote his new book, The Most Good You Can Do: How Effective Altruism Is Changing Ideas About Living Ethically.\n\nHailed by The New Yorker as the planet\u2019s \u201cmost influential living philosopher,\u201d the Australian says his work \u201cis based on the assumption that clarity and consistency in our moral thinking is likely, in the long run, to lead us to hold better views on ethical issues.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nWhen asked by Klein if health care rationing will become more commonplace under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), known as Obamacare, Singer said rationing is already underway.\n\n\u201cIf an infant is born with a massive hemorrhage in the brain that means it will be so severely disabled that if the infant lives it will never even be able to recognize its mother, it won\u2019t be able to interact with any other human being, it will just lie there in the bed and you could feed it but that\u2019s all that will happen, doctors will turn off the respirator that is keeping that infant alive,\u201d Singer said.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether they are influenced by reducing costs. Probably they are just influenced by the fact that this will be a terrible burden for the parents to look after, and there will be no quality of life for the child. So we are already taking steps that quite knowingly and intentionally are ending the lives of severely disabled infants.

And if we didn\u2019t do them we would be able to do a lot more good for other people who have better prospects,\u2019 then yes,\u201d answered Singer.\n\nI think it would be reasonable for governments to say, \u2018This treatment is not going to be provided on the national health service if it\u2019s a country with a national health service. Or in the United States on Medicare or Medicaid.\u2019 Advertisement \u2013 story continues below Trending Stories Glenn Beck Warns About What Comes Next on The Slippery Slope\n\nCampaign Manager Makes Announcement About Donald Trump\u2019s Running Mate\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas Faces Internet Anger Over Dissenting Vote And I think it will be reasonable for insurance companies also to say, \u2018You know, we won\u2019t insure you for this or we won\u2019t insure you for this unless you are prepared to pay an extra premium, or perhaps they have a fund with lower premiums for people who don\u2019t want to insure against that.\u2019\n\n\u201cBecause I think most people, when they think about that, would say that\u2019s quite reasonable. You know, I don\u2019t want my health insurance premiums to be higher so that infants who can experience zero quality of life can have expensive treatments,\u201d Singer concluded.\n\nh/t: WND\n\nDo you think we will see care rationed for babies soon?
