A week after announcing efforts to stem the illegal animal trade, he called the collection \u201coverwhelming.\u201d\n\nFroman, the nation\u2019s top trade negotiator and an adviser to President Barack Obama, was walking through a warehouse at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge, where about 1.5 million such items are stored.\n\nThe repository, the only one in the U.S., has seen an uptick in recent years, said Doni Sprague, wildlife repository specialist at the Fish and Wildlife Service. Roughly 36,000 items \u2014 most seized at U.S. border crossings \u2014 were added last year.\n\nThe visit, Froman said, underscored the need to slow the trade, which the Obama administration said in February it would try to do.\n\nThe administration said the animal trail has been used in recent years to fund terrorist groups like al-Shabab, al Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Somalia, and the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army, believed to be in central Africa.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s huge amounts of money in the wildlife trade,\u201d said Steve Oberholtzer, special agent in charge of the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s Mountain-Prairie region.\n\nThe U.S. plans to use its negotiations with other countries \u2014 particularly in Asia and Europe \u2014 to try to slow the trade, which is worth billions of dollars, Froman announced last week. The administration has also said it will ramp up enforcement and work to reduce demand.\n\nThat effort begins with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement being negotiated with 11 other countries, mostly in the Asia-Pacific, Froman said. A half dozen more countries are interested in joining, he said.\n\n\u201cPart of the goal of (the partnership) is to raise the standards of environmental protection generally \u2014 that this becomes a new global standard, that through trade agreements, we ought to be dealing with issues like this,\u201d Froman said.\n\nThe U.S. expects to work toward a similar deal, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, with European countries over the next year.\n\nIf successful, the two agreements would cover two-thirds of the global economy.\n\nStill, they wouldn\u2019t cover China, where the illegal animal trade has boomed as that country\u2019s middle class as grown. The U.S. and China aren\u2019t currently negotiating, a spokesman for the trade representative said.\n\nHow much of the illegal animal trade is seized by law enforcement isn\u2019t clear, Oberholtzer said, but it\u2019s \u201cnowhere near\u201d the total that flows throughout the world.\n\nElephant poaching peaked in 2011, when more than 25,000 were killed, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Last year, more than 20,000 were killed.\n\nAnd demand for rhinos is soaring, Oberholtzer said. More than 1,000 were killed last year in South Africa, which has the world\u2019s largest rhino population; that\u2019s an increase of 50 percent.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to need more warehouse space,\u201d Froman said.\n\n\u201cNot if you\u2019re successful, ambassador,\u201d an aide quipped back.\n\nThad Moore: tsmoore@denverpost.com, 303-954-1902, or twitter.com/thadmoore", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Wildlife repository illustrates trouble U.S. trade agenda aims to stop", "title": "Wildlife repository illustrates trouble U.S. trade agenda aims to stop", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/23/wildlife-repository-illustrates-trouble-u-s-trade-agenda-aims-to-stop/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140623__20140624_A7_BZ24TRADEp2.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140623__20140624_A7_BZ24TRADEp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-23T12:50:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T06:33:42+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd08b1\"", "article_summary": "Still, they wouldn\u2019t cover China, where the illegal animal trade has boomed as that country\u2019s middle class as grown.\n\u201cThere\u2019s huge amounts of money in the wildlife trade,\u201d said Steve Oberholtzer, special agent in charge of the Fish and Wildlife Service\u2019s Mountain-Prairie region.\nHow much of the illegal animal trade is seized by law enforcement isn\u2019t clear, Oberholtzer said, but it\u2019s \u201cnowhere near\u201d the total that flows throughout the world.\nThe repository, the only one in the U.S., has seen an uptick in recent years, said Doni Sprague, wildlife repository specialist at the Fish and Wildlife Service.\nCOMMERCE CITY \u2014 U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman walked past taxidermied tigers, shelves stacked with leopard heads and dismembered elephants\u2019 feet."}
