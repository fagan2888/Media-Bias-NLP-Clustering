Tony Shin reports for NBC4 News at 5 p.m. from Victorville Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2014. (Published Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2014)\n\nParker, 36, died after he was shocked by a Taser multiple times in August by a sheriff's deputy while a colleague was trying to arrest him for an alleged burglary.\n\nIn his videotaped reply, Ramos said Stewart was \"so wrong\" about how Parker died, saying the father of five was under the influence of drugs when he was allegedly resisting his arrest.\n\nThe coroner's report said he died from a combination of PCP intoxication and heart disease, though the family planned to sue the sheriff's department for wrongful death.\n\n\"I really believe we need to get our facts straight before we start making statements like that,\" Ramos said Wednesday, going on to urge viewers to talk about how law enforcement officers risk their lives.\n\nStewart evidently agreed that he committed an error.\n\n\"You're right re Dante Parker. Sloppy to put him in our list of shootings,\" the Daily show account tweeted on Friday, mentioning Ramos's work account. \"Larger point still stands.\"\n\nAn apology on TV will come on Monday, according to the Daily Show's tweet.", "article_metadata": {"description": "&quot;Daily Show&quot; host Jon Stewart apologized to a San Bernardino district attorney Friday for lumping a local death in with police shootings.", "title": "Jon Stewart: &quot;Sloppy&quot; to Include San Bernardino Taser Death in Michael Brown Segment", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Southern California", "description": "\"Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart apologized to a San Bernardino district attorney Friday for lumping a local death in with police shootings.", "title": "Jon Stewart Apologizes to San Bernardino DA", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Jon-Stewart-Sloppy-to-Include-San-Bernardino-Taser-Death-in-Michael-Brown-Segment-284975781.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/JonStewart4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart apologized to a San Bernardino district attorney Friday for lumping a local death in with police shootings.", "title": "Jon Stewart Apologizes to San Bernardino DA", "url": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Jon-Stewart-Sloppy-to-Include-San-Bernardino-Taser-Death-in-Michael-Brown-Segment-284975781.html", "image": "http://media.nbclosangeles.com/images/1200*675/JonStewart4.jpg?ak=bc", "creator": "@nbcla", "site": "@nbcla", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Flash,HTML5", "FlashBlacklist": "None|None", "preferredFormats": "mpeg4,m3u,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361}, "keywords": "Jon Stewart, Dante Parker, Micheal Ramos", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Jon Stewart, Dante Parker, Micheal Ramos"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb24\"", "article_summary": "\"Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart apologized to a San Bernardino district attorney Friday for lumping a local police Taser-related death in with police shootings of black men.\nBut San Bernardino County DA Michael Ramos was outraged when a man from his jurisdiction was included in that list.\nSloppy to put him in our list of shootings,\" the Daily show account tweeted on Friday, mentioning Ramos's work account.\n\"The Daily Show\" host Jon Stewart apologized Friday, Dec. 5, for including a California man who died after a sheriff's deputy Tasered him in a list of police shooting victims.\nIn his videotaped reply, Ramos said Stewart was \"so wrong\" about how Parker died, saying the father of five was under the influence of drugs when he was allegedly resisting his arrest."}
