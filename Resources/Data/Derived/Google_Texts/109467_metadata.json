He described how he\u2019d come up with the idea to have the patients meet with a speech pathologist prior to surgery to record messages in their own voices. When the patients would wake up in the intensive care unit, they\u2019d have technology at their bedside that allowed them to press a button and play these prerecorded messages. This idea, called \u201cmessage banking,\u201d was innovative at the time.\n\nAnd it was powerful: Parents and children said it helped them maintain a connection through the time when their children could not speak.\n\nAfter Costello finished the session at the conference, a Massachusetts General Hospital speech pathologist focused on Lou Gehrig's disease approached him and asked if he would be willing to see some of the hospital's patients. Despite the fact that the pediatric facility was busy, and with a long waiting list, he agreed to see the additional ALS patients, and the results have been tremendous.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working with patients who need augmentative communication since 1985,\u201d says Howard Shane, director of the Center for Communication Enhancement at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cBut John has really moved it up a notch. He\u2019s so dedicated to what he\u2019s doing, and he\u2019s a great clinician.\u201d\n\nOnce they began, it became \u201cabundantly evident\u201d to Costello that \u201cthere is so much that needs to be done\u201d for patients with ALS, who are faced with the real possibility of losing speech permanently. \u201cWe thought, if we could meet people early enough in the disease process, they could bank messages in their actual voices,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cFor people who have ALS, things are being taken away from them at every turn,\u201d says Costello. \u201cThey\u2019re losing motor control, the ability to eat, the ability to dress oneself, the ability to walk, to talk, and eventually to breathe independently. We\u2019ve tried to focus, in the face of this horrible disease, on how we can support people to preserve self, to be in control.\u201d\n\nTo do this, he provides them with portable recorders they can take home to record messages in realtime as they think of them. \u201cWhen people have to sit in front of the computer with a mic in front of them and think of all the things they want to say \u2014 that\u2019s hard,\u201d he explains. \u201cI think the way to record really meaningful messages is to do it through a dynamic process, in real time, throughout the day.\u201d\n\nGiving patients a legacy\n\nOften, the most important messages that patients bank are the most personal \u2014 the ones that \u201care a real reflection of your authentic self,\u201d he says. Costello calls these \u201clegacy\u201d messages. \u201cWhen you say them now, people associate them with you,\u201d says Costello. For example, one of Costello\u2019s patients recorded himself saying, \u201cA-ha!\u201d His daughters laughed and one said, \u201cThat\u2019s just perfect, Dad,\u201d and explained to Costello that in that one word, with a specific intonation, her father had conveyed, \u201cI hear what you\u2019re saying and I completely disagree, but I\u2019m not going to interfere.\u201d\n\nCostello is part of a team at Boston Children\u2019s that includes speech-language pathologists and occupational therapists with special expertise in using assistive technology. They work hard to help patients develop a communication system that will serve their needs in the present as well as in the future \u2014 with message banking as an important part of this.\n\nBut the team\u2019s ability to serve adults with ALS has been limited by logistics; there are only so many hours in the day, and the program treats pediatric patients as well. Plus, once a patient\u2019s disease progresses, they can no longer come to the clinic, requiring home visits on evenings and weekends. The clinicians cared for the most critical patients, using their personal time to do it, but haven\u2019t been able to make the program available to everyone who needs it.\n\nA prominent patient gives back\n\nOne of the program\u2019s patients, Jay Fishman, former CEO and current chairman of financial company Travelers, was so moved by the dedication and passion of Costello and his team that he and his wife Randy made a $1.5 million gift to help Boston Children\u2019s Hospital establish a formal augmentative communication program for adults with ALS. Travelers employees, board members and other corporate and nonprofit donors also donated a total of nearly $4 million. Boston Children\u2019s aims to raise $10 million overall to establish a permanent endowment for the program, which Costello will direct.\n\nThe program has already hired two additional staff members dedicated exclusively to providing services to people with ALS. \u201cWe are now able to look at broadening the number of people we see, and hopefully continuing to provide the tools and strategies that people need throughout this disease process,\u201d says Costello. The team hopes not only to greatly expand the number of patients in the program, but also to train other ALS clinics on how to provide these services to their patients.\n\nCostello praises Boston Children\u2019s for its flexibility and support in embracing the program\u2019s aims from its earliest days. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to create a program that isn\u2019t just me, and it isn\u2019t just message banking,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the really big picture of looking at physical access, control, communication throughout the course of the disease, and working with families. I\u2019m deeply grateful to my colleagues who were able to step up and figure out how to be innovative, and to the hospital\u2019s leadership in facilitating that to happen.\u201d\n\nShane says the feedback from patients and families has been profound. \u201cIt\u2019s so important because it preserves something that\u2019s such a critical part of who they are,\u201d he says. \u201cJohn is very caring. He\u2019s gotten very deeply involved with the families and really understands their needs and gives them an incredible amount of support. Nobody is more devoted to their patients than he.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Speech pathologist John Costello was leading a session at a conference back in 2009 about the work he was doing at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital with pediatric patients who were temporarily unable to speak after a surgical procedure.
