Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Friday delivered a blistering speech in Texas in which he said the Obama administration has failed to defend the Constitution, failed to stand up for human rights around the globe, and failed to create jobs and economic prosperity at home.\n\nCruz spoke at the Texas Republican Party convention in Forth Worth, delivering a speech that many will likely see as a warm-up for a presidential run, as he essentially accused President Barack Obama of failing to meet his essential duties as president.\n\nHe began by rattling off the ways Democrats are trying to chip away at the Bill of Rights. Earlier in the week, Cruz accused Democrats of abandoning the Bill of Rights by looking to change the First Amendment to regulate political speech.\n\nCruz carried that message back to his home state, and said the Constitution, which was designed to \u201cbind the mischief of government,\u201d needs to be vigorously defended.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of mischief in Washington right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to defend the Bill of Rights, all of the Bill of Rights.\u201d\n\nHe said the First Amendment needs to be defended against the IRS, which has been asking questions about how groups pray and what they read when assessing their tax-exempt status.\n\n\u201cThe IRS is demanding of citizen groups, tell us what books you\u2019re reading. Tell us the content of your prayers,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know what? The federal government has no business asking any American the content of our prayers.\u201d\n\nCruz said the Second, Fourth and Fifth Amendments are also under attack, and zinged the National Security Agency\u2019s controversial phone data collection program as a chief example.\n\n\u201cLeave your cell phones on,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure President Obama hears every word we say.\u201d\n\nCruz said President Barack Obama has been notably absent in the effort to fight for human rights. And he said the lack of U.S. leadership in foreign affairs has left the world without a strong leader, and has allowed Iran, Russia and China to fill that leadership vacuum.\n\n\u201cWhen bullies and tyrants are laughing at America, that\u2019s not the American tradition, that\u2019s not the American spirit, that is not who we are,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said Obama has essentially abandoned people like Pastor Saeed Abedini, an American pastor imprisoned in Iran, and Meriam Ibrahim, the Sudanese woman sentenced to death for marrying a Christian.\n\n\u201cWhere is the President of the United States?\u201d Cruz asked. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t the President of the United States standing up on the world stage and saying, \u2018free Meriam Ibrahim right now?\u2019 \u201d\n\nFinally, Cruz said Obama has promoted a larger, more intrusive government that has stifled growth. Like other Republicans, he blamed Washington regulation for preventing more dynamic growth that has been seen in past recoveries.\n\n\u201cWe unleash the American energy renaissance that\u2019s creating millions of high-paying jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe audit the federal reserve, we abolish the IRS, and we repeal every blessed word of Obamacare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Sen.
