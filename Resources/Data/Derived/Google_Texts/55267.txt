A Saturday afternoon rock rock slide hit a power line and knocked out electricity to the Telluride area, the San Miguel Sheriffâ€™s Office said.

Deputy Travis Hardy said the Tri-State Generation and Transmission power lines are still energized, but the slide has broken connections and the electricity is not reaching its destination.

Tri-State has crews en route to repair the lines, but it could take up to 8 hours to restore power.

The outage, which began around 2:45 p.m., affects Telluride, Telluride Ski Resort, Mountain Village, Ilium Valley and the Down Valley area, which includes Sawpit and Placerville, Hardy said.

Because the area is also served by backup diesel generators, ski lifts continue to run and no one is stranded, Hardy said.

The outage and potentially drawn-out repair processs affects no more than 3,000 people, he said.
