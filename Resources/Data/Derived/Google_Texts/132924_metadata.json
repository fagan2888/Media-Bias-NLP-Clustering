The moms start off sharing details about those celebrities\u2019 childhoods, and end up pointing out that young people shouldn\u2019t skip out on health care because their moms would worry about them too much. \u201cWe nag you because we love you!\u201d Michelle Obama says before directing viewers to HealthCare.gov.\n\n\u201cNagging moms\u201d are clearly a theme in the awareness campaign around health care. Last December, President Obama hosted a group of moms at the White House to emphasize the \u201cunique role\u201d they play in their kids\u2019 decision to enroll in health insurance. \u201cBlame Obama for Latest Round of Mom\u2019s Nagging,\u201d New York Magazine joked at the time.\n\nBut the concerns of parents have been part of the Obama brand since long before this final health care push. From racial issues to poverty to reproductive rights, the administration regularly uses the language of parenting as a tool to argue for policy. That strategy has been a defining one for Obama\u2019s presidency, with both upsides and downsides: It puts a personal touch on his legislative positions, but can come across as a bit too patronizing. And, like practically everything related to our first black president\u2019s time in the White House, it\u2019s also a dynamic that\u2019s not without racial implications.\n\nBarack and Michelle Obama are parents to two adolescent girls, and they admit openly that their roles as a father and a mother shape much of the way they talk about their legislative priorities. In a society that typically doesn\u2019t require male public figures to emphasize their relationship with their kids, it can be refreshing to observe the president in this context. \u201cI see President Obama as uniquely forthright in how central fatherhood and his identity as a father are to his role as president,\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Melissa Harris-Perry pointed out in an interview with ThinkProgress last week. \u201cAlthough all our presidents have been fathers, I\u2019m not sure we have had another president in the modern era for whom this identity is so obviously central.\u201d\n\nThis takes shape most clearly when Obama speaks about racial politics and his identity as an African-American dad (an area that, thanks to the persistent stereotype of the \u201cabsent black father,\u201d is especially pressure-filled for Obama). When Trayvon Martin was shot and killed because George Zimmerman found his hoodie threatening, Obama famously said that if he had a son, he would look like Trayvon; that acknowledgment made the political into something intensely personal, and led to some of Obama\u2019s most pointed comments about racial inequity during his entire time in office. That parental instinct is also behind the president\u2019s \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper\u201d initiative, a program seeking to improve young black men\u2019s economic opportunities that Obama says was inspired by Trayvon. The new policy push is described explicitly in terms of familial bonds, with Obama positioned at the head of the household. When writing about the program, Salon\u2019s Dr. Brittney Cooper described him as \u201cdonning the role of father-in-chief\u201d for black people while introducing My Brother\u2019s Keeper.\n\nBut there are potential pitfalls in playing the role of America\u2019s dad, too. Obama has drawn some criticism for over-emphasizing black men\u2019s responsibility to step up. \u201cLike many African-American men, the president has bought into the narrative about the problems of absentee black fathers and about the potential danger and destructiveness of fatherless black sons,\u201d Cooper notes in Salon. Cooper wrote about these concerns earlier for Ebony last year, lamenting Obama\u2019s decision to blame \u201cbroken black families\u201d for much the much larger structural issues of poverty and violence. And even though Cooper is quoted here, she\u2019s hardly the only person to make this point.\n\nThe racial element of this parental approach certainly draws ire, but so do other issue areas. The president was sharply rebuked last year for taking an overly paternal approach to emergency contraception, defending unnecessary restrictions on over-the-counter Plan B \u201cas a father of two daughters,\u201d even though that flew in the face of the scientific evidence confirming this type of birth control is safe for girls of all ages. \u201cStop patronizing me,\u201d one teenager wrote in RH Reality Check in response to Obama\u2019s stance.\n\nThe First Lady, too, is not immune to criticism about her role as a political mom. Mrs. Obama often talks about her nutrition initiatives in terms of wanting to keep her family healthy and recently went on the Tonight Show to discuss parenting teenage daughters. She made relateable jokes about what it\u2019s going to be like to teach Malia to drive and how her kids think she\u2019s uncool. But unlike men embracing fatherhood, women talking about their kids fit neatly into society\u2019s gender expectations. So Michelle has been derided by some for embracing a \u201cmom-in-chief\u201d label, and last fall, Politico Magazine argued that her focus on issues traditionally tied to domesticity makes her a \u201cfeminist nightmare.\u201d Here, too, it\u2019s ultimately impossible to separate race from the conversation. Women of color have pushed back on the idea that the First Lady is somehow anti-feminist, pointing out that being a black \u201cmom-in-chief\u201d is a revolutionary act in a society in which African-American women rarely have the privilege to focus on motherhood instead of a career.\n\nThe approach of acting the parent isn\u2019t a perfect strategy, especially when it comes to women\u2019s issues. But both Obama and his wife have been able to largely come across as genuine, and that\u2019s thanks to their ability to undermine assumptions about them and their race. For politicians who are always expected to be \u201ctwice as good\u201d \u2014 and, in some ways, have embraced this framing for the black community \u2014 it\u2019s perhaps not a surprise that they\u2019ve chosen to double down on this aspect of family values.\n\nWhen it comes to Obamacare, gently reminding kids about why it\u2019s important to eat your vegetables can be easier than delving into the policy of health reform. Will this rhetoric actually work on young people? Only time will tell. The number of young enrollees is inching up. But Americans might end up tuning out the president\u2019s nagging \u2014 just like they tune out their own parents.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The concerns of parents have been part of the Obama brand since long before this final health care push.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The concerns of parents have been part of the Obama brand since long before this final health care push.", "title": "Barack And Michelle Are All Of Our Parents Now", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/culture/2014/03/17/3408981/obama-paternal-politics/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obamas.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The concerns of parents have been part of the Obama brand since long before this final health care push.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obamas-321x214.jpg", "title": "Barack And Michelle Are All Of Our Parents Now", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-culture", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obamas.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obamas.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-03-17T11:28:13+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "That parental instinct is also behind the president\u2019s \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper\u201d initiative, a program seeking to improve young black men\u2019s economic opportunities that Obama says was inspired by Trayvon.\nBut the concerns of parents have been part of the Obama brand since long before this final health care push.\nLast December, President Obama hosted a group of moms at the White House to emphasize the \u201cunique role\u201d they play in their kids\u2019 decision to enroll in health insurance.\n\u201cBlame Obama for Latest Round of Mom\u2019s Nagging,\u201d New York Magazine joked at the time.\nFrom racial issues to poverty to reproductive rights, the administration regularly uses the language of parenting as a tool to argue for policy."}
