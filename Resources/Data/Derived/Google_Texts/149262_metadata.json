The championship was Pinewood Prep\u2019s second straight and fourth since 2009 and capped a 17-4 season for the Panthers.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t even describe what this feels like,\u201d said Ring. \u201cWe wanted this so bad and we worked so hard for this. I wanted to leave this year with another championship and I just tried to do whatever I could to help us win today.\u201d\n\nRing\u2019s second goal of the game came just 25 seconds after Cardinal-Newman, the state\u2019s top-ranked team, tied the score on Chloe Cobb\u2019s header in the 55th minute of play.\n\nBefore the Cardinals could finish celebrating, the Panthers pushed the ball downfield with Ring taking a pass from Rachel Trout and finding the net on a clear shot from 15 yards out.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t get down, we just push back and try to get control after someone scores,\u201d said Ring.\n\nAfter a scoreless first half where both teams had chances but failed to score, the Panthers broke the scoring ice seven minutes into the second half. Ring gathered a ball deep near the corner and unleashed a rocket towards the goal. The ball carried deep into the box, bent in towards the goal, hit the crossbar and bounced pass the keeper.\n\nPinewood Prep coach Gail Osborne called it a shot but Ring admitted she was simply trying to get the ball inside the box.\n\n\u201cI was pretty far out but I knew I could cross it in front of the goal and maybe make something happen,\u201d says Ring. \u201cI was able to find the net.\u201d\n\n\u201cCharlotte is so strong, she takes those types of shots,\u201d said Osborne. \u201cShe\u2019s a special player and she plays so well in these big games.\u201d\n\nThings got a little hectic late in the game as Pinewood Prep picked up two yellow cards and had to scramble defensively as Cardinal Newman pressed to score. A free kick just before the final whistle was gathered in by keeper Hannah Miner to seal the victory.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a well-played game by two evenly matched teams,\u201d said Osborne. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of our team. Cardinal Newman is a great team. They never stopped fighting and we were able to hold them off. It got a little nervous at the end, but we won. I\u2019m really happy for our team. They worked hard for this and they played amazing today.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Pinewood Prep girls soccer repeats as state champion, Sports, \r\nSportsHigh School, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Pinewood Prep girls soccer", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "Pinewood Prep senior Charlotte Ring finished her season with 46 goals \u2014 no two more important than the last two.", "title": "Pinewood Prep girls soccer repeats as state champion", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150509/150509346/pinewood-prep-girls-soccer-repeats-as-state-champion", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150509/PC20/150509346/AR/0/AR-150509346.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150509/PC20/150509346/AR/0/AR-150509346.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pinewood Prep senior Charlotte Ring finished her season with 46 goals \u2014 no two more important than the last two.", "title": "Pinewood Prep girls soccer repeats as state champion", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150509/PC20/150509346/AR/0/AR-150509346.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150509346}}, "keywords": "Pinewood Prep girls soccer repeats as state champion , Sports, \r\nSportsHigh School, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews, Pinewood Prep girls soccer", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-09T19:17:21Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-09T19:17:00Z"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Pinewood Prep senior Charlotte Ring finished her season with 46 goals \u2014 no two more important than the last two."}, "article_summary": "Ring scored two goals in Saturday\u2019s SCISA AAA state championship game, leading Pinewood Prep to a 2-1 win over Cardinal Newman.\nPinewood Prep senior Charlotte Ring finished her season with 46 goals \u2014 no two more important than the last two.\nPinewood Prep coach Gail Osborne called it a shot but Ring admitted she was simply trying to get the ball inside the box.\nThe championship was Pinewood Prep\u2019s second straight and fourth since 2009 and capped a 17-4 season for the Panthers.\nThe ball carried deep into the box, bent in towards the goal, hit the crossbar and bounced pass the keeper."}
