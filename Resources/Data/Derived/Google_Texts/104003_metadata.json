First, a long-time social taboo becomes much more mainstream. The President spends years opposing its normalization, then as states start acting on their own, he tries to jump out ahead of it by slowly embracing the shift in public opinion. That worked for Barack Obama on same-sex marriage, and it\u2019s beginning to look like the same strategy is in play for marijuana legalization:\n\nVisit NBCNews.com for breaking news, world news, and news about the economy\n\nPresident Barack Obama says smoking pot isn\u2019t \u201cmore dangerous\u201d than drinking alcohol. \u201cAs has been well-documented, I smoked pot as a kid, and I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life,\u201d Obama said in a lengthy profile in the current issue of the New Yorker magazine. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is more dangerous than alcohol.\u201d Pressed by author David Remnick on the comparison, Obama said he thinks marijuana is less dangerous \u201cin terms of its impact on the individual consumer.\u201d But he added, \u201cit\u2019s not something I encourage, and I\u2019ve told my daughters I think it\u2019s a bad idea, a waste of time, not very healthy.\u201d Obama also told Remnick that he is troubled that \u201cmiddle-class kids don\u2019t get locked up for smoking pot, and poor kids do. And African-American kids and Latino kids are more likely to be poor and less likely to have the resources and the support to avoid unduly harsh penalties.\u201d\n\nThat tends to be true, and also fits nicely within his narrative for 2014: inequality. There are other good reasons to support legalization, among them the increasingly ridiculous resources spent fighting an intoxicant not too different from the legal variety, the corrosive effect that has on civil rights, and the money spent on fighting this arm of the War on Drugs.\n\nNick Gillespie believes that Obama has one last chance to establish his legacy as the Commander in Choom Chief through marijuana legalization:\n\nBut there\u2019s one thing left Obama could do to finally become the change he wanted to be: declare a swift and honorable peace in the decades-long war on pot. The drug war in toto has been a long-running and ineffective disaster that disrespects individual autonomy, corrupts law enforcement, and undermines the rule of law. By ending the war on pot, he would be remembered as a true visionary. \u2026 If Obama announced that he was de-prioritizing the federal government\u2019s war on pot\u2014not even on all drugs, but just marijuana\u2014he would almost certainly be joined by a growing number of libertarian Republicans who think drug policy is a state-level issue. Indeed, if Obama framed the issue explicitly in federalist terms, he could likely count on the support of characters such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan. As important, he wouldn\u2019t need congressional buy-in to get this party started. It\u2019s fully within the president\u2019s power\u2014power that he has happily exceeded when it comes to waging wars overseas and delaying aspects of Obamacare\u2014to start the process to reclassify pot from a Schedule I drug to something more credible (a Schedule I drug is deemed to have a high potential for abuse, no known or accepted use as medicine, and no reliable safe dose). That alone would kickstart a long overdue national conversation about the costs and benefits of prohibition. If Obama really thinks pot is no more dangerous than alcohol and that the war on pot systematically screws over minorities, why should he have any hesitation in liberalizing the federal policies over which he has control? And using the bully pulpit to push for broader legislative change at the federal and state level? What is he waiting for, a third term?\n\nThe quick answer to Nick\u2019s central question is that it appears now that Obama doesn\u2019t have any hesitation. He\u2019s just going to roll it out slowly, if he can avoid getting caught by surprise by his own Vice President, as he tried to do with his \u201cevolving\u201d on same-sex marriage. That way he can appear to be leading while he\u2019s following public opinion, and minimize the political risk of getting out in front too far and too fast. It\u2019s a smart strategy, even if it seems a bit telegraphed by now.\n\nOn the other hand, resistance to the rollout of legalized marijuana still exists, and it exists across the political spectrum. In response to Obama\u2019s casual observation that pot isn\u2019t any more dangerous than alcohol, former Congressman Patrick Kennedy \u2014 a fellow progressive \u2014 rises to rebut. Kennedy asserted on last night\u2019s Hardball that marijuana today is not the same choom as in the 1970s:\n\n\u201cI think the president needs to speak to his NIH director in charge of drug abuse,\u201d Kennedy said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball\u201d on Monday night. \u201c[She] would tell the president that, in fact, today\u2019s modern, genetically modified marijuana, so it\u2019s much higher THC levels, far surpass the marijuana that the president acknowledges smoking when he was a young person.\u201d Kennedy said government research shows that marijuana is harmful. \u201cHe is wrong when he says that it isn\u2019t very harmful, because the new marijuana is not the old marijuana,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe need to have presidential decisions made based upon public health and the sound science that the federal government\u2019s invested in.\u201d The former congressman said if the president believes alcohol is more dangerous, he should be concerned about legalizing and commercializing marijuana, because, Kennedy argues, America doesn\u2019t want another Big Tobacco or Big Alcohol. \u201cI mean, if the president feels alcohol is worse than tobacco, what\u2019s he prepared to do? And I\u2019ll tell you, the president won\u2019t be able to do a thing,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWhy? Because alcohol is too powerful an industry to change. And right now, we have a chance to stop another for-profit industry from targeting our public health.\u201d\n\nUSA Today also reported last night that the jury\u2019s out on the relative safety between the two:\n\nThe president is obviously \u201cnot familiar with the science and frankly doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d said Stuart Gitlow. He directs the Annenberg Physician Training Program in Addictive Disease at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. \u201cThere\u2019s no benefit to marijuana,\u201d said Gitlow. \u201cIt\u2019s simply that people want the freedom to be stoned. That\u2019s all it is. And there\u2019s a great deal of risk.\u201d The two drugs have very different side effects, different long-term effects and different contributions to illness and death in the general population. \u201cI would never try to compare and contrast them on something as absurd as \u2018dangerousness,\u2019 \u201d he said. Many physicians disagree. \u201cThat\u2019s a good start from the president but it\u2019s still misinformed,\u201d said Donald Abrams, chief of oncology at San Francisco General Hospital. \u201cIn my 37 years as a physician, the number of patients I\u2019ve admitted to the hospital with complications from marijuana use is zero. The number I\u2019ve admitted due to alcohol use is profound,\u201d he said.\n\nHere\u2019s a question: why not wait to see what happens in Colorado? Give it a few years, and see what impact legalized marijuana has on use, health, safety, and public resources. That would mean Obama won\u2019t get a chance to make federal marijuana legalization his legacy, but ObamaCare will be that no matter what happens with pot anyway.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "The next same-sex marriage?", "title": "Will marijuana legalization be Obama\u2019s legacy?", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/01/21/will-marijuana-legalization-be-obamas-legacy/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/cVCAL9XRzzE/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/cVCAL9XRzzE/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "Barack Obama, Colorado, legacy, legalization, marijuana, Patrick Kennedy,", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-21T15:41:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-21T15:46:12+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcedda\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHe is wrong when he says that it isn\u2019t very harmful, because the new marijuana is not the old marijuana,\u201d Kennedy said.\nThat would mean Obama won\u2019t get a chance to make federal marijuana legalization his legacy, but ObamaCare will be that no matter what happens with pot anyway.\nWill marijuana legalization be Obama\u2019s legacy?\nGive it a few years, and see what impact legalized marijuana has on use, health, safety, and public resources.\nIn response to Obama\u2019s casual observation that pot isn\u2019t any more dangerous than alcohol, former Congressman Patrick Kennedy \u2014 a fellow progressive \u2014 rises to rebut."}
