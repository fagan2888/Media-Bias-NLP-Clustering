Although the extra pollution is impossible to quantify so soon, experts agree that although the amount is globally insignificant, it might add to Europe\u2019s regional health concerns.\n\nOn September 18 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency discovered that four Volkswagen vehicles from model years 2009 to 2015 had been rigged with illegal software. They used a sophisticated algorithm that would make the cars run cleanly during emissions tests but then stop so the cars would get better fuel economy and driving ability. As such, the unrestricted vehicles released higher-than-acceptable emissions in everyday driving situations. The German automaker quickly recalled 482,000 VW and Audi brand cars in the U.S. alone, and later admitted that the software might have been fitted to 11 million vehicles worldwide.\n\nEPA now suspects that these cars emitted 10 to 40 times more nitrogen oxide\u2014a pollutant that can harm human health\u2014than standards allow. Many news organizations were quick to jump on this number. The Guardian ran its own analysis, claiming that the scandal may have caused nearly one million extra metric tons of pollution yearly. But experts remain skeptical.\n\nJohn Heywood, a mechanical engineer at Massachusetts Institute of Technology who focuses on internal combustion engines and air pollution is hesitant to agree with such high numbers. He has identified a key change in how the engine operates (by delaying the start of combustion) that would improve the snappiness of the driving, but it would only increase nitrogen oxide emissions by three to five times.\n\nTravis Bradford, director of Energy and Environment Concentration at Columbia University, agrees. He argues that a number as high as 40 likely represents a spike while the car is accelerating. It cannot be anywhere near the average. \u201cFuels these days are not that dirty and emissions control systems are not that clean,\u201d Bradford says. \u201cSo the idea that it would on average be 40 times the amount of emissions is pretty incredulous.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Experts believe the extra pollution is insignificant globally but could add to Europe's regional health concerns", "title": "The irreversible damage of Volkswagen\u2019s stunning deceit", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Experts believe the extra pollution is insignificant globally but could add to Europe's regional health concerns", "title": "The irreversible damage of Volkswagen\u2019s stunning deceit", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/03/the_vw_scandal_caused_irreversible_environmental_damage_but_likely_not_as_much_as_weve_been_told_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/shutterstock_319834493.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Experts believe the extra pollution is insignificant globally but could add to Europe's regional health concerns", "title": "The irreversible damage of Volkswagen\u2019s stunning deceit", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/shutterstock_319834493.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Shannon Hall", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Environment, EPA, Scientific American, Volkswagen", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb20d\"", "article_summary": "On September 18 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency discovered that four Volkswagen vehicles from model years 2009 to 2015 had been rigged with illegal software.\n\u201cSo the idea that it would on average be 40 times the amount of emissions is pretty incredulous.\u201d\nEPA now suspects that these cars emitted 10 to 40 times more nitrogen oxide\u2014a pollutant that can harm human health\u2014than standards allow.\nAs such, the unrestricted vehicles released higher-than-acceptable emissions in everyday driving situations.\n\u201cFuels these days are not that dirty and emissions control systems are not that clean,\u201d Bradford says."}
