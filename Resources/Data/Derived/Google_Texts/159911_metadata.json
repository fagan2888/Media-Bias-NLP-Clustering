She wants it to have skulls and crossbones, and she wants it to be purple, with her hair to match. Then she wants to wheelchair race her father.\n\nShe\u2019s \u201cexcited\u201d about this new phase in her life. It\u2019s a rebirth.\n\nShe will pose for photos from her hospital bed with a big smile and a thumbs-up.\n\nShe will joke on Twitter about missing her Keurig coffee but is looking forward to having good parking at Arizona Diamondbacks games in Phoenix.\n\nShe will have surgeries and spend days in the intensive care unit, and come out sounding as though life couldn\u2019t be grander.\n\nThe six-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer, who suffered a severed spinal cord in an all-terrain vehicle accident in Show Low, Ariz., on June 6 and is paralyzed from the waist down, has amazed her fans and followers with her upbeat attitude.\n\nBut those who know her aren\u2019t surprised.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s typical Amy,\u201d said Dara Torres, a 12-time Olympic medalist swimmer who competed with Van Dyken-Rouen at the 2000 Olympics. \u201cShe\u2019s probably one of the toughest athletes that I\u2019ve ever met, and I don\u2019t just mean that with what she accomplished; she obviously overcame asthma and won all those medals in 1996, and she\u2019s a tough girl.\u201d\n\nTorres won five gold medals in Sydney, one of which was won with Van Dyken-Rouen on the 4\u00d7100-meter freestyle relay team.\n\nBut it was their meeting in the pool about a month earlier, at the Olympic trials, that still serves as their most memorable time together \u2014 for Torres and perhaps many others.\n\n\u201d She spit in my lane,\u201d Torres said. \u201cI remember that like it was yesterday. Afterward, when we were warming down, I asked her, \u2018Did you really just spit in my lane?\u2019 And she was like, \u2018Yep.\u2019 So I said, \u2018You do know that I\u2019m older than you and it doesn\u2019t really bother me, right?\u2019 She just kind of laughed. She didn\u2019t spit in my lane again after that.\n\n\u201cTo me it was just funny. You\u2019re so focused. You\u2019re just about to get up at Olympic trials and try to make the Olympic team, and I heard this thing and I saw something flying in my lane, and I was like, \u2018What was that?\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cSpitgate\u201d brought them closer together, Torres said, and the Olympic sisterhood bond has been there since. When Torres heard about Van Dyken-Rouen\u2019s injury, her heart sank.\n\n\u201cWhen anything major like this happens to someone, whether you know them or not, it definitely puts it into perspective,\u201d Torres said. \u201cIt makes you not take life for granted. \u2026 But if anyone can overcome this, she can.\u201d\n\nKenny Lofton agrees. He has seen it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in awe, but I\u2019m not surprised, because of her spirit,\u201d said Lofton, a former baseball star who played in the major leagues from 1991-2007. \u201cIf you were to just read a text from her or hear her talk, you\u2019d be like, \u2018Did this lady just have an accident or not?\u2019 because of how she\u2019s acting. If anybody can go through this upbeat, it can be her.\u201d\n\nLofton had known of Van Dyken-Rouen for years because of their University of Arizona ties \u2014 he attended the school from 1987-91 on a basketball scholarship, and she was there from 1992-94 before transferring to Colorado State \u2014 but they met for the first time at the Caddies 4 Cure charity golf event in Portland, Ore., this year. They instantly hit it off.\n\n\u201cShe hit a hole-in-one,\u201d Lofton said. \u201cI was all over her about that, because when you hit a hole-in-one, you have to buy drinks for everybody.\u201d\n\nVay Dyken-Rouen didn\u2019t do so and Lofton gave her grief.\n\n\u201cSo the next day we ended up going to Starbucks and I made her buy me a Chai tea,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that was her hole-in-one drink.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Amy Van Dyken-Rouen\u2019s upbeat attitude no surprise", "title": "Amy Van Dyken-Rouen\u2019s upbeat attitude no surprise", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/06/19/amy-van-dyken-rouens-upbeat-attitude-no-surprise/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140619__20140620_B3_SP20VANDYKEN1p1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140619__20140620_B3_SP20VANDYKEN1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-06-19T22:26:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:04:22+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Amy Van Dyken-Rouen wants to \u201crock out\u201d her wheelchair.\n\u201cIt\u2019s typical Amy,\u201d said Dara Torres, a 12-time Olympic medalist swimmer who competed with Van Dyken-Rouen at the 2000 Olympics.\n\u201d She spit in my lane,\u201d Torres said.\nShe wants it to have skulls and crossbones, and she wants it to be purple, with her hair to match.\nWhen Torres heard about Van Dyken-Rouen\u2019s injury, her heart sank."}
