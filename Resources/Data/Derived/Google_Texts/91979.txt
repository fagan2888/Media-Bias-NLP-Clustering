The Nuggets will play an eight-game preseason schedule that includes a return to the Coors Events Center at the University of Colorado on Oct. 21 against the Portland Trail Blazers, the team announced Friday afternoon.

The Nuggets last played on the CU campus in Boulder in 2007, also against the Trail Blazers. Nuggets season-ticket holders will receive priority access to purchase tickets to the Portland game, with details to follow at a later date.

In addition, the Nuggets will face all-star forward Kevin Durant and the Oklahoma City Thunder at Pepsi Center on Oct. 8.

Denver’s other six games will be on the road, starting with the preseason opener against the Los Angeles Lakers in San Diego on Oct. 6.

The Nuggets also will play the Phoenix Suns, Chicago Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers (in Las Vegas) and the Golden State Warriors twice — once in Des Moines, Iowa, and again in Oakland, Calif.
