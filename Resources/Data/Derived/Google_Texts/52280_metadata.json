He said employers are required to offer an insurance plan that covers at least 60 percent of medical expenses, which is the same percentage covered by the lowest plan on the public health insurance marketplace. At the same time, the plan\u2019s monthly premium must be no more than 9.5 percent of the employee\u2019s household income \u2013 otherwise it is considered \u201cunaffordable,\u201d according to the reform law.\n\nThis means what is affordable to one employee may not be to another, which in turn means added paperwork and oversight for employers to ensure they are in compliance, said Alysia Doerbecker, senior district manager for ADP payroll services.\n\n\u201cThere is a laundry list of information that you need to be prepared for,\u201d Ms. Doerbecker said.\n\nAs a result, she said, a proficient human resources system to keep tabs on all the information could be vital.\n\nShould a company slip up, it may be subject to penalties or open itself to a lawsuit, said John Hudson, president of True Benefit, LLC, an employee benefits brokerage and consulting firm.\n\nAfter 90 days, new employees become eligible to join the company\u2019s health care plan, should they offer one, Mr. Hudson said. \u201cYou better track [those] employee[s] accurately. If they should have been offered coverage, it\u2019s going to come back to you as an employer from a lawsuit perspective.\u201d\n\nTo enforce the new regulations, Michael Vigliotta, an attorney at The Law Offices of Thomas M. Volz, said the Internal Revenue Service is hiring more than 6,500 new employees to ensure businesses are in compliance.\n\nSusan Flatley, manager of North Fork Radiology, which has 60 full-time employees, said she was expecting added oversight, \u201cbut not to the extent of what I heard here today.\u201d\n\nAnd for those considering not offering affordable care, \u201cthe penalties are larger than I had anticipated,\u201d she said. The penalty is generally equal to $2,000 for each full-time employee, excluding the first 30 employees. Should an employee enroll in the marketplace and qualify for a government subsidy, additional fees could be incurred.\n\nBruce Talmage, owner of Talmage Agway in Riverhead, has about 17 full-time employees, which puts him in the small business category.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like I am not required to provide a health plan, but I currently do, and I am trying to understand the rules,\u201d Mr. Talmage said. He said many of his questions have to do with his ever-changing work force because the store gets busier during the spring and summer landscaping seasons.\n\nTalmage wears an interesting couple of hats, as he\u2019s also involved with the nonprofit Riverhead Volunteer Ambulance Corps, which has about 17 full-time employees. While the nonprofit has not offered health coverage in the past, he said they are looking into getting it.\n\nAs a small business, he is not required to offer health insurance, but there are tax incentives for small businesses that do so, according to the Small Business Assistance Program, a state-run nonprofit supporting affordable health insurance.\n\n\u201cIf I do continue to offer one, does it have to be to every single employee? Is there a limit on the number of hours they work?\u201d Mr. Talmage asked.\n\nAccording to the law, as long as his work force does not exceed 50 full-time workers for more than 120 calendar days, he will still be considered a small business.\n\nRaising even more questions for Talmage, the insurance plan he currently offers his employees will no longer be offered come Jan. 1, so it\u2019s as if he is starting at square one, he said.\n\nThere are also unanswered questions on the health care provider side.\n\nAn estimated 57 million uninsured people stand to gain access to affordable health care, however there are already shortages of primary care physicians to provide it, said Dr. George Ruggierio, chief of family medicine and director of medical education at PBMC.\n\n\u201cPrimary care physicians are already under strain. Who\u2019s going to see these people?\u201d Dr. Ruggierio said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services estimates that the physician supply will increase by only 7 percent in the next 10 years, far less than the more than 36 percent increase in the patient population, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\n\u201cThere are concerns across the board \u2013 the insurance industry, hospitals and doctors trying to deliver care,\u201d Dr. Ruggierio said.\n\nUnfortunately, not all of the questions are answered yet, said Randy Blum, a representative from United Healthcare \u2013 an insurance provider offering coverage on New York\u2019s insurance exchange. \u201cAt this point nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nWhile much remains uncertain for health care providers, small business owners seeking the right plan and employees themselves, Lauren McKissick, owner of Prominent Swimming Pools Inc. of Calverton \u2013 which has just a handful of employees \u2013 said that either way, she believes offering health benefits is important to keeping loyal employees.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to lose good people over insurance issues,\u201d she said. \u201cBut is it going to be more affordable to workers if we break off and no longer offer it?\u201d\n\n[email protected]\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "andrew mitchell,health insurance,obamacare,peconic bay medical center,taming healthcare 2014", "og": {"url": "http://riverheadnewsreview.timesreview.com/2013/10/48702/symposium-offers-a-dose-of-information-on-health-care-reform/", "image": "http://media.timesreview.com.s3.amazonaws.com/riverheadnewsreview/files/Insurance.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Symposium offers a dose of information on health care reform", "title": "Symposium offers a dose of information on health care reform"}, "fb": {"admins": "64401241,16320909,508876025,591622321,114502230", "app_id": 115179118576729}, "description": "Symposium offers a dose of information on health care reform", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "After 90 days, new employees become eligible to join the company\u2019s health care plan, should they offer one, Mr. Hudson said.\nThere are also unanswered questions on the health care provider side.\nAs a small business, he is not required to offer health insurance, but there are tax incentives for small businesses that do so, according to the Small Business Assistance Program, a state-run nonprofit supporting affordable health insurance.\nBruce Talmage, owner of Talmage Agway in Riverhead, has about 17 full-time employees, which puts him in the small business category.\n\u201cIt sounds like I am not required to provide a health plan, but I currently do, and I am trying to understand the rules,\u201d Mr. Talmage said."}
