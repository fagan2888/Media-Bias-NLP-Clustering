Those two deals alone could pay out up to $345 million in fees to Wall Street.\n\n\u200bAnd then of course there's the Wall Street money tree Allergan.\n\nIt recently made a deal to be bought by Israeli pharmaceutical Teva for about $40.5 billion. That was the latest in a series of deals involving Allergan, including when Actavis bought the company and kept the name.\n\nThose two firms had generated some $780 million in fees for Wall Street between 2012 and the July deal with Teva.\n\nNow the total should be somewhere closer to $820 million. JPMorgan is expected to receive between $35 million and $45 million in fees from Allergan for that deal.\n\nJPMorgan tops the league tables in healthcare banking, according to Dealogic, with an 11.6% share of fees. Goldman Sachs follows with 10.5%, while Morgan Stanley has 7.3% of fees.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Portia Crowe", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Investment banks have made $7.6 billion so far this year advising healthcare companies on equity and debt deals and takeovers.", "creator": "PortiaCrowe", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-banks-are-making-money-in-healthcare-sector-2015-9", "image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5603f54bbd86ef17008bca9a-506-253/wall-street-dealmakers-are-crushing-it-in-one-industry.jpg", "title": "Wall Street dealmakers are crushing it in one industry", "site": "clusterstock", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "clusterstock", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Wall Street, Investment Banks, Healthcare, Healthcare Banking, Fees, JPMorgan, Portia Crowe", "description": "Investment banks have made $7.6 billion so far this year advising healthcare companies on equity and debt deals and takeovers.", "author": "Portia Crowe", "sailthru.date": "2015-09-24", "sailthru.title": "Wall Street dealmakers are crushing it in one industry", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5603f459bd86ef13008bcb07-50-50/wall-street-dealmakers-are-crushing-it-in-one-industry.jpg", "news_keywords": "Wall Street, Investment Banks, Healthcare, Healthcare Banking, Fees, JPMorgan, Portia Crowe", "tbi-image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5603f459bd86ef13008bcb07/wall-street-dealmakers-are-crushing-it-in-one-industry.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2015-09-24", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/portia-crowe"}, "sailthru.description": "Investment banks have made $7.6 billion so far this year advising healthcare companies on equity and debt deals and takeovers.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Investment banks have made $7.6 billion so far this year advising healthcare companies on equity and debt deals and takeovers.", "title": "Wall Street dealmakers are crushing it in one industry", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/wall-street-banks-are-making-money-in-healthcare-sector-2015-9", "image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5603f54bbd86ef17008bca9a-1190-625/wall-street-dealmakers-are-crushing-it-in-one-industry.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "Wall Street dealmakers are crushing it in one industry", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5603f459bd86ef13008bcb07/wall-street-dealmakers-are-crushing-it-in-one-industry.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "clusterstock"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce1f6\"", "article_summary": "One industry \u2014 and one industry alone \u2014 has been good to Wall Street dealmakers this year.\n\u200bAnd then of course there's the Wall Street money tree Allergan.\nThose two firms had generated some $780 million in fees for Wall Street between 2012 and the July deal with Teva.\nThose two deals alone could pay out up to $345 million in fees to Wall Street.\nJPMorgan is expected to receive between $35 million and $45 million in fees from Allergan for that deal."}
