And with great power comes great responsibility.\u201d\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nClapper took this as an invitation to appropriate Spider-Man and use the superhero as a frame for all of his remarks. He admitted he did not think he was Spider-Man, but said, \u201cI feel like I have a personal connection to the web-slinger.\u201d\n\nLike Spider-Man, the Intelligence Community Faces \u201cTough Choices\u201d\n\nThe remarks at the end of the speech were reflective and earnest.\n\nOffering his own thumbnail history of comic books, Clapper said prior to Spidey, \u201cMost comic books primarily depicted the external struggle between the superhero and the super-villain. It was \u2018Superman versus Lex Luthor \u2013 with Kryptonite.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWith Peter Parker, for the first time, comic readers saw a hero\u2019s inner struggles,\u201d Clapper said. \u201cThey shared his experiences of trying to keep his job and earn enough to survive, trying to talk to girls, and watching helplessly as a loved one, his Uncle Ben, dies. And more than anything else, Peter struggled with deciding what to do when his principles, his personal values, came in conflict with each other.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what made Spider-Man such an interesting character to follow. People have always related to his inner struggle with decisions. Peter found that, sometimes he couldn\u2019t keep a promise to a friend and at the same time, as Spider-Man, help someone in need.\u201d\n\nTo Clapper, like Spider-Man, the people of the \u201cintelligence community\u201d [IC] face similar \u201ctough choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this often gets lost in the public discussion,\u201d Clapper argued. \u201cWe, as an institution and as a workforce, have principles and values that sometimes come into conflict; things like: our need to keep sources and methods secret, and our desire to be more open and transparent with what we do; things like: pursuing terrorists and others who want to do harm and protecting the privacy and civil liberties of the typical citizens \u2013 not just of this country, but of the world \u2013 who are rarely, but sometimes caught up in our collection efforts against the bad guys.\u201d\n\nThis is preposterous and a brazen example of government using a well-known piece of American culture for propaganda.\n\nThe history of U.S. intelligence is one of agencies seeking to keep their operations secret from the public. The National Security Agency has been jokingly referred to as \u201cNo Such Agency.\u201d It was created by President Harry S. Truman in 1952 in total secrecy.\n\nSenator Frank Church warned in 1975, it had vast capabilities that, if turned on Americans, would mean no American had any privacy left. The agency could monitor everything from phone conversations to telegrams. \u201cThere would be no place to hide.\u201d\n\nThe Constitution and civil liberties have always been inconveniences to the intelligence community, which only take on great importance when there is scandal and Congress takes rare interest in curtailing programs operated by intelligence agencies. Then Clapper and others have to pay lip service to principles of privacy and talk about respecting civil liberties, even as they work behind-the-scenes to preserve Stasi-like surveillance programs.\n\nClapper additionally shared, \u201cSolutions for these conflicts are not always obvious. I\u2019ve been in meetings in which we, literally, pulled out our copies of the Constitution and Bill of Rights to get to the ground truth of what our principles and our obligations are. Wrestling with Constitutional issues to make difficult decisions is part of our daily business and is just a fragment of what makes an IC career so unique.\u201d\n\nThis is pure propaganda. NSA whistleblower Thomas Drake had concerns about domestic surveillance in 2001 after the September 11th attacks. He went to Vito Potenza, the NSA Deputy General Counsel from 1993 to 2006. Drake claimed \u201cThe Program,\u201d which was gathering data from the phone calls and Internet communications of Americans, was unconstitutional. Potenza did not want to be bothered by Drake.\n\nIn fact, for PBS Frontline\u2019s \u201cThe Program,\u201d Potenza said, \u201cThe minute he said, if he did say, \u201cYou\u2019re using this to violate the Constitution,\u201d I mean, I probably would have stopped the conversation at that point, quite frankly. So I mean, if that\u2019s what he said he said, then anything after that I probably wasn\u2019t listening to anyway.\u201d\n\nWhat is probably true is Clapper and others pull out their Constitution or Bill of Rights and read the words to see how they can manipulate language in the documents to justify expanding a surveillance program.\n\nGoing Further Down the Rabbit Hole\n\nFor a more disturbing glimpse into the pathology of the head of America\u2019s global security state, Clapper joked and rattled off a list of superficial comparisons.\n\n\u201cThat line, \u2018With great power comes great responsibility,\u2019 was used to introduce Spidey\u2019s first comic book appearance in 1962. And, in the spring of 1963, just as I was starting off in the intelligence business, Marvel published the first issue of \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man.\u201d Coincidence?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe constantly have to worry about cover concerns, someone matching our secret identities to our everyday, normal lives,\u201d Clapper declared. \u201cBoth Spider-Man and his alter-ego Peter Parker are known for their genius-level intellect. We in the IC are known for our geniuses \u2013 in subjects ranging from mathematics and cryptology, to denial and deception, and even rocket science.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cSpider-Man is known for his superhuman strength. A few days a week, I lift weights in our office gym. And my spotter says I\u2019m pretty strong, for a geezer. [laughter] Of course, my spotter is normally one of my security detail guys. So his evaluation of my weight-room prowess may be a bit biased.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpider-Man is known for his precognitive \u2018Spidey Sense.\u2019 Many of our customers expect us to be clairvoyant when it comes to world events,\u201d Clapper said.\n\nThis is not entirely accurate. Spider-Man\u2019s precognitive sense involves a psychological awareness of his immediate surroundings, and it is not necessarily an ability to predict what events will happen next. For the IC to have this \u201cSpidey Sense,\u201d it would have to be able to detect someone, who was downloading secret files to take with him to Hong Kong where he could expose a global mass surveillance apparatus to the world. Of course, the IC had no awareness that this was happening when Edward Snowden committed his courageous act, and the world benefited from the IC\u2019s lack of superpower.\n\nClapper continued, \u201cSpidey is known as the \u201cweb-slinger,\u201d because he shoots spider webs from devices on his wrists. Some of the bad guys derisively call him \u201cwebhead.\u201d More and more, we in the IC are focused on cyber intelligence and the World Wide Web. Okay, I\u2019ll grant you, that\u2019s a stretch.\u201d\n\nAs if this was not ridiculous enough, Clapper compared the Spider-Man franchise, not the superhero, to \u201cgovernance\u201d of the \u201cIntelligence Community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are even similarities between Spider-Man and the IC when it comes to governance,\u201d Clapper added. \u201cStan Lee and Marvel created Spider-Man and still publish Spidey comics, but Sony Pictures has creative control of Spidey on film. Similarly, every IC agency and element other than CIA and ODNI are in someone else\u2019s cabinet department, and so integrating priorities and resources across the IC is not easy, particularly when it comes to following the different laws, rules, and processes that resides in each of the departments.\u201d\n\nIf We\u2019re Going to Compare U.S. Intelligence to Marvel Comics\u2026\n\nClapper returned to Spider-Man\u2019s creed, \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility,\u201d and ended his speech.\n\n\u201cThat line so succinctly describes what the people of the intelligence community try to live up to, every day: to show that we\u2019re worthy of America\u2019s trust and that we\u2019re worthwhile, because \u2013 spoiler alert \u2013 we\u2019re not comic book characters. We\u2019re Americans working to protect our nation, and at the same time, striving to live up to our nation\u2019s values.\u201d\n\nThrough whistleblowers like Snowden, Drake, and Chelsea Manning, and through journalists like Jeremy Scahill, Glenn Greenwald, and Nick Turse, it is evident Clapper is focused on the wrong comic book character. He should be looking in the pages of Captain America and various other Marvel comic books for Hydra in order to gain insights into the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nAs Marvel\u2019s website describes, \u201cHydra is a world-wide subversive organization dedicated to global domination.\u201d It is \u201cthe most extensive, powerful, and dangerous such organization in history.\u201d It is mostly dominated by men. It \u201cprides itself on its ability to regroup and rebuild itself, allegedly mightier than before, after any major defeat. Indeed, the organization has now endured for four decades.\u201d\n\nThis sounds like the U.S. intelligence community after Sen. Church spurred investigations into the security state and pushed for greater restraints. U.S. intelligence has found a way to bounce back and use regulations to indoctrinate overseers into their daily operations so they do not fiercely challenge them. Plus, post-9/11, U.S. intelligence grew exponentially to reassert itself in the face of a terrorist group, which had exposed America\u2019s vulnerability.\n\n\u201cThe man most responsible for the creation of Hydra was Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, the Prussian aristocrat who served as wing commander of Nazi Germany\u2019s infamous Death\u2019s Head Squadron, and later as leader of its Blitzkrieg Squad of commandos,\u201d according to Marvel.\n\nU.S. intelligence has a history of collaboration with Nazis. During the Cold War, U.S. intelligence agencies utilized 1,000 Nazis as Cold War spies. Agencies then covered up the role Nazis played in efforts.\n\nIn the \u201cCaptain America: Winter Soldier\u201d movie, Hydra is an organization that learns post-World War II that humanity has surrendered freedom willingly otherwise people will resist. S.H.I.E.L.D., the \u201cespionage, law-enforcement, and counter-terrorism agency,\u201d was founded in the U.S., and German scientists were recruited and became a parasite inside the organization at its beginning. And, for 73 years, Hydra secretly fueled crisis.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies have been responsible for the overthrow governments in more than 35 countries. Many more attempts at overthrows have been launched. Dirty wars fueled by U.S. intelligence have, especially with the proliferation of drones, helped to destabilize countries like Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, Syria, Libya, and Mali. And Snowden showed how numerous dragnets spread out all over the globe have intercepted the communications of millions of innocent citizens.\n\nWhile Spider-Man is motivated by guilt, regret, and agony when he cannot save people, U.S. intelligence agencies see the loss of countless civilians as \u201ccollateral damage.\u201d There is no duty or moral obligation to apologize or atone for the massive amount of death perpetrated by agencies who run the American empire.\n\nThe men and women inside U.S. intelligence agencies remain undercover and faceless not because their vigilante acts serve justice but because, if global citizens knew what they really did each day, the world would shun them even more.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cSpider-Man is known for his precognitive \u2018Spidey Sense.\u2019 Many of our customers expect us to be clairvoyant when it comes to world events,\u201d Clapper said., AFCEA, Director of the National Intelligence, INSA, Intelligence, James Clapper, Spider-Man,", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Kevin Gosztola | Shadowproof", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "\u201cSpider-Man is known for his precognitive \u2018Spidey Sense.\u2019 Many of our customers expect us to be clairvoyant when it comes to world events,\u201d Clapper said., AFCEA, Director of the National Intelligence, INSA, Intelligence, James Clapper, Spider-Man,", "title": "Spy Chief James Clapper Compares U.S. \u2018Intelligence Community\u2019 To Spider-Man", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/spy-chief-james-clapper-compares-u-s-intelligence-community-to-spider-man/209480/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AP922099395712.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-12T09:22:49-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cSpider-Man is known for his precognitive \u2018Spidey Sense.\u2019 Many of our customers expect us to be clairvoyant when it comes to world events,\u201d Clapper said., AFCEA, Director of the National Intelligence, INSA, Intelligence, James Clapper, Spider-Man,", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/AP922099395712.jpg", "title": "Spy Chief James Clapper Compares U.S. \u2018Intelligence Community\u2019 To Spider-Man", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "Spider-Man", "published_time": "2015-09-12T05:00:20-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-12T09:22:49-05:00"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe22da\"", "article_summary": "The spy chief of the United States compared the American \u201cintelligence community\u201d to the Marvel superhero Spider-Man in a speech he gave at an intelligence summit on September 9.\nSpy Chief James Clapper Compares U.S. \u2018Intelligence Community\u2019 To Spider-Man\u201cSpider-Man is known for his precognitive \u2018Spidey Sense.\u2019 Many of our customers expect us to be clairvoyant when it comes to world events,\u201d Clapper said.\nIn a description for Director of the National Intelligence James Clapper, the organizers of the AFCEA/INSA National Security and Intelligence Summit wrote, \u201cU.S.\nU.S. intelligence agencies have been responsible for the overthrow governments in more than 35 countries.\nDuring the Cold War, U.S. intelligence agencies utilized 1,000 Nazis as Cold War spies."}
