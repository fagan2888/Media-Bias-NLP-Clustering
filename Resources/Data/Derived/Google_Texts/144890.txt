Don't look now, but even New Yorker magazine is piling on the disaster that is ObamaCare.

Take a gander at the cover for the issue to hit newstands Monday:

For our younger readers that might not get all of the jokes here, the computer appears to be one of the first available to the public in the '70s.

The technician on the left is trying to insert a floppy disc which probably ceased being used about ten years ago or so.

The hammer and screw driver should be obvious.

As for Obama, he's holding one of the original cellphones dating back to the '80s.

Add it all up, the folks at New Yorker are making the case that when it comes to technology, this administration is in the dark ages.
