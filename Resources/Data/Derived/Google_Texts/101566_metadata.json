So nervous, he brought his mom.\n\nThe wariness that he may have faced during his first trip to Democrat Days was nowhere to be found this year, as attendees rushed to grab photos with the state\u2019s now second-term attorney general and encouraging him as he readies to be the party\u2019s standard-bearer in 2016. Here in Hannibal and elsewhere on the campaign trail, Koster does not shy from talking about his party switch. And when he brings it up, he gets cheers.\n\nSpeaking here on Saturday as the party\u2019s presumptive nominee for governor in 2016, Koster said the same issues that brought him to Hannibal after leaving the Republican Party in 2007 are the issues that the state is facing, yet again, in 2014.\n\n\u201cI quit my party over a disagreement over public health,\u201d he told Democrats gathered for an annual brunch.\n\nKoster touted his support of the 2010 federal health care law, noting new access to contraceptive services for women and a provision barring insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions. Koster questioned why Republicans were against the policy, parts of which were first pitched by conservative groups in the 1990\u2019s as an alternative to then-First Lady Hilary Clinton\u2019s health care proposal.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act was a Republican idea, for goodness sake,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an honest to god Republican idea, they\u2019re just pissed we stole it.\u201d\n\nKoster said perhaps his biggest frustration with his former party\u2019s health care positioning now is its opposition to Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u201cThis expansion proposal is the best darn economic development proposal this state has seen in the last 25 years,\u201d he said. \u201cFor no other reason than because Barack Obama passed it, this legislature is willing to deny the health and economic benefits of expansion simply to spite a president.\u201d\n\nKoster noted support from the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and former U.S. Sen. Kit Bond, a Republican who was a vocal opponent of the 2010 health care law, which was passed during his final year in the Senate. Koster said the potential economic benefits of Medicaid expansion are undeniable.\n\n\u201cThe bill has been passed. Sen. Bond is walking the halls trying to convince Democrats and Republicans to accept $2 billion,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIf you had $2 billion dollars sitting on your front door, wouldn\u2019t you take it?\u201d\n\nOne reason Republicans offer is broad public opposition in Missouri and elsewhere to the federal health care law. When different provisions of the law have been on the ballot, Missourians have overwhelmingly opposed them. Still, Koster said he believes Medicaid expansion is different.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is unpopular, but the $2 billion federal offer and the expansion of economic opportunity that is being offered to us doesn\u2019t strike me as unpopular,\u201d he said. \u201cIncreasingly when I talk with members of the General Assembly, including Republicans, they are looking for a way out of this.\u201d\n\nKoster\u2019s vocal support of the federal health care law stands in contrast to his only announced Republican opponent, former House Speaker Catherine Hanaway, who has voiced opposition to the law in full, including the Medicaid expansion provision.\n\n\u201cI am against any further expansion of Obamacare. Therefore, I am against Gov. Nixon\u2019s proposed expansion of Medicaid,\u201d she said earlier this month. \u201cI lived through the expansions of Medicaid that Gov. Carnahan put on the books and the strife required to shrink back those expansions when the state could no longer afford them.\u201d\n\nHanaway said she, like Republicans in the General Assembly, believes it would be \u201cill-advised for Missouri\u201d to accept the federal funds when they will be rolled back in 2020, requiring the state to take on a 10 percent share of the burden.\n\nKoster was the keynote speaker at the morning brunch in Hannibal. Secretary of State Jason Kander was scheduled to speak Saturday evening to the annual dinner.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.0.1", "og": {"site_name": "PoliticMo", "description": "HANNIBAL, Mo. \u2013 Chris Koster came to Hannibal for the annual Democrat Days gathering seven years ago this weekend as a first-time Democrat.
