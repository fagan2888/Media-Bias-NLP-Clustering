Emotional appeal is truly the only thing that can help them. Actual facts are not flattering to their movement.\n\nA recent Huff Post story was no different. It featured the work of photographer Liora K. Her series, aptly titled, \u201cFeminism,\u201d features half-naked women who have written various things on their bodies. If one clicks through to see all of Liora\u2019s photos in the series (which we don\u2019t suggest), one will see countless photos featuring coat hangers and pro-abortion phrases.\n\nOne woman\u2019s body \u201cart\u201d reads, \u201cPseudoscience kills women,\u201d apparently referring to the (inconvenient) scientific research supporting fetal pain beginning at 20 weeks (read about it here ) and post-abortive stress syndrome (read about that here ). Another woman has written: \u201cYou can\u2019t stop abortion\u201d with a coat hanger pointing ominously at her vagina. Another woman holds a coat hanger and her \u201cart\u201d reads \u201c5,000 dead.\u201d One woman\u2019s reads, \u201cI have a heartbeat too.\u201d Others are:\n\n\u201cWhat about my right to life?\u201d\n\n\u201cPro-woman. Pro-child. Pro-choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep your laws off my body.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Blank] your \u2018conscience clause.\u2019\u201d (This one refers to a clause the GOP tried to insert into Obamacare to allow employers to deny funding health services, like abortion, that they morally disagreed with.)\n\nEvery last one of those is an emotional argument. Facts reveal a much different reality.\n\n\u201cBack alley\u201d and coat hanger abortions and subsequent deaths have been resoundingly proven to be mythical, but the myth just won\u2019t die. Dr. Bernard Nathanson, the former abortionist and founder of NARAL, admitted to falsifying statistics about them after he became pro-life. He said, \u201cIt was always \u20185,000 to 10,000 deaths a year.\u2019 I confess that I knew the figures were totally false, and I suppose others did too if they stopped to think of it. But in the \u2018morality\u2019 of the revolution, it was a useful figure, widely accepted, so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics. The overriding concern was to get the laws eliminated, and anything within reason which had to be done was permissible.\u201d (1)\n\nPlanned Parenthood\u2019s own Alan Guttmacher said this about \u201cback alley\u201d abortionists: \u201cThe technique of the well-accredited criminal abortionist is usually good. They have to be good to stay in business, since otherwise they would be extremely vulnerable to police action.\u201d (2)\n\nThe truth is that 15 years before Roe v. Wade, 85% of illegal abortions were performed by physicians. (3) Planned Parenthood even admitted in 1960 that \u201c90% of all illegal abortions are presently done by physicians.\u201d (4) Research confirms that the actual number of abortion deaths in the 25 years prior to 1973 averaged 250 a year. (5) In I966, before the first state legalized abortion, 120 died from abortion. (6) By 1972 abortion was still illegal in 80 percent of the country, but the use of antibiotics had greatly reduced the risk. Hence, the number dropped to 39 maternal deaths from abortion that year. (7) Dr. Christopher Tietze, a prominent statistician associated with Planned Parenthood, maintained that these are accurate figures, with a margin of error no greater than 10 percent. (8)\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nAnother purely emotional statement featured in the series is: \u201cKeep your laws off my body.\u201d This one just doesn\u2019t make sense! Literally the moment someone gets in the car, they strap a law across their body in the form of a seatbelt. When motorcyclists in states with helmet laws get on their bikes, they fasten a law over their heads. When someone carries an insurance card in their wallet, thanks to Obamacare\u2019s requirement of being insured, they are literally carrying a law around in their pockets. Our bodies are affected by laws all the time. In fact, what law doesn\u2019t affect our bodies? You\u2019d probably be sitting in front of your computer for a long time trying to think of one. Laws exist for the precise reason of keeping people from hurting themselves or other people. In the case of abortion, pro-lifers are trying to pass laws that keep women from killing their babies. Pro-choicers are trying to pass laws to strengthen their right to kill babies. Both sides\u2019 laws affect real people\u2019s bodies.\n\nThe rest of the statements are sad attempts (and by sad, we mean heartbreaking) to justify a selfish decision. The abortion rights issue circles around one battle: which is greater, the right to live as you choose or the right to live at all? Liora\u2019s photo-essay documents one thing accurately: there are far too many women in America who have absorbed the emotional draw of \u201cmy body, my choice\u201d and think that responsibility for one\u2019s actions is an archaic, misogynistic thing of the past. In today\u2019s culture, where people riot when they feel they aren\u2019t getting paid enough, or given enough tax-funded welfare, this sentiment is all-too-common.\n\nThankfully, more and more people are realizing that little children shouldn\u2019t be sacrificed for convenience. We have a feeling that a pro-life version of Liora\u2019s essay would feature thousands standing for babies, not dozen standing for themselves. ( In fact, one already does. )\n\nSources (Because pro-lifers aren\u2019t scared of facts):", "article_metadata": {"description": "New Feminist Campaign to Defend Abortion Features Half-Naked Women Writing on Their Bodies", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "One thing abortion rights advocates are really, really good at is using emotional argumentation.
