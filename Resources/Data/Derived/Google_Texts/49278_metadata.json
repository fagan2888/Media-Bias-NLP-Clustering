There\u2019s club employees scheming to get Quarterback Tom Brady to give them sports memorabilia in exchange for deflating game balls beyond the limits prescribed by the NFL\u2019s rules and documentation of Brady\u2019s efforts to keep everybody calm after the scandal erupted.\n\nBut for pure, undiluted weirdness, nothing beats the 70+ page appendix to the report prepared by research firm Exponent in Menlo Park, Calif. The company was hired by attorney Ted Wells, who ran the investigation for the NFL, to essentially rule out the possibility that environmental or other factors might have accounted for the fact that the footballs used by the Patriots in their 45-7 American Football Conference Championship game win over the Indianapolis Colts were significantly under-inflated.\n\nRelated: Deflategate Follows Patriots to the Super Bowl\n\nAnd they delivered. Like mad scientists with an unlimited expense account.\n\nEver wonder what a football looks like when it\u2019s subjected to 650 pounds of pressure? Exponent\u2019s got you covered.\n\nWant a three-dimensional computer image of a football created by a high-definition laser scanner? No problem.\n\nEver wonder what it would look like if you hired some guy to put on a pair of wide receiver\u2019s gloves and \u201cvigorously rub\u201d a football for 20 minutes and then\u2026wait for it\u2026took pictures with an infra-red camera?\n\nBoom.\n\nRelated: The 10 Best Super Bowl Games of All Time\n\nHow about a graph showing minute-by-minute pressure changes in the football while it was being rubbed by some guy wearing wide receiver gloves? Oh, sure. At this point, why the hell not?\n\nNone of this is meant to disparage the work of the undoubtedly diligent scientists at Exponent. But in reading the report, you have to wonder why, once the attorneys discovered that one of the locker room attendants involved in the scandal referred to himself as \u201cthe deflator\u201d in text messages to a colleague, they didn\u2019t think, \u201cYou know, maybe we\u2019ve got enough here.\u201d\n\nFor some, the biggest disappointment in the report is that Brady, a quarterback beloved by millions, appears to have cheated. For others, it will be that the fee Exponent charged the NFL is not disclosed.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The NFL\u2019s report on the New England Patriots\u2019 ball-deflation scandal answers many questions.
