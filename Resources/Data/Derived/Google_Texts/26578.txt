A new poll conducted on Sunday by CNN/ORC reveals that about 43 percent of Republicans believe that U.S. President Barack Obama is a Muslim, while 20 percent of adults think he is foreign-born.

The poll finds that even though there remains a solid subsection of Americans who think that Obama was born outside of the United States, majority of Americans do believe that he is in fact born in the country.

Eighty percent of adults said he was born in the U.S., while the remaining 20 percent think that he was born outside the country, with 9 percent believing there is evidence of it and 11 percent believe based on their suspicions, according to CNN.

The president himself was able to produce a birth certificate, which proved that he was born in Hawaii after a similar poll was conducted in 2010 regarding his actual birthplace, according to The Hill.

In Obama's certified long-form birth certificate, it showed that he was born on August 4, 1961 at Kapiolani Hospital in Honolulu.

The CNN/ORC poll was conducted among 1,012 adults through telephone surveys from Sept. 4 to 8.
