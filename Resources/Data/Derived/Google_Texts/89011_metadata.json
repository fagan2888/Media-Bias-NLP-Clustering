A rare example of a coordinated digital effort within this genre, the weekly one-hour program is in direct response to the rise of music consumption via online services and mobile devices.\n\nThe partnership is meant to meet listeners where they are.\n\n\u201cYou can put a progressive show on the radio, but are you reaching the audience if radio is not the medium they\u2019re looking to receive it in?\u201d said Amy Niles, president and chief executive of WBGO.\n\nWBGO will be the show\u2019s primary audio producer, and performances will come mainly from Jazz at Lincoln Center, though some of the shows will come from other venues around the country.\n\nNPR will distribute the program to its member stations, more than 100 so far, and will consolidate its jazz coverage onto an online platform featuring a chat room and videos.\n\n\u201cWe want to make sure it connects to people in the way they listen to music now,\u201d said Anya Grundmann, director and executive producer at NPR Music.\n\nThe three organizations raised about $1 million to support the project.\n\n\u201cWhen you work together with strong strategic partners, everybody wins. You have a better shot of keeping things going longer,\u201d said Gabrielle Armand, a vice president at Jazz at Lincoln Center.\n\nJazz bassist Christian McBride will host the program, solidifying his emerging role as a leader in the field. He is jazz adviser at New Jersey Performing Arts Center, where he performs regularly and has input in programming.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s becoming an important spokesperson, curator and advocate,\u201d said the center\u2019s president and chief executive John Schreiber, who isn\u2019t involved with the radio program but created the advisory role for Mr. McBride. \u201cHe crosses generations in the best way and encourages a respect for the history of the music.\u201d\n\n\u201cJazz Night in America,\u201d which won\u2019t be live, will emphasize storytelling and the themes behind the music. But Mr. McBride said he hopes to hit a balance of smarts and swing.\n\n\u201cJazz is always fighting a battle of being cerebral,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad thing, but we don\u2019t want to turn off the people who are curious by being too dogmatic or too much on the academia side.\u201d\n\nThere may be times when Mr. McBride is performing in addition to his hosting duties, but he\u2019s hoping the audience will roll with it: \u201cPeople will listen to it and say \u2018Get a load of this guy. He\u2019s introducing himself.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWrite to Pia Catton at pia.catton@wsj.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2014-10-09T01:39:00.000Z",
