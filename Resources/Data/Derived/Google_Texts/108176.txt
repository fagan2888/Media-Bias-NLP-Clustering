James Keeter, 70, made his way inside the Oklahoma County Jail with little resistance.

A man is accused of impersonating a law enforcement officer and visiting an inmate after a security breach at the Oklahoma County Jail.

James Keeter, 70, made his way inside the Oklahoma County Jail with little resistance.

“He claimed to be an active probation officer or a deputy sheriff in Tulsa County,” said Oklahoma County Sheriff, John Whetsel.

Whetsel says the sheriff’s deputy who checked Keeter in, apparently didn't read Keeter's badge close enough. It clearly says "retired".

“But they allowed him to come in, in order to talk to an inmate that we later find out was being represented by one of his family members,” said Whetsel.

With an IPhone 4 in his possession, Keeter made his way all the way to an interview room and had a private visit with the female inmate, all under the guise of an official law enforcement interview.

“He was not supposed to be here at all,” said Whetsel.

Whetsel says he was being watched the entire time on surveillance monitors and it didn't take long for sheriff's deputies to realize something wasn't right.

“It didn’t look right. It didn’t appear right,” said Whetsel.

Keeter was arrested for four felony counts, including false personation of an officer and unauthorized entry into a prison.

“During that Friday night, Saturday night, Sunday period, it is busy. It is extremely busy,” said Whetsel. “And the employee just didn’t take enough time to make sure that the visit was appropriate.”

News 9’s Evan Anderson gave Keeter a call at his home in Sapulpa.

Evan: “Do you know what happened?”

James: “Yeah, but I’m not allowed to talk about it.”

The Sheriff says he’s confident that nothing actually happened inside the interview room, because Keeter was only inside a short time before being arrested.
