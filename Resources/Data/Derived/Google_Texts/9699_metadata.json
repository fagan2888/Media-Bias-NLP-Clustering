Administration officials have promised a functional website by the end of November.\n\nDuring testimony before the House and Senate, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, who ultimately oversees CMS, has apologized for the law's rough rollout and vowed to address the website's myriad problems. On Wednesday, during a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee, Sebelius said the website's debut period had been a \"miserable five weeks,\" but she batted aside suggestions that the law should be delayed to provide the administration time to fix the website.\n\nAccording to Snyder's email, Dave Nelson, currently Director of the Office of Enterprise Management at CMS, will serve as acting CIO upon Trenkle's departure.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tony Trenkle, chief information officer at the agency responsible for HealthCare.gov, will depart Nov. 15 for a private sector job", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/key-tech-official-behind-obamacare-website-to-step-down/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/11/06/1b4608ec-4783-11e3-a5af-047d7b15b92e/thumbnail/1200x630/7cb34d00ceec765e30a29a2723893770/trenkle.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Tony Trenkle, chief information officer at the agency responsible for HealthCare.gov, will depart Nov. 15 for a private sector job", "title": "Key tech official behind Obamacare website to step down"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tony Trenkle, chief information officer at the agency responsible for HealthCare.gov, will depart Nov. 15 for a private sector job", "title": "Key tech official behind Obamacare website to step down", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/key-tech-official-behind-obamacare-website-to-step-down/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/key-tech-official-behind-obamacare-website-to-step-down/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/key-tech-official-behind-obamacare-website-to-step-down/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "site": "@CBSPolitics", "image": "http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/11/06/1b4608ec-4783-11e3-a5af-047d7b15b92e/thumbnail/1200x630/7cb34d00ceec765e30a29a2723893770/trenkle.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/key-tech-official-behind-obamacare-website-to-step-down/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/key-tech-official-behind-obamacare-website-to-step-down/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPolitics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd83f4\"", "article_summary": "GovernmentCIOMagazine.com via YouTubeA key official at the agency responsible for spearheading the problematic rollout of Obamacare website HealthCare.gov will leave the administration for a job in the private sector, CBS News has learned.\nAdministration officials have promised a functional website by the end of November.\nAccording to Snyder's email, Dave Nelson, currently Director of the Office of Enterprise Management at CMS, will serve as acting CIO upon Trenkle's departure.\nSince its debut on October 1, the website has been afflicted by bugs and glitches that have prevented consumers from easily browsing and applying for health insurance plans.\nDuring his time as the agency's CIO, Trenkle oversaw $2 billion in annual information technology expenditures - among them, the development of HealthCare.gov, the federal insurance exchange website at the center of concerns about the shoddy rollout of the health-care reform law."}
