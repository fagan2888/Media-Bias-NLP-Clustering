Tea Party activists came from all walks of life and did not divide themselves up by age, gender, color, class or creed because they were focused on a greater purpose \u2013 to keep their nation free.\n\nFast forward to today and the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement.\n\nTo demonstrate \u201cpopular\u201d outrage against police departments, urban poverty and an outsized sense of entitlement, protesters came together to chant \u201cRev.\u201d Al Sharpton\u2019s trademark rant \u2013 \u201cNo Justice, No Peace\u201d. Now it seems that \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d protesters joined up to express their \u201coutrage\u201d for another reason \u2013 payday.\n\nAccording to the \u201cprofessional protesters\u201d camped out at \u201cMissourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment\u201d (MORE) headquarters (a successor organization to the now defunct ACORN group) \u2013 they aren\u2019t being paid.\n\nThis according to a report published by FrontPage magazine revealing that MORE had been paying protesters $5,000 a month to demonstrate in Ferguson. But now that the payments have stopped, the professional protesters provided by \u201cMillennials Activists United\u201d (MAU) are conducting a sit-in to get paid.\n\nAccording to a letter dripping with anti-white racism on MAU\u2019s website that speaks for itself:\n\n\u201cEarly in the movement, non-profit organization MORE, formerly known as the St. Louis chapter of ACORN, and local St. Louis organization Organization for Black Struggle created a joint account in which national donors from all over the world have donated over $150,000 to sustain the movement.\u201d \u201cSince then, the poor black [sic] of this movement who served as cash generators to bring money into St. Louis have seen little to none of that money. \u201cQuestions have been raised as to how the movement is to sustain when white non-profits are hoarding monies collected of off [sic] black bodies? When we will [sic] hold the industry of black suffering accountable? The people of the community are fed up and the accountability begins here and now,\u201d the statement said. \u201cWe NEED to be thinking about justice for black people\u2026\u201d \u201cThis means white people must renounce their loyalty to the social normalcy that maintains white power and control. If black lives really matter, justice and self-determination for black people would mean the black community would control [its] own political and economic resources. Moving forward, we are building a board of accountability within this movement. We must funnel economic into this movement through the hands of black people who are fighting with and for black life. More on this board will be discussed as we develop.\u201d\n\nIf Tea Party activists were paid to protest or published economic demands in letters laced with racism, it is unlikely that the Internal Revenue Service would have used its power to target Tea Party leaders, pepper Tea Party groups with paper to drive up its costs and to both to stop the Tea Party movement dead in its tracks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "To demonstrate outrage against police protesters came together.
