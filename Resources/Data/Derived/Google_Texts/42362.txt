Sean Flynn, 42, has announced his candidacy for the 31st Congressional District, which includes Redlands and San Bernardino, but not Highland, which is in the 8th Congressional District

Flynn is single, a native of the San Fernando Valley, and a resident of Upland since 2009.

Bright, articulate and sporting a Ph.D. in economics, Flynn brings some innovative ideas into the election.

For one thing, the Republican candidate does not want to abandon Obamacare without a good solution. His solution is to finance insurance company copay, which, he says, saves money and introduces competition in the health industry, leading to a cap on rising prices.

He says the change would result in spending only 4.7 percent of the budget on health care instead of the 18 percent now being spent. It would be similar to the system used in Singapore.

For education, he prefers that of Denmark with principals being given the power to hire and fire teachers, based on their ability and performance.

Economically, Flynn would like to return more power to the middle class.

Flynn is an associate professor of economics at Scripps College in Claremont. He is the author of “Economics for Dummies,” an international best seller translated into seven foreign languages, and co-author of the best-selling college economics textbook in the world, “Economics: Principles, Problems, and Policies.”

He is running for the seat now held by freshman Congressman Pete Aguilar, a Democrat of Redlands.
