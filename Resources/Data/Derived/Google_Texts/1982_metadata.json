The nuns versus ObamaCare\n\n\u201cBut [we] remain confident that our final rules strike the balance of providing women with free contraceptive coverage while preventing non-profit religious employers with religious objections to contraceptive coverage from having to contract, arrange, pay, or refer for such coverage,\u201d the White House said.\n\nBut Sotomayor's decision to delay the contraceptive portion of the law was joined by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which also issued an emergency stay for Catholic-affiliated groups challenging the contraceptive provision, including the Archdiocese of Washington, D.C., and Catholic University.\n\nSeparately, Lawyer Noel J. Francisco had said in appeals to Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Elena Kagan that the mandate would \"expose numerous Catholic organizations to draconian fines unless they abandon their religious convictions and take actions that facilitate access to abortion-inducing drugs, contraceptives and sterilization for their employees and students.\"\n\nThe law requires employers to provide insurance that covers a range of preventive care, free of charge, including contraception. The Catholic Church prohibits the use of contraceptives.\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2012 upheld the constitutionality of the core of the Affordable Care Act, saying its insurance mandate and the tax penalty enforcing it fell within the power of Congress to impose taxes.\n\nThe Obama administration crafted a compromise, or accommodation, that attempted to create a buffer for religiously affiliated hospitals, universities and social service groups that oppose birth control. The law requires insurers or the health plan's outside administrator to pay for birth control coverage and creates a way to reimburse them.\n\nThat isn't enough, Francisco said.\n\n\"In short, under the accommodation, applicants must authorize their third party administrators or insurance companies to provide the very products and services they find morally objectionable,\" he said. \"Suffice it to say, the 'accommodation' does not resolve applicants' religious objection to participation in this regulatory scheme.\"\n\nRoberts and Kagan handle emergency requests for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Sixth Circuit. They can act by themselves or involve the rest of the court.\n\nFrancisco said that if Catholic organizations don't comply with the law, they face \"fines of $100 a day per affected beneficiary\" and if they drop their health care coverage, \"they will be subject to an annual fine of $2,000 per full-time employee after the first 30 employees, and/or face ruinous practical consequences due to their inability to offer a crucial health care benefit to employees.\"\n\nHe added: \"In short, applicants are faced with a stark choice: violate their religious beliefs or pay potentially crippling fines.\"\n\nMore than 90 million individuals participate in health plans excluded from the scope of the mandate, Francisco said. \"The government, however, has steadfastly refused to create a broader religious exemption, either for individuals seeking to run their businesses in accordance with their faith or for nonprofit religious organizations beyond houses of worship,\" he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt applauded Justice Sotomayor's move.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration's HHS mandate is an egregious and blatant violation of the religious freedom that Americans have enjoyed for more than 220 years since the ratification of the First Amendment,\u201d he said. \u201cNo American should be forced to surrender their religious freedom or abandon their deeply held religious beliefs.\u201d\n\nThe justices have already agreed to rule on whether businesses may use religious objections to escape a requirement to cover birth control for employees. The court will consider two cases involving Hobby Lobby Inc., an Oklahoma City-based arts and crafts chain with 13,000 full-time employees, and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp., a Pennsylvania company that employs 950 people in making wood cabinets.\n\nHobby Lobby won in the lower courts while Conestoga Wood Specialties lost. The combined cases probably will be argued in late March with a decision coming by summer.\n\nFox News' Shannon Bream, Joseph Weber and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
