Police say the men caught on a security camera outside a Madison home with large knives were playing a prank on the homeowner.

According to authorities, those men are actually contractors working at the home who just wanted to spook the homeowner. Their prank backfired when that homeowner didn't recognize them and contacted police.

Police say the men are extremely apologetic and never intended to harm anyone.

The surveillance was taken in the area of Chick Drive and Route 13 on Jan. 22.

Madison police want people to know that there is a lesson to be learned in all of this: Pranks like this could instill unnecessary fear in neighborhoods.

No charges are expected to filed. Right now, police are speaking with everyone involved.
