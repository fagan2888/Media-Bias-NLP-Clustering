The number of people who will develop diabetes, meanwhile, is just going to increase, while many endocrinologists retire. \u201cThere already is a significant shortage of adult endocrinologists,\u201d said Dr. Robert Vigersky, former president of the Endocrine Society and an author of the study, according to HealthDay. \u201cWithout a concerted effort to recruit more endocrinologists, the gap between the number of endocrinologists and the demand for their care will increase even further and patients will struggle to get the care they need.\u201d\n\nThe number of new endocrinologists to enter the field must rise at a rate of \u201c14 percent a year to close the gap in five years,\u201d Vigersky said. Endocrinologists are trained to diagnose diseases that have to do with the body\u2019s glands, which release hormones; including diabetes, metabolic disorders, osteoporosis, thyroid diseases, and infertility. Because endocrinologists earn less than other physician specialties, not many medical students are choosing to enter the field. \u201cImproved reimbursement rates that reflect the true value of endocrinologists\u2019 care are required to encourage more physicians to choose endocrinology as a specialty,\u201d Vigersky said.\n\nThe study also found that wait times will naturally increase if there\u2019s a shortage of professionals who can treat diabetes patients. The average wait time for adults making a non-urgent appointment with an endocrinologist was 37 days in 2012. Frighteningly enough, the wait time was the same in 1999 \u2014 despite a 52 percent increase in the amount of endocrinologists treating adults since then.\n\nDiabetes prevalence has grown by 45 percent over the past 20 years, with the largest growth seen in people ages 65 and older, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The rise in obesity over the past several decades has contributed significantly to the problem. A CDC study tracking this increase noted that it was \u201csignificant and worrisome,\u201d and that the study \u201cunderscore[s] the urgent need for planning and delivering primary prevention to the U.S. population and providing quality healthcare for this growing segment of the aging population.\u201d\n\nSource: Vigersky R, Fish L, Hogan P, et al.
