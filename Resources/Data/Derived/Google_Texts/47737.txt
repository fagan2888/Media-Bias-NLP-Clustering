After falling behind in their preparation last week, backup running back Ronnie Hillman and cornerback Kayvon Webster will be inactive for the Broncos’ game tonight against the Indianapolis Colts.

Hillman and Webster fell ill after the Broncos’ preseason game Aug. 28 and stayed behind for one night in the Dallas-area to receive medical treatment. They had to spend a second night in Dallas because they didn’t have proper identification to fly back on Friday.

Hillman and Webster were limited in practice Monday at Dove Valley but were cleared for full participation in the Broncos’ padded practice Wednesday.

However, John Fox and his coaching staff determined later in the week that Hillman and Webster had fallen too far behind in the team’s preparation and will keep them on the sidelines for the season opener.

With Hillman out, second-year back C.J. Anderson and rookie Juwan Thompson will back up starter Montee Ball. With Webster down, rookie Bradley Roby is expected to play in the nickel packages, along with starters Aqib Talib and Chris Harris. Veteran cornerback Tony Carter should also get more playing time.

Hillman and Webster are expected to play next week against the Kansas City Chiefs.
