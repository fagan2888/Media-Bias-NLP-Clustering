It came as a result of a routine physical and screening process, and Johnson drew on that experience to tout other benefits of the law.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m really excited about is the fact that now every kid can go get their shots, get their check-ups, their physicals. Parents can go get their physicals,\u201d he says in the video. \u201cEarly detection can save people\u2019s lives. I\u2019m living proof of that.\u201d\n\nJohnson also drew on his unanticipated health crisis to push young Americans to enroll in the law. \u201cAffordable health care is important to me because everybody deserves to have good health care. And when you think about it, it saved my life,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for that quality health care that I have, and that plan that I had, I probably would have been dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou never know when you\u2019re going to need it,\u201d Johnson says. \u201cYoung people, they think they\u2019re Superman, like nothing is ever going to happen to them. But trust me, one day something is going to happen and you\u2019re going to need a quality health plan. So make sure you get Obamacare.\u201d\n\nThat push for young, healthy enrollees is central to the success of Obamacare, which has so far enrolled 2.2 million people through the law\u2019s private health exchanges. By turning to Johnson, the White House is clearly aiming for that demographic \u2014 as well as at minority communities that make up sizable portions of the NBA fan base and also stand to benefit from the law. It has attempted to use sports to promote the law before, as teams like the Washington Nationals, Baltimore Ravens, and Pittsburgh Steelers all signed on to promote enrollment. Johnson\u2019s video, according to Yahoo, will soon be converted into an advertisement that will run on ESPN, ABC, and TNT during NBA broadcasts.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Lakers legend draws on his own experiences to urge enrollment in new health care law.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Lakers legend draws on his own experiences to urge enrollment in new health care law.", "title": "Magic Johnson Joins Campaign To Promote Obamacare", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/sports/2014/01/15/3165491/magic-johnson-joins-campaign-promote-obamacare/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/magicjohnsonap.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lakers legend draws on his own experiences to urge enrollment in new health care law.", "creator": "@Travis_Waldron", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/magicjohnsonap-321x214.jpg", "title": "Magic Johnson Joins Campaign To Promote Obamacare", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-sports", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/magicjohnsonap.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/magicjohnsonap.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-15T11:24:08+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8d43\"", "article_summary": "Sports Magic Johnson Joins Campaign To Promote Obamacare CREDIT: APMagic Johnson is now promoting Obamacare.\n\u201cAffordable health care is important to me because everybody deserves to have good health care.\nBut trust me, one day something is going to happen and you\u2019re going to need a quality health plan.\nIt has attempted to use sports to promote the law before, as teams like the Washington Nationals, Baltimore Ravens, and Pittsburgh Steelers all signed on to promote enrollment.\n\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for that quality health care that I have, and that plan that I had, I probably would have been dead.\u201d\u201cYou never know when you\u2019re going to need it,\u201d Johnson says."}
