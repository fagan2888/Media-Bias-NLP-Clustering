He has one great achievement in life: the Massachusetts health reform, which acted as a template for the Affordable Care Act. If he were a member of a sane political party, he\u2019d be boasting about that record. But he wanted to be president, which meant having to accommodate himself to his party; and in Iowa, 81 percent of Republicans say that Ben Carson\u2019s statement that Obamacare is the worst thing since slavery makes him more attractive as a candidate. So he has to trash the best thing he\u2019s done.\n\nSometimes, it turns out, he can\u2019t maintain the facade. The other day he took credit for setting the stage for Obamacare. Then he tried desperately to walk it back, claiming that Obamacare has failed \u2014 which is literally and figuratively the party line.\n\nWhich raises the question, if this is a failure, what would policy success look like?\n\nObamacare has led to a rapid drop in the number of uninsured, especially in states that have fully implemented its provisions. It hasn\u2019t covered everyone, but it wasn\u2019t expected to: it doesn\u2019t cover undocumented immigrants, and the relative complexity of the program always meant that some eligible people would fall through the cracks. The original CBO estimates were that eventually 92 percent of non-elderly residents would have coverage, and in Medicaid expansion states we\u2019re getting there.\n\nMeanwhile, the whole thing has come in well below projected costs; insurance premiums will rise for 2016, but after two years of remarkably small rises that still leaves things cheaper than expected. And overall health care spending has come in far below expectations.\n\nNone of the other terrible things that were supposed to happen \u2014 job loss, destruction of full-time employment, a surge in the budget deficit \u2014 have happened either.\n\nBut to be a good Republican you have to insist that it has been a disaster. And Mitt Romney is therefore in the position of trashing his own life\u2019s work. Sad. But he has nobody but himself to blame.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151024094303, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "October 24, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/Delusions of Failure ( 20151024 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "I almost feel sorry for Mitt Romney.", "title": "Delusions of Failure", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/delusions-of-failure/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "I almost feel sorry for Mitt Romney.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "October 24, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1445694183, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-10-24T13:43:03-04:00"}, "utime": 20151024134303, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20151024, "pdate": 20151024, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "I almost feel sorry for Mitt Romney.", "title": "Delusions of Failure", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/delusions-of-failure/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/24/delusions-of-failure/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Delusions of Failure", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "And Mitt Romney is therefore in the position of trashing his own life\u2019s work.\nPhotoSometimes you almost have to feel sorry for Mitt Romney.\nWhich raises the question, if this is a failure, what would policy success look like?\nHe has one great achievement in life: the Massachusetts health reform, which acted as a template for the Affordable Care Act.\nThen he tried desperately to walk it back, claiming that Obamacare has failed \u2014 which is literally and figuratively the party line."}
