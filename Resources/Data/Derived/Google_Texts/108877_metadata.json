After the previous incidents with veterans and the added expenditures involved in closing open spaces to keep veterans from paying their respects to the Honored Dead one would assume that even a novice politician would move to staunch the bleeding. But instead, it seems that the White House is doubling down, as reported at The Weekly Standard.\n\nVia William Jacobson, NBC\u2019s affiliate in Washington, D.C. reports that police ordered tourists and Vietnam war veterans who were visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall to leave the memorial at one point on Friday. After one group of veterans went around the barricade, \u201cthe park ranger told them the wall was closed,\u201d NBC\u2019s Mark Seagraves reported. \u201cLater another group of vets showed up and moved the barricades. At that point, the memorial filled with vets and tourists. That\u2019s when police came and moved everyone out.\u201d\n\nAs usual, it sounds like our veterans accounted themselves in a professional dignified manner, but were not going to put up with any nonsense.\n\nSegraves described the exchange as pleasant and respectful. The veterans then moved the barricade and walked down to the wall to pay their respects. But a flood of tourists followed even though the memorial is closed to the general public. \u201cThe consensus among the group of Vietnam veterans was we\u2019re going to go anyway. We\u2019ll go through the barricade,\u201d North Carolina resident Reid Mendenhall said. U.S. Park Police arrive to the scene, asked everyone to leave and put the barricade back into place. Conflict over the closure of D.C.\u2019s war memorials has drawn a lot of controversy this week.\n\nYes\u2026 a lot of controversy is putting it mildly. The President can pick all the battles with congressional Republicans that he likes and probably not draw too much political fire from the middle. But if you wanted to conduct a poll of who is least likely to be blamed for anything in this country by the general public, veterans visiting war memorials would have to come in somewhere near the bottom of the list, behind possibly only puppies.\n\nHow many more of these stories can the administration sustain before the \u201cno compromise, no negotiations\u201d crowd realizes that they\u2019re going to have to come to the table? Assuming, that is, that the stories actually make it onto the national news.\n\nUpdate: (Jazz) A bit more thoughtful perspective on this than I managed on short notice from Doug.\n\nQuite honestly, the closure of the open air memorials on the National Mall has been among the more bizarre post-shutdown moves that those in authority have taken. Ordinarily, these memorials are open all day and night every day of the year. To the extent that they are staffed, it is typically by National Park Service employees giving guided tours, not by Park Police (although there may be regular patrols of these memorials at night by officers as part of their regular rounds). The fact that these employees, who are essentially just tour guides aren\u2019t around doesn\u2019t really detract at all from the experience of visiting the memorials themselves\u2026 Many on the right have accused the Obama Administration of doing things like closing these memorials in an effort to inflict the most pain in a public manner as part of an effort to put pressure on the GOP. Frankly, I have no doubt that there might be some truth in that, and that the choices of what has and hasn\u2019t been closed may well have some political motivation behind it. However, it strikes me that some of these choices were made without considering of the public relations of doing so. The pictures of open air memorials that have always been open to the public being surrounded by barricades, or of World War II veterans having to essentially force their way in to the memorial to the war that they fought, doesn\u2019t really make for very good television or photography.\n\nI\u2019d probably have had to use a lot more curse words inappropriate for this site if I\u2019d written that much about it but well said none the less.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "You\u2019ve got to be kidding me", "title": "More veterans removed at Vietnam War Memorial", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/10/05/more-veterans-removed-at-vietnam-war-memorial/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-05T18:31:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-05T21:32:48+00:00"}, "keywords": "Barack Obama, government shutdown, veterans,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2663\"", "article_summary": "Via William Jacobson, NBC\u2019s affiliate in Washington, D.C. reports that police ordered tourists and Vietnam war veterans who were visiting the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall to leave the memorial at one point on Friday.\n\u201cThe consensus among the group of Vietnam veterans was we\u2019re going to go anyway.\nMore veterans removed at Vietnam War Memorialposted at 2:31 pm on October 5, 2013 by Jazz ShawWhen I first saw this story, I assumed that it almost had to be a hoax.\nConflict over the closure of D.C.\u2019s war memorials has drawn a lot of controversy this week.\nAfter one group of veterans went around the barricade, \u201cthe park ranger told them the wall was closed,\u201d NBC\u2019s Mark Seagraves reported."}
