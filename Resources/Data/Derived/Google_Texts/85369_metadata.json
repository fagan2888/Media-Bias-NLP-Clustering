To give it voice, he quoted, twice, a woman (a former Democratic staffer, it seems) in the gallery.\n\nIn contrast to previous Obama speeches, he took some care to cite accurate statistics. No mention of the discredited claim that one in five college women will be raped or the misleading claim that women\u2019s earnings are only 77 percent of men\u2019s.\n\nHe cheered America for being number one in oil and gas production \u2014 something his administration has tried to prevent.

More tax cuts for child care \u2014 but discrimination against stay-at-home moms and taxes on 529 college-savings accounts. Paid sick leave. Equal pay for women \u2014 on the books already for 52 years. A minimum-wage increase. He\u2019s all for infrastructure but, in deference to rich donors, will veto the Keystone XL pipeline.\n\nFree community college \u2014 even though it\u2019s already free to those in lower-income households, and despite the evidence from student-loan programs that colleges and universities sop up all the federal dollars with little gain to students.\n\nDemocrats, after applauding loudly in the first half of the speech, stayed mostly mum during much of the rest. There was silence when he called for trade-promotion authority and free-trade agreements. There was little noise when he called for tax reform \u2014 not surprisingly, given that he has ignored plans Republicans have put forward.\n\nThere was silence as well when he turned to foreign policy. Obama received better ratings on foreign than domestic policy in his first term; it\u2019s the other way around now.\n\nAmerica, he said, is \u201cstopping [the Islamic State\u2019s] advance,\u201d is \u201copposing Russian aggression,\u201d is ending a Cuba policy \u201clong past its expiration date,\u201d and \u201cour diplomacy is at work with respect to Iran.\u201d It is leading \u201cnot with bluster, but with persistent, steady resolve.\u201d But not, as most in the chamber and watching on TV know, with much in the way of results.\n\nObama seems finally to have realized that his divisive rhetoric has meant he hasn\u2019t delivered on the red-white-and-blue America vision of his 2004 Democratic National Convention speech. He devoted the last 24 paragraphs of his prepared text to addressing that criticism.\n\nBut not very convincingly. A president calling for big tax increases this Congress will never pass is not effectively seeking bipartisan accords. A president still blaming his predecessor \u2014 \u201cbluster\u201d \u2014 for foreign problems is not seeking unified support. A president who says \u201cwe stand united\u201d with the marchers in Paris but didn\u2019t go there himself isn\u2019t forging united action against the jihadists whose cause he refuses to name.\n\nIt looks like Obama is trying to set a left-wing agenda for his increasingly leftish party and to box in Hillary Clinton. But he hasn\u2019t come up with policy proposals that can withstand serious scrutiny. Just with sloganeering he can blame Republicans for opposing.\n\nThe bigger problem for Obama and the Democrats is that the perceived failures of the stimulus package and Obamacare have undermined the case for big government as much as the perceived success of the Reagan economic policies strengthened the case for cutting it back. \u201cBecause I won\u201d is a look back to the past, not a formula for the future.\n\n\u2014 Michael Barone is senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner. \u00a9 2015 The Washington Examiner.
