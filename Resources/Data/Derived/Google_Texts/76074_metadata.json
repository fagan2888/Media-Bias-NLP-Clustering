(Photo: Business Wire)\n\nSTANFORD, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Five-year-old Moriah Nelson of San Jose needs a lot of follow-up care for complex medical issues related to life-threatening birth defects. \u201cGoing to the doctor day after day is taxing,\u201d said dad Justin, \u201cso having Moriah\u2019s care close by means a ton in terms of convenience.\u201d\n\nChildren like Moriah are why Stanford Children\u2019s Health and Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford announced on Dec. 9 a new, larger location for its South Bay Specialty Clinic. Demand is so great for the clinic, currently in Los Gatos, that it will eventually move to a building in Campbell that allows more room for kids like Moriah. In doing so, Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford, the highest-ranked hospital for children and expectant mothers in Northern California, is expanding its capability for patients to access world-class care and world-class pediatricians \u2013 and is leading the way in extending this capability via the Stanford Children\u2019s Health network.\n\nIt\u2019s all a part of an important new model and system for health-care delivery in the Bay Area and in the United States.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s busy families, economic concerns and the Affordable Care Act are all drivers in changing the way Americans receive care,\u201d said gastroenterologist Kenneth Cox, MD, who is also a professor of pediatrics at the Stanford School of Medicine. \u201cQuality care that\u2019s more accessible \u2013 and in outpatient settings near where families live, reduces costs, increases convenience \u2013 and creates a better patient experience.\u201d\n\nThat experience can even have an effect on outcomes. Research from Cox\u2019s team shows that liver transplant outcomes are improved when quality care \u2013 like the care provided by Stanford Medicine physicians \u2013 is more accessible closer to where patients live.\n\nExpanded access means kids like Moriah can see urologists, neurologists, pulmonologists and more \u2013 without having to travel to Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford in Palo Alto for each specialty. Care not centered on a trip to the hospital is part of a growing national movement to add more value for the consumer. That\u2019s one of the reasons Stanford Children\u2019s Health and Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford have six multi-specialty pediatric specialty centers in the Bay Area: in San Francisco with partner California Pacific Medical Center; in Walnut Creek with John Muir Health; and in Emeryville, Palo Alto, Los Gatos and Capitola, where a new and expanded Santa Cruz-area location will begin seeing patients in January.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been expanding access to our services for more than a decade,\u201d said urologist William Kennedy, MD, who is also an associate professor of urology at the School of Medicine, noting that Stanford Children\u2019s Health and its core hospital \u2013 Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford \u2013 has partnerships, collaborations, telehealth and outreach at more than 100 locations in eight states. Expanding access is not just about specialty and sub-specialty care. In San Mateo, Contra Costa and Alameda counties, primary care pediatricians from Stanford Children\u2019s Health are now accessible within 10 miles of most homes.\n\nIncreasingly, consumers expect specialty care, well care and disease management to be accessible in outpatient settings like those of Stanford Children\u2019s Health. For the most complex, acute cases, they expect access to a leading hospital like Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford.\n\nIt\u2019s access families can depend on, since Stanford Children\u2019s Health and Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford provide care regardless of a family\u2019s ability to pay, resulting in more than $217 million in community benefits annually. That acute care is so in demand that the hospital is opening a 150-room expansion in December 2016, resulting in a total of 415 beds. This expansion will create the finest state-of-the-art acute and chronic care children\u2019s hospital in America, and allow the most modern, personalized labor and delivery experience possible for expectant moms.\n\nBy expanding access to one of the most sought-after brands in America, Stanford Children\u2019s Health and Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford are helping create a new system to deliver world-class care and extraordinary outcomes wherever patients need that care. And that makes families like Moriah\u2019s very happy.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a child with complex health issues,\u201d said Justin, \u201cyou don\u2019t normally have access to a doctor just down the street. Having the best of the best close by really means a lot.\u201d\n\nAbout Lucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford\n\nLucile Packard Children\u2019s Hospital Stanford is an internationally recognized 311-bed hospital and leading regional medical network providing a full complement of services for the health of children and expectant mothers.
