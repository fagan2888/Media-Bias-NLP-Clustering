In fourth or fifth grade, when he wasn\u2019t delivering copies of The Middletown Press to neighbors, Dickerson was writing programs in BASIC on an IBM PC his dad had brought home from work.\n\nOne of his projects, much to Debora\u2019s surprise, was programming a computer to play \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d for her.\n\n\u201cI had no idea computers could even make noise,\u201d she said. \u201cHe seemed to just instinctively understand how computers worked.\u201d\n\nDickerson continued learning new programming languages. According to Cromwell High School mathematics teachers O\u2019Rourke and Petrosky, programs Dickerson wrote for their graphing calculators \u2014 which were new to them at the time \u2014 are still being used today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a high that you can\u2019t explain when the student becomes the teacher, especially at that age,\u201d Petrosky said. \u201cIt reminds you of the potential of every student.\u201d\n\nDebora noted that other teachers noticed his abilities, too.\n\n\u201cHis (physics) teacher told me at parent-teacher conference that, when she gave a test, she always graded Michael\u2019s paper first,\u201d she said. \u201cIf his answer didn\u2019t agree with hers, she would check her answer before grading the rest of the papers.\u201d\n\nDickerson attended Pomona College in California, graduating with a degree in math in 2001 and returning to the school a year later as a systems administrator.\n\nIn 2005, Google reached out to him.\n\n\u201cIt seemed very unlikely that I\u2019d get an offer from them, so it was pretty exciting,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically what it probably feels like to get called up to Major Leagues if you\u2019ve been playing farm baseball for a long time.\u201d\n\nPartly as a result of connections between Google and Obama For America, Dickerson volunteered to help with Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 campaigns. Then, in mid-October last year, the government asked Dickerson, along with four others, to determine if the dysfunctional HealthCare.gov site was salvageable.\n\n\u201cIt was a national crisis and the President wanted just five people, so to be one of the five was pretty exciting,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Dickerson was summoned merely to do an assessment, he and the others were asked to stay at least until the end of November once it was determined the website could be saved.\n\n\u201cI only had a carry-on bag and, like, two changes of clothes, because we thought it was a two-day kind of thing,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cBut, that obviously turned into a six-month kind of thing.\u201d\n\nAs a site reliability engineer with management experience, rather than the more common software engineer, Dickerson became the group\u2019s natural leader, overseeing operations during the early morning, when traffic was high, and the late night, when fixes were implemented. During that period, he worked an average of 16 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nDebora admitted she was annoyed when Dickerson didn\u2019t come home for Thanksgiving. But, she said, he hadn\u2019t told her the extent of his role.\n\n\u201cIt really wasn\u2019t until Todd Park (U.S. Chief Technology Officer) called us just before midnight on Christmas Eve and told us how instrumental Michael was in rescuing Healthcare.gov that we realized he had actually been leading the effort,\u201d she said.\n\nThe March 10 edition of Time Magazine featured \u201cCode Red: Inside the nightmare launch of Healthcare.gov and the team that figured out how to fix it\u201d by Stephen Brill.\n\nIt\u2019s a dramatic story \u201cof a team of unknown \u2014 except in elite technology circles \u2014 coders and troubleshooters who dropped what they were doing in various enterprises across the country and came together in mid-October to save the website,\u201d Brill writes.\n\nHaving such a large role in something under the national \u2014 and global \u2014 microscope, Dickerson said, was \u201cvery stressful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d see ourselves \u2014 not ourselves, literally \u2014 but our project on TV every day at lunch \u2026 and not because it was such a success, but because it was in such bad shape for most of that time,\u201d he said.\n\nHe stopped working full-time around Jan. 5 and returned to San Francisco, returning to Google as a privacy engineer.\n\nWith open enrollment\u2019s end March 31, though, a new kind of relief emerged.\n\n\u201cObviously we\u2019re happy with the final score, seven million (enrollments) and change,\u201d Dickerson said. \u201cWhen we started in October, they said 4 million would be a huge success. Nobody thought there was any chance of making the original 7 million target.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re happy about that, but, really, that it\u2019s over \u2014 that\u2019s the important part.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Politics, Politics news, Middletown Politics news, CT Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "title": "Cromwell native part of elite team that fixed ailing Obamacare site", "og": {"url": "http://www.middletownpress.com/government-and-politics/20140407/cromwell-native-part-of-elite-team-that-fixed-ailing-obamacare-site", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.middletownpress.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MI/20140407/NEWS/140409646/AR/0/AR-140409646.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1125px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Cromwell native part of elite team that fixed ailing Obamacare site"}, "twitter": {"domain": "middletownpress.com", "description": "CROMWELL >> Sometimes the biggest solutions come from the smallest places.", "title": "Cromwell native part of elite team that fixed ailing Obamacare site", "url": "http://www.middletownpress.com/government-and-politics/20140407/cromwell-native-part-of-elite-team-that-fixed-ailing-obamacare-site", "image": {"src": "http://www.middletownpress.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/MI/20140407/NEWS/140409646/AR/0/AR-140409646.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@Middletownpress", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id569948531", "iphone": "id520204340", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.middletownpress"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Politics, Politics news, Middletown Politics news, CT Politics news, US Politics news, world Politics news.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "CROMWELL >> Sometimes the biggest solutions come from the smallest places."}, "article_summary": "According to Cromwell High School mathematics teachers O\u2019Rourke and Petrosky, programs Dickerson wrote for their graphing calculators \u2014 which were new to them at the time \u2014 are still being used today.\nThen, in mid-October last year, the government asked Dickerson, along with four others, to determine if the dysfunctional HealthCare.gov site was salvageable.\n\u201cHe went to Washington assuming he was going to be donating his time, but discovered that was not allowed,\u201d she said.\nAccording to his mom, Debora Dickerson, he has always worked hard for the things he\u2019s passionate about.\n\u201cThat kind of mentality obviously has traveled with him through his career.\u201dUnsurprisingly, Dickerson\u2019s knack for programming began at a young age."}
