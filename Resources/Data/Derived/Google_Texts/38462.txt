ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — Running back LeSean McCoy has a new team and a new contract after he and the Buffalo Bills agreed to restructure his previous deal.

McCoy’s agent, Drew Rosenhaus, confirmed in a text to The Associated Press on Sunday that his client has negotiated a new $40 million five-year contract that will make him the NFL’s highest paid running back. McCoy will make $16 million this season and earn a guaranteed $26.5 million.

The agreement was reached five days after the Bills reached a deal to acquire McCoy from the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for linebacker Kiko Alonso.

The trade and McCoy’s new contract won’t take effect until the new NFL season begins on Tuesday.

McCoy had three years left on his previous contract.
