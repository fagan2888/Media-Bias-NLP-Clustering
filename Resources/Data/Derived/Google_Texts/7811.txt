Kohima: The Nagaland Voluntary Consumers' Organisation (NVCO) has welcomed the decision of the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution to implement the National Food Security Act (NFSA) in the state from June 1.NVCO president Kezhokhoto Savi said, "Nagaland is the only state in the country that has not implemented the National Food Security Act, 2013, yet, with the state losing out on a thousand metric tonnes (MT) of food grain allocation."The decision was announced by Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan during his visit to the state last week. The minister directed the state government to put in place a digitized system to check malpractices and inform beneficiaries about the quality and quantity of food items."Isn't the state government embarrassed about not being able to implement an Act that could benefit 47,940 Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY), 77,095 BPL and 59,000 APL cardholders in Nagaland?" Savi said.He recalled that the Nagaland chief minister, TR Zeliang, had emphasized the importance of implementing the NFSA during the fifth session of the 12th Nagaland Legislative Assembly on July 22, 2014. "His decision and justification, which came later, of implementing the NFSA, 2013, only by June or July 2016 in a phased manner was not fair."He said food security simply means availability of adequate food grains at affordable prices.
