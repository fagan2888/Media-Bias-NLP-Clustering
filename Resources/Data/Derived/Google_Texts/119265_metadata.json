The official added, \"It went only to this small group in Pakistan.\" The official said they were written in Urdu, an official language of Pakistan.\n\nThe second official said Malik \"expressed her desire\" in one of the posts to become an Islamic militant in her own right, the Times said. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity, the newspaper said.\n\nU.S. officials have said their investigation has yet to turn up evidence that foreign militants directed Farook or Malik when they stormed a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers and opened fire with assault-style rifles.\n\nThe couple fatally shot 14 people and wounded more than 20 in a rampage the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was treating as an act of terrorism inspired by Islamist militants.\n\nFarook, the U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, a Pakistani native he married last year in Saudi Arabia, were killed in a shootout with police hours after the assault in San Bernardino, 60 miles (100 km) east of Los Angeles.\n\nThe FBI has said the couple declared they were acting on behalf of Islamic State. But FBI Director James Comey has said there was no evidence the militant group was aware of them before the attack.\n\n(Writing by Eric Beech in Washington; Reporting by Mark Hosenball in Washington; Editing by Mary Milliken and Lisa Shumaker)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The messages were posted before Malik, 29, entered the United States on a K-1 fianc\u00e9e", "title": "California shooter messaged Facebook friends about support for jihad: LA Times", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/14/Shooter-messaged-Facebook-friends-about-support-jihad-LA-Times", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/california-shooting_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/12/14/Shooter-messaged-Facebook-friends-about-support-jihad-LA-Times", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/california-shooting_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The messages were posted before Malik, 29, entered the United States on a K-1 fianc\u00e9e", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2215\"", "article_summary": "But FBI Director James Comey has said there was no evidence the militant group was aware of them before the attack.\nThe officials, who declined to be identified by name, would not discuss specific social media monitoring techniques that are being tested.\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times report, one of the officials characterized Malik's messages as \"her private communications ... to a small group of her friends,\" according to the Times.\nJohn Cohen, former acting chief of DHS' intelligence bureau, said civil liberties and privacy concerns have given some DHS officials reservations about scrutinizing visa applicants' social media posts.\nWhile there currently is no explicit order banning visa investigators from trawling applicants' social media accounts, some agencies have been wary about doing so, the official said."}
