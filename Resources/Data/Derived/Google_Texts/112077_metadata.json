But over the 16 years they\u2019ve lived in their home, their garden has gotten bigger, better and more productive.\n\n\u201cWe produce almost more than we can eat,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cAt dinner, we go out and harvest together,\u201d picking tomatoes for bruschetta, greens for salads and smoothies, peppers for their homemade pepper jelly and all the veggies for their favorite soup, a \u201cvelvety\u201d blend of beets, carrots and acorn squash.\n\nJohn and Carrie Duba's acreage on a hill overlooks the Cannon River Valley and includes a patio with pond and two-tiered vegetable garden.\n\nThe Dubas were gardeners before they moved to their current home, but its expansive site allows them to garden on a much larger scale.\n\nThe couple and their three young children were living \u201cin town\u201d when they first looked at the house, with its large, sprawling yard on the outskirts of the city. The 1970s two-story needed a lot of work, but the Dubas could envision its potential to become the family homestead.\n\n\u201cOur friends said, \u2018Run from this house!\u2019 \u201d Carrie recalled. \u201cBut we looked at it and could see grandchildren.\u201d\n\nSo the Dubas bought the house and began the process of making it their own, indoors and out. \u201cThere weren\u2019t any gardens here,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cIt was all grass, and the grass that faced the west was all brown.\u201d\n\nTheir lot\u2019s huge size, about 3 acres, was intimidating at first. \u201cIt felt completely overwhelming,\u201d Carrie said. But one by one, the family started to carve out gardens.\n\n\u201cOur very first bed was a rock garden bed by the driveway,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cThen we did a big hedge bed.\u201d Their first vegetable patch was \u201cvery modest \u2014 a 15-by-15 patch divided into quadrants.\u201d\n\nTheir three children helped. They had to.\n\n\u201cWe forced them to weed,\u201d John said with a laugh. Each child was required to fill a bucket before they could go off and play. And they also had their own plot to tend.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d put seeds in their Easter baskets, and they\u2019d take care of that crop,\u201d Carrie said. Homegrown food was part of daily life. \u201cWhen we\u2019d eat, we\u2019d say, \u2018All of this came from the garden. This was all alive 15 minutes ago.\u2019 \u201d\n\nTheir first compact vegetable garden was \u201cjust right for our young family with small children,\u201d Carrie said.\n\nBut several years later, when their kids were a little older, a tornado struck the area \u2014 creating an opportunity for the Dubas to radically transform their yard.\n\n\u201cWe lost seven trees. Suddenly we were not shaded in front,\u201d Carrie said. They decided to create a bigger, more elaborate vegetable garden, with a patio.\n\n\u201cJohn and I stood on the crest of the hill, where the sun sets,\u201d she said. \u201cWe started talking about what we could do. \u2026 \u2018Let\u2019s make it curved, let\u2019s terrace it. If we cut into the hill, we could have a circular patio.\u2019 \u201d\n\nJohn rented a Bobcat to excavate, and they bought pallets of patio brick \u2014 and learned how to lay it \u2014 creating a two-tiered garden fenced by split rails salvaged from an old fence on the perimeter of the property. Once again, the kids helped.\n\n\u201cOur kids have always been part of the crew,\u201d Carrie said. \u201cThey learned how to do things. Our 24-year-old is helping other people [garden] now.\u201d\n\nWhile everyone in the family has shared garden chores \u2014 from weeding to tomato-sauce processing by assembly line \u2014 the Dubas have a clear division of labor for some roles.\n\nJohn and Carrie Duba\u2019s acreage on a hill overlooks the Cannon River Valley and includes a patio with a pond and raised beds for growing vegetables.

I figure out how to do it,\u201d John said.\n\nCarrie agreed. \u201cI\u2019ll say, \u2018This should be a pond,\u2019 and within two hours, John had dug it out.\u201d\n\nJohn also devised a way to create a juniper arch \u2014 after Carrie pointed out that the two upright junipers flanking their garden path had gotten so tall that they were interrupting the view of the river valley. He climbed a ladder, and Carrie steadied him so he wouldn\u2019t fall while he wired the tree tops together.\n\nMore formal\n\nLast year, the garden underwent yet another transformation after some of the wooden posts from the old split-rail fence started to rot.\n\n\u201cWe did not want to redo them, ever,\u201d John said. So they took down the fence and built eight raised beds out of stone and brick. \u201cNow it\u2019s more of a formal garden,\u201d John said.\n\nWith no fencing to deter deer, the Dubas had to try a different tactic. They installed sprinklers triggered by an infrared motion sensor. \u201cThe deer get spooked,\u201d John said. \u201cWe\u2019re able to keep the critters out without a fence or chemicals.\u201d\n\nNow that the patio and garden are more integrated, the Dubas spend more time relaxing there. \u201cWe definitely use it more now that it\u2019s not fenced off,\u201d John said. \u201cWe sit down there with coffee in the morning or a glass of wine in the evening, looking out to the horizon.\u201d\n\nThe Dubas added raised beds for growing vegetables. Their acreage includes sweeping views of the Cannon River Valley.\n\nIt\u2019s also a good vantage point for viewing the restored prairie area they created in front of their home near the road. \u201cWe just stopped mowing, and planted \u2018meadow in a can,\u2019 \u201d said John, with help from Prairie Restoration and a friend who collected wildflower seeds for them.\n\nThe blooming prairie changes color throughout the seasons, and attracts bees and other beneficial insects. \u201cIt gets dozens of dragonflies \u2014 so many, it looks sparkly in the evening,\u201d Carrie said.\n\nLike many gardens, the Dubas\u2019 remains a work in progress. Carrie still hopes to add a Japanese garden in back. \u201cWe have a perfect spot,\u201d she said. And their teenage daughter, who fell in love with roses while visiting Ecuador, is lobbying for a rose garden.\n\nBut overall, Carrie is pleased with what they\u2019ve created. \u201cWe are kind of thrilled with where we ended up,\u201d she said.\n\nJohn, however, has one complaint: \u201cWe have too many sitting areas \u2014 and not enough sitting.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The ingredients for the homemade hors d'oeuvres and desserts at a Northfield couple's recent cocktail party were locally sourced \u2014 harvested from their vegetable beds, which sit on a picturesque hilltop with a panoramic view overlooking the Cannon River.", "title": "Beautiful Gardens: Edibles take a starring role at a hilltop garden in Northfield", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/beautiful-gardens-edibles-take-a-starring-role-at-a-hilltop-garden-in-northfield/331708701/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144441454735376.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144441454735376.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The ingredients for the homemade hors d'oeuvres and desserts at a Northfield couple's recent cocktail party were locally sourced \u2014 harvested from their vegetable beds, which sit on a picturesque hilltop with a panoramic view overlooking the Cannon River.", "title": "Beautiful Gardens: Edibles take a starring role at a hilltop garden in Northfield", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/beautiful-gardens-edibles-take-a-starring-role-at-a-hilltop-garden-in-northfield/331708701/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144441454735376.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_144441454735376.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The ingredients for the homemade hors d'oeuvres and desserts at a Northfield couple's recent cocktail party were locally sourced \u2014 harvested from their vegetable beds, which sit on a picturesque hilltop with a panoramic view overlooking the Cannon River."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddccc\"", "article_summary": "John and Carrie Duba's acreage on a hill overlooks the Cannon River Valley and includes a patio with pond and two-tiered vegetable garden.\nGallery: John and Carrie Duba's acreage on a hill in Northfield overlooks the Cannon River Valley and includes a patio with pond.\nTheir acreage includes sweeping views of the Cannon River Valley.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s more of a formal garden,\u201d John said.\nThey decided to create a bigger, more elaborate vegetable garden, with a patio."}
