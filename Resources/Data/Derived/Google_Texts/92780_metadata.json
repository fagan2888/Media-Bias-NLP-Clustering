In 2014, pay was increased by 2 percent with a 1 percent increase the year prior.\n\nIn addition to salary increases, funding 124 new positions \u2014 including 94 teachers, 12 bus drivers, 10 paraprofessionals and five assistant principals \u2014 will cost $9.1 million in salaries and benefits.\n\nPay rates for substitute teachers was proposed to increase to $85 across the board from $65 for non-certified subs and $75 for those certified.\n\nEven with these increases, Bearden praised the tentative budget for expecting revenues to exceed expenditures by $10.5 million.\n\nThe budget calls for $345.4 million in revenues, an increase over last year by $36.3 million, while expenditures ($335 million) are expected to increase $22.3 million from 2015.\n\nWith a beginning projected 2016 fund balance, or reserves, of $39.6 million, the balance should grow to $50.1 million by the end of FY16, the first time it will grow in about four years, Bearden said.\n\nThis final number is more than 15 percent of the district\u2019s expected expenditures.\n\nDan Jones, the district\u2019s chief financial officer, said it is the system\u2019s policy to be at or above 15 percent, though it hasn\u2019t been in years. Meeting that threshold will help bond ratings and make funding capital projects cheaper.\n\nPart of the increase in revenue may be attributed to a proposed increase in the millage rate from 16.3 mills to 17.3, an increase that has not happened in four years.\n\nJones said a projected $153.4 million may be the result of the increase \u2014 $23.8 million more than last year \u2013 though the tax digest presented on Thursday will change before being finalized.\n\n\u201cUntil we get a final tax digest, it\u2019s hard to say what the number will be,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI expect [the digest] to go down some, but I don\u2019t know how much yet.\u201d\n\nJones said he has not made calculations yet for what this increase will translate to per average household since the unknowns are still too high.\n\nThe district is hoping added revenues will offset an expected $10 million lost due to austerity reductions.\n\nThis money is lost when the district does not receive the full funding it is supposed to from state QBE earnings, which is based on student enrollment.\n\nSince austerity reductions began in 2003, the school system has added 23,659 students and lost $158 million.\n\nNearly half of the $6 million they are expected to get back from a decrease in these reductions will be spent on funding health care plans for non-certified employees \u2014 bus drivers and cafeteria workers \u2014 no longer covered by the state.\n\nThe board is expected to vote on a tentative budget at its meeting May 21, so it can be advertised before a final decision in June.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.forsythnews.com/archives/27406/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/forsythnews/article/2015/05/18/forsyth-logo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "FORSYTH COUNTY -- Both teacher salaries and Forsyth County school taxes are poised to increase next school year, as the annual budget for 2016 was presented Thursday to the Board of Education.", "title": "Tax hike proposed to cover Forsyth County school system budget"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Tax hike proposed to cover Forsyth County school system budget"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf606\"", "article_summary": "FORSYTH COUNTY -- Both teacher salaries and Forsyth County school taxes are poised to increase next school year, as the annual budget for 2016 was presented Thursday to the Board of Education.\nPart of the increase in revenue may be attributed to a proposed increase in the millage rate from 16.3 mills to 17.3, an increase that has not happened in four years.\nThe budget calls for $345.4 million in revenues, an increase over last year by $36.3 million, while expenditures ($335 million) are expected to increase $22.3 million from 2015.\nSince austerity reductions began in 2003, the school system has added 23,659 students and lost $158 million.\nEven with these increases, Bearden praised the tentative budget for expecting revenues to exceed expenditures by $10.5 million."}
