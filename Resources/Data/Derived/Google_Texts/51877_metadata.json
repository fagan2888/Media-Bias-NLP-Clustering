EPA\n\nFor years, Audi\u2019s sleek sedans have been the hands-down favorite car among Chinese officials and others in China aiming to affect an air of authority. But increasingly China\u2019s leaders seem enamored by Volvo, a car brand known more for family-friendliness than official gravitas.\n\nOn Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping and wife Peng Liyuan stopped by a Volvo car plant during a visit to the Belgian city of Ghent, accompanied by no less than the country\u2019s royals, King Philippe and Queen Mathilde.\n\nThe visit came after Volvo was added last fall to the list of brands eligible for purchase for government use, a market worth $20 billion a year, according to UBS Securities. Meanwhile, other foreign luxury brands \u2014 among them Audi \u2014 have been dropped.\n\nNow it looks as if China\u2019s government\u2019s budding romance with Volvo is continuing to bloom, thanks largely to company chairman Li Shufu\u2019s increasingly cozy relationship with the country\u2019s ruling elite. Mr. Li is a member of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference.\n\nAfter Chinese car company Geely\u2019s 2010 purchase of Volvo from Ford Motor Co., for a while it seemed unclear whether the Chinese government would treat Volvo as a Chinese or foreign brand. Mr. Xi\u2019s factory visit would appear to have set matters straight.\n\nPhotographs from this week\u2019s event suggest Mr. Li stayed close to Mr. Xi\u2019s shoulder, most likely bending his ear on all things auto.\n\nVolvo needs all the help it can get in China, where it is still relatively small player in China\u2019s market for luxury cars. In China, German brands Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz together hold around 70% market share. Still, Volvo\u2019s sales are picking up: In the first quarter of this year, the company sold 17,286 cars in China, up 25% on the same period a year earlier.\n\nGeely and Volvo in China were not immediately available for comment Wednesday.\n\nLast month, during China\u2019s annual parliamentary session, in an interview with China Real Time, Volvo\u2019s Mr. Li outlined areas where he believes China needs to step on the pedal to develop its auto industry, including relaxing caps on foreign investment in car-producing joint ventures.\n\nUnder current regulations, global auto makers can own only as much as half of their joint ventures in China. Most foreign car companies such as General Motors Co. and Ford Motor hold 50% shares. One notable exception is Volkswagen\u2019s joint venture with FAW Group, in which the German automaker holds 40%.\n\n\u201cRather than only imposing limits on shareholdings, China should develop its auto industry in a fair and transparent manner,\u201d Mr. Li said.\n\nBy the same token, CRT wonders if perhaps China\u2019s president should start visiting other Chinese car makers\u2019 plants, too?\n\n\u2013Colum Murphy and Lilian Lin.
