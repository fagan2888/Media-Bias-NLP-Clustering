In America? Not so much.\n\nA girl looks into a KFC restaurant which opened some months ago in Hue city, the old royal capital of Vietnam on Wednesday, April 28, 2010.\n\nHANOI, Vietnam \u2014 Americans weaned on war movies may imagine Vietnam as a dreary place where communist thought reigns supreme.\n\nAn authoritarian communist party controls Vietnam. It\u2019s true. But its founding ideology appears all but gone from the hearts of Vietnam\u2019s people. Vietnam, in fact, may actually be one of the most pro-capitalist countries on Earth.\n\nAlmost all Vietnamese people \u2014 95 percent of them \u2014 now support capitalism, according to the Pew Research Center, which polled nearly 45 nations late last year on economic issues.\n\n\n\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsor\n\nNo other country in the poll cracked 90 percent. Even in the United States \u2014 where \u201csocialist\u201d can be used as an insult \u2014 only 70 percent agreed that a free market economy is the best kind of economy.\n\nThe polls specifically asked citizens if \u201cmost people are better off in a free-market economy even though some people are rich and some are poor.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s capitalism in a nutshell. And yet, according to the poll, one in four Americans disagrees with that statement. In Vietnam, where the ruling party once forced millions onto collective work farms, practically everyone agrees.\n\nWhile a global median of roughly 65 percent feels the same way, Vietnam\u2019s support for capitalism is particularly striking, given its modern history. The nation is synonymous with America\u2019s struggle to vanquish communism and install pro-Western capitalism in Vietnam.\n\nThe conflict cost roughly 2 million lives and reduced Vietnamese cities to smoking rubble. The United States dropped more bombs on the region than it did during all of World War II \u2014 all in the name of halting the spread of Soviet-backed communism across Asia. Despite the brutal effort, the United States lost and Vietnam\u2019s communists prevailed.\n\nOver time, however, their original doctrine of collective labor and total economic dominance by the state has withered \u2014 so much so that almost all Vietnamese (including many within the communist party) now embrace the ideology trumpeted by their former battlefield foe.\n\nThe poll also measured hope for the future, a key ingredient in the so-called \u201cAmerican dream.\u201d But here too the United States is eclipsed by Vietnam, where 94 percent believe children today will be better off than their parents.\n\nAmerica \u2014 where only 30 percent believe today\u2019s kids will be better off \u2014 looks positively gloomy in comparison.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Polls show the 'American Dream' is alive in Hanoi.
