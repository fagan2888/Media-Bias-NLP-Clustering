For those who can\u2019t see outside the box of academia, philosophy can seem impractical.\n\nBut there are numerous examples to the contrary. A recent Forbes article calls philosophy and other liberal arts degrees tech\u2019s hottest ticket, and a 2014 Huffington Post piece argued that a philosophy background is the secret to success in the business world.\n\nBruce Bodaken (\u201873), one of the CSU philosophy department\u2019s most notable alums, recently retired as president, chairman and CEO of health insurance nonprofit Blue Shield of California. His long and successful career was groundbreaking, as he advocated for universal health care in California more than eight years before President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act. Bodaken believes it is his background in philosophy that distinguished him from his peers in business and uniquely prepared him to be a leader and innovator.\n\nA passion for philosophy\n\nBodaken was born and raised in Iowa but chose CSU over universities that were closer to home after his cousin, an alumna, spoke of how much she loved her time here.\n\n\u201cColorado had an interesting flavor to it because it has mountains and things that don\u2019t exist where I grew up, so it was attractive on that front,\u201d he said.\n\nBodaken describes his time at CSU as being a \u201cgreat experience,\u201d especially his involvement in the philosophy department. He discovered his passion for philosophy by chance when he took an introductory course as part of the core curriculum and quickly changed his major.\n\n\u201cI decided that studying philosophy might be interesting,\u201d he explained.\n\nStrong faculty connections\n\nThe College of Liberal Arts is known for its excellent teaching, regularly sweeping the annual Best Teacher awards, and Bodaken names his first philosophy professor as being the spark that ignited his interest in the discipline.\n\n\u201cThe faculty were not only good philosophers, but they were also really great teachers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I happened to get one of those wonderful teachers \u2014 Dave Crocker \u2014 in my first philosophy class. I was excited about the subject matter, and he encouraged me to think about taking more classes, which I did. You can pinpoint people in your career who made a difference, and [Crocker] certainly made a difference in my life.\u201d\n\nIf a skilled professor is what drew him in, it was activism and anti-war politics that kept him engaged. Bodaken fondly recalled the special relationship that students had with faculty at that time.\n\n\u201cIt was a time of political upheaval, and these guys were all very politically active,\u201d he said of his professors. \u201cI was marching with them in the streets some days and taking their courses other days.\u201d\n\nThe skills for success\n\nBodaken continued studying philosophy after he graduated from CSU, earning a master\u2019s degree in philosophy at the University of Colorado and completing Ph.D. coursework before leaving academia for a career in the health insurance industry. Bodaken credits his background in philosophy with helping him hone his business acumen, as he had little experience in the industry.\n\n\u201cPhilosophy gave me a rigor in thinking, writing and logical reasoning that helped me navigate the business world in my early years,\u201d he said. \u201cThose skills directly and indirectly made a big difference for me.\u201d\n\nPhilosophy teaches students how to write, think critically, analyze problems thoroughly and express themselves clearly and persuasively. In the business world, this makes them quick learners and excellent problem-solvers. Bodaken\u2019s skillset in problem-solving set him apart from peers who took a more traditional path to business.\n\n\u201cI was promoted partly because of the way I approached problems,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people around me had MBAs. I used to joke that anyone can learn how to read a balance sheet, but it\u2019s hard to teach strength of leadership and strength of thinking. Philosophy, because of the rigor of the thinking, prepares you for making tough decisions and thinking through complex situations at a very deep level.\u201d\n\nFor Bodaken, this sometimes meant breaking from tradition in favor of pursuing actions more in alignment with his ethical framework. In 2002, he was the first health plan CEO in the U.S. to propose a plan for universal health coverage.\n\n\u201cWe knew it was going to be something of a public relations risk, but [universal health coverage] was clearly aligned with my fundamental values about equity and fairness. We didn\u2019t regret it for a moment, because it was pretty clear that something like this ultimately had to happen. And many of the tenets of that plan are now embodied in the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nGetting back to his roots\n\nNow that he\u2019s retired, Bodaken has returned to his roots in academia, teaching part-time in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley. His courses focus on leadership ethics and health care topics such as universal health coverage \u2014 a unique marriage of his studies in philosophy and experience in health insurance. Bodaken sees this interdisciplinary approach as being important to the future of philosophy.\n\n\u201cNow, especially, it is critical to think about how to round out a philosophy degree with other classes that have an applied component,\u201d he said. \u201cFor example, public health, or politics, or business, or other areas where you\u2019re applying your understanding of philosophical issues.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Philosophy helped shape Bodaken\u2019s career trajectory, and he in turn has given back to the program, returning to campus in October 2014 to speak to a World Philosophies class and meet with department leadership and College of Liberal Arts Dean Ann Gill. Bodaken maintains strong connections to the community through his son, a 2009 alumnus of CSU who lives in Fort Collins with his family. With many more visits to Fort Collins planned for the coming years, Bodaken will remain active in shaping the future of the philosophy department.\n\nThough philosophy may be more challenging than some areas of study, Bodaken explains that the benefits are equally rewarding.\n\n\u201cWhile philosophy is certainly initially difficult, it is well worth it in terms of how you understand the world, how you understand yourself, and how you understand the ways others have thought through the very same issues that are important to you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s intrinsically rewarding, but it can also be extrinsically rewarding and certainly has been for me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "SOURCE", "description": "Bruce Bodaken (\u201873), one of the CSU philosophy department\u2019s most notable alums, recently retired as president, chairman and CEO of health insurance nonprofit Blue Shield of California.", "title": "A business leader with a philosophical mind", "url": "http://source.colostate.edu/a-business-leader-with-a-philosophical-mind/", "image": {"width": 745, "identifier": "http://source.colostate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Bruce-BodakenSquare-e1462221048258.jpg", "height": 745}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-02T20:28:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-02T20:30:57+00:00"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://source.colostate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Bruce-BodakenSquare-e1462221048258.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "In 2002, he was the first health plan CEO in the U.S. to propose a plan for universal health coverage.\nIn the business world, this makes them quick learners and excellent problem-solvers.\nBodaken believes it is his background in philosophy that distinguished him from his peers in business and uniquely prepared him to be a leader and innovator.\n\u201cPhilosophy gave me a rigor in thinking, writing and logical reasoning that helped me navigate the business world in my early years,\u201d he said.\nHis long and successful career was groundbreaking, as he advocated for universal health care in California more than eight years before President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act."}
