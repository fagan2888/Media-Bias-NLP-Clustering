That will have the biggest and most immediate impact for most health organizations. But so would a drastically reduced patient enagagement requirement, and an alignment of hospital reporting to the calendar year.\n\nThe move toward finalization is not a moment too soon.\n\nFor months, healthcare providers and EHR vendors have been clamoring \u2013 \"urging and pleading\" \u2013 for some clarity about what to expect next from the EHR Incentive Program.\n\nJust this week, the Medical Group Management Association put out a press release asking, \"Where is the final rule?\"\n\nBeyond leading to industry confusion, MGMA said the lateness meant its medical group members won't have enough to time to get their houses in order once the final rules do (finally) appear. In their absence, the association called on CMS to extend the 2015 reporting period, calling it \"absolutely vital to continued program success.\"\n\nBeyond the Stage 2 modifications, of course, the industry is also curious to see just how much of the Stage 3 proposed rule ends up in the finalized framework currently being mulled by OMB.\n\nCMS officials say the rule aims at eight \"objectives of advanced use\": data security, e-prescribing, clinical decision support, CPOE, patient access, care coordination, HIE and public health reporting.\n\n\"The goal was to become simpler; to get to something that was sustainable for future achievement,\" said Robert Anthony, deputy director of CMS' quality measurement and health assessment group, speaking at HIMSS15 this spring. \"To focus in areas that were priorities for us as an agency, but also for us as healthcare providers and consumers: promoting health information exchange and focusing on improved outcomes.\"\n\nSee also:\n\nStage 3 meaningful use: What's next?\n\nSenate suggests Stage 3 MU delay\n\nThe good, the bad and the ugly of Stage 3 MU", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has handed the baton to the Office of Management and Budget, as the rules for Stage 3 meaningful use and the modifications to Stage 2 inch closer to finalization.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare IT News", "description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has handed the baton to the Office of Management and Budget, as the rules for Stage 3 meaningful use and the modifications to Stage 2 inch closer to finalization.", "title": "Meaningful use rules in OMB for review", "url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/meaningful-use-rules-omb-review", "image": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/relay_race_handoff_0.png", "updated_time": "2015-09-17T10:44:36-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/meaningful-use-rules-omb-review", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcareitnews.com/sites/default/files/relay_race_handoff_0.png"}, "description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has handed the baton to the Office of Management and Budget, as the rules for Stage 3 meaningful use and the modifications to Stage 2 inch closer to finalization.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Meaningful use rules in OMB for review"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-04T12:52:30-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-17T10:44:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6f55\"", "article_summary": "In their absence, the association called on CMS to extend the 2015 reporting period, calling it \"absolutely vital to continued program success.\"\nThe combined rules were delivered to OMB on September 3, the final step before publication.\nJust this week, the Medical Group Management Association put out a press release asking, \"Where is the final rule?\"\nThe much-requested 90-day 2015 reporting period is included in the Stage 2 modifications.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has handed the baton to the Office of Management and Budget, as the rules for Stage 3 meaningful use and the modifications to Stage 2 inch closer to finalization."}
