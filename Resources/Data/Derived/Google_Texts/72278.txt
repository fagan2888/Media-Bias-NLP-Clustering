For more than a year, gobs of people have urged the Florida Legislature to accept expanded Medicaid money from the feds.

We're talking about hospital execs, health-care experts, advocates for the poor, proponents of the economy, newspaper editorial boards, government watchdogs and more.

Even Gov. Rick Scott and Republicans in the Senate wanted the money, knowing that Florida taxpayers had paid into the system - and that uninsured families needed the coverage. (Scott said he couldn't reject it "in good conscience.")

But no, Republicans in the Florida House wanted to stamp their feet and pound their fists about "Obamacare." So they spent the last session dealing with silly issues, while letting uninsured families suffer ... along with the state's economy. ("Forget Pop-Tarts -- Florida's health, economy need attention.")

Now, however, they may finally do the right thing.

Not because it's the morally right thing to do ... which it is.

Not because it's the financially right thing to do ... which it is.

Legislators may finally do the right thing because their puppet-masters in the Florida Chamber of Commerce seem to be giving them new marching orders. "Florida Chamber of Commerce report backs Medicaid Expansion."

It has been proven time and again that Big Business's desires trump sound policy in the Florida Legislature. We may simply be fortunate that, this time, the two things align.
