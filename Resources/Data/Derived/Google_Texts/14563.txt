A Salt Lake City police officer has been placed on leave after refusing an assignment at a gay pride parade.

“We don’t tolerate bias and bigotry in the department, and assignments are assignments,” department spokeswoman Lara Jones toldNBC’s Salt Lake City affiliate.

The officer was among 30 others assigned to provide traffic control and security Sunday for the annual Utah Pride Parade in Salt Lake City. The spokeswoman would not give the officer’s reason for refusing the assignment.

“We serve a variety of community events with similar functions, and to allow personal opinion to enter into whether an officer will take a post is not something that can be tolerated in a police department,” she told the station.

Internal affairs officers are investigating the officer’s refusal while he is on paid administrative leave.

Utah Pride Center spokeswoman Deann Armes issued a statement Friday thanking the department for its decision.

“Our goal is to make sure that police training and certification includes policies and oaths to ensure that all officers are committed to providing equal service and treatment of all citizens. Clearly, bigotry is alive and well, and our attorney general upholding discrimination by fighting marriage equality is not helping to reduce discrimination by our police officers,” the statement said, NBC reported.
