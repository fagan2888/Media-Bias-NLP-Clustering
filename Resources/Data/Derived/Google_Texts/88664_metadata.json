It could be Nouri al-Maliki\u2019s since he is the country\u2019s strongman and has alienated the minority Sunnis. It could be George W. Bush\u2019s because he started the whole thing off with possibly the stupidest war in history, the Children\u2019s Crusade exempted on account of youth. The one person who is not at fault, we are told over and over again, is the current president of the United States. Like Millard Fillmore, he has kept us out of war.\n\nPresident Obama is hardly the ogre of right-wing invective, and Obamacare will turn out to have been a truly major reform of our creaky health-care system. But the subject of this column is foreign policy, the area where a president\u2019s power is substantially unchecked. He can, as Obama showed by swapping Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl for five Taliban commanders, just ignore the law. The GOP emitted a pro forma wail and then returned to contemplating the meaning of Eric Cantor\u2019s defeat. No one much cared.\n\nOther than avoiding war, it\u2019s hard to know what Obama wants. I know what he says, but actions always speak louder than words. For instance, he wanted Bashar \u00adal-Assad to cease using chemical weapons. His language was strong, nearly warlike: \u201cAssad\u2019s government gassed to death over a thousand people, including hundreds of children. The images from this massacre are sickening: Men, women, children lying in rows, killed by poison gas. Others foaming at the mouth, gasping for breath. A father clutching his dead children, imploring them to get up and walk.\u201d\n\nWhat happened next? Virtually nothing.\n\nAll those poisoned kids were soon forgotten and so, too, were all those people killed in the war, perhaps as many as 200,000. Those of us who advocated more forceful action were denigrated as war lovers who wanted to send in the infantry. (Better boots on the ground than head in the clouds \u2014 but I prefer neither.) Airstrikes and such might not have worked, but doing nothing never does.\n\nMembers of the Iraqi security forces patrol an area near the borders between Karbala Province and Anbar Province, June 16, 2014. (Stringer/Iraq/Reuters)\n\nThis is a serious, depressing discussion. Countless lives have been lost. A civil war that might have been stopped in its tracks was allowed to fester. The Syrian dictatorship survived, and the war has spilled into Iraq. It has the potential to engage the whole Middle East \u2014 Jordan, for sure, and then that tiny nation west of the Jordan River: Israel. The madmen of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria don\u2019t only kill Muslims; they would gladly also drop a bomb on Tel Aviv.\n\nThe United States may now find itself on the side of Iran \u2014 a majority Shiite nation much like Iraq. What could be more preposterous? What could be more ironic? Worse, we could find ourselves engaged in a religious war \u2014 Sunni vs. Shiite. What will our Sunni friends \u2014 the Saudis, for instance \u2014 think of that? Or maybe we should just wash our hands of the whole thing and turn over a hunk of the Middle East with its oil to a terrorist organization \u2014 one that boasts of committing massacres. Oh, what dreams it must have in the desert night.\n\nWilliam Goldman, the screenwriter, is one of my favorite philosophers. \u201cNobody knows anything,\u201d he once wrote. I thought of him when the politically indestructible Cantor got trounced. What happened? Theories galore, but the salient fact is that nobody saw it coming.\n\nIt was the same with the stock market crash of 2008. Everyone had charts and graphs and smiling eminences on CNBC, but \u2014 somehow, I mean somehow \u2014 almost everyone got it wrong. And what about ISIS? How come the administration did not know what was coming? If it did, it sure kept the information close to the vest.\n\nTo balance the Goldman Rule \u2014 call it a hedge \u2014 I invoke one of my own creation: the Rule of the Worse. You thought Cantor was bad? Look who\u2019s coming after. You thought you can\u2019t get more evil than al-Qaeda? Look at who\u2019s pillaging Iraq, a terrorist group that even al-Qaeda can\u2019t stomach.\n\nThe wise president applies both rules. We know so little, but the one thing we do know is that things can get worse. They did in the Middle East, where Obama settled for a victory jog around the political infield after getting Assad to give up most of his chemical weapons. He now must deal with a region that is so much worse than anyone imagined. Where does the fault lie? Where it always has \u2014 where the buck stops.\n\nRead more from Richard Cohen\u2019s archive.\n\nWhose fault is the current debacle in Iraq?
