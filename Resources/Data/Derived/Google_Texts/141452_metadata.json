The Notre Dame biology graduate student was about to embark on a two-month trip to study the spread of disease among baboons. In preparation, Miller, 30, researched long-haul contraceptives and knew an IUD would be perfect. \"When you're living in a remote part of Africa, you don't want to deal with messy periods, losing your pills, or a pregnancy,\" she says. The doc at the campus health center agreed but couldn't write her a prescription because it would violate the Catholic university's religious doctrine. An off-campus doctor gave Miller a 'script for the Mirena IUD, but she has insurance through Notre Dame \u2014 and it won't pay the claim.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nWelcome to the battle over birth control on campus. A key provision of the 2010 Affordable Care Act requires insurance companies to provide contraception for free. Churches are exempt. Faith-based organizations protested that they should be too. So the Obama administration added a buffer: Institutions sign a form certifying their moral objection to birth control, and a third-party insurer covers the cost. Unsatisfied, 68 nonprofits have sued the government, arguing that this regulatory scheme is, as a statement from Notre Dame puts it, \"an infringement on our fundamental right to the free exercise of our faith.\n\nMost Popular\n\nThere are seemingly as many policies on birth control as there are parties involved. Some schools won't cover it at all \u2014 no exceptions. Others, like Notre Dame, dispense it for certain medical conditions but object to it as contraception. (Although Mirena has been shown to lighten periods, Miller was denied. Notre Dame did not respond to requests for comment on her case.) Wheaton College, an evangelical Christian school, opposes certain IUDs and Plan B on the belief \u2014 disputed by physician groups \u2014 that they can result in abortions.\n\nWhen Rachel Field arrived on the New York City campus of Fordham University, she went to the college's clinic for a Depo-Provera shot, which she'd been getting for five years. \"It's the only birth control my body tolerates,\" she says. Even though she's on her parents' insurance, she says a Fordham doctor refused to provide the shot or any other method or help her find a doc who would.\n\nAfter a few months without Depo, Field landed in the ER with ruptured cysts. It turned out she had polycystic ovarian syndrome that her birth control had been suppressing. A representative for Fordham told Cosmopolitan that while the university does not comment on specific cases, it \"takes our students' health-care needs seriously, including conditions that require hormone treatment.\"\n\nIn the aftermath, Field says she gained 50 pounds. \"It was a horrible time,\" she says. \"I had issues with depression because of inconsistent hormones.\" She is part of a group of 50 students protesting Fordham's policies on campus. Despite multiple cease and desist warnings from the dean of students, Field says, \"we're pushing forward. If we don't fight for our rights, they'll take more.\"\n\nNot all coeds share her indignation. \"We support the university in its attempts to defend its understanding of the dignity of human life, and we are pleased that this lawsuit has sparked intense dialogue,\" said senior Kristina Flathers, a vice president of Notre Dame's Right to Life chapter, in a statement. At Wheaton, senior Abigail Reese says, \"women can make the decision to take the pill, but the government shouldn't get involved. It's stifling to a private Christian institution.\"\n\nIn February 2014, Notre Dame was denied an injunction, meaning it must provide birth control or use the opt-out form. Four months later, the Supreme Court ruled that the craft store Hobby Lobby and other private businesses could deny employees BC coverage if it conflicted with the owners' religious beliefs. Encouraged by that, Notre Dame petitioned the court to reconsider its case. Proceedings in a lower court began in March. At press time, a ruling had not been made.\n\nConstitutional law scholars argue the Supreme Court's ultimate decision could have an impact beyond birth control. \"It potentially opens up the possibility for a wide range of religious exemptions to employment and civil rights laws, like equal pay,\" says Theodore Ruger, dean at the University of Pennsylvania Law School.\n\nFor now, it's rumored Notre Dame students get prescriptions by claiming their birth control isn't for controlling birth. Miller couldn't afford the out-of-pocket cost of Mirena \u2014 it can run up to $900 plus the insertion appointment \u2014 so she settled for the pill, which was okayed as a treatment for heavy periods. \"It's ridiculous that you have to exaggerate or leave things out because you want a certain medication,\" she says.\n\nEven students covered by their parents' plans face hurdles. Notre Dame sophomore Grace Watkins cites a common example: \"Say you're not comfortable asking your family doc for BC. On campus, you can't get it without a note about medical reasons, so you go to Planned Parenthood. Students and faculty often protest outside \u2014 I'm scared I'd see someone I know.\" Junior Michelle McCarthy has her mom send her care packages monthly \u2014 with her BC inside \u2014 to avoid the hassle of the health center. \"I could fight it, but this is easier,\" she says.\n\nWhile the Notre Dame community awaits the court's decision, some at religious schools are warning prospective coeds, saying they wish they'd known before enrolling. \"I came to Fordham for a great liberal arts education. I had no idea this was their policy,\" says Field. \"You can't say 'this is a school for everyone' but restrict the basic right of health care.\"\n\nThis article was originally published as \"When Your College Hates the Pill\" in the July 2015 issue of Cosmopolitan.Click here to get the issue in the iTunes store!", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.contenttype": "article", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/24/160x160/square-1434045787-cos070115bodbirthcontrol-001.jpg", "news_keywords": "birth control, college birth control, birth control issues", "title": "What Do You Do When Your College Rejects Birth Control?", "og": {"site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "description": "Health care reform opened up free birth control for all \u2026 until some schools said, hell, no", "title": "What Do You Do When Your College Rejects Birth Control?", "url": "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/news/a41712/colleges-campuses-rejecting-birth-control/", "image": {"url": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/24/1600x800/landscape-1434045787-cos070115bodbirthcontrol-001.jpg", "width": 1600, "identifier": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/24/1600x800/landscape-1434045787-cos070115bodbirthcontrol-001.jpg", "height": 800}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "image": {"src": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/24/1434045787-cos070115bodbirthcontrol-001.jpg"}, "description": "Health care reform opened up free birth control for all \u2026 until some schools said, hell, no", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "What Do You Do When Your College Rejects Birth Control?"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-13T09:00:00-04:00", "sailthru.socialtitle": "What Do You Do When Your College Rejects Birth Control?", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951817550, affiliate-data=pt=305920&ct=OnSiteCosmo&mt=8", "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "auto-publish": "evergreen", "sailthru.tags": "Health & Fitness, Notre Dame,birth control", "keywords": "Notre Dame,birth control", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "section": "Health & Fitness", "published_time": "2015-06-13 01:00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-15 16:19:59"}, "sailthru.image.full": "http://cos.h-cdn.co/assets/15/24/768x384/landscape-1434045787-cos070115bodbirthcontrol-001.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Health care reform opened up free birth control for all \u2026 until some schools said, hell, no"}, "article_summary": "For now, it's rumored Notre Dame students get prescriptions by claiming their birth control isn't for controlling birth.\nIn February 2014, Notre Dame was denied an injunction, meaning it must provide birth control or use the opt-out form.\nSo the Obama administration added a buffer: Institutions sign a form certifying their moral objection to birth control, and a third-party insurer covers the cost.\nMost PopularThere are seemingly as many policies on birth control as there are parties involved.\nConstitutional law scholars argue the Supreme Court's ultimate decision could have an impact beyond birth control."}
