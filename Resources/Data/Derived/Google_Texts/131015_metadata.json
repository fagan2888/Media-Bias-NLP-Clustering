Will you turn a blind eye, or will you fight to stop the torment?\n\nWhat I speak of is not widely known, but it is there just as strongly as the horrors and torture you see more prevalently. At Walmart stores in Wisconsin, Betta fish are being treated in an inhumane way.\n\nOn a recent aquarium blog centered on rescuing Bettas, an active aquarist wrote that when she spoke with a Walmart manager about this issue, she was told they did not have enough time and staff to change the Betta's water. What is confusing is the claim that they don't have time to change the water, but do have resources to color it blue. This unnatural dye infects the insides of a Betta, which can lead to swim bladder infection and kidney failure.\n\nI have rescued two Bettas and one of them, a male, had a severe case of fin rot and velvet. Both are now healthy due to clean water and good food. When I found him, he was in a small plastic container with dark blue water on a tiny shelf. One of the Bettas had already fallen off the shelf, giving it dropsy, a fatal and incurable disease for Bettas.\n\nI implore you, even if every citizen of Wisconsin Rapids purchased one fish, we could make a difference. You can make a difference; you have a purpose, and you are not helpless or alone. Start a petition, write to Walmart, and spread the word. It is hard to see cruelty being done, but it is there and we can't afford to turn away. We are a free country, so let every living creature, big or small, enjoy that freedom too.\n\nNatalie Klumb,\n\nWisconsin Rapids\n\nEditor's note: Walmart did not respond to Daily Tribune Media's request for a response to this letter.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.wisconsinrapidstribune.com/story/opinion/2014/07/10/walmart-cruel-betta-fish/12445043/", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "We can make a difference, change store's behavior toward fish.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Tribune Media", "description": "We can make a difference, change store's behavior toward fish.", "title": "Letter: Walmart is cruel to Betta fish", "url": "http://www.wisconsinrapidstribune.com/story/opinion/2014/07/10/walmart-cruel-betta-fish/12445043/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wisconsinrapidstribune.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "We can make a difference, change store's behavior toward fish.", "title": "Letter: Walmart is cruel to Betta fish", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e5c61f347017abe9ee21b5f063eafdab4fb163dc/c=0-46-480-526&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/WisconsinRapids/2014/07/10/-gpgbrd06-30-2013gazette1d00620130628imgfishely.jpg.jpg11724got.jpg", "creator": "@wrtribune", "site": "@wrtribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=885558265", "fb": {"app_id": 132335483492709}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "article_summary": "At Walmart stores in Wisconsin, Betta fish are being treated in an inhumane way.\nBuy Photo Betta fish need clean water and can be poisoned by water dye used by some retailers.\nNatalie Klumb,Wisconsin RapidsEditor's note: Walmart did not respond to Daily Tribune Media's request for a response to this letter.\nThis unnatural dye infects the insides of a Betta, which can lead to swim bladder infection and kidney failure.\nI implore you, even if every citizen of Wisconsin Rapids purchased one fish, we could make a difference."}
