And every one of them is a disaster for conservatives.\n\nThough, I should start by defining my terms, since \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201cRepublican\u201d no longer really have any useful ideological meaning. When I say \u201cconservatives,\u201d I\u2019m not only talking about elites who throw around polysyllabic words like \u201cinsalubrious\u201d or oppose the mass deportations of illegal immigrants. I\u2019m describing someone who broadly supports a Goldwater/Reagan vision of economic, regulatory and foreign policy. This includes some \u201cestablishment\u201d types \u2014 who deserve much of the blame and all of the unpleasant fallout \u2014 and many who are legitimately interested in furthering conservative ideals.\n\nAnd when I refer to \u201cTrumpkins,\u201d I\u2019m speaking about people who, whether they explicitly say so or not, view contemporary conservatism as a dead end. Either it\u2019s because they\u2019ve become frustrated by the perceived (and sometimes real) failures of its philosophy and politics, or because they\u2019ve never really been enthralled with those ideas in the first place. Their instincts are nationalistic and protectionist, and their anxiety is primarily fueled by illegal immigration and trade.\n\nPhyllis Schlafly, one-time proponent of limited-government, distilled Trump\u2019s paleo-appeal like so: \u201cIf we don\u2019t stop immigration \u2014 this torrent of immigrants coming in \u2014 we\u2019re not going to be America anymore\u2026\u201d Who cares about low marginal tax rates if some freedom-hating foreigner is taking your job?\n\nTrumpkins will not be placated. Not if they lose, and definitely not if they win. These people will not be placated. Not if they lose, and definitely not if they win. Unless unforeseen events alter the dynamics of American politics, it\u2019s difficult to imagine conventional Republicans and Trumpkins inhabiting the same space after this is all done.\n\nI look forward to loathing three major political parties.\n\nNow, if Trump prevails in the primaries, principled small-government conservatives (however many are left) will be faced with a distasteful choice: they can either back the nominee, picked fairly by the rank-and-file of the party, or they can disregard party politics and actively try and sink him.\n\nSupport Trump? A Disaster Those who decide to endorse Trump because of partisan loyalty will also be supporting a 45-percent tariff on Chinese goods, policies barring immigrants based purely on religion, and whatever other half-baked policy ideas spring from Trump\u2019s mind. And they should be really comfortable with Trumpism (and with that his many liberal positions) because they\u2019ll be spending the rest of their careers justifying the support. For those who think they can embrace neutrality to escape this fight, their silence will be treated as tacit endorsement by liberals and treachery by Trump\u2019s fans. It\u2019s conceivable that a number of local races will suffer in these intraparty skirmishes, hurting conservatives in state races and probably Congress.\n\nMore distressingly, at least for some of us, is the prospect that Trump\u2019s outlook will turn out to be more popular than anyone imagines. Maybe a flood of candidates will begin aping his populism and succeed. Maybe Trump begins to transform American discourse into something more closely resembling European politics, where nationalists and socialists argue about who should run the state apparatus.\n\nFight Trump? A Disaster For those who decide to actively oppose Trump \u2014 and you assume many factions on the Right would \u2014 the prospects are not much better. There\u2019s no modern precedent for a party\u2019s establishment undercutting its nominee, so it\u2019s improbable the Republican Party would participate in torpedoing Trump. The time for that has passed. (One day perhaps, Reince Priebus will explain how he let a populist liberal reality-show host win a major party\u2019s nomination.)\n\nMany conservatives will undoubtedly toy with the idea of running a third-party candidate (not as easy as it sounds, when you consider the logistics and the factional nature of Republicans today), which would likely only exist to spoil the GOP nominee\u2019s prospects and challenge his risible claim to conservatism.\n\nThe important question for conservatives is: Would they rather a have Republican president with views antithetical to their own or Hillary Clinton as president? Would they rather have a Republican who may cause irreparably damage to their brand, or Bernie Sanders? Would they want a GOP monopoly in D.C., led by Trump, or continue with gridlock as the purer opposition party? Though, you imagine that helping put Hillary (or Bernie) in the White House would blow up any hope of a healthy right-of-center consensus for many years to come.\n\nIf Trump Loses? A Disaster If conservative intellectuals and many of their institutions and leaders fail to back the nominee, Trump\u2019s fans will hold those elites culpable for the loss, further feeding the frustrations that had alienated them in the first place. The idea that a bunch of know-it-alls can undermine the democratic process will only generate more anger and paranoia. Do Trump boosters seem like the sort of group that will embrace rapprochement and constructive change after having an election stolen from them?\n\nIf Trump Wins? A Disaster Even more terrifying for so many of us is the prospect of a successful Trump presidency. Even without Congress, as Obama has shown, a president can accomplish many destructive things. Though probably not enough to satisfy Trumpkins, who will undoubtedly be disappointed. Presidents can\u2019t just slap huge tariffs on other countries without Congress, and they can\u2019t make Mexico pay for border fences, nor take oil from countries in the Middle East, nor will he be able to deport 13 million illegal immigrants. When this becomes a reality, I suspect his fans will still blame the establishment for its lack of willpower, support, and patriotism.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Wed, 27 Jan 2016 08:34:35 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "There are a number of potential scenarios that may unfold if Donald Trump wins the GOP nomination.
