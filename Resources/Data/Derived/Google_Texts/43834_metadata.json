Publishers said it will highlight the family\u2019s core values of \u201cfaith, family, fellowship, forgiveness and freedom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are honored and excited to be working with Phil and Al Robertson on this new Bible,\u201d said Robert Sanford, Vice President and Associate Publisher for Thomas Nelson\u2019s Bible Group, said in a statement. \u201cThe Robertson family\u2019s passion for the Word is infectious and the impact of their ministry is amazing. We see this Bible as being something people can grow with in their own personal walk with God.\u201d\n\nThe Duck Dynasty bible seems to indicate that the controversy surrounding comments made by Phil Robertson are not having a lasting effect on the Robertson family brand. Despite a dip in ratings the show remains one of the most watched on cable, and its stars remain both marketable and popular, especially in conservative circles.\n\nPhil Robertson himself recently spoke at the Republican Leadership Conference in New Orleans, referring to statements from the White House as \u201cevil\u201d and imploring Republicans to \u201cget Godly.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be right for America if you\u2019re wrong with God,\u201d Robertson said.\u201cIf you want to turn the Republican party around, get godly,\u201d he told an approving crowd.\n\nSpeaking about President Obama, Robertson said \u201cWe\u2019re up against evil like I\u2019ve never seen in my life. I\u2019m sitting here and I\u2019m thinking, \u2018What\u2019s coming out of the White House?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing I can tell you folks is it\u2019s downright embarrassing.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s upcoming Bible may revive some of the controversy from earlier this year. Phil Robertson has come under fire for his interpretation of the scriptures after paraphrasing Paul\u2019s letter to the Corinthians to condemn homosexuality and gay marriage.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers\u2014they won\u2019t inherit the kingdom of God,\u201d Robertson said, quoting a section of the book that has been hotly debated by Bible scholars.\n\nThe Duck Dynasty bible will be released in October.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Duck Dynasty bible is on the way thanks to television's Robertson family.
