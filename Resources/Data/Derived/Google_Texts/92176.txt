REP. NANCY PELOSI: I am very proud about my state of California, where it's going great, and most of the states that have their state-run exchanges, it's all going positively well. There's no question that whatâ€™s happening with the systems, the national plans is something that has to be improved. They were overwhelmed by the traffic. Okay, but now letâ€™s see how long itâ€™s going to take to have that be fixed. But, that's about the technology -- about the benefits, about the liberation of people to a healthier life of liberty, freedom to choose their happiness, that all remains.



I hope that we would have some answers soon and that the answer will be, okay, we've found the glitch or whatever it is, it has been corrected and hereâ€™s a demonstration of how people, when they approach it now, will be received.
