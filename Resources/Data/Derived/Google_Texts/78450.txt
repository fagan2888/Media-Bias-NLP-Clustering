Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro says “Hispanics have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act” and the reason that Clinton has “strong” support in the Hispanic community is because she has a “long track record of supporting the issues that Hispanics… care about.” (RELATED: Hispanics Wouldn’t Vote GOP If You Held A Gun To Their Heads)

Appearing on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports” Thursday, Castro told guest host Peter Alexander that despite the fact Marco Rubio is running for president for the Republicans “the challenge that the Republicans have is not really about personality. They have the personality, they have the folks that will go out there and say a few words in Spanish. Their problem is the policy and that’s a very big problem for them in this cycle.”

Castro criticized the Republican candidates for “scapegoating immigrants” and being “folks who don’t support comprehensive immigration reform, don’t support a pathway to citizenship, would repeal the Affordable Care Act when Hispanics have been among the biggest beneficiaries of the Affordable Care Act.”

Castro argued “don’t believe in making the right investments so that folks who may not have a lot now but that are hard-working, folks of modest means, can get into the middle class.”

Alexander later asked Castro about the possibility of a Clinton/Castro ticket and he initially said “I doubt that’s going to happen.” However, Castro later suggested, “You know, I learned a long time in life that the number one way to ensure that you have a good future is to do a great job with what’s in front of you and not to forget about that.”
