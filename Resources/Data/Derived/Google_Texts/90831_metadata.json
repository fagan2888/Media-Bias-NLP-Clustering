Mrs. Clinton stepped down in early 2013 and is now considered a top potential presidential candidate for 2016, though she has declined to yet say whether she is running.\n\nEarlier this month, Iran and six world powers, including the U.S., agreed to extend negotiations over Tehran\u2019s nuclear-enrichment program for four more months to reach a comprehensive deal.\n\nIran agreed to take further measures to curtail the most advanced parts of its nuclear program. It will accelerate the conversion of its 20% enriched uranium into fuel for its research reactor, U.S. officials said. That move will make the material significantly harder to reconvert into a form that can be used for a nuclear weapon, they said.\n\n\u2014Lawrence Norman contributed to this article.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday that any Iranian uranium enrichment could trigger a nuclear-arms race in the Middle East.", "title": "Clinton: Any Enrichment by Iran Could Trigger Arms Race", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/07/27/clinton-any-enrichment-by-iran-could-trigger-arms-race/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJPolitics", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Politics", "article.headline": "Clinton: Any Enrichment by Iran Could Trigger Arms Race", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday that any Iranian uranium enrichment could trigger a nuclear-arms race in the Middle East.", "article_section": "Politics", "author": "Amy Harder", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Washington Wire Blog", "page.subsection": "Washington Wire", "article.summary": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday that any Iranian uranium enrichment could trigger a nuclear-arms race in the Middle East.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-07-27T15:31:14-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/07/27/clinton-any-enrichment-by-iran-could-trigger-arms-race/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-WB-47821", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Politics", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday that any Iranian uranium enrichment could trigger a nuclear-arms race in the Middle East.", "title": "Clinton: Any Enrichment by Iran Could Trigger Arms Race", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2014/07/27/clinton-any-enrichment-by-iran-could-trigger-arms-race/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Washington Wire", "article.id": "BL-WB-47821", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-07-27T15:31:44-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0908\"", "article_summary": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday that any Iranian uranium enrichment could trigger a nuclear-arms race in the Middle East.\nAs secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton led the Obama administration\u2019s efforts to get international sanctions imposed on Iran, including its oil sector, in 2012.\nIran agreed to take further measures to curtail the most advanced parts of its nuclear program.\n\u201cI believe strongly that it\u2019s really important for there to be so little enrichment or no enrichment at least for a long period of time because I do think any enrichment will trigger an arms race in the Middle East,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said on CNN in an interview with Fareed Zakaria.\nMrs. Clinton stepped down in early 2013 and is now considered a top potential presidential candidate for 2016, though she has declined to yet say whether she is running."}
