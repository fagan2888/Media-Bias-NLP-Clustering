The Duchess of Cambridge recorded this two-minute clip for Place2Be, a national charity providing emotional support to children in schools. Middleton hopes that by calling attention to issues children face at school and at home we will soon be able to lift the stigma surrounding the mental health of children.\n\n\"Place2Be is hugely honoured that The Duchess of Cambridge is our Royal Patron,\" the charity said in a statement. \"This is a tremendous endorsement of the tireless work and commitment of our staff, volunteer counsellors, and supporters, as well as of the partner schools with whom we work to help troubled children to overcome emotionally difficult times in their lives.\"\n\nPlace2Be started with five schools in London and has currently grown to 235 schools nationwide. In the clip, Middleton highlights some of the issues children are forced to deal with, such as bullying domestic violence, and family breakdowns, and how they can lead to serious health complications, including anxiety, depression, addiction, and self-harm. Middleton, already a mother-of-one with another on the way, can most certainly speak to the importance of childhood mental health awareness.\n\n\"The Duchess' support will help Place2Be hugely in its efforts to shine the spotlight on child mental health, and on the need to tackle these issues at the earliest possible stage, so that children have the brightest possible futures, as they deserve,\u201d Place2Be added. \u201cBy helping to raise awareness of Place2Be's early intervention work in schools, the Duchess will also help the charity to reach even more of the UK's most vulnerable children and their families who so desperately need support.\"", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "kate, middleton, shows, support, childrens, mental, health, week, her, second, psa", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Kate Middleton calls attention to Children's Mental Health Week in new two-minute PSA.", "title": "Kate Middleton Supports Children's Mental Health Week In PSA [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/kate-middleton-shows-support-childrens-mental-health-week-her-second-psa-322462", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/02/17/kate-middleton-shows-support-childrens-mental-health-week-her-second-psa.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kate Middleton calls attention to Children's Mental Health Week in new two-minute PSA.", "title": "Kate Middleton Supports Children's Mental Health Week In PSA [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/kate-middleton-shows-support-childrens-mental-health-week-her-second-psa-322462", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/02/17/kate-middleton-shows-support-childrens-mental-health-week-her-second-psa.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/17/kate-middleton-shows-support-childrens-mental-health-week-her-second-psa.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-02-17T12:34:42-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-17T12:34:40-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Kate Middleton calls attention to Children's Mental Health Week in new two-minute PSA."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca18c\"", "article_summary": "Middleton, already a mother-of-one with another on the way, can most certainly speak to the importance of childhood mental health awareness.\nWith the UK kicking off its inaugural Children\u2019s Mental Health Week, people all around the country are standing up in support of children everywhere \u2014 even Kate Middleton and her husband, Prince William.\nMiddleton hopes that by calling attention to issues children face at school and at home we will soon be able to lift the stigma surrounding the mental health of children.\nThe Duchess of Cambridge recorded this two-minute clip for Place2Be, a national charity providing emotional support to children in schools.\n\"Place2Be is hugely honoured that The Duchess of Cambridge is our Royal Patron,\" the charity said in a statement."}
