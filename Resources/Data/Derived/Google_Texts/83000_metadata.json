William Keating, D-Mass.\n\nAlliegro must win the Sept. 9 closed primary, in which only independents and registered Republicans may vote, to run against Keating in the Nov. 4 general election. If he wins the primary, he will likely face an uphill battle against Keating, who was elected to his first term in 2012 by a margin of 25 percentage points.\n\nDenouncing the \u201chuge, bloated and intrusive reach that the federal government has on our daily lives,\u201d Alliegro said he believes in downsizing inefficient bureaucracy.\n\nThe United States has strayed from its \u201cconstitutional form of government,\u201d Alliegro said, adding that restoring the government\u2019s constitutional basis ranks atop his list of priorities and would solve many issues facing the American public.\n\nA history buff, Alliegro said he consistently refers back to the Founding Fathers and others who had a profound impact on shaping the country. \u201cAbraham Lincoln once said, \u2018We are the rightful masters of our Congress and courts,\u2019 but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case these days,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to forget that the United States is not just a land mass \u2014 it\u2019s an idea, a destination and a land of laws created by some genius founding doctrines,\u201d Alliegro added. By significantly altering the country\u2019s guiding ideology, as he said the federal government has done recently, \u201cyou\u2019ve erased the United States. What you have is just any other country in the world.\u201d\n\nTouting himself as a proponent of small businesses, Alliegro said he believes the federal government has gone \u201cway overboard and created a sea of red tape\u201d that is a \u201cprohibitive damper of growth.\u201d Excessive regulation imposes overly burdensome costs on small businesses, he said.\n\nAlliegro said he strongly opposes the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, arguing that the law has failed to insure the estimated 30-50 million uninsured people in the United States and to reduce medical costs. The Affordable Care Act\u2019s reliance on youth participation is a key weakness of the law, Alliegro said, adding that enrollment for this demographic has fallen short of expectations.\n\n\u201cThe idea that we\u2019re going to reduce the cost of medical care always is and always was a sham,\u201d he said. Premiums have increased and are projected to keep rising, and PolitiFact ranked the White House\u2019s promise that people would be able to keep their current health plans as the 2013 \u201cLie of the Year\u201d in December, he said.\n\nAs a Massachusetts resident, Alliegro said, he has seen the \u201clittle model version\u201d of the Affordable Care Act in effect. Since Massachusetts enacted its health care reform law in 2006, the state has had the most expensive health premiums in the nation, he said. Though Massachusetts does not rank first in every health spending category, the state tops the nation in many cost measures, according to multiple reports.\n\nThough Alliegro has public service experience serving as a Falmouth Town Meeting member, he has not worked extensively in politics or law. But being a legislator \u201cdoesn\u2019t require that you be a lawyer,\u201d he said.\n\nAlliegro said he likes to \u201chail back to the old model that this country was created out of citizen representatives,\u201d referring to John Adams, Patrick Henry and Davey Crockett. \u201cWhen they had to go to Congress, they dropped their hunting muskets and their hoes and their quill pens and got on their horses and rode to Philadelphia, or later Washington, and they did their people\u2019s business,\u201d he said.\n\nBut \u201ca class of political elites\u201d now dominates Washington, he said.\n\nRepresentatives are \u201cdetached from reality and the people they are supposed to represent,\u201d Alliegro said. \u201cWe need to turn D.C. back over to the citizens.\u201d\n\nAlliegro said he believes his career in the biological sciences would help him apply an objective, analytical mindset to the task of evaluating legislation.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a difference what your vocation is. What you need is life experience, and I\u2019m no spring chicken,\u201d he said.\n\nMichael Chapman \u201984, who has worked with Alliegro as a visiting scientist in his lab at the Marine Biological Laboratory, praised his colleague\u2019s potential ability to transfer medical experience into Capitol Hill service. \u201cAs a legislator, he would never put party politics above doing the right thing,\u201d he said.\n\nBut before he books his ticket to Washington or even advances to the general election, Alliegro must face several Republicans with more political experience. John Chapman, a former White House aide under President Reagan and the state industrial accidents commissioner for former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, launched his campaign for the seat last month. Alliegro will also be up against Plymouth County GOP Chair Vincent Cogliano Jr. and attorney Dan Shores in the Republican primary.\n\nAlliegro said he is \u201cnot focused on other candidates,\u201d but instead on his own campaign, highlighting his strong staff and the support he has already garnered. \u201cI\u2019m what a lot of people would call a small fish,\u201d he said, acknowledging his outsider status. But \u201cour professional and powerful team is pushing us to the forefront of this campaign,\u201d he said.\n\nSince Alliegro filed a declaration of candidacy in October, his campaign has raised just over $13,500, according to the Federal Election Commission, only about $500 of which is made up of loans.\n\nBut Alliegro has significantly less cash on hand than Chapman, who has $105,802 on hand compared to Alliegro\u2019s $11,986, according to FEC filings.\n\nKeating\u2019s campaign declined to comment.\n\nIf Alliegro does not win the election, he will teach a course at Brown in spring 2015, he said.\n\nDue to an editing error, a previous version of this article incorrectly stated that John Chapman had raised $105,802, significantly more than Mark Alliegro. Though Chapman\u2019s campaign has that amount of cash on hand, he lent the majority of it from his personal savings and has raised slightly under $6,000, less than Alliegro. The Herald regrets the error.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Brown Daily Herald", "description": "Mark Alliegro, professor of molecular biology, cell biology and biochemistry, announced his candidacy for Massachusetts\u2019 9th congressional district.", "title": "Prof. vies for Congressional seat", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/wp-content/themes/browndailyherald/images/facebook-default.png", "updated_time": "2014-02-12T11:54:13+00:00", "url": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/02/12/prof-vies-congressional-seat/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "University News", "published_time": "2014-02-12T01:42:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-12T11:54:13+00:00"}, "description": "Mark Alliegro, professor of molecular biology, cell biology and biochemistry, announced his candidacy for Massachusetts\u2019 9th congressional district.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Emma Harris"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd3cd\"", "article_summary": "Mark Alliegro, professor of molecular biology, cell biology and biochemistry, hopes to win a seat in Massachusetts\u2019 9th congressional district.\nBy significantly altering the country\u2019s guiding ideology, as he said the federal government has done recently, \u201cyou\u2019ve erased the United States.\nSince Massachusetts enacted its health care reform law in 2006, the state has had the most expensive health premiums in the nation, he said.\nAs a Massachusetts resident, Alliegro said, he has seen the \u201clittle model version\u201d of the Affordable Care Act in effect.\nThe Affordable Care Act\u2019s reliance on youth participation is a key weakness of the law, Alliegro said, adding that enrollment for this demographic has fallen short of expectations."}
