Aetna Inc. (NYSE:AET) and Centene Corp. (NYSE:CNC) released fourth-quarter earnings announcements today, and they increased the amount of public information about the effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) a smidgen.

UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH) kicked off earnings season by noting that it still expects to get a profit margin of about 1 percent to 2 percent from its exchange qualified health plan (QHP) business, without use of the complicated, mysterious PPACA "three R's" risk-management programs.
