They also generate a large percentage of inpatient admissions, a major source of hospital revenue. When run well, with a stable group of providers who deliver high quality care and excellent customer service, an ED can make a hospital\u2019s reputation and boost its revenue. But if an ED is inefficient, with poor customer service, patients will be dissatisfied\u2014regardless of the quality of care they receive. Positive or negative, a patient\u2019s experience in the ED triggers a ripple effect that can be felt hospital-wide.I think everyone in healthcare agrees that physician performance drives the patient experience. But what I think many overlook is the support physicians require to perform well\u2014efficiently, compassionately, and consistently. Education and incentives are a great start. But a high-functioning practice environment, which is to say, one where operations, finances, and the team are stable and not a source of stress, is vital. So too is work-life balance and outstanding clinical leadership. You can\u2019t have happy patients if you have miserable doctors. And you won\u2019t ever have happy doctors unless you create an environment where they feel valued, supported, and can thrive.Because of the growth, one of the biggest challenges new and established urgent care centers face is the ever-increasing competition. A location near a hospital or in a commercial area with 25,000 cars passing by is ideal\u2014but it\u2019s likely a competitor will agree. Many assume increasing volume is the way to survive and thrive. But I\u2019d argue that mastering economies of scale and implementing lean processes must be done first.So, cross-train staff to step into each other\u2019s jobs as needed to maintain flexibility and flow. Keep costs lower by staffing only one shift initially\u2014ideally 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. Utilize advanced practice professionals and other support staff to ensure good customer service and flow without overwhelming your existing physician\u2014or adding another. The goal is to maximize your capacity without compromising patient safety or satisfaction, then marketing to increase volume and adding resources when volume truly permits.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "dotmed.com", "description": "Providing smart care in an evolving health system", "title": "Q&A with Dr. Derik K.
