WASHINGTON — Hoosiers have not enjoyed the slowdown in health insurance premiums seen in most states in recent years, concludes a new report examining the cost of employer-provided coverage.

While premiums grew more slowly in 30 states between 2010 and 2013, annual growth remained high in Indiana and nine other states, according to a report from the Commonwealth Fund, a New York foundation that studies health care.

Premiums for a single person rose an average of 6.7 percent annually in Indiana, compared with a 4.1 percent average annual increase nationwide. The increase in Indiana was greater than the 5.3 percent average annual growth from 2003 to 2010, while some states saw declines of 3 percentage points or more.

But even in states where premiums have risen less since passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, premiums have continued to grow faster than income.

"Workers and their families are not yet seeing the benefit from these changes, as most of the benefit of reduced premium growth is accruing to employers," said Commonwealth Fund President David Blumenthal. "So costs continue to grow for workers and families."

About six in 10 Hoosiers under age 65 get health insurance through an employer, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Cathy Shoen, lead author of the Commonwealth report, said the study doesn't explain why costs haven't slowed in Indiana because there are multiple factors that can contribute to premium costs. Those include how much health-care providers in a state are increasing costs, and how much employers are reducing premiums by cutting benefits or by increasing deductibles and other cost-sharing measures.

The reasons why health-care costs have grown more slowly nationally in recent years have also been debated. Some of the reduction is attributed to slower growth in how much providers charge and a decrease in the use of services "both potentially caused by the recession. Increases in deductibles and other cost-sharing measures can also reduce premiums. And the Obama administration has taken credit for parts of the Affordable Care Act intended to reduce costs, such as limits on how much insurers can collect for premiums that aren't spent on health care costs and penalties for hospitals with high readmission rates.

But the average $6,099 premium cost for an employer-provided plan for a single person in Indiana in 2013 was the seventh-highest in the nation.

By contrast, however, the $15,724 average premium for a family plan in Indiana was below the national average of $16,029.

But while the amount of that premium that the employee is expected to cover grew from 25 percent to 27 percent for a family plan in Indiana over the past decade, it shrank from 21 percent to 19 percent for a single person.

The out-of-pocket costs for both, however, continue to grow.

The average amount of the premium that the employee was responsible for in Indiana in 2013 was $1,134 for a single plan, compared with $732 in 2003. Hoosiers with a family plan paid an average $4,300 of the premium cost, up from $2,301 in 2003.

"In most states, the employee share of a family premium is double what it was at the start of the decade," Shoen said.

Deductibles have also increased, from $569 for a single plan in Indiana in 2003 to $1,274 in 2013.

When the employee's share of the premium and deductible are combined, it represents almost 10 percent of the median household income for working-age households in Indiana. That's close to the national average.

"All states have lost ground from an employee perspective," Shoen said.
