Robert Hurt (R-VA), announced last week that he is retiring from Congress when his term ends in 2016.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn addition to his weekly \u201cNuclear Option\u201d column for Breitbart News, Hurt is a Fox News contributor who is the former Washington editor of the New York Post. His columns have resonated with Breitbart News readers because they often take on the GOP establishment and the cronyism associated with Washington\u2019s bipartisan permanent political class.\n\nRobert Hurt reportedly decided to retire because \u201che had come to loathe the political process of Washington.\u201d\n\nRobert Hurt defeated Rep. Tom Perriello (D-VA), who got elected along with Obama in 2008, in 2010 in a race that signified how unpopular President Barack Obama\u2014and his liberal policies like Obamacare and cap and trade\u2014was. Despite having barely won his election in a Republican-leaning district after a recount in 2008, Perriello veered to the left and embraced Obama\u2019s agenda, voting for Obamacare and cap and trade. And that gave Robert Hurt all the ammunition he needed to oust Perriello. Obama campaigned for Perriello in the last days of the election to no avail.\n\nAs the Richmond Times-Dispatch noted, Robert Hurt, 46, is \u201ca married father of three teenagers\u201d and \u201ca lawyer and former member of the Chatham Town Council. He served in the House of Delegates from 2002 to 2007 and in the state Senate from 2008 to 2011.\u201d\n\nFormer Del. Clarke Hogan and NASCAR driver Jeff Burton may also reportedly run for the 5th District seat.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Drudge Report editor, Breitbart News contributor, and Washington Times columnist Charles Hurt is a potential candidate for Congress in Virginia\u2019s 5th District", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Drudge Report editor, Breitbart News contributor, and Washington Times columnist Charles Hurt is a potential candidate for Congress in Virginia\u2019s 5th District", "title": "Report: Drudge Report Editor, Breitbart Contributor Charles Hurt Touted for Congressional Seat - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Hurt-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 356}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/12/29/report-drudge-report-editor-breitbart-contributor-charles-hurt-touted-for-congressional-seat/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Drudge Report editor, Breitbart News contributor, and Washington Times columnist Charles Hurt is a potential candidate for Congress in Virginia\u2019s 5th District", "title": "Report: Drudge Report Editor, Breitbart Contributor Charles Hurt Touted for Congressional Seat - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/Hurt-Thumbnail.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Charles Hurt, Drudge Report, Robert Hurt, virginia,Big Government,Hurt", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "virginia", "published_time": "2015-12-29T15:21:34-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Hurt\u2019s brother, Rep.
