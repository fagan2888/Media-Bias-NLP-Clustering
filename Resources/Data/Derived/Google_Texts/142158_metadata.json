Jeb Bush condemned the Obama administration\u2019s use of \u201ccoercive federal power\u201d to limit religious freedom as he courted Christian conservatives at a Liberty University commencement Saturday ahead of a likely presidential run.\n\nCharging that \u201cthe Christian voice\u201d isn\u2019t heard enough in the world, the Republican White House prospect lashed out at the Democratic president\u2019s administration for \u201cdemanding obedience in complete disregard of religious conscience.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe present administration is supporting the use of coercive federal power. What should be easy calls in favor of religious freedom have instead become an aggressive stance against it,\u201d Bush told an estimated 34,000 gathered for a graduation ceremony.\n\n\u201cSomebody here is being small-minded and intolerant, and it sure isn\u2019t the nuns, ministers, and laymen and women who ask only to live and practice their faith,\u201d he said. Bush spoke inside a packed football stadium at Liberty University, an institution founded by the late conservative culture warrior, Rev. Jerry Falwell.\n\nRelated: Commencement speakers at Catholic colleges this spring\n\nBush, a converted Catholic, is preparing to enter a Republican primary contest that includes Republican competitors considered far more popular with the GOP\u2019s religious right. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz formally announced his presidential campaign at Liberty University last month. Former Arkansas governor and Baptist pastor Mike Huckabee, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry have all made their Christian faith a centerpiece of prospective campaigns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll have aggressively condemned Obama\u2019s health care overhaul, which requires some religion-affiliated organizations to provide health insurance for employees that includes birth control. The measure is among several examples of what Republicans charge is Obama\u2019s attack on religious liberty.\n\n\u201cHow strange, in our own time, to hear Christianity spoken of as some sort of backward and oppressive force,\u201d Bush said. \u201cYour generation is bringing the Christian voice to where it always is needed, and sometimes isn\u2019t heard enough.\u201d\n\nDespite nagging questions about Bush\u2019s conservative credentials, Liberty University president Jerry Falwell Jr. noted that Bush was considered a hero among social conservatives as Florida governor. He fought to keep Michael Schiavo from removing the feeding tube from his brain-damaged wife, Terri. Leaders in the anti-abortion movement still praise Bush today.\n\nAnd in a reminder that his path to the presidency depends upon moderate and independents perhaps as much as conservatives, Bush concluded his remarks with a message for non-Christians.\n\n\u201cIn my experience, at least, you generally find the same good instincts, fair-mindedness, and easygoing spirit among Americans of every type \u2014 including, of course, the many who belong to no church at all,\u201d he said.\n\nDemocrats were paying close attention to Bush\u2019s remarks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cJeb Bush will not win over any Virginia voters with his close-minded pandering to the right wing,\u201d said Morgan Finkelstein, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Virginia. \u201cBy supporting the Indiana discrimination law and attacking women\u2019s reproductive rights, Bush places himself firmly at odds with Virginia values.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.cruxnow.com/life/2015/05/10/jeb-bush-obama-is-intolerant-of-christianity/", "image": "http://www.cruxnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/75f8de296a272030b5a6faee622c26b7-750x568.jpeg", "type": "article", "description": "Former Florida Gov.
