But we think there should be acknowledgment that reggae was created in Jamaica,\u201d said Michael \u201cIbo\u201d Cooper, a musician who is chairman of the Jamaica Reggae Industry Association.\n\nAround the world, music festivals celebrating the sounds made famous by reggae patron saint Bob Marley and followers who developed the faster, brasher derivative of dancehall are more likely to be headlined by bands from places like California or France than by native-born Jamaicans. Aside from albums by the late Marley or his progeny, few of the top-selling reggae CDs or downloads come from Jamaican artists.\n\nTo get a stronger foothold in the information age, Jamaican officials and reggae industry insiders are brainstorming ways to better capitalize on Jamaica\u2019s exuberant music culture and help protect what some claim is local intellectual property. After years of only piecemeal support, the government increasingly is viewing reggae and other cultural enterprises as a hoped-for economic engine on the island.\n\nOfficials are hashing over the creation of a certification mark to designate \u201cauthentic reggae\u201d \u2014 a sort of \u201cGood Housekeeping Seal\u201d \u2014 to encourage the use of Jamaican musicians, producers and merchandise. They also hope to defend Jamaican reggae by having the U.N.\u2019s culture organization add it to a global list of \u201cintangible cultural heritage \u201d such as Argentina\u2019s tango and China\u2019s Peking opera. The Paris-based agency says the island\u2019s government has yet to apply for inclusion on the list of more than 280 cultural traditions.\n\nRob Bowman, a music professor from Canada\u2019s York University who has researched intellectual property and Jamaican music, said that while population numbers mean reggae\u2019s biggest markets always will be overseas there\u2019s no reason why more revenue streams from foreign commerce shouldn\u2019t flow back to Jamaica.\n\n\u201cWith few exceptions, these styles of music cannot be authentically replicated by non-Jamaicans. As such, these styles of music represent intellectual property that is, for all intents and purposes, already a part of Jamaica\u2019s branding,\u201d Bowman asserts in a World Intellectual Property Organization consultancy report for Jamaica.\n\nA country of fewer than 3 million people, Jamaica has had remarkable success originating influential musical forms such as ska, rocksteady, reggae, dub and dancehall. Musicologists say production innovations and the discovery of \u201ctoasting,\u201d reggae deejays chanting over a beat, directly inspired hip-hop.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jamaica moving to reclaim global dominance in reggae", "title": "Jamaica moving to reclaim global dominance in reggae", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Jamaica moving to reclaim global dominance in reggae", "title": "Jamaica moving to reclaim global dominance in reggae", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/03/08/jamaica_moving_to_reclaim_global_dominance_in_reggae/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/jamaica-global-reggae.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jamaica moving to reclaim global dominance in reggae", "title": "Jamaica moving to reclaim global dominance in reggae", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/03/jamaica-global-reggae.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "DAVID McFADDEN", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd315a\"", "article_summary": "But we think there should be acknowledgment that reggae was created in Jamaica,\u201d said Michael \u201cIbo\u201d Cooper, a musician who is chairman of the Jamaica Reggae Industry Association.\n\u201cReggae was given to the world by Jamaica so nobody can or ever should discourage anyone overseas from making this music.\nThey also hope to defend Jamaican reggae by having the U.N.\u2019s culture organization add it to a global list of \u201cintangible cultural heritage \u201d such as Argentina\u2019s tango and China\u2019s Peking opera.\nA country of fewer than 3 million people, Jamaica has had remarkable success originating influential musical forms such as ska, rocksteady, reggae, dub and dancehall.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsKINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) \u2014 For decades, the sound of Jamaica has been reggae, the infectious, uniquely syncopated music that transformed the small Caribbean island into a cultural powerhouse."}
