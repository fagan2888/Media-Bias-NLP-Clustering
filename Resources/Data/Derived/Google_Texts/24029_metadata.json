Local lawmakers are trying to ban \u201ccamping out\u201d in public, and ordering police to clear the fetid encampments.\n\nBut lawyers for the homeless are pushing back. They\u2019re demanding that \u201csleeping rough\u201d be legally protected. In Denver, where living on the street is outlawed, lawyers for the homeless want to guarantee vagrants \u201cthe right to use and move freely in public spaces without discrimination.\u201d\n\nOutrageously, the Obama administration is siding with vagrants against local governments. Obama\u2019s Justice Department is trying to block Boise, Idaho\u2019s ban on sleeping in public. Cities around the country are worried their own laws may be next.\n\nNot New York, of course. In our city, lawyers for the homeless already run City Hall. One of Mayor De Blasio\u2019s top advisers is Steven Banks, a lawyer who spent three decades at the Legal Aid Society and has sued the city numerous times on behalf of the homeless.\n\nUnder de Blasio\u2019s tenure, 311 calls complaining about the homeless are up nearly 60 percent. The mayor dismisses that as \u201chysteria,\u201d insisting the vast majority of homeless \u201cdon\u2019t bother anybody.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles \u2014 the homeless capital of the nation \u2014 is trying to halt the spread of cardboard shanties: Obamavilles. But the city has lost a string of lawsuits, as judges ruled the homeless have constitutional rights to sleep in cars and store their possessions on the sidewalk.\n\nLos Angeles is short on shelter beds, but beds alone don\u2019t solve the problem. In New York, homeless families generally go to shelters. But 80 percent of vagrants are single adults with mental illness or drug addiction. Their insistence on street living punishes the rest of us. We have to endure the heart-wrenching sights of human beings in rags lying on sidewalks.\n\nJail may not be the answer, but allowing street living isn\u2019t, either. There has to be an involuntary mental-health alternative. De Blasio is sending treatment teams to the streets for individualized care. But it\u2019s voluntary. Many will reject help. The city should also get vagrants off the street. That is, if the feds allow it.\n\nBoise is trying to ban street encampments it deems unsanitary and unsafe. But on Aug. 6, the Obama Justice Department intervened to stop the city. The DOJ argues that depriving people of a \u201cright\u201d to sleep on the street if there are no shelter beds is a \u201ccruel and unusual punishment,\u201d violating the Constitution. Not enough beds? The city insists there are.\n\nThe DOJ\u2019s intervention is a warning to cities everywhere. Homeless advocate Carol Sobel warns that cities must \u201cfigure out how to respond to the causes of homelessness and not punish people for their status.\u201d That\u2019s the wacky ideology cities will be battling in lawsuit after lawsuit \u2014 that living on the street is acceptable and deserves legal protection.\n\nSadly, that\u2019s the prevailing mentality in the de Blasio administration as well. Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani considered homeless encampments a scourge. But de Blasio says \u201cit\u2019s not against the law to be homeless.\u201d His emphasis is on serving the homeless, increasing funding for \u201chomeless services\u201d by $1 billion. Not protecting the public.\n\nNever mind the violent crimes committed by mentally ill street dwellers. On June 23, a woman was attacked by a machete-waving vagrant in Bryant Park; on July 25, a tourist was hospitalized after being assaulted by a homeless man; Police Commissioner Bill Bratton is warning that street dwellers are using a synthetic marijuana that makes them \u201cirrational, impervious to pain, and very dangerous.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio blames \u201cinequality\u201d for the danger and disturbing sights on our streets. Wrong.
