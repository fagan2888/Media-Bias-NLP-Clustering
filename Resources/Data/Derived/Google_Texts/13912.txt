Think you can grab a quick cold drink or bag of chips from a vending machine when you want a snack? Perhaps not for much longer. Rheavendors and Smart Vend Solutions have unveiled a new ‘innovative’ vending machine that can use facial recognition, medical records and your age in order to determine whether you will be allowed to buy that soda or bag of chips – or not.

That's right fatties, no sugar for you! #ObamaCare & Luce X2 will see to that. New Vending Machine Knows Who You Are http://t.co/BlNWft49Q9 — Obama's Real Tweets (@IamPOTUSbitches) December 8, 2014

The public’s introduction to the Luce X2 Touch TV vending machine happened in Hertfordshire, UK. Examples given were that schools could program the machines not to sell cigarettes to underage students and gyms could program the machine not to sell fattening snacks to certain clients.

Luce X2, the future of vending technology: will this machine stop you snacking post-gym? @Telegraph http://t.co/1s55VM9sRA #fmteam — Anna Cordes (@AVCordes) December 9, 2014

The elephant in the room is why schools would sell cigarettes and why gyms would sell fattening snacks, to begin with.

As an aside, the machine won an award in 2011.

Not only are vending machines in the United States now required to openly display calorie counts of the items for sale in them, but this ‘innovation,’ if implemented here, could take the nanny state’s control over vending machine snacking to a whole new level.
