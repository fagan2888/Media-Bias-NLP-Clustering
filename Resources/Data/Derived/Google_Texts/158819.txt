If you are single and looking to meet other unmarried people, you should head to San Francisco.

With nearly 40 percent of its population over 20 unmarried, the California city ranked as the best city in the country for singles, according to a list compiled by Rent.com.

The usual suspects made the list, with the top five also including Manhattan, Washington D.C., Boston and Seattle. Oddly absent from the list though is Los Angeles.

If you want to live in a big city on a tight budget, head to Chicago, where rents for a one-bedroom apartment are the cheapest. For the best nightlife and restaurants, Manhattan is the place to be.

There were 103 million unmarried people over the age of 18 in the U.S. in 2012, or 44 percent of all U.S. residents over 18, according to data from the Census Bureau. More than 53 percent of American singles [JL1] are women. Of course, this doesn’t mean that couples aren’t sharing apartments and a lot more. Many simply haven’t been “hitched.”

The Rent.com list is based on cities with more than 50,000 rental dwellings, a high concentration of single adults and an overall population greater than 100,000. Safety, nightlife, dining options and coffee shop density were all factors taken into account to compile the ranking.
