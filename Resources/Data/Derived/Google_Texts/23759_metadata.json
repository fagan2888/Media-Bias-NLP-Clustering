The work could offer clues to rehabilitation after stroke, brain injury, maybe one day even spinal cord injury.\n\n\u201cIt holds open the hope that we may be able to facilitate that recovery process,\u201d said Dr. Scott Frey, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Missouri in Columbia.\n\nWhen surgeons attach a new hand, nerves from the stump must regenerate into the transplanted limb to begin restoring different sensations, hot or cold, soft or hard, pressure or pain. While patients can move a new hand fairly soon, how quickly they regain feeling and what sensations they experience vary widely.\n\nAfter all, the sense of touch isn\u2019t just about stimulating nerves in the skin. Those nerves fire signals to a specific brain region to decipher what you\u2019re touching and how to react. Lose a limb and the brain quickly rewires, giving those neurons new jobs. Frey\u2019s work shows the area that once operated a right hand can start giving the left hand a boost.\n\nBrain scans suggest those changes are at least partially reversible if someone gets a hand transplant years later. But little is known about how the brain\u2019s reorganization affects recovery.\n\nTelling where on the palms or fingers they\u2019re being touched without looking is a persistent problem for hand transplant recipients, and a function of the brain\u2019s main sensory area. Frey\u2019s team compared four transplant recipients, four patients whose own hands were reattached immediately after injury, and 14 uninjured people.\n\nThe longer the time since their surgeries, the more accurately patients located a light touch, Frey reported. Two who\u2019ve had transplanted hands for eight and 10 years, respectively, were almost as accurate as uninjured people. So were two patients whose own hands were reattached 1\u00bd and three years earlier.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hand transplant recovery sheds new light on touch", "title": "Hand transplant recovery sheds new light on touch", "og": {"url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/11/16/hand_transplant_recovery_sheds_new_light_on_touch/", "site_name": "Salon", "type": "article", "description": "Hand transplant recovery sheds new light on touch", "title": "Hand transplant recovery sheds new light on touch"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hand transplant recovery sheds new light on touch", "title": "Hand transplant recovery sheds new light on touch", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@salon"}, "author": "Lauran Neergaard", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Brain scans suggest those changes are at least partially reversible if someone gets a hand transplant years later.\nTelling where on the palms or fingers they\u2019re being touched without looking is a persistent problem for hand transplant recipients, and a function of the brain\u2019s main sensory area.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Recovery of feeling can gradually improve for years after a hand transplant, suggests a small study that points to changes in the brain, not just the new hand, as a reason.\nTwo who\u2019ve had transplanted hands for eight and 10 years, respectively, were almost as accurate as uninjured people.\nFrey\u2019s work shows the area that once operated a right hand can start giving the left hand a boost."}
