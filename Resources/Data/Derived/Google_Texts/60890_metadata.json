However, the financial funds promised in the ACA were cut amid squabbles in Congress. Health Republic is the fourth co-op to close in recent months, according to published reports.\n\nThis fall, in a letter to members, Health Republic CEO Debra Friedman blamed the government for the financial challenges of running a co-op program.\n\nTwitter: @SusanJMorse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/failed-health-republic-co-op-owes-new-york-hospitals-more-150-million", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/NYC-skyline-Flickr-feature_0.jpg", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The nonprofit co-op Health Republic Insurance of New York owes hospitals within the Greater New York Hospital Association more than $150 million, according to a November 11 letter from President Kenneth Raske to member CEOs.", "title": "Failed Health Republic co-op owes New York hospitals more than $150 million"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/NYC-skyline-Flickr-feature_0.jpg"}, "description": "The nonprofit co-op Health Republic Insurance of New York owes hospitals within the Greater New York Hospital Association more than $150 million, according to a November 11 letter from President Kenneth Raske to member CEOs.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Failed Health Republic co-op owes New York hospitals more than $150 million"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "The nonprofit co-op Health Republic Insurance of New York owes hospitals within the Greater New York Hospital Association more than $150 million, according to a November 11 letter from President Kenneth Raske to member CEOs.&#13; \"This is a dire situation -- several hospitals have reported Health Republic receivables of more than $10 million,\" Raske said.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "\"At a minimum, Health Republic owes GNYHA member hospitals more than $142 million, and that amount is likely to surpass $150 million.\"\nThe nonprofit co-op Health Republic Insurance of New York owes hospitals within the Greater New York Hospital Association more than $150 million, according to a November 11 letter from President Kenneth Raske to member CEOs.\n\"This is a dire situation -- several hospitals have reported Health Republic receivables of more than $10 million,\" Raske said.\n[Also: Health Republic Insurance co-op ordered to close over financial losses]\"A GNYHA (Greater New York Hospital Association) survey has found that our member hospitals' Health Republic receivables are significantly worse than previously anticipated,\" Raske said.\nRaske said New York health insurers remain profitable overall, but several nonprofit plans that incurred losses in 2014 bear watching."}
