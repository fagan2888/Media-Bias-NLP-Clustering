If found guilty, she faces expulsion.\n\nNo decision was announced on Sunday, and the court set the next hearing for December 1 as it awaited a UN High Commissioner for Refugees ruling on a request for asylum.\n\nA UNHCR representative confirmed to AFP that Huda had initiated proceedings to be granted refugee status in Yemen.\n\nIf she succeeds, it will be difficult for the authorities in Yemen to expel her.\n\nHuda\u2019s case has also come to the attention of the New York-based Human Rights Watch.\n\nOn November 19, HRW urged Yemen not to repatriate her and to take into consideration the fact that returning to her family could put her life at risk.\n\n\u201cShe fears physical harm from her family members, whom she said have beaten her in the past, if she is returned to Saudi Arabia,\u201d HRW said in a statement.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Saudi-Juliet-demands-right-to-marry-her-Yemeni-Romeo-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "Saudi Arabian Juliet demands right to marry her Yemeni Romeo"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ff1\"", "article_summary": "A young Saudi woman on Sunday urged a Yemeni court to let her stay and marry the man she loves, defying norms in both deeply conservative countries.\nIn a case reminiscent of Shakespeare\u2019s star-crossed lovers Romeo and Juliet, Huda al-Niran, 22, defied her family and crossed the border illegally to be with her beloved.\nIn court, she refused to accept a lawyer provided by the Saudi embassy, fearing pressure to return home.\n\u201cThis is a humanitarian case, and must not raise tensions between the two countries,\u201d lawyer Abdel Rakib al-Qadi told AFP.\nBut Huda did accept to be represented by a lawyer appointed by a Yemeni non-government organisation called Hood, who said he hoped for a favourable outcome."}
