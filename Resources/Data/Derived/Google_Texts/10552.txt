You can't be in Sarasota for long without having somebody assure you that "you're only as old as you feel."

This mind-body cliche has been quantified by scientists in interesting ways — including a series of experiments by Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer, detailed in this coming Sunday's New York Times Magazine.

It starts out with a story about her 1981 study with a group of men in their 70s, who huddled for five days in an environment designed to make them feel they were two decades younger; it worked so well that at the end of the session they tossed aside their canes for a spontaneous game of touch football.

But the problem with the premise that attitude trumps decrepitude is a lazy, automatic acceptance of its corollary — that there's something truly shameful and blameworthy about being old. And a whole new body of research is emerging around a more profound idea: that how you feel about being old truly determines how old you feel.

"Subjective aging" is a term that's been around for a while that is finding new currency. The phrase crops up often in the program for November's annual scientific meeting of the Gerontological Society of America in Washington, D.C., and I'm hoping to have lots to report back on from there.

In the meantime, an intriguing experiment by some Yale researchers, just published online in Psychological Science, suggests that the body certainly feels what the mind perceives about social stereotypes on aging. Older adults who underwent persuasive interventions to help them view aging more positively actually became more physically agile as a result.

Professor Becca Levy's team recruited 100 people 60 and older, and divided them into three groups. One group got implicit conditioning — those subliminal visual flashes of words that the brain registers almost unconsciously. The words that bombarded them were admiring descriptors of aging, like "creative," — as opposed to condescending ones like "spry."

A second group got both the word flashes and some essay-writing exercises about "a senior citizen who is mentally and physically healthy." A third group went through the same types of visual stimuli and exercises, but the perceptions about aging were carefully neutral.

By Week 8, the first group — those who were shown rather than told that being old has its upsides — were significantly more conditioned to believe it than the other two groups. Both their perceptions of old age and their self-assessments had soared.

But what was stunning was how this translated into physical improvement. In tests where they had to stand up and sit down rapidly, walk eight steps and then stand with feet together, the first group outperformed their peers by far.

Another recent study at the University of Michigan underscores the relationship between perceptions about old age and physical health. More than 6,000 people in the U.S. Health and Retirement study were assessed for their level of "aging satisfaction" — defined as "a person's evaluation of his or her own aging process, including changes in feelings of usefulness, energy level, and quality of life."

The higher the aging satisfaction, researchers found, the more likely an older person is to seek out preventive health services, instead of just waiting for the next medical crisis.

HAPPY HALLOWEEN

But don't get too cheerful! In the spirit of the season, the American Society on Aging has come out with "Six Scary Facts about Aging."

-- One in seven adults age 65 or older lives in poverty.

-- In 2014 there are an estimated 5.2 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease. This number is expected to rise to 13.8 million by 2050.

-- 63 percent of older adults say they have experienced discrimination.

-- Family caregivers provide $450 billion worth of unpaid care every year.

-- While 80 percent of long-term care in the U.S. is provided by family members, LGBT elders are twice as likely as heterosexuals to be single and three to four times more likely to be without children.

-- The Older Americans Act has not been reauthorized since it expired in 2011.
