For 31-year-old Kyle Jones, it's age. Lots and lots of age. The Atlanta, Ga., man is in a casual relationship with 91-year-old Majorie McCool, and despite the 60-year age gap, the couple isn\u2019t lacking sparks in the bedroom.\n\nFrom age 12, Jones remembers liking older women. \u201cEveryone\u2019s brains are wired differently. I\u2019m wired towards older women,\u201d Jones explains in a YouTube video. Jones meets his older ladies via online dating websites, but his affections are not always warmly met. \"Whenever I'm trying to speak to an older woman, the first reaction I get is 'You're way too young.' I find persistence is good, so I tell them it'll be fun,'\" Jones told the Daily Mail.\n\n91-Year-Old Main Squeeze\n\nAlthough Jones is involved in a number of open relationships with older women, his \"main squeeze\" is 91-year-old McCool, Gawker reported. The great-grandmother couldn\u2019t be any more delighted to have a boyfriend so much younger than herself, although she admits that at times things get confusing. \u201cSometimes I feel he\u2019s like another son, until we hop into bed and then I feel different,\u201d McCool said. The age gap has not seemed to make any noticeable difference in their sex life. \"The physical side of our relationship is wonderful. I amaze myself, he amazes me. There's nothing better. I wear sexy outfits to bed. I try to keep my bra on though because I don't have much left,\u201d she said.\n\nFriends and Family Cool with It\n\nFriends and family of the couple may have been skeptical at first, but after five years of dating, they've come to accept the non-traditional relationship. \"My family consists mostly of boys, and they don't really care \u2014 what I do is my business,\u201d McCool said. Jones\u2019s mother at first viewed her son\u2019s preference for older women as a phase. \u201cI think a lot of children have crushes on their teachers, so it didn't strike me as strange. I really wasn't sure if that was something that he was going to stay with or if it was just a cougar phase some young men go through,\u201d Ceceila Jones Clark, 50, Jones's mother told the Daily Mail. However, after she starting spending quality time with his older girlfriends, Jones\u2019s mother came to realize this wasn\u2019t a phase but a lifestyle.\n\nNature Prefers It the Other Way Around\n\nFrom a biological viewpoint, this partnership is quite unique. Older man plus younger woman means more children, but the other way around leaves a couple childless. Men maximize their \u201cevolutionary fitness,\" meaning their ability to pass on their genes to future generations, by mating with a women 14.6 years younger, The Telegraph reported. Dr. Samuli Helle from the University of Turka in Finland observed that in the nomadic Sami people of Finland, couples with this ideal age ratio had the highest number of children surviving to adulthood. \u201cYoung Sami women were the most fertile and had the highest reproductive value, whereas older Sami men had acquired enough skills needed for successful hunting, fishing and reindeer herding and, most importantly, wealth to be good providers for the progeny and thus desirable mates,\" Helle and his partner concluded.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "31, year, old, man, prefers, date, great, grandmothers, because, hes, wired, differently", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A 31-year-old man's relationship with a 91-year-old woman isn't exactly what you would call \"typical.\"", "title": "A 60-Year Age Gap Couldn\u2019t Keep These Lovers Apart [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/31-year-old-man-prefers-date-great-grandmothers-because-hes-wired-differently-286974", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/old-lady.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A 31-year-old man's relationship with a 91-year-old woman isn't exactly what you would call \"typical.\"", "title": "A 60-Year Age Gap Couldn\u2019t Keep These Lovers Apart [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/31-year-old-man-prefers-date-great-grandmothers-because-hes-wired-differently-286974", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/old-lady.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/06/old-lady.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-06-06T17:27:37-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-06T17:27:36-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A 31-year-old man's relationship with a 91-year-old woman isn't exactly what you would call \"typical.\""}, "article_summary": "I\u2019m wired towards older women,\u201d Jones explains in a YouTube video.\nJones\u2019s mother at first viewed her son\u2019s preference for older women as a phase.\nFrom age 12, Jones remembers liking older women.\n91-Year-Old Main SqueezeAlthough Jones is involved in a number of open relationships with older women, his \"main squeeze\" is 91-year-old McCool, Gawker reported.\n\"Whenever I'm trying to speak to an older woman, the first reaction I get is 'You're way too young.'"}
