Colorado State Patrol is investigating after a driver heading the wrong way on U.S. Highway 50 in Pueblo caused a fatal head-on crash, officials said.

Colorado State Patrol spokesman Nate Reid said troopers responded to a traffic complaint of a Ford Ranger going the wrong direction on Colorado State Highway 45.

The driver then got onto Highway 50, going westbound in the eastbound lanes with no headlights, Reid said.

A mile west of Pueblo Boulevard, Reid said the Ford Ranger driver struck a four-door sedan head on, killing the sedan driver.

The driver of the Ford Ranger was transported to a hospital, Reid said.

U.S. 50 west of Pueblo is closed eastbound with no estimated time of reopening according to a tweet by the Colorado Department of Transportation.
