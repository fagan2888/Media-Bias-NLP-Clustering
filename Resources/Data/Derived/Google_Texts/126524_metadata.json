He's due to be back in a Dallas Cowboys uniform on Sunday.\n\nWhether or not you like the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, this news may warm your heart:\n\nJon Kitna, who is coming out of retirement to be the team's emergency quarterback on Sunday, plans to donate his $53,000 paycheck from the game to the Tacoma, Wash., high school where he now teaches math and coaches football.\n\nAccording to the Dallas Morning News:\n\n\"Much has been made of the Cowboys signing high school math teacher Jon Kitna out of retirement to figure into their quarterback puzzle against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday. Almost every reference has mentioned the quarterback, who retired from the Cowboys after the 2011 season, will earn about $53,000 for his Christmas week's work. \"Only Kitna, 41, is not keeping the money. It didn't come up in his Christmas Day media scrum in the locker room. But later, while relaxing on a locker room couch and reconnecting with radio play-by-play voice Brad Sham, Kitna said he would be donating his NFL check to his school [Lincoln High in Tacoma]. He also told several teammates.\"\n\nKitna has been pressed into service by the team because a herniated disc may keep starting quarterback Tony Romo from playing. Romo's backup, Kyle Orton, is expected to start instead. Kitna has been tapped to be Orton's backup and he's helping at practices this week while Romo rests.\n\nSunday night's game against the Philadelphia Eagles is important: Whichever team wins will get into the playoffs. NBC-TV is the broadcaster.\n\nLincoln High, according to The Seattle Times, is where Kitna went to high school. He guided his team \"to an 8-2 record this season, but the Abes lost to eventual state runner-up Eastside Catholic in the district playoffs. Kitna is 13-7 in two seasons as head coach.\"\n\nHe retired after the 2011 season. Kitna's last three years were with the Cowboys \u2014 mostly as Romo's backup. Earlier in his career, he had been a starter with the Seattle Seahawks, Cincinnati Bengals and Detroit Lions.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ideastream.org/news/npr/257372387", "site_name": "ideastream", "type": "article", "title": "Cowboys' Emergency QB Kitna Will Give Away His Pay"}, "keywords": "ideastream, wcpn, wviz, 90.3, cleveland public radio, channel 25, wviz/pbs, 90.3 wcpn, cleveland public media, wviz/pbs ideastream, 90.3 wcpn ideastream, wcpn ideastream, wviz ideastream, cleveland, ohio, 104.9 FM, WCLV, WCLV 104.9", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "google-site-verification": "YaOLAImmbo8IrZtjGAAHQYvbhtD-xUhGeJ1QDi4beRI"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddfa8\"", "article_summary": "He's due to be back in a Dallas Cowboys uniform on Sunday.\nLincoln High, according to The Seattle Times, is where Kitna went to high school.\nAccording to the Dallas Morning News:\"Much has been made of the Cowboys signing high school math teacher Jon Kitna out of retirement to figure into their quarterback puzzle against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday.\nKitna has been pressed into service by the team because a herniated disc may keep starting quarterback Tony Romo from playing.\nQuarterback Jon Kitna in 2011, before his retirement from football."}
