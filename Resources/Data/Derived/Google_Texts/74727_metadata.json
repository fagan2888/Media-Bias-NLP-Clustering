European Pressphoto Agency\n\nEgypt\u2019s effort to revive its stagnant energy industry has attracted billions of dollars in new investment recently, but the country still has to address bureaucratic and legal hurdles before it becomes an attractive business hub, some executives say.\n\n\u201cEgypt is a good place to invest because the best time to invest in a country or in a project is when you are at the bottom of the investment cycle\u2026but there is a need to reduce bureaucracy and red tape,\u201d said Patrick Allman-Ward, the chief executive of Dana Gas, an energy firm based in the United Arab Emirates that operates in Egypt.\n\nForeign energy companies operating in Egypt are also facing a situation in which state-owned companies are acting as partners and regulators at the same time, Mr. Ward said.\n\n\u201cIt is a very strange situation to be in where your partner is also the person who is saying what you can and cannot do,\u201d he said.\n\nEgypt was once a mid-sized player among the Middle East\u2019s massive energy industry, producing enough oil and gas for both domestic needs and a large amount of exports. Its energy industry was upended by the overthrow of president Hosni Mubarak during the Arab Spring in 2011. Continuing civil unrest since then has led to a slowdown in oil and gas exploitation activities as well as its inability to pay foreign firms for existing output.\n\nPresident Abdel Fattah Al Sisi has launched an effort in the past nine months to reinvigorate his country\u2019s energy industry. Among the changes: cutting government energy subsidies to consumers, using foreign aid to reduce debt owed to foreign firms to $3.1 billion from about $7 billion, and introducing new mechanisms to resolve commercial disputes.\n\nThe country of nearly 90 million is also letting gas producers push for higher prices, depending on distance from shore, reservoir depth and the costs of the development of the discovery. Some energy companies are now allowed to offset signing bounces\u2013a one-off fee paid to seal an exploration deal\u2013against receivables rather than pay upfront.\n\nEgypt, which produced 5.1 billion cubic feet per day of gas and 675,000 barrels of oil per day during 2013-2014 fiscal year, is now targeting 5.4 billion cubic feet per day of gas and 695,000 barrels a day for 2014-2015.\n\nThe initiatives were featured at the center of an economic conference last weekend in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh. The biggest deal was signed with British oil major BP PLC, which plans to invest around $12 billion with its partners to develop the West Nile Delta gas fields. The project has the potential to meet a quarter of Egypt\u2019s gas needs.\n\nThe country\u2019s oil minister Sherif Ismail said the deals showed that Egypt now has \u201ca very good reputation in the energy world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to improve our image, we just want to showcase our reforms,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Egypt\u2019s effort to revive its moribund energy industry has attracted tens of millions of dollars in new investment recently, but the country still has to address bureaucratic and legal hurdles before it becomes an attractive business hub, some executives say.", "title": "Egypt, Plagued by Energy Bureaucracy, Highlights New Investment", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2015/03/20/egypt-plagued-by-energy-bureaucracy-highlights-new-investment/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HK347_sisi03_P_20150315122641.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Business", "article.headline": "Egypt, Plagued by Energy Bureaucracy, Highlights New Investment", "description": "Egypt\u2019s effort to revive its moribund energy industry has attracted tens of millions of dollars in new investment recently, but the country still has to address bureaucratic and legal hurdles before it becomes an attractive business hub, some executives say.", "article_section": "Business", "author": "Summer Said", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "Corporate Intelligence Blog", "page.subsection": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.summary": "Egypt\u2019s effort to revive its moribund energy industry has attracted tens of millions of dollars in new investment recently, but the country still has to address bureaucratic and legal hurdles before it becomes an attractive business hub, some executives say.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2015-03-20T16:03:57-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2015/03/20/egypt-plagued-by-energy-bureaucracy-highlights-new-investment/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-234B-6313", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Business", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Egypt\u2019s effort to revive its moribund energy industry has attracted tens of millions of dollars in new investment recently, but the country still has to address bureaucratic and legal hurdles before it becomes an attractive business hub, some executives say.", "title": "Egypt, Plagued by Energy Bureaucracy, Highlights New Investment", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2015/03/20/egypt-plagued-by-energy-bureaucracy-highlights-new-investment/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-HK347_sisi03_P_20150315122641.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Corporate Intelligence", "article.id": "BL-234B-6313", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-03-20T16:54:06-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddef8\"", "article_summary": "President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi has launched an effort in the past nine months to reinvigorate his country\u2019s energy industry.\nIts energy industry was upended by the overthrow of president Hosni Mubarak during the Arab Spring in 2011.\nForeign energy companies operating in Egypt are also facing a situation in which state-owned companies are acting as partners and regulators at the same time, Mr. Ward said.\nEgypt was once a mid-sized player among the Middle East\u2019s massive energy industry, producing enough oil and gas for both domestic needs and a large amount of exports.\nEuropean Pressphoto AgencyEgypt\u2019s effort to revive its stagnant energy industry has attracted billions of dollars in new investment recently, but the country still has to address bureaucratic and legal hurdles before it becomes an attractive business hub, some executives say."}
