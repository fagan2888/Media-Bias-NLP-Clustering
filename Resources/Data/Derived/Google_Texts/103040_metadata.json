Obesity brings on secondary, serious illnesses at a much earlier stage of life. A yearlong local study, part of a $6-million federal grant, finds the greatest link to childhood obesity can be family income and the resulting lifestyle and food habits.\n\nDell Children\u2019s Medical Center, the UT Health Science Center and other agencies put 400 children in a control group and another 400 in a tightly monitored and coordinated program of diet and exercise. \u201cIf you\u2019re living in a poor part of town you tend to have less resources to purchase healthy foods,\u201d Pediatrician Dr. Stephen Pont explained. \u201cYour parks may not be as safe; It\u2019s harder to get around; you have very busy lives. All those factors contribute to make it difficult to be healthy.\u201d\n\nThis can lead to earlier high blood pressure, cholesterol, liver cirrhosis, sleep apnea and diabetes. \u201cWe have kids struggling now with conditions we used to only see in adults,\u201d Pont said. \u201cAnd a huge driver of that is if you\u2019re at a healthy weight or not.\u201d\n\nSome parents, perhaps overweight themselves, are in denial and don\u2019t see it in their kids. Not Juana Lopez. She knew her 13-year-old son Juan was a likely diabetic, and she was thrilled when he got into the program, \u201cWhen I got the call I was so happy,\u201d Juana said. \u201cThey helped me a lot with Juan. He was overweight, and so was I.\u201d\n\nIn fact, mom and son joined together in better eating habits and running together. It was a bonding experience and they lost weight together. \u201cShe saw how much I struggled, Juan said of his mom. \u201cI didn\u2019t have a coach to keep me going, so she decided to step in. We ran together.\u201d\n\nAfter a year in the program, Juana adds, \u201cI am very happy now, and I appreciate all the help they gave my son and my family. I am very proud of my son.\u201d\n\nLilia Zavaleta saw her 7-year-old son Raul putting on weight. He had a big time sweet tooth. Over the year he came to love exercise and sports and even gave up those sweet treats. \u201cThat helped him eat better,\u201d Lilia said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want more candy, he eats fruits and vegetables.\u201d\n\nJuan Lopez says his new habits helped him not only lose weight, but gain strength and his diabetes threat is fading away. \u201cDiabetes can kill you so I say eat well, work out, don\u2019t just lay on the couch and eat chips,\u201d he said with a smile.\n\nThe study results, which will be released this spring, are expected to show the importance of a well rounded plan for kids and that they stick to it.
