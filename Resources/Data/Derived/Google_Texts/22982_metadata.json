She says she police came to her house to tell her she couldn\u2019t be there, but didn\u2019t tell her they would be using the home. Via Action News Jacksonville:\n\n[Deborah] Franz said it all started shortly after overhearing a fight at her neighbor's house across the street Sunday. A short time later, the SWAT team swarmed her neighborhood.\n\n\n\n\"The cop goes 'You all need to leave, you can't be in your house,'\" said Franz.\n\n\n\nThat happened around 1 p.m. About six hours later, deputies cleared the scene and she went back home. But something was off when she walked through the door.\n\n\n\n\"I stopped, I froze because I realized somebody had messed with my TV,\" said Franz.\n\n\n\nFranz said her blinds were opened, her Xbox and TV were disconnected, and a drape over her bedroom window was thrown on the floor.\n\n\n\nAt first she thought it was a burglar but then realized nothing was missing.\n\nThat\u2019s when she realized it must have been police who invaded her home, and says a phone call to the sheriff\u2019s office confirmed it. No biggie, say the experts. Via Action News Jax again:\n\nWyllie Hodges, who now heads First Coast Crime Stoppers, is a 34-year law enforcement veteran, and he said it doesn't surprise him.\n\n\n\n\"A SWAT call out is just not a normal police call out. It's just different and the circumstances are mandated or dictated by the situation as it progresses,\" said Hodges.\n\nCould the Third Amendment apply? SWAT teams aren\u2019t soldiers just yet. Maybe you can\u2019t say you live in an authoritarian country until the ruling party is sending you to a gulag. The Third Amendment has been invoked in a similar-ish case in Nevada, where police invaded and occupied the Mitchell home while responding to a domestic violence report at a neighbor\u2019s house. In Franz\u2019s case, she wasn\u2019t even afforded the opportunity to attempt to prevent police from taking over her home. She says all she wants is an apology. The sheriff\u2019s department would only say that the incident would get the \u201csame scrutiny\u201d for \u201cbest practices\u201d all their tactics and operations constantly get.\n\nThe only Supreme Court decision relevant to the Third Amendment was Engblom v. Carey, which involved the quartering of national guardsmen in prison employee housing during a prison guard strike. The court ruled the Third Amendment extended to the National Guard as soldiers, and that tenancy was a sufficient condition for the prohibition of quartering to apply. Nevertheless, when the case was returned to a district court, it decided in the favor of the defendants, citing the qualified immunity enjoyed by government employees.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Don't call SWAT soldiers?", "title": "What Third Amendment?
