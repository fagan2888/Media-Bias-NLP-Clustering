All the officers were white. None of the residents whose doors they had knocked on had shown any hostility toward them, he said.\n\n\u201cI was shocked to be arrested,\u201d said Tapia, an Ecuadorian immigrant who is studying at the Illinois Institute of Technology. \u201cEspecially for engaging in a lawful activity.\u201d\n\nTapia \u2014 who said he was also telling Garfield Ridge residents about the deadlines to sign up for health insurance under \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2014 said he\u2019s worried the arrest could affect his immigration status and ability to find work when he graduates.\n\n\u201cThis arrest was simply unfair, unjust and simply outrageous,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Chicago Police spokesman Marty Maloney said that \u201cCPD expressly prohibits racial profiling or any other bias-based policing.\n\n\u201cThis matter stemmed from a 911 call made by a city resident, and there is no basis to suggest that this is indicative of anything other than that.\u201d\n\nA police source said that the neighborhood had suffered a series of door-to-door scams in the weeks leading up to the arrests of Tapia and Hernandez, and that the officers were concerned that neither man could provide identification from the organization that they worked for, or the name of their supervisor.\n\nBut activists at a news conference Tuesday morning denied that, connecting the arrests to high-profile national disputes about police use of racial profiling.\n\nAmisha Patel, the executive director of the left-wing pressure group that Tapia and Hernandez were canvassing for, Grassroots Collaborative, said, \u201cIt is the right and duty of citizens to talk to their neighbors about the issues they feel strongly about.\u201d\n\nPatel said that the arrests of Tapia and Hernandez are a concern for activists who want to participate in the upcoming city elections.\n\n\u201cAre they in danger of getting arrested for door-knocking and talking to their neighbors about the things that they care about?\u201d Patel asked.\n\n\u201cThe CPD needs to admit their mistake, they need to apologize and they need to work to make sure something like this does not happen again.\n\n\u201cWe all deserve to live in a city where we can talk to anybody in any neighborhood, especially if they are young men of color who are working to make their communities better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>A pair of young Latino political activists who were arrested and charged by Chicago Police while canvassing in a white neighborhood on the", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/latino-activists-arrested-while-canvassing-in-white-neighborhood-sue-cpd/", "site": "@suntimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Latino activists arrested while canvassing in white neighborhood sue"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282828", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Weather and More", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.suntimes.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/news/latino-activists-arrested-while-canvassing-in-white-neighborhood-sue-cpd/", "type": "article", "site_name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "title": "Latino activists arrested while canvassing in white neighborhood sue CPD"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Latino activists arrested while canvassing in white neighborhood sue CPDA pair of young Latino political activists who were arrested and charged by Chicago Police while canvassing in a white neighborhood on the Southwest Side last year have filed a federal lawsuit, alleging they were racially profiled.\n\u201cI was shocked to be arrested,\u201d said Tapia, an Ecuadorian immigrant who is studying at the Illinois Institute of Technology.\nBut Chicago Police spokesman Marty Maloney said that \u201cCPD expressly prohibits racial profiling or any other bias-based policing.\nAll the officers were white.\n\u201cAre they in danger of getting arrested for door-knocking and talking to their neighbors about the things that they care about?\u201d Patel asked."}
