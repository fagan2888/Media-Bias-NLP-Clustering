Group and Regions Insurance had everything to do with the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRegions Insurance Inc., a subsidiary of Regions Insurance Group and an affiliate of Regions Bank, announced last week that it had purchased The A.I. Group, previously one of the largest privately held employee benefits firms in Georgia. The company has headquarters in Watkinsville and Atlanta.\n\nWhether Regions would have purchased The A.I. Group if Obamacare had not been implemented is impossible to know. But once the law went into effect, says A.I. CEO Dave Woodruff, a merger was practically inevitable.\n\n\u201cWhen it was signed into law, it was a seismic shift in the benefits business,\u201d Woodruff told The Oconee Enterprise. \u201cNo longer can small operations do what is needed for their clients of any size. You can\u2019t have a small, two-man or three-man operation and meet the needs, whether the client has under 50 employees, 50 to 100 or up 1,000 or above. If you do not have the resources, you are on the glide plain to irrelevancy.\u201d\n\nWoodruff said that the Affordable Care Act has added layers of complications to his industry.\n\n\u201cThe law itself now has over 36,000 pages of rules and guidance,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are multiple definitions of what is a small employer.\u201d\n\nWoodruff said that many people viewed the implementation of the Affordable Care Act as a disaster, his company treated it like a \u201ctremendous opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were already one of the largest privately held benefits companies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe added 10 to 15 new positions. Since it came through, we have had double-digit revenue growth.\u201d\n\nWoodruff said that employers are craving information and guidance, and his company has strived to meet that demand.\n\nThe A.I. Group was large enough personnel-wise to handle the changes. It has clients in every state. Another insurance professional with personal knowledge of the company told The Oconee Enterprise that The A.I. Group is one of the most respected in the industry.\n\n\u201cWe literally have clients from Miami to Milwaukee, from Long Island to Los Angeles,\u201d said Woodruff. \u201cA substantial portion of our clients are large regional companies. Some are Fortune 500 companies.\u201d\n\nWhereas Regions Insurance is the buyer, Woodruff said that The A.I. Group will be heading up Regions\u2019 Georgia operations.\n\nWoodruff and his partner, Dan Murphy, set some parameters when would-be suitors came calling to expand.\n\nWhereas they were used to talking to three to four interested parties over any typical 60-day period, they decided to weed out the suitors by establishing five criteria that had to exist before they would even chat.\n\nFirst, they wanted a company with a similar culture to The A.I. Group. Woodruff and Murphy were not interested in simply cashing a check. They both want to stay active in the business.\n\nSecond, all of their people had to be able to come with the owners.\n\n\u201cThey have made us what we are,\u201d Woodruff said. \u201cIn a lot of these deals, management gets cut out. Third, we wanted to provide more opportunities for our people who have been with us for 25 years already. We wanted them to have opportunities to grow within the organization.\u201d\n\nWoodruff said The A.I. Group keeps its employees. \u201cWe have people who were interns with us 17 years ago, and they are still with us,\u201d he said.\n\nFourth, they would not talk to anyone who was operating in their existing market segment, which is the mid to large employer. The A.I. Group has moved beyond the small, benefits shop model.\n\nFinally, the philosophy of business was critical. That included like-minded goals for the future.\n\nWoodruff said the reaction to the merger has been excellent. He said 47 employees are staying with the company, including the 15 who work in the Watkinsville office on Julian Drive.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Oconee Enterprise", "description": "The merger of The A.I.
