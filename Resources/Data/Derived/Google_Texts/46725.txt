Animal lovers came out to John Lee Nissan-Mazda in Panama City Saturday for their pet adoption event.

This is the first year, John Lee Nissan-Mazda and the Humane Society of Bay County have teamed up for this event.

Not only were there a number of dogs and cats to adopt, but many residents came out to get their animals vaccinated and micro-chipped.

John Lee representatives say an event like this is a great way to help local non-profits.

"This our first kick off with the Humane Society trying to support that, bring awareness to the community about all the homeless pets that need a home. As well as some of the services offered today which is our low cost micro-chippings as well as vaccinations," said Clay Avedisiam, of John Lee Nissan-Mazda.
