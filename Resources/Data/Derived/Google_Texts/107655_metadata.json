One of them has taken her passion to an unusually visible level.\n\nKara Christian of Denver showed her support of the team with a half-page advertisement on Page 3B in the Saturday Sports section of The Denver Post.\n\nThe ad contains an inspiring message of how the Broncos have helped Christian deal with breast cancer and a resulting terminal prognosis.\n\nShe addresses the ad \u2014 in which she identifies herself only as \u201cThe Bronco Lady\u201d \u2014 to \u201cmy beloved Denver football team.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to make it clear that I did not do this for publicity,\u201d Christian said after being contacted Saturday by The Post. \u201cI did it because I love the team and I want them to know how much they mean to me.\u201d\n\nChristian, 58, has been a Broncos fan since age 5, when the team played its first game in 1960.\n\nShe is close to many Broncos players and coaches. The bond became stronger recently when the team learned of her illness.\n\nThe tie was highlighted last Sunday when Christian was given a field pass for the Broncos\u2019 AFC championship game in Denver and a commemorative football signed by each player on the team.\n\n\u201cYou shall never know how much your kindness and support has meant to me throughout my illness,\u201d Christian said in the ad.\n\n\u201cAn autographed football has made the darkest of days shine brightly with an orange glow. A hug has given me strength to remain Bronco tough. A field pass has given me the encouragement to make it through another day. A phone call has meant the orange and blue world to me.\u201d\n\nBroncos officials were unaware of the ad until they saw it Saturday in the newspaper. They suspected, but weren\u2019t entirely sure, that \u201cThe Bronco Lady\u201d and Christian were one and the same.\n\nTeam spokesman Patrick Smyth showed the ad to Broncos executive vice president John Elway.\n\n\u201cHe just had a big smile on his face,\u201d Smyth said of Elway.\n\nChristian is well known to team personnel and fans as the exuberant South Stands regular with the big orange wig.\n\nShe once tried out to become a Broncos cheerleader \u2014 at the age of 51.\n\nChristian, a retired college professor of exercise physiology, was on the season-ticket waiting list for 10 years before finally landing one in 1996.\n\nFor the next nine years, she was working out of state but came back to attend many games. For games that she couldn\u2019t make \u2014 and before the surge in satellite TV packages \u2014 she instructed friends to send overnight parcels with VHS tapes of the broadcast. She jokingly told her students that she would punish them with failing grades if they disclosed the outcome of the games.\n\nSince returning to Denver in 2005, she has rarely missed a game and typically arrives at the stadium several hours early to greet players as they walk from the team parking lot to the locker room.\n\n\u201cThe best thing they do is give me hugs,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means a lot to me.\u201d\n\nChristian said she qualified for two Super Bowl tickets through the team\u2019s season-ticket lottery and plans to attend next Sunday\u2019s game with friends.\n\n\u201cI think my seats are up high enough where I may need a telescope to see the game,\u201d she joked. \u201cBut we intend to be vocal. I will be supporting my team.\u201d\n\nChristian\u2019s ad concludes: \u201cI was born a Bronco, I bleed orange and I will proudly die a Bronco. GO BRONCOS.\u201d\n\nSteve Raabe: 303-954-1948, sraabe@denverpost.com or twitter.com/steveraabedp\n\nText of Kara Christian\u2019s ad\n\nTO MY BELOVED DENVER FOOTBALL TEAM\n\nDear Teammates: You shall never know how much your kindness and support has meant to me throughout my illness.
