(AP) - Hyde, a black lab, was on his best behavior at the Charles Town City Council meeting when senior patrolman Jason Newlin explained how local Girl Scouts had worked for months to do something special for several area K9 units.\n\nPointing to a badge on the dog\u2019s collar last Monday, Newlin credited Girl Scout Troop 40892 with having been responsible for purchasing it. He also spoke about the special bond that had developed in the last few months as this effort progressed.\n\nLeader Kristen Marino, who has been working with these scouts for six years, credited their good hearts for wanting to do a service project benefiting animals.\n\n\u201cInitially they wanted to walk dogs for people who were unable to do so themselves, so we started researching how to work with dogs - which led us to police K9 units,\u201d she said.\n\nMarino agreed with Newlin that it didn\u2019t take long for the scouts to decide how to move forward, adding, \u201cAfter meeting him and K9 Hyde, the girls knew they wanted to do something special to help the working dogs in Jefferson County.\u201d\n\nWhen they learned the hard-working dogs didn\u2019t have badges, they became determined to change that, she said.\n\n\u201cThe girls learned that these brave dogs have access to quality safety equipment and veterinary care, but, despite being police officers, they did not have police badges of their own,\u201d Marino said.\n\n\u201cSo the girls decided they did need their own badges. They worked hard selling Girl Scout cookies, as well as homemade dog treats and toys, at the Charles Town Farmers Market to raise the funds for these K9 badges,\u201d she said.\n\nTheir collaborative effort has not gone unnoticed by others, Marino said, explaining that the girls received a special award honoring this effort.\n\n\u201cAs Girl Scout Juniors, the girls can earn the Bronze Award, which is the highest honor a Girl Scout can achieve. It consists of a service project that benefits the local community, and it\u2019s recommended that each girl devote at least 20 hours to the project,\u201d she said.\n\nShepherdstown, Harpers Ferry, Berkeley Springs, Shepherd University and the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office received K9 badges as part of this project, Marino said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Journal, http://journal-news.net/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hyde, a black lab, was on his best behavior at the Charles Town City Council meeting when senior patrolman Jason Newlin explained how local Girl Scouts had worked for months to do something special for several area K9 units.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/22/girl-scout-troop-raises-money-for-police-dog-badge/", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "type": "article", "description": "Hyde, a black lab, was on his best behavior at the Charles Town City Council meeting when senior patrolman Jason Newlin explained how local Girl Scouts had worked for months to do something special for several area K9 units.", "title": "Girl Scout troop raises money for police dog badges"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "description": "Hyde, a black lab, was on his best behavior at the Charles Town City Council meeting when senior patrolman Jason Newlin explained how local Girl Scouts had worked for months to do something special fo", "card": "summary", "title": "Girl Scout troop raises money for police dog badges"}, "Author": "JENNI VINCENT", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "\u201cAs Girl Scout Juniors, the girls can earn the Bronze Award, which is the highest honor a Girl Scout can achieve.\nPointing to a badge on the dog\u2019s collar last Monday, Newlin credited Girl Scout Troop 40892 with having been responsible for purchasing it.\nShepherdstown, Harpers Ferry, Berkeley Springs, Shepherd University and the Jefferson County Sheriff\u2019s Office received K9 badges as part of this project, Marino said.\nThey worked hard selling Girl Scout cookies, as well as homemade dog treats and toys, at the Charles Town Farmers Market to raise the funds for these K9 badges,\u201d she said.\nTheir collaborative effort has not gone unnoticed by others, Marino said, explaining that the girls received a special award honoring this effort."}
