Obama instructed federal agencies to \u201c[clarify] the rights of Federal student loan borrowers in bankruptcy\u201d and consider \u201cpossible changes to the treatment of loans in bankruptcy proceedings and when they were borrowed under fraudulent circumstances.\u201d\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWith forty million Americans holding outstanding student loans worth $1.3 trillion, the White House\u2019s proposal is fraught with difficulties.\n\nOn one hand, naive teenagers who signed off their financial futures to leftist, anti-American institutions would catch a break. The college cartel screwed you; now here\u2019s a government waiver to make you forever grateful to the Democrats. The ferocity with which federal agencies pursue cancer patients and even Americans who already paid off their balance is disturbing.\n\nOn the other hand, the mad push to make college \u201caffordable\u201d has led to a relaxation of lending standards that makes the lead-up to the 2008 housing bubble look responsible. Minimal credit checks, no estimate of future earnings, no estimation of the job market four years down the road, and sometimes no co-signer\u2014none of these impede many Americans from getting a loan.\n\nThe damages bankruptcy inflicts on debtors looks appealing to the twenty percent who say they\u2019ll be in debt until they die. Obama\u2019s proposed change could start a run that would greatly increase costs to the federal government and, by extension, taxpayers.\n\nCurrently, in order to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy, a debtor must prove in court they will never be able to afford their monthly payments. That\u2019s difficult to prove even for borrowers like pancreatic cancer victim Stacy Jorgensen, who was told by collectors from the Educational Credit Management Corporation (ECMC) that the \u201cmere possibility of recurrence is not enough\u201d to allow her to discharge her debt as she underwent chemotherapy. (The survival rate for pancreatic cancer hovers between 19 and five percent.)\n\nDemocrats effectively nationalized the student loan industry in 2010 by transferring eight million loans into the federal government\u2019s hands. Republicans claim that higher interest rates students pay on their debts will fund Obamacare to the tune of $8.7 billion, while the mainstream media charges that\u2019s a lie.\n\nRather than reducing federal subsidies to universities and placing the leftist institutions at the mercy of the free market, Obama wants to increase the amount students can borrow with interest from the government. Earlier this year, Obama raised the maximum amount students could borrow in Pell Grants another $1,000. His administration also streamlined the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), making it easier to borrow money from the government\u2014which is also over $18 trillion in debt, a 70 percent increase since Obama took office in 2009. In June 2011, Obama issued an executive order that allowed five million debtors to cap their monthly payments to the government at 10 percent of their income\u2014and see their loans forgiven in 20 years.\n\nObama\u2019s memorandum may encourage more Americans to take on student loan debt instead of deflating the higher education bubble.\n\nEmail Katie at kmchugh@breitbart.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama has ordered the Department of Education to determine whether or not to allow student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama has ordered the Department of Education to determine whether or not to allow student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.", "title": "Obama Considers Allowing Student Loans to be Wiped Out in Bankruptcy", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/obama-wink-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-03-10T18:05:56-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/03/10/obama-considers-allowing-student-loans-to-be-wiped-out-in-bankruptcy/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama has ordered the Department of Education to determine whether or not to allow student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.", "creator": "@k_mcq", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/02/obama-wink-AP.jpg", "title": "Obama Considers Allowing Student Loans to be Wiped Out in Bankruptcy", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "bankruptcy, college tuition, Department of Education, Education, Federal Student Aid, obamacare, Pell Grants, Student Loan Debt,Big Government, Economics, Obama,student loans", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-03-10T18:04:23-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-03-10T18:05:56-07:00", "tag": "Student Loan Debt", "categories": "Big Government,Obama,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Currently, in order to discharge student loan debt in bankruptcy, a debtor must prove in court they will never be able to afford their monthly payments.\nObama\u2019s memorandum may encourage more Americans to take on student loan debt instead of deflating the higher education bubble.\nDemocrats effectively nationalized the student loan industry in 2010 by transferring eight million loans into the federal government\u2019s hands.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERPresident Obama has ordered the Department of Education and its network of federal agencies to determine whether or not to allow student loans to be discharged in bankruptcy proceedings.\nObama instructed federal agencies to \u201c[clarify] the rights of Federal student loan borrowers in bankruptcy\u201d and consider \u201cpossible changes to the treatment of loans in bankruptcy proceedings and when they were borrowed under fraudulent circumstances.\u201dSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERWith forty million Americans holding outstanding student loans worth $1.3 trillion, the White House\u2019s proposal is fraught with difficulties."}
