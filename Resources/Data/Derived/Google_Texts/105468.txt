A North Fort Myers horse arena is increasing its security after several reports of strangers trying to lure teenage girls.

It happened last weekend at the Lee County Posse arena on Palm Creek Drive off Bayshore Road.

The girls say two or three middle-aged men tried to lure them into a van. It put the arena and parents on high alert.

"There was this guy in a white van, and he said 'you all look cute in your outfits,' and he kind of waved at us and told us to come over," said Jaiden Hinman.

Hinman, 13, and her friends were approached by the men, believed to be in their mid-40s, just outside the arena.

"We were scared, and we were just trying to get help," she said.

She said the men approached them in the parking lot across from the arena, but thankfully, the girls had shelter nearby.

"Me and my friend ran to the truck, got inside, locked the doors and started the truck. We are going to drive away if he comes in," Hinman explained.

The same white van also drove by Angela Guinn's daughter on Saturday night.

"She was on her horse. She was going back to unsaddle her, and he told her to come to him and that she looked good on that horse," Guinn said.

"For somebody to go and invade our space, it's uneasy," said Tracey Williams, a mother.

Bobbi Harrison, president of the arena, said they immediately notified the sheriff's office and the families at the track.

"The safety and security of our children is a priority," Harrison said.

She said patrol cars are now driving through the area, and she is also installing security cameras.

"We're going to do every effort we can to stop anybody that has the intention of coming here to do anything to our children," she said.
