That astonishing sum, of course, is the total price Facebook agreed to pay for messaging service WhatsApp and its rapidly growing base of 450 million users. It includes $12 billion in Facebook stock, $4 billion in cash and some $3 billion in restricted stock grants that vest over four years. The Facebook CEO, in the keynote interview at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, called it a bargain.\n\n\u201cI actually just think that, by itself, it\u2019s worth more than $19 billion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to exactly make that case today because they have so little revenue compared to that number, but the reality is there are very few services that reach a billion people in the world, they\u2019re all incredibly valuable \u2013 much more valuable than that.\u201d\n\nRelated: Facebook and WhatsApp Partying Like It\u2019s 1999\n\nZuckerberg could be right, of course. WhatsApp may have had just $20 million in sales last year, but global text messaging revenues for telecom companies totaled $120 billion, according to market researchers at Ovum. WhatsApp and services like it are eating into that market \u2014 and expanding beyond it: WhatsApp just announced plans to add voice calls, threatening to further undercut the business of telecom carriers.\n\nZuckerberg pointed to other messaging apps like KakaoTalk in Korea, Line in Japan and WeChat in China that he said are already monetizing \u201cat a level of $2 to $3 per person with pretty early efforts.\u201d He said, \u201cThat shows that if we can do a pretty good job of helping WhatsApp to grow that this is just going to be a huge business.\u201d\n\nYet analysts and others have struggled to come up with the math to justify the price. Here\u2019s analyst Brian Wieser\u2019s verbatim attempt from right after the announcement was made:\n\n\u201cOn our own (crude) estimates, if we assumed the product had an average of 1bn users next year and added 100mm per year, with 25% of the user base at that time paying $2/year (we would assume many users will simply never pay, shifting devices and/or services as needed, while those who will pay might be willing to pay more than the current $1/year level), we could arrive at $650mm in revenue. $1bn is possible, but given the optimism already incorporated in a $650mm figure, it might seem a stretch.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal\u2019s Dennis K. Berman took another crack at the math, comparing Facebook\u2019s deal to Verizon\u2019s recent $130 billion purchase of Vodafone\u2019s 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless. In that deal, Verizon paid 3.5 times revenue per subscriber. Facebook, based on a hypothetical 50 cents in revenue per WhatsApp subscriber, paid about 84 times. Looking at profit potential, Berman figures it would take $2.84 a year from a billion WhatsApp subscribers to reach a seemingly more sensible valuation on par with Verizon\u2019s acquisition. \u201cIt's still crazy. Just not as crazy as I thought,\u201d Berman concedes.\n\nThat level of revenue per subscriber may be reachable, eventually. But Zuckerberg has also made clear that WhatsApp will be allowed plenty of time \u2013 \u201cfive years or so\u201d \u2013 to focus on growth and \u201cconnecting more people\u201d before it faces pressure to \u201cmonetize.\u201d Until that time comes, the deal still benefits Facebook by keeping a possible competitive threat out of the hands of Google, Microsoft or other rivals.\n\nIn the end, though, Zuckerberg is betting that WhatsApp will keep connecting more and more people and Facebook will ultimately figure out the best way to make money off those users. \u201cI could be wrong,\u201d Zuckerberg said yesterday. \u201cI mean, there is some chance that this is the one service that gets to a billion people and ends up not being that valuable. I don\u2019t think I am.\u201d But, as the 29-year-old CEO well knows, five years in tech is a long, long time.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Facebook CEO said the $19 billion he agreed to pay for WhatsApp is cheap.
