Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., the No. 4 member of the leadership team, also issued a statement defending Boehner.\n\nEarlier this summer, Rep. Mark Meadows presented the strongest challenge to Boehner when he presented a motion to vacate the chair, an extraordinary measure of no confidence in the speaker of the House that hadn\u2019t been used in a century.\n\n>>>Home in North Carolina, Mark Meadows Reflects on Move to Oust John Boehner With \u2018No Regrets\u2019\n\nLawmakers did not vote on the motion at the time.\n\nBut Meadows and other members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus told The Daily Signal that any member could bring up the motion for a vote depending on how Boehner handles upcoming fights in Congress.\n\n\u201cIt is a critical time for our leadership to listen to the American people,\u201d Meadows told The Daily Signal in August.\n\n\u201cIf we have a leadership that becomes responsive, then nothing happens with the resolution. If they are not responsive, the only thing we can change at this particular point is the speaker of the House, and then that certainly is on the table.\u201d\n\nBoehner went along with conservative demands on how to approach the Iran nuclear deal\u2014his first test since Congress returned from recess.\n\nThe House voted on a three-pronged plan meant to challenge President Obama and his negotiating team over \u201cside deals\u201d that opponents allege should have been submitted to Congress.\n\nDemocrats today for the third time blocked a vote on a measure to reject the deal.\n\nUnder the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, today is the final day for Congress to reject the deal, so the agreement will go through.\n\nMeanwhile, Boehner and his leadership team are still deciding how to attack Planned Parenthood.\n\nFreedom Caucus member Rep. John Fleming, R-La., said he is encouraged by House leadership\u2019s handling of the Iran issue\u2014and that the underlying motive of Meadows\u2019 motion is already paying off.\n\n\u201cIf there is any kind of organized effort to replace Boehner based on how he deals with Planned Parenthood, I am totally unaware of it,\u201d Fleming told The Daily Signal today.\n\n\u201cThe plain truth is that Mark offered his motion as a way to create dialogue. And now it sits in the background looking over these decisions. If we continue to disappoint the American people and not fight President Obama\u2019s extreme agenda, than something more serious may happen. But if leadership listens, it reduces the chance of that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "As conservatives weigh whether to challenge House Speaker John Boehner, high-ranking Republicans are sticking by their leader.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As conservatives weigh whether to challenge House Speaker John Boehner, high-ranking Republicans are sticking by their leader.", "title": "House Leaders Defend Boehner's Speakership", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/BoehnerChallenge.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-09-25T12:06:24+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QkLdIC"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "As conservatives weigh whether to challenge House Speaker John Boehner, high-ranking Republicans are sticking by their leader.", "title": "House Leaders Defend Boehner's Speakership", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/BoehnerChallenge.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Featured Topics", "tag": "House of Representatives", "published_time": "2015-09-17T14:35:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-25T12:06:24+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "John Boehner, speaker challenge, Planned Parenthood, government shutdown, funding fight, Iran nuclear deal, Mark Meadows, Kevin McCarthy, Paul Ryan"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc76d\"", "article_summary": "As conservatives weigh whether to challenge House Speaker John Boehner\u2014waiting to see how he handles upcoming fights on Planned Parenthood and the debt ceiling\u2014high-ranking Republicans are sticking by their leader.\nRyan also dismissed conservative attempts to challenge Boehner.\n\u201cIt is a critical time for our leadership to listen to the American people,\u201d Meadows told The Daily Signal in August.\n\u201cThe best person to lead the conference right now is John Boehner, and any attempt to remove him would be counterproductive,\u201d Ryan told Politico.\nMeanwhile, Boehner and his leadership team are still deciding how to attack Planned Parenthood."}
