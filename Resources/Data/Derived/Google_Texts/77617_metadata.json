All 78 patients who reached post-treatment week 12 have also had a sustained response.Side effects were mild, he said.\u201cThe 12-week regimen of LDV/SOF 900mg/400mg has resulted in high SVR rates and is well-tolerated, the authors concluded in their study.At the news conference, Bansal said there were concerns about whether the drugs would cause problems with children\u2019s growth, questions that will take time to answer.But he also said he empathized greatly with mothers of these children, since in almost all cases they transmitted the virus to their teenagers as infants.\u201cThese mothers can feel terrible guilt and want their children treated quickly,\u201d he said in an interview after the conference.He also agreed with colleagues who pointed out that social pressures on both the parents and children are tremendous, once it becomes known that a child has HCV.\u201cSend a kid with HCV to kindergarten and it would be a disaster, said Heiner Wedemeyer, a hepatology professor in Hannover, Germany, \u201cThe other parents would kill you.\u201dBansal said the doses of the drugs used were equivalent to those given to adults.Next he and colleagues plan to enroll children as young as three in a similar trial, a decision made partly because of the safety profile of patients in the study reported today.Hepatits infection in children is a major problem in some regions, he added.The infection rate in adolescents in the US and Europe is 0.4%, but in Egypt it is 6%.\u201cThis is an important treatment,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In what researchers said was the first study of DAAs in children with HCV, UK researchers reported the drugs were effective and well tolerated.
