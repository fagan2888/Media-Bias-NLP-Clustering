Innovation Ohio says it should go to schools and local government. Lawmakers have their own ideas \u2014 across-the-board tax cuts, veterans, workforce development and paying off federal loans for the state unemployment fund.\n\nBut something doesn\u2019t add up. If Ohio expands a program to include more people, where are the savings?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a shell game going on,\u201d Greg Lawson, a policy analyst at the Buckeye Institute, says.\n\nSince the federal government is picking up the tab for all these new people enrolling because of expanded eligibility, Ohio won\u2019t have to pay for them. So, if the state isn\u2019t paying, it must have saved that money \u2013 or freed it up to be spent elsewhere, the argument goes.\n\nBut what about the \u201cwoodwork effect\u201d from the Affordable Care Act, which describes what happens when people who are eligible but not yet enrolled in Medicaid come out of the woodwork to sign up for Medicaid through healthcare.gov?\n\nA policy brief from the Governor\u2019s Office of Health Transformation estimates the cost of the woodwork effect at more than $500 million. It says planned reforms and policy changes will \u201chelp mitigate the $521 million state budget impact \u2026 and ensure the long-term financial stability of the Medicaid program.\u201d\n\nThe October enrollment numbers for Ohio showed 57 percent of people who registered under healthCare.gov is, in part, attributed to the woodwork effect.\n\nIn February, Greg Moody, director of the Health Transformation Office, told the House Finance and Appropriations Committee the $404 million would come from policy modifications such as moving prisoners onto Medicaid and reducing state payments to hospitals.\n\nBut some of those expansion savings are from the same reforms meant to offset the woodwork effect.\n\nIn the end, the $404 million isn\u2019t savings, Lawson said. Some is new revenue from sales taxes and other health insurance taxes included in the ACA. The shell game comes from shifting expenses, such as prisoner health care, from one part of the state budget onto the Medicaid budget, where the federal government pays more than half the costs, he said.\n\nMatt Mayer, president of Opportunity Ohio, says the cost shifting is more dramatic.\n\n\u201cAbout $1 billion in state funds were being cut from hospitals in the budget, but the expansion would replace the cuts the hospitals got by giving them new customers,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cThis is why the hospitals went for the Medicaid expansion. They understood what Kasich was proposing and realized they needed the federal funds they\u2019d be getting.\u201d\n\nUnbeknownst to most lawmakers, earlier in the year Gov. John Kasich applied for and received approval from the Department of Health and Human Services to expand Medicaid.\n\n\u201cThis was the way he was going to play the game,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cHe got the HHS waiver approved. The controlling board needed to accept the federal funds because, if not, the state would have to foot the bill for the additional people.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was threatening lawmakers by saying, \u2018I\u2019ve done it and if you don\u2019t get us the additional federal funds, we\u2019ll blow through the (state) funds quicker and then you\u2019ll have to deal with a bankrupt system,\u2019\u201d he added.\n\nThe board accepted the federal money, but several members of the General Assembly filed suit to stop the expansion.\n\nMayer said taxpayers don\u2019t stand a chance.\n\n\u201cThe House and Senate turned down his budget, fought against Medicaid expansion, fought against the severance tax ,and now Kasich is going to end up getting everything he wanted,\u201d he said.\n\nLawmakers recently introduced House Bill 375, a modified severance tax increase bill that has the support of the oil and gas industry.\n\n\u201cIn the long run, government spending has gone up more under Kasich than any other governor,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cKasich believes in the \u2018starve the beast\u2019 approach \u2013 that cutting taxes results in forcing government to shrink. Unfortunately, history shows the beast never starves. Other sources of revenue are found to continue the feeding. At the end of the day, Kasich has not reduced government spending at all.\u201d\n\nLawson agrees, especially when it comes to Medicaid. \u201cThe state may call the $404 million \u2018savings,\u2019\u201d he said, \u201cbut the overall cost is still increasing.\u201d\n\nState budget documents project a 7.9 percent increase in Medicaid costs in fiscal 2013; 3.9 percent in 2014.\n\nAmy Hanauer, executive director of Policy Matters Ohio, said taking care of people who need health care should be a priority, and the state is optimistic it can control Medicaid costs.\n\n\u201cOur point is that there are unmet needs that are not included in the state budget, and another tax cut would be the worst possible use of those funds,\u201d she said.\n\nBut in three years most of the $404 million goes away, Mayer said, and the spending will still be there.\n\n\u201cThen what?\u201d he asked.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Will Ohio really see savings from a Medicaid expansion or is it all just a budgetary shell game?", "title": "Is OH playing shell game with Medicaid money? - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/12/Greg-Lawson-Buckeye-Institute-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-12-09T12:02:28+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/119347/ohio-medicaid-expansion/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "News", "tag": "Gov.
