CSTE's findings on the plight of seminary graduates regarding debt can be found in similar research within the United Methodist Church.\n\nAllyson Collinsworth, executive director of the United Methodist Board of Higher Education and Ministry's Office of Loans and Scholarships, told The Christian Post that \"seminarian debt is a serious problem for the church and one that can't be addressed by seminaries alone.\"\n\n\"It has to be addressed by the whole denomination, undergraduate institutions, local churches, and the students themselves, as well as the seminaries,\" said Collinsworth.\n\n\"Our own survey of UMC seminaries last year found that an estimated 60 percent to 75 percent of candidates for ordained ministry in the UMC have educational debt averaging between $26,513 and $34,782.\"\n\nCollinsworth also told CP that there was an \"advisory group\" that met last week to investigate the issue and will \"make recommendations in a report to General Conference 2016.\"\n\nAnother finding in the CSTE study was that two-thirds of seminary graduates surveyed said they would have borrowed less money if they could have done it again.\n\nBriggs reported that efforts to make seminary more affordable included the Lilly Endowment Inc. providing $12.3 million for 51 theological schools to aid the finances of both schools and students, reported Briggs.\n\n\"The grants will allow the schools among other activities to examine new models for financing theological education, explore ways to reduce the number of hours required for degrees, broaden sources of scholarships and financial aid and create programs to improve the financial literacy of students,\" wrote Briggs.\n\nCollinsworth of UMC told CP about the efforts over the past few years by her denomination \"to take steps to alleviate debt.\"\n\n\"In 2006, we used earnings from our student loans to endow a Special Seminary Scholarship Fund that provides scholarships for seminarians under age 30 who plan to be ordained in the UMC,\" said Collinsworth.\n\n\"Also, the UMC has a churchwide fund that raises money for seminaries and annual conferences (the local jurisdictions of the church). The Ministerial Education Fund sent $14.4 million in 2013 to the 13 United Methodist seminaries.\"", "article_metadata": {"Description": "A large number of seminary graduates are dealing with overwhelming debt upon graduation, according to a new study by a research organization connected to Auburn Theological Seminary.", "Copyright": "2016 Christian Post", "Title": "Seminary Graduates in Record Debt, Study Finds", "og": {"site_name": "Christian Post", "description": "A large number of seminary graduates are dealing with overwhelming debt upon graduation, according to a new study by a research organization connected to Auburn Theological Seminary.", "title": "Seminary Graduates in Record Debt, Study Finds", "url": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/seminary-graduates-in-record-debt-study-finds-117676/", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/52785/seminary.jpg", "author": "Michael Gryboski", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ChristianPost", "image": "http://images.christianpost.com/full/52785/seminary.jpg", "description": "A large number of seminary graduates are dealing with overwhelming debt upon graduation, according to a new study by a research organization connected to Auburn Theological Seminary.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Seminary Graduates in Record Debt, Study Finds"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.christianpost.com/news/seminary-graduates-in-record-debt-study-finds-117676/", "robots": "index, follow", "bt": {"keywords": "Auburn&20Seminary,Auburn,United&20Methodist&20Church,Presbyterians,seminaries,school,education,costs,loans,scholarship,borrowing,finance,debts,debt,student&20loans,divinity,degree,classes,christian&20news,christianity,evangelical", "pubDate": "2014-04-09T15:01:19-04:00", "modDate": "2014-04-09T15:01:19-04:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "29BD7F6D752EB52F5F8F8ACEF4AC6689", "fb": {"page_id": 41093998634, "app_id": 968308226558745}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Auburn Seminary, Auburn, United Methodist Church, Presbyterians, seminaries, school, education, costs, loans, scholarship, borrowing, finance, debts, debt, student loans, divinity, degree, classes,christian news,christianity,evangelical", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb730\"", "article_summary": "CSTE's findings on the plight of seminary graduates regarding debt can be found in similar research within the United Methodist Church.\nAnother finding in the CSTE study was that two-thirds of seminary graduates surveyed said they would have borrowed less money if they could have done it again.\nThe CSTE found that among 2011 graduates there was record debt, according to David Briggs of Presbyterian News Service.\nFree Sign Up CP Newsletter, Christian Post Reporter By Michael Gryboski Christian Post ReporterA large number of seminary graduates are dealing with overwhelming debt upon graduation, according to a new study by a research organization connected to Auburn Theological Seminary.\nCollinsworth of UMC told CP about the efforts over the past few years by her denomination \"to take steps to alleviate debt.\""}
