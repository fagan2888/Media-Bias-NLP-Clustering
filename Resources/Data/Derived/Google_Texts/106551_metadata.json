Because they do not have the same regulatory oversight as banks, some of these lenders can provide more leverage for transactions, enabling buyers to pay more for businesses.\n\nFor example, if a firm is willing to pay 10 times Ebitda for a business, and can get up to 6-times leverage from a traditional bank, but had an alternative lender that would provide 7- or 7.5-times leverage, that firm could increase the Ebitda multiple it is paying to maybe 10.5- or 11-times leverage, potentially winning the deal.\n\n\u0093The frothiness of the leverage markets is contributing to higher purchase-price multiples,\u0094 says Lawson. \u0093People keep one-upping each other.\u0094\n\nLower middle-market private equity firm Striker Partners rarely uses leverage in deals, according to Derek Spence. In today\u0092s M&A climate, that puts the firm at a disadvantage. For example, a firm that would put two turns of leverage on a deal, and then still pay a 6-times Ebitda multiple, could win a transaction with an 8-times multiple, while Striker would be coming in with an offer of 6-times leverage.\n\n\u0093We\u0092ll get blown out of a few of them but our goal is to find the opportunity where a partnership is more important than the almighty dollar,\u0094 Spence says.
