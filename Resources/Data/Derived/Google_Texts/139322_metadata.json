This movement has caused other public figures to jump on board to help raise awareness to combat the stigmas associated with seeking treatment. Advocating for mental health awareness is a mindset that we all should aspire to follow.\n\nAlthough mental health awareness month is officially over, we must be diligent throughout the year in creating awareness on mental illness. Mental health stigmas are a real problem, and they still exist all over the world. In America alone, there are about 8 million people suffering from severe mental illnesses and only around half of those are treated.\n\nBut why should we fight these mental health stigmas?\n\nFear of discrimination and the attached stigmas often keep sufferers and their families from facing their mental health problems. This deters them from seeking help, which is very problematic. Mental health is just as important as physical health. Additionally, access to mental health treatment and insurance coverage can also be a barrier to seeking treatment. Mental health treatment should be viewed similarly to how physical ailments are addressed because the two are often times entwined.\n\nFortunately, as awareness of mental health issues spreads and stigmas recede, more and more medical professionals are choosing careers in mental health. We are learning more about the benefits of helping people care for their mental health, including longer life expectancy, increased productivity, improved financial stability, and happier personal lives. As a result, public and private organizations are recognizing the importance of providing access to affordable mental health care. In the U.S., this progress is evident in the inclusion of mental health care coverage requirements in the Affordable Care Act.

If someone refers to a person with a mental illness as \u2018crazy\u2019 or \u2018insane\u2019 it is completely justifiable to point out that it is not alright to use such shaming language. It is important to question how using those kinds of harsh words can segue into negativity and generalizations that are frankly not true.\n\nOnline communities such as BringChange2Mind and StigmaFighters offer those struggling with mental problems a judgment-free outlet for taking the steps towards acceptance of themselves and overall wellness. Although May is over, advocating for mental health equality must remain a top priority. We all deserve to live happily and feel healthy.\n\nBe a voice of reason by advocating mental health all year-long and you will make the world a much better place for literally millions.\n\nMental Health Advocacy Must Remain A Top Priority was last modified: by", "article_metadata": {"description": "Although mental health awareness month is officially over, we must be diligent throughout the year in creating awareness on mental illness.", "og": {"site_name": "Social Work Helper", "description": "As of 2013, May is officially mental health month\u00a0which\u00a0was set in motion by President Obama, and it has made a huge impact in only a couple of years.
