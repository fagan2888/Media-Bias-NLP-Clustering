Lawmakers, most of them Republican, have steadfastly rejected policies to stimulate the economy and Federal Reserve officials have been trying to convince everyone, including themselves, that the economy is reliably on the upswing.\n\nIt\u2019s not. Even before the wipeout in 2008, most Americans were treading water economically, or sinking, though their predicament was obscured by high levels of debt. Since then, growth has been lopsided, with virtually all of the income and wealth accruing to those at the top of the economic ladder.\n\nLittle has been done to counter that dynamic \u2013 Obamacare is a notable exception because health coverage reduces the threat of job loss and bankruptcy from poor health. But most policymaking, or lack thereof \u2014 including big and untimely federal budget cuts coupled with the continued erosion of labor standards \u2014 has reinforced lopsided growth.\n\nIt\u2019s a wonder the economy has been as resilient as it has been. But given its structural inequality, it should come as no surprise when it falters and fails, time and again, to gain real momentum.\n\nThe stock market dive this week was chalked up to falling oil prices and lackluster retail sales. Low oil prices are a bad sign of economic weakness, but on the positive side, they were expected to free up money in family budgets for more spending. What appears to have happened instead is that freed-up cash has gone mostly to cover rising rents and other non-retail essentials, or, maybe, into savings. The pace of retail spending has actually been trending down for about a year and more rapidly of late. Why? Because the pace of job growth has been slowing and when that happens, spending tends to slow as well. And when spending is slow, especially around the holidays, job growth also tends to slow, and so on.\n\nRising prosperity for the few means undue hardship for the many. That is the economy\u2019s underlying problem and it won\u2019t be solved until policymakers face up to it.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20151114110019, "BN": "takingnote", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "takingnote", "DISPLAYDATE": "November 14, 2015", "keywords": "Credit and Debt,Income Inequality,Labor and Jobs,Oil (Petroleum) and Gasoline,Shopping and Retail,United States Economy,United States,Featured Posts", "GBLC": "Featured Posts", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/takingnote/The Real Problem With the Economy ( 20151114 )", "description": "The slumping stock market this week is a blip.
