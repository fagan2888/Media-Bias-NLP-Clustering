MINNEAPOLIS — Kobe Bryant has reached rarefied air.

The Los Angeles Lakers star passed Michael Jordan for third on the NBA’s career scoring list Sunday night.

Bryant entered the game against the Minnesota Timberwolves needing nine points to pass the icon with whom he is often compared. He got the mark with two free throws with 5:24 to play in the second quarter.

Now only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone have scored more points than Bryant.

The Timberwolves stopped the game, and a Lakers-heavy crowd gave Bryant a standing ovation as Wolves owner Glen Taylor presented him with the game ball. Bryant received a standing ovation and hugs from teammates and the Timberwolves.
