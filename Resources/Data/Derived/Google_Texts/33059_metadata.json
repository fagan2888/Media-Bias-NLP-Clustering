This was a great group of seniors.\u201d\n\nThe game matched 3A\u2019s most potent offense against its stingiest defense. The Titans led the class with 100 goals entering the game, while Colorado Academy allowed just two goals.\n\nOffense prevailed early as the Titans broke through with a goal by freshman Titus Grant in the fourth minute to give TCA the early lead. A minute later, Colorado Academy senior Robert Wright responded to tie the game. In the 10th minute, Wright added a second goal to make it 2-1.\n\n\u201cThroughout this entire season, we had trouble scoring the ball. Our defense has really held us in these games,\u201d Wright said. We have a fantastic goalkeeper in Jack Thomas so we felt this was our time to bring some goals to the table and we were able to capitalize.\u201d\n\nThe Mustangs kept up the pressure through the first, getting 10 shots on goal and another goal from JJ Meyers in the 23rd minute to make it 3-1 going into the half.\n\nIn the second, the Titans made adjustments and were able to create more opportunities. Grant scored his second goal of the game in the 53rd minute to cut Colorado Academy\u2019s lead down to one.\n\n\u201cWe knew they were going to be a really organized team, so it was primarily our focus to attack smartly and throw them out of their organization,\u201d Titans coach Blake Galvin said. \u201cI think we had moments where we were able to do that very well. The unfortunate thing was that we were unable to keep that up for a full 80 minutes.\u201d\n\nA late goal by Mustangs midfielder Alex Clinkscales brought the lead back to two and put the game away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. I can\u2019t put words to it,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve lost, so I was thinking how horrible it would be to go out on that note.\u201d\n\nJoe Nguyen: jnguyen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/byjoenguyen", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado Academy repeats as Class 3A boys soccer champs", "title": "Colorado Academy repeats as Class 3A boys soccer champs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/09/colorado-academy-repeats-as-class-3a-boys-soccer-champs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131109_040754_colorado-academy-tca.jpg", "height": 447}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131109_040754_colorado-academy-tca.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-09T16:00:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T12:15:05+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8018\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt was a special day for these boys, a really special day for Colorado Academy,\u201d Mustangs coach Gabe Bernstein said.\nThe Titans led the class with 100 goals entering the game, while Colorado Academy allowed just two goals.\nCOMMERCE CITY \u2014 Colorado Academy caps off its second straight undefeated season with a 4-2 win over No.\n3 The Classical Academy for the Class 3A state boys soccer title Saturday at Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods Park.\nGrant scored his second goal of the game in the 53rd minute to cut Colorado Academy\u2019s lead down to one."}
