He has led the health-care system through unprecedented growth for the past 13 years. (Photo: Provided by IU Health.)\n\nIndiana University Health head Daniel Evans announced Tuesday that he plans to retire as the leader of the state\u2019s largest health system, which he helped expand from three hospitals in Downtown Indianapolis to nearly 20 facilities around the state.\n\nWhen Evans steps down as president and chief executive officer next May, Dennis Murphy, IU Health\u2019s executive vice president and chief operating officer, will step into that role. Murphy will become president in Evans\u2019s stead immediately.\n\nSince taking the top post at what was then Clarian Health Partners 13 years ago, Evans oversaw unprecedented growth during a rocky period for the health-care industry, which weathered both the Great Recession and health reform. Revenue grew during that period from about $850 million to nearly $6 billion.\n\n\u201cI think Dan is going to go down as legendary,\u201d said Douglas Leonard, president of the Indiana Hospital Association, noting that Evans, who also has been a tireless advocate for patient safety, helped catapult IU Health to a place of national prominence.\n\nIU Health continues to transform. Recently, it announced plans to replace its aging Downtown facilities with a $1 billion academic health center that will mesh better with a future health-care system that places as much emphasis on preventing disease as on treating it. There\u2019s also a less elaborate project in the works for Bloomington.\n\nStill, Evans said Tuesday, the time has come for him to step down, adding that he had always intended to retire in his mid to late 60s. He will be 67 next April.\n\n\u201cThere will always be something on the horizon. If not now, when,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the early years of Evans\u2019 tenure, he faced the challenge of unifying the staffs from two hospitals \u2014 University and Methodist. As the hospital system started acquiring more facilities around the state, it changed its name to IU Health in 2011 in an attempt to emphasize its ties with the university and increase its national prominence.\n\nFour years later, few would dispute the success of the IU Health brand.\n\nAnd many see that that brand as synonymous with Evans.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a larger-than-life guy,\u201d said David Johnson, president and chief executive of BioCrossroads, who has known Evans since 1987, when both were attorneys with Baker and Daniels. \u201cHe\u2019s somebody who has always known everyone, been fearless about being involved in things and has really drawn on those relationships. I think some of the visibility of IU Health under Dan Evans is part of Dan Evans\u2019 visibility himself.\u201d\n\nReplacing Evans may not prove easy, but both Johnson and Leonard said IU Health did the right thing developing a long-term transition plan. Both also praised Murphy for his health-care acumen.\n\nMurphy will remain in the chief operating officer position until a successor if found.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really admirable to see an organization like that design a succession plan, so it will have a seamless impact on the organization ... instead of going out shopping and making a bet on a stranger to come in,\u201d Leonard said.\n\nTwo years ago when Murphy joined IU Health from Northwestern Memorial HealthCare in Chicago, both he and Evans discussed the possibility that he might one day succeed him.\n\nUnlike Evans who came to the job with little professional background in health care \u2014 he was an equity partner at Baker and Daniels \u2014 Murphy, 51, brings years of experience in health-care management to the job.\n\nMurphy, who holds an undergraduate degree from the University of Notre Dame, earned a master\u2019s degree in health-care administration from Duke University. He spent 10 years at Johns Hopkins Hospital before his time in Chicago. While in Chicago, he helped open a 328-bed, $507 million women\u2019s hospital.\n\nFor most of his lcareer, Murphy said, he has been a clinical operations expert. This new position will allow him to tap into different skills.\n\n\u201cI spend my days making sure trains run on time as my primary role,\u201d he said. \u201cThis job appropriately allows me to grow much more into a strategic leadership capacity.\u201d\n\nFor Evans, Methodist Hospital was a part of his life from the start. He likes to tell people he was born there. His father served as the chair of the hospital\u2019s board in the mid-\u201960s. As a young adult, Evans helped raise money for a new building, one that still stands on Senate Avenue.\n\nIU Methodist Hospital (pictured) has long been a cornerstone of IU Health, which has grown from three Downtown Indianapolis hospitals to nearly 20 health-care facilities statewide. (Photo: Photo provided by IU Health.)\n\nBefore he became CEO, Evans served as chairman of the board and spent three months serving as interim CEO, when he persuaded fellow board members he was the right man for the job.\n\nDespite his previous experience, nothing prepared him for his new role, he said.\n\n\u201cThe biggest surprise to me ... was there is nothing simple about the delivery of health care,\u201d Evans said. \u201cIf one can\u2019t manage the ambiguities and complexity, one shouldn\u2019t be a health executive in the 21st century.\u201d\n\nThen came the Great Recession and the Affordable Care Act, as well as two ensuing Supreme Court cases, that put the whole health-care industry on edge. During his tenure, Evans helped move the hospitals and Indiana University\u2019s many health schools, from medicine to optometry to social work, closer together. Meanwhile, he found himself overseeing an increasing number of hospitals stretched across a growing geographic area.\n\n\u201cManaging that stress for the past six years has been the No. 1 challenge,\u201d Evans said.\n\nNow, IU Health turns to the next chapter, planning for the future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one of the biggest and bigger doesn\u2019t necessarily mean better,\u201d Evans said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to embrace the future. ... The future isn\u2019t about hospitals. It\u2019s about well-organized systems of care.\u201d\n\nBut in order to achieve that, IU Health will have to transform its two adult hospitals in Downtown Indianapolis, which could wind up angering some.\n\n\u201cThe real key is actually convincing people that we\u2019re not closing one hospital or another, but we\u2019re actually creating a new environment,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWe\u2019re really creating a new model of care to be successful in what we know is a rapidly changing environment.\u201d\n\nWhile Murphy plans for the future, Evans said he still has not decided exactly what retirement will hold. He intends to remain active and involved in the Indianapolis community. Formerly active in Republican politics, he would not rule out a run for office but said it was not likely.\n\nGolf will almost definitely be involved.\n\nSaturday, Evans said, he got his first-ever hole-in-one and thought about retiring right then. But the caddy told him he had to play out 18 rounds. And so he continued to finish the game.\n\nCall Star reporter Shari Rudavsky at (317) 444-6354.
