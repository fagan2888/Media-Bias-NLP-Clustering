This requires facing important truths about energy policies.\n\nI doubt many of us are willing to give up our cars, houses, cell phones or all the other goods we are accustomed to. We owe our quality of life in part to the efficient, safe and affordable energy source of oil and gas. We must realistically acknowledge that oil and gas offer low risk options:\n\n1) Fracking has been done safely for over 60 years. It is also highly regulated by federal, state and local agencies. Fracking uses less than one-tenth of one percent of the Colorado's water and occurs a mile below the state's underground water table. Our state's water and air quality improve each year thanks to our tough regulations.\n\n2) It has brought our nation to near energy-independence/security.\n\n3) It also produces natural gas \u2014 the broad consensus for the best choice in improving air quality today.\n\nColorado has passed some of the strongest air quality standards in the country and is held up by many as \"state of the art.\" Yet I hear folks furious about how supposedly terrible oil/gas/fracking is without acknowledging the low risks and big benefits to our society.\n\nThe reliability of renewables like wind and solar does not yet meet prevailing energy demands. Wind and solar combined can provide only about 9 percent of U.S. energy demand today. This doesn't mean we abandon alternative energy, it just means we need to be realistic about the greater good and the mitigated risks of oil and gas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe must recognize the tremendous advantages the oil and gas industry brings to our society, including lower-priced goods, heating bills and fuel prices. We must have common sense conversations on our energy policies.\n\nStacey Alexander lives in Erie.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.dailycamera.com/guest-opinions/ci_27667616/stacey-alexander-facing-important-energy-truths", "sailthru.author": "By Stacey Alexander", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:27667616:view"}, "startDate": "2015-03-07T18:43:40-0700", "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "When it comes to energy production, most will agree we need efficient, safe, affordable energy.
