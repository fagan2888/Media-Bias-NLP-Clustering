Ridgeland will soon have a new police chief.



The Mayor and Board of Aldermen on Tuesday unanimously approved Randy Tyler as chief effective July 25.



Tyler, who is currently assistant police chief, brings 30 years of law enforcement experience to the position, city officials said. He began working for the Ridgeland Police Department in 1987, and served as interim police chief for several months in 2011.



"I am pleased to see this important leadership position filled with such a qualified individual," said Mayor Gene McGee. "I look forward to working with him to continue to make Ridgeland one of the safest places to live and work."

Tyler will replace Jimmy Houston, who announced in May that he was resigning effective July 24.



Houston plans to teach criminal justice at Holmes Community College in Ridgeland.
