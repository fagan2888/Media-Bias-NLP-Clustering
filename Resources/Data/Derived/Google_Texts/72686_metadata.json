He credited his teammates and the organization for helping him win the honor.\n\n\u201cYou kind of have a speech in your head, but you never know\u201d if he was going to need it, MacKinnon said. \u201cYou don\u2019t really get to enjoy it, because you\u2019re thinking: \u2018Oh, crap. I have to go talk in front of all those people.'\u201d\n\nRyan O\u2019Reilly, who won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for the player who best exemplified a high level of play with sportsmanship, offered no new details on his contract situation.\n\n\u201cIt is what it is, the business part,\u201d he said. \u201cThis summer, we\u2019ll go through it, and it should resolve sometime soon.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly was penalized only two minutes the entire season, assessed after he played the puck with a broken stick in his 72nd game of the season.\n\nWinning the award was a mixture of luck \u2014 including a few times he said he should have been tagged with a penalty \u2014 and the influence of his parents, who had encouraged him early on to play hickey intensely and with passion while respecting other players.\n\n\u201cThey said to me they were very proud,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cTo win this is a tribute to them for everything they showed me, and I\u2019m proud to be their son.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly said the three awards were a credit to the change in culture from management and first-year coach Patrick Roy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve changed the culture ,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said, \u201cwith everything the management has done, with (Patrick) changing the team and Nate (MacKinnon) coming in and being the huge factor he was. I think people are noticing that. We\u2019re a team that competes, and we\u2019re going to have a good chance at winning.\n\n\u201cGoing to the awards and being around the top players in the game, I feel like I can be a bigger factor and contribute more. It\u2019s a confidence booster.\u201d\n\nRoy, who won the Jack Adams Award for NHL coach of the year, was not present for the media, nor was Avs goaltender Semyon Varlamov, who finished second for the Vezina Trophy voting for the top goaltender. Roy was the first coach to claim the Jack Adams Award in his first NHL season behind the bench since Washington\u2019s Bruce Boudreau in 2008.\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda1b1\"", "article_summary": "The Avalanche walked away with three of the four individual NHL awards it was nominated for in Las Vegas, but that was so 24 hours ago.\nRoy was the first coach to claim the Jack Adams Award in his first NHL season behind the bench since Washington\u2019s Bruce Boudreau in 2008.\n\u201cIt was something I wanted to receive,\u201d MacKinnon said Wednesday at the Pepsi Center of winning the Calder Trophy for NHL rookie of the year.\nNathan MacKinnon is already back to training for next season \u2014 and looking for a bigger trophy.\n\u201cYou kind of have a speech in your head, but you never know\u201d if he was going to need it, MacKinnon said."}
