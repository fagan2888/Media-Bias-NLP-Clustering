In the survey, 52 percent of respondents said Obama was not honest, while only 44 percent said he was, a striking change from January 2011, when nearly two thirds of voters trusted the president.\n\nAlso worrisome for Obama, that sentiment extended across different demographics. Six in ten independents said they no longer trusted the president, while majorities in every age bracket \u2014 including the 18-to-29-year-olds who have long been Obama's most ardent supporters \u2014 said the president wasn't trustworthy.\n\nObama's approval rating, meanwhile, slipped to an all-time low of 39 percent.\n\nIt's a stunning reversal for a president who, even when voters didn't like how he was running the White House, still came off as an honest steward. During the government shutdown, for instance, polls found that voters were far more willing to trust Obama than his GOP rivals. And in October, voters believed the president was honest by a 54-41 split, per Quinnipiac, numbers that Mitt Romney would have killed for.\n\nYet ObamaCare's terrible rollout has greatly eroded that invaluable asset, possibly taking with it some of the president's leverage to negotiate with Congress in looming battles on immigration and the budget.\n\nBy all accounts, the debut of ObamaCare's online exchange marketplace, a central piece of the overall health-care law, was a disaster. As a result, six in 10 voters now say they don't approve of how Obama has handled health care, according to Quinnipiac.\n\nThe bigger blow to Obama's credibility, though, came when insurance companies began dropping coverage for thousands of Americans because their existing health-insurance plans did not meet ObamaCare's more rigorous standards. Obama famously (and repeatedly) vowed that people who liked their insurance plans could keep them.\n\nThe Washington Post's resident fact-checker, Glenn Kessler, gave Obama four Pinocchios \u2014 denoting the biggest possible fib \u2014 for his vow that no one would lose insurance they liked.\n\n\"The president's promise apparently came with a very large caveat,\" he wrote. \"'If you like your health-care plan, you'll be able to keep your health-care plan \u2014 if we deem it to be adequate.'\"\n\nFurther, while ObamaCare is expected to drive down premiums in the insurance market as a whole, some Americans will actually see their out-of-pocket costs rise. That would, to some, appear to contradict Obama's claims that the health-care law would lead to big savings.\n\nPerhaps as a result of such revelations, only 19 percent of respondents in the Quinnipiac poll said the quality of their health care would improve thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Forty-three percent, on the other hand, said the quality of their care would get worse.\n\nSome Democrats \u2014 especially those with potentially difficult re-election campaigns next year \u2014 have begun to ding Obama for the apparent contradictions.\n\nRep. Kurt Schrader (D-Ore.) charged the president over the weekend with \"grossly misleading the American public.\" And even Bill Clinton, though hardly Obama's closest political ally, took a swipe at him, saying he \"should honor the commitment the federal government made to these people and let them keep what they got.\"\n\nFeeling the heat, the president himself took the unusual step last week of issuing a public apology, saying in an interview with NBC, \"I am sorry that [people who have lost coverage] are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me.\"\n\nIf voters don't come back around on the president, it could seriously hinder Obama's ability to wield the bully pulpit and score the big policy wins he's eyeing for the remainder of his term. Getting ObamaCare running smoothly \u2014 and soon \u2014 would be a big step in that direction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Official site of The Week Magazine, offering commentary and analysis of the day's breaking news and current events as well as arts, entertainment, people and gossip, and political cartoons.", "og": {"url": "http://theweek.com/articles/456624/obamas-honesty-problem-how-president-lost-biggest-political-asset", "image": "http://api.theweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/tw_image_9_4/public/54604_article_full.jpg?itok=RSlpgBpq", "type": "article", "description": "For the first time, a majority of Americans think Obama is not honest and trustworthy", "title": "Obama's honesty problem: How the president lost his biggest political asset"}, "twitter": {"description": "For the first time, a majority of Americans think Obama is not honest and trustworthy", "title": "Obama's honesty problem: How the president lost his biggest political asset", "image": {"src": "http://api.theweek.com/sites/default/files/styles/tw_image_9_4/public/54604_article_full.jpg?itok=RSlpgBpq"}, "creator": "@jonterbush", "site": "@theweek", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 10716057521}, "keywords": "feature, Politics", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-13T06:05:00-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd82a\"", "article_summary": "ADVERTISEMENTAs the government shutdown came to a close last month, President Obama said Washington would have to \"earn back the trust of the American people.\"\nAnd in October, voters believed the president was honest by a 54-41 split, per Quinnipiac, numbers that Mitt Romney would have killed for.\nThe president apparently has a lot of work to do on that front as well.\nIt's a stunning reversal for a president who, even when voters didn't like how he was running the White House, still came off as an honest steward.\nSix in ten independents said they no longer trusted the president, while majorities in every age bracket \u2014 including the 18-to-29-year-olds who have long been Obama's most ardent supporters \u2014 said the president wasn't trustworthy."}
