Jerry Brown on Friday signed California\u2019s $108 billion budget for the coming fiscal year that pays down debt, builds a rainy day fund and provides additional money for schools and health care.\n\nBrown signed the budget in a crowded, sparsely furnished press room at San Diego City Hall, flanked by lawmakers including Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins, a Democrat from San Diego.\n\n\u201cCalifornia is demonstrating that the majority can actually govern, unlike Washington, which is mired in gridlock and partisanship and extreme polarization,\u201d Brown said, adding that Democrats had \u201ca lot of cooperation from the minority party as well.\u201d\n\nBrown said the budget lowers debt, invests in public schools, shores up the teachers\u2019 pension fund and guards against another economic downturn. He said he doesn\u2019t anticipate tapping the rainy day fund while in office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly going to be untouchable for the next 4\u00bd years if the election turns out as I think it will,\u201d he said, alluding to his re-election bid.\n\nRepublican gubernatorial candidate Neel Kashkari said Brown\u2019s budget represents more of the same back-room dealing in Sacramento.\n\n\u201cDespite the nation\u2019s highest poverty rate and a failing education system, Gov. Jerry Brown today signed the largest budget in state history that is nothing more than a giveaway for special interests paid for by working families,\u201d Kashkari said in a statement.\n\nThe budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1 is built on temporary tax increases and surging revenue from the booming stock market.\n\nRepublican lawmakers called the 2014-15 fiscal year spending plan a mixed bag. They praised the use of a more conservative revenue projection while criticizing spending on permanent programs that they say could be difficult to maintain once temporary, voter-approved tax increases expire in a few years.\n\nHere is where the money is directed:\n\n\u2014 Lawmakers agreed to Brown\u2019s plan to set aside $1.6 billion for the state\u2019s rainy day fund and approved companion legislation to start reducing $74 billion in unfunded teacher pension liabilities.\n\n\u2014 Spends $264 million for free preschool and day care for low-income families. The preschool program eventually will serve half of all 4-year-olds in the state, about 234,000 children.\n\n\u2014 Increases the maximum aid allowed under California\u2019s welfare-to-work program, CalWORKS, by 5 percent starting next April.\n\n\u2014 Includes $1 billion to cover higher-than-expected Medi-Cal enrollment rates as part of the federal Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\n\u2014 Relatives and workers who care for the elderly and people with disabilities outside of nursing homes will be entitled to overtime pay.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2014 Gives $250 million this year and a quarter of future revenues from California\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions law to the $68 billion high-speed rail project.\n\nDespite broad authority to veto items in the budget, Brown issued just a handful of changes mainly to clean up legislation.\n\nHe reduced by half the state staffing responsible for making sure insurance plans provide mental health coverage at the same level as medical conditions to save $2.5 million. He removed $700,000 for a teen driver safety study because the program is already underway.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Judy Lin in Sacramento contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "SAN DIEGO >> Gov.
