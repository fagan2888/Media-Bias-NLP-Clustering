Further, the Kremlin alleged that Erdogan and his family are personally involved.\n\nThe Turkish president angrily denied all the accusations, but on Thursday Putin repeated them, with the additional suggestion that Erdogan and other Turkish leaders were being subjected to some sort of divine punishment that has impaired their judgment.\n\nSpeaking of the decision to shoot down the plane, which resulted in the death of one of its pilots as well as a marine killed in a rescue attempt, he said, \u201cWe will never forget their collusion with terrorists. We have always deemed betrayal the worst and most shameful thing to do, and that will never change. I would like them to remember this \u2013 those in Turkey who shot our pilots in the back, those hypocrites who tried to justify their actions and cover up for terrorists.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even understand why they did it. Any issues they might have had, any problems, any disagreements we knew nothing about could have been settled in a different way. Plus, we were ready to cooperate with Turkey on all the most sensitive issues it had; we were willing to go further, where its allies refused to go. Allah only knows, I suppose, why they did it. And probably, Allah has decided to punish the ruling clique in Turkey by taking their mind and reason.\u201d\n\nRelated: Obama Says Russia Wants Out of Syria. Putin Says, \u2018Nyet\u2019\n\nPutin\u2019s criticism wasn\u2019t reserved for Turkey. Without directly naming the United States, he nevertheless made it clear that he was accusing the U.S. of being responsible for the current state of chaos across the Middle East.\n\n\u201cTerrorism is a growing threat today. The Afghanistan problem has not been resolved. The situation there is alarming and gives us no optimism, while some of the relatively peaceful and stable countries in the Middle East and North Africa \u2013 Iraq, Libya and Syria \u2013 have now plunged into chaos and anarchy that pose a threat to the whole world.\n\n\u201cWe all know why that happened. We know who decided to oust the unwanted regimes and brutally impose their own rules. Where has this led them? They stirred up trouble, destroyed the countries\u2019 statehood, set people against each other, and then \u2018washed their hands,\u2019, as we say in Russia, thus opening the way to radical activists, extremists and terrorists.\u201d\n\nA less friendly audience might have noted the irony of a leader whose own troops recently invaded Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula and are currently supporting violent rebellion in the eastern part of Ukraine protesting U.S. intervention in other countries. But that didn\u2019t happen in the Kremlin on Thursday.\n\nRelated: Putin \u2013 Turkey Buys Oil from ISIS and Erdogan Knows All About It\n\nFinally, Putin renewed his plea that Russians with large mounts of capital held overseas return it, extending an amnesty program for six months and suggesting that the its terms \u2013 which allow capital to be brought back to Russia with no questions asked \u2013 would be loosened even further.\n\n\u201cLast year we announced the so-called capital amnesty to return financial assets to Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cYet, businesses seem in no hurry to take advantage of that opportunity, which suggests that the procedure proposed is too complicated, while guarantees it provides are still insufficient.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, here are the guarantees as Putin described them in the same speech last year:\n\n\u201cIf a person legalizes his holdings and property in Russia, he will receive firm legal guarantees that he will not be summoned to various agencies, including law enforcement agencies, that they will not \u2018put the squeeze\u2019 on him, that he will not be asked about the sources of his capital and methods of its acquisition, that he will not be prosecuted or face administrative liability, and that he will not be questioned by the tax service or law enforcement agencies. We all understand that the sources of assets are different, that they were earned or acquired in various ways. However, I am confident that we should finally close, turn the \u2018offshore page\u2019 in the history of our economy and our country. It is very important and necessary to do this.\u201d\n\nRelated: Can ISIS Save the Russian Economy for Putin?\n\nAt the time, experts in money laundering enforcement agreed that the object of the policy was plainly to encourage criminals and oligarchs who had moved massive amounts of cash overseas to bring that money back home.\n\nApparently, it hasn\u2019t been working.\n\nPutin is riding a bit of a high right now, with his actions against ISIS in Syria beginning to win him at least limited approval in Western Europe. But any leader in the position of begging criminals to bring their money home can\u2019t be standing on the firmest of footing.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "In a wide-ranging speech to Russia\u2019s Federal Assembly on Thursday, roughly the equival", "title": "Putin Rails Against the US \u2013 and Asks Oligarchs to Bring Their Money Home", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/04/Putin-Rails-Against-US-and-Asks-Oligarchs-Bring-Their-Money-Home", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-russia-putin_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/04/Putin-Rails-Against-US-and-Asks-Oligarchs-Bring-Their-Money-Home", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/mideast-crisis-syria-russia-putin_1.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "In a wide-ranging speech to Russia\u2019s Federal Assembly on Thursday, roughly the equival", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But any leader in the position of begging criminals to bring their money home can\u2019t be standing on the firmest of footing.\nIt is very important and necessary to do this.\u201dRelated: Can ISIS Save the Russian Economy for Putin?\nAt the time, experts in money laundering enforcement agreed that the object of the policy was plainly to encourage criminals and oligarchs who had moved massive amounts of cash overseas to bring that money back home.\nPutin is riding a bit of a high right now, with his actions against ISIS in Syria beginning to win him at least limited approval in Western Europe.\nThe Turkish president angrily denied all the accusations, but on Thursday Putin repeated them, with the additional suggestion that Erdogan and other Turkish leaders were being subjected to some sort of divine punishment that has impaired their judgment."}
