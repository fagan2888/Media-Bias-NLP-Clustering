After all, Pelosi says, \u201cThat\u2019s what Pope Franci told us to do.\u201d\n\nHere are Pelosi\u2019s unbelievable remarks, courtesy of CNS News:\n\nPelosi told reporters in her Thursday press briefing that \u201cit doesn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d saying that there could be legislative compromise, which was \u201cwhat Pope Francis told us to do.\u201d Then she cited remarks in the Pope\u2019s September speech to Congress. \u201cRepublicans are moving forward with a GOP reconciliation package that once again lays the groundwork for another Republican government shutdown. It\u2019s a waste of time. It will go nowhere in the Senate,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIt will be their 61st vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and they will of course be wanting to defund Planned Parenthood, destroy the Affordable Care Act, dismantle newfound health security for millions of Americans,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way,\u201d Pelosi emphasized. \u201cInstead we could be working together recognizing a Republican Congress, a Democratic president, the ability for Democrats to use their leverage legislatively to have compromise for the good of the American people. That\u2019s what Pope Francis told us to do. \u201cHe said leaders should have transparency. That would be wonderful \u2013 openness, he said. He used the word openness and pragmatism, and he said we have to move forward for the good of the people. Let\u2019s in the spirit of Francis do that,\u201d she added.\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nActually, Pope Francis brought a consistent pro-life message to the nation\u2019s leaders in September and admonished members of Congress in a speech today to \u201cdefend life at every stage of development.\u201d\n\nAlso in September, the pontiff wrote in a letter that the tragedy of abortion devastates women and their families, which is why he believes the Church needs to continue offering God\u2019s forgiveness.\n\nHe said, \u201cI think in particular of all the women who have resorted to abortion. I am well aware of the pressure that has led them to this decision. I know that it is an existential and moral ordeal. I have met so many women who bear in their heart the scar of this agonizing and painful decision.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWhat has happened is profoundly unjust; yet only understanding the truth of it can enable one not to lose hope. The forgiveness of God cannot be denied to one who has repented, especially when that person approaches the Sacrament of Confession with a sincere heart in order to obtain reconciliation with the Father.\u201d\n\nAlthough some pro-abortion Catholics have argued that Pope Francis\u2019 gesture is a sign that the Church is becoming more \u201cprogressive\u201d on abortion, recent statements he\u2019s made in Cuba and in the United States prove this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. In fact, yesterday Pope Francis said his primary reason for his visit to America was for the cause of life.\n\nPope Francis said, \u201cI appreciate the unfailing commitment of the Church in America to the cause of life and that of the family, which is the primary reason for my present visit.\u201d At the Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle, he encouraged Catholics to remain vigilant in their opposition to abortion and listed unborn children among innocent people who the bishops must keep at the top of the priority list of people who deserve protection.\n\nHe lists, \u201cthe innocent victim of abortion, children who die of hunger or from bombings, immigrants who drown in the search for a better tomorrow, the elderly or the sick who are considered a burden, the victims of terrorism, wars, violence and drug trafficking, the environment devastated by man\u2019s predatory relationship with nature \u2013 at stake in all of this is the gift of God, of which we are noble stewards but not masters.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is wrong, then, to look the other way or to remain silent. Ever present within each of them is life as gift and responsibility. The future freedom and dignity of our societies depends on how we face these challenges,\u201d he concluded.\n\nAdditionally, on September 20th, Pope Francis told a group of Cuban nuns, priests, bishops and seminarians to protect their \u201csmallest\u201d and most vulnerable members, including unborn children. CNN reports that he also said Jesus shines in the lives of hidden and ignored people, referring to those who suffer from degenerative diseases.\n\nLater that evening, he said, \u201cChildren aren\u2019t loved, they\u2019re killed before being born. The elderly are thrown away, because they don\u2019t produce. Some countries have euthanasia. But in some others there a hidden euthanasia. The youth is thrown away because they have no job opportunities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Pelosi: Pro-Lifers Should Compromise on Planned Parenthood, \"That\u2019s What Pope Francis Told Us to Do\"", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "Nancy Pelosi has never been known as a faithful Catholic and her latest gaffe will help cement that reputation even further.
