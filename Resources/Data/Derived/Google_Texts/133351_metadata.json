Oprah was responsible for about a million votes for Obama during those primaries.\u201d\n\nKlein\u2019s book cites polling that showed the previously apolitical Winfrey saw her favorable rating drop from 74 percent to 66 percent after she made the endorsement. However, the result for Obama was a boon, as the book cites a University of Maryland study that estimated the Oprah endorsement meant 1,015,559 votes for Obama. The Pew Research Center found the talk show host made Obama more popular to black and women voters when he was running against frontrunner Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cShe traveled around the country campaigning for him, with the proviso that she believed that she had a promise from the Obamas that in return she would be given special access to the White House,\u201d Klein said. \u201cWhen she tried to get that access, Valerie Jarrett froze her out, closed the door on her. I think she has been ever since very upset with them and I think regrets that she was so helpful in the first place.\u201d\n\nJarrett, a top White House adviser and long-time friend of the Obamas, is described in Klein\u2019s book as the \u201cgatekeeper.\u201d\n\n\u201cValerie Jarrett saw Oprah as a potential threat to her power,\u201d the book says. \u201cIf Oprah went unchecked, she would bypass Valerie and go directly to the president and first lady. What good was it being the gatekeeper if you couldn\u2019t lock the gate when you wanted? And so Valerie set about turning Michelle Against Oprah.\u201d\n\nHowever, this reportedly backfired, according to Klein piece in the Post.\n\n\u201cWhen Valarie Jarrett called Oprah Winfrey, she flatly refused to go to the White House and sent a low level representative, which was a direct slap in the face to the president,\u201d Klein told TheBlaze.\n\nThe Post story quoted an anonymous source, identified as one of Winfrey\u2019s closest advisers, saying: \u201cAll of Oprah\u2019s top people thought she would go, because when the president invites you to the White House, most people automatically say yes. But Oprah said she didn\u2019t have the time or inclination to go.\u201d\n\n\u2013", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama likely regrets alienating talk show queen Oprah Winfrey, whose endorsement helped him win the presidency in 2008, author and journalist Edward Klein told TheBlaze.
