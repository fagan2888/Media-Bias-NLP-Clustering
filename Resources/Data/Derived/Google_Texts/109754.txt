"Cake Boss" reality show star Buddy Valastro and his family had to be rescued from New York Harbor on Friday night after a thick fog rolled in, making it impossible to navigate safely.

We'll wait right here while you make your best "I'll bet the fog was as thick as cake batter" (or other bakery item of your choosing) jokes.

Ready to continue? OK.

The New York Daily News reports

that the FDNY's Summer Boat Program had to be called in to rescue Valastro's 36-foot Boston Whaler around 9:30 p.m after it floated up near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge into the Ambrose Channel, which sees frequent commercial shipping traffic.

Valastro was on board with 12 other people, including nine kids.

The FDNY and NYPD used a infrared system to locate the boat and tow it out of the shipping lanes.

The passengers were no worse for the wear, save for some seasickness.

Valastro posted a thank-you note on Instagram afterward.

In a second photo caption, he noted that, "Next time we go out at night, we need to check the forecast. #mywifewantstokillme."

Valastro owns Carlos Bakery shops in Hoboken and Red Bank.
