But the quiet fight over tax-exempt status in health care has been dragging on for years.\n\nTraditionally, those battles centered on a different player: hospitals. An Illinois board stripped Provena Covenant Medical Center of its property-tax exemption in 2004. The Senate Finance Committee grilled the executives of 10 leading hospital systems in 2005.\n\n\u201cDo Tax-Exempt Hospitals Have a Future?\u201d Lisa Petkun and Michelle Parten asked in a Pepper Hamilton law brief.\n\nThat was 2009.\n\nDespite threat after threat, not-for-profit hospitals persisted to keep their tax exemptions. Their strongest argument, experts say, has been to demonstrate that they collectively provide billions of dollars in community benefit, especially to uninsured or impoverished patients.\n\nBut there\u2019s new momentum to change how hospitals earn tax-exempt status \u2014 especially in California, where two bills are in front of the legislature.\n\nSB 346, introduced by state Sen. Bob Wieckowski (D-Fremont), requires hospitals to allocate 90% of their community benefit funding to charity care and projects to help particularly vulnerable populations.\n\nAB 1046, backed by the California Hospital Association, introduces more subtle changes: it aims to streamline reporting and make the process more transparent by aligning state and federal community benefit laws.\n\nHospitals aren\u2019t enthusiastic about SB 346\u2019s mandatory requirements. The bill \u201cimposes vague, unrealistic and costly mandates on not-for-profit hospitals and clinics,\u201d Anne McLeod, senior vice president for the California Hospital Association, wrote in California Healthline\u2018s Think Tank. \u201cAB 1046 improves the system, SB 346 harms it.\u201d\n\nHow Tax-Exempt Status Is Under Pressure Around the Nation\n\nBeyond California, lawsuits and legislation in Connecticut, New Jersey and elsewhere focus on whether not-for-profit hospitals deserve to keep their tax-exemptions.\n\nAnd most importantly, the Affordable Care Act presents new challenges, both direct and oblique, to hospital tax exemptions.\n\nFirst, the law instituted new requirements on hospitals, intended to improve reporting and transparency. (Under the ACA, hospitals must perform community needs assessments, while the IRS must report on the amount of their community benefit \u2014 about 9.7% of hospitals\u2019 expenses in 2011, according to the latest report.)\n\nBut the ACA also could knock out one pillar of why health care organizations need to be tax-exempt: The health law is lowering the uninsured rate. And if the need for hospitals to provide charity care goes down, the hurdles to earning tax-exempt status will likely go up.\n\nMeanwhile, the Blue Shield decision could kick up scrutiny of other insurers, too. For example, a number of Blues already are facing anti-trust lawsuits centered on their market power, Bruce Japsen writes for Forbes.\n\n\u201cThere is an important relationship between what is happening in California and what is happening in our case,\u201d according to Joe Whatley, an attorney for plaintiffs suing the Blues plans. \u201cWhile they claim to be non-profit, they charge their insured more than they should and they pay their providers less than they should. They build up these huge reserves, more than are needed under any circumstances.\u201d\n\nAnd the questions will likely mount as health organizations get larger \u2014 and the value of their exemptions do, too.\n\n\u201cI have never seen an investigation like that on Blue Shield,\u201d USC professor Glenn Melnick told the Los Angeles Times\u2018 Chad Terhune.\n\n\u201cIs this the beginning of a harder look at nonprofits in healthcare?\u201d Melnick added. \u201cIn a lot of cases, nonprofit status is exploited.\u201d\n\nAround the nation\n\nHere\u2019s a look at other stories making news on the road to reform.\n\nCovered California\u2019s disappointing second year. A new Avalere report suggests that California ranked among the five worst states in terms of enrollment growth on its ACA-created insurance exchange, Chris Rauber reports for the San Francisco Business Times.\n\nSGR deal would end \u2018Washington\u2019s most frenzied lobbying extravaganza.\u2019 The proposed permanent \u201cdoc fix\u201d has implications for back-room politics too, Dylan Scott writes for National Journal. \u201cThere are people who have made careers out of navigating the [doc-fix] patch,\u201d one official told Scott. \u201cThis is going to put lobbyists out of business.\u201d\n\nPrivate exchange enrollment doubles in 2015.
