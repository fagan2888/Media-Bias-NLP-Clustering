Q: How does exercise help with depression?

A: Swedish researchers have discovered a new reason for lacing up those sneakers: Exercise not only feels good, it protects the brain from depression.

In mouse studies at the Karolinska Institutet, neuroscientists showed that changes in skeletal muscles helped rid the body of a stress-induced amino acid that has been associated with mental illness.

“Our initial research hypothesis was that trained muscle would produce a substance with beneficial effects on the brain,” said Jorge Ruas, principal investigator at Karolinska Institutet’s Department of Physiology and Pharmacology. “We actually found the opposite: well-trained muscle produces an enzyme that purges the body of harmful substances.”

Well-trained muscles mean increased levels of a protein known as PGC-1(alpha)1. The Swedish scientists developed a mouse strain with high levels of PGC-1(alpha)1 in their muscles and exposed them (and normal mice) to a stressful environment of noises and flashing lights.

After five weeks, the normal mice showed evidence of depressed behavior, but the modified mice did not.

The reason, the scientists believe, was that the modified mice also had higher-than-normal levels of an enzyme called KAT, which, under stress, converts kynurenine into kynurenic acid, which cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. In effect, KAT in these muscled-up mice detoxed their brain of stress-related neurochemicals.

The Swedish study was published in the online version of the journal Cell.
