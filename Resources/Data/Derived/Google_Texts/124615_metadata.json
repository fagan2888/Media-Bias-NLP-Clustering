Can he really, at age 42, with some 24 miles to go?\n\nYes. Oh, yes. This is Jens Voigt, whose audacious \u2014 some would say insane \u2014 breaks from the peloton so far from the finish, combined with his fearless attitude, still evoke fear among riders and have become an indelible part of his persona.\n\nBut this race \u2014 Stage 4 of the USA Pro Challenge on Thursday \u2014 would not be his. With less than 800 meters (half-mile) to go in the 70.3-mile stage before the finish, the peloton swallowed him, denying Voigt a storybook ending to his day. Cannondale Pro rider Elia Viviani won the stage in a sprint into the heart of downtown Colorado Springs.\n\n\u201cI just needed five years less on my life,\u201d Voigt said after the race. \u201cIf I would be 37, I would have won easy. I\u2019m almost 43, and I was just missing three or four or five percent compared to three years or five years ago. That\u2019s just the way nature goes.\u201d\n\nThe Pro Challenge will be Voigt\u2019s last professional race, and his decision to end it in Colorado is no accident: His contingent of U.S. fans is bigger than even his German ones.\n\n\u201cThat was Jens. He knew what he had to do,\u201d former Garmin-Sharp rider Christian Vande Velde said of his breakaway. \u201cThe breakaway was not going fast enough. He just couldn\u2019t do what he used to be able to do. The mind knows what he needs to do, but the body can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAround the course, spectators waved signs, saying, \u201cShut Up Legs!\u201d \u2014 a tribute to one of Voigt\u2019s many sayings, describing what his brain tells his body when it wants to give up in a race.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to, or really allowed, to root for anybody. But how can you not root for this great personality?\u201d said Shawn Hunter, CEO of the Pro Challenge. \u201cHe\u2019s given our sport so much. My heart broke when he got caught.\u201d\n\nVoigt walks away from a sport that \u2014 at least by outward appearances \u2014 appears healthier following high-profile doping scandals from the 1990s through until recently, the latest involving American Lance Armstrong.\n\n\u201cPeople did bad things, obviously,\u201d Voigt said in an interview with The Denver Post on Tuesday in a Mount Crested Butte hotel room. \u201cIt was a widespread disease. Since I\u2019ve never been touched by it, never been tempted by it \u2026 people can test my samples in 10 years or another 100 years with new measures. There\u2019s just nothing there to find. That\u2019s why it\u2019s easy for me to go through it, because there\u2019s no dead bodies in my closet.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m so competitive \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m not winning much anymore \u2014 at my age was because I always worked hard and because we have a level playing field. We don\u2019t have motorbikes in the peloton anymore.\u201d\n\nVoigt was never a rider competing for overall race leads. His glory came with occasional stage wins \u2014 three in the Tour de France, a few at the Tour of California and one at the Giro d\u2019Italia in 2007, plus winning the Criterium International five times. At the 2012 Pro Challenge, he broke away from the peloton and rode solo from Independence Pass to Beaver Creek to win the stage.\n\nPHOTOS: USA Pro Challenge Stage 4 on Thursday\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always an aggressive rider, always exciting to watch,\u201d overall race leader Tejay van Garderen said. \u201cAlways has a good sense of humor. Hopefully, he\u2019s a personality that\u2019ll stick around in the sport, if not in racing than in some other fashion.\u201d\n\nHis opportunity for a stage win is rapidly closing. He said he expected to try to recover for Friday and race a competitive time trial on Saturday in Vail. Then, there\u2019s the final stage from Boulder to Denver.\n\n\u201cIt ain\u2019t over till the fat lady sings, right?\u201d Voigt said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got three more days to go, but yeah, I wanted it today, definitely.\u201d\n\nTalk to him long enough \u2014 even if it\u2019s after an agonizingly difficult loss such as Thursday\u2019s \u2014 and it\u2019s easy to see why he\u2019s loved. He cracks jokes at his own expense. And before races, he signs autographs for fans and poses for photos.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll miss seeing him at breakfast, or in the hall at the hotel,\u201d said Garmin-Sharp cyclist Tom Danielson. \u201cHe just loves what he does for a living. You see so many guys take the opportunity they have for granted. \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to do another stage today,\u2019 or, \u2018Oh, I had a mechanical (issue) yesterday.\u2019 For him, it doesn\u2019t matter how he\u2019s doing in the race. It doesn\u2019t matter how he feels. He always has a smile on his face and doesn\u2019t take one single day of his life for granted. And that\u2019s something we all need to remember.\u201d\n\nBut the man who just never seems to give up knows it\u2019s time to stop. He won\u2019t miss the suffering, going to sleep early, racing in bad weather, with mud from other riders splattering in his eyes. He wants to drink beer and eat unhealthy food just because he can. He won\u2019t have to say no when he daughter asks to go horseback riding, fearing he\u2019ll break bones.\n\n\u201cI want to be remembered as somebody working hard, walking straight in life, most of the time,\u201d Voigt said, \u201cand just being a down-to-earth person, being loyal and being indestructible.\u201d\n\nDenver Post staff writer John Meyer contributed to this report.\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "For Jens Voigt, valiant effort at Pro Challenge falls agonizingly short as career end nears", "title": "For Jens Voigt, valiant effort at Pro Challenge falls agonizingly short as career end nears", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/21/for-jens-voigt-valiant-effort-at-pro-challenge-falls-agonizingly-short-as-career-end-nears/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140821__voigt-stage-4-082114p1.jpg", "height": 428}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140821__voigt-stage-4-082114p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-21T22:22:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T07:43:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "USA Pro Challenge"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd412e\"", "article_summary": "But how can you not root for this great personality?\u201d said Shawn Hunter, CEO of the Pro Challenge.\nBut this race \u2014 Stage 4 of the USA Pro Challenge on Thursday \u2014 would not be his.\nCannondale Pro rider Elia Viviani won the stage in a sprint into the heart of downtown Colorado Springs.\nPHOTOS: USA Pro Challenge Stage 4 on Thursday\u201cHe\u2019s always an aggressive rider, always exciting to watch,\u201d overall race leader Tejay van Garderen said.\nAt the 2012 Pro Challenge, he broke away from the peloton and rode solo from Independence Pass to Beaver Creek to win the stage."}
