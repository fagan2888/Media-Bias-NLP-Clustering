A hot air balloon was on display along the side of Arlington Expressway Friday morning to promote the Affordable Care Act.

Jacksonville Councilwoman Joyce Morgan is promoting the stunt to get people signed up for health insurance before they're forced to pay a nearly $700 penalty.

The ownership at the Lampkins Patterson Funeral Home is encouraging people to sign up for health insurance on Saturday. Morgan’s hot air balloon will be on the side of the Arlington Expressway to also promote signup.

"With all these political debate, everybody's been saying Obamacare's full of hot air. But what we're letting people know is that you need to get covered. This is the absolutely last time for you to do it," said First Coast Care Team member Mincy Pollock.

Pollock said the venue was chosen, "because it's a life and death situation."

Sunday is the deadline to sign up for health insurance using the Affordable Care Act. Enrollments or changes between Jan. 16 and Jan. 31 will take effect Mar. 1.
