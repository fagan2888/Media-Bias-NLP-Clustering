University will provide some new leadership and business advice but the hospital retains its name and its 300 employees, according to a news release. The hospital in Sandersville is the county\u2019s largest employer, according to the release.\n\nThe hospital will get a new CEO, a new chief nursing officer and possibly a new chief operating officer or other administrator that Washington Regional will pay but will actually be part of University\u2019s team, said University CEO Jim Davis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to keep people up to date today with all of the changes that are going on if you\u2019re not part of a big system,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll help them with strategic planning, business office functions, things like that.\u201d\n\nFor instance, the Sanders\u00adville hospital is due for an inspection by The Joint Commission; University will help them prepare for that, Davis said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for people at that size of an organization to keep up with all of those rules,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll be sending a whole team of people down there to make sure they are ready and doing everything appropriately.\u201d\n\nEqually important, Washington Regional will have access to University\u2019s purchasing agreements.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve done well but to take the next step they really need to leverage the assets of a big system, things like with the supply chain, better buying power,\u201d Davis said. For instance, checking to see whether a self-pay patient could actually qualify for coverage through the Medicaid program or others, which University routinely does, he said.\n\nWashington Regional will pay a $10,000 a month fee as part of the arrangement but \u201cthey will recoup that very quickly,\u201d he said.\n\nUniversity was chosen from among five organizations responding to a request for proposals earlier this year, and as far as Davis knows this is its first management contract. But it is part of a broader strategy the health care system is pursuing of reaching out regionally.\n\nUniversity had sought to build a hospital in Columbia County, and its board may decide later this month to appeal that denial, and last week University announced it would seek a 50-bed hospital in Aiken. Two years ago, McDuffie Regional Medical Center became University Hospital McDuffie and University is building a 25-bed replacement hospital there. It is part of a strategy for survival in the face of shrinking reimbursements, Davis said.\n\n\u201cThis is part of that strategy to reach out, to have access points to our system in as many locations as we can get so people can get care closer to home and get quality care and hopefully build our market share as we try to overcome some of the revenue losses that are sure to come with the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile University already gets a lot of referrals from the area, it is really more about helping Washington Regional, Davis said.\n\n\u201cUnless they can leverage our scale, reduce their costs and increase their expertise, they\u2019re going to have a tough time making a go of it going forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is more about them than us.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Augusta, georgia, newspaper, classifieds, augusta chronicle news, news, sports, entertainment, local information, masters, golf, masters tournament, local businesses, shopping, daily deals, north augusta, SRS, south carolina, CSRA, aiken", "og": {"site_name": "The Augusta Chronicle", "description": "University Hospital will help manage the Washington County Regional Medical Center even as it continues to increase its geographic spread across the area.", "title": "University Hospital to manage Washington County hospital", "url": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/business/2014-12-08/university-hospital-manage-washington-county-hospital", "image": "http://chronicle.augusta.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "Augusta Georgia\u2019s source for News, Entertainment, Sports, Weather, Classifieds, Jobs, Autos, Real Estate and Masters information from The Augusta Chronicle, chronicle.augusta.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee01\"", "article_summary": "Two years ago, McDuffie Regional Medical Center became University Hospital McDuffie and University is building a 25-bed replacement hospital there.\nWhile University already gets a lot of referrals from the area, it is really more about helping Washington Regional, Davis said.\nThe Hospital Authority of Washington County signed a five-year management deal with University to start Jan. 1.\nWashington Regional will pay a $10,000 a month fee as part of the arrangement but \u201cthey will recoup that very quickly,\u201d he said.\nUniversity had sought to build a hospital in Columbia County, and its board may decide later this month to appeal that denial, and last week University announced it would seek a 50-bed hospital in Aiken."}
