Another home victory, the last of the season, had come and gone. And the fans of No. 14 Maryland realized just how spoiled they have been.\n\nThe Terrapins played 19 home games this season and won 18 of them, capped by Saturday\u2019s 66-56 victory over Michigan. With the win, Maryland finished 9-0 in Big Ten home games, completing an unbeaten home conference slate for the first time since the 2001-02 season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure, but I\u2019m 99.9 percent sure this is my first team in 17 years that\u2019s gone undefeated in league play at home,\u201d Turgeon said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve had a lot of really good teams.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: Dez Wells leads No. 14 Maryland past Michigan on Senior Day\n\nIn his postgame press conference, Turgeon singled out three \u201cMVPs\u201d responsible for such an accomplishment. The first was Senior Director of Marketing Lauren Taylor, who helped organize the flash mob during Tuesday\u2019s game against Wisconsin and other in-game events throughout the season. Then Turgeon recognized the players and, finally, the fans.\n\nSaturday\u2019s game had an announced crowd of 17,950, marking the second consecutive sellout at Xfinity Center.\n\n\u201cI can think of three or four games this year that probably we shouldn\u2019t come out on top, and our fans just wouldn\u2019t let us lose,\u201d Turgeon said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why you come to Maryland, to be a part of an environment like that.\u201d\n\nSince losing to No. 2 Virginia on Dec. 3, the Terrapins have rattled off 13 consecutive victories at home, including several nail-biters. Senior Dez Wells made a miraculous last-second putback to lead Maryland to a 68-67 win over Northwestern. Two weeks later, Yogi Ferrell\u2019s last-second shot fell short and the Terrapins escaped with a 68-66 win over Indiana.\n\nWells said the streak of home success is no small feat.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot to me,\u201d Wells said. \u201cIt means more to the program and to the next wave of talent that comes in here. It means a lot to those guys as well. It means a lot right now, but I\u2019m pretty sure 10 years from now and after the season, it\u2019ll mean more to me at that particular moment. We still have a lot more basketball to play.\u201d\n\nThe Terrapins will close out the regular season with road games at Rutgers on Thursday and Nebraska on March 8. They will then travel to the United Center in Chicago for the conference tournament, and their assigned NCAA Tournament site after that.\n\nThe 2014-15 home schedule is over, but the season winds on.\n\n\u201cWe still have a lot to play for,\u201d senior Evan Smotrycz said. \u201cHopefully we\u2019re remembered for more than just being undefeated at home in Big Ten play.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With a 66-56 win over Michigan, the Terrapins completed an unbeaten home conference slate for the first time since the 2001-02 season.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "With a 66-56 win over Michigan, the Terrapins completed an unbeaten home conference slate for the first time since the 2001-02 season.", "title": "No. 14 Maryland caps undefeated home slate in first Big Ten season", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/28/no-14-maryland-caps-undefeated-home-slate-first-bi/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/28/Michigan_Maryland_Basketball.JPEG-03af8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/02/28/Michigan_Maryland_Basketball.JPEG-03af8.jpg", "description": "With a 66-56 win over Michigan, the Terrapins completed an unbeaten home conference slate for the first time since the 2001-02 season.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "No. 14 Maryland caps undefeated home slate in first Big Ten season"}, "Author": "Tom Schad", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce6d5\"", "article_summary": "With the win, Maryland finished 9-0 in Big Ten home games, completing an unbeaten home conference slate for the first time since the 2001-02 season.\nThe Terrapins played 19 home games this season and won 18 of them, capped by Saturday\u2019s 66-56 victory over Michigan.\n14 Maryland past Michigan on Senior DayIn his postgame press conference, Turgeon singled out three \u201cMVPs\u201d responsible for such an accomplishment.\nSenior Dez Wells made a miraculous last-second putback to lead Maryland to a 68-67 win over Northwestern.\n\u201cHopefully we\u2019re remembered for more than just being undefeated at home in Big Ten play.\u201d"}
