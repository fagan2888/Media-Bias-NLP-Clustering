The overall budget proposed by Gov. Butch Otter for next year reflects a 6.2 percent increase from this year, but if maintenance items and the proposed new Primary Care Access Program are taken out, it\u2019s only a 2 percent increase.\n\n\u201cMedicaid continues to be about 80 percent of our overall budget,\u201d Armstrong told the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee. \u201cLast year it was 80.8 percent.\u201d About 85 percent of the total appropriation for Health & Welfare \u201cis paid to private service providers, primarily here in Idaho,\u201d he said.\n\nArmstrong outlined the PCAP proposal. \u201cThis is for Idaho adults who are in the \u2018gap,\u2019 who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid or a tax credit to purchase insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cThey earn less than 100 percent of poverty, which is $980 a month for a single adult. Unlike us, they don\u2019t have access to regular health care and suffer because of it. The impact can be tragic \u2013 poor physical and mental health, reduced capacity to work, homelessness and even premature death.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cPCAP can help address this disparity in our health care system. It is an all-Idaho initiative, with Idaho controlling the eligibility criteria.\u201d He noted, \u201cPCAP is not insurance, and does not provide comprehensive services, such as hospitalization or specialty care. Because of this, the county and state indigent programs are still necessary.\u201d\n\nHe said the program would provide a \u201cpatient-centered medical home\u201d to each of its enrollees, estimated at 75,000 of the 78,000 Idahoans who now fall into the coverage gap. That would mean \u201ca team of practitioners in a primary care practice who take a proactive role in your health care and coordinate all your health care needs. \u2026 If you are due for a screening, they will contact and remind you. If you just got out of the hospital, they will provide your follow-up care.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me be clear: PCAP is not an entitlement program,\u201d Armstrong told lawmakers. \u201cEnrollment is subject to available funding. Also, participants are required to share costs and be actively engaged in their treatment plans. If not, they lose eligibility.\u201d\n\nWhen a patient enrolls, their primary care provider would conduct a health assessment, including their preventive, physical and mental health needs, and a treatment plan to address them. Basic medications, labs, X-rays and limited behavioral health services would be covered.\n\n\u201cOne of the standards that patient-centered medical homes embrace is to offer extended hours and weekend appointments to expand their acute care capacity,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cThis can greatly reduce unnecessary emergency department use and hospitalizations.\u201d\n\nChronic conditions account for more than 75 percent of health care spending today, Armstrong said. Coordinating care for those, including asthma, diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, depression and more, and managing them on the front end will prevent the need for more costly critical care and lead to better patient outcomes, he said.\n\nHowever, if patients need critical care, they\u2019d still be referred for it \u2013 even though it\u2019s not covered under PCAP. \u201cThe costs of that treatment may end up being paid through the county-state indigent programs or as charity care from community organizations,\u201d Armstrong told lawmakers.\n\nHe said if lawmakers approve PCAP, it\u2019ll be implemented on Jan. 1, 2017.\n\n\u201cIn my discussions with the governor, he\u2019s been quite adamant that we do something this session for people caught in the health care gap,\u201d Armstrong said. \u201cI know and understand the difficulty in considering full Medicaid expansion. This is why we think PCAP is an achievable solution. Even better, it provides a foundation that we can build on for the future.\u201d\n\nSaid Armstrong, \u201cFrom my 40 years of experience with health care, I think PCAP can reduce health care costs for all of us. It also can provide our state with a more productive workforce, and improve the overall health of our communities.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Idaho Health & Welfare Director Dick Armstrong is kicking off a week of health and human services budget hearings this morning, with an overview of the department\u2019s budget issues.
