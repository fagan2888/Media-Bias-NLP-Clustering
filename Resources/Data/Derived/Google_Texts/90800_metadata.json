Here are just a couple weird rain events that have happened so far this month.\n\nFirst, Tucson has seen rain and thunderstorms around the city, but nothing measurable at the airport yet. TIA has had a trace of rain so far for the month. Our rain for the year is sitting at 3.70 inches, about half an inch above average.\n\nThe high country in Arizona has seen their fair share of rain so far this month. Thunderstorms formed a few days ago in the state thanks to Andres' moisture moving in. Flagstaff saw an inch of rain last Friday which is well more than the average for the month and actually more rain in that one day than the last five Junes combined.\n\n\n\n\n\nCourtesy of NWS Flagstaff.\n\nPhoenix saw .16\" of rain on Friday. What make this weird is that Phoenix before 2015 had two calendar days without measurable rainfall ever. June 5th and June 11th. Now Phoenix has one calendar date ever without measurable rainfall and that is the lone date of June 11th. For the month Phoenix has .19 inches of rainfall, well more than the .02\" normally seen in the month for Phoenix.\n\nAnother side note about Phoenix this month: Phoenix has not seen rain the first two weeks of June since 1993, 22 years later they are sitting with .19\" and more likely as Blanca's moisture will bring more thunderstorms to all areas of the state in just a few days.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "After an unusual wet and cool May, we are now dealing with some rare events with the weather this June.
