Paul Ryan's new budget, leaks to friendly sources suggested it would contain something new. \"The upcoming House Republican budget will focus on welfare reform and recommend a sweeping overhaul of social programs,\" reported Robert Costa last month, after Ryan had given some short speeches about poverty and released a study of possible overhauls to programs. \"Putting a comprehensive anti-poverty agenda alongside efforts to devise an alternative to the federal health-care law is a GOP priority.\"\n\nBut the budget contains none of this\u2014no new health care reforms, no poverty program reforms. Jonathan Chait saw it coming.\n\nRyan and his colleagues have devoted a lot of rhetorical attention to the 47 percent, or the \"takers,\" and the corresponding need to stop letting them take stuff. Ryan wants it to be known that he does not personally have anything against the takers. And, who knows \u2014 maybe he doesn't. But even if you were to exterminate every wisp of anti-taker hostility within the party, what would remain behind is not love but disinterest. He and his party will always care about low taxes and high defense spending more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThroughout the whole \"quiet pitch\" period, Ryan had been talking with and touring cities with community organizer Robert Woodson. I called up Woodson to see whether he was disappointed by the lack of solutions in the Ryan budget.\n\n\"Both the budgets of the Republicans and the Democrats are political documents,\" said Woodson. \"They\u2019re intended for the next election. Repeal of Obamacare is not going to pass, and raising the federal minimum wage is not going to pass. We have to wait till the election is over to do something serious.\"\n\nBut as we kept talking, Woodson pushed up the schedule.\n\n\"This summer, we\u2019re planning to bring our group together\u201450 allies from around the country,\" he said. \"I think this is an appropriate year to do it. It has be done this year, because of the anniversary of the War on Poverty. And I do think there will be some specific, concrete anti-poverty proposals put on the table. That\u2019s the reason that I consented to take [Ryan] around. But rather than government policy driving programs to aid the poor, we must look at policies that are working from the bottom up.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "Paul Ryan\u2019s Anti-Poverty Guru Still Expects Some Legislation \u201cThis Year\u201d", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "In the months leading up to the release of Rep.
