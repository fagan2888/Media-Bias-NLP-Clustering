Tim Kaine, D-Va., during an event at the CATO Institute.\n\nObama claims he has legal ability to continue the war against ISIS under previous authorizations for the use of military force\u2014one passed in 2001 to fight al-Qaeda following September 11, and the other in 2002 to invade Iraq.\n\nThe president began airstrikes against ISIS Aug. 8 but did not send a draft of authorization to Congress until six months later, including a message stating that \u201cexisting statutes provide me with the authority I need\u201d to continue the war regardless of approval.\n\nKaine called the justification \u201cridiculous\u201d and said both Congress and the president have \u201ccompletely shredded\u201d the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which bars the president from continuing war beyond 90 days unless Congress approves it.\n\n\u201cOne year of war against the Islamic State has transformed a president, who was elected in part because of his early opposition to the Iraq War, into an executive war president\u2014maybe a perpetual war president,\u201d said Kaine, who called the war \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\nCongress is also to blame, Kaine continued, noting that lawmakers have done \u201cvirtually nothing\u201d to assert their congressional authority to declare war despite bipartisan support in both houses for military action against ISIS. He claimed that at least three-quarters of lawmakers support action.\n\n\u201cOne year in, our servicemen our doing their jobs and they\u2019re waiting on us to do ours,\u201d he said.\n\nThe day after Obama announced his campaign to \u201cdegrade and ultimately destroy\u201d ISIS, Kaine authored a resolution that would force Congress to vote on war authorization, but the measure failed immediately.\n\nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing to discuss an authorization a month after president Obama sent his drafted resolution, but Congress has remained relatively inactive since.\n\nDemocrats argue that the president\u2019s draft is not restrictive enough on geographic and temporal limitations, while Republicans find it too restrictive.\n\nKaine warns that by sidestepping its right to give approval, Congress is presenting \u201cindifference\u201d to ISIS, U.S. allies and the troops fighting the war.\n\n\u201cA debate in Congress by the people\u2019s elected representatives and a vote to authorize the most solemn act of war is how we tell our troops that what they\u2019re doing\u2014what they\u2019re risking their lives for\u2014has purpose, has meaning and has the support of the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise we\u2019re asking them to risk their lives without even bothering to discuss whether the mission is something we support.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. began its latest war in the Middle East one year ago, launching a military campaign against ISIS that military experts say could last a decade.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The U.S. began its latest war in the Middle East one year ago, launching a military campaign against ISIS that military experts say could last a decade.", "title": "Democrat: War Vs.
