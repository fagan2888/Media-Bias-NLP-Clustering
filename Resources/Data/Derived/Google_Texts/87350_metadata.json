That's because a cold-hearted thief broke into her home and stole most of her children's Christmas presents. Police say they've seen a rash of these burglaries over the past week.\n\nNine-year-old Cotton Cosby is sad.\n\n\u201cI spend most of my time in my room making them and the biggest one was a bow and arrow for him, my brother Journey,\u201d said Cotton.\n\nBut that bow and arrow and almost everything else under the tree were stolen Monday at this home here near Blanchard.\n\n\u201cYou know the last two nights that I\u2019ve gone to bed, I\u2019ve just felt kind of nervous and anxious. Somebody\u2019s been in my bedroom. Somebody\u2019s been in my kids\u2019 rooms and in my house, and it just makes you feel a little bit vulnerable,\u201d said Cheryl Cosby.\n\nPolice believe they may have a suspect. Security video from another near-by home shows a man trying to get in the house. He walked off briefly, came back and spotted the camera.\n\nPolice say he wore the same kind of military boots that left marks on the Cosby's door. Police are searching for him.\n\n\u201cSo, if nothing else we\u2019d like to at least try to get the presents back for the kids. No one deserves that this time of year,\u201d said Detective Dan Guthrie, McClain County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nAs for Cotton, he doesn't really have any words for the guy who ripped off his family so close to Christmas.\n\n\u201cWell, I would\u2026 I don\u2019t have any words (laughs).\u201d\n\nPolice are investigating five similar burglaries over the past week, two of them just Wednesday. If you recognize the person in the video, or if you'd like to make a donation to the Cosby family, call the McClain County Sheriff's Office.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "A single mother of nine is heartbroken.", "author": "Aaron Brilbeck", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/30720664/blanchard-familys-christmas-presents-stolen-by-burglar", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9436117_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A single mother of nine is heartbroken.", "title": "Blanchard Family\u2019s Christmas Presents Stolen by Burglar"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/9436117_G.jpg", "description": "A single mother of nine is heartbroken.", "card": "summary", "title": "Blanchard Family\u2019s Christmas Presents Stolen by Burglar"}, "wnreadableurl": "blanchard-familys-christmas-presents-stolen-by-burglar", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "date": "2015/12/10", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "owner": "KWTV", "KEYWORDS": "Christmas, presents, stolen, burglar, Blanchard, okc, news 9, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS03", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "Christmas, presents, stolen, burglar, Blanchard, okc, news 9, kwtv"}, "article_summary": "That's because a cold-hearted thief broke into her home and stole most of her children's Christmas presents.\nThat's because a cold hearted thief broke into her home and stole most of her children's Christmas presents.\nBut that bow and arrow and almost everything else under the tree were stolen Monday at this home here near Blanchard.\nAs for Cotton, he doesn't really have any words for the guy who ripped off his family so close to Christmas.\n\u201cSo, if nothing else we\u2019d like to at least try to get the presents back for the kids."}
