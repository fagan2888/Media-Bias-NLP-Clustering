About the Author Elizabeth Slattery Legal Fellow and Appellate Advocacy Program Manager\n\nEdwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies\n\nOn October 5, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States will begin its next term. The 2014 term featured a number of hot-button issues: free speech cases involving a \u201ctrue threats\u201d prosecution, the Confederate flag, and a local sign ordinance; property rights in the California raisin farmers\u2019 case; religious freedom in a challenge to a prison\u2019s ban on inmates growing beards and a case involving Abercrombie & Fitch\u2019s refusal to hire a Muslim teenager for wearing a headscarf; and the long-anticipated showdowns over same-sex marriage and the Obamacare insurance exchanges. Now that the 2014 term is in the rear-view mirror, the focus turns to the upcoming term.\n\nEach term features plenty of cases involving legal housekeeping issues, such as when lawsuits must be filed to be timely and how cases must be litigated or settled. Generally, the Supreme Court does not consider major legal issues until such matters have been considered by the lower courts. After the Court does address a major legal issue, its decision may lead to a host of related questions on which the lower courts, the academy, the media, and Congress have the opportunity to reflect and opine.\n\nFor example, in Obergefell v. Hodges, the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses protect a right to same-sex marriage but did not address the question of how to handle religious objections to being involved in those ceremonies\u2014an issue that is currently being debated in Congress and the states. Given several pending actions against bakers, photographers, and others in the wedding industry that refuse to participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies, the issue may be heading to the Supreme Court in the coming years. Similarly, in Reed v. Town of Gilbert, the Court struck down a local sign ordinance as content-based regulation of speech in violation of the First Amendment, opening up sign codes across the country to possible attack.\n\nCases on the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015\u20132016 Docket\n\nThe Court typically reviews between 70 and 80 cases per term. It has already agreed to hear 34 cases and likely will add more to the schedule at its September 28 \u201cmegaconference.\u201d Ten cases have been set for oral argument in October, and another 10 will be argued in November. The upcoming term includes a \u201cone person, one vote\u201d challenge to the Texas legislature\u2019s redistricting plan, a handful of capital sentencing cases, an attack on union agency shop fees, and the return of the University of Texas racial preferences case. The following cases are just some of the next term\u2019s likely highlights.\n\nFisher v. University of Texas at Austin. Abigail Fisher\u2019s equal protection challenge to the use of race in undergraduate admissions decisions at the University of Texas first reached the Court in 2013. In Fisher I, the Supreme Court held that schools must prove their use of race in admissions decisions is narrowly tailored to further compelling governmental interests and that courts must look at actual evidence and not rely on schools\u2019 assurances of their good intentions. The justices sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for a more searching examination.\n\nOn remand, the Fifth Circuit again deferred to the university rather than requiring it to articulate its compelling interest and forcing it to provide evidence that racial preferences were necessary. The court found that the university\u2019s newly asserted interest in \u201cqualitative\u201d diversity (enrolling more minority students from majority-white high schools) justified its use of racial preferences.\n\nNow Fisher is back before the Supreme Court, which will consider whether the university\u2019s new diversity rationale can survive strict scrutiny review. Given the history of this case and the fact that a majority of the justices have questioned the continued legitimacy of racial preferences in college admissions, the university may be facing an uphill battle.\n\nLuis v. United States. In Kaley v. United States (2014), the Court held that a criminal defendant\u2019s tainted assets (those that are traceable to a criminal offense) may be restrained before trial even if they are necessary for the defendant to retain a lawyer of his or her choice. The issue in Luis is whether untainted assets also may be restrained prior to trial consistent with the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause and the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of a criminal defendant\u2019s right \u201cto have Assistance of Counsel.\u201d\n\nSila Luis was indicted for Medicare fraud, and the government sought to freeze $45 million of assets that purportedly represent her revenue from the alleged fraud. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1345(2), a federal court may issue a restraining order prohibiting the sale or transfer of \u201cproperty which is traceable to [a Federal health care offense]\u201d or \u201cproperty of equivalent value\u201d (also known as substitute assets). Luis argues that the seizure of a presumptively innocent defendant\u2019s untainted assets \u201cshould be of great concern to this Court\u201d and that the government \u201cpossesses no property right in [the assets] prior to trial.\u201d\n\nThree justices in Kaley suggested that the Constitution requires tracing restrained assets to the charged crime, which would be problematic for untainted, substitute assets. Though the government has an interest in these funds for the purpose of compensating victims (if Luis is ultimately convicted of Medicare fraud), Luis maintains that the government \u201cmust yield to the constitutional rights of the accused.\u201d\n\nFriedrichs v. California Teachers Association. In Abood v. Detroit Board of Education (1977), the Supreme Court held that public employees may be required to pay fees to the local union even if they have opted not to join the union. In such an \u201cagency shop\u201d arrangement, every public employee is represented by the union for purposes of collective bargaining agreements, but those who choose not to join the union pay only an agency fee for a \u201cfair share\u201d of the union\u2019s costs. Unions may not spend such nonmembers\u2019 agency fees on \u201cideological activities unrelated to collective bargaining.\u201d Two cases in recent years, Knox v. SEIU (2012) and Harris v. Quinn (2014), have called into question the validity of Abood for imposing a \u201csignificant impingement\u201d on an employee\u2019s First Amendment free speech and association rights.\n\nIn Friedrichs, a group of California teachers are calling on the Court to overrule Abood, arguing that public-sector collective bargaining is political speech that cannot be distinguished from lobbying and that compelling them to subsidize that speech violates the First Amendment. The Supreme Court noted in Harris that is it \u201cimpossible to argue that\u2026state spending for employee benefits in general[ ] is not a matter of great public concern.\u201d The teachers also challenge California\u2019s law requiring nonmembers to affirmatively \u201copt out\u201d of the union\u2019s political expenses each year. They maintain that the only rationale for putting the burden on individual teachers to opt out is \u201cto give the unions the \u2018advantage of\u2026inertia.\u2019\u201d\n\nMontgomery v. Louisiana. Over the past 10 years, the Supreme Court has chipped away at the states\u2019 framework for dealing with underage individuals who commit the most heinous crimes. In Roper v. Simmons (2005), the Court found that capital punishment for juvenile murderers violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on \u201ccruel and unusual punishment.\u201d In Graham v. Florida (2010), the Court banned the imposition of life-without-parole sentences for juveniles who commit violent crimes other than murder. In Miller v. Alabama (2012), the Court ruled that states may not use sentencing schemes for juvenile murderers that result in automatic life sentences without the possibility of parole. Before such a sentence may be imposed, the sentencing authority must consider the juvenile murderer\u2019s youth and other attendant characteristics.\n\nIndividuals serving life-without-parole sentences have sought to benefit from the Miller ruling. Consequently, in Montgomery, the Supreme Court will consider whether its Miller decision applies retroactively in post-conviction appeals. To do so, the Court must find that Miller either announced a \u201cwatershed\u201d rule of criminal procedure (which the Court has never before found) or categorically barred a penalty for a class of offenders or type of crime.\n\nEvenwel v. Abbott. In Reynolds v. Simms (1964), the Supreme Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause includes a \u201cone-person, one-vote\u201d guarantee. This means that voting districts must be drawn \u201con a basis that will insure, as far as is practicable, that equal numbers of voters can vote for proportionally equal numbers of officials.\u201d In drawing district lines, states are free to choose which population to use, such as total population, voting-age population, citizen voting-age population, citizen-eligible voting-age population, or any other version, as long as the Constitution does not forbid it.\n\nThe plaintiffs in Evenwel challenge the Texas legislature\u2019s use of total population in drawing the state Senate\u2019s districts, arguing that this significantly dilutes their votes compared to neighboring districts with large non-voting populations. A three-judge district court dismissed the plaintiffs\u2019 claim as judicially unreviewable, but the plaintiffs argue that the Supreme Court made clear in Reynolds that \u201ca denial of constitutionally protected rights demands judicial protection\u201d despite the \u201cdangers of [judges] entering the political thickets and mathematical quagmires\u201d of redistricting.\n\nDeath Penalty Sentencing Cases. Last term, in Glossip v. Gross, the Supreme Court found that Oklahoma death-row inmates had failed either to show that the state\u2019s use of certain lethal injection drugs created a \u201cdemonstrated risk of severe pain\u201d or to identify an alternative with a lesser risk of pain. Two dissenting justices suggested that the Court should consider whether capital punishment is constitutional at all. Though the Court is unlikely to reach this constitutional question, it will hear four challenges addressing death penalty sentencing issues.\n\nThe Court will review Florida\u2019s bifurcated sentencing scheme, which requires a judge to find one or more aggravating circumstances in order to impose the death penalty. In Hurst v. Florida, a death-row inmate argues that findings of fact\u2014such as the existence of aggravating or mitigating circumstances\u2014\u201cmay not be entrusted to the judge\u201d in light of Ring v. Arizona (2002). Florida maintains that Ring requires only that the jury decide whether there are sufficient facts to make the defendant eligible for the capital punishment.\n\nThe Supreme Court also will hear three related cases out of Kansas. In Kansas v. Gleason, the Kansas Supreme Court vacated a death penalty sentence because the sentencing jury was not instructed that the defendant did not have to prove mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. The state argues that the Constitution requires that the jury be \u201cpermitted to consider and give effect to all relevant mitigating evidence\u201d and does not mandate a burden of proof. In the consolidated cases of the Carr brothers, who were tried, convicted, and sentenced together, the Kansas Supreme Court reversed their sentences, finding that the trial judge\u2019s decision not to sever their cases at the penalty phase violated their right to an individualized sentencing determination. The state argues that the Eighth Amendment does not categorically prohibit joinder in capital cases and that requiring separate sentencing hearings would have negative consequences, such as allowing one defendant to have a sneak peek at the state\u2019s penalty phase evidence.\n\nCases on the Horizon\n\nAttempting to predict what the Supreme Court will or will not do is a gamble. The Court receives nearly 10,000 petitions for a writ of certiorari each term, and the justices grant review in roughly 1 percent of cases. The following cases, however, have a good chance of being reviewed by the Court in the near future.\n\nSolitary Confinement. When Justice Anthony Kennedy invites a challenge, the Supreme Court bar takes note. Last term, in Davis v. Ayala (a habeas case involving peremptory strikes of jurors), Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion highlighting the harms of long-term solitary confinement and suggesting that the Court consider whether \u201cworkable alternative systems\u201d exist. Just three weeks later, a petition was filed with the Court in Prieto v. Clarke, a due process challenge to a state\u2019s permanent assignment of death-row inmates to solitary confinement. Similar cases are working their way through the federal courts, and inmates who have spent more than a decade in solitary confinement at California\u2019s Pelican Bay State Prison have filed a federal class action, Ashker v. Brown, alleging that this amounts to \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\nAbortion Doctor Admitting Privileges. In recent years, a number of state legislatures have passed laws requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals\u2014a common requirement for many outpatient procedures. After Mississippi\u2019s passage of such a law in 2012, the state\u2019s only licensed abortion clinic challenged the law in court, arguing that this imposed an undue burden on women seeking to obtain abortions. The new law required that all clinic doctors have admitting privileges, and local hospitals rejected the applications from two of the Mississippi clinic\u2019s three doctors, in part because they were from out of state. At the same time, Texas passed a similar law, which also resulted in a lawsuit.\n\nIn Whole Women\u2019s Health v. Cole, a three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit upheld the Texas law, finding that it advanced the Lone Star State\u2019s interest in maternal health and increased the quality of care. Meanwhile, in Currier v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, a different three-judge panel of the same appeals court ruled against Mississippi\u2019s law since it would require women seeking an abortion to go to another state, noting that a state may not \u201clean on its sovereign neighbors to provide protection of its citizens\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d\n\nWarrantless Seizure of Cell Phone Records. As technology advances, the Supreme Court must continually reevaluate the contours of the Fourth Amendment. In recent terms, the Court has reined in law enforcement officers\u2019 use of technology to gather evidence without a warrant. In United States v. Jones (2012), for example, the Court held that police tracking of a suspect\u2019s car with a GPS device constitutes a search under the Fourth Amendment. In Riley v. California (2014), the Court ruled that police must obtain a warrant before searching a cell phone seized incident to an arrest.\n\nThe latest issue in Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is whether the government may seize cell phone location records from service providers without a warrant. The Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703, allows law enforcement officers to acquire an individual\u2019s cell phone location records from telecommunications service providers after obtaining either a warrant or a court order\u2014the latter under a lower standard of proof. These records include incoming and outgoing calls, text messages, and location data.\n\nThe federal appellate courts disagree about whether these records are subject to the third-party doctrine, recognized by the Supreme Court in United States v. Miller (1976) and Maryland v. Smith (1979), that information shared with third parties receives no protection under the Fourth Amendment and that law enforcement authorities can obtain such records from service providers without a warrant. While some appeals courts have concluded that there is no expectation of privacy in cell phone location records, others have found that the third-party doctrine does not apply given the sensitivity of these records and the fact that, at least in a meaningful way, individuals do not give this information to their service providers voluntarily. One petition for a writ of certiorari has already been filed (Davis v. United States), and others may be on the way.\n\nObamacare Contraceptive Mandate. In Burwell v. Hobby Lobby (2014), the Supreme Court held that a rule promulgated pursuant to the Affordable Care Act requiring businesses to offer employee health insurance plans that include contraceptive services violated the rights of some for-profit business owners who objected on religious grounds to paying for or providing abortion-inducing drugs and devices. This holding raised questions about the decision\u2019s impact on pending challenges to an \u201caccommodation\u201d from the mandate that the Obama Administration offered nonprofit religious employers, such as the Little Sisters of the Poor. Under this accommodation, the employer may fill out a form notifying the government of its religious objection to providing such coverage, initiating the process whereby insurers and third-party administrators provide the mandated coverage at no cost to the insured.\n\nTo date, every appeals court to consider the issue has ruled in favor of the government. The Little Sisters of the Poor and others argue that instead of accommodating their religious beliefs, this process also violates their faith by requiring them to hire and maintain contracts with insurance companies that provide objectionable services. With seven petitions (and counting) pending before the Court, the Obama Administration\u2019s accommodation may end up on the docket this term.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s upcoming term begins on October 5, 2015. The justices will hear significant cases involving unions, racial preferences, voting rights, and sentencing in death penalty cases, among others. The Court also may take up cases involving solitary confinement, abortion, seizure of cell phone data by law enforcement, and another challenge to Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate.\n\nAbout the Author Elizabeth Slattery Legal Fellow and Appellate Advocacy Program Manager\n\nEdwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies\n\nis a Legal Fellow in the Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at The Heritage Foundation.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Heritage Foundation", "title": "Overview of the Supreme Court\u2019s October 2015 Term", "url": "http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2015/09/overview-of-the-supreme-courts-october-2015-term", "image": "http://www.heritage.org/~/media/heritage.ashx", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@heritage", "card": "summary", "creator": "@heritage"}, "robots": "NOODP", "keywords": "Supreme Court, justices, cases, unions, racial preferences, voting rights, and sentencing in death penalty cases, solitary confinement, abortion, and another challenge to Obamacare\u2019s contraceptive mandate", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/heritagefoundation"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Overview of the Supreme Court\u2019s October 2015 TermThe Supreme Court\u2019s 2014\u20132015 term included high-profile cases involving same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges, as well as free speech, religious freedom, and property rights.\nKey Points The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s upcoming term begins on October 5, 2015, and the justices have already agreed to hear 34 cases.\nConclusionThe Supreme Court\u2019s upcoming term begins on October 5, 2015.\nCases on the Supreme Court\u2019s 2015\u20132016 DocketThe Court typically reviews between 70 and 80 cases per term.\nGenerally, the Supreme Court does not consider major legal issues until such matters have been considered by the lower courts."}
