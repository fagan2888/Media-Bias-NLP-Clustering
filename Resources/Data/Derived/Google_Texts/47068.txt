550 students, teachers, and staff at Columbus Elementary are packing and moving to a new location.

For more than 100 years, students have walked in and out through the doors at Columbus Elementary, but this year is different, it will be their last time.

Leslie Flores-Espinoza can trace every step of her education at Columbus Elementary. She started at the school in kindergarten and is proud to be a 6th grader now.

She says she wouldn't trade her experience for anything not even a new school.

"I just don't want them knocking it down because this building is special to me," said Flores-Espinoza.

But 550 students, teachers, and staff at Columbus Elementary are preparing for that exact thing to happen, the school is moving to a new location.

"We are literally packing up everything in the building: 45 classrooms, library, cafeteria, music room, art room, computer," said Janet King, principal. "We have to pack everything up. It's been a daunting task, but we are persevering."

Principal Janet King says the move will be bittersweet. The school has been in operation since 1910, but instead of spending the money to renovate the old building. The Oklahoma Public School District is moving the elementary to a middle school, recently renovated as part of the MAPS project.

The district is considering a plan to demolish Columbus Elementary and build a new school in its place.
