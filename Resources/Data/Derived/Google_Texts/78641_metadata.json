Susana Martinez and state lawmakers are hoping to get approval for proposals to bridge the doctor gap. In recent months, Martinez unveiled a $5 million package of initiatives to go before this year's legislative session. They include beefing up loan repayment programs and adding new positions for primary care physicians and nurse practitioners at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center.\n\n\n\n\"Expanding Medicaid was the right thing to do for New Mexico,\" Martinez said last week. \"But we have an important obligation to meet the new demands imposed by it.\"\n\n\n\nThe Legislative Finance Committee has proposed diverting $11.6 million to increasing medical residencies and loan repayment programs, and medical education funding.\n\n\n\nThe shortage is also enhanced by an anticipated wave of retiring physicians. New MexicoHealth Resources, Inc., a nonprofit that seeks to recruit health care providers, reports the state has the highest percentage nationwide of physicians 60 years and older.\n\n\n\n\"This is what is really going to hit New Mexico,\" said Jerry Harrison, the nonprofit's director whose family doctor and dentist retired last year.\n\n\n\nOfficials are also concerned that rural areas of the state will feel the shortage more severely. A report by the UNM Health Sciences Center said most of the current supply ofhealth providers is urban-based. The report proposed recruiting nurse practitioners, who require less training and can perform a lot of the procedures a physician can, could help ease the shortage.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#0a365e", "description": "New Mexico officials say the state is facing its worst shortage of primary care providers at a time when thousands are expected to enroll in state and federal health insurance exchanges.", "title": "Doctor shortage in New Mexico expected to worsen", "og": {"site_name": "Modern Healthcare", "description": "New Mexico officials say the state is facing its worst shortage of primary care providers at a time when thousands are expected to enroll in state and federal health insurance exchanges.", "title": "Doctor shortage in New Mexico expected to worsen", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140112/INFO/301129996", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-fb-lg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com", "description": "New Mexico officials say the state is facing its worst shortage of primary care providers at a time when thousands are expected to enroll in state and federal health insurance exchanges.", "creator": "@modrnhealthcr", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-twitter.jpg", "title": "Doctor shortage in New Mexico expected to worsen", "site": "@modrnhealthcr", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Modern Healthcare", "published_at": "2014-01-12", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "url": "http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140112/INFO/301129996", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-TileImage": "https:/raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/ms-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modernhealthcare/mh-logo/master/mh-logo-g-plus.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde3f9\"", "article_summary": "\"But I think as people come into the system, that we're going to see ... longer waits for primary care appointments.\"\nThe latest figures show the state has 1,429 active primary physicians but another 219 are needed, based on the population.\n\"Expanding Medicaid was the right thing to do for New Mexico,\" Martinez said last week.\nA report by the UNM Health Sciences Center said most of the current supply ofhealth providers is urban-based.\nThey include beefing up loan repayment programs and adding new positions for primary care physicians and nurse practitioners at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center."}
