The teenager who was hit by a Lee County Sheriff's deputy while riding his bike to school has died from his injuries.

15-year-old Austin Dukette was a freshman at Mariner High School in Cape Coral. He was hit while riding his bike along Kismet Parkway early Friday morning.

Dukette was airlifted to a Tampa hospital for treatment where he died on Saturday.

Friends of the teenager were shocked to hear the news.

"Out of all the people it could of happened to, it happened to one of my best friends," said 14-year-old Brenden McCarthy, who met Dukette when the two attended Caloosa Middle School.

McCarthy said the two played in a band together called The Call of the Haunted.

He described Dukette as a good friend who loved to make people smile through his music.

We spoke to one of Dukette's parents, who say they made the decision to donate their son's organs so he can continue to help others.

They told us that Austin Dukette's memorial service will be Tuesday at 7 p.m. and will be held at the Faith Presbyterian Church, 4544 Coronado Parkway in Cape Coral.

Cape Coral police are continuing to investigate the crash.

The deputy who hit Dukette -- Douglas Hood -- did not wish to speak to us on Saturday.

Monday, several Cape Coral residents plan to call for action at the council meeting asking for safer roads. A council representative would not comment Sunday but did say they have considered changes to some of the roads.

One idea would be to drop the speed limits in some of the residential neighborhoods from 30 to 25 mph.
