They would play grownup and pretend to drive while holding their dolls.\n\nThey didn\u2019t have any running water\u2014\u201cwe didn\u2019t have an outside toilet either, we used to just go way out in the woods,\u201d she says laughing.\n\nShe talks about catching crawdads by hand, and cooking by the creek.\n\nMaking medicine involved boiling roots in her day. She mentioned hickory being good for cough. \u201cThey say sassafras is good for everything\u2014I like sassafras tea.\u201d\n\n\u201cA long time ago we had little country stores around here, we didn\u2019t have to go to town, but now there\u2019s no little stores around here anymore,\u201d she says she used to walk to the store.\n\nWatch the full video below:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cherokee Elder Betty Sixkiller talks about growing up in Leach, Oklahoma, the toys they had, and the medicines they used.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/17/video-cherokee-elder-betty-sixkiller-talks-herbal-medicines-and-old-time-toys-160332", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/cherokee-elder-betty-sixkiller.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Video: Cherokee Elder Betty Sixkiller Talks Herbal Medicines and Old-Time Toys"}, "abstract": "Cherokee Elder Betty Sixkiller talks about growing up in Leach, Oklahoma, the toys they had, and the medicines they used.", "keywords": "Cherokee Elders, Cherokee Nation, Native American History", "dc": {"title": "Video: Cherokee Elder Betty Sixkiller Talks Herbal Medicines and Old-Time Toys"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/05/17/video-cherokee-elder-betty-sixkiller-talks-herbal-medicines-and-old-time-toys-160332", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.date": "2015-05-17T10:00-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Video: Cherokee Elder Betty Sixkiller Talks Herbal Medicines and Old-Time Toys"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0950\"", "article_summary": "Cherokee Elder Betty Sixkiller talks about growing up in Leach, Oklahoma.\n\u201cWe used to play marbles, or little cars,\u201d she says in the video.\nShe talks a lot about how kids played when she grew up.\nThey didn\u2019t have any running water\u2014\u201cwe didn\u2019t have an outside toilet either, we used to just go way out in the woods,\u201d she says laughing.\nAnd all the kids would use an old car parked in the woods like a playground."}
