The medical center\u2019s president, Ken Sable, bemoaned the state\u2019s declining reimbursement rates to hospitals and said that as charity care funding has gone down amid an expansion of Medicaid, \u201clet\u2019s look to hopefully reallocate some of that money to solving our behavioral health problems, which are enormous in this state.\u201d\n\nEven though his administration plans to cut $279 million from charity care funding to hospitals over two years, Christie said he is adding $127 million in the coming budget specifically for addiction treatment and behavioral health services. But if hospitals end up using those funds on other services \u2013 or taking it to boost their \u201cbottom lines\u201d \u2013 Christie would pull the money the following year, he warned.\n\n\u201cI want to see the results,\u201d Christie said. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t see the results \u2026 then I\u2019m going to have to go in another direction for the resources that the state has.\u201d\n\nResponding to Sable, Christie threatened to reallocate the $127 million to other parts of the state budget if access to addiction and mental health services does not increase over the next fiscal year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to see whether the health care system in the state just takes that money and puts it to their bottom line or whether in fact they expand access to care,\u201d Christie said. \u201cWhat the hospitals have told me all along is, \u2018Well we don\u2019t have more access to this kind of care because your reimbursements are so awful.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cNow I\u2019m going to see whether or not there\u2019s going to be more beds allocated to this, both on the behavioral side and the addiction side. Because if not, I will tell you that in next year\u2019s budget, you think charity care is a problem this year? I will take that $127 million out of charity care, and then you all can take that off your bottom line.\u201d\n\nAn increase in health insurance coverage facilitated by the President Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act has allowed Christie to cut funding for hospitals that provide charity care in New Jersey, without patients suffering devastating consequences.\n\nChristie opposes the Affordable Care Act, or \u201cObamacare,\u201d and promised to repeal it during his short-lived campaign for the presidency. But New Jersey taxpayers and the governor\u2019s budgets have gotten significant relief under the federal law.\n\nThe governor chose to expand New Jersey\u2019s Medicaid program, NJ FamilyCare, under provisions of the Affordable Care Act in 2013. That move will have provided insurance to more than 450,000 in New Jersey by next year, according to state Treasury Department estimates.\n\nAnd thousands of other state residents have acquired coverage through a separate part of the Affordable Care Act that established a new online marketplace for health insurance, known as a \u201cfederal exchange.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore than 700,000 additional New Jerseyans have signed up for health insurance since 2012 via the expansion of NJ FamilyCare and launch of the federal exchange,\u201d acting state Treasurer Ford M. Scudder testified at a budget hearing Thursday.\n\nObamacare\u2019s expansion of health insurance coverage has reduced the need for charity care, the state reimbursement program to hospitals that treat people with low incomes and are either underinsured or uninsured, according to the Christie administration.\n\nNow, amid a budget crunch, Christie intends to cut $279 million from charity care funding over two years. He cut $104 million in the current year\u2019s budget and is proposing to cut $175 million in the next. Because the federal government provides matching funds for charity care, the $175 million cut planned for next year would lead to a net reduction of $350 million for charity care in New Jersey.\n\n\u201cWe very much appreciate the expansion of Medicaid and the behavioral health funding the governor spoke about today,\u201d said Kerry McKean Kelly, spokeswoman for the New Jersey Hospital Association.\n\nBut she noted that New Jersey hospitals \u201ccontinue to provide more than half a billion dollars in charity care services despite the expansion of Medicaid and some of the improvements we've seen from the Affordable Care Act,\u201d citing statistics from 2014.\n\n\u201cWe have to remember that there are still large numbers of New Jerseyans who still don't have health insurance and under the Affordable Care Act will still not get health insurance,\u201d such as undocumented immigrants, McKean Kelly said.\n\nState Sen. Teresa Ruiz, D-Essex, said the Christie Administration must take steps to ensure that hospitals that continue to provide charity care do not lose their state funding.\n\n\u201cI hear what you're saying,\u201d she told Scudder at Thursday\u2019s budget hearing. \u201cAll these other things are supposed to alleviate some of the costs. I have a hospital in my district that \u2026 is still seeing a $12.5 million deficit in charity care. You\u2019re talking about a hospital that\u2019s in the south Newark ward. The consumer that is coming into the emergency room is predominantly using charity care.\u201d\n\nEmail: racioppi@northjersey.com", "article_metadata": {"apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "\u201cI want to see the results,\u201d Christie said. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t see the results \u2026 then I\u2019m going to have to go in another direction for the resources that the state has.\u201d", "copyright": "North Jersey Media Group Inc.", "author": "SALVADOR RIZZO and DUSTIN RACIOPPI", "og": {"url": "http://www.northjersey.com/cm/2.1593/news/christie-threatens-cuts-if-hospitals-don-t-produce-results-on-drug-addiction-treatment-1.1601957", "site_name": "NorthJersey.com", "image": "http://www.northjersey.com:80/polopoly_fs/1.1532984!/fileImage/httpImage/christie.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "\u201cI want to see the results,\u201d Christie said. \u201cAnd if I don\u2019t see the results \u2026 then I\u2019m going to have to go in another direction for the resources that the state has.\u201d"}, "title": "Christie threatens cuts if hospitals don't produce results on drug addiction treatment", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632", "fb": {"admins": "100002050123125,739916158,1235266096", "app_id": 130358300392751}, "DC.creator": "SALVADOR RIZZO and DUSTIN RACIOPPI", "msvalidate.01": "697A26605161B513EFE2AD6E581F4AA8", "google-site-verification": "swyvR_LXSGMOxOz1638gujs38OoVP3sZwJgdjySjnXM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=yes", "DC.title": "Christie threatens cuts if hospitals don't produce results on drug addiction treatment"}, "article_summary": "Because if not, I will tell you that in next year\u2019s budget, you think charity care is a problem this year?\nNow, amid a budget crunch, Christie intends to cut $279 million from charity care funding over two years.\nI have a hospital in my district that \u2026 is still seeing a $12.5 million deficit in charity care.\nBecause the federal government provides matching funds for charity care, the $175 million cut planned for next year would lead to a net reduction of $350 million for charity care in New Jersey.\nHe cut $104 million in the current year\u2019s budget and is proposing to cut $175 million in the next."}
