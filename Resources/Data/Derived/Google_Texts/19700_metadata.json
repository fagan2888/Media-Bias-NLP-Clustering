Mark Udall against Republican Rep. Cory Gardner, who is in his second term in the House.\n\nThe advertising battle has largely focused on women\u2019s issues, including birth control and abortion. As a late September Denver Post article noted, if the race were a movie, \u201cthe set would be a gynecologist\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nThe focus is at least partly due to an anti-abortion \u201cpersonhood\u201d initiative that\u2019s once again on the ballot in Colorado after having been defeated twice previously. Gardner announced in March that he no longer supported the state measure, because it could, as opponents have said, lead to a ban on some forms of birth control. Ever since, the Udall campaign has released ad after ad on the issue, and Gardner kept the birth-control theme going when he called for the sale of birth control pills over-the-counter without a prescription.\n\nBeyond confusing, and misleading, contraception claims, we\u2019ve fact-checked third-party ads attacking Udall on the Affordable Care Act and energy. Here are our findings so far in this toss-up race.\n\nClaim: Gardner embarked on an \u201ceight-year crusade that would ban birth control.\u201d\n\nFacts: Gardner supported anti-abortion measures that don\u2019t explicitly call for a ban on birth control but could lead to some forms of birth control being illegal.\n\nThe claim, made in numerous ads by the Udall campaign, refers to Gardner\u2019s support for past personhood initiatives in Colorado, which defined a person as \u201cany human being from the moment of fertilization,\u201d or the \u201cbeginning of the biological development.\u201d Gardner supported these measures in 2008 and 2010 and said on a 2006 questionnaire for Colorado Right to Life that he would support a federal personhood bill.\n\nA personhood measure is again on the ballot in Colorado this November. However, Gardner has withdrawn his support, saying that he now agrees that the personhood measure \u201ccan ban common forms of contraception.\u201d He remains, though, a co-sponsor of the federal Life at Conception Act, which similarly defines \u201chuman person\u201d from the \u201cmoment of fertilization.\u201d\n\nThese measures don\u2019t explicitly ban common birth control methods. Some hormonal forms of birth control, including the pill and intrauterine devices, prevent ovulation but can also prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. That\u2019s why these personhood measures \u2014 which say the rights afforded to a person would begin at the moment of fertilization \u2014 could lead to a ban on those forms of birth control, a matter that would likely be decided by the courts. In a 2012 statement opposing personhood amendments, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said \u201coral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and other forms of FDA-approved hormonal contraceptives could be banned in states that adopt \u2018personhood\u2019 measures.\u201d\n\nBut the Udall campaign goes too far in saying that Gardner was on a crusade that \u201cwould ban birth control.\u201d Not all birth control could be affected, and the ad doesn\u2019t note that Gardner has now changed his mind and doesn\u2019t support the state initiative.\n\nFull story: \u201cA Fight Over Birth Control in Colorado,\u201d Aug. 15\n\nClaim: The federal Life at Conception Act, which Gardner co-sponsored, wouldn\u2019t affect birth control.\n\nFacts: While Gardner says the Colorado personhood initiatives could \u201cban common forms of contraception,\u201d he maintains that the federal bill couldn\u2019t have the same effect. But the measures include the same language about giving the rights of a person to a fertilized egg.\n\nGardner announced his change of position in Colorado eight months after he signed on as a co-sponsor to the federal Life at Conception Act, which would extend \u201cequal protection for the right to life\u201d under the 14th Amendment to the \u201cpreborn\u201d from the \u201cmoment of fertilization.\u201d That language is exactly what raises the question of what such a measure would mean for some forms of birth control. Yet Gardner\u2019s campaign told us he was not withdrawing his support for the federal legislation. Spokesman Alex Siciliano told us by email: \u201cThe federal proposal in question simply states that life begins at conception, as most pro-life Americans believe, with no change to contraception laws.\u201d\n\nIn a recent local TV interview, Gardner maintained that \u201cthere is no federal personhood bill.\u201d But the Life at Conception Act explicitly defines the term \u201chuman person.\u201d In fact, supporters of the bill in Congress describe it as a \u201cpersonhood\u201d measure. Sen. Rand Paul, who introduced the bill\u2019s counterpart in the Senate, also says the legislation is aimed at establishing \u201cpersonhood\u201d for the unborn. The activist group Personhood USA calls Paul\u2019s measure a \u201cpersonhood bill.\u201d\n\nJennifer Mason, a spokeswoman for the Yes on Amendment 67 Campaign, which supports the Colorado ballot measure, told Colorado public radio station KUNC: \u201c[T]here\u2019s no reason for [Gardner] to pull local support while he\u2019s still 100 percent behind the federal amendment. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\nFull story: \u201cA Fight Over Birth Control in Colorado,\u201d Aug. 15\n\nClaim: Gardner is co-sponsoring a bill that \u201cmakes all abortions illegal, even in cases of rape and incest.\u201d\n\nFacts: This claim, made in a DSCC ad, is a debatable opinion, not a fact. The anti-abortion measure in question makes no mention of rape or incest, and it\u2019s far from clear what its impact would be.\n\nThe ad takes another stab at Gardner\u2019s co-sponsorship of the Life at Conception Act. The National Pro-Life Alliance argues that this bill would \u201cdismantle\u201d the Roe v. Wade decision, because the majority opinion in Roe v. Wade said that if a fetus can be considered a \u201cperson\u201d under the Constitution, \u201cthe fetus\u2019 right to life is then guaranteed specifically by the [14th] Amendment.\u201d\n\nEven if that turns out to be accurate, that still falls short of necessarily making \u201call\u201d abortions illegal \u201ceven in cases of rape or incest.\u201d Sen. Paul, the leading sponsor on the related (and almost identical) Senate bill, has refused to make that claim. He was asked on CNN whether he \u201cwould have no exceptions for rape, incest, the life of the mother.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat I would say is that there are thousands of exceptions. I\u2019m a physician and every individual case is going to be different.\u201d A spokesman for Paul later tried to clarify that, telling an anti-abortion news website that Paul was trying to say that \u201ca singular exception to save the life of the mother would likely cover thousands of individual cases.\u201d\n\nSo, we find that the ad goes too far in claiming Gardner\u2019s bill would \u201cmake all abortions illegal,\u201d without exception.\n\nFull story: \u201cAbortion Distortions 2014,\u201d Sept. 26\n\nClaim: Gardner\u2019s plan to make birth control pills over-the-counter would be \u201ccheaper and easier for you.\u201d\n\nFacts: It\u2019s unclear whether birth control pills would be \u201ccheaper\u201d if they were available over-the-counter without a prescription, a plan Gardner touts in a campaign ad. The available research is mixed, and it\u2019s not specifically about the pill.\n\nA 2012 study funded by the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, a trade group for manufacturers of over-the-counter drugs, said there were savings from having common ailment drugs over-the-counter and that most of the savings came from not needing an office visit to get a prescription. The Oral Contraceptives OTC Working Group, which was established in 2004 to explore this issue, cites both a 2002 study that found out-of-pocket costs for consumers went up when certain drugs moved from prescription to OTC status, and research from 2005 that found out-of-pocket costs decreased for other drugs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unclear what would happen to the price of an oral contraceptive if it went over the counter,\u201d said Sneha Barot, senior public policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute. She told us the cost of emergency contraception \u2014 which is essentially a high dose of the birth control pill \u2014 went up a bit when it became available without a prescription.\n\nOTC pills would not be cheaper for women with most private insurance coverage, who \u2014 under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 get full coverage of the pill (and other forms of female contraception), with no cost-sharing, and fully covered annual \u201cwell-woman\u201d office visits during which they can get a prescription. As for getting the pill over-the-counter being \u201ceasier,\u201d that, too, depends on the person. If the cost were covered through a reimbursement system, as Gardner proposes, women would have to take whatever steps were required to get their money back. Women in rural areas, as Gardner pointed out in an op-ed on this topic, may drive long distances to see a doctor and would likely find an OTC option easier.\n\nLastly, Gardner\u2019s proposal couldn\u2019t be authorized by an act of Congress. Instead, a drug manufacturer would submit an application to the FDA, and the FDA would then have to review and approve it.\n\nFull story: \u201cColorado\u2019s Contraception Controversy,\u201d Sept. 16\n\nClaim: Gardner wants to \u201ctake away\u201d insurance coverage for birth control pills and have \u201cwomen pay for all of it.\u201d\n\nFacts: Gardner hasn\u2019t called for any kind of ban on insurance coverage of the pill, or birth control in general.\n\nA Planned Parenthood Votes ad claims that Gardner\u2019s plan would \u201ctake away\u201d coverage for the pill, with an on-screen graphic that reads, \u201cGardner\u2019s plan: Women pay for all of it.\u201d The Udall campaign, too, has criticized Gardner\u2019s OTC proposal by saying on its website that he had a \u201cradical position on ending insurance coverage for the pill.\u201d\n\nGardner\u2019s campaign says he wants to allow women to be reimbursed by their insurance for over-the-counter oral contraceptives. He hasn\u2019t provided more specific details on how his plan would work, but that\u2019s still no reason for Planned Parenthood Votes to misrepresent his proposal.\n\nEven if the ACA were repealed (which Gardner does want), many insurers may still cover some of the cost of prescription contraceptives, as they did before the ACA. (In fact, Colorado, like the majority of states, requires insurance plans that include prescription drug coverage to cover contraception. Gardner voted against his state\u2019s contraception coverage bill in 2010.)\n\nFull story: \u201cColorado\u2019s Contraception Controversy,\u201d Sept. 16\n\nClaim: \u201cMany Coloradans pay roughly 100% more for health insurance since Obamacare.\u201d\n\nFacts: To make this false claim, Crossroads GPS exaggerates a few personal anecdotes about resort area residents\u2019 premiums on the individual market, where only about 7 percent of Coloradans get insurance. Also, the total population of the resort area counties is just 3 percent of the state\u2019s 5 million residents.\n\nWhile the announcer in the ad claims that \u201cmany\u201d Coloradans had faced such an increase, an on-screen graphic reads: \u201cresort area residents paying roughly 100 percent more for health insurance.\u201d That\u2019s a truncated quote from the Aspen Daily News, which said \u201csome resort area residents,\u201d not \u201cmany\u201d were paying that much more. The story gave two personal anecdotes of a couple who say they\u2019re paying about double and a woman who says she\u2019s paying 66 percent more since the Affordable Care Act.\n\nResort area residents faced higher health care costs before the ACA. It\u2019s unclear whether the law caused an overall increase in the individual market premiums.\n\nComparing pre- and post-ACA premiums on the individual market is difficult, if not impossible because of the law\u2019s regulations on coverage requirements and how insurers can and can\u2019t vary premiums.\n\nFull story: \u201cA Game of Telephone in Colorado,\u201d Sept. 5\n\nClaim: \u201cOn the eastern plains, patients now outnumber doctors five thousand to one.\u201d\n\nFacts: Crossroads GPS uses a statistic from a study conducted before the major provisions of the ACA were implemented to imply that the law caused a shortage of doctors in rural areas.\n\nThe data is from a 2013 study by the Colorado Health Institute, and it\u2019s the first time such a study was conducted. The Crossroads ad says this is \u201cnow\u201d the case, as if there\u2019s been a change, but we don\u2019t know what the situation was in the past. The Health Institute\u2019s Amy Downs confirmed that the study wasn\u2019t blaming the ACA for the problem. \u201cBecause the analysis was conducted prior to the launch of the major insurance reforms in the ACA, we don\u2019t attribute the Affordable Care Act as a reason why there are few primary care physicians on the eastern plains,\u201d she said in an email to FactCheck.org.\n\nThe study gives several other reasons for the challenging situation \u2014 fewer physicians choosing to be primary care physicians, an aging population that needs more care, and doctors who are also aging and retiring.\n\nFull story: \u201cA Game of Telephone in Colorado,\u201d Sept. 5\n\nClaim: A Colorado woman \u201chad to go back to work\u201d to pay for ACA-mandated insurance.\n\nFacts: Another ad from Crossroads GPS leaves the false impression that a Colorado woman \u201chad to go back to work\u201d to pay for health care insurance mandated by the Affordable Care Act. She told a local TV station that her decision to get a job had nothing to do with the health care law.\n\nIn the ad, Richelle McKim of Castle Rock, Colorado, talks about the expense to her and her husband of buying health insurance. \u201cWe knew that we needed to find health care,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause we were a single-income family, we couldn\u2019t afford our plan.\u201d Meanwhile, the on-screen text reads: \u201cRichelle had to go back to work.\u201d The impression left by the ad\u2019s deceptive framing is that she had to go back to work in order to afford a health care policy on Connect for Health Colorado, the state website created under the Affordable Care Act to purchase nongroup insurance policies. That\u2019s not what happened.\n\nRichelle worked for her husband\u2019s company, Mission Basement, from July 2008 to May 2010. Her LinkedIn page, which has since been removed from the site, says that she left to work at Anadarko Petroleum in May 2010 \u2014 more than three years before the ACA\u2019s individual mandate took effect. Richelle then told KDVR that \u201cit wasn\u2019t the Affordable Care Act\u201d that influenced her decision to go back to work.\n\nFull story: \u201cCrossroads GPS\u2019 Twisted Tale,\u201d Aug. 12\n\nClaim: Udall \u201cvoted to enact a carbon tax.\u201d\n\nFacts: Udall voted to support making a hypothetical tax revenue neutral, and the resolution did not carry the force of law. Congress has never voted to enact a specific carbon tax proposal.\n\nThe Crossroads GPS ad making this claim points to Udall\u2019s March 22, 2013, vote for a nonbinding budget resolution amendment to require any possible future carbon tax to be revenue neutral, with the money the government would receive from the tax being returned to the American people. Crossroads could accurately have said that Udall supports revenue neutrality in the case that a carbon tax is ever enacted, but that wouldn\u2019t make for a very powerful attack.\n\nA carbon tax is a direct tax on the carbon content of fossil-fuel energy, such as coal, oil and gas. The idea faces much political opposition.\n\nThe ad goes on to wrongly say that Udall voted for a carbon tax proposal that \u201ccould have led to higher electricity prices, squeezing middle-class budgets,\u201d vaguely adding: \u201cA carbon tax could squeeze local businesses and hurt Colorado employment.\u201d The Congressional Budget Office says that such a tax could do those things, depending on how it was structured and how the revenues were used. But, again, Udall didn\u2019t vote on a specific proposal.\n\nFull story: \u201cMore Carbon Tax Distortions,\u201d July 24\n\nClaim: Udall \u201cvoted to take away your gun rights.\u201d\n\nFacts: He\u2019s not against people owning guns or using them in self-defense in their homes, despite what an ominous NRA ad implies.\n\nThe ad shows a woman home alone with her baby as an intruder breaks through the front door. It says, \u201cHow you defend yourself is up to you,\u201d adding: \u201cBut Mark Udall voted to take away your gun rights. Vote like your safety depends on it.\u201d The NRA stretches Udall\u2019s record to make that claim, citing his support for expanded background checks at gun shows and over the Internet, and legislation to regulate large capacity ammunition feeding devices. On the same day as those votes, Udall also voted against an assault weapons ban and in favor of cross-state reciprocity for the carrying of concealed firearms.\n\nHe didn\u2019t support policies that might prevent homeowners from being able to protect themselves against a violent intruder, as the ad suggests.\n\nFull story: \u201cNRA\u2019s Ominous But Misleading Appeal,\u201d Oct. 3\n\n\u2013 The Staff of FactCheck.org", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca836\"", "article_summary": "Full story: \u201cA Fight Over Birth Control in Colorado,\u201d Aug. 15Claim: The federal Life at Conception Act, which Gardner co-sponsored, wouldn\u2019t affect birth control.\nFacts: While Gardner says the Colorado personhood initiatives could \u201cban common forms of contraception,\u201d he maintains that the federal bill couldn\u2019t have the same effect.\nRichelle then told KDVR that \u201cit wasn\u2019t the Affordable Care Act\u201d that influenced her decision to go back to work.\nColorado\u2019s Senate race pits Democratic freshman Sen.
