Your ♡bamaCare!!! Fail of the Day

I realize a million is little more than a rounding error when it comes to federal spending, but you know what they say -- a million here, a million there, and pretty soon you're talking real money.

So here's eight of those:

The IRS mistakenly overpaid more than $8 million to HealthCare.gov customers and Obamacare users in California, and cheated tens of thousands of others out of nearly $2 million in 2015 because the government relied on incorrect information to figure their taxes, an audit revealed Tuesday. About 70,850 filers received $8.3 million in federal subsidies that they didn’t deserve, while roughly 69,400 taxpayers missed out on $1.9 million they should have got, based on a review of returns filed between late January and late May in 2015, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said. The problem stemmed from erroneous forms the government sent to about 800,000 customers, which used the wrong benchmark to measure what their Obamacare payments should have been.

Given what people are required to pay for coverage they don't seem to want with mandated extra benefits they'll never use, with copays and deductibles many of them can't afford, I'm going to chalk up this Fail as a Win.
