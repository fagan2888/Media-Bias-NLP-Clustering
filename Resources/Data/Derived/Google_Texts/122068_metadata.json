(AP) \u2014 With the deadly ambush on a state police barracks in the Pocono Mountains, law enforcement in eastern Pennsylvania went on high alert and officers from throughout the region, including New York and New Jersey, joined in a massive search for the shooter or shooters.\n\nBut after scouring dense woods on foot and by helicopter Saturday, authorities suspected the assailant had left the area. They had no one in custody as midnight neared, a state police spokesman said.\n\nPennsylvania State Police Commissioner Frank Noonan said the attack Friday night that left one trooper dead and another critically wounded was directed at state police and a \u201cvery dangerous, armed criminal\u201d eluded quick capture.\n\n\u201cThis attack was an ambush. Our troopers were \u2026 shot without warning and really had no chance to defend themselves,\u201d Noonan told reporters Saturday afternoon. \u201cIt\u2019s a cowardly attack. It\u2019s an attack upon all of us in society.\u201d\n\nLaw enforcement officers searched state game lands surrounding the barracks in Blooming Grove, in Pike County, and beyond Saturday. Several roads around the barracks, including parts of Interstate 84, were closed.\n\n\u201cThere has been an exhaustive search conducted by hundreds of members of law enforcement,\u201d said Lt. Colonel George Bivens. \u201cWe have canvassed the wooded areas, neighborhoods. We are convinced this individual is no longer in that immediate area.\u201d\n\nPolice interviewed a man they called a \u201cperson of interest,\u201d but Noonan said authorities are talking to hundreds of people as part of the investigation. He stressed the man is not a suspect.\n\nThe troopers were ambushed around 10:50 p.m. Friday as one of them was leaving the barracks and another was arriving. Cpl. Bryon Dickson of Dunmore was killed and Trooper Alex Douglass was injured.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Police: Deadly ambush \u2018has touched us to the core\u2019", "title": "Police: Deadly ambush \u2018has touched us to the core\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Police: Deadly ambush \u2018has touched us to the core\u2019", "title": "Police: Deadly ambush \u2018has touched us to the core\u2019", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/14/police_deadly_ambush_has_touched_us_to_the_core/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/police-barracks-shooting-.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Police: Deadly ambush \u2018has touched us to the core\u2019", "title": "Police: Deadly ambush \u2018has touched us to the core\u2019", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/police-barracks-shooting-.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michael Rubinkam", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d4f\"", "article_summary": "The troopers were ambushed around 10:50 p.m. Friday as one of them was leaving the barracks and another was arriving.\nIt\u2019s an attack upon all of us in society.\u201dLaw enforcement officers searched state game lands surrounding the barracks in Blooming Grove, in Pike County, and beyond Saturday.\nBut after scouring dense woods on foot and by helicopter Saturday, authorities suspected the assailant had left the area.\nOur troopers were \u2026 shot without warning and really had no chance to defend themselves,\u201d Noonan told reporters Saturday afternoon.\nThey had no one in custody as midnight neared, a state police spokesman said."}
