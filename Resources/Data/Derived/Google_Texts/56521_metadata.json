Now you can. The Affordable Care Act has transformed the insurance market by putting dozens of competing insurance plans online in one place.\n\nThe Maryland Health Connection \u2013 www.marylandhealthconnection.gov \u2013 is the statewide insurance marketplace. Anyone can compare price and coverage on the website.\n\nIndividuals who are covered by Medicare don\u2019t need to do anything. Nothing changes for them.\n\nFor everyone else, including adults between 18 and 64 and uninsured children, the website is the place to look.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a computer to connect to the Internet, or can\u2019t use a computer, you can get trained assistance from \u201cnavigators\u201d and \u201cassisters\u201d by just walking in or calling. For the first two weeks in October, Kent County\u2019s navigators will be in predetermined places.\n\nEach private insurance company in the state health exchange has to offer four plans, which fall into categories called Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. Each category corresponds to a minimum standard of benefits.\n\nJust like the Olympics, a Bronze plan is the lowest ranked. It has the least cost and coverage.\n\nSilver is better, Gold better still. Platinum is the \u201cCadillac plan.\u201d\n\nA navigator\u2019s job is to help with choosing a plan, based on certain information about an individual or family.\n\nAmanda Nelson is the lead navigator for Kent County\u2019s region, called the Upper Eastern Shore.\n\nPhillip Shank is Kent County\u2019s navigator. Alison Farmer is the assister.\n\nHope Clark is the Queen Anne\u2019s County navigator for those who have a Kent mailing address but live south of the river.\n\nThe Health Connection has a hotline for anyone who would like to ask questions or get additional help from a navigator. It is 855-642-8572, open from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Friday.\n\nStarting today, Kent\u2019s navigators will be at a different location in Chestertown each weekday. As time goes on, they will announce stops elsewhere in the county.\n\nNelson and Farmer will be at Monday night\u2019s Chestertown council meeting at 7 p.m. in town hall.\n\nShank and Farmer will discuss outreach with the Kent commissioners on Tuesday, Oct. 8, at 6 p.m. at 400 High St.\n\n\u2022Mondays: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Kent County Health Department, 125 S. Lynchburg St.\n\n\u2022Tuesdays: 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Department of Social Services office, 350 High St.\n\n\u2022Wednesdays: 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Kent County Public Library, Yellow Building on Calvert St.\n\n\u2022Thursdays: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Shared Opportunity Service, 601 High St.\n\n\u2022Fridays: 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Upper Shore Aging, Amy Lynn Ferris Center, 200 Schauber Rd.\n\nOn Oct. 28, the Maryland Health Connection Bus Tour will stop at Fountain Park from noon to 5 p.m.\n\nTo work with a navigator, it is necessary to have basic information ready. For everyone who will be on the plan, have:\n\n\u2022Birthdates;\n\n\u2022Current health insurance policy numbers, if any;\n\n\u2022Information about any job-related health insurance available;\n\n\u2022Social Security numbers;\n\n\u2022Document numbers for legal immigrants who need insurance.\n\nAlso, since tax rebates are used to lower the cost of insurance for people who qualify for a subsidy, bring employer and income information for everyone in your family (for example, pay stubs, W-2 forms or wage and tax statements).\n\nNavigators work for a nonprofit agency to get people informed and signed on to health plans. For Kent County, the company is New York-based Seedco.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "MyEasternShoreMD", "description": "CHESTERTOWN \u2014 Want to shop for health insurance?
