Diets high in these compounds have been linked to a reduced risk for chronic diseases, including heart disease and some cancers.\n\nSome small trials have found that drinking pomegranate juice daily may improve vascular health, blood pressure and levels of \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol.\n\nThere is also research showing that pomegranate extract inhibits the growth of prostate, breast, colon and lung cancer cells in lab cultures, and may inhibit the growth of some tumors in animals. Human trials are now looking at whether pomegranate juice can help slow prostate cancer progression.\n\nPomegranate may affect how we metabolize some medications, Bauer warned, so people on blood thinners or blood pressure drugs called ACE inhibitors may want to talk to their doctors if they eat a lot of the fruit.\n\n\u2014 Roni Caryn Rabin, The New York Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2011/12/POMEGRANATE.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Q: Are pomegranates good for you?\nSome small trials have found that drinking pomegranate juice daily may improve vascular health, blood pressure and levels of \u201cgood\u201d HDL cholesterol.\nA: Pomegranates are rich in micronutrients with potential antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and are often compared favorably with red wine and green tea.\nHuman trials are now looking at whether pomegranate juice can help slow prostate cancer progression.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a suggestion pomegranate can do a lot of things,\u201d Bauer said."}
