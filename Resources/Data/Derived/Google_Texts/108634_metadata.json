In addition, 73% of respondents say narrow networks allowed by insurers have caused disruption in necessary care, and another 67% say primary care physicians are sending patients to emergency departments to receive medical tests or procedures when health insurers refuse to cover them in an office setting.\u201cThis is a scary environment for patients,\u201d said ACEP President Jay Kaplan, MD. \u201cMany patients are motivated by fear of costs and not by the seriousness of their medical conditions. The insurance companies are shifting costs onto patients and medical providers as they attempt to increase their bottom lines, and this threatens the foundation of our nation\u2019s medical care system.\u201cThey call it cost-cutting when in reality it is profit-boosting. In addition, health insurance companies are shrinking the number of doctors available in their networks making it more likely that patients will be forced into out-of-network situations.\u201dOther findings from the survey include:\"Insurance industry claims about 'surprise bills' are disingenuous since they created the 'heads I win, tails you lose' environment,\" said Dr. Kaplan. \"Balance billing would not even exist if health plans paid what is known as 'usual and customary' payment in the insurance industry \u2014 what is also known as 'fair payment.' Emergency patients are especially vulnerable because health plans know that emergency departments never turn anyone away. Health insurers have been taking gross advantage of patients and medical providers since the Affordable Care Act (ACA) took effect, arbitrarily slashing reimbursements to physicians by as much as 70%. Patients and physicians should band together to fight these dangerous insurance industry practices.\"Kaplan also questioned why four of the largest insurance companies had the resources to merge, given the ACA requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of premium revenue on medical care.\"Isn't the goal of the 'Affordable Care Act' to make health care more affordable?\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/insurers-to-blame-for-poor-us-medical-care-trade-group-says-26135.aspx", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/healthcare%20costs.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 200}, "site_name": "Insurance Business", "description": "A new poll of emergency physicians says an increasing number of Americans are shirking necessary medical care, to the fault of insurance companies.", "title": "Insurers to blame for poor US medical care, trade group says"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new poll of emergency physicians says an increasing number of Americans are shirking necessary medical care, to the fault of insurance companies.", "title": "Insurers to blame for poor US medical care, trade group says", "url": "http://www.ibamag.com/news/insurers-to-blame-for-poor-us-medical-care-trade-group-says-26135.aspx", "image": "http://www.ibamag.com/files/image/Insurance%20Business/healthcare%20costs.jpg", "site": "@InsuranceBizUS", "card": "summary"}, "description": "A new poll of emergency physicians says an increasing number of Americans are shirking necessary medical care, to the fault of insurance companies.", "author": "Caitlin Bronson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0f9b\"", "article_summary": "\"Isn't the goal of the 'Affordable Care Act' to make health care more affordable?\"\n\"Kaplan also questioned why four of the largest insurance companies had the resources to merge, given the ACA requires insurers to spend at least 80 percent of premium revenue on medical care.\nEmergency patients are especially vulnerable because health plans know that emergency departments never turn anyone away.\nMore than 80% reported treating patients who said they had difficulty finding specialists to care for them, because health plans have narrow networks.\n73% reported seeing increased numbers of Medicaid patients because insurance companies were failing to provide adequate numbers of primary care or specialty physicians for their patients."}
