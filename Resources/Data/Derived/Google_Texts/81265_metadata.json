Any money captured through forfeiture instead has to be deposited into the state\u2019s general fund.\n\nBut Carpenter said despite sweeping changes in some states, too few are currently considering reforms.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Check out this map.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Check out this map.", "title": "Find Out How Easy It Is for Law Enforcement to Seize Cash, Cars, and Houses in Your State", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151110_IJForfeiture_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-10T20:05:16+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1RM2USd"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Check out this map.", "title": "Find Out How Easy It Is for Law Enforcement to Seize Cash, Cars, and Houses in Your State", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151110_IJForfeiture_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-11-10T18:24:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-10T20:05:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Institute for Justice, civil asset forfeiture, Policing for Profit, criminal forfeiture"}, "article_summary": "Further, the new law eliminated financial incentives for law enforcement agencies to seize property by prohibiting forfeiture money from funneling into agency accounts.\nBoth states, for example, allow law enforcement agencies to keep 100 percent of the value of forfeited property, which is often then funneled into the agencies\u2019 budgets.\n\u201cForfeiture laws do very little to protect rights of individuals,\u201d Carpenter told The Daily Signal.\nThose include the financial incentive for law enforcement to pursue forfeitures, the standard of proof the government must meet to seize property, and whether the burden to prove innocence falls on the property owners or the government.\nThe disputed policing tactic that enables law enforcement to seize property from people who were never convicted, or often even charged, with a crime is on the rise across the U.S., according to a report released Tuesday."}
