Although the surgery happened 60 years ago, a new study shows that the same concerns that likely prompted Richard Herrick to tell his brother to leave the hospital still trouble kidney recipients today.\n\nPatients with chronic kidney disease worry about the long-term consequences for potential donors and frequently feel unworthy of such a self-sacrificing gift, Camilla Hanson and her colleagues reported online December 1 in Transplantation.\n\n\u201cSome people don\u2019t like to be on the receiving end and don\u2019t like to ask favors,\u201d she told Reuters Health.\n\n\u201cOur study really shows that there\u2019s a whole host of emotional barriers, mainly guilt, that stop someone from asking for, and perhaps accepting, a kidney,\u201d said Hanson, a public health doctoral student at the University of Sydney in Australia.\n\nShe examined 39 studies from 13 countries with nearly 1,800 patients suffering from chronic kidney disease and identified themes that present barriers to finding living kidney donors.\n\nIn addition to guilt, patients\u2019 worries about jeopardizing donor health, about causing donor inconvenience, about donor regret and about unrelenting indebtedness ran through the literature.\n\nAnother thread in the studies - and one that resonated with nephrologists Hanson interviewed for a separate study - was that patients with chronic kidney disease did not know how to approach relatives or friends to ask for one of their two kidneys.\n\nOne American patient said, \u201cI would step up like that to give anybody else a kidney, but for me to ask somebody, I couldn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cRather than ask and get my feelings hurt, I didn\u2019t even ask,\u201d another said.\n\nOrgan transplant surgeon Dr. John Roberts told Reuters Health that his patients often hesitate to ask relatives who may want to donate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult question to pose to say, \u2018Hey, do you want to donate your kidney to me?\u2019\u201d said Roberts, chief of the University of California, San Francisco, Medical Center Transplant Service. He was not involved with the current study.\n\nKidney transplants from living donors offer optimal recipient survival outcomes, the study says. In addition, shortages of deceased donor kidneys lead to long wait times.\n\nPatients on the waiting list for a deceased donor kidney have only a one in five chance of surviving long enough to get a transplant, Roberts said. The chance for patients with diabetes shrinks to one in 10, he said.\n\n\u201cWithout a living donor, your chances of getting a transplant are pretty slim,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFrequently the children want to donate, and the parents don\u2019t want the children to donate, and their parents end up dying on dialysis,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cI think it\u2019s really the parents\u2019 fear of their children having a complication, not being able to work and not having health insurance.\u201d\n\nRoberts believes the government should offer lifetime health insurance to kidney donors as an incentive.\n\nTransplant nephrologist Dr. Peter Reese told Reuters Health he also believes lifetime health insurance would provide a fair incentive to living kidney donors.\n\n\u201cI think that would be a good idea from a justice point of view,\u201d said Reese, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia. He was not involved with the current study.\n\nIn 1954, when Ronald Herrick was preparing to donate his kidney, he asked the doctors if they would assume responsibility for his health care for the rest of his life.\n\nOne of the doctors replied that he would not. But then he assured Herrick that the medical team would feel a professional responsibility to care for him.\n\nReese, who evaluates potential kidney donors, is not in a position to make similar promises.\n\nToday, not only would Ronald Herrick have to figure out his own health insurance, he would not be considered an ideal donor, Reese said. At 23, he was too young in Reese\u2019s opinion to have established life habits that could foretell his ability to withstand losing a kidney, and he shared the same genetic predisposition for kidney disease as his twin.\n\nRichard Herrick lived eight years with his brother\u2019s kidney. Ronald Herrick died in 2010 at 79 years old.\n\n(Story by Ronnie Cohen)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "barriers to kidney transplants, organ donation, organ transplant", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A host of emotional barriers \u2014 guilt in particular \u2014 keep those in need of a new kidney from asking for and accepting donations.", "title": "Why Kidney Transplant Candidates Feel Unworthy of Their New Organs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/barriers-kidney-transplants-candidates-feel-unworthy-their-new-organs-study-shows-316066", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/02/digital-illustration-kidney.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A host of emotional barriers \u2014 guilt in particular \u2014 keep those in need of a new kidney from asking for and accepting donations.", "title": "Why Kidney Transplant Candidates Feel Unworthy of Their New Organs", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/barriers-kidney-transplants-candidates-feel-unworthy-their-new-organs-study-shows-316066", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/02/digital-illustration-kidney.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/02/digital-illustration-kidney.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-01-02T14:57:06-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-02T14:57:04-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A host of emotional barriers \u2014 guilt in particular \u2014 keep those in need of a new kidney from asking for and accepting donations."}, "article_summary": "There are currently 101,170 people awaiting a kidney transplant in the U.S., according to the National Kidney Foundation.\n\u201cI am here, and I am going to stay,\u201d Ronald Herrick responded.\nIn addition to guilt, patients\u2019 worries about jeopardizing donor health, about causing donor inconvenience, about donor regret and about unrelenting indebtedness ran through the literature.\nRonald Herrick died in 2010 at 79 years old.\nPatients on the waiting list for a deceased donor kidney have only a one in five chance of surviving long enough to get a transplant, Roberts said."}
