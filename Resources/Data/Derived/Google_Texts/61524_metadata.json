If we didn\u2019t have real enemies plotting our death and dismemberment, it might be very entertaining.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn truth, the \u201cpopulist anger\u201d fueling Trump\u2019s coalition is fundamentally different from Sanders\u2019 \u201cprogressive populism.\u201d The superficial similarities between the two end when they talk about solutions.\n\nTake, for example, their mutual opposition to the TPP, the \u201ctrade partnership\u201d agreement that has not yet been adopted by Congress. They both say they want Congress to vote NO on the TPP, but their reasons are as different as night and day, which tells you their two coalitions\u2019 \u201canger\u201d is quite different.\n\nTrump said this past week on the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d television show, \u201cHe (Sanders) knows that our country is being ripped off big league, big league on trade. The problem is he can\u2019t do anything about it.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 opposition to the TPP is a knee-jerk opposition to anything that benefits \u201cBig Business,\u201d socialism\u2019s evil witch of the East, whereas Trump says that the TPP hurts blue collar workers, who are the principal victims of socialism.\n\nSanders\u2019 coalition of millions of spoiled, narcissistic rich kids and big government addicts is worlds apart from the Trump coalition, and the two have very little in common. The anger arising from not getting a bigger welfare check, \u201cfree\u201d college education or more aggressive affirmative action entitlements is a fundamentally different animal from the anger arising from the government stealing your job by importing foreign labor.\n\nThe media will not admit that Trump\u2019s America and Sanders\u2019 America are as different as Venus and Mars: they represent a very polarized America with two different answers to the question, \u201cWho are we?\u201d\n\nAnd yet, the two campaigns are similar in one important way: in both cases, if either Sanders or Trump win the race to the White House, their most ardent supporters will be disappointed and more angry than ever. Why? Because neither candidate has a platform based on coherent principles that can deliver us from our peril. Anger is an emotion, not a compass.\n\nThe first rule in problem solving is, if you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. Instead, socialist Bernie Sanders is demanding a bigger shovel. Trump sees the hole but has a rather vague solution: \u201cTrust me on this.\u201d\n\nSanders is campaigning for the White House as an admitted socialist, and no one is shocked by that because the United States is already 80 percent of the way down the road to European-style socialism. Our establishment institutions have already adapted to that devolution from free markets to social democracy, so how radical would it be to travel the remaining distance? Sad to say, not much.\n\nThe truth is, Sanders is as much an \u201coutsider\u201d as Peyton Manning is a rookie football player. Sanders is part of the ruling class, as illustrated by his Senate voting record, which is 95 percent identical to Democrats such as Schumer and Reid. If those 45 Senate Democrat colleagues aren\u2019t socialists, what are they? Vegetarians?\n\nEvery Democrat in Congress today has drank the Kool-Aid of the \u201cliving constitution,\u201d along with half the Republicans. Expansions of government that would make Karl Marx and Benito Mussolini green with envy will find a ready justification in the \u201cliving constitution\u201d \u2013 and a Harvard or Yale law professor to sanctify it as progressive.\n\nThat\u2019s why the American left hated Supreme Court Justice Scalia. By his brilliance and his devotion to the Constitution, Scalia honored the limits of power and challenged the pretensions of judicial hubris that brings us such atrocities as Roe v. Wade and John Robert\u2019s Obamacare ruling.\n\nBy contrast, socialists like Sanders live by the hubris in their veins.\n\nBut what about the other aspiring avenger of populist anger? Hubris has many faces, and Trump has shown many of them.\n\nIf Sanders is channeling George McGovern, maybe Trump is channeling Andrew Jackson, who did in fact throw the White House open to ordinary folk. But what kind of \u201coutsider,\u201d what kind of \u201cpopulist\u201d brags about buying politicians to advance his business profits? What man of the people works hard to have Queen Hillary at his daughter\u2019s wedding and says his pro-abortion sister would make a great Supreme Court appointee?\n\nCan constitutionalists trust the mirror image of socialist Sanders to restore liberty instead of makings \u201cgreat deals\u201d with Pelosi and Putin?\n\nWhy is it rational to think either Sanders or Trump will dismantle \u201cthe establishment\u201d when both are well credentialed members of the establishment?\n\nIs Trump an outsider merely by never having held public office? Was Nelson Rockefeller an outsider when he was elected Governor of New York?\n\nBoth Trump and Sanders have something else in common besides benefiting from being the new kid on the block. None of their followers have the slightest clue about what their hero would actually DO if elected.\n\nBoth are saying, If you don\u2019t like the status quo, vote for me! I can turn the county around.\n\n\u201cBy their fruits you shall know them,\u201d but is it impolite to ask, where are their fruits?\n\nNeither Sanders nor Trump offer any details of their roadmaps to prosperity and rectitude. In proposing a \u201cleap into the unknown\u201d based mainly on distrust and anxiety, they are two sides of the same coin.\n\nThat a substantial majority of the nation appears to be willing to make that jump into the unknown is both encouraging and frightening \u2013 encouraging because it means a large majority of voters understand that the nation has veered off course, but frightening because it is clear \u201cwe the people\u201d are almost evenly divided \u2013 \u201cpolarized\u201d is the term now in vogue\u2013 over what new course to take.\n\nOur country took that plunge into the unknown in 2008. People were tired of George Bush and the Iraq quagmire, and were panicked by the economic collapse. So, the voters gambled with Obama. Can we afford to gamble like that again?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Are Trump and Sanders Two Sides of Same 'Progressive Populism' Coin?", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Are Trump and Sanders Two Sides of Same 'Progressive Populism' Coin?", "title": "Are Trump and Sanders Two Sides of Same 'Progressive Populism' Coin? - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Trump-Sign-Rally-Silent-Majority-AP.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/20/are-trump-and-sanders-two-sides-of-same-progressive-populism-coin/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Are Trump and Sanders Two Sides of Same 'Progressive Populism' Coin?", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/01/Trump-Sign-Rally-Silent-Majority-AP.jpg", "title": "Are Trump and Sanders Two Sides of Same 'Progressive Populism' Coin? - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,populism", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "published_time": "2016-02-20T09:56:31-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn truth, the \u201cpopulist anger\u201d fueling Trump\u2019s coalition is fundamentally different from Sanders\u2019 \u201cprogressive populism.\u201d The superficial similarities between the two end when they talk about solutions.\nBoth Trump and Sanders have something else in common besides benefiting from being the new kid on the block.\nWhy is it rational to think either Sanders or Trump will dismantle \u201cthe establishment\u201d when both are well credentialed members of the establishment?\nTrump said this past week on the \u201cMorning Joe\u201d television show, \u201cHe (Sanders) knows that our country is being ripped off big league, big league on trade.\nNeither Sanders nor Trump offer any details of their roadmaps to prosperity and rectitude."}
