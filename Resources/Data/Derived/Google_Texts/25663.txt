ROCK FALLS – And so it begins – “it” being construction at the Whiteside County Health Department.

Construction crews broke ground Monday on a 5,000-square-foot building going up on the back parking lot.

The health department has 13,000 clients – a number that continues to grow with the passage of the Affordable Care Act.

The new building is going to help ease overcrowding, allowing the department to offer more behavioral health services.

The expansion is made possible by a $1 million grant delivered in person in October by then-Gov. Pat Quinn.

A few months before that, Beth Fiorini, the health department’s administrator, had applied for the grant, which is part of the state Community Health Center Construction Act.

The act, adopted in 2009, provides funding to repair outdated buildings, build new facilities, and buy new equipment.

“I think this is an investment that is going to pay great dividends in health care, especially in behavioral health care,” Quinn said in October. “We want to make sure we cover every aspect of health care – physical, mental, you name it.

“We’ve added in our state, in 1 year, 711,000 people now have health care coverage under the [federal] Affordable Care Act, but we have to have places to provide that, you know? And that’s what this is all about.”

The project is expected to be finished by Christmas, Fiorini said.
