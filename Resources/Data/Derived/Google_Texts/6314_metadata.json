The majority of the country\u2019s illegal immigrants are from Mexico while the vast majority of illegal immigrants who were apprehended this summer arrived from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nVarious amnesty workshops have been held from coast to coast as amnesty advocates try to inform nearly five million illegal immigrants that they can receive Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, one illegal immigrant woman asked whether she could qualify for Obama\u2019s executive amnesty if she had a DUI. She was told, \u201capologetically,\u201d that she would not. Nearly 450,000 illegal immigrants in Los Angeles are expected to qualify for Obama\u2019s executive amnesty, but \u201cmajor questions, including what kinds of criminal records might disqualify an applicant, still loom.\u201d\n\nEchoing what Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-IL) has emphasized, Angelica Salas, the executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, reportedly said, \u201cWe\u2019re telling all our families to get ready to apply if they qualify, because the more families apply, the harder it is for Republicans to take it away.\u201d\n\nCritics of Obama\u2019s executive amnesty have said Democrats just want more \u201cundocumented Democrats\u201d to ultimately be eligible to vote. And Salas also emphasized that point, saying that \u201call those children are going to be voters\u2026 and those voters are going to remember who stood with their dad and their mom.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Latin American Officials Advise Illegals with Criminal Records at Amnesty 'Coming-Out Party'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Latin American Officials Advise Illegals with Criminal Records at Amnesty 'Coming-Out Party'", "title": "Latin American Officials Advise Illegals with Criminal Records at Amnesty 'Coming-Out Party' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Immigration/ms-13-gangmember-AFP.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/12/15/officials-from-mexico-el-salvador-advise-some-illegals-with-criminal-records-at-amnesty-coming-out-party/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Latin American Officials Advise Illegals with Criminal Records at Amnesty 'Coming-Out Party'", "title": "Latin American Officials Advise Illegals with Criminal Records at Amnesty 'Coming-Out Party' - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Immigration/ms-13-gangmember-AFP.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Illegal Immigrants, Luis Gutierrez,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Luis Gutierrez", "published_time": "2014-12-15T12:08:00-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAt the largest amnesty workshop to date in Los Angeles, government officials from Mexico and El Salvador advised illegal immigrants, some of whom had criminal records, on President Barack Obama\u2019s executive amnesty program.\nThe majority of the country\u2019s illegal immigrants are from Mexico while the vast majority of illegal immigrants who were apprehended this summer arrived from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, one illegal immigrant woman asked whether she could qualify for Obama\u2019s executive amnesty if she had a DUI.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERVarious amnesty workshops have been held from coast to coast as amnesty advocates try to inform nearly five million illegal immigrants that they can receive Obama\u2019s executive amnesty.\nDescribed as a \u201ccoming-out party\u201d for nearly 5,000 illegal immigrants, \u201crepresentatives from the consulates of Mexico and El Salvador\u201d reportedly joined various pro-amnesty activists and organizations at the Los Angeles Convention Center for what will be a three-day immigrant rights event."}
