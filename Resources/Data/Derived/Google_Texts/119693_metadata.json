What that [means] is the Islamic State is building the institutions of the caliphate.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: \u2018We are in your streets\u2019: Chicago gets chilling Islamic State terror tweet\n\nOn Sunday Islamic State fighters seized a key military air base in northeastern Syria, capturing the last government outpost in a province controlled by the extremist army.\n\nThe jihadis launched their long-anticipated offensive last week to seize the sprawling Tabqa air field, located some 25 miles from the extremists\u2019 stronghold in the city of Raqqa, The Associated Press reported. The air base was one of the most significant government military facilities in the area, containing several warplane squadrons, helicopters, tanks, artillery and ammunition.\n\nThe Islamic State\u2019s grisly video of Mr. Foley\u2019s beheading last week, coupled with a series of social media threats to kill Americans, came after President Obama authorized a limited airstrike campaign to help Iraqi and Kurdish forces retake the Mosul Dam and protect the northern Iraqi city of Irbil.\n\nPHOTOS: Top 10 U.S. fighter jets\n\nBart Bechtel, a former CIA officer, said the Islamic State\u2019s day of horror starkly underlines its ultimate goal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just confirmation of what many of us have been saying for some time,\u201d Mr. Bechtel said. \u201cTheir determination to strike at the West \u2014 and, in particular, the U.S. \u2014 is in full display, yet there are too many whistling past the graveyard. One can certainly expect that all captives will be just as brutally killed and filmed.\u201d\n\nThe Islamic State, which also is known by the initials ISIS and ISIL, is thought to hold as many as 20 Westerners, including one American journalist and international aid workers.\n\nSteven Bucci, a former Pentagon official and analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said the beheading and threats have proved to be \u201ca wake-up call\u201d that poses risks to the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cI think what it tells us is, on one hand, they\u2019re very savvy, that they understand media and propaganda and shock value and intimidation probably to a higher degree than al-Qaeda did,\u201d he said. \u201cYou run the risk of not intimidating the other guy. You just wake up a sleeping giant. This was a very risky thing to do.\u201d\n\nKen Allard, a retired Army officer and military analyst, said the Foley execution, and any subsequent attacks on America, will galvanize the world against the Islamic extremists.\n\n\u201cThat beheading video seems like the one thing guaranteed to show the true nature of militant Islam, something that moderate Arabs, Egyptians, Israelis, Coptic Christians and U.S. soldiers have long understood,\u201d he said. \u201cIf IS carries out its threats to attack the American homeland, it may even accomplish what 9/11 did not.\u201d\n\nMr. Braniff said the Islamic State has settled on a strategy of violence against its immediate surroundings. Conversely, Osama bin Laden nearly always focused on selecting American targets \u2014 embassies, ships, New York and Washington.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve come into their own during and after the Arab Spring,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think they have a better read on the drivers of violence in the Muslim world currently than al-Qaeda senior leadership does.\n\n\u201cAl-Qaeda senior leadership banked on the ability of attacks against the far enemy, the United States, to be the drivers of resource mobilization. If they could successfully attack the United States, resources would flow in behind them,\u201d Mr. Braniff said.\n\n\u201cThe Islamic State, however, has understood that sectarian violence is currently driving resources, violent energy, money, men and weapons into the Middle East, into Iraq and Syria,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Islamic State rose from the ashes of al-Qaeda in Iraq, the terrorist group the U.S. largely defeated before Mr. Obama pulled all troops out of the country in December 2011.\n\nUnder the leadership of al-Baghdadi, a Muslim cleric from Samara whom the U.S. tried to kill on at least four occasions, the Islamic State took advantage of the civil war in Syria to build an army of 10,000 to 15,000 fighters. Many come from the West \u2014 Great Britain in particular.\n\nIn June, after waves of car bombings throughout Iraq, it invaded from Syria, took control of Mosul and spread south in a reign of terror that included beheadings and mass executions, as well as capturing oil-rich areas.\n\nThe Islamic State now operates in and around the Syrian town of Raqqa without interference. It is largely untouched in Iraq except for sporadic American airstrikes and a few Iraqi counterpunches.\n\nIts twin campaigns of murder and social media prompted Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to say last week:\n\n\u201cISIL is as sophisticated and well funded as any group that we have seen. They\u2019re beyond just a terrorist group. They marry ideology, a sophistication of strategic and tactical military prowess. They are tremendously well funded.\n\n\u201cOh, this is beyond anything that we\u2019ve seen. So we must prepare for everything. And the only way you do that is you take a cold, steely, hard look at it and get ready,\u201d Mr. Hagel said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Islamic State terrorist army's brutality and threats against America on Aug. 19 are signs it's focusing on entrenching its so-called Muslim caliphate \u2014 without interference.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Islamic State terrorist army\u2019s brutality and threats against America on Aug. 19 are signs it\u2019s focusing on entrenching its so-called Muslim caliphate \u2014 without interference.", "title": "Islamic State employs brutality, threats in effort to entrench caliphate without interference", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/aug/24/islamic-state-employs-brutality-threats-in-effort-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/24/8_242014_ap731536963798201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/08/24/8_242014_ap731536963798201.jpg", "description": "The Islamic State terrorist army's brutality and threats against America on Aug. 19 are signs it's focusing on entrenching its so-called Muslim caliphate \u2014 without interference.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Islamic State employs brutality, threats in effort to entrench calipha"}, "Author": "Rowan Scarborough", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Politics, Syria, Iraq, William Braniff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3924\"", "article_summary": "The Islamic State terrorist army\u2019s brutality and threats against America on Aug. 19 are signs it\u2019s focusing on entrenching its so-called Muslim caliphate \u2014 without interference.\nThe Islamic State now operates in and around the Syrian town of Raqqa without interference.\nPHOTOS: Top 10 U.S. fighter jetsBart Bechtel, a former CIA officer, said the Islamic State\u2019s day of horror starkly underlines its ultimate goal.\nWhat that [means] is the Islamic State is building the institutions of the caliphate.\u201dSEE ALSO: \u2018We are in your streets\u2019: Chicago gets chilling Islamic State terror tweetOn Sunday Islamic State fighters seized a key military air base in northeastern Syria, capturing the last government outpost in a province controlled by the extremist army.\nSteven Bucci, a former Pentagon official and analyst at the Heritage Foundation, said the beheading and threats have proved to be \u201ca wake-up call\u201d that poses risks to the Islamic State."}
