This is only a test.\n\nWhich of the following statements is false?\n\n1. America is just like \u201cNazi Germany.\u201d\n\n2. Joseph of the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat built the pyramids.\n\n3.Ben Carson applied to and was offered a full scholarship to West Point.\n\n4. Obamacare is the worst thing since slavery.\n\n5. Ben Carson is only running for president by popular demand.\n\n6. The media is easy on Hillary and tough on Ben.\n\n7. The Theory of Evolution is a bunch of fairy tales encouraged by Satan.\n\n8. Many Americans are dumb.\n\n9. Kid Carson wanted to attack his mother with a hammer and \u201cBob\u201d (or not Bob) with a knife.\n\n10. Ben Carson is the craziest person to ever run for president.\n\nIf you guessed True to 1-9, you are a through-and-through, tried-and-true believer that the guy who was nicknamed \u201cDummy\u201d in elementary school is actually brilliantly sane.\n\nBen Carson before he delivers the keynote speech at the Black Republican Caucus. (JOE SKIPPER/REUTERS)\n\nIf, however, you checked off only number 10 as true, than you are probably a pathetic, lying member of the mainstream media, and are definitely full of garbage.\n\nTherefore, as a bonafide member of the dwindling group of garbage grinders who still pathetically cling to that outdated, so-called freedom of speech thing, I figure, hell, why not use it while we still got it, to shine some light on Ben\u2019s boasts.\n\nThe Answers\n\n1. False. America is nothing like \u201cNazi Germany.\u201d Unlike the Nazis, we still have freedom of speech, which is why presidential candidates get to compare America to Nazi Germany.\n\n2. False. Joseph could not have built the pyramids, since they were built between 2589 and 2504 B.C. and biblical scholars date little Joe\u2019s birth anywhere from 2000 to 1200 B.C. Sure he lived to 110, but that still puts him 500 years too late by the best estimate.\n\n3. False. Hey, so waht that Carson never applied to West Point or that they don\u2019t even offer scholarships, since it\u2019s free. Carson\u2019s minions told Politico on Friday that if he had and they had he would have. Or something.\n\n4. False. The 700,000 enslaved sex workers today would definitely pick Obamacare over slavery.\n\n5. False. Carson\u2019s claim that running for POTUS isn\u2019t something he particularly wanted to do makes him KOBS: King of BS.\n\n6. False. Hillary\u2019s been asked the tough ones on Keystone, her vote on the Iraq invasion, her massive failure in Benghazi and her email scandal. Carson\u2019s confused asking with answering.\n\n7. False. Evolution is not the work of the Antichrist \u2014 unless Darwin transformed himself into a serpent. But then again if he had, that would also prove evolution. A conundrum to be sure.\n\n8. False. Americans aren\u2019t dumb \u2014 unless we elect a guy who says we\u2019re dumb.\n\n9. False. Carson did take a hammer to his mother and a knife to Bob, making him the only candidate in history who is furious at the media for questioning his rage.\n\n10. True. (See all of the above.)\n\nBonus Quiz: If you lie, is it: A) Your fault, B) The media\u2019s fault? or C) \u201cBob\u2019s\u201d fault?\n\nDocuments and photos detailing Greg Hardy's physical abuse of girlfriend Nicole Holder were recently revealed. (Christian Petersen/Getty Images)\n\nLEAGUE\u2019S FAILURE\n\nAnother spousal slam dunk by yet another NFL brute, followed by another NFL forgiveness fest.\n\nThat would be 278-pound, 6-foot-4, Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy, who beat his girlfriend, Nicole Holder.\n\nIn court documents obtained by Deadspin, Holder said Hardy had \u201ctossed her against a tiled wall, thrown her on a futon and choked her ...\u201d\n\nHardy was arrested and made to hand over his 10 shotguns and assault rifles.\n\nNicole Holder outside the Mecklenburg County Courthouse after Greg Hardy was found guilty of assaulting her and communicating threats. (ROBERT LAHSER/MCT /Landov)\n\nAfter his conviction, the NFL placed him on an exempt list. Good? Bad. He still collected his $770,000 weekly salary. Yes, that\u2019s weekly.\n\nRemember how, after the Ray Rice fianc\u00e9e-beatdown, the NFL said that they\u2019d trained a Critical Response team of \u201c200 specially trained league and club leaders\u201d to deal with abuse? Rice got fired, but\n\nHardy\u2019s boss, Jerry Jones, called him a \u201creal leader.\u201d The difference? Don\u2019t beat your girlfriend on video.\n\nFormer President George Bush Sr. rips former Vice President Dick Cheney in his new book. (Rick Barbero/AP)\n\nCROTCHY BUSH RIPS DICK\n\nYou\u2019ve heard of Iron Man, Iron Chef and even iron abs, but who knew that a guy with iron-rimmed specs who looks like he\u2019s never lifted iron could have an iron ass?\n\nThat\u2019s what former President George the First called President George the Second\u2019s second, Dick Cheney, in his new book, \u201cDestiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times reported that in the soon-to-be-released book, Bush told biographer Jon Meacham re: Iraq, \u201cI think he served the President badly.\u201d You think?\n\nBush Sr. said Cheney has an \u201ciron-ass view of everything.\u201d\n\nHe also minced no words about Junior\u2019s Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, calling the monster architect of the Iraq war \u201can arrogant fellow\u201d who \u201clacks humility.\u201d Really?\n\nRummy, now 83, responded arrogantly, \u201cBush 41 is getting up in years.\u201d That\u2019s the pot calling the kettle wack.\n\nWilliam \"Wobbles\" Soler (Michael Schwartz/for New York Daily News)\n\nJOE\u2019S \u2018SONG OF LOVE\u2019\n\nRep. Joseph Crowley \u2014 never one to back down from spontaneously breaking into song at political functions \u2014 will record a \u201cSong of Love\u201d in Forest Hills Monday. It\u2019s a love song for a sick kid as part of the\n\nnonprofit \u201cSong of Love Foundation\u201d that records personalized songs for kids with life-threatening illnesses.\n\nJoe\u2019s song, \u201cVictor Rugerio,\u201d was written by John Beltzer and Alex Forbes for Brooklyn kid Victor Rugerio, a cerebral palsy patient at Elmhurst Hospital Center. Way to go Joe \u2014 a human being in the midst of the congressional zoo.\n\nNOTHING 'RUNS' IN HIS FAM\n\nWobbles Soler, the 500-pound alleged gun runner, has one fan at least: His dad. The elder Soler said Wobbles is too sick to be \u201ccharged with all these bad crimes.\u201d He didn\u2019t say he didn\u2019t do the bad crimes just that he\u2019s too sick to be charged with them. It bothers him to see his son this way. No, not 500 pounds, just behind bars.\n\nModel Gisele Bundchen (Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images)\n\nEXPRESS LINES\n\nInflategate: Did supermodel Gisele get her boobs inflated because hubby Tom had his balls deflated? ...

It took 150 years to figure this out? ... Divorce judges: Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert broke up, and two weeks later Gwen Stefani and Gavin Rossdale broke up.
