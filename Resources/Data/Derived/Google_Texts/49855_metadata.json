But since then, it\u2019s risen sharply and now Indiana has the fourth highest rate of children aged four to 17 diagnosed and medicated for ADHD in the U.S. at nearly one in ten.\n\nIf you include children aged two to 17, Indiana\u2019s rank jumps to second in the nation.\n\nLiving With ADHD\n\nADHD is more than just a disorder for nine-year old Mark Evans. It\u2019s something he has to live with.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, he bounds off the school bus along with three of his brothers and runs up to his house. As soon as he gets inside, his mom Gloria tells him to get out his school folder so she can check how he did that day.\n\nIt actually got to the point where he was so angry at times that I thought he might burst.\u201d -Gloria Evans\n\nMark isn\u2019t having a good week so far. He lost behavior points at school both days this week. Today he lost points for talking to himself in class.\n\nDoctors diagnosed Mark with ADHD about three years ago. His mother said it did not seem to be a problem until he reached second grade.\n\n\u201cHe did preschool fine, he did kindergarten fine. I didn\u2019t get any calls from teachers or anything and first grade was actually ok because he had a brother that was three months apart so they were together,\u201d she says. \u201cThen the next year I started getting the phone calls that he wasn\u2019t focusing, getting kind of angry, not completing tasks.\u201d\n\nGloria was reluctant to put Mark on medication because she was afraid of the side effects, but then he started getting in fights with his brothers.\n\n\u201cIt actually got to the point where he was so angry at times that I thought he might burst. He balled up his little fists and get beet red,\u201d she says. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t handle his emotions.\u201d\n\nBut after putting him on medication, Gloria\u2019s fears were realized.\n\n\u201cHe would just lick his lips all the way around until they were black all the way around,\u201d she says. \u201cHis eyes would start to look funny. But I talked to the pediatrician. Instead of taking him off, we lowered the dose, that didn\u2019t work, we tried time release capsules to see if a little bit in the evening, a little bit in the morning would work. That would wear off before he came home from school.\u201d\n\nShe has now found a medication that works for him. He still gets some facial tics, but not as often.\n\nMark says the medication is better than getting in trouble at school.\n\n\u201cWe have this chart called point play and when I don\u2019t have my medication, I would get a lot of points off, but with my medication, I don\u2019t get as many points off,\u201d he explains.\n\nPossible Factors For High ADHD Diagnoses\n\nNationally, the number of people with ADHD diagnoses has jumped more than 3 percent since 2003.\n\nIndiana\u2019s rate has increased even faster-more than 6 percent in the same time period to almost 16 percent of children aged four to 17.\n\nIt is hard to say exactly what\u2019s causing Indiana\u2019s high rate\u2013few studies have looked specifically at Indiana and in an email, a spokesperson for the Family Social Services Administration, which oversees the division of mental health, said \u201cwe don\u2019t have any specific information on the issue.\u201d\n\nBut researchers at the Centers for Disease Control name three factors generally associated with states that have a higher percent of its population diagnosed with ADHD.\n\n1. Physician prevalence and demographics.\n\nCDC researchers say the more doctors you have the more likely children will be diagnosed, and the younger the doctors are.\n\n\u201cThat could be tied to better education about ADHD, what it is, what it isn\u2019t and more dedicated time in medical school, focusing on ADHD diagnosis because certainly the number of minutes spent on ADHD in medical school has been increasing,\u201d says CDC epidemiologist Susanna Visser.\n\nBut according to the American Association of Medical Colleges, Indiana has fewer physicians than other states and has a higher percentage of doctors over forty years old.\n\n2. Population on Medicaid.\n\nChildren in families that are on Medicaid often have the highest rate of ADHD diagnosis.\n\nAbout 17 percent of Indiana\u2019s population is on Medicaid. That is just above the national average of 16 percent, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n3. State policies.\n\nCDC researchers say states that high-stakes testing and lower funding for special education tend to have higher rates of ADHD.\n\nIndiana has raised the stakes for standardized testing several times since 1999 by linking school funding to performance. If students don\u2019t pass the third grade reading exam, the IREAD-3, they\u2019re held back until they pass the exam.\n\nAs far as special education is concerned, the state provides $24 million to schools. That\u2019s a drop from $30 million in 2003. To compare, Illinois spends more than $300 million each year for special education.\n\n\n\nThere are also complicating medical factors.\n\n\u201cChildren that are experiencing conflict or challenges in their home and have higher degrees of trauma also mimic symptoms of ADHD,\u201d says Jim Bush, the Director of Clinical Decision Support at Eskenazi Health Midtown Community Mental Health in Indianapolis.\n\nBush works with teachers and school administrators in two dozen schools to try get them to help students with ADHD. He says while it\u2019s important to find out what\u2019s causing Indiana\u2019s high rate of ADHD, it\u2019s also important to make accommodations for the children who are having difficulties in school.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen a young person is really doing their best to stay in a classroom what are their options? Are they able to stand up in the corner if they aren\u2019t being distracting. Are they able to do certain things at their desk to help them stay busy?\u201d he asks. \u201cCan they have a squishy ball in their hands to keep them busy? Schools are really pushed to hit these targets and these goals and funding is related to performance so they really need to make sure that the whole class is learning, so if it\u2019s disruptive it becomes challenging.\u201d\n\nGloria Evans agrees. It is challenging.\n\n\u201c[Mark is] expected to learn the same, listen the same, have planning skills the same,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s expected to have every skill that every other child has, and he doesn\u2019t. But unless he had his own classroom and special teachers, and then you come into the funds, and then it\u2019s a whole big bureaucracy of the funds just are not there.\u201d\n\nBack at his house, Mark is concentrating on his math homework.\n\nHe tries to concentrate \u2013 counting on his fingers when he can\u2019t do the multiplication in his head. But every once in a while, he can\u2019t help leaning over and asking his brother for help.\n\nGloria Evans says if his class had fewer students or was better able to respond to his individual needs, Mark would probably still need his medication but she thinks it would make a world of difference. For now, she says she\u2019s just doing what she can to give him the best opportunity later in life.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t do math, if you can\u2019t multiply, if you can sit down long enough to learn to do fractions and read, especially reading and writing and as we used to say arithmetic, if you can\u2019t do those three things and focus well enough to get the core of that, then you can\u2019t expect that child to go to college because they have tests you have to take to go to college,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was my biggest concern. That if I don\u2019t get him the help he needs right now, I would be hindering him in the future\u201d\n\nWhile more than 70 percent of children grow out of ADHD, a recent study in the journal Pediatrics warns that children who have ADHD and aren\u2019t treated properly have a higher mortality rate, are more likely to commit crimes and have more negative social interactions.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indiana ranks fourth highest in the nation for children ages four to 17 diagnosed with Attention Hyper Activity Disorder.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "Indiana ranks fourth highest in the nation for children ages four to 17 diagnosed with Attention Hyper Activity Disorder.", "title": "What Could Be Causing Indiana\u2019s High Rate Of ADHD Diagnosis | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/causing-indianas-high-rate-adhd-diagnosis-60067/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2013/12/CU-reading.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wfiunews", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2013/12/CU-reading.jpg", "description": "Indiana ranks fourth highest in the nation for children ages four to 17 diagnosed with Attention Hyper Activity Disorder.", "card": "summary", "title": "What Could Be Causing Indiana\u2019s High Rate Of ADHD Diagnosis"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe7e\"", "article_summary": "Just ten years ago, Indiana\u2019s rate of ADHD diagnosis was about the same as the rest of the nation.\nHe says while it\u2019s important to find out what\u2019s causing Indiana\u2019s high rate of ADHD, it\u2019s also important to make accommodations for the children who are having difficulties in school.\nAs more parents and doctors become aware of Attention Hyperactivity Disorder, the number of children diagnosed continues to rise, including in Indiana.\nIndiana\u2019s rate has increased even faster-more than 6 percent in the same time period to almost 16 percent of children aged four to 17.\nDoctors diagnosed Mark with ADHD about three years ago."}
