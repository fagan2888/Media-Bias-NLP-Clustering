Acuity Brands Continues Growth with ByteLight Buy

The buyer last picked up energy management company Distech Controls and wireless controls maker Adura Technologies

Electronics manufacturer Acuity Brands Inc. (NYSE: AYI) has acquired ByteLight Inc., a software provider for retailers.

The deal underscores how e-commerce continues to create M&A opportunities within the retail sector. Boston-based ByteLight provides LED integrated services that sync up with smartphones. The technology helps stores engage with customers and provide them with digital content, as well as indoor positioning, which alerts a phone's user to a particular product's location.

Acuity did not disclose terms for the deal. The Atlanta-based company announced that it paid for ByteLight's patent portfolio and intellectual property rights in cash, and that it plans to fold the company's services into its own LED segment.

Acuity has been actively acquiring other electronics brands in the middle market. In March, it bought Quebec-based Distech Controls, a maker of energy management and building controls, for approximately $252 million. In 2013, it purchased Adura Technologies Inc., a San Francisco-based developer of wireless controls and energy management services. It also spent $205 million on Sensor Switch, a Wallingford, Connecticut, company that makes motion-controlled sensors, in 2009.
