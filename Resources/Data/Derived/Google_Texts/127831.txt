Last November, the Writers Guild Association (WGA) announced the list of its “101 Funniest Screenplays” of all time. As a writer, I curiously scrolled through it. And while I scrolled, I began to notice something – there was only one screenplay listed about the experiences of people of color – “Coming to America.” While the list included three films staring a black performer — “Coming to America,” “Trading Places,” “Beverly Hills Cop” — they all starred the same black performer. And the funniest film named — “Annie Hall” — is one that few people of color have even seen, let alone would hail as the funniest ever written.

“Friday.” “I’m Gonna Git You Sucka.” “Harlem Nights.” “Boomerang.” “House Party.” “Up in Smoke.” None of these films made the cut on a list that includes highbrow humor and slapstick comedies alike. But “Airplane!,” “Caddyshack” and “The Hangover” made the cut.

Yet, the WGA was not alone.

Just two months prior, the Hollywood Reporter (THR) unveiled its list of “Hollywood’s 100 Favorite TV Shows.” THR’s list was about the same, listing only one show about the experience of people of color – “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” — and three shows prominently featuring actors of color (“Scandal,” “The Wire” and “Orange Is the New Black”). Yet these shows were buried down a list where the show that reigns supreme is … “Friends.”

One show out of 100 — of all time.

“Sanford & Son.” “Good Times.” “New York Undercover.” “Martin.” “Ugly Betty.” “227.” “Chappelle’s Show.” “Roc.” “Resurrection Blvd.” “In Living Color.” “What’s Happening?” “The Jeffersons.” I failed to understand the logic of how none of these shows made the list. And despite Bill Cosby’s current image, how could “The Cosby Show” not have been acknowledged in some way?

Not to be left out, the American Film Institute (AFI) proudly boasts its “100 Greatest American Movies of All Time” on its website. While films like “Forrest Gump,” “Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs” and “The Third Man” (which is ironically a British film) make the cut, great American films like “The Color Purple,” “Do the Right Thing” and “A Soldier’s Story” somehow do not. “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” squeaked in at No. 99 … so there’s that.

All of these lists got me thinking: How is it that films and television shows starring/about people of color are so rarely recognized as being good enough?

The lack of Oscar diversity over the last two years highlights the quantity-quality dilemma for diverse talent. That in order to increase the number of recognitions received, their works have to be deemed deserving enough to warrant that increase. So how can that be achieved in an industry with the quality standards represented above? Where, of 300 listed works, a mere six shows or films not solely about whites are deemed worthy enough to be considered among the best?

This reality demonstrates why, rather than focusing on the desired result —increasing the number of recognitions bestowed on diverse filmmakers — it may be more helpful to focus on the process of how filmmakers of color get such little recognition to begin with.

Hillary Clinton recently caused much debate when she said, “I don’t believe you change hearts…I believe you change laws.” What she said may not be popular, but it does accurately depict the harsh reality of racism. For example, if 75 percent of whites do not even know a single black person, and only 1 percent even have a black person in their lives that they would call a “close friend,” how likely is it that their hearts will be changed?

This highlights the challenge of empathy that works against people of color in the industry. People of color have long struggled to be recognized as being people. Because if others cannot empathize with you, they will not respect you, consider you or even simply see you.

Spike Lee eloquently addressed this in “Do the Right Thing” in a scene between his character, Mookie, and Mookie’s boss’s son Pino (John Tuturro):

Mookie: “Pino, who’s your favorite basketball player?” Pino: “Magic Johnson.” Mookie: “Movie star?” Pino: “Eddie Murphy.” Mookie: “Movie star? Prince. You’re a Prince fan…Pino, all you ever talk about is ‘n***a this and n***a that,’ and all your favorite people are so-called n***as.” Pino: “It’s different. Magic, Eddie, Prince…they’re not n***ers. I mean, they’re not black…I mean…let me explain myself. They’re not really black. I mean, they’re black, but they’re not really black. They’re more than black. It’s different.” Mookie: “It’s different?” Pino: “To me, it’s different.”

It’s this mentality that allows black biopics, for example, into award show conversations. Actors of color are rarely celebrated, nor do black films realize “crossover” box office success, unless the films focus on pop culture figures or subservient/victimized characters — films about entertainers, athletes, maids and non-rebellious slaves. In other words, films that are palatable to whites. Whites otherwise rarely watch character-driven films with, by or about black life. White people need a white conduit into each film.

It’s probable that “Training Day” would not have crossed over into awards territory if Denzel Washington’s co-star was not white. And it’s likely that “Monster’s Ball” would not have been widely regarded if its raw sex scene had been between two black actors rather than exploring the “taboo” of interracial sex. “The Blind Side” would likely never have been made if a black family had adopted Michael Oher rather than a white one, nor would “42” if it hadn’t also been turned into a story about Branch Rickey.

This Racial Empathy Gap is what black actors and filmmakers are up against every day. And it’s what Matt Damon failed to realize when he trumpeted that the “Project Greenlight” winner would be selected based on “merit.”
