He said the best advice is to avoid country roads at night and scan the horizon for any wild animal that can dash onto the road.\n\n\"If you see deer in a roadway you should come to a stop. Deer are unpredictable, if you've got your headlights on them, they can jump right on top of you,\" Collins said.\n\nThe Oklahoma Department of Wildlife says drivers need to be especially careful over the next month. Deer normally go out around sunrise or sunset, but for the next 30 days or so it's breeding season, which means they'll be out and about 24 hours a day.\n\nPeacock considers himself lucky and says the incident has changed the way he rides his bike.\n\n\"I definitely watch more than I did to begin with now. That was a pretty close brush with an accident,\" Peacock said.\n\nCollins recommends a helmet, gloves, leather pants and jacket, and boots that cover your ankles when riding a motorcycle.
