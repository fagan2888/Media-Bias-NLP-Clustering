For those who are not golfers, a \u201cmulligan\u201d is getting a second chance when a duffer hits a lousy tee shot. In this case, McConnell means Republicans want to tear up the Affordable Care Act and rewrite it in their own terms. But the Republican-controlled Congress will not have the power to achieve this, so it wants the Supreme Court\u2019s right-wingers to do the dirty work for them. Ad Policy\n\n\u201cWho may ultimately take it down is the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d McConnell told an audience of corporate CEOs assembled by Murdock\u2019s Wall Street Journal. In that event, McConnell explained, \u201cI would assume that you could have a mulligan here, a major do-over of the whole thing.\u201d\n\nHis cynical expectations seem to confirm the illegitimate power alliance elected Republicans have fashioned with the supposedly non-political Supreme Court justices. But McConnell tucked an awkward message in his comments\u2014an admission of his own weakness.\n\nForget his blustery campaign vows to destroy the ACA, which McConnell falsely characterized as an effort to \u201cEuropeanize\u201d American healthcare (too bad that\u2019s not the case). McConnell is belatedly conceding the GOP still won\u2019t have the votes to break Senate filibusters or to override Obama vetoes in House or Senate. Has Mighty Mitch begun to mellow?\n\nThroughout the Obama era, he starred as the belligerent Senator No, uncompromising and grimly effective. He and his party smeared Obama relentlessly, both the person and his policies, often with latent racial coding. But McConnell told the captains of industry the only hope for unraveling Obamacare depends upon Chief Justice John Roberts and the Right Wing Five.\n\nThe political landscape for 2015 is not about a nicer Mitch, but about the utter reversal of political priorities confronting the triumphant Republican party. To put it crudely, Mitch McConnell is like the dog who caught the bus he was chasing. What\u2019s he going to do with it? The reactionary factions in his backward-leaning party are eager for a grand ideological tear-down; but most folks are looking for shelter from the storm, not more chaos and upheaval.\n\nI suspect Mitch McConnell recognizes this. That\u2019s why he wants the Supreme Court to step up and take the blame for dismantling Obamacare. That\u2019s why he is suggesting small-ball legislative tactics\u2014unravel ACA one step at a time, repealing the medical devices tax or the thirty-hour-week coverage for small business workers or other unpopular provisions like the health-insurance tax and penalty. These issues might pose tough votes for Senate Democrats even if Obama intends to veto them.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mitch_mcconnell_mic_ap_img_0-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "William Greider", "description": "Congress will not have the power to overturn the Affordable Care Act, so Republicans are hoping the Supreme Court\u2019s right-wingers will do the dirty work for them.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "Congress will not have the power to overturn the Affordable Care Act, so Republicans are hoping the Supreme Court\u2019s right-wingers will do the dirty work for them.", "title": "Will the Supreme Court Help Mitch McConnell Destroy Obamacare?", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/will-supreme-court-help-mitch-mcconnell-destroy-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mitch_mcconnell_mic_ap_img_0.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 975}, "updated_time": "2015-06-29T07:52:30+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Congress will not have the power to overturn the Affordable Care Act, so Republicans are hoping the Supreme Court\u2019s right-wingers will do the dirty work for them.", "title": "Will the Supreme Court Help Mitch McConnell Destroy Obamacare?", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/will-supreme-court-help-mitch-mcconnell-destroy-obamacare/", "image": {"height": 975, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mitch_mcconnell_mic_ap_img_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mitch_mcconnell_mic_ap_img_0-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "December 8th, 2014", "sailthru.title": "Will the Supreme Court Help Mitch McConnell Destroy Obamacare?", "keywords": "Mitch McConnell, Supreme Court, Congress, Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, Public option, Single Payer, William Greider, The Nation", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 113515, "sailthru.tags": "Congress,Healthcare Policy,Supreme Court,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "The Nation", "published_time": "2014-12-08T19:46:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-29T07:52:30+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/"}, "sailthru.description": "Congress will not have the power to overturn the Affordable Care Act, so Republicans are hoping the Supreme Court\u2019s right-wingers will do the dirty work for them.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/mitch_mcconnell_mic_ap_img_0-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Mitch McConnell, the soon-to-be anointed Senate majority leader, wants a \u201cmulligan\u201d on Obamacare, and he\u2019s counting on the Supreme Court to give him one.\nTo put it crudely, Mitch McConnell is like the dog who caught the bus he was chasing.\nThat\u2019s why he wants the Supreme Court to step up and take the blame for dismantling Obamacare.\nAd Policy\u201cWho may ultimately take it down is the Supreme Court of the United States,\u201d McConnell told an audience of corporate CEOs assembled by Murdock\u2019s Wall Street Journal.\nI suspect Mitch McConnell recognizes this."}
