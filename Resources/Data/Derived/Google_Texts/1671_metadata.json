Those with a BMI of more than 30, or those with a BMI of 27 with obesity-related disease, such as diabetes, will be covered.\n\n\u201cBy helping them to lose weight, often times their diabetes, their hypotension improves, their osteoarthritis, their back pain,\u201d Kaplan said.\n\nCoverage is limited to treatment obtained from professional weight loss doctors or nurses and registered dieticians, but not necessarily to weight loss programs such as Jenny Craig and Weight Watchers. Supplements, pills and shakes are not covered, although some prescriptions are.\n\nWhile the coverage opens doors for people like Blumberg, there are concerns that it is also creating a financial opportunity for some unproven weight loss methods.\n\n\"There will be people that will offer quick fixes, that say, 'Look, I can help you lose weight in six months, three months, 30 days,'\" Maya Feller, a New York-based dietitian, told ABC News. \"It's just not sustainable.\"", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Affordable Care Act Will Cover Weight Loss Medical Services", "description": "Whether it\u2019s 10 pounds or ten times that amount, losing weight is a universal struggle, but some weight loss regimens are now covered under the Affordable Care Act.", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 ABC News Internet Ventures", "author": "ABC News", "og": {"site_name": "ABC News", "description": "Whether it\u2019s 10 pounds or ten times that amount, losing weight is a universal struggle, but some weight loss regimens are now covered under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Affordable Care Act Will Cover Weight Loss Medical Services", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/affordable-care-act-cover-weight-loss-medical-services/story?id=32317572", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Health/Gty_weight_scale_mm_150709_16x9_992.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Whether it\u2019s 10 pounds or ten times that amount, losing weight is a universal struggle, but some weight loss regimens are now covered under the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Affordable Care Act Will Cover Weight Loss Medical Services", "url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/affordable-care-act-cover-weight-loss-medical-services/story?id=32317572", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/story,32317572", "iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,32317572", "googleplay": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/affordable-care-act-cover-weight-loss-medical-services/story?id=32317572"}, "name": {"ipad": "ABC News", "iphone": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"ipad": 306934135, "iphone": 300255638, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}}, "site": "@ABC", "image": "http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/Health/Gty_weight_scale_mm_150709_4x3t_240.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "index, follow", "DC.date.issued": "2015-07-09", "al": {"ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/story,32317572", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for iPad"}, "web": {"url": "http://abcnews.go.com/Health/affordable-care-act-cover-weight-loss-medical-services/story?id=32317572"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Health/affordable-care-act-cover-weight-loss-medical-services/story?id=32317572", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/story,32317572", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}}, "Last-Modified": "2015-07-09 10:48:41", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939}, "keywords": "weight loss, regimens, affordable care act, health care, obese, skinny, fat, slim, overweight, bariatric surgery, gastric bypass, diet, exercise, health news, medical news, medical articles", "Date": "2015-07-09", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "weight loss, regimens, affordable care act, health care, obese, skinny, fat, slim, overweight, bariatric surgery, gastric bypass, diet, exercise"}, "article_summary": "Coverage is limited to treatment obtained from professional weight loss doctors or nurses and registered dieticians, but not necessarily to weight loss programs such as Jenny Craig and Weight Watchers.\nLosing weight is a universal struggle but now some weight loss efforts may not cost you as much money out of pocket.\nWeight loss programs that involve professional weight loss doctors or nurses and registered dieticians are now covered under the Affordable Care Act, legislation that expanded health coverage to millions of Americans and was upheld for a second time last month by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nDr. Michael Kaplan, who runs the Long Island Weight Loss Institute, said patients are now paying between 40 and 80 percent less for his services since insurance started covering them.\nWhile the coverage opens doors for people like Blumberg, there are concerns that it is also creating a financial opportunity for some unproven weight loss methods."}
