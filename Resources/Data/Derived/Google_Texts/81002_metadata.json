I don\u2019t know if it is something that is a flip of the switch,\u201d said New Jersey Department of Health Acting Commissioner Cathleen Bennett.\n\nThe acting commissioner told lawmakers the department has launched an aggressive, multi-pronged anti Zika virus campaign, including advising doctors to warn pregnant women, joining forces with other state agencies on mosquito prevention and detection and preparing a lab to test residents exposed to Zika while traveling.\n\n\u201cThe test will be sent to our public health lab right here in Trenton and we are expecting the testing is going to be available here in New Jersey in May,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nLawmakers\u2019 questions ran the gamut \u2014 on lead, tobacco, cancer research, opiate abuse, hospital acquisitions, reimbursement and charity care.\n\nTwo lawmakers exchanged words about whether all women in New Jersey have full access to health care.\n\n\u201cIt is unjust and unfair to sit here and say that there is women that have that full access,\u201d said Assemblywoman Eliana Pintor Marin.\n\n\u201cBut they did ultimately get the service that the needed?\u201d asked Assemblyman Declan O\u2019Scanlon.\n\n\u201cYes, after they came to out office though contacting my office,\u201d Marin said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad they got it. Then I can rest my case. That I have not yet found one person after reaching our offices couldn\u2019t find the services that they need,\u201d O\u2019Scanlon said.\n\nThe state health department says 700,000 uninsured New Jerseyans now have health coverage under the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion.\n\nDemocrats on the committee ask the acting health director of the Republican administration about the success of Obamacare or the ACA New Jersey and one did so by reminding the audience of what the governor has said about it.\n\n\u201cHe also said on March 18 2014 he refereed to Obamacare as a failed federal program. It seems to me it\u2019s been fairly positive at least for New Jersey,\u201d Schaer said.\n\n\u201cI would agree that the Medicaid expansion has been positive for New Jersey,\u201d Bennett said.\n\nThe acting commissioner also told lawmakers New Jersey has the fifth best sexually transmitted disease statistics in the country, prompting the chair to take note as he closed the hearing.\n\n\u201cI will admit to you as a result of today\u2019s discussion I finally have an extraordinary adept and meaningful response to why it is that people want to stay in New Jersey,\u201d Schaer said.\n\nFollow @HillNJTV", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "pubdate": 20160418, "og": {"site_name": "NJTV News", "description": "New Jersey Department of Health Acting Commissioner Cathleen Bennett spoke at the Assembly Budget Committee hearing, discussing a variety of topics, including action taken regarding the Zika virus, lead, tobacco, cancer research, opiate abuse, hospital acquisitions, reimbursement and charity care.
