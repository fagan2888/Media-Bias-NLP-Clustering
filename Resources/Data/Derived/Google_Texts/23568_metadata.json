That\u2019s when she received a letter seeking to increase that rent to $3,500 a month, far more than the retired shopkeeper says she can afford.\n\nThe spat is the latest involving the museum to cause a commotion in Little Italy, a neighborhood of former tenement buildings and narrow streets in Lower Manhattan that was once a bustling center of Italian immigrant life. An Italian restaurant that had been open for decades closed its doors last week in a separate rent-related dispute.\n\n\u201cThe negative press that this has caused is so detrimental to the spirit of the Italian immigrant,\u201d said Lou Di Palo, whose family has run an Italian specialty foods shop in Little Italy for over a century. \u201cI\u2019m upset over it.\u201d\n\nBut in recent decades, the character of Little Italy has been transformed by waves of gentrification and wealthy newcomers. The latest Census data from 2013 shows only 554 out of 7,816 residents, about 7 percent, in the Census tract encompassing Sarno\u2019s street identify as having Italian ancestry.\n\nMuseum president Joseph Scelsa told The New York Times that even after all Italian-Americans had gone from the area, \u201cthe legacy would still remain because we have an institution that does that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Little Italy museum seeks to evict Italian-American grandma", "title": "Little Italy museum seeks to evict Italian-American grandma", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Little Italy museum seeks to evict Italian-American grandma", "title": "Little Italy museum seeks to evict Italian-American grandma", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/05/little_italy_museum_seeks_to_evict_italian_american_grandma/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/little-italy-eviction.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Little Italy museum seeks to evict Italian-American grandma", "title": "Little Italy museum seeks to evict Italian-American grandma", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/little-italy-eviction.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Deepti Hajela", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9760\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m upset over it.\u201dBut in recent decades, the character of Little Italy has been transformed by waves of gentrification and wealthy newcomers.\n\u201cThis is my neighborhood.\u201dSarno said the fight over her $820-a-month, two-bedroom apartment above the Italian American Museum began about five years ago.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 A fight in Manhattan\u2019s Little Italy neighborhood between a landlord who wants a tenant out and a tenant who doesn\u2019t want to leave isn\u2019t your run-of-the-mill New York City real estate struggle.\nThat\u2019s because the landlord is a museum dedicated to the legacy of Italian-Americans, and the tenant is an 85-year-old Italian-American grandmother who has lived there for more than 50 years.\nThe spat is the latest involving the museum to cause a commotion in Little Italy, a neighborhood of former tenement buildings and narrow streets in Lower Manhattan that was once a bustling center of Italian immigrant life."}
