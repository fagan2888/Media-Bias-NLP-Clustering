The \"chip\" is no bigger than a grain of rice.\n\nLocal veterinary clinics and shelters scan animals upon intake with a special handheld device, according to ACS. The pet's microchip has a unique ID number that is similar to a driver\u2019s license number, which can be \"read\" by the scanner, helping trace the dog or cat back to the owner through their provided contact information, ACS said.\n\nPicture ID and proof of residency are required as ACS said free microchips are available for city of San Antonio residents only. ACS-implanted microchips include basic lifetime registration and are updatable at any time without charge.\n\nCopyright 2016 by KSAT - All rights reserved.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2016/03/12/pet%20dogs_1457832028840_2407203_ver1.0_160_90.jpg", "description": "Free microchips will be available to San Antonio pet owners during a clinic being held Sunday.", "og": {"site_name": "KSAT", "description": "Free microchips will be available to San Antonio pet owners during a clinic being held Sunday.", "title": "Free microchips available for San Antonio pet owners Sunday", "url": "http://www.ksat.com/pets/free-microchips-available-for-san-antonio-pet-owners-sunday", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2016/03/12/pet%20dogs_1457832028840_2407203_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Free microchips will be available to San Antonio pet owners during a clinic being held Sunday.", "title": "Free microchips available for San Antonio pet owners Sunday", "url": "http://www.ksat.com/pets/free-microchips-available-for-san-antonio-pet-owners-sunday", "image": {"width": 1280, "identifier": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2016/03/12/pet%20dogs_1457832028840_2407203_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "height": 720}, "site": "@ksatnews", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2016-03-13T01:20:52+0000", "sailthru.title": "Free microchips available for San Antonio pet owners Sunday", "sailthru.tags": "Animal Care Services,microchip,San Antonio,pets,Dignowity Hill Farmer's Market,Pets,News,Top Stories,Local,San Antonio", "fb": {"app_id": 362904920453016}, "google-site-verification": "saKN_Rxj3pYzy5TY3_Llko_4hA3OUGCoya0vO4STuSc", "keywords": "Animal Care Services,microchip,San Antonio,pets,Dignowity Hill Farmer's Market,Pets,News,Top Stories,Local,San Antonio", "article": {"section": "Pets", "tag": "san antonio, pets, animal care services, microchip, dignowity hill farmer's market", "published_time": "2016-03-13T01:20:52+0000", "modified_time": "2016-03-13T01:20:52+0000"}, "news_keywords": "News", "content_id": 259692525, "sailthru.description": "Free microchips will be available to San Antonio pet owners during a clinic being held Sunday.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://media.ksat.com/photo/2016/03/12/pet%20dogs_1457832028840_2407203_ver1.0_1280_720.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page-type": "article"}, "article_summary": "SAN ANTONIO - Free microchips will be available to San Antonio pet owners during a clinic being held Sunday.\nPicture ID and proof of residency are required as ACS said free microchips are available for city of San Antonio residents only.\nResidents who are interested in getting their pets sterilized will also have an opportunity to learn about free and low-cost services, ACS said.\nNo appointments are needed at ACS' Microchip MANIA events, but residents must ensure their animal companions are leashed or in an appropriate carrier, according to ACS.\nACS-implanted microchips include basic lifetime registration and are updatable at any time without charge."}
