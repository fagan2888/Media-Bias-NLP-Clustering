Few doctors tell patients about costs, partly because they don\u2019t know themselves; insurers have the last word. All health-care economists I know of\u2014whether or not they support the Affordable Care Act\u2014have supported more price transparency so that patients can make better decisions about procedures or tests of limited value, or better understand whether a doctor is ordering such things to reduce the chances of a malpractice lawsuit.\n\nNow comes Phillip Levine of the Brookings Institution to tell us that college prices work pretty much the same way. There is the sticker price and then there are actual prices, net of the best financial aid that students and their parents can negotiate.\n\nBut many students and families do not realize they can bargain. And when they do, they have little or no idea of what they realistically may gain.\n\nDoes this lack of transparency matter? Mr. Levine argues that it does, especially for students wanting to attend private, highly selective colleges. Given the high price of such schools\u2014which for many families can exceed the cost of buying a home if they don\u2019t receive financial assistance\u2014it simply defies common sense that prospective attendees don\u2019t have sufficient information to know whether they can afford a college before applying.\n\nMr. Levine suggests that federally required disclosures of the average net price, which are arranged by broad income category of an applicant\u2019s family, aren\u2019t helpful because averages can be heavily influenced by outliers in financial aid packages. Such aid may be determined on the basis of more than a family\u2019s income. He suggests that colleges instead use simplified financial calculators that account for the multiple factors schools use to determine aid\u2014of the kind that he developed for Wellesley College\u2014and that they publish net median prices by income category, since medians eliminate the effects of outliers.\n\nNow, if only health-care providers would do something similar.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Robert Litan summarizes recent research on the costs of college, discussing Phillip Levine's work on increasing transparency for students and their families.", "title": "A Clearer Approach to College Costs", "og": {"site_name": "The Brookings Institution", "description": "Robert Litan summarizes recent research on the costs of college, discussing Phillip Levine's work on increasing transparency for students and their families.", "title": "A Clearer Approach to College Costs", "url": "http://www.brookings.edu/research/opinions/2014/11/14-clearer-approach-to-college", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/images/c/ck%20co/college_graduation001/college_graduation001_16x9.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 360}, "locale": "en", "type": "article", "determiner": "auto"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 151106990, "title": "A Clearer Approach to College Costs", "image": {"width": 560, "identifier": "http://www.brookings.edu//~/media/research/images/c/ck%20co/college_graduation001/college_graduation001_16x9.jpg?w=560", "height": 315}, "site": {"identifier": "BrookingsInst", "id": 151106990}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Robert Litan summarizes recent research on the costs of college, discussing Phillip Levine's work on increasing transparency for students and their families."}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 137459917707}, "ces": {"broadcontenttype": "Commentary", "programs": "Economic Studies", "topics": "Education ; Economics ; U.S. Higher Education", "topicsbroad": "Education ; Economics", "experts": "Robert E.
