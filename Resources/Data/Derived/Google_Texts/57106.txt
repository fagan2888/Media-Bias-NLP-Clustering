UPPER DARBY >> The Upper Darby School District will be hiring an outside agency to file and comply with the 2015 Affordable Care Act and IRS reporting requirements.

Business Manager Ed Smith informed the board of the time consuming process to compile and file the information and recommended hiring ACA Track, of Commerce, Mich., for the job.

According to Smith, the cost to the district is $18,825.

A cost breaks down to: 90 cents per full-time employee (about 1,500), per month, totaling $16,200; and a one-time implementation fee of $750 to print and mail forms, totaling $1,875.

“The IRS reporting is a complicated and cumbersome process as there are multiple sources of information to be compiled,” Smith said listing Blue Cross and the District’s payroll system. “The presentation at the (Delaware County Intermediate Unit) had another vendor which was more expensive. The other company was Equifax with an annual cost of $15,000 to $25,000.”

District Manager of Benefits and Compliance Nina Tyre presented an overview of statistics, noting the district would generate about 1,500 1095C and 1094B forms for 2015 on all full-time employees, COBRA recipients and retirees on health plans.

Arthur J. Gallagher, the district’s insurance broker, compared presentations by two companies last month.

According to Tyre, ACA Track would manage all data integration each month, provide a detailed gap analysis of the missing data required for IRS reporting, provide single transmittal file for 1094C reporting to the IRS each year and provide a call center for employees questions.

The consensus of the finance and operations committee was to accept the recommendation of the business manager and officially approve outsourcing the mandated filings at the regular board meeting.
