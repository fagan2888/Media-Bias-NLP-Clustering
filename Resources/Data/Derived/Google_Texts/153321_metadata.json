It\u2019s a very special day,\u201d said Rosberg, who led throughout to become the first German to triumph at Hockenheim since Michael Schumacher won in 2006.\n\nHamilton, who crashed in qualifying and survived a number of scrapes throughout the race, could not pass Valtteri Bottas in the closing laps and the Finn took second to give Williams its 300th F1 podium finish.\n\n\u201cIt was not easy and required input from all the engineers. Thanks to all the fans. I saw many Finnish flags so thank you,\u201d Bottas said.\n\nHamilton was pushed back to the penultimate row of the grid due to his qualifying crash and a penalty for changing his gearbox, but threaded his way through the field despite a broken front wing caused by a collision with former teammate Jenson Button of McLaren.\n\nHis super-soft tires wore quickly in his final stint and he did not have the grip to get past Bottas. Rosberg leads Hamilton by 14 points going into next weekend\u2019s race in Hungary.\n\nFour-time defending champ Sebastian Vettel was fourth, ahead of Ferrari\u2019s Fernando Alonso who won his exciting battle with Red Bull\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo for fifth.\n\nAlonso and Force India\u2019s Nico Hulkenberg, who finished seventh, are the only drivers to have scored points in each of the ten races so far this season, and the Spaniard\u2019s points finish means Ferrari has finished in the points for 77 consecutive races.\n\nThere was a collision at the first corner between Kevin Magnussen\u2019s McLaren and Felipe Massa\u2019s Williams, which flipped over and slid across the run-off area in a shower of sparks.\n\nThe McLaren also left the track and Ricciardo had to steer wide around them to avoid the damage, dropping him down to 15th and compromising his race.\n\nMagnussen had to pit to repair damage to his left front tire but Massa\u2019s race was over. The Brazilian emerged unhurt from the car to cheers from the crowd.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay. The accident was a little bit more scary watching than being inside. I just saw everything the other way around, but I am fine,\u201d Massa said. \u201cI am so disappointed at what happened. It\u2019s another race and another car that has pushed me out and finished my race. With a car that that is very competitive and fast that\u2019s so disappointing.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "F1 championship leader Rosberg wins German GP", "title": "F1 championship leader Rosberg wins German GP", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "F1 championship leader Rosberg wins German GP", "title": "F1 championship leader Rosberg wins German GP", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/07/20/f1_championship_leader_rosberg_wins_german_gp/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/germany-f1-gp-auto-racing.jpeg11-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "F1 championship leader Rosberg wins German GP", "title": "F1 championship leader Rosberg wins German GP", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/07/germany-f1-gp-auto-racing.jpeg11-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Ciaran Fahey", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s a very special day,\u201d said Rosberg, who led throughout to become the first German to triumph at Hockenheim since Michael Schumacher won in 2006.\nIt\u2019s another race and another car that has pushed me out and finished my race.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsHOCKENHEIM, Germany (AP) \u2014 Nico Rosberg won the German Grand Prix on Sunday to stretch his lead in the Formula One drivers\u2019 championship over Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton, who finished third after starting 20th.\nRosberg leads Hamilton by 14 points going into next weekend\u2019s race in Hungary.\nHis super-soft tires wore quickly in his final stint and he did not have the grip to get past Bottas."}
