They get close, and he runs away. The game is afoot.\u201d\n\nThe first sighting was at 3:07 a.m. on the 1100 block of East Jamison Place, and several sightings were called in as the sun began to rise, Brooks said. The last time people saw the bear was at 6:15 a.m. near University Boulevard and Mineral Avenue, she said.\n\n\u201cThe bear has hunkered down somewhere,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nA reverse 911 call was made to 10,000 homes.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of people walking to school or going to work. We just wanted to let them know about the bear,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nDeputies and Colorado Parks and Wildlife rangers are trying to reach the bear for its own safety and for the public\u2019s safety.\n\nSo far, there have been no physical contacts reported between the bear and humans.\n\nWildlife officials say there have been an unusual number of black bear sightings in recent weeks because of a shortage of food for the animals in the mountains.\n\nBear sightings and chases have been a daily ongoing saga in the late summer of 2015.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Bear afoot in Centennial this morning, last seen running away from deputies, wildlife officials", "title": "Bear afoot in Centennial this morning, last seen running away from deputies, wildlife officials", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/02/bear-afoot-in-centennial-this-morning-last-seen-running-away-from-deputies-wildlife-officials/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-02T07:36:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-02T07:36:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Animals"}, "article_summary": "\u201cDeputies and wildlife officials have seen the bear multiple times,\u201d said Julie Brooks, spokeswoman for the Arapahoe County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nResidents in Centennial and Arapahoe County have been warned: there is yet another bear afoot in populated areas of the Denver metro area.\nBear sightings and chases have been a daily ongoing saga in the late summer of 2015.\nWildlife officials say there have been an unusual number of black bear sightings in recent weeks because of a shortage of food for the animals in the mountains.\nWe just wanted to let them know about the bear,\u201d Brooks said."}
