For example, the gray shingled entryway, which in the summer is festooned with lush greenery, needed only a few artistic flourishes before it ended up on the cover of her Cobblestone Way Calendar several years ago.\n\nThe calendar, now in its 28th year, is sold internationally, according to Jacobs, a petite woman whose vibrant Mexican-print blouse and skirt are as colorful and lively as her artwork. She and her husband, Bob Klein, have lived in Brooks for 18 years. They relocated to Maine from the West Coast in search of affordable land, sufficient rainfall for farming and a welcoming community. They have found those things in and around their off-the-grid home.\n\nBut the house and their lives have done a lot of evolving since they moved into the structure that originally was built by a group of back-to-the-landers.\n\n\u201cThe core of the house was here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt started out as \u2014 who knows? \u2014 a goat shed or something.\u201d\n\nWhen they first purchased the property, the kitchen was small, dark and cramped. The upstairs bedroom was tucked under a steeply pitched roof that compelled the 6-foot, 2-inch tall Klein to hunch over or risk bumping his head. Only propane lights illuminated the dark winter nights.\n\nThe couple made several changes that have added light, space and liveability. An addition gave them a new kitchen and expanded the upstairs living space. A big window in their bedroom means they have a wide view of the fields and forest below. A modified masonry wood stove is a focal point of their house, warming it in the wintertime, and solar-powered lights allow Jacobs to work by night \u2014 her preferred time to get things done \u2014 in her plant-filled home studio.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m most creative at night in the dark,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m creating my own world. I don\u2019t have all the distractions of wanting to be out in the garden.\u201d\n\nMost recently, Jacobs has spent her nights creating the bright world in the brand-new children\u2019s book \u201cPrincess Rosie\u2019s Rainbows\u201d and a retelling of the Brothers Grimm fairy tale about the six swans, which has yet to be published.\n\nBy day, at least during the growing season, she helps tend the large vegetable gardens that provide most of the produce she and Klein eat. The duo have planted a variety of fruit and nut trees on their property, too, including chestnuts, walnuts, northern pecans and hazelnuts.\n\nIn some ways, Zephyr Hill Farm is not unlike the carefully developed world of her art. It is peaceful, welcoming and a sanctuary for Jacobs and Klein.\n\n\u201cWe love it here,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "If artist Kim Jacobs\u2019 home at the end of a quiet road in the rural town of Brooks looks awfully familiar, there may be a good reason for that.
