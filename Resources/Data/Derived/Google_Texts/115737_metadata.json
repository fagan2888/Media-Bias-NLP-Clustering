The GOP-led House has voted 56 times to repeal or undermine the law, but zero times on a plan to replace it.\n\nOn Tuesday, the party\u2019s unsolved dilemma made its first big appearance in the 2016 Republican presidential race. First, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker released a plan that would replace the health-care law with a mix of tax benefits and deregulation, designed to make insurance more affordable but less government-controlled.\n\nThen, almost immediately, he was attacked by a fellow Republican candidate, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who said that Walker\u2019s supposedly conservative plan is actually terribly liberal.\n\nIn fact, Jindal said, Walker\u2019s plan is so bad that it might signal the death of conservatism itself. And also dishonor the Fourth of July.\n\n\u201cWhen did conservatism die?\u201d Jindal said in a written statement. He said that Walker\u2019s plan would make Americans more dependent on government spending, giving the lie to Walker\u2019s past praise for Independence Day. \u201cWith this Obamacare lite health care proposal, he\u2019s going to have to drop those lines from his speech.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act, signed into law in 2010, created a series of benefits to make obtaining insurance easier. It offers subsidies to help low-income people pay for coverage. New rules allow children to stay on their parents\u2019 plans until age 26 and prohibit insurers from denying coverage to people with expensive preexisting conditions.\n\nThis is one half of the GOP\u2019s dilemma: Those benefits, like most government benefits, would be difficult to take away. An estimated 19 million people could lose health insurance if the measure were repealed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost motherhood and apple pie now, that any plan should protect people with pre\u00adexisting conditions and help people without health insurance to buy it,\u201d said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for any candidate to walk away from those ideas.\u201d\n\nBut this is the other half of the dilemma: The Affordable Care Act remains unpopular among the primary voters Republicans care about. They particularly resent its regulations and bureaucracy, and the \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d which requires most people to obtain insurance or pay a fine.\n\nAll of the 17 major Republicans running for president have promised they would repeal the law. But most of them have said relatively little about what they\u2019d put in its place.\n\nFront-runner Donald Trump, for instance, has said that his replacement would be \u201csomething terrific\u201d and that it would involve making an unspecified deal with hospitals to treat the poor and uninsured.\n\n\u201cHow do you do that, though?\u201d CNN\u2019s Dana Bash asked him.\n\nTrump did not seem to know.\n\n\u201cWe are going to have to work out some kind of a very, very smart deal with hospitals,\u201d he said.\n\nThe three GOP candidates who have released the most detailed plans are Jindal, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and \u2014 on Tuesday \u2014 Walker.\n\nWalker\u2019s plan is 15 pages, but five of those pages contain only logos and three more pages are devoted to tearing apart the health-care law. The other material, the \u201creplace\u201d part of Walker\u2019s proposal, includes elements common to other Republican plans.\n\nIt would, for instance, allow people to buy health coverage from insurers outside their states. That is intended to allow greater competition, but critics say it could lead to a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d with insurers clustered in the state that regulates them the least.\n\n\u201cImagine if you could follow any state\u2019s gun-control regulations,\u201d said Katherine Hempstead, director of the coverage team at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.\n\nWalker also would punt some key issues to state governments.\n\nThe states could decide whether to require insurers to cover children on their parents\u2019 plans up to age 26. States could set up \u201chigh-risk pools,\u201d which are insurers of last resort, to cover those who can\u2019t get private insurance because of preexisting conditions.\n\nAnd the plan would offer tax credits to people who buy health insurance on their own, instead of through an employer. These credits \u2014 worth up to $3,000 per person per year, depending on age \u2014 would be a new way to accomplish one of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s old goals. Which is making insurance more affordable for consumers.\n\nWalker, speaking at Cass Screw Machine Products in Brooklyn Center, Minn., said he thinks that, if elected, he could get this done quickly.\n\n\u201cWe make sure this happens right away. Because, look, we\u2019ve got to repeal Obamacare entirely \u2014 lock, stock and barrel. And we\u2019ve got to repeal every part of it,\u201d Walker said.\n\nEven for a Republican president, however, \u201creplace\u201d would not come that easily. It might take months of haggling and compromise and bitterness to produce a solution, just as it did for Democrats when they had all the power.\n\nTuesday offered a preview: Jindal\u2019s fiery attack on Walker was based on a fairly wonky disagreement. Walker\u2019s sin was that his tax credits would be . . . refundable.\n\nMeaning that, under Walker\u2019s plan, someone who received a $3,000 tax credit \u2014 but owed only $2,000 in taxes \u2014 would get a $1,000 check from the government. Jindal prefers offering \u00adinsurance-buyers a tax deduction, which would lower tax bills but not promise anybody a check.\n\n\u201cHis plan is fundamentally accepting the premise of Obamacare \u2014 that we need a new federal entitlement program,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cSurely we as Republicans have more courage than this.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the distinction that killed conservatism and besmirched Independence Day. If Walker, or Jindal, becomes president, that\u2019s the fire that lies ahead.\n\nJohnson reported from Brooklyn Center.
