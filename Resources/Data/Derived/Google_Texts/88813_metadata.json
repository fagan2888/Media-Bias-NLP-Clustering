But sometimes, the gaffes are just too glaring, public and spectacular to overlook.\n\nSo as we bid goodbye to 2013, let\u2019s take a moment to reflect on the year that was\u2014and thank our lucky stars we weren\u2019t the orchestrators of these messy rollouts, launch failures and other wacky maneuvers.\n\nHere are my picks for the top 10 technology failures of 2013, in no particular order \u2026 well, except for the first, which gets my vote for biggest tech flop of the year.\n\nHealthcare.gov\n\nThe Affordable Care Act was already a lightning rod for criticism, and that was before the disaster called HealthCare.gov went online. Or rather, didn\u2019t. Mandating health insurance and then not giving the public a way to evaluate their options shows a stunning lack of foresight\u2014or at the very least, developer testing. That this disaster likely cost $170 million dollars simply defies logic.\n\nThe tech failure here mirrors the broken and fragmented nature of healthcare tech systems. It\u2019s basically what happens when government agencies and insurance companies, with their vast and incompatible databases, are suddenly called upon to make their systems talk to one another. And it doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that doing it on a tight deadline for a high-profile site, destined to get hammered by hundreds of thousands of people all at once, cranks the impossibility factor up quite a bit.\n\nHealthcare.gov has come a long way since October, but the site still reportedly has issues. By early December, it met administration goals of serving 800,000 unique users and 18,000 enrollment requests a day\u2014but glitches in the system have also caused roughly 15,000 applications to go astray, as insurers never saw them. There\u2019s little doubt that this debacle will be remembered as the biggest government tech failure of 2013.\n\nThe Facebook Phone Fail\n\nLike Carrie Underwood in the remade Sound of Music Live!, the HTC First smartphone started out as an intriguing concept that attempted to shoehorn something very popular (Facebook) into a familiar vehicle (a smartphone). And like that live television event, it wound up being an undeniable disaster.\n\nThe HTC First was the premiere handset launched with Facebook Home, an Android homescreen replacement and the social network\u2019s land grab for smartphone dominance. Had it succeeded, it would have proven that smartphone users wanted Facebook at the heart of their phones.\n\nIt also would have buoyed the company\u2019s faltering position in the competitive mobile industry. Instead, the phone wound up being an embarrassment to all companies involved.\n\nGoogle Kills Reader, Users Shed Blood Tears\n\nIn the era of Twitter and Facebook, the death of a RSS feed reader may seem barely shrug-worthy. Yet when Google killed off its Google Reader service in July, the decision incited a public outcry. People scrambled to find alternatives or posited their theories on what rang the death knell.\n\nIf there\u2019s a takeaway here, it might be what countless country songs have already taught us\u2014that you never really know what you\u2019ve got until it\u2019s gone. Or for something slightly less clich\u00e9d: Never forget that free Internet services like Google projects are ephemeral. Use them at will, but depend on them at your peril.\n\nGovernment Spies Like Us\n\nThe biggest leak in U.S. history gripped the world\u2019s attention last June, when a former government contractor revealed a massive U.S.-sanctioned global spying operation.\n\nEdward Snowden handed over several thousand National Security Agency documents to the Guardian and the Washington Post, which broke the story on the Internet and telephone surveillance programs. The revelation stunned readers, and the PRISM program in particular drew attention for forcing U.S.-based technology companies to comply with demands for user data.\n\nWhatever you think of Snowden, he\u2019ll be remembered for making everyday people think about information privacy in the technology age\u2014and whether it\u2019s a right, a privilege or simply make-believe.\n\nBlackBerry\n\nStruggling BlackBerry headed into the year desperate for a hit, and perhaps in an alternate universe, last January\u2019s launch of the new flagship BlackBerry 10-powered Z10 smartphone delivered it.\n\nNot so in this reality. Here, it was a painful billion-dollar punch to the gut. The company tried to sell itself, then changed its mind, driving stock values into the ground. That lead to the abrupt ouster of CEO Thorsten Heins and other ranking executives, amid wave upon wave of BlackBerry layoffs that affected thousands of workers.\n\nNow it\u2019s up to former Sybase chief John Chen to stabilize the company\u2019s finances and prove that the once-dominant mobile player still has some life in it. If he pulls it off, he\u2019ll be a miracle worker, because BlackBerry death watch.\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s Surface RT\n\nYes, new versions are now out that might still turn around the fortunes of Microsoft\u2019s troubled sorta-tablet, sorta-PC. But no successful project forces a company to take a nearly $1 billion write-off to cover unsold inventory.\n\nCustomers just didn\u2019t know what to make of the original Surface RT. It straddled the tablet-PC divide awkwardly, offering a keyboard cover, mouse support and an integrated stand that made it look like a laptop replacement. Yet it ran a stripped down version of the Windows 8 called Windows RT, which didn\u2019t support most older Windows applications. (Its sibling, the Surface Pro, ran full-fledged Windows 8 and was much more successful.)\n\nThe $499 price tag\u2014plus $130 for the keyboard cover\u2014made the RT fairly pricey, too. And on top of all that, it just didn\u2019t perform well.\n\nYou might think that Microsoft learned its lesson. Think again. The upgraded Surface RT, now dubbed the Surface 2, still uses Windows RT, and still appears to be just as confusing.\n\nSamsung\u2019s Follies, a.k.a. the Galaxy S4 Launch\n\nSomething\u2019s amiss when the last thing you notice at a press event for a new gadget is, well, the actual gadget. What was actually on display at Samsung\u2019s New York City press event for the Galaxy S4 was the company\u2019s bizarre idea of what it thinks appeals to its smartphone users.\n\nInstead of a showcase for its new flagship phone, Samsung served up lame sketches and offensive typecasting. CNET\u2019s Molly Wood called the spectacle \u201ctone-deaf and shockingly sexist.\u201d Corny jokes? Check. Hot girls? Check. Old, out-of-touch Asian man who can\u2019t speak English? Boozy single women leering at a gardener? Check and check.\n\nAfter the latter, the emcee added this cringeworthy nugget: \u201cWhile the women are cooling down, why don\u2019t you tell us about S Health?\u201d Worst. Segue. Ever. And in the end, it was all for a bloated mass of features that most people will never use. It may not have hit Samsung sales hard, but the fiasco certainly eroded the company\u2019s goodwill and leaves it more vulnerable to the next PR chuckhole it hits.\n\nYahoo Mail\u2019s Makeover, Then Failover\n\nLast October, Yahoo Mail users got a surprise when their trusty inboxes suddenly showed up looking like Gmail, and they were not happy. Tabs were tossed, the print button morphed into a menu item buried under the \u201cmore\u201d drop-down list and, most importantly, these changes came with a slew of technical bugs. Some people\u2019s emails disappeared, while others lamented the disappearance of tabs and inbox-sort functions.\n\nThe redesign sparked an intensely negative reaction. Tens of thousands of people descended on Yahoo user message boards to protest the changes. There\u2019s even a Change.org petition that\u2019s 40,000+ strong, demanding a reversal back to the old Yahoo Mail. It was a fairly colossal mistake since, as Slate noted, those affected were some of Yahoo\u2019s most loyal users. At least up to that point, they were.\n\niOS 7 Cripples Old iPhones, Nauseates Users\n\niOS 7 is certainly a triumph in many ways. It has a clean, fresh design (like it or not), and it offers users a host of useful features. But the new operating system also hobbled phones, particularly the iPhone 4 and 4S. When Apple says its software can run on the company\u2019s legacy handsets, many users tend to take it on its word.\n\nAnd so, many people did\u2014and they paid for it with lags, glitches and crashes. Compounding the issue was the fact that Apple blocked them from reverting back to iOS 6. In essence, they were stranded with devices that were barely usable.\n\nOf course, not even the newest iPhones guaranteed a blissful experience. The Internet was awash with complaints from users who said that iOS 7\u2019s swishy new parallax effect nauseated them, and articles detailing how to turn that off still remain extremely popular posts here on ReadWrite.\n\nYouTube Switches To Google+ Comments, Trolls Revolt\n\nComment sections on YouTube are unquestionably a wild place, home to empathy, support, misogyny and prejudice in roughly equal measure. At least they used to be before the site\u2019s overlords at Google yanked the old comments system and replaced it with Google+ in September. Denizens of YouTubia hated the change. (Among them was YouTube co-founder Jawed Karim, who supposedly asked, \u201cWhy the f*** do i need a Google+ account to comment on a video?\u201d)\n\nThe site\u2019s video pages now rank messages based on viewers\u2019 social connections and buries unwelcome feedback. And if you\u2019re not already a Google+ user, you\u2019re now forced to join a new social network just to share that insightful take on what that fox says or theories on how an aging action star can stay so Van Damme flexible.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear\u2014while Google may indeed have wanted to bring more civility and quality to comments, the move was also a big membership push for its social network. And the latter motivation may ultimately prove more successful than the former, as it turns out that the new system attracts new types of spammers.
