Bob Woodward sat down with Howard Kurtz on Sunday, and suggested that the White House blames him for creating the media narrative that President Obama has been a weak leader.

Woodward compared Obama to the country's CEO, and said that "he has to find a way to work his will." Kurtz asked him about people within the White House who are "not happy" with Woodward's reporting.

"They said I started it," Woodward said. "This idea of he's gotta lead, and [Obama's] too passive at times on these budget issues."

"As you know, no one likes to be criticized and called out," he continued. "They deal with reporters... I think the temperature's going up right now as thereâ€™s more and more criticism on the president's comments on Obamacare."

Woodward has clashed with the Obama administration before: last year, he had a spat with the White House over an email exchange with economic adviser Gene Sperling, which he had suggested were heavy-handed. On the issue of the government shutdown, Woodward accused Republicans of "blackmail" over Obamacare, but was also critical of the president's dealings with the GOP.
