In December of that year, when I leveled the charge in response to the president\u2019s knowing mischaracterization of the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s scoring of his signature piece of legislation, I was called \u201cflagrantly dishonest\u201d by none other than the (rightly respected) civil liberties blogger/reporter Glenn Greenwald.\n\nAs recently as November 2012 \u2014 more than two years after the administration published grandfathering regulations as part of its health care legislation, rendering ludicrous the president\u2019s frequently repeated pledge that \u201cif you like your health plan you can keep it\u201d \u2014 much of the liberal commentariat was calling the electoral contest between Obama and Republican Mitt Romney a referendum on political honesty. The only way for truth to prevail, they argued, was to vote for the Democrat.\n\nBy this time, even the president\u2019s defenders were categorizing Obama\u2019s falsehood as, at best, \u201ca \u2018noble lie\u2019 in the Platonic sense of the term\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWe may find out whether a \u2018post truth\u2019 candidate can be elected president,\u201d Washington Post Plum Line blogger Greg Sargent warned just before the election. \u201cIf there is one constant to this campaign, it\u2019s that Romney has startled many observers by operating from the basic premise that there is literally no set of boundaries he needs to follow when it comes to the veracity of his assertions.\u201d\n\nOne year later, as the mainstream press was filling up with blow-by-blow accounts of Obamacare\u2019s brutally inept rollout and extravagantly broken promises, once-proud truth tellers like Sargent found themselves in the unintentionally comical position of downplaying the president\u2019s mendacity. \u201cThe White House could have been clearer in laying the groundwork for this political argument: It wasn\u2019t sufficient to say people who like their plans will be able to keep it, which is narrowly untrue,\u201d Sargent wrote. Then he pivoted to the real culprits, declaring that \u201cthe GOP outrage about Americans supposedly \u2018losing\u2019 coverage is largely just more of the same old misdirection. It\u2019s a subset of a larger Republican refusal to have an actual debate about the law\u2019s trade-offs \u2014 one in which the law\u2019s benefits for millions of Americans are also reckoned with in a serious way.\u201d\n\nSuch euphemistic apologia and subject changing was common in October and November, as insurance cancellation letters flew into mailboxes by the hundreds of thousands. New York Times editorialist David Firestone, in a piece with the sneering headline \u201cThe Uproar Over Insurance \u2018Cancellation\u2019 Notices,\u201d referred to Obama\u2019s lie as \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s unfortunate blanket statement.\u201d The paper\u2019s editorial board averred that Obama \u201cclearly misspoke,\u201d then claimed the canceled policies were \u201cnot worth keeping.\u201d House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) told reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t think the message was wrong. I think the message was accurate. It was not precise enough.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 30, the president himself attempted to shift the blame onto \u201cbad-apple insurers,\u201d and he suggested that the cancellations of what his administration was calling \u201cjunk\u201d plans were affecting \u201cfewer than 5% of Americans.\u201d The day before, top presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett tweeted, \u201cFACT: Nothing in #Obamacare forces people out of their health plans. No change is required unless insurance companies change existing plans.\u201d\n\nAs late as Nov. 4, two days after The Wall Street Journal published a devastating account of how White House advisers had internally debated softening Obama\u2019s absolute claim about being able to keep your health plan and doctor, the president was trying to wriggle off the hook by rewriting his own rhetorical history: \u201cNow, if you had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn\u2019t changed since the law passed.\u201d Italics mine, to emphasize the lie about the lie.\n\nBy this time, even the president\u2019s defenders were categorizing Obama\u2019s falsehood as, at best, \u201ca \u2018noble lie\u2019 in the Platonic sense of the term,\u201d as Salon\u2019s Brian Beutler put it on Nov. 7. But even at that late date, \u201cthe real lying liars\u201d (in Beutler\u2019s phrasing) were, of course, on the other side: \u201cNoble lies have in many ways defined the debate over the Affordable Care Act, but the vast majority of them have been lies conservatives told in a failed effort to nix reform.\u201d\n\nAll that pettifoggery was rendered moot on the evening of Nov. 7, when the president kinda-sorta apologized for misleading the country. NBC interviewer Chuck Todd asked Obama \u201cDo you feel like you owe these folks an apology for misleading them?\u201d The president, with much hemming and hawing within the ellipses, said this: \u201cI regret very much that\u2026 we weren\u2019t as clear as we needed to be in terms of the changes that were taking place\u2026 Even though it\u2019s a small percentage of folks who may be disadvantaged, you know, it means a lot to them. And it\u2019s scary to them. And I am sorry that they, you know, are finding themselves in this situation, based on assurances they got from me.\u201d\n\nAs Reason\u2019s Peter Suderman pointed out at the time, the apology itself was not technically accurate. \u201cPeople aren\u2019t \u2018finding themselves\u2019 in \u2018this situation\u2019 \u2014 the situation of having insurance plans they liked canceled \u2014 because of Obama\u2019s \u2018assurances,\u201d Suderman wrote at reason.com. \u201cThey are finding themselves in that situation because of legislation that his party crafted, rules his administration drafted, and a bill that he promoted vigorously and then signed into law. His assurances misled people about what would happen under that law, but did not cause the plans to be terminated.\u201d\n\nA lie this ignoble should stain the credibility of everyone who perpetuated it.\n\nThe estimated scores of millions of eventual health plan cancellations that Americans will soon face are not some weird unintended consequence of Obamacare. They are fundamental to making the law work as written. The Affordable Care Act relies on previously uninsured young people to overpay for coverage they don\u2019t need, and for previously insured adults to pay for health contingencies they will never face, be it childbirth for men or pediatric dental care for grandparents. That is what is supposed to allow more people to be covered and to keep overall rates in check. Since making people\u2019s health insurance more expensive is not particularly popular, Obama lied about it, and not only when he claimed you could keep your plan and your doctor.\n\nIn fact, the president promised at least 15 times while running for president in 2008 that his health insurance reform would reduce premiums by an average of $2,500 per family. In May 2009, he said the law would \u201cend up saving $2 trillion,\u201d leading to \u201clower premiums.\u201d The White House blog in November 2009 featured such headlines as \u201cObjective Analysis Shows Reform Will Help Small Businesses, Lower Premiums for American Families\u201d and \u201cCBO Confirms That Families Will Save Money Under Health Reform.\u201d\n\nAs Suderman wrote in June 2013, there was \u201cno mistaking the message that the Obama White House was selling to anyone who would listen: that premiums would go down, that benefits would go up, and that if premiums did happen to go up, it would only be as a result of an individual choice to buy more robust coverage.\u201d What\u2019s more, \u201cThis is the debate that even those relatively few Americans who follow wonky policy pundits were hearing \u2014 not one that emphasized trade-offs, but one that repeatedly emphasized that Obamacare would have mostly positive impacts on premiums, and that any negative impacts would be modest.\u201d\n\nFor years, liberal commentators have accused conservatives of living in an intellectual \u201cbubble\u201d of their own creation, impervious to reality. But through official intent and intellectual laziness, Democrats have created a bubble of deception surrounding Obamacare that will affect millions of Americans for years to come. A lie this ignoble should stain the credibility of everyone who perpetuated it.\n\nMatt Welch\n\nfor The Daily Reckoning\n\nEd. Note: Like it or not, Obamacare is a law. It is going into effect.
