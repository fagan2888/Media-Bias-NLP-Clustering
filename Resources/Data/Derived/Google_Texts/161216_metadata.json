And with the red-hot San Francisco Giants pasting the Minnesota Twins 8-1 Sunday, the Rockies are now five games out in the National League West.\n\nMorales, clearly the weakest link in the Rockies\u2019 rotation, gave up three homers, once again stoking questions about how much longer the Rockies can afford to send him to the mound every fifth game. He\u2019s served up 11 homers already, second-most in the National League behind Milwaukee\u2019s Marco Estrada.\n\n\u201cThey got me,\u201d Morales said. \u201cI tried to attack the hitters on both sides today, but sometimes I missed my spot and I got hit.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Atlanta Braves 7, Colorado Rockies 0 \u2013 May 25, 2014\n\nAs manager Walt Weiss pointed out, the Braves are quick to punish mistakes.\n\n\u201cYeah, he left some (pitches) up,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cThis Atlanta club puts balls in the seats. That\u2019s what they do, that\u2019s what they did last year. A couple of balls got elevated and they hit them out.\u201d\n\nWith plenty of pitching prospects in the pipeline, led by right-hander Eddie Butler at Double-A Tulsa, Morales\u2019 status is shakier than ever. Butler threw seven scoreless innings Sunday as Tulsa defeated Midland (Texas), 2-1. He scattered five hits and didn\u2019t allow a runner to advance past second base. Butler hasn\u2019t allowed an earned run in 22 innings.\n\nWhen asked last week if Butler was major-league ready, Weiss said: \u201cIf he\u2019s not, then he\u2019s real close. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of development left. It\u2019s just the experience of being here. That\u2019s obviously what he lacks. But as far as developing a pitch or more command, I think the development is behind him.\u201d\n\nThe Braves\u2019 Gattis blasted two homers off Morales, a solo shot to center in the second, followed by a two-run rocket to left in the fourth. It was the latter home run, coming on a fat slider, that elicited emotion from Morales. Weiss gave him the hook with one out in the fifth after Justin Upton\u2019s two-run homer to left. Morales fell to 3-4 and his 5.65 ERA is the highest on Colorado\u2019s staff, as are his 24 walks.\n\nTeheran, on the other hand, is the picture of poise and control. He allowed four hits, struck out seven and walked only one. Of his 93 pitches, 70 found the strike zone and he made Rockies batters look helpless. Nothing new there: In his last three starts against the Rockies, he\u2019s 3-0 with a 1.00 ERA.\n\nWhy does he own Colorado?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know no, help me out \u2026 go ask him. I know I haven\u2019t had any success off him,\u201d said Troy Tulowitzki, the National League batting leader who went 0-for-2 with a walk and a strikeout against Teheran and is now 0-for-7 with four strikeouts in his career against him.\n\nOn a perfect Georgia evening, the Rockies needed to strike early. But they wasted their best chances \u2014 no, make that their only chances \u2014 in the first two innings. Charlie Blackmon and Michael Cuddyer opened the game with back-to-back singles but were stranded.\n\nThe table was set again in the second, with Charlie Culberson reaching on a single and DJ LeMahieu on an error. But Teheran worked out of it.\n\n\u201cAfter that Teheran settled in,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHe throws a lot of strikes and has some deception. He commands all of his pitches and throws them for strikes.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Braves hit three homers off Franklin Morales, shut out Rockies", "title": "Braves hit three homers off Franklin Morales, shut out Rockies", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/25/braves-hit-three-homers-off-franklin-morales-shut-out-rockies/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140525__Franklin-Moralesp1.jpg", "height": 471}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140525__Franklin-Moralesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-25T18:11:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:22:28+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Nothing new there: In his last three starts against the Rockies, he\u2019s 3-0 with a 1.00 ERA.\nWhile Morales struggled in Colorado\u2019s 7-0 loss in the rubber game of the three-game series, Braves right-hander Julio Teheran pitched a scoreless, six-inning gem, continuing his mastery of the Rockies.\nWhen asked last week if Butler was major-league ready, Weiss said: \u201cIf he\u2019s not, then he\u2019s real close.\nMorales, clearly the weakest link in the Rockies\u2019 rotation, gave up three homers, once again stoking questions about how much longer the Rockies can afford to send him to the mound every fifth game.\nATLANTA \u2014 Before Evan Gattis\u2019 two-run homer ever reached the seats, Franklin Morales pounded his glove, looked to the heavens and let loose a screech of frustration."}
