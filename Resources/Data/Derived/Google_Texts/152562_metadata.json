But refinancing \u2014 for the right reason, with a good rate and a suitable term - can be a big saver in the long run.\n\nHow Uber knows your phone battery is dying and more\n\nWhy Congress is looking at labels to curb food waste\n\nSmoke detected on EgyptAir Flight 804: What does that mean?\n\nYou made it through the hardest part: buying a home. Now, perhaps just a few years later, you\u2019re ready to refinance your mortgage. How hard can it be? You may be surprised to find that it\u2019s not a couple-of-emails and a-phone-call-or-two process. In fact, there may be more paperwork involved this time around than when you first bought, especially if you went through the mortgage process in the \u201clow-doc\u201d days.\n\nLet\u2019s consider some important initial steps of a mortgage refinance \u2014 and then run through the process step by step.\n\nThe first step: Your mortgage refinance strategy\n\nBefore you begin, it\u2019s important to consider why you want to refinance your home loan in the first place. That guides the process from the very beginning.\n\nRecommended: Who owns Gatorade: Coke or Pepsi?

And it\u2019s tempting to refinance with another full 30-year term to really knock down that monthly payment. But that means you\u2019ll end up taking even longer to pay off your house and paying more interest. You\u2019ll want to take into account how much interest you\u2019ve already paid on your old loan and how much you\u2019ll pay with the refinance.\n\nLoans are front-loaded with interest, so the longer you\u2019ve been paying, the more each payment is going toward paying off the principal balance. By resisting the urge to extend your loan term (or, better yet, reducing it) and getting a lower interest rate, you can significantly reduce the amount of interest you pay over the life of the loan.\n\nChoosing a suitable loan term for your mortgage refinance is a balancing act between an affordable monthly payment and reducing your borrowing costs.\n\nUse a mortgage refinance calculator\n\nOnce you know you have a good reason and you\u2019ve determined it\u2019s the right time to refinance, it\u2019s time to work the numbers. Using a refinance calculator, like the one found on Zillow, can help you shop for the best mortgage.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to know (or make some educated guesses about) the fees you\u2019ll pay, your new interest rate and your new loan amount. There is even an option to roll the fees into the new loan under the \u201cadvanced\u201d options of the tool.\n\nOnce you input the data, the tool will calculate your monthly savings, new payment, lifetime savings and the number of months until you break even, considering the costs of your refinance.\n\nWorking with a refinance calculator will give you a good idea of what to expect. Even better, when you have a few estimates from mortgage lenders you can use the calculator to help determine who offers the best deal.\n\nIt\u2019s also key to shop the best refinance rates\n\nNow it\u2019s time for a little legwork \u2014 or more likely Web work and phone calls. You want to shop for your best mortgage refinance rate and get a loan estimate from each lender. Each potential lender is required to issue the estimate within three days of receiving your basic information.\n\nThe estimate is a pretty simple three-page document that details the loan terms, projected payments, estimated closing costs and other fees.\n\nCompare the loan details from each lender and decide which one is best for you. This is a good time to really work that mortgage refinance calculator we just talked about.\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s refinance program\n\nAnd while you\u2019re shopping lenders, you may want to consider whether a government-sponsored mortgage program can be a part of your refinance solution. President Obama and Congress established the federal Home Affordable Refinance Program in 2009 to help revitalize a housing industry crushed by the financial crisis.\n\nHARP \u2014 originally called the Making Home Affordable program \u2014 allows homeowners to refinance their mortgage no matter how little equity they have in their home. There are some restrictions: Homeowners must have conventional mortgages (loans owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac) and they need to be current on their payments.\n\nYou can determine if your mortgage is held by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac by checking here and here.\n\nThe Federal Housing Finance Agency estimates more than 429,000 borrowers nationwide remain eligible for a HARP refinance. More than 3.3 million borrowers have already refinanced their homes through the program, which has been extended several times but will expire on Dec. 31, 2016.\n\nRefinancing your home loan, step by step\n\nReady to tackle the whole refinance process? Go!\n\nDetermine your goal. We\u2019ve covered this: Refinance for the right reason. Aim to shorten \u2014 or at least maintain \u2014 your current loan term while lowering your interest rate.\n\nLearn your current credit score. Check your credit history and get your credit score. The better your score, the better the mortgage refinance interest rates you\u2019ll be offered.\n\nResearch your home\u2019s current value. Check your neighborhood for sales of recent homes like yours. Look up your home\u2019s Zestimate on Zillow and other online home value sources.\n\nShop for your best mortgage rate. But do all searching within atwo-week period so you don\u2019t cause your credit score to dip a bit.\n\nKnow your all-in costs. A home loan refinance can trigger a bunch of fees: application fees, the cost of an appraisal, origination fees, a document processing fee, an underwriting fee, a credit report charge, title research and insurance, recording fees, tax transfer fees and points, to name several. But remember, you\u2019ll get a clear estimate of mortgage loan fees from each lender you consider. And don\u2019t jump blindly for a \u201cno-cost refinance\u201d pitch. That means the lender is moving the upfront fees to your ongoing costs for the loan, in the form of a higher interest rate.\n\nGather paperwork. This can be a bit harder these days because so many of us do our financial business online. But you\u2019ll have to gather, print or download statements, pay stubs, and whatever else the lender will need during the loan process.\n\nLock your rate. You\u2019ll have to decide whether or not, and when, to lock your mortgage refinance rate. For the logically minded, it\u2019s a hand-wringer \u2014 more art than science.\n\nHave cash on hand. There are likely to be property taxes and insurance, closing costs and other expenses to pay at closing, so be sure to set aside enough to cover them. Again, it\u2019s listed in your loan estimate, so there should be no surprises.\n\nA final tip\n\nRemember to consider how long it will take for you to recoup the fees and expenses of a refinance. That was one of the outputs from the mortgage calculator we mentioned (the \u201cbreak even\u201d estimate).\n\nBut refinancing \u2014 for the right reason, with a good rate and a suitable term \u2014 can enhance your financial position.\n\nHal Bundrick is a staff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.
