Then we have nine fish dive reefs that are in 55 to 60 feet of water, those are spaced about two to three miles apart all at major public accesses,\" said McAlexander.\n\nSWARA Hopes to deploy the first artificial reef sometime this fall or winter.\n\n\"By creating something where people can access it readily from our beaches and they will see what is down there, they will see coral, they will see fish, as oppose to just white sand,\" said McAlexander.\n\n\"A living habitat for small fish and it will create a much larger ecosystem right off of our beaches that are pretty much barren,\" said Richard.\n\nMcAlexander says the strong support from the community will keep this project going for generations to come.\n\n\"When you see what is out there, what we are creating and what we are bringing to the community, I think it is a win for everyone,\" stated McAlexander.\n\nTo learn more about SWARA you can visit their website, and Facebook page.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SouthWaltonArtificialReefAssociation\n\nhttp://waltonreefs.org/", "article_metadata": {"description": "Creating living reefs for generations, that's the goal for the South Walton Artificial Reef Association.
