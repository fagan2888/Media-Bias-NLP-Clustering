A former University of North Texas exchange student from France was among the victims of the terror attacks Friday in Paris, the university said.

François Xavier Prévost, who attended UNT in fall 2007, was killed at the Bataclan theater where the American band Eagles of Death Metal was playing a sold-out show, university spokeswoman Margarita Venegas said.

UNT-International, which provides assistance to international students, learned of Prévost’s death Saturday evening.

“Our condolences go to his friends and family, and to all victims of terrorism everywhere,” UNT-International said in a Facebook post.

No current UNT students are studying in Paris this semester.

Meanwhile, Twitter users who knew him flocked to social media to remember Prévost.

Even UNT was affected by the Paris Shooting, our hearts go out to François Xavier Prévost family and friends https://t.co/70ctEEzkYW — Eric Mercado (@thatErcsme) November 15, 2015
