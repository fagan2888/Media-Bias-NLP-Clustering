No, he wasn\u2019t a gentle giant. He was committing a robbery, and he pushed that guy. He was acting like a thug, not like a gentle giant. He certainly didn\u2019t deserve to be shot for it.\u201d\n\nThe HBO host lamented that so many people involved in the social unrest in Ferguson were so quick to take a side.\n\n\u201cYou know what else I find disturbing is that everybody in America just sides with their own people and doesn\u2019t look at the facts,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cops, I saw on the news a couple of weeks ago, were wearing bracelets or something that said, \u2018I am Darren Wilson.\u2019 Why do you want to throw your lot in with this plain murderer?\u201d\n\nA grand jury is expected to decide next month whether to charge Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for the Aug. 9 fatal shooting of 18-year-old Brown. Missouri police have been brushing up on constitutional rights and stocking up on riot gear to prepare for riots that are expected if Officer Wilson is not indicted.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Late night comedian Bill Maher argued Friday that Michael Brown wasn't the \"gentle giant\" his sympathizers made him out to be and that demonstrators on both sides of the issue in Ferguson, Missouri, are reacting emotionally without getting all their facts straight.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Late night comedian Bill Maher argued Friday that Michael Brown wasn\u2019t the \u201cgentle giant\u201d his sympathizers made him out to be and that demonstrators on both sides of the issue in Ferguson, Missouri, are reacting emotionally without getting all their facts straight.", "title": "Bill Maher: Michael Brown \u2018was acting like a thug\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/26/bill-maher-michael-brown-was-acting-like-a-thug/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/28/bill-maher.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/28/bill-maher.jpg", "description": "Late night comedian Bill Maher argued Friday that Michael Brown wasn't the \"gentle giant\" his sympathizers made him out to be and that demonstrators on both sides of the issue in Ferguson, Missouri, a", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Bill Maher: Michael Brown \u2018was acting like a thug\u2019"}, "Author": "Jessica Chasmar", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Michael Brown, Ferguson"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe3a\"", "article_summary": "He was acting like a thug, not like a gentle giant.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but Michael Brown\u2019s people say he is a gentle giant,\u201d he said.\nLate night comedian Bill Maher argued Friday that Michael Brown wasn\u2019t the \u201cgentle giant\u201d his sympathizers made him out to be and that demonstrators on both sides of the issue in Ferguson, Missouri, are reacting emotionally without getting all their facts straight.\nNo, he wasn\u2019t a gentle giant.\nMissouri police have been brushing up on constitutional rights and stocking up on riot gear to prepare for riots that are expected if Officer Wilson is not indicted."}
