That bit of good news was tempered by a whopping loss for the hospital\u2019s Windemere Nursing and Rehabilitation Center unit, which ended its fiscal year with a $624,489 net loss, including revenue from donations.\n\nIn a discussion with The Times that accompanied the release of the figures Friday, hospital administrators described the pressures and costs that affect all health care providers and those unique to a small Island community where the responsibility to care for aged residents is not always a question of balancing black and red ink on a ledger sheet. State and federal reimbursements are the largest factors that affect the bottom line in both institutions.\n\nBecause Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital is designated a critical access hospital, it receives cost-based federal reimbursements. A recent change in state law also now provides cost-based reimbursement to the hospital for patients who qualify for state Medicaid, also known as MassHealth. But there has been no change in reimbursements paid to the only Island nursing home that accepts residents on Medicaid.\n\nProfit and loss\n\nIn FY13, the hospital had total operating revenues of $62,049,056 and total operating expenses of $60,398,396, which resulted in a gain from operations of $1,650,660, for a slim operating margin of 2.7 percent.\n\nDonations totaling $1,105,114 and investment income of $894,536 boosted the total gain, or profit, to $3,650,310, and the total margin, the percentage of gain compared to total revenue, to 5.9 percent, according to a statement of operations provided to The Times.\n\nOn the Windemere side of the ledger, the nursing home had total operating revenues of $6,446,714 against total operating expenses of $7,119,034 for a loss of $672,320. That figure was buffered somewhat by donations that totaled $43,831.\n\nNet loss\n\nWindemere ended FY13 with a decrease in revenue of about $500,000, compared to the previous year. Total operating expenses increased only slightly over FY 12, about $30,000. But in an industry where profits are hard to come by, the shift was significant.\n\nFor aged Islanders who are no longer able to care for themselves and who do not have significant financial resources or long-term care insurance, Windemere is often the only option to remain on the Vineyard.\n\nThe cost of care in Windemere is about $380 per day, or about $138,000 annually. But even as costs of care have increased, Medicaid reimbursements have not increased in six years, administrator Ken Chisholm said.\n\nAt the same time, the resident mix between private payers and those on Medicaid has shifted in favor of Medicaid. Even at 96 percent occupancy, Windemere loses money, Mr. Chisholm said, because payments do not cover the cost of service.\n\nIt loses more money when Medicaid does not pay for care already given. As an example, Mr. Chisholm described one case in which a woman was given a bed on the assumption that she would qualify for Medicaid. One year down the road, Windemere learned that a complication with a reverse mortgage made her ineligible for Medicaid, but there was no equity in the house and no money left. Windemere absorbed that loss.\n\nMr. Chisholm said a mainland institution might have initially refused to admit the woman without payment up front. Windemere chose not to do that on the assumption that the house or Medicaid would pay the bill.\n\nMr. Chisholm said Windemere may take more risks. \u201cWe are an Island, and we try to take care of the Island,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Medicaid payments are the same across the state, Island costs are significantly higher. For example, he said, Windemere paid more than $30,000 just to transport laundry by ferry to a facility in New Bedford.\n\nFor now, hospital leaders are making an appeal to the Department of Public Health for rate relief that would take into account higher Island expenses for labor and housing.\n\nStrong medicine\n\nMartha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital ended FY2012 with a net gain of only $400,678. One year later, the gain had increased by $3,249,632.\n\nHospital administrators pointed to several reasons for the increase in profitability.\n\nEdward Oliver, hospital chief financial officer, said the Affordable Care Act allowed MVH to use its critical care access designation to qualify for the 340B contract pharmacy program, a program under which it now purchases drugs at a discounted rate, and it can also provide those drugs through retail pharmacies. That program helped boost revenues by $500,000. The increase in state Medicaid reimbursement rates also helped, he said.\n\nIn FY13, donation income also increased by $323,000 and investment income increased by more than $884,000, a reflection of the strong stock market.\n\nCost of care\n\nAn increase in patient volumes boosted patient service revenues from $57,979,146 to $62,768,181. That gain was diminished in part by an increase in free care from $3,446,890 to $3,924,776, which brought net patient service revenue down to a total of $58,843,405.\n\nSo-called free care increased from $3,446,890 in FY12 to $3,924,776 in FY13.\n\nBy law, with some exceptions, all residents of Massachusetts must have health coverage that meets new federal standards.\n\nAsked why, if health insurance is mandated, the hospital is still picking up the tab, Mr. Oliver said, \u201cThe law doesn\u2019t cover everyone.\u201d\n\nThose not covered would include non-citizens and people waiting for MassHealth eligibility. Much of the cost is incurred in the emergency room, he said.\n\nThose who fall outside the insurance system rely on the state\u2019s Safety Net program. All hospitals contribute to that program, and in 2013 MVH paid $374,000 into it. Although the hospital bills the safety net program and the program keeps an account of the bills, it does not reimburse the hospital. Bad debt, in which people may not pay their deductibles, is another contributing factor to the free care number.\n\nMVH does receive some compensation from the safety net program for its dental clinic charges, Mr. Oliver said.\n\nTim Walsh, hospital chief executive officer, said the free care figure is expected to drop as the Affordable Care Act kicks in.\n\nOn the expense side, labor, both internal and external, accounted for $10.6 million in expenses. Mr. Oliver said outside programs and skilled clinical personnel include MGH anesthesiologists and radiologists and the hospital\u2019s MGH cancer center, which now allows people to be treated on-Island.\n\nMVH also added a new orthopedic surgeon at significant investment. The addition now means the hospital has 24/7 orthopedic coverage in the operating room.\n\nStrength in numbers\n\nAsked if Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital is financially healthy, Mr. Walsh answered, \u201cVery healthy.\u201d\n\nMr. Walsh pointed to the balance sheet, which lists assets and liabilities. \u201cIt tells you what you are worth today,\u201d said Mr. Walsh.\n\nThe hospital has $34,566,691 in assets \u2014 cash in various designated accounts, some of which are set aside for specific purposes. Of that, the board controls approximately $16.5 million. That money is used to replenish accounts and fund new programs.\n\n\u201cThat is where the strength of the hospital is,\u201d Mr. Walsh said. \u201cWe have no debt, a brand-new hospital, and substantial cash right now.\u201d\n\nThe new hospital accounts for an asset worth $56,168,813. Total assets are listed at $110,602,931.\n\nAgainst that figure are $9,051,346 in total current liabilities and $3,469,805 in long-term liabilities that include a mortgage of only $931,449.\n\nDespite being in the red, Windemere\u2019s balance sheet has been helped by an investment from Massachusetts General Hospital of about $3 million to upgrade the aging building.\n\nThe nursing home shows $9,078,768 in assets and liabilities of $3,364,675.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPinterest\n\nGoogle\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Martha's Vineyard Times", "description": "The hospital ended the fiscal year in the black, but Windemere lost $670,000.", "title": "Budget news mixed for Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital - Martha's Vineyard Times", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.mvtimes.com/mvt/uploads/2014/02/Windemere-outside-2.jpg", "height": 800}, "updated_time": "2014-07-09T16:52:01-04:00", "url": "http://www.mvtimes.com/2014/02/19/budget-news-mixed-for-marthas-vineyard-hospital/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2014-02-19T17:28:21-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-09T16:52:01-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Nelson Sigelman"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8602\"", "article_summary": "Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital (MVH) ended its most recent fiscal year on September 30, 2013 (FY13), with a net total profit of $3,650,310.\nAlthough the hospital bills the safety net program and the program keeps an account of the bills, it does not reimburse the hospital.\nBecause Martha\u2019s Vineyard Hospital is designated a critical access hospital, it receives cost-based federal reimbursements.\nProfit and lossIn FY13, the hospital had total operating revenues of $62,049,056 and total operating expenses of $60,398,396, which resulted in a gain from operations of $1,650,660, for a slim operating margin of 2.7 percent.\nOn the Windemere side of the ledger, the nursing home had total operating revenues of $6,446,714 against total operating expenses of $7,119,034 for a loss of $672,320."}
