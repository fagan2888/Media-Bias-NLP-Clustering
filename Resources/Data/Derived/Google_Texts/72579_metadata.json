The security forces were pretty good. But that was because we had a presence and we had influence so we could restrain [former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki\u2019s] worst instincts, which were anti-Sunni, and we could ensure that the leaders of the Iraqi security forces were competent and well-trained, instead of a bunch of political hacks, which is who Maliki\u2019s people put in place.\u201d\n\nAsked about how America\u2019s veterans must feel after sacrificing so much in a country that has all but imploded, he confessed he couldn\u2019t say with certainty.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine what some of the troops are thinking,\u201d he said. \u201cTo see it under the control of this group.\"\n\nSignificantly, however, he also addressed a question many Republican presidential candidates have been asked on the campaign trail lately\u2014namely, was the decision to invade (and liberate) Iraq ultimately the right one?\n\n\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s not the important question because you can\u2019t re-litigate history,\u201d he intoned. \u201cYou don\u2019t know who your advisors would have been, or how you would have interpreted the intelligence. The more important question, it seems to me, is what are the lessons to be learned of what we did\u2014and of the mistakes that were made\u2014so we don\u2019t make those mistakes again?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the important question,\u201d he added.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not anymore..05/26/2016 19:24:56PM EST.", "author": "Daniel Doherty", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Not anymore.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Robert Gates: Iraq Was in \"Good Shape\" in 2010 and Early 2011", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/05/19/gates-n2000940", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/205/d6b8ef48-6edc-4675-8a9c-741990ad2a7b.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Not anymore.", "title": "Daniel Doherty - Robert Gates: Iraq Was in \"Good Shape\" in 2010 and Early 2011", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/danieldoherty/2015/05/19/gates-n2000940", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/205/d6b8ef48-6edc-4675-8a9c-741990ad2a7b.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Robert Gates: Iraq Was in \"Good Shape\" in 2010 and Early 2011, Daniel Doherty, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe truth is we had the situation in pretty good shape in 2010, first part of 2011,\u201d he said.\nThe security forces were pretty good.\n\u201cI think the security in Iraq was pretty good.\n\u201cFrankly, it\u2019s not the important question because you can\u2019t re-litigate history,\u201d he intoned.\nHe reminded the audience that while the situation in Iraq is becoming increasingly more dangerous, the country was, in fact, relatively stable just a few short years ago."}
