Jim Gillen, who retired after 23 seasons as the Denver Nuggets’ trainer and travel coordinator, has accepted a job as associate athletic director for facilities and community engagement at Metro State in Denver and will oversee the athletic training program, the school announced on Thursday.

“Jim will be a great addition to our staff,” Joan McDermott, the school’s director of athletics, said in a statement. “He brings a wealth of knowledge that will help with coordinating events at The Regency Athletic Complex at MSU Denver and enhance our athletic training staff and program.”

“I’m just ready to be home more,” Gillen said before his retirement. “Have some weekends, have some evenings. It’s just a matter of being gone all the time. You want to be at home with family, kids and stuff like that.”

Gillen was the assistant athletic trainer for the Denver Broncos from 1987-90 and late joined the Nuggets in 1991. He didn’t missed a game or a practice in 23 years with the team — which works out to 1,918 games, including playoffs. He was the longest-tenured trainer in Nuggets history, working for nine head coaches, four interim head coaches, five general managers, and 197 players.
