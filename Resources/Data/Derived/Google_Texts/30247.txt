Snow days will be followed by makeup days for Mississippi public school students who stayed home in January and February because of snow and ice.

At least 130 of the state's 151 school districts missed some time because of the weather, even if it was only a late start or an early dismissal, according to a survey by the state Department of Education. They will have to make up the time, after the state Board of Education rejected requests from 34 districts last month to forgive some or all missed days.

State law requires that students attend school 180 days a year. The state can waive those requirements when the governor declares a state of emergency, as he did during the January and February winter storms.
