As a result, families that enroll in those plans could face significantly higher cost-sharing if they seek care at Children\u2019s than if they seek care at the plans\u2019 preferred providers.\n\nThe higher cost-sharing could seriously disrupt care for families currently receiving services at Children\u2019s and could delay new patients from getting the specialized care they need, said Dr. Sandy Melzer, the hospital\u2019s senior vice president and chief strategy officer.\n\nMelzer said parents may be enrolling in health plans through the exchange without realizing that Children\u2019s is not included in the plan\u2019s network.\n\n\u201cThe notion that a major insurance plan is going to exclude us from their network is truly precedent-setting and represents a new level of degradation in children\u2019s access to care,\u201d Melzer said.\n\nOf the seven insurers offering plans in King County, only two \u2013 Group Health Cooperative and Community Health Plan of Washington \u2013 are offering plans through the exchange that include Seattle Children\u2019s in their network.\n\nThe five in King County that do not include Children\u2019s in their network are Premera Blue Cross, LifeWise Health Plan of Washington (a subsidiary of Premera), BridgeSpan (a subsidiary of Regence Blue Shield), Molina Healthcare and Coordinated Care.\n\nKaiser Foundation of Health Plan of Washington, which is offering plans only in Clark and Cowlitz counties, also does not include Seattle Children\u2019s in its network.\n\nChildren\u2019s is asking that the OIC reverse its decision to allow Molina and Coordinated Care to sell plans on the exchange as long they do not include the hospital in their networks.\n\nOIC spokeswoman Stephanie Marquis says the OIC takes concerns about access to care seriously. \u201cWe are reviewing Children\u2019s petition to see what lies at the heart of their concerns and will see how it gets resolved through the legal process,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"t_omni_path": "st|health|healthcarecheckup|article", "description": "Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital filed suit Friday over the state Office of the Insurance Commissioner\u2019s \u201cfailure to ensure adequate network coverage\u201d in several of the health plans sold on the state\u2019s new online insurance marketplace, called Washington Healthplanfinder.
