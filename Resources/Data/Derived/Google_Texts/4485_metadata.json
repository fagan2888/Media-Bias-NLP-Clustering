Now infamously known as \"The Clock Kid\" after he was arrested for bringing a clock to school that looked like a bomb. President Obama invited Mohamed to the White House and made good on his promise to meet with him.\n\nCool clock, Ahmed. Want to bring it to the White House? We should inspire more kids like you to like science. It's what makes America great. \u2014 President Obama (@POTUS) September 16, 2015\n\nI wrote about this case and the death of see something, say something, a few weeks back.\n\nLast week, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed was handcuffed by police at his Irving, Texas, high school after a teacher suspected a science project he brought to class \u2014 a homemade clock \u2014 could have been a bomb. The now famous \u201csuitcase clock\u201d didn\u2019t look like a clock, it looked like a bomb, and therefore a teacher took action to be safe and sure. Thank God the teacher was wrong. Mistakes by school officials and law enforcement officers were made and apologies for supposedly overreacting have been issued.\n\n\n\nWhile Mohamed has been cleared, there is a lot of controversy surrounding the situation that remains.\n\n\n\nThese days, if you see something and say something, you\u2019re just a paranoid bigot.\n\nNow Ahmed and his family, who have since moved to Qatar, are demanding $15 million in damages payouts from the City of Irving Texas and the local school district where the incident took place. From local Fox 4:\n\nGive us $15 million \u2013 or else.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the demand from the family of the world\u2019s most famous clockmaker, Ahmed Mohamed, to the City of Irving and Irving ISD. The city and district were each sent letters on Monday demanding money or else a lawsuit would be filed.\n\n\n\nThe family wants $10 million from the City of Irving and $5 million from Irving ISD for damages it claims Ahmed and the family suffered after the teen was arrested. The family also wants an apology from the two entities.\n\n\n\nAs the Fox 4 report notes, a foundation in Qatar has offered to pay for Mohamed's education.\n\nConsidering how beneficial this entire ordeal has been for Mohamed, it is unclear how he and his family have a case for demanding a whopping $15 million in damages, which would be paid out with taxpayers funds.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "Demands. .05/26/2016 20:34:03PM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Demands.", "title": "Clock Kid Ahmed Mohamed Wants $15 Million in Damages", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/11/23/clock-kid-ahmed-wants-15-million-in-damages-payment-n2084499", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/259/74a0ac7c-68ab-4749-a740-8c03368ffb44.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Demands.", "title": "Clock Kid Ahmed Mohamed Wants $15 Million in Damages", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2015/11/23/clock-kid-ahmed-wants-15-million-in-damages-payment-n2084499", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/259/74a0ac7c-68ab-4749-a740-8c03368ffb44.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Clock Kid Ahmed Mohamed Wants $15 Million in Damages , Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Cool clock, Ahmed.\nRemember Ahmed Mohamed?\nThat\u2019s the demand from the family of the world\u2019s most famous clockmaker, Ahmed Mohamed, to the City of Irving and Irving ISD.\nNow infamously known as \"The Clock Kid\" after he was arrested for bringing a clock to school that looked like a bomb.\nThe family wants $10 million from the City of Irving and $5 million from Irving ISD for damages it claims Ahmed and the family suffered after the teen was arrested."}
