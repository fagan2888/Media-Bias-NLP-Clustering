He said he saw the ceremony as an important step toward the eventual legalization of gay marriage in Cuba.\n\n\"It's a dream for the Cuban gay and transgender community that one day it won't be just a symbolic and we can get married, because we're also part of this changing world,\" he said, embracing Morales, 38.\n\nUruguay, Argentina and a string of U.S. states, along with several in Mexico, have legalized gay marriage or civil unions.\n\nHomosexuals were hounded and persecuted during much of the presidency of Fidel Castro. After handing power to his brother Raul, the elder Castro said he regretted his treatment of gays, and Cuba has been granting increasing rights to gays in recent years.\n\nMariela Castro, who is the most visible gay rights advocate on the island, uses her position as a member of Cuba's ruling family to push for reforms. Last year, as a member of parliament, she voted against a workers' rights bill that she felt didn't go far enough to prevent discrimination against people with HIV or with unconventional gender identities.\n\nIt was an unprecedented action in an assembly that uniformly votes unanimously in favor of government proposals.\n\nCastro did not attend the blessing ceremony, but headed a colorful gay rights march by more than 1,000 people along one of Havana's main streets.\n\nA few minutes after Mederos and Morales, Belkis Gonzalez and Maria de los Angeles Machin stepped up to receive their blessing. A couple since 1989, they raised Machin's son and Gonzalez's daughter together.\n\n\"This blessing means a lot to us,\" said Gonzalez, a 48-year-old screenwriter. \"It's a reaffirmation that we have a relationship of love and we aren't hurting anyone. If God put us together, it's because we wanted us to be united.\"\n\nThe event came a day before another manifestation of changed times in Cuba: Raul Castro's visit with Pope Francis at the Vatican.\n\nThe church and the Cuban government were in a state of open hostility in the years after the 1959 revolution that put Fidel Castro in power. But a thaw began in the 1990s. Cuba removed a constitutional clause declaring the country an atheist state, Pope John Paul II paid a momentous visit in 1998, Pope Benedict XVI visited in 2012, and Cuba made Good Friday an official holiday.\n\nRaul Castro was expected to discuss both diplomatic talks with the U.S. and the pope's planned September visit to Cuba when he visits the pontiff on Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Castro's daughter sponsors blessing of Cuban gay couples - AP News: HAVANA (AP) \u2014 The daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro .05/26/2016 11:02:10AM EST.", "author": "AP News", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "HAVANA (AP) \u2014 The daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro sponsored a blessing ceremony Saturday", "title": "AP News - Castro's daughter sponsors blessing of Cuban gay couples", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/05/09/castros-daughter-sponsors-blessing-of-cuban-gay-couples-n1996777", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015\\129\\3c99e7e9-63bb-4c53-9f3e-1ebe3a7b8506.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "HAVANA (AP) \u2014 The daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro sponsored a blessing ceremony Saturday", "title": "AP News - Castro's daughter sponsors blessing of Cuban gay couples", "url": "http://townhall.com/news/world/2015/05/09/castros-daughter-sponsors-blessing-of-cuban-gay-couples-n1996777", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/129/3c99e7e9-63bb-4c53-9f3e-1ebe3a7b8506.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Castro's daughter sponsors blessing of Cuban gay couples, AP News, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcec1c\"", "article_summary": "HAVANA (AP) \u2014 The daughter of Cuban President Raul Castro sponsored a blessing ceremony Saturday for gay couples on an island where gay marriage remains illegal.\nCastro's daughter Mariela heads Cuba's Center for Sex Education, which has been pushing for gay rights in a country with a history of persecuting homosexuals.\nCastro did not attend the blessing ceremony, but headed a colorful gay rights march by more than 1,000 people along one of Havana's main streets.\nThe event came a day before another manifestation of changed times in Cuba: Raul Castro's visit with Pope Francis at the Vatican.\nMariela Castro, who is the most visible gay rights advocate on the island, uses her position as a member of Cuba's ruling family to push for reforms."}
