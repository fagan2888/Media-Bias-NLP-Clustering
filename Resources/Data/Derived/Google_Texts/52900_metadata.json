A mill represents one-tenth of one cent for each dollar of assessed property value. Each state has an assessment ratio by which these mills are multiplied. In Wyoming, this is 9.5 percent.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe are able to tax up to 12 mills,\u201d Uinta County Clerk Lana Wilcox said, \u201c\u2026 and we are currently taxing that amount.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, depending on the economy, mills are worth more or less, and, as of now, they are worth much less than they once were.\n\n\n\nAccording to a press release issued by library director George Strawley, the library staff \u201chave endured stagnant wages since 2011 and lost 6,100 work hours since 2011.\u201d\n\n\n\nStrawley said most of the library employees are \u201cearning less than the starting wages at Walmart,\u201d even though they have more specialized skills, and nearly all of the employees are part-time. Many of them have been working at the library for several years.\n\n\n\nStrawley said that their work dedication \u201cneeds to be recognized, or we\u2019ll lose them.\u201d Strawley submitted a request that library employees be given a raise of $1 per hour and that hours be restored for each branch to better serve the public. Neither library in the Valley is open on weekends. The Uinta County Library is closed on Sunday and Monday and has reduced hours on Friday and Saturday.\n\n\n\nHowever, the county has expressed concerns that there is no way to sustain raises and more hours, as the county is seeing a continued downturn in revenue and sees no immediate hope for next year.\n\n\n\n\u201c[Revenue from] oil and gas is down an average of 45 percent from what it was last year,\u201d Wilcox said.\n\n\n\nNext year is predicted to be even worse. The county\u2019s revenues primarily come from oil and gas taxes. County Commissioner Craig Welling said that the county expects natural gas production to decline 15 to 20 percent next year.\n\n\n\nWilcox said the library isn\u2019t the only department affected by recent budget cuts.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe county employees haven\u2019t had raises for seven years,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse, the Affordable Care Act has made it unaffordable for the county to have many full-time employees, Wilcox said. Even though the library employees are not county employees, the same budget cuts are affecting everyone.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a very difficult time, and we\u2019re just trying to hang on so we don\u2019t have to take huge cuts next year,\u201d Wilcox said.\n\n\n\nWelling said the county is unable to make more appropriations.\n\n\n\n\u201cI suppose we could give [the library] more,\u201d he said, \u201cbut who do we take it from to give it to them?\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, this does not mean that the library is receiving no support. The county will be picking up the utilities costs for the Mountain View and Lyman libraries this year. This will remedy an inconsistency, as the county has been paying for the utilities costs of the Evanston branch, but not the Valley libraries. This will save the libraries $17,000 \u2013 $18,000 per year.\n\n\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware of [the inconsistency] until just recently,\u201d Welling said.\n\n\n\nWilcox said the libraries are also having about $100,000 worth of new computers installed, courtesy of the county. She said the county\u2019s IT and maintenance staff have been working to help set up and get security for the new computers.\n\n\n\nThe library also has some security concerns, some of which are being met with the current security measures being installed on the new computers. This is partially motivated by the fact that two laptops were stolen from the library in recent years.\n\n\n\nThe county has agreed to set aside about $80,000 to install a security system for the libraries, including security cameras and anti-theft systems.\n\n\n\nHowever, Strawley would like to put these purchases and installations on hold for a little while in order to reevaluate the immediate need for such systems.\n\n\n\n\u201cI want to take a more cautious look at it,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nStrawley has instead proposed that the money appropriated for security systems be used to boost the library for the coming year by raising wages, increasing hours and purchasing materials, as the library\u2019s materials budget has been cut entirely in past years.\n\n\n\nHe said if the economy continues to shrink, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have bigger problems than just the $1 an hour raise.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe emphasized that, from what he has seen, \u201ceverybody in this whole process \u2026 wants to see our libraries thrive.\u201d The problem is that people disagree over what the best approach is to help the libraries survive long-term. There are currently discussions over whether closing one of the libraries in the Valley would be a good move to give the entire county library system more support and resources.\n\n\n\nIf this drastic step were to be utilized, Strawley said, \u201cwe\u2019d probably look for ways to fill essential open positions with staff from the affected location.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe main issue is that the county and the libraries are seeking a balance between being careful for the future and using the resources available for current needs.\n\n\n\nPart of this discussion will also involve the definition of what a library is, especially in the 21st century. When asked about what he believes a library is and does, Welling said that he believes the most pressing need in the Uinta County community is \u201cthe increasing demand [for] computers and the Internet, whether it be for job applications or research.\u201d The county\u2019s support of technological resources and new computers is specifically designed to meet this need.\n\n\n\nStrawley has a slightly different vision, for he said that the libraries exist to \u201cgive people an opportunity to learn how to become information-literate \u2026 in the flood of information\u201d with which everyone is currently inundated.\n\n\n\nBoth Welling and Strawley believe that libraries have changed in purpose from past traditional functions, extending now to online resources, makerspaces, and the like.\n\n\n\nStrawley hopes to continue \u201cpublicly examining options with the help of an advisory committee representing the library and the larger community.\u201d He said input from the community is welcome in this ongoing discussion.
