A Nebraska man was sentenced Tuesday to 180 days in jail for driving drunk with a car full of chickens, many of them crushed to death.

Luis Motola-Placio, 36, was stopped by Grand Island police in January for driving with his headlights off , according to 1011Now.

Motola-Placio was visibly drunk, officers said, and in the back of his car he had a cage filled with 100 chickens, according to Gawker. Many of the chickens died while trapped in the vehicle.

Only 58 of the 100 chickens were alive. The other 42 had been crushed under the weight of chickens on top. None of the birds were in cages.

The surviving 58 chickens were taken to the Central Nebraska Humane Society after the early morning stop.

"Do I think the chickens have been abused? Absolutely! If you could see the pictures of the width and depth that they were kept in, they literally crushed each other because there was no place to move and at this time we don't even know how long they were in the vehicle," said Laurie Dethloff, the Executive Director of the Central Nebraska Humane Society.
