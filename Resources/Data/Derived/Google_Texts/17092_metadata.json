Mehrens uncovered similar behavior at other agencies.\n\nAt the IRS, 286 full-time staffers worked exclusively for the National Treasury Employees Union while receiving government paychecks in 2012 (the latest year for which statistics were available).\n\nMehrens\u2019 group exposed several other agencies that fully fund union business with public money. These include:\n\nVeterans Affairs. The scandal-scarred VA has more than 250 employees working full-time for the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Association of Government Employees, the National Federation of Federal Employees and the Service Employees International Union.\n\n\u201cAt least one of these 250 doesn\u2019t even report to work at a department facility, but rather \u2018teleworks\u2019 from a private AFGE office in D.C.,\u201d Mehrens noted.\n\nDepartment of Transportation. Some 35 DOT employees exclusively on \u201cofficial time\u201d receive average annual salaries of $138,000. Some receive more than $170,000.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. The EPA pays more than $1.6 million per year to employees who work for their union full-time.\n\nNational Labor Relations Board. The NLRB has two employees working for their union full-time. Each makes more than $100,000 per year.\n\n\u201cUnder collective bargaining agreements between the agencies and the unions, the work that these employees do on \u2018official time\u2019 is controlled by the union, not the agency,\u201d Mehrens explained.\n\nDavid Williams, president of the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, calls the situation \u201chyper-political.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen people pay taxes, they expect their money goes to bureaucrats who are doing their job,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Personnel Management, \u201cLabor and management are equally accountable to the taxpayer and have a shared responsibility to ensure that official time is authorized and used appropriately.\u201d\n\nBut accountability and transparency have been lacking.\n\nThough the OPM directs \u201cagencies (to) report official time usage on an annual basis,\u201d the office has not released data for the past two years.\n\nMeantime, Democratic candidates receive 90-plus percent of the unions\u2019 campaign contributions. Yet the Republican-controlled House of Representatives has failed to rein in the workplace subsidies.\n\n\u201cIf government unions want to have their own paid employees, that\u2019s their prerogative,\u201d Mehrens told Watchdog. \u201cAs things stand now, it\u2019s a vicious circle that increases cost of government.\u201d\n\nKenric Ward is a national reporter for Watchdog.org and chief of the Virginia Bureau.
