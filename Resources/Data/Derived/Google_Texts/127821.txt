FLORENCE, S.C. – Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told a Florence crowd on Thursday she intends to strengthen the Affordable Care Act and crack down on gun lobbyists and manufacturers that contribute to gun violence in America.

Clinton called the Affordable Care Act one of President Barack Obama’s greatest accomplishments and said she will defend it from Republican attacks during her presidency. She said to reverse affordable healthcare would hurt millions of people who desperately need it.

“I’ll make sure it goes even further and is even better,” she said to a burst of applause. “Before there was Obamacare there was what they called ‘Hillary-care,’ because I was working to achieve that in the early ‘90s and I know hard it was to do what the president got done. Imagine a tomorrow where 100 percent of us have healthcare, and it’s quality healthcare, affordable healthcare.”

About 300 people were gathered at the Cumberland United Methodist Church in Florence for the event.
