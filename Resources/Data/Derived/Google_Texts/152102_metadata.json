Speaking with delegations from over 20 countries, he is discussing a new report, summarized below. This report examines what we know about kids living in rural poverty in the U.S. and how we can best assist them to reach their full potential.\n\nIf we invest in our rural communities, especially children and families experiencing poverty in these areas, we will be building a stronger country for our future.\n\nCross-posted from the White House blog:\n\nRural America provides the vast majority of food and energy benefits for the rest of the country, is the source of nearly 90 percent of renewable water resources, and is home to important service sector and manufacturing hubs. Despite this critical role in our nation\u2019s economy, too many Americans in rural areas are not sharing in our nation\u2019s economic growth.\n\nIn 2013, 6.2 million Americans in rural areas lived in poverty, including about 1.5 million children. Moreover, in far too many of these communities, high rates of poverty have persisted for generations: Over 300 rural counties have had poverty rates of over 20 percent in every Census since 1980.\n\nWhile the fight to eliminate poverty is far from over, today, as part of the White House Rural Council\u2019s ongoing efforts to address rural child poverty, we released a report that finds that programs like refundable tax credits, Social Security, SNAP, and housing assistance lifted about 9.0 million rural people out of poverty in 2013, including about 1.6 million children.\n\nThe report, entitled Opportunity for All: Fighting Rural Child Poverty, examines poverty in rural areas, discusses the positive impact of safety net programs on reducing rural poverty, and highlights the Administration\u2019s efforts and proposals to reduce poverty and promote opportunity in rural communities.\n\nThese efforts not only reduce poverty today, but have helped cut poverty over the last 50 years. The 2014 Economic Report of the President documented that federal programs designed to reduce poverty and promote opportunity have cut poverty by more than one-third over the past 50 years. In this report, we show further that poverty in rural areas has fallen by nearly half between 1967 and 2012, compared to about one-quarter in urban areas.\n\nAmong poor rural children, programs like Social Security and SNAP have profound impacts on well-being. Social Security reduces the share of children living in deep poverty \u2014 below half the poverty line \u2014 by nearly one-half, while SNAP cuts deep child poverty by about 30 percent.\n\nIn addition to the safety net\u2019s dramatic impact on reducing hardship among urban and rural children alike, a growing body of evidence shows that federal investments that provide assistance to low-income children provide very large long-run returns. Increasing the resources available to poor children and their families improves children\u2019s education, health, and earnings outcomes later in life.\n\nYet much more needs to be done. President Obama recently remarked, \u201cIn order to ensure that all Americans are able to reach the first rung on the ladder of opportunity, we must continue to invest in the types programs that we know have worked to produce our successes to date.\u201d\n\nThe President has laid out an agenda that would do just that \u2014 make the investments needed to promote opportunity and reduce poverty in the near and long term. That agenda:\n\nEnds the sequestration cuts that would cut funding for programs like Head Start, Preschool Development Grants, Housing Choice Vouchers and Homeless Assistance Grants, job training, and rural infrastructure \u2014 programs that have been shown to help kids and families succeed\n\nMakes permanent the 2009 expansion of refundable credits and prevent a tax increase on 16 million working families with children\n\nSupports state efforts to expand Medicaid \u2014 critically important in rural areas, since nearly two-thirds of the rural uninsured live in states that elected not to expand Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act\n\nIncreases the minimum wage to ensure that no full-time worker raises his or her family in poverty\n\nHelps students access college and build their skills by proposing extending the American Opportunity Tax Credit and making two years of community college free for responsible students\n\nPrevents the harmful cuts to the safety net, including the SNAP program, proposed by the Republican budget\n\nProtects Social Security retirement and disability insurance programs, which provide critical assistance to millions of American families, including for 1.2 million rural children lifted out of poverty\n\nLeverages technology to improve access to services, including programs like HHS\u2019 Rural Child Poverty Telehealth Network Grant Program and USDA\u2019s Distance Learning and Telemedicine Grant Program, which are testing new ways to use telehealth technologies to link rural children with specialized health and human services that may not be available locally\n\nRural America continues to be a source of strength and opportunity for both the people who live there and for the nation as a whole. The Administration aims to build upon the progress we have already made in reducing rural poverty, by leveraging technology, forging new partnerships, and exploring new models of program delivery, to ensure that all kids have an opportunity to succeed.\n\nShaun Donovan is the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.
