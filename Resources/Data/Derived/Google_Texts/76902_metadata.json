He said that while \u201cI wanted to pass the bill and so I did go along with it\u2026The problem is the way it was written and implemented, we have too wide a net.\u201d\n\nWehner, ignoring the fact that the GOP once upon a time (from Nixon to George H.W. Bush) had no problems at all with the idea of contraception, complains that,\n\nObama is more liberal than Mr. Clinton was on gay rights, religious liberties, abortion rights, drug legalization and climate change.\n\nWehner also ignores, in advancing these claims, the inconvenient fact of the takeover of the Republican Party by the Religious Right, which on social issues, pushed Republicans so far to the right that Mr. Obama, whom some see as being more of a moderate Republican than a Democrat, looks like a communist in Republican eyes.\n\nBut Mr. Obama was correct in saying back in 2012 that \u201cMy policies are so mainstream that if I had set the same policies that I have back in the 1980s, I\u2019d be considered a moderate Republican.\u201d By the same token, for all that Republicans have sainted Ronald Reagan, he would not qualify as a Republican today based on his policies.\n\nI will be generous here and say that Wehner is being\u2026disingenuous. The whole country is more liberal on gay rights than it was when Clinton was president. One could say \u2013 with great accuracy \u2013 that the changes in the Democratic Party only mirror the changes in American society as a whole.\n\nPolling data proves this. In fact, Mr. Obama began his first term behind a growing consensus in America that there was nothing wrong with marriage equality. His views, as he put it, like the nation\u2019s, \u201cevolved.\u201d\n\nAs for religious liberties, there were religious liberties then and there are religious liberties now. The federal RFRA \u2013 the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 \u2013 was written to protect religious minorities.\n\nThe Republican-backed RFRA\u2019s of today are written to legalize the persecution of the LGBT community. Rather than protect religious minorities, these Republican RFRA\u2019s protect bigots acting under the dubious sanctity of religious belief.\n\nThey are apples and oranges. And, in fact, the federal RFRA had broad bipartisan support at the time it was written into law. Just a few years later, it wasn\u2019t good enough. Rather than minority religious belief, Republicans wanted their \u201cbeliefs\u201d protected.\n\nOne of Wehner\u2019s problems is that his op-ed is nothing but assertions. He backs none of it up with hard facts. As Chain pointed out yesterday, \u201cWehner does not explain his disagreements with the quantitative measures, or mention their existence.\u201d\n\nOf course not. They would disprove his claims immediately. And here is why:\n\nSo rather than deal with actual evidence (and when was a Bush official ever willing to look at the actual evidence?) Wehner presses ahead with his assertions.\n\nHe outdoes himself when he says that Obama \u201cis the first president to essentially nationalize health care.\u201d\n\nOf course, President Clinton tried to reform healthcare as well, and if he had succeeded, he would have been the first president to do so \u2013 back in the Gingrich era. As it happens, Mr. Clinton campaigned on healthcare reform in 1992 with a goal of universal healthcare for all Americans.\n\nDemocrats weren\u2019t against the Clinton healthcare initiative. Newt Gingrich was.\n\nWhat is interesting is that Obamacare is based on \u201cRomneycare.\u201d Under attack in 2012 for having done something conservative approved of in 2006 (yes, a difference of only six years), Mitt Romney said, \u201cwe got the idea of an individual mandate\u2026from [Newt Gingrich], and [Newt] got it from the Heritage Foundation.\u201d\n\nFor that reason, the Affordable Care Act serves as a curative to Wehner\u2019s thesis: the Obamacare individual mandate was a conservative idea to begin with. Liberals would have preferred single-payer. They still do.\n\nIn fact, you may be suspecting by now that Wehner bases his comparison of Democratic and Republican parties entirely on a flawed comparison of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.\n\nThis is a dubious methodology at best.\n\nWehner asserts that \u201cOne can also plausibly argue that the Republican Party is the governing party in America\u201d on the basis of midterm victories in 2010 and 2014 and a preponderance of state governors (31-18) and state legislatures (\u201c68 of 98 state legislative chambers\u201d).\n\nHe concludes from this that \u201cThe Obama years have been politically good for Mr. Obama; they have been disastrous for his party.\u201d\n\nRight. Which is why Republicans have already done and will continue to do anything short of murder to keep Hillary Clinton away from the Democratic primaries. Democrats are so unpopular right now that there are more of us than ever before, and Hillary is outpolling the top Republican candidates in their own states. Bernie Sanders can even promote Scandinavian-style socialism without being booed off the planet.\n\nThat is how much Mr. Obama has damaged the Democratic brand.\n\nIn fact, Republicans have such a difficult time understanding how Mr. Obama could have won not just once, but twice, Megyn Kelly had to remind Karl Rove in 2012, like a metaphorical slap to the face, \u201cYou keep saying that, but he won, Karl, he won.\u201d\n\nAnd having built his case on the shifting sands of things Republicans say, in Megyn Kelly\u2019s words, \u201cto make yourself feel better,\u201d Wehner concludes that,\n\nFor demographic reasons, many Democrats believe that they are riding a tide of presidential inevitability. They may want to rethink that. They are placing a very risky bet that there are virtually no limits to how far left they can go.\n\nWehner may wish to rethink the list of Republican hopefuls for 2016.\n\nBut potential candidates aside, there is no basis for a statement like this. None. It has been proven that the country as a whole has moved left on social issues. More people self-identify today as liberal than ever before.\n\nWehner can laugh off demographics, but Republican numbers will not long sustain Wehner\u2019s fantasies, and that, again, is a fact.\n\nIn the final analysis, Wehner\u2019s op-ed is the dying gasp of an outmoded political ideology that is nothing more than the reaction of a privileged few to their loss of privilege.\n\nMegyn Kelly\u2019s rebuttal of Karl Rove on Election Night 2012, asking, \u201cIs this the math you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better?\u201d is applicable here.\n\nDon\u2019t come to a debate without facts, Peter, because this isn\u2019t Fox News, and wishful thinking won\u2019t get the job done in the real world. In 2016, you\u2019ll see why that\u2019s true. You\u2019ll just deny it.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Peter Wehner says the liberal claim that Republicans are the ones who have become more extreme over the years is a \"self-flatting but false narrative.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Hrafnkell Haraldsson", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "Peter Wehner says the liberal claim that Republicans are the ones who have become more extreme over the years is a \"self-flatting but false narrative.\"", "title": "Former Bush Adviser Claims Democrats Moved Further Left than Republicans Moved Right", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/05/28/bush-adviser-claims-democrats-moved-left-republicans-moved.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/peter-wehner-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-05-28T09:13:09+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Featured News,Republican Party,america,Barack Obama,Bill Clinton,contraception,Democratic Party,healthcare reform,Heritage Foundation,Hillary Clinton,Hillary Rodham Clinton,Karl Rove,Newt Gingrich,Peter Wehner,politics,Politics of the United States,Ronald Reagan,universal healthcare,politicususa,liberal,sarah jones,jason easley,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Republican Party", "published_time": "2015-05-28T08:11:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-28T09:13:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "america, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, contraception, Democratic Party, healthcare reform, Heritage Foundation, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Karl Rove, Newt Gingrich, Peter Wehner, politics, Politics of the United States, Republican Party, Ronald Reagan, universal healthcare"}, "article_summary": "In fact, Mr. Obama began his first term behind a growing consensus in America that there was nothing wrong with marriage equality.\nAs it happens, Mr. Clinton campaigned on healthcare reform in 1992 with a goal of universal healthcare for all Americans.\nHe concludes from this that \u201cThe Obama years have been politically good for Mr. Obama; they have been disastrous for his party.\u201dRight.\nThat is how much Mr. Obama has damaged the Democratic brand.\nBush) had no problems at all with the idea of contraception, complains that,Obama is more liberal than Mr. Clinton was on gay rights, religious liberties, abortion rights, drug legalization and climate change."}
