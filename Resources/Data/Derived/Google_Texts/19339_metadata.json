(Photo: Getty Images / iStockphoto) Story Highlights A proposal in the Tennessee General Assembly would repeal the broken medical malpractice system.\n\nAs we move through presidential primary season, a new poll released by the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that the cost of health care and health insurance are among the top concerns of registered voters.\n\nFalling behind only terrorism and the economy, the rising cost of health care is very much on the minds of voters across the country. That\u2019s certainly the case here in Tennessee as we approach the SEC presidential primary on March 1.\n\nVoters want solutions to one of the most expensive items in the family budget and on the corporate balance sheet. While Washington may have failed to provide a solution with the Affordable Care Act, Tennessee lawmakers are offering a bold plan to reduce health care costs during the 2016 legislative session.\n\nA proposal by state Sen. Jack Johnson, R-Franklin, and state Rep. Glen Casada, R-Franklin, would repeal the state\u2019s broken medical malpractice system and replace it with a no-blame administrative model. Under this model, physicians would no longer need to practice wasteful, defensive medicine.\n\nAfter 40 years as a hospital administrator, I can say that one of the primary drivers of rising costs can be linked to a doctor\u2019s pen.\n\nDespite efforts at cost containment, hospital administrators have little impact in preventing physicians from practicing wasteful, defensive medicine.\n\nDefensive medicine is a common practice and occurs when physicians order unnecessary tests, procedures and medications in order to avoid being sued.\n\nIt is almost impossible to reduce costs when doctors believe they must protect themselves with expensive and unnecessary CT scans, blood work, X-rays or MRIs. We can all encourage best practice models and offer incentives to reduce spending, but when a physician\u2019s entire net worth and life savings are on the line, they will continue this wasteful medicine.\n\nCharles Evans (Photo: Submitted)\n\nBioScience Valuation, a health care economics firm, reports defensive medicine cost $487 billion in the United States in 2015. In Tennessee defensive medicine runs about $13 billion annually in wasted health care costs.\n\nWhile other attempts at health care cost reduction have chipped around the edges, this plan would actually save Tennessee significant dollars in health care \u2014 more than $30 billion in public and private health plans over a decade. Florida, Georgia, Maine and Montana are considering similar plans.\n\nUnder the proposed Patients\u2019 Compensation System, patients who have been injured by a physician would no longer take their case to court. Instead, they would file a claim before an administrative panel of health care experts and an administrative law judge. If the PCS found an avoidable harm had occurred, the patient would be quickly compensated, unlike our current legal system that takes years and compensates very few injured patients.\n\nPatients would be compensated in an amount similar to what they would receive after years in the legal system. This no-blame, administrative model would eliminate the adversarial relationship between patient and doctor and allow physicians to acknowledge their errors without fear of litigation.\n\nDuring my 40 years of leading hospitals, I can say that the majority of physicians I met have been sued \u2014 many under frivolous circumstances. As a result, doctors have changed their behavior to practice defensive medicine in order to protect themselves.\n\nSince the 1980s, we in the health care field have lamented soaring costs. In recent years as consumers have had to share more of the burden, they, too, have come to terms with the unsustainable price of health care with astounding premium hikes, co-pays and deductibles.\n\nAdopting a PCS model in Tennessee would do more to reduce health care expenses than any policy change I have seen in my career. It will make Tennessee a national leader in doing what Washington has failed to do: make health care affordable and the medical liability system expedient, predictable and healthier for taxpayers, patients and doctors.\n\nEvans is president of International Health Services and is vice chairman of the nonprofit Patients for Fair Compensation. He retired as president of Hospital Corporation of America (HCA), Eastern Group based in Nashville and held senior hospital executive positions in Indiana, Florida and North Carolina.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1SY4Qe6", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "A proposal in the Tennessee General Assembly would repeal the broken medical malpractice system.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "A proposal in the Tennessee General Assembly would repeal the broken medical malpractice system.", "title": "Tennessee health care needs bold approach to cut costs", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/02/03/tennessee-health-care-needs-bold-approach-cut-costs/79674542/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A proposal in the Tennessee General Assembly would repeal the broken medical malpractice system.", "creator": "@tennessean", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0312cb4695e1dcd8576219a93bc8715565367da8/c=250-0-1752-1502&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2016/02/01/Nashville/Nashville/635899605312992894-Malpractice.jpg", "title": "Tennessee health care needs bold approach to cut costs", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/CT scans", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/CT scans", "title": "Tennessee health care needs bold approach to cut costs", "author": "Charles R.
