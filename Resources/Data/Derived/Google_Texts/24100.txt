I read the article “To reshape U.S. politics, in Trump they trust,” [Local News, May 22] with disbelief.

Trump wants to cut taxes on the rich. He wants to get rid of Dodd-Frank, which would delight rich bankers. He says he is no longer going to self-finance his campaign. He is rushing into the arms of the Republican Party establishment, asking for the endorsement of regular establishment Republicans like the speaker of the House.

How is he going to shake things up? He has adopted the Republican Party establishment position on policies like getting rid of Obamacare. It seems to me Trump is just another rich establishment Republican candidate.

And has anyone surveyed farmers in the Yakima Valley about their need for immigrant labor?
