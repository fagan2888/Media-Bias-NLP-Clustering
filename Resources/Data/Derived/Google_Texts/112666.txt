Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe addresses Congress on Wednesday to make the case for the Trans-Pacific Partnership — a 12-nation pact that would create the world’s largest free-trade zone, ranging from Canada to Chile, Australia, Malaysia and Vietnam.

It’s a major moment for Abe, given Japan’s history of trade protectionism, and comes as the Senate prepares to vote on giving President Obama fast-track authority to negotiate a TPP deal and bring the completed deal back to the Senate for an up-or-down vote.

For once, the Republicans aren’t Obama’s problem. It’s his fellow Democrats — pandering to unions and greens — out to sink TPP with last-minute amendments that could cripple negotiations.

Nor is it just backbenchers undermining Obama, but leaders like Harry Reid, New York’s Chuck Schumer and progressive doyenne Elizabeth Warren.

OK, some are backbenchers: New York’s junior senator, Kirsten Gillibrand also cites “serious concerns” over TPP.

And outsiders: Mayor de Blasio, that self-appointed leader of national progressives, also weighed in, calling TPP a “raw deal.”

The Democrats who voted for ObamaCare in order to find out what was in it aren’t willing to trust their president now. They’d rather curry favor with special interests.

And never mind TPP’s clear benefits — a major region opened wide to US products and services and vice versa, the international amity that comes with trade, greater combined influence over China on copyrights, etc.

President Obama deserves fast-track authority — despite his own party’s misgivings.
