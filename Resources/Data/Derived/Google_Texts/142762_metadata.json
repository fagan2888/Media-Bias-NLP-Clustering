Areas of focus for acquisitions are the United States and Britain.\n\nRelated\n\nCGI said earlier that cash generated from operating activities in the September-December quarter increased more than five-fold from a year earlier to $339.2 million. CGI also said its net debt at the end of December was $1.9 billion, down $965.9 million from a year earlier.\n\nNet income in the fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 31 increased 24.5% from a year earlier to $236.3 million. That equalled 74 cents per diluted share, one penny below analyst forecasts but up from 60 cents per share or $189.8 million a year earlier.\n\nCGI\u2019s revenue was down $100 million from a year ago to $2.54 billion. Revenues declined 12% in the United States and 9% in Canada. However, excluding extra work a year earlier from federal Obamacare and state health care exchanges, the sales were flat according to Roach.\n\nThe results propelled CGI\u2019s shares to hit an all-time high of $50.65 in intraday trading on Wednesday. They were up $3 or 6.39% at $49.92 later in the session.\n\nThe IT services company announced separately that it will renew a stock buyback program that expires Feb. 10, but it hadn\u2019t repurchased any of the publicly traded A shares between February 2014 and Jan. 23, 2015.\n\nMaher Yaghi of Desjardins Capital Markets said the results were in line with expectations, although revenues and contract bookings were below expectation and an area of ongoing concern.\n\n\u201cThat may raise questions about the sustainability of the revenue base or potential for organic growth,\u201d he wrote in a report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CGI Group said Wednesday the recent drop in energy prices presents an opportunity for the IT services company to win new business from customers in the oilpatch who are looking for ways reduce costs", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "Financial Post", "description": "CGI Group said Wednesday the recent drop in energy prices presents an opportunity for the IT services company to win new business from customers in the oilpatch who are looking for ways reduce costs", "title": "Why the oilpatch's pain could be CGI Group's gain", "url": "http://business.financialpost.com/investing/why-the-oilpatchs-pain-could-be-cgi-groups-gain", "image": "http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2015/01/cgi.jpg?quality=60&strip=all", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://business.financialpost.com", "description": "CGI Group said Wednesday the recent drop in energy prices presents an opportunity for the IT services company to win new business from customers in the oilpatch who are looking for ways reduce costs", "title": "Why the oilpatch's pain could be CGI Group's gain", "image": {"src": "http://wpmedia.business.financialpost.com/2015/01/cgi.jpg?quality=60&strip=all"}, "site": "@financialpost", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Just another WordPress.com site", "fb": {"admins": 576295511, "app_id": 138801856165024}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "Financial Post", "keywords": "investing, cgi group inc., oil prices", "google-site-verification": "UhYuz5WLj9O99xHz05IP4O2gExeR_rozYMFxe-OeqTg", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://business.financialpost.com/feed;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b4ece3189893389a03f063830eacd95c?s=16"}, "article_summary": "Areas of focus for acquisitions are the United States and Britain.\nRevenues declined 12% in the United States and 9% in Canada.\nCGI also said its net debt at the end of December was $1.9 billion, down $965.9 million from a year earlier.\nArmed with lots of cash and access to credit, Roach said the company is on the hunt for acquisitions again.\nMONTREAL \u2014 CGI Group said Wednesday the recent drop in energy prices presents an opportunity for the IT services company to win new business from customers in the oilpatch who are looking for ways reduce costs."}
