The incidents occurred between 2005 and 2008.\n\nRelated: Scores of Navy Officials Bribed with Cash, Prostitutes\n\nThe parties were reportedly held at the DEA\u2019s government-leased quarters in Colombia.\n\nSeparately, Secret Service agents were busted for hiring prostitutes in Colombia back in 2010. This time, however, the investigators allege that the prostitutes were paid for by drug cartels \u2013 and that the DEA agents were likely aware of this.\n\n\u201cThree DEA SSAs [supervisory special agents] in particular were provided money, expensive gifts, and weapons from drug cartel members,\u201d the report said.\n\nSeven of the 10 agents accused of being involved admitted to attending the parties. They each received between two and 10 days of suspension, auditors said.\n\nRelated: Scandals Rampant Among Brass While Soldiers Die\n\nInvestigators from the DEA\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility first became aware of the behavior in 2010. They concluded that hosting the parties in the agents\u2019 government-leased quarters presented a potential security risk, since all of the agents\u2019 laptops, BlackBerrys, and other government-issued devices could have been stolen.\n\nThat in turn could have exposed them to extortion, blackmail or coercion, the report said.\n\nThe allegations resulted from an IG probe in which auditors were looking into claims of sexual harassment at a handful of DOJ agencies. Those agencies include DEA, FBI and the U.S. Marshals Service.\n\nAfter the report\u2019s release, House Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) promised his committee will be holding a number of hearings on the allegations when Congress returns from its two-week recess, which begins this Friday afternoon.\n\nRelated: Oh, No! Federal Workers Aren't Able to Watch Porn Anymore!\n\n\u201cThis is terribly embarrassing and fundamentally not right,\u201d Chaffetz said in a statement. \u201cWe need to understand what\u2019s happening with the culture.\u201d\n\nAside from the numerous troubling allegations, the IG report also suggests that the DEA intentionally withheld crucial information from investigators, which delayed their entire probe.\n\n\u201cThe OIG was not given access to this case file information until several months after our request, and only after the misconduct case was closed,\u201d the IG said. \u201cOnce we became aware of the information, we interviewed DEA employees who said that they were given the impression that they were not to discuss this case with the OIG while the case remained open.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Federal agents are embroiled in a new prostitution scandal \u2013 but this time it doesn\u2019t", "title": "Sex Parties and Drug Cartels: Federal Agents Busted Again", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/26/Sex-Parties-and-Drug-Cartels-Federal-Agents-Busted-Again", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03142014_Prostitute_Sex_Worker.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/26/Sex-Parties-and-Drug-Cartels-Federal-Agents-Busted-Again", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/03142014_Prostitute_Sex_Worker.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@Briannaehley"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Federal agents are embroiled in a new prostitution scandal \u2013 but this time it doesn\u2019t", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Federal agents are embroiled in a new prostitution scandal \u2013 but this time it doesn\u2019t involve the Secret Service.\nThis time, however, the investigators allege that the prostitutes were paid for by drug cartels \u2013 and that the DEA agents were likely aware of this.\nThe Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General this morning dropped a blistering new report alleging that federal officers with the Drug Enforcement Agency had \u201csex parties\u201d with prostitutes that were paid for by drug cartels abroad.\n\u201cThree DEA SSAs [supervisory special agents] in particular were provided money, expensive gifts, and weapons from drug cartel members,\u201d the report said.\nRelated: Scores of Navy Officials Bribed with Cash, ProstitutesThe parties were reportedly held at the DEA\u2019s government-leased quarters in Colombia."}
