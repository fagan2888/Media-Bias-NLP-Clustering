Her interview this weekend with the Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg featured tweet-sized bon mots that exposed the distance between her views on foreign policy and President Barack Obama\u2019s.\n\nSome have suggested this reflects little more than an ability to read polls, as Obama\u2019s approval ratings on foreign policy continue to sink as the international scene devolves into chaos. The Wall Street Journal, happy with Clinton\u2019s hawkish pronouncements but hesitant to praise her too much, chalked them up to \u201cpolitical opportunism.\u201d Karl Rove intimated the same when he called Clinton the \u201cGoldilocks of foreign policy,\u201d positioning herself between the belligerence of President George W. Bush and the restraint of Obama. But Clinton has long been a liberal interventionist, and the sooner Democrats reckon with that, the better.\n\n[GALLERY: Cartoons on Hillary Clinton]\n\nClinton, of course, realizes her hawkishness is a tough sell. The American people may be frustrated with the current state of the world, but they still have little appetite for adventures abroad. So how do you sell intervention to people who want nothing to do with it? By recasting restraint as retreat and intervention as the truest form of patriotism.\n\nThough in her interview with Goldberg, Clinton repeatedly praised Obama\u2019s intelligence and thoughtfulness, her disdain for his foreign policy seeped through. (Awkwardly, given that as secretary of state she was responsible for executing much of it.) \u201cWhen you\u2019re down on yourself, and when you are hunkering down and pulling back, you\u2019re not going to make any better decisions than when you were aggressively, belligerently putting yourself forward,\u201d she told Goldberg. Then she directly addressed the Obama approach, which the administration has short-handed as \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid stuff.\u201d \u201cGreat nations need organizing principles,\u201d she said, \u201cand \u2018Don\u2019t do stupid stuff\u2019 is not an organizing principle.\u201d\n\nNow, it\u2019s true that the U.S. needs a set of guiding values that help leaders resist creating a foreign policy that is merely reactive or overly attuned to the vagaries of public opinion. But it\u2019s also true that the Obama administration has that: a restrained realism that Obama outlined in detail in a recent interview with the New York Times' Thomas Friedman.\n\nImplicit in Clinton\u2019s critique is a more troubling notion that Obama\u2019s foreign policy is rooted in a fundamental pessimism about America. \u201cWe don\u2019t even tell our own story very well these days,\u201d she said, an oft-repeated line from the book tour. But this time she followed it up by touting her faith in \u201can old-fashioned idea\u201d that America\u2019s victories in World War II and the Cold War were worth celebrating.\n\n[MORE: Cartoons on Syria]\n\nThe juxtaposition of those two ideas makes clear the story Clinton wants to tell: one in which she is the Reagan to Obama\u2019s Carter. It\u2019s an alluring tale: morning in America, with a bit of a twist. (Reagan, after all, wasn\u2019t Carter\u2019s secretary of state.) But the story requires rewriting history some. Obama has, after all, been telling a triumphal tale of American exceptionalism for some time now. In recent years he has declared that \u201c America must always lead on the world stage,\u201d that \u201c I believe in American exceptionalism with every fiber of my being,\u201d that \u201c America\u2019s possibilities are limitless\u2026we are made for this moment, and we will seize it.\u201d\n\nStorytelling is not the problem. What is needed is not a new American mythology that starts from a preference for American intervention and writes history backwards from there. What is needed is a clear-eyed realism that understands the possibilities and limits of power. That\u2019s the sort of story we should be telling.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Hillary Clinton Rewrites History to Bash Obama Foreign Policy", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The former secretary of state is trying to play Reagan to Obama's Carter.", "title": "Morning in Hillary Clinton's America", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/nicole-hemmer/2014/08/12/hillary-clinton-rewrites-history-to-bash-obama-foreign-policy", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/db/61/fa31ef9c4497b8f2f38ae1e9343a/140717-clintonpoll.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former secretary of state is trying to play Reagan to Obama's Carter.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Hillary Clinton Rewrites History to Bash Obama Foreign Policy"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "Aug. 12, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Nicole Hemmer,Clinton, Hillary,Obama administration,Obama, Barack,foreign policy,Middle East,picks,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The former secretary of state is trying to play Reagan to Obama's Carter."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb6d6\"", "article_summary": "Implicit in Clinton\u2019s critique is a more troubling notion that Obama\u2019s foreign policy is rooted in a fundamental pessimism about America.\nWhat is needed is not a new American mythology that starts from a preference for American intervention and writes history backwards from there.\nThough in her interview with Goldberg, Clinton repeatedly praised Obama\u2019s intelligence and thoughtfulness, her disdain for his foreign policy seeped through.\nSome have suggested this reflects little more than an ability to read polls, as Obama\u2019s approval ratings on foreign policy continue to sink as the international scene devolves into chaos.\nHer interview this weekend with the Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg featured tweet-sized bon mots that exposed the distance between her views on foreign policy and President Barack Obama\u2019s."}
