Jeb Bush of Florida opened up on a subject he had once chided reporters for asking about: his daughter, Noelle, who, he said, \u201cwas addicted to drugs.\u201d\n\nIn a video released by the campaign, Mr. Bush speaks plainly about his daughter\u2019s struggle, her time in jail and drug court, and her recovery. \u201cI can look in people\u2019s eyes and I know that they\u2019ve gone through the same thing that Columba and I have,\u201d he said, referring to his wife.\n\nMr. Bush is not the only candidate to share this sort of painful personal experience. Carly Fiorina, the former chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, has spoken out about losing her stepdaughter, Lori Ann Fiorina, to \u201cthe demons of addiction\u201d at the age of 35. And Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey spoke candidly and emotionally about a law school friend who died of a Percocet overdose.\n\nWhat\u2019s behind this newfound willingness on the candidates\u2019 part to talk about the personal toll of addiction?\n\nNew Hampshire, and the sobering statistics on drug overdoses there, is probably part of the answer.\n\nEvery day, 44 people in the United States die as a result of overdose on prescription painkillers. Every day, nearly 7,000 people are treated in emergency rooms for abusing painkillers. Overdose deaths have been creeping upward since the beginning of the 21st century \u2014 especially deaths from opiate abuse. In New Hampshire, overdose deaths linked to opiate abuse have more than doubled over the past two years.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nTed Gatsas, the Republican mayor of Manchester, N.H., said he had had many opportunities to talk to Republican candidates, including Mr. Bush, Mr. Christie, Donald J. Trump, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, about the heroin and prescription-painkiller abuse in his state. He thinks that the overdose problem has been severely underestimated, not just in his city and state, but nationwide.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t think anybody, until you put the numbers and talk to them about it, knows that it\u2019s this bad across this country,\u201d he said.\n\nNearly 50 years into the \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d which both Republican and Democratic leaders have waged in various ways, with various disastrous outcomes, drug overdoses reached a record high in 2014. From 2001 to 2014, the United States had more than a threefold increase in deaths from opioid pain relievers, and a sixfold increase in heroin overdoses, according to the National Institutes of Health. During the same period, overdose deaths from prescription drugs like Valium and Klonopin \u2014 sedatives called benzodiazepines \u2014 increased by five times.\n\nIn speaking about their own experiences, Republican candidates are not only allowing themselves to be vulnerable in front of voters, they\u2019re also straying from the just-say-no message of Ronald Reagan, whose legacy includes a tough legislative stance on drugs and drug sentencing. They\u2019re also hoping that voters, especially in early primary states, will empathize.\n\nPhoto\n\nGrant Smith, a lobbyist with Drug Policy Action, said it was remarkable how much airtime addiction was getting. \u201cIf you look over the last two decades, we\u2019ve definitely seen a transformation in how elected officials talk about people who use drugs,\u201d he said. Now there\u2019s more empathy, less scolding. He is glad to see the new rhetoric about addiction, but notes that candidates have become more open about this issue as it has started to take a real toll on largely white communities.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that the shift in who is being impacted by overdose and the attendant harms of drug use to rural and suburban communities has made lawmakers as well as candidates for office more comfortable talking about these issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that African-American communities have endured high overdose rates for decades, and few lawmakers in Washington cared.\u201d\n\nAt a forum at Southern New Hampshire University earlier this month, Governor Kasich spoke with refreshing candor about what some call this \u201cgentrification of addiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes I wonder how African-Americans must have felt when drugs were awash in their community and nobody watched,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it\u2019s in our communities, and now all of a sudden we\u2019ve got forums, and God bless us, but think about the struggles that other people had.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSo far, the proposed plans from the candidates to combat addiction have remained frustratingly vague. Mr. Bush\u2019s plan is one exception: It would increase access to drug courts, which allow some nonviolent drug offenders to undergo medical treatment instead of serving jail time, and would also reduce some mandatory minimum sentences.\n\nBeyond criminal justice reform, there is the public health aspect of providing assistance. The Affordable Care Act requires health insurance plans to cover treatment for substance abuse. The Republican candidates who want to repeal Obamacare should answer this question: If you succeed, how will you fund treatment for drug users?\n\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, The Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n\nFinally, there remains the problem of the government classification of different drugs. The Drug Enforcement Administration, formally if not informally, still considers marijuana more dangerous and more addictive than the prescription painkillers and sedatives that accounted for more than 25,000 overdose deaths in 2014.\n\nIn Manchester, as Mayor Gatsas welcomes a parade of candidates, he also sees plenty of constituents dealing with the ravages of addiction. Mothers crying, parents writing obituaries that frankly state that their sons and daughters died from heroin overdoses.\n\n\u201cWith this epidemic, it\u2019s crossed every boundary. It\u2019s young to old, rich to poor, white to black,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell them, \u2018If it hasn\u2019t affected you yet, just wait. It will.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if it\u2019s a universal issue \u2014 which is something the candidates are starting to realize too.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20160119032105, "twitter": {"description": "As overdose rates rise, candidates are opening up about the spread of addiction, hoping to connect with voters.", "title": "Just Saying Yes to the Politics of Drugs", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/opinion/campaign-stops/just-saying-yes-to-the-politics-of-drugs.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004146816"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/opinion/19rollerWeb/19rollerWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/opinion/campaign-stops/just-saying-yes-to-the-politics-of-drugs.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000004146816", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/opinion/campaign-stops/just-saying-yes-to-the-politics-of-drugs.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/campaignstops", "hdl_p": "Just Saying Yes to the Politics of Drugs", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 19, 2016", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Republican Party", "keywords": "Drug Abuse and Traffic,Presidential Election of 2016,New Hampshire,Republican Party,Bush  Jeb,Fiorina  Carleton S,Christie  Christopher J", "CN": "emma-roller", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Emma Roller", "SCG": "campaign-stops", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "per": "Christie, Christopher J", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By EMMA ROLLER", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "As overdose rates rise, candidates are opening up about the spread of addiction, hoping to connect with voters.", "tom": "Op-Ed", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "CT": "column", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/opinion/19rollerWeb/19rollerWeb-thumbStandard.jpg", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/opinion/19rollerWeb/19rollerWeb-thumbLarge.jpg", "description": "As overdose rates rise, candidates are opening up about the spread of addiction, hoping to connect with voters.", "CG": "opinion", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 19, 2016", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "Op-Ed", "article": {"section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified": "2016-01-19", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Christie, Christopher J", "published": "2016-01-19", "section-taxonomy-id": "AD8090D7-4137-4D71-84C8-70DA3BD89778"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "New Hampshire", "slug": "19roller", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20160119155637, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/opinion/campaign-stops/just-saying-yes-to-the-politics-of-drugs.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/opinion/19rollerWeb/19rollerWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "As overdose rates rise, candidates are opening up about the spread of addiction, hoping to connect with voters.", "title": "Just Saying Yes to the Politics of Drugs"}, "pdate": 20160119, "des": "Presidential Election of 2016", "nyt-collection": {"tone": "opinion", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/column/emma-roller", "tagline": "The 2016 election, political anomalies, and campaign tactics.", "uri": "/column/emma-roller", "display-name": "Emma Roller", "identifier": "emma-roller", "type": "column"}, "articleid": 100000004146816, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Just Saying Yes to the Politics of Drugs", "col": "Contributing Op-Ed Writer", "PST": "Op-Ed"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0524\"", "article_summary": "During the same period, overdose deaths from prescription drugs like Valium and Klonopin \u2014 sedatives called benzodiazepines \u2014 increased by five times.\nOverdose deaths have been creeping upward since the beginning of the 21st century \u2014 especially deaths from opiate abuse.\nIn New Hampshire, overdose deaths linked to opiate abuse have more than doubled over the past two years.\nMr. Bush is not the only candidate to share this sort of painful personal experience.\nThe Republican candidates who want to repeal Obamacare should answer this question: If you succeed, how will you fund treatment for drug users?"}
