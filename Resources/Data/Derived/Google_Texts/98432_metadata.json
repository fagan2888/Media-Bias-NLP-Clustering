Forty-three percent approve, a scant percentage point from 42 percent in November.\n\nBetter for the president is an easing of opposition to the Affordable Care Act, with attitudes back to a close division on the law; 46 percent of Americans support it, with 49 percent opposed. Opposition is down from a record 57 percent last month amid the new system\u2019s troubled rollout.\n\nThe ACA\u2019s impact to date on Americans\u2019 perceptions of the quality of their health care, coverage and costs is less negative than many anticipated when it was signed into law. But while 37 percent in 2010 expected the law to improve the health care system overall, just 19 percent now say it\u2019s actually done so. And far more, 47 percent, say it\u2019s made things worse.\n\nMany Republicans reportedly plan to make criticism of the ACA a centerpiece of their midterm election campaigns, and the approach shows promise. 2014 election preferences have tightened essentially to a dead heat, with 47 percent of registered voters now supporting the Democratic candidate in their congressional district vs. 45 percent for the Republican. That compares with an 8-point Democratic lead in October, just after the unpopular, GOP-inspired partial government shutdown and just before the HealthCare.gov meltdown.\n\nMoreover, among registered voters who oppose the health care law \u2013 in general, no fans of the Obama administration \u2013 midterm preferences stand at 64-26 percent in favor of GOP candidates.\n\n8 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nWant to read more articles like this one?
