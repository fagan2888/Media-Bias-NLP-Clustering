As for the possibility that non-smoking applicants will be disqualified by exposure to second-hand smoke, Holy Spirit says the nicotine tests will not detect such low-level doses.\n\nWhat's your opinion of employers that refuse to hire tobacco users? Is it too much snooping into employees' private lives? A form of discrimination that should be outlawed? Or a common-sense policy for organizations whose goal is keeping people healthy?", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "healthcare issue, tobacco, opinion", "title": "Holy Spirit Health System will stop hiring tobacco users.
