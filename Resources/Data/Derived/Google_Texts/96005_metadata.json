Susan Walsh/AP\n\n\u201cHow do you start out if you want to be a rap artist?\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts pondered Monday during oral arguments in Elonis v. U.S., a Supreme Court case about whether proof of intent is necessary for federal threat convictions.\n\nRoberts joined several colleagues appearing sympathetic to arguments from Pennsylvania man Anthony Elonis, released in February after more than three years behind bars for posting purported rap lyrics containing violent language on Facebook.\n\nElonis says he did not intend to threaten his estranged wife, an FBI agent, schoolchildren and police with his posts, and that proof of intent should be required for conviction.\n\nHe was found guilty under a lower standard: that a reasonable person would interpret his words as threats. Federal appeals courts are divided on the proper standard for a threat conviction, and state court systems also have different standards.\n\n[RELATED: Digital Rights, Rap Lyrics and More at Stake in Elonis Case]\n\nDomestic violence survivor groups, 18 state attorneys general and the Department of Justice have lined up against Elonis, saying his victory could imperil victims and give their abusers a free pass to creatively threaten them.\n\nJustices, however, seemed concerned Monday about how the case's outcome might affect the speech rights of a large number of Americans.\n\nRoberts asked Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben how any budding rap musician might fare if his initial song lyrics were taken at face value, and whether a reasonable person can be expected to be familiar with the style of rap music.\n\nEstablished rapper Eminem, Roberts noted, fills songs with violent language, at times targeting specific people with impunity.\n\n[ALSO: Read the Lyrics to Some of Elonis' Songs]\n\nDreeben said \"the speaker chooses their audience\" and argued the well-known rapper performs for entertainment value, whereas Elonis\u2019 words were written \u201cin the guise\u201d of lyrics \u2013 a point Elonis\u2019 attorney, John Elwood, said is discredited by the existence of older posts.\n\nRoberts wasn\u2019t just concerned with the early careers of rappers. He also worried that more popular teenage Facebook users may face a different standard for threat convictions than teens with few friends, as the size of the audience might skew a reader's reaction.\n\nJustices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, two of the three women on the court, also voiced concern about the case's First Amendment implications.\n\nKagan, noting conviction for many crimes requires proof of intent, pushed back on the government\u2019s insistence that recklessness can make someone guilty. That is \u201cnot the standard we typically use with the First Amendment,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to chill innocent behavior.\u201d\n\nSotomayor added, \u201cWe\u2019ve been loathe to create more exceptions to the First Amendment.\u201d\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia suggested that not having a requirement of intent could make a person informing Elonis\u2019 then-wife of Facebook threats criminally liable. Dreeben said that wasn\u2019t true.\n\nSome justices did appear skeptical of requiring proof of intent, however.\n\n\u201cHow does one prove what\u2019s in someone else\u2019s mind?\u201d asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a point she later repeated.\n\nEchoing the concerns of anti-domestic violence groups, Justice Samuel Alito said that describing apparent threats as lyrics, if allowable, \u201csounds like a road map for threatening a spouse.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Collections: US", "title": "Supreme Court Considers Speech Rights of Rappers, Moody Teens", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The Supreme Court weighs a case with implications for the Internet and beyond.", "title": "Justices Ponder Speech Rights of Rappers, Moody Teens", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/12/01/supreme-court-considers-speech-rights-of-rappers-moody-teens", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/b4/ff/9981337e45a6b801fd7b4c8335ac/141201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Supreme Court Considers Speech Rights of Rappers, Moody Teens", "description": "The Supreme Court weighs a case with implications for the Internet and beyond.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 1, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Steven Nelson,Pulse,picks,Supreme Court,Facebook,music,Roberts, John,Kagan, Elena,Sotomayor, Sonia,Scalia, Antonin,Ginsburg, Ruth Bader,Collections: US", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Supreme Court weighs a case with implications for the Internet and beyond."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdee81\"", "article_summary": "Federal appeals courts are divided on the proper standard for a threat conviction, and state court systems also have different standards.\nJustices, however, seemed concerned Monday about how the case's outcome might affect the speech rights of a large number of Americans.\nKagan, noting conviction for many crimes requires proof of intent, pushed back on the government\u2019s insistence that recklessness can make someone guilty.\nHe was found guilty under a lower standard: that a reasonable person would interpret his words as threats.\n\u201cHow does one prove what\u2019s in someone else\u2019s mind?\u201d asked Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a point she later repeated."}
