The United Auto Workers union has reached a tentative local agreement that will avoid a strike next week at a key Ford assembly plant.

Kansas City Assembly Plant officials say in a statement Saturday morning that the agreement was forged by working with its UAW partners. They say "plant operations will continue as scheduled" at the Kansas City Assembly Plant in Claycomo, Missouri.

No details of the tentative agreement were released. Union Vice President Jimmy Settles had previously given the company a five-day strike notice.

The 7,500-worker plant makes the F-150 pickup, Ford's most popular model, and the Transit commercial van.

Ford's national contract with the union expired Sept. 14 but workers stayed on the job under an extension.
