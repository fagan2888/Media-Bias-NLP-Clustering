District officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to a message left Saturday on the district\u2019s general line.\n\nThe suit seeks at least $200,000 for each incident of abuse, as well as unspecified punitive damages, The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported.\n\nThe tutor, Claude Fowlkes III, faces seven counts of first-degree sexual abuse of a minor. Calls to Fowlkes\u2019 public defender, Yvette Soutiere, were not immediately returned Saturday.\n\nAccording to court documents, the accuser wore a hidden microphone that recorded Fowlkes saying he regretted the sexual abuse and did not want it to continue.\n\nIn April, Fowlkes\u2019 aunt offered to serve as a third-party custodian of him until his trial, but a Fairbanks judge denied the request when he learned that 10 children were living at the aunt\u2019s home.\n\nThe lawsuit only names the district but says a former superintendent knew the abuse was taking place and failed to act. The family alleges that the district continued to employ Fowlkes after several investigations into complaints that he had inappropriate contact with students.\n\nThe family\u2019s attorney, Michael Kramer, said he has no plans to add current or former employees to the suit. The district can add the names of those it believes are responsible, but Kramer said that would be unlikely.\n\n\u201cI chose not to name individuals,\u201d Kramer said. \u201cThe district certainly recognizes that it\u2019s responsible for the actions of its employees and particularly its administrators.\u201d\n\nKramer says the suit will allow him to receive information regarding district actions that has not been released publicly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mainly to create an avenue that I can actually access information and put people under oath and get details that so far the public has not been privy to,\u201d Kramer said.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Alaska, Juneau, newspaper, news, legislature, capital, Mendenhall, Douglas, southeast, Douglas Island, Gastineau Channel, Mendenhall Glacier, Auke Bay, Salmon Creek, Lemon Creek, Switzer Creek, Mendenhall Valley, Fritz Cove, Lynn Canal, Tee Harbor, State, Claude Fowlkes III, Michael Kramer, Yvette Soutiere, Kake, Empire, juneauempire, juneauempire.com, Local, Outdoors, Weather, All access, e-edition, iPad, Sports, Real Estate, Jobs, Cars, Homes, Art, Arts & Culture, Neighbors", "og": {"site_name": "Juneau Empire - Alaska's Capital City Online Newspaper", "description": "FAIRBANKS - The family of a student who authorities say wore a hidden microphone to obtain a tutor's purported sex-abuse confession has sued the school district, saying it failed to protect the boy from the instructor.", "title": "Family alleges school district knew of sex abuse", "url": "http://juneauempire.com/state/2014-06-22/family-alleges-school-district-knew-sex-abuse", "image": "http://juneauempire.com/sites/default/files/images/sms-default-facebook-share.png", "type": "article"}, "description": "Find the latest news, crime, weather, business and community information from juneauempire.com and the Juneau Empire."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd4b4\"", "article_summary": "The Fairbanks North Star Borough School District should have identified the warning signs, the suit filed Friday claimed.\nThe tutor, Claude Fowlkes III, faces seven counts of first-degree sexual abuse of a minor.\nAccording to court documents, the accuser wore a hidden microphone that recorded Fowlkes saying he regretted the sexual abuse and did not want it to continue.\nThe suit seeks at least $200,000 for each incident of abuse, as well as unspecified punitive damages, The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported.\nThe family alleges that the district continued to employ Fowlkes after several investigations into complaints that he had inappropriate contact with students."}
