There is convincing evidence that the Senate is the greatest source of legislative dysfunction: in 2013, only 16 of the 72 bills that President Obama signed into law originated from the upper chamber, and there are currently 338 bills passed by the House that are awaiting the Senate\u2019s attention.\n\nNevertheless, one cannot discount how House obstructionism has exacerbated congressional inaction.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) \u2014 in his own role as the lower chamber\u2019s legislative gatekeeper \u2014 has a different yet effective method at his disposal to quash Democratic ideas: he can simply refuse to schedule their bills for a vote.\n\nSpeakers of the House may use what is unofficially called the \u201cHastert rule\u201d (though in 2013 a faction of the GOP petitioned to formalize the rule) by which the Speaker only brings a bill to the floor if he anticipates that a majority of his party will approve it. This practice, which ensures that the Speaker remains in good standing with those who brought him to power, also makes cooperation with the Democratic-controlled Senate less likely and facilitates legislative gridlock.\n\nSpeaker Boehner has not only used this rule to reject bills from House Democrats, but also to deny Senate bills a vote in the lower chamber. The immigration reform bill written by the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d and approved by the Senate in 2013, for instance, was never taken up by the House.\n\nBoehner\u2019s intransigent stewardship of the House can be traced back to a crucial meeting of GOP leadership shortly after President Obama\u2019s inauguration in 2009. According to Robert Draper\u2019s authoritative and tragicomic chronicling of the House, Do Not Ask What Good We Do, more than a dozen members of the Republican Party (sans Boehner) met at a high-end restaurant in the District to decide how to sabotage the Democrats\u2019 agenda.\n\nDuring their meeting, Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) \u2014 who was recently promoted from whip to House majority leader after Eric Cantor\u2019s primary defeat \u2014 is quoted as saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta challenge them on every single bill and challenge them on every single campaign.\u201d\n\nSince that fateful gathering, Boehner has been instrumental in keeping Democratic bills off the floor using the Hastert rule. Several major pieces of legislation, such as the law banning gender and sexual discrimination in the workplace and the extension of emergency unemployment compensation, have cleared the Senate but have not been considered in the House.\n\nHowever, the speaker has also kept bills off the floor to appease the tea party wing of his caucus and to prevent partisans from having to make difficult choices on controversial legislation that could hurt their re-election efforts.\n\nDuring the debates over the fiscal cliff, for instance, when the expiration of tax cuts coincided with the triggering of automatic spending cuts and threatened to plunge the country back into a recession, the speaker tabled the \u201cPlan B\u201d option that would have kept most of the tax cuts in place and increased taxes only on millionaires.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in passing something with mostly Democrat votes,\u201d Boehner said in December 2012.\n\nThough the bill likely had enough supporters in the House pass a floor vote, Boehner dumped it. Conservative advocacy groups, such as the Club for Growth, announced that they would carefully watch the roll call and would notice who supported a tax increase when deciding which candidates to endorse in the future.\n\nIn an even more extreme demonstration of House obstructionism \u2014 and in contradiction to Boehner\u2019s promise to return to \u201cregular order\u201d or normal and transparent legislative proceedings \u2013 the House Rules Committee approved a rule change that kept Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) from bringing up a vote on a continuing resolution (CR) that would have averted the government shutdown.\n\nThe proposed \u201cclean\u201d CR, which did not include the provision to defund the Affordable Care Act, likely had enough support in the House. However, the rule change gave only the house majority leader (then Cantor) the authority to bring the resolution to the floor.\n\nI\u2019m not interested in passing something with mostly Democrat votes. U.S. House Speaker John Boehner\n\nOn occasion, Boehner has risked his popularity \u2014 and his speakership \u2014 by bucking the Hastert rule and bringing bills to a vote without the support of a majority of his party. For instance, he offended the conservative caucus by approving an expansive relief package to the victims of Hurricane Sandy and by allowing the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nAnd when Boehner brought up a bill that did ultimately avert the fiscal cliff, yet lacked the support of the Republican majority, Boehner caught flak from former speaker Dennis Hastert himself, who upbraided Boehner for defying the wishes of the House members who brought him to power in the first place.\n\n\u201cWhen you start passing stuff that your members aren\u2019t in line with, all of a sudden your ability to lead is in jeopardy,\u201d Hastert said. \u201cAll tax bills and all spending bills, under the Constitution, start in the House. When you give up that responsibility you really give up your ability to govern, and that is the problem.\u201d\n\nHouse-watchers have observed that many of Boehner\u2019s \u201cestablishment\u201d allies are either retiring or in danger of losing primary challenges \u2013 a demographic change that may explain the apparent rightward shift in the speaker\u2019s governance, such as moving forward with a lawsuit challenging the president on his executive overreach.\n\nWhile it is uncertain how these dynamics will change in November, or whether Boehner will stay on as speaker, it is difficult to imagine how the upcoming 114th Congress could exceed the record-setting dysfunction of the current 113th \u2014 unless it can one-up the current House and vote 55 times to repeal or radically amend the Affordable Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. House Speaker John Boehner has contributed to House obstructionism and congressional dysfunction by using the Hastert rule to keep Democratic bills off the floor.", "og": {"site_name": "IVN.us", "description": "U.S. House Speaker John Boehner has contributed to House obstructionism and congressional dysfunction by using the Hastert rule to keep Democratic bills off the floor.", "title": "How John Boehner Has Facilitated Congressional Gridlock - IVN.us", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 550, "identifier": "http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/boehner-gavel.jpg", "height": 331}, "updated_time": "2014-07-27T21:34:45-07:00", "url": "http://ivn.us/2014/07/28/john-boehner-facilitated-congressional-gridlock/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "U.S. House Speaker John Boehner has contributed to House obstructionism and congressional dysfunction by using the Hastert rule to keep Democratic bills off the floor.", "title": "How John Boehner Has Facilitated Congressional Gridlock - IVN.us", "image": "http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/boehner-gavel.jpg", "creator": "@IVN", "site": "@IVN", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-07-28T05:00:54-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 322111017868621, "pages": 233116802464}, "keywords": "Congress, John Boehner, Harry Reid, congressional gridlock, politics, Republican Party, Democratic Party,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IVN", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "tea party", "published_time": "2014-07-28T05:00:54-07:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-27T21:34:45-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "congress, john boehner, republican party, tea party, politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea97\"", "article_summary": "Speaker Boehner has not only used this rule to reject bills from House Democrats, but also to deny Senate bills a vote in the lower chamber.\nThough the bill likely had enough supporters in the House pass a floor vote, Boehner dumped it.\nHowever, the rule change gave only the house majority leader (then Cantor) the authority to bring the resolution to the floor.\nU.S. House Speaker John BoehnerOn occasion, Boehner has risked his popularity \u2014 and his speakership \u2014 by bucking the Hastert rule and bringing bills to a vote without the support of a majority of his party.\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) \u2014 in his own role as the lower chamber\u2019s legislative gatekeeper \u2014 has a different yet effective method at his disposal to quash Democratic ideas: he can simply refuse to schedule their bills for a vote."}
