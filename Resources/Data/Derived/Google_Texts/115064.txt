Authorities suspect a mother was driving under the influence of drugs Tuesday when she plunged off a bridge just southeast of Denver, leaving her seriously injured and sending three children to the hospital.

The single-vehicle wreck happened at about 10 a.m. near the intersection of East Iliff Avenue and South Trenton Way in an unincorporated part of Arapahoe County, the Colorado State Patrol said.

Trooper Nate Reid said the vehicle, an SUV, was heading east on Iliff before the crash.

The state patrol says all three children were in child seats.

The mother, identified as 54-year-old Donna Pierre, of Denver, was ejected from the SUV and taken to Aurora South Hospital for treatment, Reid said.

Pierreâ€™s three children, a 2-year-old boy and two 7-year-old girls, were also taken to Aurora South Hospital. Reid said the three kids were uninjured.

Photos from the scene showed a red SUV badly mangled and resting below what appeared to be a damaged bridge.

Charges in the wreck are pending.
