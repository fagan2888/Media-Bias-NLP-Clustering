Most workers\u2019 compensation carriers in Louisiana use the NCCI annual loss cost filing to calculate their insurance rates.\n\nThe most recent decrease in workers' compensation loss costs was at 4.3 percent in 2010. The 5.1 percent drop marks a cumulative 35-percent drop since 2004.\n\nAccording to the Louisiana Department of Insurance, the top five workers\u2019 compensation insurance writers in Louisiana in 2012 were Louisiana Workers\u2019 Compensation Corporation with 21.0 percent, Liberty Mutual Group at 12.6 percent, LUBA Casualty Insurance Co. with 8.8 percent, American International Group at 7.4 percent and Zurich Group with 7.2 percent. Louisiana's total workers\u2019 compensation market is estimated to be about $900 million in total premium.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Renita D.
