He warned iPhone users that the development of new iOS software undermining encryption would deteriorate data security and establish a \u201cdangerous precedent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, this software\u2014which does not exist today\u2014would have the potential to unlock any iPhone in someone\u2019s physical possession,\u201d Cook wrote.\n\nStimson cautioned that the program could ultimately make its way to other nations, including governments hostile to the U.S., and land in the hands of terrorist organizations, whose members could then decrypt all iPhones.\n\n\u201cThis is not Apple giving the palm to law enforcement at large, this is not Apple giving the middle finger to the federal government,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is Apple saying, \u2018This is a step too far.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe court is specifically ordering Apple to disable the function that erases the data on an iPhone after a user enters an incorrect password 10 times. This could help FBI agents break into Farook\u2019s phone using \u201cbrute force,\u201d where tech experts test the 10,000 possible password combinations without damaging data.\n\nApple would also be compelled to develop a custom-made program that could override its encryption software, which Stimson notes the company has spent decades creating.\n\nThe Obama administration defended the Justice Department\u2019s request Wednesday, vowing that the government would solely use the new program on Farook\u2019s phone.\n\n\u201cThey are not asking Apple to redesign its product or to create a new backdoor to one of their products,\u201d press secretary Josh Earnest said at a White House briefing. \u201cThey\u2019re simply asking for something that would have an impact on this one device.\u201d\n\nDavid Inserra, a policy analyst in homeland security and cyber-security at The Heritage Foundation, said the issue should be handled by Congress.\n\nWith the 2016 election dominating congressional attention, Inserra said legislation likely would not move this year. Though even without the election, he said lawmakers could be hesitant to do anything because of the tendency to defend encryption.\n\n\u201cBased on prior issues somewhat like this, this does not cut straight down party lines,\u201d Stimson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "How do we balance privacy and security in our modern era?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "How do we balance privacy and security in our modern era?", "title": "Apple Fight With FBI Raises Privacy, Security Issues", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160217_AppleFBI_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-18T12:47:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/20ZYMGX"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "How do we balance privacy and security in our modern era?", "title": "Apple Fight With FBI Raises Privacy, Security Issues", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160217_AppleFBI_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "cybersecurity", "published_time": "2016-02-17T19:14:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-18T12:47:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Apple, FBI, encryption, San Bernardino, Syed Rizwan Farook, Tim Cook, ISIS, Islamic State, security, ISIS"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is the ultimate technological Catch-22,\u201d Cully Stimson, national security law program manager and senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, told The Daily Signal.\nExperts warn that heeding to the FBI\u2019s call for Apple to create a \u201cbackdoor\u201d reversing encryption would have sweeping consequences extending beyond this particular phone.\n\u201cBased on prior issues somewhat like this, this does not cut straight down party lines,\u201d Stimson said.\n\u201cThis is not Apple giving the palm to law enforcement at large, this is not Apple giving the middle finger to the federal government,\u201d he said.\nApple would also be compelled to develop a custom-made program that could override its encryption software, which Stimson notes the company has spent decades creating."}
