The interim government in Central African Republic has chosen a regional banking official to serve as prime minister.

The presidency announced Saturday the selection of Andre Nzapayeke, who has held several positions with the Central African States' Development Bank, called BDEAC by its French acronym.

An interim government is being formed since coup leader Michel Djotodia stepped aside nearly 10 months after he and thousands of armed fighters overthrew the president in March 2013.

A national transitional council already has chosen Bangui Mayor Catherine Samba-Panza to serve as president, making her the country's first female leader.

Critics already question how much power the transitional government can wield, as thousands of African and French peacekeepers have been unable to stop mounting sectarian attacks between Christian and Muslim militias and civilians.
