But what\u2019s also true, obviously, is that philosophy is wrapped up in the history of states\u2019 rights in the context of the civil-rights movement and the Civil War and Calhoun. There\u2019s a pretty long history there. And so I think it\u2019s important for progressives not to dismiss out of hand arguments against my Presidency or the Democratic Party or Bill Clinton or anybody just because there\u2019s some overlap between those criticisms and the criticisms that traditionally were directed against those who were trying to bring about greater equality for African-Americans. The flip side is I think it\u2019s important for conservatives to recognize and answer some of the problems that are posed by that history, so that they understand if I am concerned about leaving it up to states to expand Medicaid that it may not simply be because I am this power-hungry guy in Washington who wants to crush states\u2019 rights but, rather, because we are one country and I think it is going to be important for the entire country to make sure that poor folks in Mississippi and not just Massachusetts are healthy.\u201d\n\nSome folks will probably accuse Obama of hinting GOP governors are opting out of the Medicaid expansion for racial reasons. But it seems to me he\u2019s arguing the opposite. He\u2019s asking liberals to acknowledge that you can make a legitimate states rights argument outside of a racial context, while asking conservatives to understand that an African American president (he doesn\u2019t say this, but the context makes it inescapable) can be pushing a federal solution not to crush states rights, but to help poor people of all different backgrounds who need health care.\n\nIn one sense, there is a racial dimension to the debate over Obamacare and the Medicaid expansion. A recent study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that \u201cpoor uninsured black adults residing in the south\u201d are likely to be disproportionately impacted by the decision of many states not to opt in to the Medicaid expansion, likely leading to \u201cwidening\u201d racial disparities in coverage and access to care.\n\nBut that study also found that some 2.2 million whites fall into the \u201cMedicaid gap,\u201d meaning many poor whites will also be adversely impacted by GOP governors who continue to refuse the Medicaid expansion.\n\nNational Journal recently noted that GOP attacks on the Affordable Care Act, with their focus on those getting \u201cfree health care\u201d thanks to the Medicaid expansion, are akin to the \u201cwelfare queen\u201d attacks, and have taken on an element of \u201cclass warfare\u201d and \u201cracial undertones.\u201d Mitt Romney recently claimed he lost in part because he\u2019d underestimated Obamacare\u2019s appeal to \u201cminority populations.\u201d But if such language about the safety net is meant to rally downscale whites against Dems, it\u2019s also worth noting that many poor whites benefit from things like food stamps and unemployment insurance \u2014 and, yes, the Medicaid expansion in states where it is being implemented. Even in southern states Kentucky and West Virginia.\n\nThe \u201cfree stuff\u201d line complements the states rights argument against Obamacare \u2014 Dems are imposing it on red states in a bid to use federal power and handouts to create an ever-growing moocher class that will ultimately overwhelm the non-takers. I\u2019m not sure Obama has ever addressed this debate in these terms before.\n\n* OBAMACARE DEMAND SURGES IN WEST VIRGINIA: Related to the above: The New York Times has a terrific piece looking at poor and unhealthy West Virginia residents who are finding that the Medicaid expansion is a lifeline. Key nugget:\n\nHere in West Virginia, which has some of the shortest life spans and highest poverty rates in the country, the strength of the demand has surprised officials, with more than 75,000 people enrolling in Medicaid\u2026Waitresses, fast food workers, security guards and cleaners described feeling intense relief that they are now protected from the punishing medical bills that have punched holes in their family budgets.\n\nWe\u2019re seeing something similar in Kentucky, where a Democratic governor has embraced the Medicaid expansion (just as in West Virginia), with the result that poor and unhealthy residents are signing up in droves.\n\n* NEED FOR HEALTH CARE OVERCOMES DISLIKE OF OBAMA: Another key nugget from the above Times piece:\n\nChad Webb, a shy 30-year-old who is enrolling people in Mingo County, said a woman at a recent event used biblical terms to disparage Mr. Obama as an existential threat to the nation. Mr. Webb said he thought to himself: \u201cThis man is not the Antichrist. He just wants you to have health insurance.\u201d Eventually, though, people\u2019s desperate need for insurance seems to be overcoming their distaste for the president.\n\nOf course, this year West Virginia is all but certain to elect the candidate for Senate who would repeal that health insurance\u2026\n\n* IRAN DEAL MOVES FORWARD: Over the weekend, it was announced that Iran took its first concrete steps towards fulfilling its end of the temporary deal curbing its nuclear program in exchange for an easing of some sanctions. Last week it was already clear that the push for a new Iran sanctions bill was losing momentum; news like this could make it easier for Harry Reid to hold off on allowing a vote on such a measure. On the other hand, proponents of the bill will be searching for any sign of the talks going wrong in order to revive it.\n\n* OBAMA WOULD VETO IRAN BILL: One other nugget from Obama\u2019s interview with the New Yorker\u2019s David Remnick has direct bearing on the Iran debate:\n\n\u201cHistorically, there is hostility and suspicion toward Iran, not just among members of Congress but the American people,\u201d Obama said, adding that \u201cmembers of Congress are very attentive to what Israel says on its security issues.\u201d He went on, \u201cI don\u2019t think a new sanctions bill will reach my desk during this period, but, if it did, I would veto it and expect it to be sustained.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery attentive to what Israel says on its security issues\u201d! Points for subtlety. That aside, with 58 co-sponsors, the bill really is within striking distance of a veto override, though Senate Dems really might prove reluctant to take that step in the end.\n\n* SOARING PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT INEQUALITY: A fascinating new Gallup poll finds:\n\nTwo out of three Americans are dissatisfied with the way income and wealth are currently distributed in the U.S. This includes three-fourths of Democrats and 54% of Republicans.\n\nThe finding among Dems is a reminder that Democratic candidates in 2016 will probably have to talk a lot about inequality, and campaign on an ambitious agenda to combat it, given how big a preoccupation it is among Dem voters.\n\n* DISAPPROVAL OF NSA SURVEILLANCE RISES: A new Pew poll finds that Obama\u2019s speech promising reforms to NSA surveillance has not had much of an impact, as disapproval continues to increase:\n\nOverall approval of the program has declined since last summer, when the story first broke based on Edward Snowden\u2019s leaked information. Today, 40% approve of the government\u2019s collection of telephone and internet data as part of anti-terrorism efforts, while 53% disapprove. In July, more Americans approved (50%) than disapproved (44%) of the program. In addition, nearly half (48%) say there are not adequate limits on what telephone and internet data the government can collect.\n\nAlso, while it has often been rightly observed that Dem voters have been more willing to tolerate this sort of overreach under Obama than under Bush, this poll finds, that a majority of them now disapproves.\n\n* AND A COMPROMISE REMAINS POSSIBLE ON IMMIGRATION: With House Republicans set to rollout immigration reform principles that may well include a legalization proposal but no pathway to citizenship, you are likely to see a lot more articles with the framing of this one in the Hill:\n\nCongressional Democrats and advocates for immigration reform will have to decide how much to bend as they await proposals from House Republicans that are likely to fall far short of what they have demanded.\n\nBut this is only half the story. Republicans, too, will have to decide whether they are willing to compromise beyond offering a legalization proposal, by, say, agreeing to steps to clear already existing channels to citizenship.\n\nWhat else?", "article_metadata": {"description": "The president makes striking comments about race and Obamacare.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The president makes striking comments about race and Obamacare.", "title": "The Morning Plum: Obama, race, and the Affordable Care Act", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/01/21/the-morning-plum-obama-race-and-the-affordable-care-act/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/01/20/National-Politics/Images/Obama_NSA_Surveillance-0321c-4442.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/01/21/the-morning-plum-obama-race-and-the-affordable-care-act/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "affordable care act, obamacare, new Yorker, david remnick, barack Obama, immigration reform, inequality, nsa surveillance,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, obamacare, new Yorker, david remnick, barack Obama, immigration reform, inequality, nsa surveillance,"}, "article_summary": "In one sense, there is a racial dimension to the debate over Obamacare and the Medicaid expansion.\nEven in southern states Kentucky and West Virginia.\nBut that study also found that some 2.2 million whites fall into the \u201cMedicaid gap,\u201d meaning many poor whites will also be adversely impacted by GOP governors who continue to refuse the Medicaid expansion.\n* OBAMACARE DEMAND SURGES IN WEST VIRGINIA: Related to the above: The New York Times has a terrific piece looking at poor and unhealthy West Virginia residents who are finding that the Medicaid expansion is a lifeline.\nWe\u2019re seeing something similar in Kentucky, where a Democratic governor has embraced the Medicaid expansion (just as in West Virginia), with the result that poor and unhealthy residents are signing up in droves."}
