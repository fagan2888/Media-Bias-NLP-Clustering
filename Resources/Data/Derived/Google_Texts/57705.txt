While speaking at a Des Moines campaign stop on Friday, Republican candidate Sen. Ted Cruz said that American citizens are “one more liberal justice” away from losing their Second Amendment rights.

“One more liberal justice and our right to keep and bear arms is taken away from us by an activist court,” Cruz responded when asked about how he would handle Supreme Court justices.

“One more liberal justice and they begin sandblasting and bulldozing veterans memorials throughout this country,” Cruz said according to the Des Moines Register. “One more liberal justice and we lose our sovereignty to the United Nations and the World Court.”

Cruz’s comments echo those he made earlier this year following the Supreme Court’s rulings on the Affordable Care Act and same-sex marriage. (VIDEO: Cruz — SCOTS Rulings ‘Some Of The Darkest 24 Hours In Our Nation’s History’)

In the latest Quinnipiac University poll, Cruz is polling in fourth place with 10 percent of the vote. (RELATED: Carson Trumps Trump In New Poll)
