Hope Bowyer was upset during a visit to her son's gravesite Sunday, after seeing someone else had been buried in a plot she said she purchased for herself.

Her 6-year-old son died in a car crash nearly seven years ago.

“We didn't go anywhere without each other. We were always together,” Bowyer said.

And she wanted to keep it that way, in the only way she could. So she bought the plot beside his, so she could be laid to rest next to him at Resthaven Gardens Cemetery.

“The day I bought his, I bought mine,” she said.

She said something had been telling her to visit the site, so on Sunday she went to visit Damien's grave, struggling with the upcoming anniversary of his death and the holidays. She was upset to see fresh soil in a spot she believed was hers, next to Damien.

“No one was supposed to be by him but his mom, the one that took care of him, the one that raised him … no one was ever supposed to be by him but me,” Bowyer said. “It's just something very personal to me, when that's your child.”

Bowyer told News 9 she spoke with management about the issue and didn't get an answer for what had happened.

“I mean it's not just a little error, not at all,” she said.

Bowyer said officials with the cemetery told her it would be addressed on Monday morning, but she didn't think that was soon enough.

“I would just think … if you're the owner, you want to be out here and get this taken care of,” said Bowyer.

Management from Resthaven Gardens Cemetery told News 9 Sunday night that no one is in Bowyer's purchased space and that there will be “ample space" for her burial. They said they will be meeting with the family on Monday to show them how.
