The drill usually calls for the defensive backs to work on footwork and turn as a coach tosses them the ball. Webster, who has been starting at right cornerback while Chris Harris continues to recover from knee surgery, caught it and was tiptoeing near the back of the end zone when his ankle gave way.\n\nAn MRI exam was negative and there is hope Webster will only miss two or three days of practice next week, when the Broncos match up against the Houston Texans.\n\nIn his place, Bradley Roby will start today against the San Francisco 49ers. Nothing against 49ers\u2019 quarterback Colin Kaepernick and his receiver group of Anquan Boldin, Michael Crabtree, Stevie Johnson and Brandon Lloyd. But they can\u2019t be any tougher than going up against Peyton Manning and Demaryius Thomas every day in practice.\n\nWith Aqib Talib starting at left corner, expect Omar Bolden to play some nickel back today.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Bradley Roby,Broncos,cornerbacks,Kayvon Webster,Peyton Manning,San Francisco 49ers", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Bradley Roby will start at cornerback in place of Kayvon Webster, who injured his ankle in camp.", "title": "First-round pick Bradley Roby to replace Kayvon Webster in Broncos vs. 49ers", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/17/first-round-pick-roby-starts-ahead-roby/28821/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/roby-495x317.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Bradley Roby will start at cornerback in place of Kayvon Webster, who injured his ankle in camp.", "creator": "@mikeklis", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/08/17/first-round-pick-roby-starts-ahead-roby/28821/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/08/roby-495x317.jpg", "title": "Bradley Roby, Broncos\u2019 first-round pick, to start ahead of Kayvon Webster vs. 49ers", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Bradley Roby will start at cornerback in place of Kayvon Webster, who injured his ankle in camp."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd023\"", "article_summary": "Broncos cornerbacks were working through a routine ball drill Saturday when Kayvon Webster twisted his ankle.\nIn his place, Bradley Roby will start today against the San Francisco 49ers.\nNothing against 49ers\u2019 quarterback Colin Kaepernick and his receiver group of Anquan Boldin, Michael Crabtree, Stevie Johnson and Brandon Lloyd.\nThe drill usually calls for the defensive backs to work on footwork and turn as a coach tosses them the ball.\nWith Aqib Talib starting at left corner, expect Omar Bolden to play some nickel back today."}
