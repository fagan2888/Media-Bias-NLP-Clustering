The New Year triggered a series of new health-related laws in Florida, including a federal law that encourages schools to stock EpiPens to treat allergic reactions.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services now will reward states with injectable epinephrine laws with grants to buy the medication designed to treat dangerous allergic reactions, the Florida Times-Union reported. Florida passed a law in July that allows public and private schools the right to keep and use EpiPens.

Another new state law gives human trafficking victims the right to have their criminal records expunged, according to the News Service of Florida. The new law applies to those who were forced or coerced to commit crimes such as prostitution.

Also, foster children now have the option of remaining under state care until the age of 21, the News Service of Florida reports. These young adults who had previously “aged out” of the system were found to be at higher risk of being homeless, arrested or out of work.
