As someone living with his two boyfriends in a stable long-term relationship, I would like to know what your stance is on polyamory rights. Is there room for Green support on group civil partnerships or marriages?\n\nBennett replied:\n\nAt present, we do not have a policy on civil partnerships involving more than two people. We are, uniquely in this country, a party whose policies are developed and voted for by our members. We have led the way on many issues related to the liberalisation of legal status in adult consenting relationships, and we are open to further conversation and consultation.\n\nBennett\u2019s comments coincided with oral arguments regarding the constitutionality of same-sex marriage at the Supreme Court last month.\n\nDuring oral arguments last month at the Supreme Court, Justice Samuel Alito expressed concern that permitting same-sex marriages would grant legal precedence for groups of three, four or more.\n\n\u201cA group consisting of two men and two women apply for a marriage license. Would there be any ground for denying them a license?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cWhat would be the ground under the logic of the decision you would like us to hand down in this case? What would be the logic of denying them the same right?\u201d Alito continued.\n\nRyan Anderson, the William E. Simon senior research fellow in religion and a free society at The Heritage Foundation, said that Alito is right to be concerned.\n\n\u201cIf the Supreme Court say \u2018marriage equality\u2019 requires redefining marriage to include same-sex couples, on what basis could the Court deny \u2018marriage equality\u2019 to same-sex throuples? Or opposite-sex quartets?\u201d asked Anderson.\n\nHe continued:", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Green party is \u201copen\u201d to granting legal status to marriages involving more than two people.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Green party is \u201copen\u201d to granting legal status to marriages involving more than two people.", "title": "Green Party of England Leader 'Open' to Polyamorous Marriage", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/508greenUK.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1EQRgQW"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The Green party is \u201copen\u201d to granting legal status to marriages involving more than two people.", "title": "Green Party of England Leader 'Open' to Polyamorous Marriage", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/508greenUK.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Marriage and Family", "published_time": "2015-05-08T11:55:27+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Gay marriage, same sex marriage, Natalie Bennett, Green Party, Samuel Alito, Supreme Court, Supreme Court same-sex marriage"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca358\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf the Supreme Court say \u2018marriage equality\u2019 requires redefining marriage to include same-sex couples, on what basis could the Court deny \u2018marriage equality\u2019 to same-sex throuples?\nNatalie Bennett, the leader of the Green Party of England, recently suggested that her party is \u201copen\u201d to granting legal status to marriages or civil unions involving more than two people.\nBennett\u2019s comments coincided with oral arguments regarding the constitutionality of same-sex marriage at the Supreme Court last month.\nIn a question-and-answer session with readers of PinkNews, which describes itself as \u201cEurope\u2019s largest gay news service,\u201d Bennett said her party is \u201copen to further conversation\u201d on legal status for polyamorous relationships.\nPinkNews reports that a reader asked Bennett:At present those in a \u2018trio\u2019 (a three-way relationship) are denied marriage equality, and as a result face a considerable amount of legal discrimination."}
