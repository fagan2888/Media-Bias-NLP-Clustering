One woman wonders: \u201cI Love Wolf Whistles and Catcalls: Am I a Bad Feminist?\u201d Another asks: \u201cAm I a Bad Feminist Because Sometimes All I Want for My Life is to Get Married, Have Babies and a Nice House Out in the Country?\u201d And: \u201cCan a Beauty Editor Be a Feminist?\u201d Everywhere you turn, there\u2019s an overwrought unburdening by a woman wringing her virtual hands over the prospect of feminist failure \u2014 confiding her self-diagnosed Bad Feminism, unpacking its minutiae, and then ultimately concluding that, damn it, she\u2019ll call herself a feminist if she wants to. Who says we can\u2019t have it all?\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s not surprising that people find themselves so easily tied in ideological knots over feminism, given that it still occupies such a contested place in American culture. Miley Cyrus rushes to proclaim that she\u2019s \u201cone of the biggest feminists in the world,\u201d while Katy Perry and Shailene Woodley blithely disavow the term; meanwhile, right-wingers like Sarah Palin valiantly attempt to co-opt the term for uses the second wave never intended, and the consumer marketplace shills Dove products and Pantene shampoo with watered-down feminist rhetoric about self-acceptance and empowerment. Is it any wonder that many of us aren\u2019t sure where and how the term is rightly applied?\n\n\u201cChoice\u201d feminism started as the belief, coined somewhat peevishly by Linda Hirshman in her 2007 manifesto \u201cGet to Work,\u201d that a woman\u2019s freedom to choose trumps her right to equality. But in the years since \u2014 and thanks to \u201cSex and the City\u2019s \u2018 Charlotte York, who in one memorable episode chanted \u201cI choose my choice!\u201d like a mantra \u2014 it\u2019s devolved into the idea that anything is a feminist choice so long as a feminist chooses it: not just relationships and kids and career but also religion, sex work, dieting, breast implants, stiletto heels, gun ownership, capitalist megalomania. The morass of choice is at the heart of these most recent self-flagellating screeds. And the specter of being a \u201cbad feminist\u201d tends to crop up around the issues that have most confounded choice feminism: marriage, children, beauty standards and the attendant rituals surrounding all three. Debates around changing your name in marriage, for instance, are perennial headline-grabbers, with a staunch defense of both sides erupting periodically in mainstream newspapers and online. Likewise, strenuously argued \u201cHigh heels are feminist!/No, they aren\u2019t!\u201d back-and-forths pop up as regularly as Anthony Weiner dong shots.\n\nBut in a world where we\u2019re all choosing our choices, there seems to be a lot of second-guessing going on. At first, I likened these confessions to a parallel trend, that of the \u201cbad mom\u201d memoirs and essays that regularly circulate through the blogosphere and publishing world. But they\u2019re not the same at all. The performativity of those, at least, has something of a rationale: It\u2019s less about actually being a bad mom than it is about showing that you fancy yourself a cool, nonconformist mom. Trumpeting your feminist infractions, on the other hand: Sure, you\u2019re being honest. But is it an honesty that anyone needs?\n\nIf this were a true revelation about acting against agreed-upon feminist goals, that would be one thing. An essay titled, I don\u2019t know, \u201cAm I a Bad Feminist Because I Picket My Local Planned Parenthood Every Weekend, Yelling \u2018BABY KILLER!\u2019 Repeatedly?\u201d: That would be the work of a bad feminist. She\u2019s actively working to curtail the bodily autonomy of other women. She gets to call herself a bad feminist, because she is. You, the Thought Catalog writer who dreams of being a stay-at-home mother with a country house? You\u2019re just an oversharer.\n\nI would hope that this goes without saying, but in case it doesn\u2019t: None of these writers \u2014 the country-home coveter or the catcall fan or the beauty editor \u2014 are at risk of being drummed out of feminism, greeted at the clubhouse with a \u201cGO HOME, TRAITOR, WE SAW YOU SMILE AT THAT DUDE WHO WHISTLED AT YOU\u201d sign on the door. Because there is no official body. There is no clubhouse. Yes, there are a scant few people out there who have appointed themselves an unofficial feminist police force, patrolling Twitter and Op-Ed columns and jumping at every opportunity to point out how others are Doing Feminism Wrong. But these people are a tiny fraction of a multifaceted, increasingly inclusive movement. To make them the face of feminism is not only counterproductive but also disingenuous.\n\nMuch more often, the people these essays confess to fall into two camps. There are those of us who understand that life as a feminist unfolds as a series of small and large negotiations within a system (let\u2019s call it \u201cpatriarchy\u201d) that\u2019s the only one we\u2019ve ever known. It\u2019s important to be honest about the ways that years and years living within this system has circumscribed women\u2019s lives and labeled their choices and beings as valid and invalid, valuable and worthless, credible and crazy. And it\u2019s just as important to acknowledge that everything from clothing to child-rearing to an appreciation of horror films comes with a series of internal negotiations. In other words, we\u2019re not going to judge you, or at least we\u2019ll try very hard not to judge you.\n\nThe other camp \u2014 and these are often the ones you\u2019ll find commenting on articles and think pieces about feminism, even on this very site \u2014 have no interest in anything other than discrediting the movement. They\u2019ve been the type responsible for the slings and arrows (and loogies and epithets) that feminism has fielded since its inception. These folks? They will judge you. But they\u2019d be judging you whether or not your bold confession that watching \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\u201d makes you feel like less of a feminist. Do you really want to give them specific ammunition?\n\nWhen I got engaged to my husband 13 years ago, a few people asked whether I was going to have a \u201cfeminist\u201d wedding. I answered that, in truth, I felt like the only significant way to impose feminism on a wedding would be to not get married at all. I had my reasons for choosing to go the marriage route, as most self-identified feminists do, but I didn\u2019t feel the need to enumerate them then, and I don\u2019t feel the need to do so now. But I understand why the question was asked, because marriage \u2014 and heterosexual marriage, certainly \u2014 is not a feminist act. Full stop. You can be the feminist-iest feminist around, but your all-male bridesmaids or Wiccan-Unitarian officiant do not, in themselves, have the juice to upend centuries of an institution in whose original incarnation women were just part of a property arrangement that also involved farm animals. It may be a wonderful, unique day for you and your betrothed; in the larger picture, however, your individual choice isn\u2019t remaking that institution in a feminist mold.\n\nBut as feminism has become increasingly individualistic it\u2019s given rise to the belief that one\u2019s personal choices \u2014 where to live, what career to have, what culture to support \u2014 do add up to one\u2019s politics. And weddings are a reliably fraught arena in which feminist identity is often a victim of unreasonably high expectations for subversion. Tracy Clark-Flory wrote a few months ago in Salon about the way her hope of an enlightened entrance into marriage slowly but surely bowed under the weight of the puffy-dress status quo. In \u201cWhere Did My Feminist Wedding Go?\u201d Clark-Flory wrote that \u201cDespite reading every book I possibly could on the tyranny of the wedding industry, I fell victim to it.\u201d At the same time, she assured us that she wasn\u2019t throwing a bouquet, being given away by her father, or changing her last name. Such articles seem to perform a fevered calculus in which everything about weddings \u2014 everything except marriage itself \u2014 is freighted with varying sizes of feminist baggage.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Enough with the dangerous think pieces about whether we can like catcalls or heels or botox and still be feminists", "author": "Andi Zeisler", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Enough with the dangerous think pieces about whether we can like catcalls or heels or botox and still be feminists", "title": "The crisis of \u201cbad feminism\u201d is worse than you think", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/01/the_crisis_of_bad_feminism_is_worse_than_you_think/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/perry_cyrus.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Enough with the dangerous think pieces about whether we can like catcalls or heels or botox and still be feminists", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/perry_cyrus.jpg", "title": "The crisis of \u201cbad feminism\u201d is worse than you think", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The crisis of \u201cbad feminism\u201d is worse than you think", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, bad feminism, catcalls, Editor's Picks, Feminism, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Roxane Gay", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf368\"", "article_summary": "An essay titled, I don\u2019t know, \u201cAm I a Bad Feminist Because I Picket My Local Planned Parenthood Every Weekend, Yelling \u2018BABY KILLER!\u2019 Repeatedly?\u201d: That would be the work of a bad feminist.\nTopics: bad feminism, catcalls, Editor's Picks, Feminism, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, Roxane Gay, Media News, Entertainment NewsLook around the blogosphere, and there seems to be a serious crisis of conscience among feminists \u2014 one that even predates Roxane Gay\u2019s trailblazing new book on the subject.\nAnd the specter of being a \u201cbad feminist\u201d tends to crop up around the issues that have most confounded choice feminism: marriage, children, beauty standards and the attendant rituals surrounding all three.\nShe gets to call herself a bad feminist, because she is.\nWhen I got engaged to my husband 13 years ago, a few people asked whether I was going to have a \u201cfeminist\u201d wedding."}
