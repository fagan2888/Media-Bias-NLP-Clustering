Too Old to Work; Too Broke to Retire

29% of jobseekers 55 and older still seek work one year later

Adobe Stock Photo Top five tips for older workers seeking employment While landing a job at age 55 is statistically less likely than at age 25, steps can be taken to increase the odds in your favor. According to experts at online employment sites CareerBuilder, Monster and Retired Worker, consider these tips when seeking employment:



1. Stash the "red flag"



No need to draw unnecessary attention to yourself by emphasizing graduation dates in a resume. Same thing goes for decades-old employment dates. Go back five to 10 years in detail. Beyond that, simply describe previous jobs by summarizing skills and accomplishments. Historical dates can wait for the interview and job application form.



2. Technology is your friend



Technology isn't going away, even at the check-out line or factory floor. If you aren't comfortable using mobile Apps or computerized spreadsheets, take a short course at the local library or college. Or have a family member walk-you through the basics.



3. Resumes that speak "Read me"



Most employers conduct key word searches of online resumes to pluck-out qualified candidates. Include specific skills (such as "CAD software") and emphasize accomplishments (such as "increased sales 15 percent"). Then post your resume with an online employment site (such as Indeed, which gathers private and public job postings and posts them together on one site).



4. Refresh your look



Employers aren't expecting nor seeking a 55-year-old employee dressed like a 25-year-old. But they are seeking employees who are aware of current trends. If your style hasn't been updated in twenty years, employers may assume your skills haven't, either. Impressions count, so try freshening your appearance with an age-appropriate yet current outfit, haircut and eyewear.



5. Network



Many people are uncomfortable with strangers in their house and employers are no exception. Become a familiar face by volunteering or taking an entry level or temporary position. Have your work portfolio publicly viewable online through sites such as LinkedIn. That way, you can leverage past clients and co-workers as references, as well as sources of unposted job openings.

COTTONWOOD - "Too old to work, too broke to retire" is the nowhere-land occupied by an ever-growing pool of jobseekers.



While federal law prohibits hiring discrimination due to age, employers comparing candidates may silently ask themselves: Do I choose the worker offering 20 years back on my investment or the one offering 5 years? And what about medical issues?



How bad is it?



"In the past, when people over 65 lost their jobs, they were most likely to drop out of the labor force. What was kind of unique about this recession was that workers over 65 still kept looking," reports Richard Johnson of the Urban Institute.



The numbers back that up:



 The average duration of unemployment for jobseekers age 55 years and over was 54 weeks in 2013, according to the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).



 For jobseekers unemployed for one year or more, 29 percent of those age 55 years and older had been out of work for a year or more, compared with 18 percent for those between the ages of 20 and 24, according to the Pew Economic Policy Group Report.



 Over half (57 percent) of workers reported less than $25,000 in total savings and over one-quarter (28 percent) had saved less than $1,000, according to a 2013 survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. It also revealed personal savings have dropped from 10 percent of income in the mid-80s to 2 percent currently.



Too young to retire



Kenneth Moreno of Camp Verde is a fit, energetic 61-year-old. He could pass for being in his 40's.



A debilitating injury cut-short his distinguished law enforcement career. After decades of public service, he sold his home, drove west and now RVs fulltime in the "boondocks."



"I don't like it. I'd rather be working," said Moreno.



But that's a line his injury won't let him to cross.



Far from his East Coast home and family, Moreno keeps occupied by helping his current friends and making new ones. But it frustrates him that his decades of experience and skills hit an untimely brick wall.



"My friends back home say, 'Kenny, you're too young to retire,' but what can I do?" he said.



Too old to work



In his mid-fifties, Raj Kandola of Rimrock is also youthful for his age. But he needs to be spirited, as he works up to 90 hours a week in food service jobs.



"Of course, I'd rather be retired. But I've got to earn a living," he said.



Kandola is a strategist. He realizes how much money is required to survive now and in the future. To make the math work at his age and wage, it all comes down to working the maximum number of hours.



So Kandola takes-on all available shifts and sometimes juggles jobs. He is responsible for paying-into his own retirement and health care.



"This year, I will be penalized if I don't have buy insurance, so I will have to buy Obamacare, too," said Kandola.



Dirty little secret about falling unemployment



While indications are that Arizona is rebounding from recession and that unemployment is down this year, the dirty little secret is that unemployed workers may be falling off the record books.



For example, the October 2015 unemployment rate in Arizona was reported as 6.1 percent, according to the U. S. Department of Labor (DOL). Known as the "U-3" column, it represents workers reporting themselves unemployed within the 26 week window of unemployment benefits.



However, it fails to consider jobseekers whose benefits have expired, jobseekers who are underemployed (settling for part-time jobs) and/or jobseekers who are discouraged from seeking work at all. That number is found in the "U-6" column.



The "U-6" column reported that the Oct. 2015 unemployment rate in Arizona was actually 13.6 percent.



How old is too old?



Even more compelling is the advanced age of people having to return to work. One of the fastest growing segments of jobseekers are people 75 years of age and older.



According to a 2013 report by the AARP (formerly the American Association of Retired Persons), "at ages 55 to 64, about two-thirds of Americans are in the labor force; that is, they are working or looking for work. By ages 70 to 74, that figure falls to less than one in five. Over the past two decades, however, there has been an increase -- in some cases, a sharp increase -- in the labor force participation rates of older age groups, even those aged 75 and older."









The Social Security quandary

COTTONWOOD - On the minds of most workers facing retirement age is the topic of Social Security.



The plan that almost was



While many know that President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) signed the Social Security Act (SSA) of 1935, it was actually based on the Townsend Plan, initiated years before by a Californian physician.



Under the Townsend Plan, the federal government -- not employers or workers -- would pay $200 monthly for workers retiring at age 60. The idea was to create room in the workforce by encouraging early retirement and to provide care for the elderly.



Critics viewed the plan as unsustainable. However, according to the SSA website, FDR was aware of its popularity among voters and wanted to launch a pre-emptive strike before it became law.



FDR's SSA version differed from the Townsend Plan in three ways: 1). Workers received $35 monthly, 2). workers were required to work under the plan to draw from the plan and 3) workers were required to contribute throughout their working lives.



How much longer can Social Security survive?



Now that 80 years have passed since the plan was first enacted, some feel that the SSA is unsustainable.



According to the Social Security Trustee's 2015 Annual Report, the fund will run out of money in 18 years, projecting "depletion of total trust fund reserves in 2034."



This is not alarming to some government officials, who point out the deficit will be made-up by raising the eligible age, reducing benefits and/or raising taxes.



When should I retire?



One of the biggest decisions facing older workers is when to draw Social Security benefits.



Some experts recommend waiting in order to receive the highest-percentage of benefit. Others suggest filing sooner so as to maximize the number of years drawing benefits. Another view is to plan a target date in the middle.



Here's what three different retirement scenarios may look like (assuming an average lifespan of 79 years, as calculated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention):



If you retire at age 62 in 2015, your maximum monthly benefit would be $2,025. After 17 years, you would have drawn $413,100 in Social Security.



If you retire at full retirement age 66 in 2015, your maximum monthly benefit would be $2,663. After 13 years, you would have drawn $415,428 in Social Security.



If you retire at age 70 in 2015, your maximum monthly benefit would be $3,501. After 9 years, you would have drawn $378,108 in Social Security.



Note: Data per the SSA. Benefit amounts and eligible ages have changed in the past and may change again.
