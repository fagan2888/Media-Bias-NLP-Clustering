Wichitans and visitors from out of state alike say the new terminal will really put the city on the map.\n\nKyle Snyder from Southwest Airlines flew in for the event from Dallas. he said the old terminal doesn't match what the city is known for --- being the air capitol of the world.\n\n\"It's 50 years old, the concourses are very narrow, not a lot of options for food and shopping,\" said Snyder.\n\nBut the difference between the terminal built in 1954 and the brand new 2015 design is night and day.\n\n\"I think really the it gets it right,\" said Snyder. It's the right size for the Wichita market.\"\n\nWichitans like Jennifer Allen are excited about the new impression of the city visitors will leave with.\n\n\"I think it's modern and it's just beautiful I think it just makes a good first impression,\" said Allen.\n\nMany are hoping this $200 million dollar terminal and parking garage will draw in new businesses and young professionals to the area. The kicker? Taxpayers didn't fork over a dime.\n\n\"Listen very very closely there were no local tax payers used to fund the development or operation of this facility,\" said Brewer.\n\nWichita City Airports Manager Victor White said it was all paid for by airport user fees and revenue.\n\nThe upgrade will give the community a new sense of pride and leave visitors with a lasting memory of what Wichita is all about.\n\n\"Their perception upon visiting this airport is that this is a very progressive city and that this is the air capitol and we need to demonstrate that,\" said Allen.\n\nThe dedication party came with a big price tag of $150,000, but city managers say none of that came from taxpayers. White said it was covered by sponsorships, donations and ticket sales.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Wichitans and visitors from out of state alike say the new terminal will really put the city on the map.", "language": "english", "author": "Ben Jordan", "og": {"description": "Wichitans and visitors from out of state alike say the new terminal will really put the city on the map.", "title": "Gala attendees say Wichita airport's new terminal will change visitor perception", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Gala-attendees-say-New-Eisenhower-National-Airport-terminal-will-change-visitor-perception-of-Wichita--299475061.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/884/22D/88422D5BDA1E48738F4AD54E06AB5444", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/BD1/5D4/BD15D4C12BB54B89A1D567B6E0521E83.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.kake.com", "description": "Wichitans and visitors from out of state alike say the new terminal will really put the city on the map.", "title": "Gala attendees say Wichita airport's new terminal will change visitor perception", "url": "http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/Gala-attendees-say-New-Eisenhower-National-Airport-terminal-will-change-visitor-perception-of-Wichita--299475061.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/eisenhower+airport+gala.jpg", "creator": "@KAKEnews", "site": "@KAKEnews", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Gala attendees say Wichita airport's new terminal will change visitor perception", "google-site-verification": "H0mev8O__gMqb34WcvOyZgBXFMRQZvDAQ0YTSGJ9hGQ", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Gala attendees say Wichita airports, new terminal will change visitor"}, "article_summary": "Wichita City Airports Manager Victor White said it was all paid for by airport user fees and revenue.\nWichitans like Jennifer Allen are excited about the new impression of the city visitors will leave with.\nWichitans and visitors from out of state alike say the new terminal will really put the city on the map.\nThe dedication party came with a big price tag of $150,000, but city managers say none of that came from taxpayers.\nhe said the old terminal doesn't match what the city is known for --- being the air capitol of the world."}
