According to the Swedish edition of The Local, an English-language European news site, hundreds of thousands of Swedes, nominally entitled to \u201cfree\u201d taxpayer-funded healthcare, are opting to pay extra for private health insurance in an effort to obtain the speedy, high-quality care they are being denied by the public system.\n\nThe exact number of Swedes covered by private insurance is a bit difficult to ascertain, but it is at least half a million and possibly close to one million \u2014 and growing rapidly. This is a significant number in a country of around 9.6 million people, roughly as many as the Chicago metro area. In 2011, The Local reported that \u201cprivate healthcare insurance plans have grown a whopping 400 percent in a decade.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is happy with this development, of course. Eva-Lisa Krabbe of the Swedish Association of Health Professionals, a union for Swedish healthcare workers, told The Local, \u201cWe think healthcare should be available through the public system. If we have a public system that covers people\u2019s needs, there\u2019s no need for insurance.\u201d\n\nBut that is precisely the point: The public system isn\u2019t covering people\u2019s needs, and so they are willing to shell out the extra cash \u2014 a standard policy costs about $624 a year, insurance executive Kent Andersson told The Local \u2014 on top of the taxes they are already paying for healthcare.\n\n\u201cLong queues are one of the main complaints for consumers of Sweden\u2019s public healthcare services, with patients sometimes forced to wait as much as fifteen times longer for treatment compared to private options,\u201d The Local observed, noting in another article that \u201cvisitors are sometimes surprised to learn about year-long waiting times for cancer patients.\u201d\n\nJust how bad is it? In a July 2013 article for the Ludwig von Mises Institute, native Swede Klaus Bernpainter recalled:\n\nFor non-emergency cases in Sweden, you must go to the public \u201cHealthcare Central.\u201d This is always the starting point for anything from the common flu to brain tumors. You must go to your assigned Central, according to your healthcare district. Admission is by appointment only. Usually they have a 30-minute window every morning, when you call to claim one of the budgeted slots. Make sure to call early or they run out. Rarely will you get an appointment for the same day. You will be assigned a general practitioner, probably one you have never met before; likely one who does not speak fluent Swedish; and very likely one who hates his job. If you have a serious condition, you will be started on a path of referrals to experts. This process can take months....\n\nThis healthcare \u201cbread line\u201d is where people die. It happens regularly that by the time a patient gets to see an expert, his condition has progressed beyond remedy. It also happens frequently that referrals get lost....\n\nThe emergency room is a different experience altogether. Unless you are suffocating or are hemorrhaging profusely, you should expect to wait 5-7 hours to see a doctor. You can only hope for this \u201chigh\u201d level of service if you arrive on a workday and during office hours. After hours, or on weekends, it is worse. Doctors are mostly busy filling out forms for the central health care authorities, scribbling codes in little boxes to report services rendered, instead of seeing patients. There have been cases reported where patients have seen a doctor immediately, but such cases are rare.\n\nIt is important to plan any major health problems you intend to have outside of June, July, and August, because during the summer months, hospitals are virtually shut down for vacation.\n\nIn 2007 the Swedish government established a \u201cHealthcare Guarantee\u201d under which patients are supposed to receive treatment within established timeframes. These standards should hardly be difficult to achieve \u2014 a patient, e.g., should be able to see his primary care physician within one week \u2014 yet even such modest goals are going unmet.\n\n\u201cThe Healthcare Guarantee isn\u2019t a guarantee,\u201d Andersson told The Local. \u201cIf you don\u2019t receive care within the promised time, there are no sanctions, and you don\u2019t get any compensation.\u201d\n\nPrivate insurers, meanwhile, are writing such guarantees into their policies and enforcing them. \u201cInsurance company IF, for example, offers insurance policies which guarantee specialist care within two days, while patients can wait at least a month to see a specialist in the public system,\u201d said The Local.\n\nBesides the wait times, there is the inevitable poor care, the result of a lack of a profit motive for healthcare providers and the rationing of care by bureaucrats. According to Bernpainter, \u201cevery year more conditions are classified as non-life-threatening, and are therefore no longer covered.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was recently revealed in one of the major newspapers that doctors were told to prioritize patients based on their value as future taxpayers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOld people naturally have a low future-taxpayer-value, so they naturally became low priority in the machine and less likely to receive proper treatment.\u201d\n\nIt is no surprise, therefore, that about 3,000 Swedes die each year from medical malpractice. An article in a Swedish newspaper \u201chighlight[ed] several recent cases, including the death of an infant to an overdose of painkillers, two elderly patients who died after their blood poisoning was misdiagnosed as the stomach flu, as well as the case of ambulance drivers who took a lunch break instead of responding to a call,\u201d The Local reported in 2011. Since these deaths are occurring within a state-run healthcare system, \u201cindividual cases rarely lead to any widespread debate about patient safety because it takes so long for the National Board of Health and Welfare ... to process the cases.\u201d\n\nEighty percent of Swedes with private insurance are obtaining it through their employers, which means they are still paying for it indirectly via lower wages, a tradeoff they appear willing to make for the sake of their health.\n\nEmployers, too, have a strong incentive to get their employees out of the government system, penned The Local: \u201c\u2018It\u2019s quicker to get a colleague back to work if you have an operation in two weeks\u2019 time rather than having to wait for a year,\u2019 privately insured Anna Norlander told Sveriges Radio.... \u2018It\u2019s terrible that I, as a young person, don\u2019t feel I can trust the health care system to take care of me.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf course, in Sweden, as in the United States, one thing remains constant: The politicians refuse to subject themselves to the same laws to which they subject everyone else. In Sweden, wrote Bernpainter, \u201cthe politicians have private health care, though, naturally paid for by taxpayers.\u201d In America, Congress exempts itself from ObamaCare.\n\nAt least the Swedes, however, have the option to escape their government\u2019s healthcare system. Americans, alas, have no such choice as long as ObamaCare remains on the books.\n\nPhoto of Stockholm, Sweden", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Sweden, healthcare, health insurance, ObamaCare, public system, private insurance", "og": {"url": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/europe/item/17472-swedes-choose-private-insurance-over-socialized-medicine", "image": "http://www.thenewamerican.com/media/k2/items/cache/baeb48f3f8ff4b600577e92d3e6145b9_XL.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Hundreds of thousands of Swedes are buying private health insurance to escape the slow, poor-quality care of their government healthcare.
