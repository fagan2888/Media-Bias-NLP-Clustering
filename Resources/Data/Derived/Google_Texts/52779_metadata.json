Presbyterian\u2019s numbers spiked by 13,000 patients, according to its spokesperson.\n\n\u201cOur wait times initially have gone up, but we are increasing our staffing and working on handling that additional patient load,\u201d said Disney.\n\nWait times at Lovelace Women\u2019s are back down to about 30 minutes, about the same as the year before. Presbyterian said its wait times increased from an average of 57 minutes to 75 minutes.\n\nUniversity of New Mexico Hospital did not respond to a request for its emergency room visits or wait times.\n\nDisney said there are certain things that always warrant a trip to the ER, including chest pain, shortness of breath, heavy bleeding, and stroke symptoms such as numbness, tingling and slurred speech. But in other cases, people may be better off going to a regular doctor or urgent care.\n\nWhen it comes to children, people should do everything they can to go to their pediatrician first, but if that\u2019s not possible, the ER may have to be a last resort.\n\n\u201cWhen they're conditions that are worrisome to the parents, they should not hesitate to bring their child to the emergency room to be evaluated,\u201d said Disney.", "article_metadata": {"category": "New Mexico News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 08 Feb 2016 19:52:17 MST", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Sandra Ramirez", "og": {"site_name": "KOAT", "description": "With more people insured under the Affordable Care Act, citizens might find it harder to get in to see their doctor -- and that has more people making a visit to the emergency room.", "title": "Area hospitals see spike in ER visits, wait times", "url": "http://www.koat.com/news/area-hospitals-see-spike-in-er-visits-wait-times/37890984", "image": "http://www.koat.com/image/view/-/37891068/medRes/2/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/14160g1/-/img-ER-wait-times.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.koat.com/news/area-hospitals-see-spike-in-er-visits-wait-times/37890984", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "koat://content/article/37890984", "iphone": "koat://content/article/37890984", "googleplay": "koat://content/article/37890984"}, "name": {"ipad": "koat", "iphone": "koat", "googleplay": "koat"}, "id": {"ipad": 505246892, "iphone": 505246892, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.koat"}}, "site": "@KOATLiveUpdates", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "koat://content/article/37890984", "app_name": "koat", "package": "com.hearst.android.koat"}, "ios": {"url": "koat://content/article/37890984", "app_store_id": 505246892, "app_name": "koat"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 141082827976}, "google-site-verification": "UP7Vu_zgjLycilR22TycHT_yNOXa0R6ziN6WRB9F3rw", "keywords": "local albuquerque news, breaking albuquerque news, live albuquerque alerts, local new mexico news", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/sandraramireznc9?fref=ts"}, "news_keywords": "local albuquerque news, breaking albuquerque news, live albuquerque alerts, local new mexico news", "description": "With more people insured under the Affordable Care Act, citizens might find it harder to get in to see their doctor -- and that has more people making a visit to the emergency room."}, "article_summary": "University of New Mexico Hospital did not respond to a request for its emergency room visits or wait times.\n\u201cOur wait times initially have gone up, but we are increasing our staffing and working on handling that additional patient load,\u201d said Disney.\nWait times at Lovelace Women\u2019s are back down to about 30 minutes, about the same as the year before.\n\u201cOver the last two years, we've seen significant increase in volume,\u201d said Michael Disney, physician medical director at Lovelace Women\u2019s Hospital.\nPresbyterian said its wait times increased from an average of 57 minutes to 75 minutes."}
