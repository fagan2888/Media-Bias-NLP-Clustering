Instead she became the feminist laughing stock. Feminists at ThinkProgress and Reality Check are accusing her of \u201cintersectionality failure\u201d and \u201cstructural erasure\u201d (seriously! I\u2019m not making this up) \u2014 which are just fancy ways of saying that she upset their oppression scorecard.\n\nHer comments, especially that women deserve wage equality with men because they give \"birth to every taxpayer and citizen of this nation,\u201d were genuinely weird. But they were not her fault, I note in my column at The Week.
