NEW YORK (AP) â€” Is it a dime? Or is it a nail?

In probably one of the oddest items to come to the world of coin collecting, New York-based Heritage Auctions has announced the sale of a Roosevelt dime that was accidentally (or some say deliberately) struck onto a zinc nail.

In its history, the U.S. Mint has made more than a few errors. There were Lincoln pennies that were struck onto the material for a dime, Washington quarters struck more than once and wrong dates on coins. Most errors are caught by the Mint, but occasionally a few make it out into circulation. Those coins are sought out by collectors.

The dime/nail is estimated to be worth roughly $10,000. The auction is scheduled for Jan. 6 in Tampa, Florida.
