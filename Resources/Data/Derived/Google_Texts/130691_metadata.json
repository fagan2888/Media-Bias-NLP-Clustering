You\u2019re perhaps not alone. The drink was first served in 2011 at the stakes, the third and last leg of the Triple Crown held annually at Belmont, on Long Island near the New York City border. But it hasn\u2019t quite gotten the same buzz as the mint julep. And it\u2019s not even the first Belmont-themed cocktail that race organizers have introduced to woo the racing public, to no avail. Previous mixology misfires include the Belmont breeze and the white carnation.\n\nBut with a sold-out crowd of 90,000 on hand for Saturday\u2019s Belmont Stakes, drawn in large part by the prospect of seeing American Pharoah become the first horse to win the Triple Crown in more than 30 years, there\u2019s talk that the drink may have found its thirsty fan base. Race officials say they\u2019re prepared to sell 7,500 commemorative drink-filled glasses at $20 a pop (you can have the drink in a nondescript plastic cup for a few bucks less). In 2014, some 5,000 commemorative glasses were sold.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve put a great deal of effort into promoting the cocktail,\u201d said Peter Matra, a vice president of Centerplate, Belmont\u2019s food and drink service.\n\nSo, what goes into a Belmont jewel? The drink is a fairly straightforward mix of Knob Creek bourbon, lemonade and a splash of pomegranate juice. \u201cIt\u2019s like a strong version of a whiskey sour,\u201d said Vinny Ledonne, a Belmont bartender. Ledonne added that the commemorative glass, which lists all previous winners of the 148-year-old race, seems to be the key to the drink\u2019s growing popularity. \u201cThere are people ordering four or five drinks\u201d just for the keepsake aspect, said Ledonne.\n\nStill, not everyone appeared to be sold. Belmont attendees seemed to be far more likely to have a brew in hand than a Belmont jewel. \u201cI associate sports with beer,\u201d said Henry Austin, 22, a horse racing fan from Rhode Island who was enjoying a can of Heineken as he settled in for the day of racing.\n\nOf course, if the Belmont jewel fails to catch on, Belmont officials may have a different sort of culinary card to play. In addition to promoting the cocktail, they\u2019re also pushing a signature Belmont burger that\u2019s topped with pastrami, that classic New York deli favorite.\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"domain": "marketwatch.com", "description": "There may be no cocktail that\u2019s more associated with horse racing than the Mint Julep, the bourbon-based sip traditionally served at the Kentucky Derby, the first leg of the famed Triple Crown.
