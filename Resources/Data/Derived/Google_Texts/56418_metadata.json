Though he claims to be \u201ctotally in favor of vaccines,\u201d Trump also stated that from his own personal experience, vaccinations can lead to autism.\n\nHe describes instances of autism as \u201can epidemic\u201d that has become \u201cout of control,\u201d crediting the high doses of vaccinations that we give to children as the culprit. \u201cYou take a baby in\u2026you take this little beautiful baby and you pump it with what looks like it\u2019s meant for a horse, not a child,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople that work for me, just the other day, 2-year-old, 2-and-a-half-year-old, beautiful child, they went to have a vaccine and came back and a week later they got a tremendous fever, got very sick, and now is autistic.\u201d\n\nAdding to this, Trump said that for his own children, he chose to spread out vaccinations so that they weren\u2019t getting such high doses all at once. Dr. Ben Carson, a former pediatric neurosurgeon, rebutted Trump\u2019s claim by saying that \u201cextremely well documented proof\u201d exists refuting claims that vaccination can in any way cause autism.\n\nAnd while Trump may be trying on many different hats lately, he may want to stay away from doctoring. A 2014 study published in the journal Vaccine added to an overwhelming body of evidence by examining many studies that have analyzed the link between autism and vaccination. A total of 1,256,407 children were involved in these studies, along with 9,920 children evaluated from five case-control studies; ultimately, the researchers found no evidence for vaccinations causing autism spectrum disorders, nor was their evidence that the chemical thimerosal found in vaccinations, or mercury was to blame for ASD.\n\nMany people cite a 1998 study published in the journal Lancet as the start of the association between vaccinations and autism, but that study was found to be highly flawed; not only was it not based in statistics, it did not involve a control group, it relied too heavily on memory and it made vague conclusions proven to not be statistically valid.\n\nTo counter Trump\u2019s claim that his employee's baby developed autism shortly after receiving a vaccination, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notes that many children start to show signs of autism around the time vaccinations are required. They also note that the risk of remaining unvaccinated, or prolonging becoming fully vaccinated has more risks than benefits. Young children left unvaccinated are more vulnerable to developing preventable diseases that could lead to hospitalizations, disability, and even death. Delaying vaccinations also inhibits herd immunity, a phenomenon known to keep those too young to receive their shots from developing these diseases as well.\n\nSource: Taylor L, Swerdfeger A, Eslick G.
