SAN DIEGO (AP) — Authorities say an ultralight aircraft carrying about 250 pounds of marijuana has crashed in the mountains east of San Diego, but there’s no sign of the pilot.

The downed plane was discovered Friday morning by U.S. Customs and Border Protection during a routine air patrol.

A team of federal agents picking through the wreckage in the remote Laguna Mountains found a helmet, gloves and other gear. There was also a pair of footprints leading away from the crash site.

Because there was no sign of blood, authorities believe the pilot walked away unscathed.

The marijuana was removed from the craft.

Mike Carney of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement says agents are pursuing all leads related to the drug-smuggling incident.
