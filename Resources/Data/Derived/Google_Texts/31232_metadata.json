That determination then, essentially, if it was accepted by a court, would forbid abortions to take place. I mean, it \u2013 it would essentially bar abortions, because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child, and if this is a child, then this would be an antiabortion statute.\n\nSimilarly, while running for the U.S. Senate in 2003, Obama emphatically stated at a press conference, \u201cI am pro-choice.\u201d Asked by a reporter if that applied \u201cin all situations including the late term thing,\u201d he repeated, \u201cI am pro-choice. I believe that women make responsible choices and they know better than anybody the tragedy of a difficult pregnancy and I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s the government\u2019s role to meddle in that choice.\u201d\n\nOn the occasion of the 100th anniversary of CHA, Obama was invited by the organization\u2019s CEO and president, Sister Carol Keehan, to provide the keynote address at Tuesday\u2019s event.\n\nAs Joan Desmond reports at National Catholic Register, the appearance of Obama with Keehan and her group \u201cboldly signaled the enduring intertwined interests of a political leader and an industry lobbyist.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been my privilege to work with the president and his team over the past seven years,\u201d Keehan said as she introduced Obama to the conference assembly, which was also attended by HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell and several members of Congress. \u201cWith CHA\u2019s deep gratitude for his leadership and concern for the well-being of all Americans, it is my honor and pleasure now to introduce the president of the United States, Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nKeehan, a defiant member of the institutional Catholic left, broke with the U.S. Catholic bishops when it became clear the Obama administration would expand abortion through Obamacare and require free contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs to be provided to employees of many Catholic organizations and schools through health insurance plans. In return for her support and the appearance of \u201cCatholic\u201d endorsement of Obamacare, the president presented Keehan with one of the 21 ceremonial pens he used to sign the health care reform into law.\n\nLater, when the bishops rejected the Obama administration\u2019s \u201cshell games,\u201d aka \u201caccommodations,\u201d that were claimed to solve their ethical dilemmas with the HHS contraception mandate, Keehan once again provided Catholic \u201ccover\u201d for Obama, splitting with the bishops and announcing, \u201cWe are pleased that our members now have an accommodation that will not require them to contract, provide, pay or refer for contraceptive coverage.\u201d\n\nAs Catholic News Agency reported in 2010, the late Cardinal Francis George, former archbishop of Chicago, said of Keehan, \u201cSister Carol and her colleagues are to blame\u201d for the passage of the health care bill.\n\nKeehan\u2019s assistance to Obama has continued even to this year, when CHA filed an amicus brief that urged the Supreme Court to rule in the White House\u2019s favor regarding eligibility for subsidies for Obamacare in every state of the country.\n\nIn a video during a press conference on Capitol Hill, Keehan said that with Obamacare, \u201cour nation took a giant step forward. And now if this case is decided wrongly, we\u2019ll take a giant step back.\u201d\n\n\u201cSister Carol\u2019s public support for the president in this matter, and his appearance at the CHA event suggest that her standing as a religious sister will once again be used to leverage political support for the president,\u201d writes Desmond. \u201cAnd, in this case, it sent the message that there will be hell to pay if the high court, specifically the four Catholic justices on the conservative wing, rule against the White House.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just love nuns, generally,\u201d said Obama during his CHA address. \u201cWe would not have gotten the Affordable Care Act one had it not been for [Sister Carol Keehan].\u201d\n\nThe CHA event afforded Obama an opportunity to pump up his signature health care law as the nation waits for another Supreme Court ruling that could affect its viability.\n\nFrom the White House transcript of Obama\u2019s remarks:\n\nNearly one in three uninsured Americans have already been covered \u2014 more than 16 million people -\u2013 driving our uninsured rate to its lowest level ever. (Applause.) Ever. On top of that, tens of millions more enjoy new protections with the coverage that they\u2019ve already got. That 85 percent who had health insurance, they may not know that they\u2019ve got a better deal now than they did, but they do. Americans can no longer be denied coverage because of preexisting conditions \u2014 from you having had cancer to you having had a baby. Women can\u2019t be charged more just for being a woman. (Applause.) And they get free preventive services like mammograms. And there are no more annual or lifetime caps on the care patients receive.\n\nCastigating his critics, Obama continued:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama To Catholic Health Association: \u2018Every Human Being, Made in the Image of God, Deserves to Live in Dignity\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Obama To Catholic Health Association: \u2018Every Human Being, Made in the Image of God, Deserves to Live in Dignity\u2019", "title": "Obama To Catholic Health Association: \u2018Every Human Being, Made in the Image of God, Deserves to Live in Dignity\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Obama-CHA.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/11/obama-to-catholic-health-association-every-human-being-made-in-the-image-of-god-deserves-to-live-in-dignity/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Obama To Catholic Health Association: \u2018Every Human Being, Made in the Image of God, Deserves to Live in Dignity\u2019", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/06/Obama-CHA.jpg", "title": "Obama To Catholic Health Association: \u2018Every Human Being, Made in the Image of God, Deserves to Live in Dignity\u2019 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Abortion, Catholic Bishops, Catholic Health Association, contraceptives, HHS mandate, late-term abortion, obamacare, partial birth abortion, Secretary Sylvia Burwell, Sister Carol Keehan,Big Government, Medicine, Obama,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Sister Carol Keehan", "published_time": "2015-06-11T05:43:14-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obama,Medicine"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd99ef\"", "article_summary": "In return for her support and the appearance of \u201cCatholic\u201d endorsement of Obamacare, the president presented Keehan with one of the 21 ceremonial pens he used to sign the health care reform into law.\nThat determination then, essentially, if it was accepted by a court, would forbid abortions to take place.\nThat 85 percent who had health insurance, they may not know that they\u2019ve got a better deal now than they did, but they do.\nIn a video during a press conference on Capitol Hill, Keehan said that with Obamacare, \u201cour nation took a giant step forward.\nOn top of that, tens of millions more enjoy new protections with the coverage that they\u2019ve already got."}
