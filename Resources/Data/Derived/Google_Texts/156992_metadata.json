I put my hijab on, bundled up my 1-year-old toddler and stood with the other parents outside the brown brick building on that chilly afternoon. I noticed that no one was making eye contact with me as they talked about the news. It was the beginning of the school year, we hadn\u2019t had the time to get to know each other and now I was too shattered with anxiety for small talk. As soon as I got home I called the elementary school where both my daughters were blithely running around during recess. I needed to know they were safe.\n\nThat evening I watched all four of our children eating and playing. \u201cWe\u2019re all toast,\u201d I said to my husband. As far as I was concerned, the End of Days had arrived for us. \u201cYou\u2019re being dramatic,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople know us.\u201d\n\nDid they?\n\nAlthough my parents were from Pakistan, I grew up in the West. And like most people, my social circle tended to resemble people like myself. There\u2019s comfort in the familiar. But after 9/11, I realized just how important it was to break that habit.\n\n\u201cYou never come to my school?\u201d whined my 7-year-old daughter. As a mother of four young children under the age of 7, I hardly had time to eat or bathe. There were days when my mental state was precarious at best. But there was a nagging voice that said if I wanted to be part of a world where my children weren\u2019t seen as the \u201cscary other,\u201d I had to make time.\n\nIt was Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting. I went to my daughter\u2019s first grade class and read from a book, \u201cZaki\u2019s Ramadan Fast,\u201d about what that experience was like for Muslim kids and families. And then I pulled out a bag of Kinder eggs for all my daughter\u2019s classmates. I\u2019d tell them to hold on to them until sunset to see if they could put off eating something they really wanted.\n\n\u201cThey eat them as soon as you leave, you know,\u201d said my outraged daughter. For her it was a matter of principle, for me it was being an ordinary mother to my daughter\u2019s friends. I went every year to a different child\u2019s classroom and soon became that lady with the eggs. As kids transition into high school, parents transition into kryptonite if you come near them in school. So I came up with another way to include their friends into our lives.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I started small, with visits to my kid's classroom to talk about Muslim kids and fasting\u2014that grew into a tradition", "title": "Raising Muslim kids in a climate of hate and fear: This is how our family has fought Islamophobia since 9/11", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "I started small, with visits to my kid's classroom to talk about Muslim kids and fasting\u2014that grew into a tradition", "title": "Raising Muslim kids in a climate of hate and fear: This is how our family has fought Islamophobia since 9/11", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/13/raising_muslim_kids_in_a_climate_of_hate_and_fear_this_is_how_our_family_has_fought_islamophobia_since_911/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/baklava.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "I started small, with visits to my kid's classroom to talk about Muslim kids and fasting\u2014that grew into a tradition", "title": "Raising Muslim kids in a climate of hate and fear: This is how our family has fought Islamophobia since 9/11", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/baklava.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Zarqa Nawaz", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 9/11, Eid-ul-Fitr, Islam, Islamophobia, Muslims, Parenting, Ramadan", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "As kids transition into high school, parents transition into kryptonite if you come near them in school.\nAs soon as I got home I called the elementary school where both my daughters were blithely running around during recess.\nI went to my daughter\u2019s first grade class and read from a book, \u201cZaki\u2019s Ramadan Fast,\u201d about what that experience was like for Muslim kids and families.\nI went every year to a different child\u2019s classroom and soon became that lady with the eggs.\nAs a mother of four young children under the age of 7, I hardly had time to eat or bathe."}
