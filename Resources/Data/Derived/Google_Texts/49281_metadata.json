The U.S. continues to experience residual effects of 2008\u2019s economic crisis, but DreamWorks Animation thrives due to its employee retention strategy. DreamWorks Animation takes perks and employee benefits to another level, one that allows the company to retain employees and revenue. It is a strategy that makes them the prime model for exceptional management.\n\nIn Hollywood, as industry wide DVD sales declined, Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc., Paramount Pictures, and Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. made employee cuts. DreamWorks Animation tried a difference strategy. They avoided layoffs at all costs. The promise to secure every employee\u2019s job was kept in spite of stock fluctuations. DreamWorks\u2019s stock relies on two to three theatrical releases a year.\n\nDreamWorks has cultivated 27 animated feature films including Shrek and How to Train Your Dragon among many others. Named one of the \u201c100 Best Companies to Work For\u201d by Fortune Magazine for five consecutive years, DreamWorks Animation ranked #12 in 2013. This can be attributed to willingness to take risks. When employees make mistakes, the company shows support. Providing job security (as opposed to verbal and written warnings) pushes the boundaries of creativity, according to Dan Satterthwaite, head of human resources since 2007.\n\nDreamWorks Animation ranks in Great Place To Work Institute\u2019s top tier with its 97 percent retention rate. Great Place to Work Institute\u2013a human resources consulting, research, and training firm\u2013studies strengths of successful businesses and recreates models of organizational trust to replicate similar achievements in other companies. Establishing trust inspires high performance of employees and incites employers to allow for innovation. A sense of camaraderie results and increased productivity follows.\n\nKathy Altieri, a production designer at DreamWorks, gives her artists leverage to fail. She believes in giving little instruction, allowing the artists to instead reach for their best selves. Altieri says they rarely fail. On all levels, DreamWorks Animation staff works as team and consider the risk well worth it.\n\nIn addition to risk-taking, DreamWorks\u2019s strategy is to foster spontaneous discussions, openly discuss mistakes, share successes, and nurture professional development. Satterthwaite reveres Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who engages 2,100 employees with daily emails updates of who he is meeting and the conversations he is having. The email creates a sense of transparency and evokes conversation as it engages thousands who spend a significant amount of their time in front of computers.\n\nUnbridled communication and sense of transparency emboldens employees to pitch ideas for movie plots and technology alike. Encouraged to be their own CEOs, pitches are welcomed outside of meeting room. In fact, ideas can be explored while at one of the many facilities DreamWorks offers their employees.\n\nThe DreamWorks campus offers employees amenities such as yoga, kickboxing, and movie screenings. As a part of its main campus, the company provides additional perks such as a doctor\u2019s office and cafeteria serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner at no cost; that is when employees are not seeking snacks from one of the fully stocked kitchens located on every floor of the building.\n\nMany companies struggle to incite their employees to participate in extracurricular activities on their behalf. However, DreamWorks employees team up for countless efforts such as Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Triathlon, AIDS Project LA Walk, and Salvation Army\u2019s Project Angel Tree.\n\nDreamWorks Animation\u2019s risk-taking and trust-cultivating strategies make the company the ideal model to follow. Upcoming projects include The Penguins of Madagascar, which is scheduled to premiere November. 26, 2014, along with 2015\u2019s Home, B.O.O.: Bureau of Otherworldly Operations, and Kung Fu Panda 3. Expect more to come as long as the team works at DreamWorks Animation.\n\nBy Charice Long\n\nSources:\n\nWorkforce\n\nGreat Place to Work\n\nSociety for Human Resource Management\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "DreamWorks Animation proves that team work makes the dream work.
