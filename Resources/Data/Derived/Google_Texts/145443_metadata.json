Another problem, one that hasn\u2019t received enough attention, is that the website is so damn difficult to maneuver that even millennials, young people who\u2019ve grown up in the digital age, can\u2019t figure it out:\n\nA team of doctors, lawyers, health economists and health policy experts from the University of Pennsylvania recruited 33 volunteers and observed them as they struggled to sign up for health insurance on the highly touted website. These volunteers should have been in pretty good shape: With ages ranging from 19 to 30, they were all members of a Web-savvy generation. In addition, the study described the young adults as \u201chighly educated.\u201d But when they got to HealthCare.gov, they ran into problems. Some of them had anticipated that they could type in their preferences \u2013 what services they wanted to have covered, how much they wanted to spend on premiums, how much flexibility they want in picking their doctors \u2013 and get a list of options that met their criteria. (It could have been the health insurance equivalent of using Yelp to find a sushi bar near Santa Monica that has outdoor seating and takes reservations.) Instead, the volunteers had trouble matching their preferences with actual plans, according to the study. The research team said this was partly because of the \u201coverwhelming\u201d amount of information the website displayed. As one of the volunteers told the study authors: \u201cI would love a tool where it\u2019s, like, is it important that you have dental coverage? Check this box. Do you want mental health coverage? Check this box\u2026. [A]nd then have it generate: These are the plans that most closely meet your needs.\u201d\n\nOne of the volunteers said that \u201c[i]t\u2019d be nice if they had something like they do on TurboTax.\u201d Think about that for a moment. TurboTax is a program used to simply the tax filing process, comply with a complicated tax code and litany of IRS regulations. And yet, that\u2019s easier to manage than HealthCare.gov.\n\nAnother problem that the study reveals deals with the nature of health insurance coverage mandates, a problem that has been amplified by Obamacare. Simply put, the Obama administration\u2019s approach to coverage isn\u2019t about what consumers want or need, it\u2019s about the coverage bureaucrats believe they should be required to have.\n\nA volunteer mentioned mental health coverage. Maybe he wanted it, maybe not. But regardless of what he wants it\u2019s one of the 10 so-called \u201cessential health benefits\u201d insurers are required to offer in health plans offered on HealthCare.gov. Worth noting, by the way, that health insurance mandates have roots in politics, not necessarily because they\u2019re good policy.\n\nThese are just a couple of the problems presented by the top-down approach to, what the Obama administration calls, \u201chealthcare reform.\u201d While HealthCare.gov tells a prospective consumer that they can \u201cfind health coverage that works for you,\u201d really they\u2019re more likely to get something dictated to them.\n\nBare in mind that some of these problems were present before Obamacare was passed, but rather than making health coverage more patient-centered, where people can buy the coverage they want, the law has made it to where bureaucrats and special interests have even more of say in the types of coverage available to consumers.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Essential Health Benefits,Health Insurance,health plans,healthcare.gov,insurance mandates,millennials,ObamaCare,Politics,News,Blog,Current,Alternative,Libertarian,Freedom,Election,Nonpartisan,Ron Paul", "DC.Title": "HealthCare.gov is so difficult to use even \"highly educated\" millennials can't figure it out", "robots": "index,follow", "copyright": "(c) 2005-2013 United Liberty", "description": "The epically disastrous rollout of HealthCare.gov, ongoing backend problems and 2.6 million data inconsistencies are just a few parts of the story about the federal Obamacare exchange.
