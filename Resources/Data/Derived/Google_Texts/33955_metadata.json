But little did he know that his education would be accompanied by an unexpected bill for $720 \u2014 in addition to tuition.\n\nMirkss is an international student in film and media. When he came to the U, he accepted a position as a TA, which, he was told, provides him with free student health insurance. Free, however, was a lot more expensive than he thought. When he investigated, he found his school account was on hold because he had failed to take a test that proved his English was good enough to be a teaching assistant.\n\n\u201cThat was quite amusing because I have a bachelor\u2019s degree from an English university, and I\u2019ve spent most of my life in England,\u201d Mirkss said.\n\nMirkss said he was never told he needed to take the test. The International Teaching Assistant Program is responsible for assuring international TAs can speak English proficiently. Misunderstandings like Mirkss\u2019 seem likely \u2014 the process for clearance is listed in a convoluted flow chart on their website.\n\n\u201cNobody has really explained to me why that happened and what happened exactly, so it\u2019s basically just out of nowhere receiving these bills for $720 and being told that you\u2019re not going to go through spring classes,\u201d Mirkss said.\n\nMirkss was born and raised in Latvia and later moved to England. He has been trying for weeks to fix the misunderstanding. He said his department has been helpful in trying to communicate with the international office and the school\u2019s insurance. Still, the problem remains unsolved, and Mirkss remains frustrated.\n\nDiane Cotsonas is the manager of the International Teaching Assistant Program. The department registers and trains hundreds of students and she says it can get \u201cmessy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s respectful communication, we can take care of everything,\u201d Cotsonas said.\n\nThe U automatically enrolls all international students in the school\u2019s health insurance, and the process is not always smooth. With insurance, confusion is understandable. The student health insurance page on the U site has links for three-year-old rates, and two of the links are dead.\n\nUnitedHealth Group, the largest health carrier in the U.S., provides the U\u2019s student health insurance. They list several forms and brochures on their site for U insurance. The policy itself is a hefty 41 pages of charts, medical definitions and coverage details. Many international students have a hard time sorting through the information.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know much about it, just it\u2019s expensive,\u201d said Iljoon Song, a junior in economics.\n\nMany students say that auto-enrollment unfairly traps them with the school\u2019s insurance. The Student Health Center disagrees. It says that while they do auto-enroll all international students, the students are free to use other insurance as long as the student provides proof to the school.\n\nHowever, students say without a social security number the process is lengthy and difficult. Many international students do waive, but for others, the hassle of finding outside insurance while dealing with school is not worth it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly annoying,\u201c said Sara Kang, an undecided sophomore.\n\nHer only source of income is money sent each month from her family in Korea. When she purchases medication, she has to pay the entire cost herself before being reimbursed. Student insurance reimburses 50 percent of prescription drug costs. With limited income, it became extremely difficult for Kang, so she now tries to avoid buying medication as much as possible. She says the whole process is stressful and condescending.\n\n\u201cA person from the health center says \u2018you need it because you don\u2019t know about America,\u2019 but I\u2019m 22 years old, not 22 months. I can take care of myself,\u201d Kang said.\n\nKerry Hill is the Immunization and Student Insurance Program manager at the Student Health Center. She says there\u2019s a good reason for auto-enrolling foreign students.\n\n\u201cThe policies they were buying were really, really bad policies. A lot of them would go home and the hospital was frustrated because they would just leave bills unpaid,\u201d Hill said.\n\nThe U does not track if domestic students are insured because the government does through the Affordable Care Act. The CDC indicates 15.4 percent of adults age 18 to 24 were uninsured at the start of 2015. Many U students are still under their parents\u2019 plan, some purchase their own, and some go without any insurance.\n\nInternational students wish they had more options, but not all think auto-enrollment is a bad idea. Pallavi Aggarwal, a graduate student in computing, says it helps international students.\n\n\u201cPaying for medical stuff becomes very tough. Yes it is expensive, but better than not having it,\u201d Aggarwal said.\n\nAnil Konasale Krishna, a graduate student in computer science, discovered the insurance didn\u2019t cover dental when he had to pay more than $400 to get his wisdom teeth removed. He says the insurance is inconvenient, but the price is good and it is worth having.\n\nStudents continue to debate the U\u2019s policies and cost, but the U has a similar plan to other local institutions. For a single student in fall semester, the U\u2019s plan is $720. SLCC costs $520. Westminster\u2019s plan for domestic students is $927, and $635 for international students. Both institutions auto-enroll all international students.\n\nThe U\u2019s plan has a $250 deductible and pays 80 percent coinsurance for preferred providers. SLCC has no deductible and pays 100 percent coinsurance. Westminster\u2019s plan is similar to the U\u2019s, but also pays 100 percent coinsurance for international students. While the U charges students with student health insurance a $10 co-pay for every visit to the health center, neither SLCC nor Westminster have co-pays for health center visits.\n\nThe U may be more expensive than nearby schools, but the Student Health Center notes that the insurance provides access to the advanced medical facilities across the U\u2019s campus. It says that prices are 30 to 60 percent cheaper than other insurance options.\n\nThere are currently 3,110 students enrolled on the plan \u2014 slightly less than the 3,118 international students at the U last fall \u2014 meaning voluntary enrollment isn\u2019t particularly popular.\n\nm.bateman@utah.edu\n\n@mbatman72\n\n2\n\n0 Shares", "article_metadata": {"description": "Walter Mirkss is a first semester graduate student at the U.
