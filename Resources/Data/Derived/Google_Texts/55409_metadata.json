A number of companies have settled federal whistleblower lawsuits in recent years that accused them of improperly marketing their drugs.\n\nIn addition, the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, a part of the 2010 health reform law, will soon require all pharmaceutical and medical device companies to publicly report payments to physicians. The first disclosures required under the act are expected in September and will cover the period of August to December 2013.\n\nWithin the industry, some companies are re-evaluating the role of physician speakers in their marketing repertoire. GlaxoSmithKline announced in December that it would stop paying doctors to speak on behalf of its drugs. Its speaking tab plummeted from $24 million in 2011 to $9.3 million in 2012.\n\ntoggle caption ProPublica\n\nNot all companies have cut speaker payments: Johnson & Johnson increased such spending by 17 percent from 2011 to 2012; AstraZeneca's payments stayed about flat in 2012 after a steep decline the previous year.\n\nProPublica has been tracking publicly reported payments by drug companies since 2010 as part of its Dollars for Docs project. Users can search for their doctors to see if they have received compensation from the 15 companies that make such information available online. (We've just updated our application to include payments made through the end of 2012, totaling $2.5 billion. Forest Labs, which only began reporting in 2012, reported speaking payments of $40 million, more than any other company in Dollars for Docs.)\n\nSome companies in the database said their declines have less to do with the Sunshine Act and more to do with the loss of patent protection for key products. Lilly, for example, began facing generic competition to its blockbuster antipsychotic Zyprexa in late 2011. Its antidepressant Cymbalta lost its patent at the end of 2013.\n\n\"The value of educational programs tends to be higher when we're launching a new medicine or we have new clinical data/new indication,\" Lilly spokesman J. Scott MacGregor said in an email, adding that the drop in speaking payments also reflects the increased use of Web conferencing.\n\nPfizer's patent on Lipitor, its top-selling cholesterol drug, expired in 2011.\n\n\"Like any other company, our business practices must adapt to the changing nature of our product portfolio, based in part on products going off patent and new products being introduced into the market,\" company spokesman Dean Mastrojohn said in an email.\n\nNovartis' patent for its breast cancer drug Femara expired in 2011, its hypertension drug Diovan in 2012 and its cancer drug Zometa in 2013. In a statement, Novartis said speaking payments dropped in 2012 in part because of a shift from big blockbuster drugs that many doctors prescribe toward specialty products prescribed by fewer physicians. Resources were also shifted \"to support potential future product launches,\" a spokeswoman said in an email.\n\nOne of the first drugmakers to disclose its payments to doctors has pulled the data offline. Cephalon, now a subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, had reported its ties to doctors since 2009 under the terms of a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services. The pact was put in place after the company agreed to pay a $425 million settlement in 2008 for marketing Actiq, Gabitril and Provigil for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. But that requirement expired last September, and Teva pulled the data offline earlier this year when it updated its website. Cephalon's payments from 2009 to 2012 continue to be available on ProPublica's Dollars for Docs website, which aggregates payments made by 15 pharmaceutical companies since 2009. During that time, the company reported nearly $90 million in payments to doctors. The gap in the company's disclosures will be short. Teva will have to resume publicly reporting its payments to doctors later this year under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires that all pharmaceutical and medical device companies disclose payments over $10 to doctors. The first report, covering the period of August to December 2013, is expected to be released in September of this year.\n\nThe industry's increased emphasis on expensive specialty medications for such conditions as multiple sclerosis or hepatitis C has been striking, said Aaron Kesselheim, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. A piece in the New England Journal of Medicine last week noted that half of the 139 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration since 2009 were for rare diseases and cancers.\n\n\"It's possible the number of physicians they need to support sales of these items is less, leading to lower payments overall,\" Kesselheim said.\n\nIn some cases, companies maintained or made smaller cuts to other forms of physician compensation while pulling back dramatically on speaking payments. Pfizer's spending on consultants dropped 9 percent from 2011 to 2012, far less than its payments to speakers. The company's spending on research stayed essentially the same.\n\nLilly increased spending on physician researchers by more than 20 percent, while reducing payments to consultants by more than two-thirds.\n\nMany bioethicists and leaders of major academic medical centers frown upon physicians delivering promotional talks for drug companies, saying they turn doctors into sales representatives rather than leaders in research and patient care.\n\nOfficials with Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry trade group, dispute this characterization. They said they are working with their member companies to prepare for the Sunshine Act and have created a campaign to promote the value of drug company-doctor collaborations.\n\n\"Companies will make their own independent decisions about how to engage professionals,\" said Kendra Martello, PhRMA's deputy vice president of strategic operations.\n\nScott Liebman, an attorney who advises pharmaceutical companies on the Sunshine Act, said it's too early to know how much the law's requirements are affecting company practices, in part because it's so new. The fact that some companies are cutting back on speaking while preserving their spending on research and consulting suggests that other business forces could be at play, he added.\n\n\"It's very hard to pinpoint exactly why that's happening,\" Liebman said. \"I think there's a lot of potential answers to that. I just don't know which is the right one.\"", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "description": "The sharp decline in payments coincides with increased scrutiny of drug marketing.
