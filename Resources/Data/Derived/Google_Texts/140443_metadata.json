John Thune, R-S.D., he is offering a contrasting message and sharing a philosophy shaped by wide-ranging life experiences.\n\n\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, he and his Navy crewmates loaded bombs onto jets off the coast of North Vietnam.\n\n\n\n\u201cThat experience gave me an insight of what war is, and a belief that we should only do that kind of thing, that kind of terrible power, in the very last resort,\u201d Williams said at the District 22 Democratic Forum on Thursday.\n\n\n\nAfter earning his wings, he flew search and rescue missions. Later, he and his wife served in the Peace Corps in South America.\n\n\n\nWilliams returned to college and received a master\u2019s degree in computer science, later working as a software engineer in Texas and California.\n\n\n\nIn 1986, they moved to South Dakota \u2014 he\u2019s a Gettysburg native and a grandson of that town\u2019s first mayor \u2014 and opened a small business thanks to a Revolving Economic Development Initiative (REDI) fund loan. Williams has owned and operated his Yankton business for 30 years.\n\n\n\nThe 2013 government shutdown at a time when West River was experiencing an historic blizzard, and the Republican Party\u2019s attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act that has provided health insurance for 20 million Americans, are reasons he decided to challenge Thune.\n\n\n\nWilliams is also angry that Republican senators are refusing to hold hearings on President Obama\u2019s choice of a moderate judge to serve on the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not anti-Republican,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBoth of my grandfathers and my dad were Republican. But the Republican Party of the 1950s is not the Republican Party of today.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe points to President Eisenhower, a Republican who served two terms in the White House, who was responsible for one of the largest public works projects in American history \u2013 the interstate highway system.\n\n\n\nBut there\u2019s also the Republican platform of 1956. Its planks included preservation of Social Security, asylum for refugees, extension of the minimum wage, expansion of the unemployment benefits system, a strengthening of labor laws and equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThose aren\u2019t policies that anybody in the modern-day Republican Party would support,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m running because of that sort of uncompromising, really anti-American behavior of the Republicans in general,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nWilliams would bring a willingness to compromise to the Senate if elected.\n\n\n\nBut he also believes income inequality must be rectified, and that climate change should be taken far more seriously.\n\n\n\nIn 2015, he said 47 percent of households in the United States were unable to pay a $400 unexpected expense. Their options were to turn to friends or family, take out a payday loan or simply not pay the bill. \u201cMeanwhile, the top 1 percent has 40 percent of the nation\u2019s wealth,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWith that kind of income disparity, it\u2019s bad for our country.\u201d\n\n\n\nDespite the naysayers, the American economy is growing. The stock market is at a record high and unemployment stands at 5 percent, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn spite of what the Republicans tell you, the economy is actually doing well,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThe problem is, it\u2019s doing really well for the guys at the top and not so well for the ordinary working people.\u201d\n\n\n\nSince the beginning of the industrial revolution, about 1900, the climate has warmed a full one degree, he said. It doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but he said that by 2025 the polar ice cap will disappear during the summer.\n\n\n\nIf that happens, the whiteness of the ice and snow that reflects the sun will be gone, and the sun will be absorbed by the ocean.\n\n\n\n\u201cInvesting in fossil fuels at a time when we need to get away from fossil fuels is a bad idea,\u201d Williams said. \u201cWe need wind and solar, and we need to let the EPA do its job.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor the complete article see the 04-09-2016 issue.\n\n\n\nClick here to purchase an electronic version of the 04-09-2016 paper.\n\n\n\nShare on Facebook HURON \u2014 Jay Williams says today\u2019s Republican Party is not the Republican Party of his father or his two grandfathers.As he travels the state as a Democratic U.S. Senate candidate running against Sen.
