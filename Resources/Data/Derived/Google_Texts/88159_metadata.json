Burwell, Republican state legislators in states that formed state health insurance exchanges during the implementation of Obamacare are actively seeking to transfer those operations to the federal government.\n\nWith federal contributions for states\u2019 implementation of Obamacare beginning to run out, these lawmakers argue operating a state health insurance exchange is a luxury their taxpayers can\u2019t afford.\n\nNo more federal grants were awarded after January 1, 2015, so all state health insurance exchanges will bear the full cost beginning January 1, 2016.\n\nDouble Whammy\n\nThe combined impact of SCOTUS\u2019 decision and funding termination on state-run exchanges is likely to be profound, especially with so many of them already being in financial trouble, says Dr. Doug Perednia, author of Overhauling America\u2019s Healthcare Machine.\n\n\u201cAs of May 2015, roughly half of the 17 exchanges established by states were in financial trouble,\u201d Perednia said. \u201cWith the subsidies removed, there is little or no reason for states to continue operating their own exchanges, and we will see many, if not all of them, disappear over time.\u201d\n\n\u2018Wise States\u2019 Stayed Out\n\nTwila Brase, president of the Citizens\u2019 Council for Health Freedom, says the states that did not set up health insurance exchanges will be able to get premium subsidies from the federal government through Healthcare.gov because of the Supreme Court decision.\n\n\u201cThese states dodged the bullet,\u201d says Brase. \u201cThey were the wise states. They saw the expensive trap. They saw the federal control over the state exchange and said no.\u201d\n\nStates without exchanges have no doubt seen how difficult it was for those with state exchanges, Brase says.\n\nBrase cites several examples. Oregon wasted $300 million, never got its exchange running, and switched to Healthcare.gov. Hawaii started shutting down its state exchange before the Supreme Court ruled. Nevada switched to the federal exchange. Colorado added new fees to try to cover the cost.\n\n\u201cNo state, no legislature, and no governor will likely even consider the idea [of opening a state exchange now,]\u201d Brase said. \u201cNot creating an exchange improves the state budget, lets the state use those dollars for more pressing priorities, and prevents the lawsuits, technological snafus, bad press, and defeat other states have faced,\u201d says Brase. \u201cI expect many states will terminate their state exchanges.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Exchange Disaster\n\nThe Minnesota exchange just reported a backlog of 180,000 reenrollments caused by technical problems, Brase says.\n\n\u201cThis may be the end of MNsure, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange,\u201d Brase said. \u201cCome next session, I expect Minnesota to consider a repeal of the MNsure exchange and a switch to Healthcare.gov.\n\n\u201cI expect much or all of the entire exchange enterprise will be on the shoulders of the federal government until the law is repealed,\u201d Brase said. \u201cDemocrats in the U.S. House wanted a national exchange. It appears that\u2019s what they\u2019re going to get, although it\u2019s still not fully functional and the funding for it may become a political football as a way to impede continued implementation of the law.\u201d\n\nDefaulting to Federal Exchange\n\nThe ruling in Burwell puts many of the remaining state-based exchanges on a death watch, says Josh Archambault, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Government Accountability.\n\n\u201cMany of the state-based exchanges have had low enrollment, so they are unlikely to be sustainable on their own,\u201d Archambault said. \u201cWith federal taxpayer money drying up, it is likely state legislatures will eventually follow the lead of Hawaii, Nevada, and Oregon and default to Healthcare.gov. It may take a few years in a handful of states to make this move, due to ideological or political reasons, but most states are not likely to spend $50\u2013100 million a year keeping a state-based exchange afloat at the expense of education programs, public safety, or road projects.\u201d\n\nSome states, have already started to discuss using even more state funds to keep their state-based exchange open, while others are considering assessing a fee on all insurance plans sold in their state. Some are even considering taxing plans not sold on the exchange in addition to those that are, Archambault says.\n\n\u201cIf small businesses and state lawmakers wise up, this proposal will be challenged, as it raises the expense of insurance for everyone in the state unnecessarily and is in direct contradiction to the name and stated goal of the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Archambault said.\n\nKenneth Artz (iamkenartz@hotmail.com) is managing editor of Health Care News.\n\nInternet Info\n\nKenneth Artz, \u201cObamacare Subsidies Survive Supreme Court Challenge,\u201d Heartlander, June 25, 2015: http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2015/06/25/obamacare-subsidies-survive-supreme-court-challenge", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis may be the end of MNsure, the state\u2019s health insurance exchange,\u201d Brase said.\nNo more federal grants were awarded after January 1, 2015, so all state health insurance exchanges will bear the full cost beginning January 1, 2016.\n\u201cMany of the state-based exchanges have had low enrollment, so they are unlikely to be sustainable on their own,\u201d Archambault said.\nWith federal contributions for states\u2019 implementation of Obamacare beginning to run out, these lawmakers argue operating a state health insurance exchange is a luxury their taxpayers can\u2019t afford.\n\u201cNo state, no legislature, and no governor will likely even consider the idea [of opening a state exchange now,]\u201d Brase said."}
