Before completing a single term in the U.S. Senate, Obama vanquished Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton, crushed Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain, parlayed amorphous platitudes like \u201chope and change\u201d into landslide victory, captured the Nobel Peace Prize, crowbarred Obamacare through Congress \u2013 and then capped if off by cruising to reelection over former Gov. Mitt Romney.\n\nLike Belichick, Obama is wildly successful, but not particularly honest \u2013 at least according to a growing number of Americans: In 2009, 78 percent of Americans had a favorable personable opinion of Obama (a scant 18 percent had a negative opinion), yet by 2014, 52 percent viewed him negatively and just 47 percent viewed him positively. Likewise, from 2008 through June of 2012, over 60 percent of Americans considered Obama honest and trustworthy; by June 2014, that number plummeted to 47 percent. (For more information, see Gallup.)\n\nMore than just footballs, it seems, have deflated: Obama\u2019s oft-asserted promise that, \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep it,\u201d was named PolitiFact\u2019s 2013 Lie of the Year.\n\nIn American mythology, George Washington never told a lie. In football mythology, Miami Dolphins Hall of Fame running back Larry Csonka once found the Oakland Raiders game plan prior to their football game. Excited, Csonka handed the game plan to Monte Clark (the Miami offensive line coach), telling him to give it to head coach Don Shula. Miami lost to the Oakland. The following day, Csonka confronted Clark: \u201cHow did we lose? We had their game plan.\u201d Clark answered: \u201cI gave it to Don [Shula] and he threw it in the trash. He said, \u2018We do not cheat!\u2019\u201d\n\nDifferent men of a different generation.\n\nDuring his 2015 State of the Union address, the President declared: \u201cI have no more campaigns to run.\u201d That statement eerily echoed Coach Belichick\u2019s feigned bewilderment over the deflated footballs; in truth, Obama hasn\u2019t stopped campaigning, nor will he stop campaigning.\n\nIt\u2019s who he is.\n\nWhen the GOP won majorities in the House and Senate in 1994, a chastened President Clinton began his State of the Union address with a simple acknowledgement: \u201c\u2026all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, must say: We hear you. We will work together to earn the jobs you have given us.\u201d Clinton proceeded to cooperate with Congress, signing landmark legislation that included welfare reform, tax cuts and a balanced budget.\n\nIn contrast, President Obama didn\u2019t acknowledge the GOP\u2019s victory in his last State of the Union address. In fact, the only political victories he acknowledged were his own. And behind the scenes, instead of seeking compromise or attempting to cooperate with the GOP majorities, the White House dipped into the Belichick playbook and told Democrats that he would \u201cplay offense.\u201d\n\nEven though it\u2019s time to stop playing and start governing.\n\nAnd so, the campaign continues: President Obama used his State of the Union address to pound the war-drums for far-left political proposals that were too liberal to pass even when the Democrats controlled the House, the Senate and the White House during his first term: Tax-hikes, closing Guantanamo Bay, increased government spending, new federal entitlement programs, Iranian nuclear negotiations with no Congressional oversight, etcetera, etcetera.\n\nFor Obama, \u201cbipartisanship\u201d means speaking out of both sides of his mouth.\n\nThe president brazenly threatens to act unilaterally wherever he can, boasts of going over the heads on Congress, disregards immigration laws he personally dislikes, enacts executive actions of dubious constitutionality\u2026 and then is outraged when Congress acts on its own to invite the Israeli Prime Minister to speak \u2013 because they did so without including him.\n\nRules of decorum and the laws of the land, it seems, are for \u201cother people\u201d to follow. They don\u2019t apply to him.\n\nBill Belichick couldn\u2019t have scripted it any better.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Barack Obama and New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick: Professionally successful, but not always truthful or honest.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "President Barack Obama and New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick: Professionally successful, but not always truthful or honest.", "title": "President Obama: The Bill Belichick of Politicians", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/obama41.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/28/president-obama-the-bill-belichick-of-politicians/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama and New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick: Professionally successful, but not always truthful or honest.", "title": "President Obama: The Bill Belichick of Politicians", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/obama41.jpg", "creator": "@scottpinsker", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, Bill Belichick, Congress, NFL, Super Bowl,Big Government, Obama,bill belichick", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Super Bowl", "published_time": "2015-01-28T15:56:43-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Obama"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "We had their game plan.\u201d Clark answered: \u201cI gave it to Don [Shula] and he threw it in the trash.\nNot unlike the New England head coach, President Barack Obama is also uncommonly successful at his chosen profession.\nIn football mythology, Miami Dolphins Hall of Fame running back Larry Csonka once found the Oakland Raiders game plan prior to their football game.\nBill Belichick couldn\u2019t have scripted it any better.\nExcited, Csonka handed the game plan to Monte Clark (the Miami offensive line coach), telling him to give it to head coach Don Shula."}
