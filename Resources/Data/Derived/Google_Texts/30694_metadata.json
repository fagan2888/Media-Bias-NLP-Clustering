In most cases, they also apply to vending machine operators with 20 or more units.\n\nThe postponement from the previous Dec. 1 deadline was contained in final guidance from the Food and Drug Administration released on May 5.\n\nThe rule\u2019s start date has been so delayed that early critics, such as McDonald\u2019s Corp., have been displaying such information for years in compliance with rules set by California, New York City and other jurisdictions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hopeful that the date will stick,\u201d said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a long-time proponent.\n\nLobbyists for Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc., convenience stores and supermarkets helped push back the previous federal deadline, and the U.S. House of Representatives in February passed legislation aimed at the weakening rule.\n\nTackling the American obesity epidemic has been a signature issue for the White House and first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nThe White House publicly opposed the House bill saying it \u201cwould undercut the objective of providing clear, consistent calorie information to consumers.\u201d But, it stopped short of issuing a formal veto threat.\n\nWootan and other experts said that the Senate version of the opposition bill is expected to stall.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U.S. restaurant owners will have an extra five months to post the calorie counts of the food they sell under a new federal deadline of May 5, 2017.
