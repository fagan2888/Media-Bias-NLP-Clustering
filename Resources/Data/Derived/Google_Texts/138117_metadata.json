They predicted up to 100 million small and large business policies could be canceled next year.\n\nMore On This... Are we only scratching the surface of ObamaCare disaster?\n\nAccording to projections the administration itself issued back in July 2010, it was clear officials knew the impact of ObamaCare three years ago.\n\nIn fact, according to the Federal Register, its mid-range estimate was that by the end of 2014, 76 percent of small group plans would be cancelled, along with 55 percent of large employer plans.\n\nThe reason behind the losses is that current plans don't meet the requirements of ObamaCare, which dictate that each plan must cover a list of essential benefits, whether people want them or not.\n\n\"Things like maternity care or acupuncture or extensive drug coverage,\" said Veuger. \"And so now the law is going to force them to buy policies that they could have gotten in the past if they wanted to but they chose not to.\"\n\nSome plans already have been canceled and employers are getting sticker shock at the new, higher prices under ObamaCare.\n\nOne of them is David Allen, president of a company bearing his name in Boulder, Colorado. He told a Congressional hearing recently that his carrier discontinued his company policy because it wasn't compliant with ObamaCare.\n\n\"It does not meet the minimum standards as stipulated under the law. Due to this one change,\" he said, \"our premiums are now scheduled to increase by 52.3 percent in January 2014.\"\n\nRoy said that is not unusual. \"The old plans that are being cancelled are meaningfully cheaper than the new plans that are ObamaCare compliant.\"\n\nA new wave of cancellations and sticker shock will emerge just before next year's elections.\n\n\"They're going to start doing that in the summer or early fall but certainly before the midterm elections,\" said Veuger.\n\nJim Angle currently serves as chief national correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).
