'And if you take this line and you project what has been happening into the future, we will get less and less competitive. So we need something else.'\n\n\"Buffett insists that without changes to Obamacare average citizens will suffer.\n\n\"'What we have now is untenable over time,' said Buffett, an early supporter of President Obama. 'That kind of a cost compared to the rest of the world is really like a tapeworm eating, you know, at our economic body.'\n\n\"Buffett does not believe that providing insurance for everyone is the first step to take in correcting our nation's healthcare system.\n\n\"'Attack the costs first, and then worry about expanding coverage,' he said. 'I would much rather see another plan that really attacks costs. And I think that's what the American public wants to see. I mean, the American public is not behind this bill.'\"\n\nRepublicans should take Buffett's words as an invitation to propose a long-overdue Obamacare alternative, one that would lower costs, fix the unfairness in the tax code, deal with the specific problem of preexisting conditions, breathe life into a moribund individual insurance market, and constitute real reform. It's time to delay Obamacare and propose an alternative, then repeal Obamacare (in 2017) and pass the alternative.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Barack Obama,Health Care,Jeffrey H.
