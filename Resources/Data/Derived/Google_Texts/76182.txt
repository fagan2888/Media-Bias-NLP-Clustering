Trader Joe’s in an internal memo that circulated last week announced that it would cut health benefits for employees who work less than 30 hours per week.

And now the company has supposedly responded to a customer who was upset with this decision.

“It’s possible you have been misled, at least to some degree, by the headlines in some articles regarding our reasons for implementing the [Affordable Care Act] in January,” the Trader Joe’s email reads.

The email goes on lay out its case.

“The ACA brings a new potential player into the arena for the acquisition of health care. Stated quite simply, the law is centered on providing low cost options to people who do not make a lot of money,” the email reads.

“Somewhat by definition, the law provides those people a pretty good deal for insurance … a deal that can’t be matched by us — or any company,” it adds.

However, the email explains, individual employees are ineligible for the exchange tax credits if their company offers them a health insurance plan. So you Trader Joe’s won’t.

“Clearly, there are others who will go to the exchanges and will be required to pay more,” the email admits.

“That is usually because they have other income and typically a spouse who had a job with no benefits and they do not qualify for the subsidies under the ACA,” it adds.

As of this writing, it’s unclear whether the email response is authentic (but the Washington Post seems to think it is)
