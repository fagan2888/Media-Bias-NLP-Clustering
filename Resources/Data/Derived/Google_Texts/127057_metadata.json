What\u2019s deeper, though, is the vitriol of those beliefs, with a substantial number of Republicans believing that Obama resents America\u2019s heritage (47 percent), is the \u201cdomestic enemy that the U.S. Constitution speaks of\u201d (45 percent), wants to use an economic or terrorist event as an excuse to take dictatorial powers (41 percent), is doing some of the same stuff that Hitler did (38 percent), and may, in fact, be the Anti-Christ (24 percent). Daily Beast\n\nJust to begin by giving a quick answer to the question posed by the title of this post, \u201cWhy are so many Americans so crazy?\u201d. The answer is that living in a cloud of misinformation, they are being driven insane.\n\nThere is always the temptation to see certain people as reasonable when they aren\u2019t. \u201cCome now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. Isaiah 1:18,\u201d was the favorite bible passage of Lyndon Baines Johnson and it describes the basic attitude of all successful negotiators. The lesson learned from the epic battle to pass a more than tame and mediocre health bill or the reaction to legalizing human beings that have risked their lives to come to America, is that it is impossible to negotiate with whipped up insanity.\n\nAll of this insanity, from Tea Party to Obama being Antichrist is about using racism to distract people from seeing clearly what is right in front of their faces.\n\nEssentially what we have is Rupert Murdoch in the role of Joseph Goebbels nightly on Fox.\n\nThe idea is very simple, classic really. The system is in crisis, social inequality is widening and hardening, so stimulating paranoia and racism is a simple and effective way of keeping people from thinking about things like taxing the rich in order to get good public schools, affordable health care and other such Bolshevik twaddle.\n\nTo understand this craziness we have to turn it inside out. The first thing about it that catches my attention in the Harris and similar polls is that a significant portion of the American population is totally paranoid and extremely suggestible. If we discount genetics and/or some hallucinogen that has been added to the water, we would have to look at objective factors to account for this vulnerability.\n\nColor in the United States is just a \u201cwarning signal\u201d that history has walked into the room. But even history doesn\u2019t explain it all. Our history of slavery is pretty horrible, but slavery was horrible in Cuba and Brazil too. However, Cubans and Brazilians are much more relaxed about color. Americans, though, are not really relaxed about much of anything.\n\nOur culture is Calvinist: brittle and inflexible even in its hedonism, where, with predestination, the devil literally takes the hindmost.\n\nAlthough in many parts of Europe, for example, losing, being maudit, is considered romantic, the worst put down in American English is to call someone a \u201closer.\u201d\n\nTherefore, Americans are obsessed with \u201cwinning\u201d and \u201closing.\u201d\n\nThis makes American racial tension different \u2026 I think America\u2019s racism has something to do with America\u2019s puritanical streak, with its hatred of vulnerability and the vulnerable slaves were \u201closers\u201d par excellence.\n\nThe vulnerability of the \u201cother,\u201d whomever that other might be is the origin of the sickest of fantasies.\n\nThis role has been passed onto the slave\u2019s descendants.\n\nTo begin with America\u2019s cult of competition, of dividing people from childhood into \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers,\u201d has created an entire nation within the nation of losers: an enormous mass of people who feel terrible about themselves.\n\nThe American Dream is based on social mobility, but a great many Americans have not \u201cmoved\u201d up since they arrived, even many who arrived during colonial times. At this moment many are on an express elevator moving down.\n\nSince colonial times the subjugation and humiliation of African-Americans has provided a valuable tool in defusing social tensions in the rest of the population.\n\nIt all goes back that far.\n\nProbably the most valuable service to domestic peace that slaves provided even, or especially, for those who didn\u2019t own them, was the role of being someone even the most miserable white person could feel superior to.\n\nThe real problem in America is not racism in itself, the problem is a society or a culture that divides human beings into \u201cwinners\u201d and \u201closers\u201d and punishes the losers so mercilessly. These unfortunates simply cannot survive psychologically without their \u201cwhipping boy.\u201d Racism is a tool of social control. The classic \u201cdivide and rule.\u201d\n\nThat is the dirty little family secret of American capitalism: keeping the races at each others throats prevents the social democracy that exists in practically every other country of similar economic development.\n\nGod knows that America is full of desperately miserable white people. Not all of them are poor, not by long shot.\n\nFor losing and feeling miserable in America is not just economic, a study of marketing messages will give you an idea of the infinite ways that an American can be a \u201closer,\u201d while \u201cpursuing happiness\u201d (forever \u201cchasing,\u201d never catching).\n\nThe entire American consumer economy, which is 70% of the total, is based on making people feel bad about themselves, making them feel poor, ugly, sick, helpless, stupid, inadequate and then offering to sell them something to relieve the pain of rejection and failure. A person of color might blame all the frustrations of life on race prejudice and he or she would be right in most cases. The white loser, and they are legion, hasn\u2019t ever had even that safety valve.\n\nThose whites who fear they might be \u201closers\u201d themselves, and if we look at the economic and psychological facts of life in today\u2019s American, that might include most American whites, desperately need someone to look down upon as a psychological safety valve and of course, since time immemorial African-Americans, even the lightest skinned among them, have served that purpose. Their status as loser was even pleasing to the abolitionists that wanted to \u201cuplift\u201d them.\n\nFor literally hundreds of years, besides this role as the official ultimate-loser, no other role beyond entertaining or lifting heavy loads was permitted them.\n\nIn 1952 an African-American author, Ralph Ellison published a ground breaking novel, \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d, whose title many critics feel defined the experience of people of African descent in America: that of being invisible and voiceless. In the years that followed, the people of color in the United States raised their voices and became visible, to the great and continuing discomfort of many whites. The white people of the US south who once voted solidly Democratic have punished that party\u2019s leadership of the civil rights movement by voting solidly Republican ever since \u2026 the key to the victories of Nixon, Reagan and Bush. The \u201cConservative Revolution,\u201d that only favors the rich, is based on the resentment of poor whites and gives the wealthy the necessary numbers to win elections.\n\nWith Barack Obama this resentment is coming to head.\n\nUp till now, American \u201cidentity\u201d politics was always played with surrogates: WASP or \u201cwaspable\u201d white men wearing masks.\n\nThus Bill Clinton was \u201cAmerica\u2019s first black president.\u201d The whatever WASP whose turn it was to woo Latinos, would eat tacos and say \u201cjuntos podemos\u201d with an atrocious accent etc, etc. Candidates would attempt to show that they were \u201csensitive\u201d to the feminist agenda and so on. Absolutely de rigueur for all white, male and protestant presidentiables was a photo at Yad Vashem sporting a yomulka. This all came with the turf like kissing babies. It was all a game.\n\nThe problems start when the Democrats decided to use \u201coriginals\u201d instead of the traditional, \u201cballo in maschera.\u201d The whole charade begins to fall apart without the WASP surrogates.\n\nAll of this resentful white anger has been directed heretofore against surrogates: the Jimmy Carters, the Ted Kennedys, the Walter Mondales, the Dukakises, the Gores and the Kerrys; and all the racism was disguised in euphemisms like \u201cstate\u2019s rights\u201d or \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201celitist\u201d or \u201cun-American.\u201d\n\nNow for the first time the American white ultra-right have got the chance to actually organize and march against a real black man who incarnates all the euphemisms, instead of a surrogate.\n\nEven a \u201cJFK meets Sydney Poitier\u201d figure like president Barack Obama, or especially like Obama, is an unbearable provocation \u2014 a lifetime membership card in the \u201closer\u201d club \u2014 for millions of American white people.\n\nWhat is to be done? How to proceed.\n\nTake a look at the two quotes below. I think that between them they hold the germs of program for the American left\u2026 if such an animal really exists.\n\n\u201cReagan\u2019s view of government as the problem is increasingly at odds with a nation whose system of health care relies on large for-profit entities designed to make money rather than improve health; whose economy is dependent on global capital and on global corporations and financial institutions with no particular loyalty to America; and much of whose fuel comes from unstable and dangerous areas of the world. Under these conditions, government is the only entity that can look out for our interests.\u201d Robert Reich \u201cThe deeper point \u2014 the ones the tea partiers haven\u2019t courage nor the brains to see \u2014 is that our technological age has laid bare a core fact of American life: that our corporatist state uses white men and women just like it uses black, brown and yellow ones \u2014 as cannon fodder. There is little \u201cupward mobility.\u201d Your children probably won\u2019t live as well as you, much less better. Your 2nd and 3rd mortgages made them billions and then they bankrupted you. They stole your future itself. Leonce Gaiter\n\nThe ideas expressed here are not very complicated, they would be practically self-evident if so much time and media effort plus financial fiction had not been expended in clouding all these realities.\n\nWhen Robert Reich speaks of health care saying that America\u2019s \u201ceconomy is dependent on global capital and on global corporations and financial institutions with no particular loyalty to America,\u201d he is underlining one of the principal facts of our world today, i.e. non-state actors, like multinational corporations, effectively controlled by a small percentage of the share holders and/or a management elite, are often more powerful than elected governments. This means, as Reich points out, that empowering government, which we elect, is the only defense we have against these unelected, non-state actors, who are indifferent to our welfare, whose only motive is profit.\n\nLeonce Gaiter makes clear that this relationship with the non-state actors is an oppressive one and that with the bursting of the credit bubble and the destruction of the \u201cwealth effect\u201d created by endless credit, many people are finding themselves to be much less \u201cmiddle class\u201d then their advertising created fantasies led them to believe. Their treasured self-image is well tarnished and they are discovering that, as Gaiter says, \u201cour corporatist state uses white men and women just like it uses black, brown and yellow ones\u2013as cannon fodder.\u201d So in this crisis any person who lives from his salary and whose only patrimony is/was the house he lives/lived in, is, in the words of Marx and Engels, \u201cat last compelled to face with sober senses, his real conditions of life, and his relations with his kind.\u201d\n\nAlas, few are equipped either by temperament or by training to face with \u201csober senses\u201d either the \u201creal conditions\u201d of their lives or the \u201crelations with their kind.\u201d This lack makes them easy prey for movements like the Tea Party that fill the paths to truth with the traditional red herrings of American racism disguised as libertarianism.\n\nThis nauseating and supremely effective tactic is being trotted out once again.\n\nAt this moment the fundamental role of progressive Americans is to expose and root out the true causes of racism.\n\nThe day when Americans in similar economic straits cease to see skin color and see clearly and soberly what they all have in common, in the same way that the wealthy and powerful minority always have: on that day will the battle for social justice in the United States be more than half won.\n\nContent posted to MyMPN open blogs is the opinion of the author alone, and should not be attributed to MintPress News.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just to begin by giving a quick answer to the question posed by the title of this post, \"Why are so many Americans so crazy?\".
