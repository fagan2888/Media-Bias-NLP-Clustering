The early afternoon saw temps around 67 degrees that could reach the low 70s later in the day, he said.\n\nA cold front moving into the area will shake things up Monday with an inch of snowfall predicted for the metro area. Snow is expected to start falling in the afternoon, Kalina said. Temperatures, he said, would hover in the low 50s before they start falling.\n\nOn Tuesday, things are going to cool down even more with a high around 20 degrees and a 20 percent chance of light snow during the night.\n\nWednesday will get even more frigid, Kalina said, with an estimated high of 13 to 17 degrees. He said another inch of snow is likely.\n\nSnow should decrease Thursday, with highs in the lower 20s, and Friday is estimated to warm up a bit with temps in the mid 30s to low 40s, Kalina said.\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ehernandez", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Light snow and frigid temps on the way in Denver", "title": "Light snow and frigid temps on the way in Denver", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/09/light-snow-and-frigid-temps-on-the-way-in-denver/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141109__weather110914p1.jpg", "height": 392}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141109__weather110914p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-09T15:20:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T13:23:47+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d41\"", "article_summary": "A nearly record breaking warm Sunday in Denver will give way to snow and icy temperatures in the coming week.\nThe early afternoon saw temps around 67 degrees that could reach the low 70s later in the day, he said.\nSunday temperatures were a few degrees shy of the 76-degree record high, said meteorologist Jim Kalina.\nWednesday will get even more frigid, Kalina said, with an estimated high of 13 to 17 degrees.\nOn Tuesday, things are going to cool down even more with a high around 20 degrees and a 20 percent chance of light snow during the night."}
