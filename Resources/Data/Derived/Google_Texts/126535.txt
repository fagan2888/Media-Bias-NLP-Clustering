Congressman Charles Boustany will likely enter the race for U.S. Senate.

Boustany released this statement Monday morning.

“As a cardiovascular surgeon, I spent nearly thirty years caring for the sick and serving our community. As a United States Congressman, I have achieved the largest legislative repeal of ObamaCare to date, brought two new veterans clinics to Louisiana, stopped congressional leadership from robbing funding for our ports, and led the fight against the Obama Administration’s war on Louisiana energy.

“Louisiana deserves a United States Senator who can lead in times of challenge, offer conservative, workable solutions to complex problems, and bring unity in times of division. After careful deliberation with family and friends, I am planning a formal announcement event in my hometown of Lafayette in the near future. I look forward to outlining my vision for Louisiana and how I intend to help lead our state to the bright future I know lies before us.”

Boustany will make a formal statement in Lafayette at a later date.

Over the weekend Sen. David Vitter announced that he will not seek re-election next year. Vitter made the announcement during his concession speech.
