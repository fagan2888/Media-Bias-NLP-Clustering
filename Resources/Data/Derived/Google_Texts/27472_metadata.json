The others are in Kitchener, London, Mississauga, Hamilton, Brampton and Delta, B.C.\n\nMayor Daryl Bennett and Coun. Andrew Beamer were on hand for a special ribbon cutting ceremony, which also included David Tarski, co-owner of Talize with his brother Vitali, David\u2019s son Idan, also part of the business, store manager Brandon Parrott \u2013 among others. It also included activities for children such as balloons, clowns and magicians.\n\nThe store offers vintage, new and nearly-new fashionable merchandise\u2014with part of the proceeds going to support the Children\u2019s Wish Foundation. The selection ranges from housewares, books, toys and electronics to men's and women's clothing.\n\nNatasha Fieldman, manager of resource development Ontario chapter and Michelle Taylor, coordinator of community development national branch of the children\u2019s foundation in Pickering were also in attendance.\n\n\u201cI like the way it is set up and how clean and bright it is,\u2019\u2019 said Jones, among the early customers. \u201cEverything is easy to see and the quality and variety of the merchandise is very good. The staff is very friendly. It\u2019s easier for me to get to. I like its location and hopefully it will revitalize Portage Place. It\u2019s good they are helping the children, too. That\u2019s a great thing.\u2019\u2019\n\nAbout 100 people took in the special ceremony which included Bennett welcoming the new store and its 67-member staff unit to the community.\n\nThe chain has been in existence for about a decade and David Tarski said they had been looking at the Peterborough market for quite a while. It was just a question of real estate, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be in Peterborough,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe really like the community and where we are.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Tarskis are of Russian descent and the store name is a play on the family name, including he and his co-owner brother.\n\nDavid said there were three things of importance when it came to running the store.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about having the best selection for the best price, customer service and supporting a charity like the Children\u2019s Wish Foundation and the environment,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cWe like being in the community and helping the community. We are happy to help children.\u2019\u2019\n\nFieldman and Taylor were pleased to be there and said $1 million had been raised for the foundation.\n\n\u201cWe have received a lot of support,\u2019\u2019 said Fieldman.\n\nIt was difficult to determine how many customers came through the store this day but organizers said the 250 carts were gone within minutes of its opening and it remained busy throughout.\n\nThe store will be open Monday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Sundays 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.\n\ndale.clifford@sunmedia.ca", "article_metadata": {"description": "News, Local, Provincial, Canada, World, Sports, High School Sports, Local Hockey, Hockey, Basketball, Baseball, Football, Soccer, Lacrosse, Curling, Other Sports, Entertainment, Local, Movies, Music, Television,  Celebrities, Life, Health, Food, Travel, Money, Opinion, Editorial, Letters, Column, Your Newspaper, Social medias, Events, UR, News, Sports, Life, Entertainment, Money, Opinion, Marketplace, Photos, Videos, Contests, Polls, Weather, Sitemap, Event Submission", "author": "nurun.com", "og": {"image": "http://storage.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/v1/dynamic_resize/sws_path/suns-prod-images/1297535452128_ORIGINAL.jpg?quality=80&size=320x&stmp=1394397380495", "site_name": "Peterborough Examiner", "description": "Peterborough\u2019s Cheryl Jones was impressed the moment she walked into the store.", "title": "Many customers attend store opening"}, "pinterest": "nopin", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "fb": {"admins": 162622253780945}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d17\"", "article_summary": "The store offers vintage, new and nearly-new fashionable merchandise\u2014with part of the proceeds going to support the Children\u2019s Wish Foundation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about having the best selection for the best price, customer service and supporting a charity like the Children\u2019s Wish Foundation and the environment,\u2019\u2019 he said.\nIt was difficult to determine how many customers came through the store this day but organizers said the 250 carts were gone within minutes of its opening and it remained busy throughout.\nIt became the sixth in its thrift store chain in Ontario and seventh in Canada in the last decade.\nThe store will be open Monday to Saturday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Sundays 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.dale.clifford@sunmedia.ca"}
