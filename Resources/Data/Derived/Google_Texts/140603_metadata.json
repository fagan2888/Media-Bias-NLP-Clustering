According to the same survey, six in 10 workers have less than $25,000 in savings and retirement plans, again excluding the traditional plans and the value of a home.\n\nAnd what\u2019s worse, WorldatWork, a Scottsdale, Ariz., based human resources professionals association found people are \u201cleaving money on the table\u201d when saving for retirement by not taking full advantage of benefits such as a matching employer contribution to their retirement account.\n\n[READ: All the President's Bureaucrats]\n\nThese problems can be easily remedied by simply teaching students about financial literacy at an early age. Teaching financial literacy is also a great way to teach math (bringing to life the value of fractions and percentages) and to offer students the tools they need to navigate the complicated student lending process that many will enter when they go to college.\n\nSo far, according to Pew Trusts, only Missouri, Tennessee, Utah and Virginia require financial literacy education to graduate. However, many public charter schools have incorporated financial literacy in their core curriculum. After school and summer school programs have started to offer courses in financial literacy and students can now access financial literacy through many online programs.\n\nBut for the idea to take off, more states will need to require financial literacy as part of their core curriculum. Next to reading, nothing may prove to be more beneficial in preparing students for life.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Why Arne Duncan Is Right About Young Students and Finances", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Arne Duncan is right that more students need to learn financial literacy.", "title": "Learning the Facts of Financial Life", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/nina-rees/2014/07/14/why-arne-duncan-is-right-about-young-students-and-finances", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/f5/761bc37758a3d494b6c55458ff8e00/45260WideModern_GirlAllowance_072913.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "Arne Duncan is right that more students need to learn financial literacy.", "card": "summary", "title": "Why Arne Duncan Is Right About Young Students and Finances"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "July 14, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Nina Rees,economy,education,retirement,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Arne Duncan is right that more students need to learn financial literacy."}, "article_summary": "After school and summer school programs have started to offer courses in financial literacy and students can now access financial literacy through many online programs.\nBut for the idea to take off, more states will need to require financial literacy as part of their core curriculum.\n[READ: All the President's Bureaucrats]These problems can be easily remedied by simply teaching students about financial literacy at an early age.\nEducation Secretary Arne Duncan recently offered a compelling speech pushing American students to learn about money and finance in school.\nHowever, many public charter schools have incorporated financial literacy in their core curriculum."}
