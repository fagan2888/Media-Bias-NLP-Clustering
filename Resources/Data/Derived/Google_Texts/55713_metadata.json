The poll included \u201cSolid Liberals,\u201d who were described as having \u201cliberal attitudes across almost every realm.\u201d And boy, are they not the Lee Greenwood type or what?\n\nOnly 40 percent of the group said they \u201coften feel proud to be [an] American,\u201d far less than any of the other six groups surveyed and 16 percentage points less than the average. Likewise, only 40 percent said honor and duty were their core values.\n\nA shade over half, 51 percent, said they thought of themselves as typical Americans. What a cursed thing to be.\n\nBetween 66 and 75 percent of the other six groups, on the other hand \u2014 which were as disparate as the \u201cNext Generation Left\u201d and \u201cSteadfast Conservatives\u201d \u2014 said they viewed themselves as typical.\n\nOther categories of respondents included an up-and-coming faction of the Right, \u201cYoung Outsiders,\u201d defined as conservative on \u201cgovernment\u201d issues, but not social ones. For the most part, they gave common Americanism the thumbs-up.\n\n\u201cBeyond Red vs. Blue: The Political Typology\u201d is the second part of a series from Pew studying political polarization. The results were based on a national survey of more than 10,000 adults nationwide, conducted between January 23 and March 16.\n\nPew\u2019s previous typology study, released in May 2011, found that three of every four \u201cSolid Liberals\u201d believe the government is \u201coften better than people give it credit for\u201d \u2014 which if the IRS, the VA, the EPA, the NSA, the DOJ, the GSA, Obamacare, \u201cDude, this was like two years ago,\u201d and the \u201cbear with cabin fever\u201d are any indication, is spot-on.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "A new poll has found that a majority of those who describe themselves as \"solidly liberal\" don't care much for honor, duty, or America, and nearly half think of themselves as atypical citizens.", "title": "Poll: 'Solid liberals' think of themselves as irresponsible...", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://redalertpolitics.com/files/2014/06/bernie-sanders-a-600x400.jpg", "height": 400}, "url": "http://redalertpolitics.com/2014/06/26/poll-solid-liberals-think-irresponsible-un-american-special-snowflakes/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 1285945407, "app_id": 529886110401651}, "msvalidate.01": "0F003B4674EABE0F24651B476B61A43C", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RedAlertPolitics", "tag": "pew", "published_time": "2014-06-26T18:12:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-26T18:14:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcddd8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBeyond Red vs. Blue: The Political Typology\u201d is the second part of a series from Pew studying political polarization.\nThe poll included \u201cSolid Liberals,\u201d who were described as having \u201cliberal attitudes across almost every realm.\u201d And boy, are they not the Lee Greenwood type or what?\nThe Pew Research Center\u2019s \u201cBeyond Red vs. Blue\u201d survey, released Thursday, sorted respondents into groups that were defined by \u201cattitudes and values\u201d as much as ideological labels.\nThe results were based on a national survey of more than 10,000 adults nationwide, conducted between January 23 and March 16.\nOther categories of respondents included an up-and-coming faction of the Right, \u201cYoung Outsiders,\u201d defined as conservative on \u201cgovernment\u201d issues, but not social ones."}
