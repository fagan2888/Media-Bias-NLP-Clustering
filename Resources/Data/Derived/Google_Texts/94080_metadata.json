Olson said.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service hasn't done enough to provide guidance and answer employers' questions about how to submit forms to the government and workers about health coverage, Olson said April 15. The process, akin to distributing Form W-2 information, is mandatory for the first time this year.\n\nAgency officials have said that any employer that puts forth a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to comply won't be hit with the penalties, which could be as high as $6 million if the employer didn't send the correct information returns to the IRS or provide employees with health care coverage statements.\n\nOlson said this vague definition of compliance is causing anxiety among employers that are worried they will get hit with a penalty and then have to prove to the IRS they did their best to comply with the law.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not clear what the IRS\u2019s position is going to be on that,\u201d Olson told reporters after a House hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s creating a level of anxiety that I don\u2019t think we needed to have. We could\u2019ve avoided this level of anxiety.\u201d\n\nFrequently-asked-question pages on the website or notices could help employers understand how the IRS is framing their thinking, Olson said. \u201cWe want to see more guidance, even if it is put out there in a temporary format,\u201d she said.\n\nIn December, the IRS extended the deadlines by several months to give employers more time to check for mistakes in the data and produce the forms. Employers have until May 31 to submit the documents to the IRS for those not filing electronically, and June 30 for electronic filers\u2014versus the previous Feb. 29 due date for paper filings, and March 31 deadline for digital returns.\n\nFor More Information For more information, see Compensation and Benefits Library\u2019s Tax Aspects of Health Plans Under the Affordable Care Act chapter.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Laura Davison in Washington at ldavison@bna.com\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Brett Ferguson at bferguson@bna.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.bna.com/taxpayer-advocatego-easy-n57982070212/", "image": "http://www.bna.com/uploadedImages/BNA_V2/Company/BnaSocialShare.jpg", "description": "By  Laura Davison   April 15 \u2014 The IRS should be light-handed in imposing penalties on employers that don't meet the Affordable Care Act filing requirements this year, Taxpayer Advocate...", "title": "Taxpayer Advocate:Go Easy on \u2018Good Faith' Employers on ACA"}, "csrf-token": "ug9RkKBWj2onyaKd42BOTWE8Ao-YxcPOjEVTUFbivTkno1hu-hVNAodY8Suaj1EUSTPcPW4Ju82LKWsIMJ9bNYo2B5-rGzHHOrrVSIjj62Y1:DEuxnu_N0kSLoBXdWiewmQ-evjbrlJQK53j22K-JdFeEY17bmg5Ez-Mj8EjPj-yHTXsoW2fZmyc9no00rGzh4pE96fQbEXBRPfn6ZKlCaBw1", "description": "By  Laura Davison   April 15 \u2014 The IRS should be light-handed in imposing penalties on employers that don't meet the Affordable Care Act filing requirements this year, Taxpayer Advocate", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fragment": "!"}, "article_summary": "For More Information For more information, see Compensation and Benefits Library\u2019s Tax Aspects of Health Plans Under the Affordable Care Act chapter.\nBy Laura DavisonApril 15 \u2014 The IRS should be light-handed in imposing penalties on employers that don't meet the Affordable Care Act filing requirements this year, Taxpayer Advocate Nina E.
