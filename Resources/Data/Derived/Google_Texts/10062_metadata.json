Then a 28-year-old striker, Irving played in seven games for the old Tulsa Roughnecks, scored three goals and soon moved on to the North American Soccer League club in Atlanta.\n\nIrving said he hopes for a longer stay this time.\n\nThe first manager of the new Tulsa Roughnecks, Irving spent much of the past six weeks looking for players to fill out a roster capable of competing in the USL Pro league.\n\n\u201cThe level of play is higher than most people give it credit for,\u201d said Irving, a member of the USL Pro Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cIf I had to pick a team of players out of our league to play in MLS, I think we could make the playoffs.\u201d\n\nMLS, or Major League Soccer, is the top tier of U.S. and Canadian soccer. USL Pro is the third tier \u2014 roughly the equivalent of baseball\u2019s Double-A \u2014 behind a new version of the North American Soccer League.\n\nIrving said he hopes to have a core squad of 10 to 12 players under contract when preseason practice begins in mid-February. The season begins in March.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make (games) a fun night out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to score some goals. I don\u2019t like to sit back. I hope we can find enough quality players to be competitive right from the start.\u201d\n\nPeople to watch in 2015", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "soccer in the united states,david irving,tulsa roughnecks,usl pro,north american soccer league,wilmington hammerheads,tulsa,striker,usl pro league,usl pro hall of fame,major league soccer,local,religion,state,usworld,randykrehbiel", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "New Roughnecks' coach hopes for a longer stay this time.", "title": "10 people to watch in 2015: David Irving", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/local/people-to-watch-in-david-irving/article_b62e13f2-7571-535e-a4e5-e59374804f9a.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/7/d6/7d6af72f-01bf-5723-8df9-3a496563270c/549dfa82d687a.preview-100.jpg?resize=223%2C200", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary", "creator": "@@rkrehbiel"}, "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "soccer in the united states,david irving,tulsa roughnecks,usl pro,north american soccer league,wilmington hammerheads,tulsa,striker,usl pro league,usl pro hall of fame,major league soccer,local,religion,state,usworld,randykrehbiel", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/https://www.facebook.com/randy.krehbiel"}, "description": "New Roughnecks' coach hopes for a longer stay this time."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe level of play is higher than most people give it credit for,\u201d said Irving, a member of the USL Pro Hall of Fame.\nI hope we can find enough quality players to be competitive right from the start.\u201dPeople to watch in 2015\nUSL Pro is the third tier \u2014 roughly the equivalent of baseball\u2019s Double-A \u2014 behind a new version of the North American Soccer League.\nThen a 28-year-old striker, Irving played in seven games for the old Tulsa Roughnecks, scored three goals and soon moved on to the North American Soccer League club in Atlanta.\nRemember me on this computer Login Screen Name or Email Now I remember!"}
