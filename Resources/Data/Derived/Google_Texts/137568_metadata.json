A woman who appealed for money online to help care for her autistic son and disabled husband has been charged with murder in connection with allegations that she threw her 6-year-old boy to his death off the bridge Monday.\n\nThe arrest in Oregon of Jillian McCabe, who police say threw her 6-year-old autistic son off a bridge to his death, raises questions about what can be done to better support the parents of children with severe autism, and to better protect children with disabilities from potential abuse.\n\nMs. McCabe called 911 to report what she\u2019d done to her son, London Grey McCabe, and told police she heard voices in her head, The Oregonian reported. Earlier this year, she had reached out for funds and prayers on YouCaring.com, describing how she was caring for both her son and her husband, who was unable to work because of a serious medical condition.\n\nThe case follows another in Michigan last year, in which Kelli Stapleton pleaded guilty to a felony charge of first-degree child abuse after shutting herself and her 14-year-old daughter Isabelle into a van with burning charcoal. The two were found unconscious from carbon monoxide poisoning. She was recently sentenced to 10 to 22 years in prison.\n\nRecommended: Are you a Helicopter Parent? Take our quiz\n\nMs. Stapleton had blogged about the difficulties of caring for Issy and the violence her daughter had sometimes unleashed upon her. After both recovered, she spoke about how she had envisioned the two of them having a happier relationship in heaven. At her sentencing hearing, experts spoke about psychiatric factors in her background that could have played a role.\n\n\u201cThese are both clearly cases of people who were overwhelmed by many problems,\u201d not just the challenge of having a child with autism, says Vincent Strully Jr., CEO and founder of The New England Center for Children, a private nonprofit school for children with autism.\n\nBut because of the spotlight on these cases, he says, \u201cit is a time to say to people, \u2018Do you have any idea what these folks who have challenging autistic children are going through?\u2026 Services are so scattered and uneven across the country\u2026. They live in an eternal state of anxiety. Their worries and fears never go away.\u201d\n\nProgress is being made \u2013 through state laws and changes to insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia, for instance, have passed autism insurance reform laws, the advocacy group Autism Speaks reports. But whether it\u2019s related to insurance or their children\u2019s education, parents are still often \u201cleft to fend for themselves,\u201d Mr. Strully says.\n\nMs. Stapleton had dedicated herself to working with Issy and helping improve her behavior, and Issy had also received intensive treatment at a residential facility. But shortly after she returned home, Issy began hitting her mother again, according to an account in New York Magazine. And the local high school where Issy was supposed to attend decided not to let her come. The carbon monoxide poisoning took place several days later.\n\nIn the United States, there are about 500 cases a year of a parent killing his or her child. That number has remained relatively stable even as the population has grown between 1976 and 2007, the years studied by Brown University researchers in 2014. Among the children killed, 72 percent were under 6 years old. Among the more than 15,000 cases, 57 percent involved fathers accused of the killing.\n\nForensic psychiatrist Phillip Resnick reviewed studies on maternal filicide (a mother killing her child) and found that many had depression, suicidal thoughts, psychosis, or previous mental health treatment. Among the five common motivations were altruism (the belief that the child will be better off if killed), acute psychosis (where the motive isn\u2019t understandable and they commonly report hearing voices), and the child being unwanted or thought to pose a burden.\n\nDr. Resnick also found that 16 to 29 percent of filicides include the mother\u2019s suicide. He recommended that psychiatrists inquire more about the children\u2019s well-being among mentally ill mothers, and that the bar for hospitalizing them when they are suicidal should be set lower because of the potential for filicide.\n\nSuch cases point to the need for more progress in societal attitudes toward people with disabilities, because the historical notions that life with a disability isn\u2019t worth living, or that life will be ruined for parents who have a severely disabled child, still persist, says Curt Decker, executive director of the National Disability Rights Network in Washington.\n\nCombine these attitudes with the genuine frustration of failing to access needed resources, and it can \u201cput parents under extreme stress to where they might do something untoward,\u201d Mr. Decker says, though most find ways to cope.\n\nDecker says he is monitoring a trend in which thousands of parents have inquired about the controversial \u201cAshley Treatment,\u201d named after a severely disabled girl whose parents pursued medical treatment about a decade ago to stunt her growth and sterilize her, with the idea that they could better care for her and protect her. Decker says he\u2019s particularly concerned that ethicists have supported this type of treatment by saying the burden on the parents needs to be weighed.\n\n\u201cThis sort of devaluing a child with a disability to the point of dong things with [her] that we would just not accept for anybody else \u2026 is a very slippery slope,\u201d Decker says.\n\nThe Autism Society, based in Bethesda, Md., has a contact center staffed by professionals that can be reached at 1-800-3-AUTISM.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "daa6922a401e963de8016991e8022862", "sailthru.author": "Stacy Teicher Khadaroo", "description": "The case of an Oregon woman who, police say, threw her autistic son off a bridge highlights the sort of situations in which families feel they can't cope with a disabled child.", "sailthru.image.std": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2014/11/1105-OREGON-BRIDGE-DEATH.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "author": "The Christian Science Monitor", "og": {"site_name": "The Christian Science Monitor", "description": "The case of an Oregon woman who, police say, threw her autistic son off a bridge highlights the sort of situations in which families feel they can't cope with a disabled child.", "title": "Oregon autism death raises awareness of how to help overwhelmed families (+video)", "url": "http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2014/1105/Oregon-autism-death-raises-awareness-of-how-to-help-overwhelmed-families-video", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2014/11/1105-OREGON-BRIDGE-DEATH.jpg?alias=standard_900x600", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@csmonitor", "image": "http://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2014/11/1105-OREGON-BRIDGE-DEATH.jpg?alias=standard_380x253", "description": "The case of an Oregon woman who, police say, threw her autistic son off a bridge highlights the sort of situations in which families feel they can't cope with a disabled child.", "card": "summary", "title": "Oregon autism death raises awareness of how to help overwhelmed families (+video)"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-11-05", "DC.date.issued": "2014-11-05T16:33:04-05:00", "fb": {"page_id": 14660729657, "app_id": 179793002061452}, "sailthru.content.body": "http://www.csmonitor.com/layout/set/rssfull/USA/2014/1105/Oregon-autism-death-raises-awareness-of-how-to-help-overwhelmed-families-video", "sailthru.tags": "section-usa,class-article,storysource-monitor", "article": {"section": "USA", "published_time": "2014-11-05T16:33-05"}, "copyright": "The Christian Science Monitor", "sailthru.image.credit": "Beth Nakamura/The Oregonian/AP/File"}, "article_summary": "The case of an Oregon woman who, police say, threw her autistic son off a bridge highlights the sort of situations in which families feel they can't cope with a disabled child.\nThirty-seven states and the District of Columbia, for instance, have passed autism insurance reform laws, the advocacy group Autism Speaks reports.\nThe Autism Society, based in Bethesda, Md., has a contact center staffed by professionals that can be reached at 1-800-3-AUTISM.\nIn the United States, there are about 500 cases a year of a parent killing his or her child.\nBut shortly after she returned home, Issy began hitting her mother again, according to an account in New York Magazine."}
