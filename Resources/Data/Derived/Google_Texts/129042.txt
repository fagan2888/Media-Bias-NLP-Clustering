Is Obamacare the cure-all for what ails the U.S. healthcare system?

Not according to Dr. John Geyman.

In his newly published book, "How Obamacare is Unsustainable," Geyman contends the three primary goals of the Affordable Care Act's three primary goals—affordability, near-universal coverage and improved quality of care—are not being met and that a single-payer healthcare system is the best solution for all Americans, and for reform of U.S. health care.

Professor emeritus of the University of Washington School of Medicine and founding editor of "The Journal of Family Practice" (1973 to 1990), and a resident of Friday Harbor, Geyman offers up an "evidence-based" assessment of the good and bad about the ACA, the signature domestic legislation of the Obama presidency.

A former chairman of the Department of Family Medicine at UW, 1976-1990, Geyman was a practicing physician at Friday Harbor former Inter Island Medical Center from 1990 to 1997, and is a member of the San Juan County Board of Health.

Vanderbilt University Medical Center's Dr. Larry Churchill has this to say about Geyman's book: "John Geyman has provided us with the most lucid, best documented, and most compelling portrait of what's wrong with the Affordable Care Act yet available. He also argues forcefully for the fix we need. This is an invaluable contribution to our understanding of U.S. healthcare, and the essential playbook for policy change."

Published by Copernicus Healthcare, Geyman's book, at 382 pages and $18.95, includes illustrative figures and tables, and is available for purchase in paperback at Amazon.com and in eBook at the Kindle Store.

Geyman is author of four earlier book focused on the U.S. healthcare system, including "Health Care Wars: How Market Ideology and Corporate Power Are Killing Americans," and, "Hijacked: The Road to Single Payer In The Aftermath of Stolen Health Care Reform."
