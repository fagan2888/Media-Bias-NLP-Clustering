Stanford students are combining their technical and arts passions for a spring production of “Rent.”

The spring show is presented by Ram’s Head Theatrical Society, a student group that taps students’ interests in both technical and artistic fields. In the video above, we hear from a couple students about their experiences working on the production:Stanford senior Matt Lathrop, a computer science major with a focus in digital graphics, and Shalmali Bane, a senior biology major with a concentration in neurobiology, are both science-oriented but have been involved in a number of arts organizations on campus — even holding leadership positions. They were directly involved in at least ten theatre productions each during their four years at Stanford.Lathrop and Bane illustrate that the sciences and arts can complement one another. Lathrop is president and founder of LITES, the student group that designs light technology, like the automated lights system for the spring musical, “Rent.” Bane is head costume designer for the show. Both feel adamant that arts education is important and should be continued as they both enjoy the opportunity to employ different strategies — whether they be arts or scientific — to solve problems.Information about tickets for “Rent” is online: http://musical.stanford.edu/ (Editor’s Note: Peninsula Press is a project of the Stanford Journalism Program at Stanford University.)
