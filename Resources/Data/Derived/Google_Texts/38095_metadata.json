I\u2019m talking way back, like to the Old Testament and the book of Revelation.\n\nHardly a day goes by without another dire warning about how we find ourselves at the mercy of war, pestilence and a third election in six years for Gov. Scott Walker. These can all be interpreted as sure signs of the coming apocalypse by doomsday preppers everywhere.\n\nOr maybe not? Maybe they aren\u2019t signs of an impending judgment by a universal God? Maybe they\u2019re just another sign that the American empire continues to lose its influence abroad and its common sense at home? It\u2019s impossible for anybody to know with certainty.\n\nIt is possible to know other things. We know that the latest war, this time against ISIL in Iraq and Syria, is another of our own choosing. Like all of our wars, it\u2019s marketed as a humanitarian effort. Our reaction to the primeval images of beheadings by murderers posing as a legitimate government was immediate and predictable. Just as our enemies wanted, we decided to give war another chance.\n\nWhen we go to war these days, our government takes great pride in building coalitions of like-minded countries as a show of support for our noble efforts. Saudi Arabia and Turkey are two of the nations that have signed up again as brothers in arms with the United States.\n\nThis seems odd when placed under any scrutiny. Saudi Arabia has a documented record of providing material support to ISIL in Syria. Vice President Joe Biden may have recently apologized to the Saudis for talking about it, but it\u2019s no secret that the Saudi government poured hundreds of millions of dollars to any extremist it could find in Syria that was willing to attack the Assad regime.\n\nIt turns out the Saudis also love to behead people. Human Rights Watch reported that the government of Saudi Arabia beheaded 19 people during a 17-day stretch in August. Some of the executed were non-violent offenders accused of sorcery and drug-dealing. Amnesty International reported that there was evidence that confessions used to condemn some of the accused were obtained through torture.\n\nOur NATO \u201cally\u201d Turkey also has a record of assisting the radical Islamists in Syria. For months, it provided an open border for new recruits coming to sign up from across the world. As long as they were attacking the Assad regime or the Kurds, our Turkish \u201callies\u201d seemed content to let ISIL loose upon its other perceived enemies. Even now, the Turkish government is reluctant to assist the Syrian Kurds under siege directly across its border.\n\nAt almost the same time that the fear of ISIL was reaching a tipping point, the news from West Africa became even more menacing. The Ebola virus doesn\u2019t have a political ideology or a religion. It doesn\u2019t need any excuses to engage in a killing spree. All it needs is time, opportunity and apathy. The Washington Post recently had a story that detailed how the initial reaction to this threat contained all three of those elements.\n\nAs if these two ominous signs weren\u2019t enough to push you to despair, we face the very real possibility that Walker will win another election. He\u2019s probably laughing it up with a radio personality pretending to be a billionaire right now as they discuss planting agitators in a public protest somewhere. I\u2019m not a religious man but even I can\u2019t help but thinking, \u201cGod help us all,\u201d in these circumstances.\n\nIn times like these, I comfort myself with the thought that it could always be worse. Besides, I don\u2019t have the ambition to start digging bunkers or the faith in a glorious rapture that will make it all go away. I\u2019d just like to live long enough to find out if the prophecy is Biblical or self-fulfilling.\n\n\u2014 Lyle Boggs is an Appleton resident.
