We care little about Constitutional procedure and less about the work of making the machinery work as the Founders intended. It\u2019s the thinking typical of political regimes\u2019 last days, when belief has gone and people just follow the forms. {We\u2019re back to one post per day, as I consider winding down this project.}\n\nThe Supreme Court has legalized same-sex marriages. David Fontana at Slate gives some of the typical liberal cheering for the Court\u2019s decision on same-sex marriages: \u201cThe Justices\u2019 Justice\u201d \u2014 \u201cFor years we feared the consequences of pushing social progress through the courts. Obergefell v. Hodges will prove we shouldn\u2019t.\u201d I suspect he\u2019s cheering prematurely.\n\nFor a clearer example of thinking on the Left see Matthew Yglesias\u2019 reaction, exultant and quite daft (red emphasis added)\u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s more, it\u2019s a huge analytic mistake to assume that striking down some law is an anti-majoritarian action. The way the United States government works is that change is very hard. Given the current state of gridlock in Washington, it\u2019s pretty clear that neither a gay marriage legalization bill nor a gay marriage illegalization bill could pass. On marriage equality, like on virtually every other issue, the status quo is simply likely to prevail. Into the breach steps the Supreme Court \u2014 in this case, on the side of the majority according to polls. All in all, I think the American system of checks-and-balances has a lot of flaws. But unelected judges invalidating unjust laws that a majority of the public wants invalidated is basically the system working at its best.\n\nYglesias cheers the new order when unelected Justices do our will, guided by polls. Self-government by couch potatoes, without politics, run by black-robed gurus!\n\nConservatives object to this decision (and that allowing Obamacare) in the traditional fashion of those unhappy with court decisions, talking about the court\u2019s pretensions to supremacy eroding its legitimacy, destabilizing the balance between the three branches, and a threat to representative government. It\u2019s the latest chapter of an argument going back to the 19th century (and the ruling about Dred Scott, the mother of judicial activist, in 1857).\n\nA more interesting aspect of the Left\u2019s cheering is their blindness to a major trend of our age. The Right has been gaining power at all levels of government since the late 1970s, including the courts. Conservative Justices are not shy about using their power, as we have seen from their rollback of the Voting Rights Act, campaign finance regulation, and a dozen other issues. It\u2019s a bad time for the Left to be cheering the discretionary exercise of judicial power.\n\nThe Left has had its turn running an activist court. Depending on the next few elections, now the Right might get a turn at the controls. Soon liberals like Yglesias might be yelling \u201cSTOP\u201d to the courts, repeating arguments the Right has made since the Warren Court.\n\nThese vignettes of the Left and Right trading places show the naked tribalism of our politics, and that neither side has much concern for the Constitutional machinery. That\u2019s our responsibility. If we don\u2019t care, nobody cares, and the machinery eventually will break. We must care about how the law is made as much or more than its text.\n\nThe Court\u2019s weak foundation\n\nThe concerns about the Court\u2019s activism eroding its legitimacy might prove correct. Gallup\u2019s data shows that American\u2019s confidence in the Supreme Court varied from 40% to 56% between 1973 and 2006. Since then it\u2019s run between 30% and 39%. It was 30% in 2014, and 32% in June 2015 \u2014 the lowest levels of this Gallup poll\u2019s 42 year long record.\n\nWhat happens if it breaks down into the 20%\u2019s? The Courts lack the inherent legitimacy of Congress and the Presidency produced by elections. The other branches might begin to pushback against judicial over-reaching. Future presidents might reuse Andrew Jackson\u2019s (apocryphal) words: the Court has made its decision, now let them enforce it.\n\nThe big picture\n\nLaughter from Europe greeted the Constitution\u2019s birth, from their confidence that a regime could not endure based on its people\u2019s love of liberty and their self-disciplined allegiance to mutually-agreed upon rules. Perhaps they were right.\n\nRespect for the words of the Constitution, for the specific consent of the people which empowered it, for the love of the Constitution in the people\u2019s hearts \u2026 all of these things fade away, day by day. Unless we change course, eventually the American Constitution will become a minor procedural document, a guidebook for the jousts elites hold to determine their relative power in the new regime.\n\nOur Constitution is just an idea which we inherited from the Founders. We created it, and its death will give us the experience to do better with the next version. The Constitution is not America. We are America. We are strong because of our ability to act together, to produce and follow leaders. We are strong due to our openness to other cultures and ability to assimilate their best aspects. We are strong due to our ability to adapt to new circumstances, to roll with defeat and carry on.\n\nWe will be what we want to be. The coming years will reveal what that is.\n\nFor More Information\n\nRecommended: Waiting for SCOTUS\u201d by Rob Hunter at Jacobin \u2014 \u201cBy fixating on the Supreme Court, liberals have inherited the framers\u2019 skepticism of popular sovereignty and mass politics.\u201d\n\nIf you liked this post, like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.
