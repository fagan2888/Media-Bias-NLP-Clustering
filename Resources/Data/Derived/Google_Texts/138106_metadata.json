That\u2019s the question policymakers will likely take away from the findings of a new poll released Wednesday.\n\nConducted by Reuters-Ipsos, the survey asked 7,727 adults about their employment status and their intentions with regard to future work. Among those who identified themselves as retired, 40 percent reported that they had stopped working involuntarily. And 30 percent said that, if a job became available, they would effectively \u201cunretire\u201d and rejoin the workforce.\n\nRelated: Sluggish Wage Growth Hurst the Unemployed\n\nThis is part of the puzzle that Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen and her colleagues will be pondering later this week at their annual gathering in Jackson Hole, WY. The theme of the meeting is \u201cRe-evaluating Labor Market Dynamics.\u201d\n\nAfter supplying huge amounts of liquidity to the economy during the Great Recession, the Fed is now cutting back on its purchases of securities, and it is at least beginning to consider when it will start pushing interest rates above the near-zero level where they have been for the past few years.\n\nIn fact, when minutes of the most recent meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting were released Wednesday afternoon, some observers were surprised by the number of members who appeared to believe rate increases should come relatively soon.\n\nThe issue of interest rates is tied inextricably to the job market. The Fed has what\u2019s known as a \u201cdual mandate\u201d from Congress. The central bank is charged with maintaining price stability, meaning an acceptably low level of inflation, and with attaining maximum employment.\n\nRelated: Why Employers Are to Blame for the \u201cSkills Gap\u201d\n\nThe question of how quickly the economy is moving toward full employment is key to any decision about interest rates. If the job market tightens, wages should rise, which results in inflationary pressure on prices. Raising interest rates is a counter to inflationary pressure.\n\nBut right now, there is disagreement about how close the economy really is to full employment. With the current rate at 6.2 percent, nobody is arguing that we are anywhere near there yet. But while some economists believe the economy is approaching a point at which wage growth is inevitable, others, particularly Yellen, believe there is more \u201cslack\u201d in the labor market than the official unemployment rate measures.\n\nThe theory \u2013 backed up by the Reuters-Ipsos finding \u2013 is that many workers who are not now considered part of the workforce, will continue filtering back into the ranks of those looking for work as the economy continues to improve. Because of the way we measure the unemployment rate, which doesn\u2019t count people who have given up looking for work, the return of people to the labor force can have the effect of keeping unemployment high even as the economy adds jobs.\n\nRelated: The Flaws in the Federal Job Training Program\n\nYellen has argued that a considerable number of workers are still poised to return to the labor force, which means wage hikes are still likely sometime in the future. Others, who believe we are approaching full employment at a faster clip, are the ones interested in preparing for an interest rate hike.\n\nWhile Wednesday\u2019s poll finding is another arrow in Yellen\u2019s quiver, the debate is far from settled and will likely be the topic of much discussion in Wyoming this week.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Evidence continues to mount that Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s assessment of the state of the U.S. labor force, and the reason why \u201cslack\u201d remains a problem, was largely correct.", "title": "30 Percent of \u2018Retirees\u2019 Would Return to Labor Force", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/21/30-Percent-Retirees-Would-Return-Labor-Force", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10092013_Retiree_Worker_Among_Young_Workers.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/21/30-Percent-Retirees-Would-Return-Labor-Force", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/10092013_Retiree_Worker_Among_Young_Workers.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Evidence continues to mount that Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen\u2019s assessment of the state of the U.S. labor force, and the reason why \u201cslack\u201d remains a problem, was largely correct.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "If the job market tightens, wages should rise, which results in inflationary pressure on prices.\nThe issue of interest rates is tied inextricably to the job market.\nRaising interest rates is a counter to inflationary pressure.\nOthers, who believe we are approaching full employment at a faster clip, are the ones interested in preparing for an interest rate hike.\nAnd 30 percent said that, if a job became available, they would effectively \u201cunretire\u201d and rejoin the workforce."}
