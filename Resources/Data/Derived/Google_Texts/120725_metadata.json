Now let\u2019s get it right.\n\nThe Court ruled that Federal subsidies may support eligible people even if they live in states that have chosen not to set up state-specific exchanges, and have to select their insurer from the Federal exchange. The issue the Court considered was whether the exact language of the bill \u2013 providing subsidies to people buying insurance on \u201can exchange established by the state\u201d meant just that. The Chief Justice, writing for the 6-3 majority, said, \u201cIn this instance, the context and structure of the act compel us to depart from what would otherwise be the most natural reading of the pertinent statutory phrase.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,\u201d Justice Roberts reasoned. \u201cIf at all possible, we must interpret the act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter.\u201d\n\nIn the future we might see a Republican Congress vote to change the law along with a President who supports that change. But for now, we should all accept the ACA as the legitimate law of the land.\n\nIt is now time to be candid: Obamacare\u2019s intent was noble. Providing healthcare for everyone is an appropriate objective for a civil society. But the Affordable Care Act didn\u2019t quite do that. It provides for health insurance; and that is more than a bit different. The mechanism created to achieve this is, well, awkward at best.\n\nWe have heard lots of individual stories of grateful people; people who could not get health insurance because of \u201cpre-existing conditions\u201d or premiums that were simply out of reach. We have heard an equal number of tales from frustrated people who purchased exchange-based plans only to find that promised doctors and hospitals supposedly in the selected plan were not. And we\u2019ve read dozens of reports detailing the exorbitant premium price increases for people ineligible for subsidies. (There is no question that the insurance companies have done very, very well because of ACA.)\n\nHow much of the opposition to ACA was a dislike for Mr. Obama personally, partisan strategy, or ideological opposition to \u201csocialized medicine\u201d is no longer relevant. The Supreme Court has ruled twice that the ACA is Constitutional. In the future we might see a Republican President and Congress vote to change the law. But for now we should accept the ACA as a legitimate, if flawed, approach to providing health insurance And we should move on \u2013 to fix the problems and recognize that in a civil society, providing everyone with adequate health care is a legitimate role of government.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.byline_name": "The Editors", "sailthru.author": "The Editors", "application-name": "Observer", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/gettyimages-478484058.jpg?quality=80&w=640"}, "site": "@observer", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Observer"}, "sailthru.article.image.header": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/gettyimages-478484058.jpg?quality=80&w=728&h=418&crop=1", "sailthru.tags": "Affordable Care Act, Congress, government, health insurance, Law, obamacare, Supreme Court", "sailthru.section": "Opinion", "keywords": "affordable care act, congress, government, health insurance, law, obamacare, supreme court", "sailthru.article.image.grid": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/gettyimages-478484058.jpg?quality=80&w=300&h=225&crop=1", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://observer.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/dac0f3722a48a53be75eb06c0c4f5119?s=16", "news_keywords": "%tags%", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "sailthru.title": "Obamacare: It\u2019s the Law, Now Fix It", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "sailthru.byline_slug": "the-editors", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://nyoobserver.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/gettyimages-478484058.jpg?quality=80&w=50", "description": "The Supreme Court has ruled that the Affordable Care Act is legal.
