It\u2019s an important tutorial on dating, worthy of a Nobel Prize in science.\n\nIt is hard to argue with this video. First, like the manmade global warming narrative, it involves graphs and science and therefore cannot be denied. Second, the Franklin, Tenn., Alderman is wearing a sidearm and thus represents authority. The seven-minute retrospective is deep and goes a long way toward dispelling the PC clutter about male/female relationships.\n\nWe can\u2019t have substantive discussions on matters of importance in America because we are a nation full of people just waiting to be offended by something. And if they aren\u2019t offended, the liberal media are eager to tell people why they should be offended. Most of them are in Ferguson, Mo., now, fanning racial fires.\n\nIt seems everyone can produce a scientific study. One study says drinking wine and eating chocolate are good, but the next week another study says they\u2019re bad. I would think both men and women benefit when ladies drink. Alcohol lowers bad cholesterol, which is good for women, and it lowers their standards, which is good for us men. The same study determined that women who carry a little more weight live longer \u2014 certainly longer than the men who point it out.\n\nAnother study concluded that most 50,000-year-old cave art drawings were done by women, proving that, since ancient times, men have had no say in decorating.\n\nAs a gender, we men are not much. Women\u2019s expectations of us are way too high, leading to bitter disappointment upon marriage. To help manage the expectations of my two daughters, I have demonstrated over the years not to expect much from a man. Thus, they are happy now. Girls, you\u2019re welcome.\n\nThe blame for women\u2019s unrealistic expectations of men lands squarely on Hollywood\u2019s romantic comedies. For years girls have watched movies where a frumpy woman meets Hugh Grant. He is cute, listens, never married, likes to cuddle, and works in media or rescues kittens at a non-profit in New York. Yet, inexplicably, he lives in a $4 million, impeccably decorated brownstone. Yes ladies, these type of men exist. They are called gay.\n\nIn real life Hugh Grant was arrested for picking up a prostitute while dating model Elizabeth Hurley.\n\nThe guys in your office only watch ESPN and JackAss movies, sleep on a futon, have a FICO score of 2, and you do not want to look at their browser history.\n\nWomen mystify men. You ask questions like \u201cDo you love me for my brain or my looks?\u201d Don\u2019t answer, men, it\u2019s a trick! And women defy logic. We know you love garage sales. And you like lingerie. But as I found out the hard way, you don\u2019t like lingerie from a garage sale.\n\nAgain I blame the media for women giving us mixed messages. You say you want to have substantive conversations. Yet we look at what you read, like articles in Cosmo Magazine on the Affordable Care Act titled \u201cFive things about ObamaCare that will turn your man crazy in the bedroom,\u201d or \u201cHillary gives a speech on Syria in sassy new Jimmy Choo shoes.\u201d\n\nHow are we to interpret all this? \u201cWomen are from Venus, men from Mars.\u201d Aside from being able check out of a hotel room without making the bed, there are vast gender differences that government always wants to erase. Obama plays on the silly income inequality rhetoric. In his world, we all would make the same salaries, since unemployment and entitlement checks are equal. That\u2019s his dream.\n\nA guy friend of mine took the bait from his girlfriend and went to see a shrink about their relationship. (Guys, never do this; it will not turn out well.) After he spent a year and $5,000 on a psychologist on his \u201cpersonal journey,\u201d I asked him what he had learned. He found out that, deep down, he is really shallow.\n\nIn short, you cannot go wrong lowering your expectations of us and watching fewer romantic comedies. As Oscar Wilde noted after visiting the tacky Niagara Falls honeymoon hotels for the first time, it was the first of many disappointments for young brides.\n\nJust recognize that we are different, and enjoy the ride!\n\n\u25c6\u25c6\u25c6\n\nRon Hart is an op-ed humorist, author and TV/radio commentator who formerly lived in Columbia.
