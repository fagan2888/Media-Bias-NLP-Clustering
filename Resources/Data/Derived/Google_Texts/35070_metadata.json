Chaney, the memo identifies four \u201cprinciples governing the permissible scope of enforcement discretion.\u201d First, as the Court noted in Chaney, enforcement decisions should reflect \u201cfactors which are peculiarly within [the enforcing agency\u2019s] expertise.\u201d This factor would almost always seem to be satisfied.\n\nSecond, the President \u201ccannot, under the guise of exercising enforcement discretion, attempt to effectively rewrite the laws to match its policy preferences.\u201d Specifically, the memo adds, \u201can agency\u2019s enforcement decisions should be consonant with, rather than contrary to, the congressional policy underlying the statutes the agency is charged with administering.\u201d This argument reflects the backdrop of Congressional acquiescence, and the failure of the legislative branch to set any broad policies concerning immigration laws.\n\nThird, the President cannot \u201c\u2018consciously and expressly adopt[] a general policy\u2019 that is so extreme as to amount to an abdication of its statutory responsibilities.\u201d The memo continues, \u201cAbdication of the duties assigned to the agency by statute is ordinarily incompatible with the constitutional obligation to faithfully execute the laws.\u201d The \u201cTake Care\u201d clause is violated by such an abdication.\n\nThe fourth principle, which is not from Chaney, but derived from its progeny is the most important: \u201cnon-enforcement decisions are most comfortably characterized as judicially unreviewable exercises of enforcement discretion when they are made on a case-by-case basis.\u201d The memo proceeds to explain that this final factor is key: \u201ccase-by-case enforcement decisions\u201d renders non-enforcement lawful.\n\nThe most important hurdle DOJ must vault to justify the President\u2019s new executive action policy is to explain how the Administration\u2019s blanket policy of non-enforcement for those who meet certain criteria fits within Heckler\u2019s requirement for an individualized assessment.\n\nThe memo repeatedly cites Crowley Caribbean Transp., Inc. v. Pen\u0303a (D.C. Cir. 1994), which warned that \u201ca broad policy against enforcement poses special risks that [the government] \u2018has consciously and expressly adopted a general policy that is so extreme as to amount to an abdication of its statutory responsibilities.\u2019\u201d In other words, if the government adopts a \u201cbroad\u201d blanket policy of non-enforcement, there are \u201cspecial risks\u201d that it amounts to what Heckler called an \u201cabdication of its statutory responsibilities,\u201d and a possible violation of the Constitution.\n\nThe OLC memo parries this admonition, by explaining \u201cThat does not mean that all \u201cgeneral policies\u201d respecting non-enforcement are categorically forbidden. There is a difference between a \u201cgeneral policy\u201d (permissible) and \u201cbroad policy\u201d (\u201crisky\u201d business). This is the essential inquiry \u2014 are President Obama\u2019s policies with respect to DACA and IAEA \u201cgeneral,\u201d or too \u201cbroad\u201d so as to pose \u201cspecial risks.\u201d\n\nOLC must explain how these \u201cgeneral policies\u201d still entail \u201cindividualized assessments.\u201d To do this, the memo turns to Justice Scalia\u2019s 1993 opinion in Reno v. Flores. This case considered an INS policy whereby alien juveniles who were arrested without their parents would not be released into the custody of \u201cresponsible adults.\u201d The petitioners contended the INS policy amounted to a \u201cblanket\u2019 presumption of the unsuitability of custodians other than parents, close relatives, and guardians.\u201d In other words, there was no individualized assessment, and the INS was declining to enforce a statute would allow the release of the juveniles.\n\nAgreeing that there may be risks to such a policy, Justice Scalia stressed that the Attorney\u2019s General \u201cexercise of discretion \u2026 requires \u2018some level of individualized determination.\u2019\u201d But, Scalia countered, the government need not \u201cforswear use of reasonable presumptions and generic rules.\u201d In other words, applying certain types of presumptions or rules, while they may seem to be a \u201cblanket policy,\u201d are in fact forms of individualized assessment. Such approaches are not too \u201cbroad\u201d to pose constitutional problems.\n\nJustice Scalia continued, and noted that by asking a series of questions \u2014 such as whether the alien is \u201cunder 18 years of age\u201d or if he has an \u201cadult relative or legal guardian\u201d \u2014 the INS \u201cmakes those determinations that are specific to the individual and necessary to accurate application of the regulation.\u201d With these questions, Scalia concludes, \u201cthe particularization and individuation need go no further than this.\u201d\n\nDissenting from this position was Justice Stevens, joined by Justice Blackmun. Justice Stevens would reject the notion that \u201cmere presumptions\u201d satisfy the requisite individualized determination requirement: \u201ca blanket rule that simply presumes that detention is more appropriate than release to responsible adults is not narrowly focused.\u201d Stevens would require a meaningful assessment, on a case-by-case of whether an alien juvenile could be released into the custody of a \u201cresponsible adult.\u201d\n\nBased on Reno, the OLC memo explains that \u201csome \u2018general policies\u2019 may, for example, merely provide a framework for making individualized, discretionary assessments about whether to initiate enforcement actions in particular cases.\u201d This is how OLC justifies the President\u2019s new immigration policy, as well as DACA. The memo explains what approaches are permissible: \u201cGeneral policies\u201d that \u201cprovide a framework\u201d that allows the government to make \u201cindividualized, discretionary assessments\u201d about whether or not to enforce the deportation laws. The rule, if it can be so simply stated, is that applying \u201creasonable presumptions and generic rules,\u201d pursuant to a \u201cgeneral policy\u201d is permissible, so long as it involves \u201csome level of individualized determination\u201d with \u201ccase-by-case discretion.\u201d\n\nAt every step of the analysis, the memo returns to this framework. With respect to prioritization of criminals (felons over families, as the talking point goes), OLC explains that \u201calthough the proposed policy is not a \u2018single-shot non-enforcement decision,\u2019 neither does it amount to an abdication of DHS\u2019s statutory responsibilities, or constitute a legislative rule overriding the commands of the substantive statute.\u201d Why is this seemingly blanket policy not an abdication? Because it \u201cprovides a general framework for exercising enforcement discretion in individual cases, rather than establishing an absolute, inflexible policy of not enforcing the immigration laws in certain categories of cases.\u201d\n\nIn its discussion of \u201cexpansion of deferred action to new classes of aliens,\u201d OLC stresses that \u201cImmigration officials cannot abdicate their statutory responsibilities under the guise of exercising enforcement discretion.\u201d To avoid this abdication, any program should \u201cleave room for individualized evaluation of whether a particular case warrants the expenditure of resources for enforcement.\u201d\n\nFinally to rebut claims that the \u201cbreadth\u201d of the program raises \u201cparticular concerns,\u201d OLC falls back on the same line of reasoning. \u201cThe guarantee of individualized, case-by-case review helps avoid potential concerns that, in establishing such eligibility criteria, the Executive is attempting to rewrite the law by defining new categories of aliens who are automatically entitled to particular immigration relief.\u201d The last, best hope of a blanket non-enforcement policy is the appearance of an \u201cindividualized assessment.\u201d\n\nI emphasize \u201cappearance,\u201d because it is not clear the policy President Obama announced recently employs an actual \u201cindividualized assessment.\u201d While the OLC\u2019s theory seems consistent with precedent \u2014 and OLC went out of its way to do so \u2014 it remains to be seen whether the policy operates in accordance with this theory.\n\nTo use a historical example, consider President Obama\u2019s 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA). As OLC noted in their memo, they \u201corally advised\u201d the Administration that \u201cclass-wide basis would raise distinct questions not implicated by ad hoc grants of deferred action.\u201d Specifically, the memo warned that \u201cgranting deferred action automatically to all applicants who satisfied the threshold eligibility criteria\u201d would be problematic. Secretary Janet Napolitano\u2019s June 2012 memo, announcing DACA, provided that \u201cUSCIS should establish a clear and efficient process for exercising prosecutorial discretion, on an individual basis.\u201d This is very similar language to Secretary Johnson\u2019s memo.\n\nDespite paying lip service to discretion, according to a Brookings report, only 1% of applicants were denied deferrals. I could not find any explanation for why, under the capacious standards set by DHS, the denial rate was even this high. A 1% denial rate seems awfully close to \u201cautomatic\u201d relief.\n\nJustice Scalia\u2019s opinion in Reno stressed that \u201cexercise of discretion \u2026 requires \u2018some level of individualized determination.\u2019\u201d The relevant question here, is \u201cindividualized determination\u201d of what. In Reno, the discretion was based on an \u201cindividualized determination\u201d of a statute passed by Congress \u2014 whether the alien juveniles could be released to certain adults. Here, the \u201cindividualized determination\u201d is based on policies the Obama Administration itself created out of whole cloth. (As an aside about DACA, because the Dreamers did not have an independent path to citizenship, unlike the parents of U.S. Citizens under IAEA, it is unclear how the OLC\u2019s memo justifies deferring their deportation. I\u2019ll address this in a future post). Whatever deference may be owed to the statute passed by Congress, and implemented by INS in Reno, does not exist for President Obama\u2019s unilateral executive action.\n\nOLC lists the factors to consider for IAEA , as explained in a Draft Memo by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, cited in the OLC Memo (available here):\n\nSpecifically, DHS has proposed to implement a program under which an alien could apply for, and would be eligible to receive, deferred action if he or she is not a DHS removal priority under the policy described above; has continuously resided in the United States since before January 1, 2010; has a child who is either a U.S. citizen or a lawful permanent resident; is physically present in the United States both when DHS announces its program and at the time of application for deferred action; and presents \u201cno other factors that, in the exercise of discretion, make[] the grant of deferred action inappropriate.\u201d Draft Memorandum for Leon Rodriguez, Director, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, et al., from Jeh Charles Johnson, Secretary of Homeland Security, Re: Exercising Prosecutorial Discretion with Respect to Individuals Who Came to the United States as Children and Others at 4 (Nov. 17, 2014)\n\nThese factors are equally capacious as those under DACA, and are likely to yield a similar denial rate. Secretary Jeh Johnson provides absolutely no guidance of what this \u201cexercise of discretion\u201d should be, and what the grounds are for rejecting an application. This must be deliberate, as OLC felt compelled to address this absence. The memo explains, \u201cThe proposed policy does not specify what would count as such a factor; it thus leaves the relevant USCIS official with substantial discretion to determine whether a grant of deferred action is warranted.\u201d Yet, OLC still expects that officials \u201cevaluating the alien\u2019s deferred action application must still make a judgment, in the exercise of her discretion, about whether that alien presents any other factor that would make a grant of deferred action inappropriate.\u201d While this absence of guidance should create a cause for concern, OLC is satisfied. \u201cThis feature of the proposed program ensures that it does not create a categorical entitlement to deferred action that could raise concerns that DHS is either impermissibly attempting to rewrite or categorically declining to enforce the law with respect to a particular group of undocumented aliens.\u201d This is likely discretion in name only.\n\nOLC explains that \u201cSome \u2018general policies\u2019 may, for example, merely provide a framework for making individualized, discretionary assessments about whether to initiate enforcement actions in particular cases.\u201d It is unclear how this policy does anything more than pay lip service to \u201cindividualized, discretionary assessments about whether to initiate enforcement actions in particular cases.\u201d By its own terms, the President\u2019s policy seems to flunk OLC\u2019s approach. The President has in mind a group he wants to exempt from the law, and created a policy to do just that. Further, from a practical perspective, if DACA is any guide, this \u201cexercise of discretion\u201d is not particularly meaningful.\n\nWith respect to the future applications of up to 4 million immigrants, only 24 Field Offices \u2014 whose workers we are told are extremely overworked \u2014 are expected to manage all of those applications. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that this individualized assessment quickly turns into a rubber stamp. It cannot be the rule of law that the President can create criteria that automatically apply to millions, then instruct his agents to check off a few boxes that will always be checked, and call it an individualized assessment. The policy is designed to exempt everyone who correctly signs up. This is not an instance of executive discretion, but of clerical approval. Such a ministerial task seems inconsistent with the type of analysis required by Heckler.\n\nFinally, I think it is essential to separate the two types of executive action the President is taking: prioritization and deferred action. They are not the same.\n\nThe first \u2014 prioritization of deporting those who are dangerous \u2014 falls closer to traditional roles of prosecutorial discretion. But, in the usual case, once a person is not prioritized for enforcement, there are no further costs to the government (I will put aside for the moment the fact that a person who is not deported may inflict other social costs). Resources are saved, and they can be spent better elsewhere.\n\nBut here we have a one-two punch. First, the President prioritizes. Second, deferred action is offered for a large portion of those who fall outside of the priority category. Instead of simply rearranging priorities for the purpose of conserving resources with regard to one class, the policy creates a framework where brand new costs are incurred due to setting the priorities. And it is this second group \u2014 a materially larger group \u2014 that creates constitutional difficulties. The weakness of the latter aspect makes the justification for the former less plausible. In total, the President\u2019s total actions are legally lesser than the sum of its parts.\n\nBeyond immigration, the same prosecutorial discretion was used to justify non-enforcement of Obamacare. This includes the waiver for the Obamacare individual mandate (the so-called administrative fix), where anyone who \u201cbelieves\u201d that Obamacare was \u201cunaffordable\u201d would be exempt from the mandate penalty. It seems this relief was virtually automatic for anyone who asked, without any individualized assessment. Same for the employer mandate, where the Administration exempted all businesses with between 50 and 99 employees till 2016. Again, automatic. It\u2019s unclear that any businesses that met these criteria were denied.\n\nIt cannot be the rule of law that the President can create arbitrary criteria of where the law will not apply, and then exempt anyone who meets those criteria. To quote the court in Pena, this is the very type of \u201ca broad policy against enforcement [that] poses special risks [because] it \u2018has consciously and expressly adopted a general policy that is so extreme as to amount to an abdication of its statutory responsibilities.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe administrative fix is subject to a suit by the State of West Virginia, which is currently pending before D.D.C. on a motion for summary judgment. The employer mandate delay is the subject of the House of Representative\u2019s lawsuit. Both plaintiffs should amply cite the OLC memo to explain why the President lacks this discretion, with an important caveat \u2014 whatever vast discretion exists in the immigration context is not nearly as strong in health care law,which Congress has certainly not acquiesced to.\n\nAs I explain in Unprecedented: The Constitutional Challenge to Obamacare, the Solicitor General adopted the strategy of not offering a clear limiting principle about the scope of the commerce clause. The fear was that by offering a limiting principle, it would bind the government in ways they would not want to be bound in the future. The SG determined that if he was going to lose, he would rather let the Court craft a limiting principle for him. With this OLC memo, we see the wisdom of the SG\u2019s decision. By putting forth a standard that the administration may not have complied with, it has opened itself up to myriad challenges, some under way, and others to come.
