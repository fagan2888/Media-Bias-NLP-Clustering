Mark Levin: Donald Trump "Really Screwed Up This Week, Big Time, Trifecta"

Mark Levin scolds Donald Trump for his attacks on Ted Cruz, and other hypocrisies.





MARK LEVIN: I think my friend Donald Trump really screwed up this weekend, big time, trifecta. Joining in with a leftist on CNN to twist what Antonin Scalia said during a Supreme Court hearing on affirmative action, just joining in and dumping on him. He deserves better than that, a lot better than that.



Embracing ethanol subsidies. If we can’t get rid of ethanol subsidies, ladies and gentleman, how we are going to address an over $200 trillion debt. We’re not.



And then we have a guy [Ted Cruz] who has stood up to Mitch McConnell, who is viciously attacked in every liberal outlet, by the establishment, who led the fight against Obamacare, and he’s referred to as a ‘maniac.’



I’m sure Mitch McConnell loved that.



I’m sure the Wall Street Journal editorial page loved that.
