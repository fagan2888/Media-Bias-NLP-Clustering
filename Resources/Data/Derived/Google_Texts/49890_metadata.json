BRHC CEO John Dawes and CFO Jimmy Robertson spoke to council during the pre-council meeting about the financial status of the hospital.\n\nRobertson focused on Fiscal Year 2015\u2019s operating revenue over expenses (based on preliminary audit results), a significant change from Fiscal Year 2014. 2015 is expected to have an excess of roughly $5.1 million, while 2014 had a deficit of slightly more than $6 million.\n\n\u201cWe went from a losing position of approximately $6 million to a net income in \u201815 of $5 million. That\u2019s an $11 million turnaround in one year,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cAn incredible turnaround. \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of reasons why.\u201d\n\nBothwell has improved its physician documentation, allowing for an additional $1.8 million. Reliance on contract labor has also decreased, replacing most of those staff members with full-time employees, saving the hospital $850,000.\n\nChanging to a group buying network with other rural Missouri hospitals has helped Bothwell reduce costs in supplies, saving $1 million. Bothwell also closed hospice services last year, saving $270,000.\n\nWhile most of the factors in increased revenue were due to cost savings, a rate increase at Bothwell helped bring in an additional $1.9 million, although Robertson noted it is still a low-cost provider in comparison to other Missouri hospitals.\n\nThe hospital also received an additional $1.1 million, thanks to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s health insurance exchange. Of the 589 patients in calendar year 2014 who had coverage through the marketplace, about 260 of them had no coverage previously.\n\n\u201cSo, they were still using us before they had insurance, now they\u2019re using us and they have insurance. So they went from being no-pay to paying us a pretty decent rate. $1.1 million effect for those people having insurance,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cSo, I will say this, the theory of the Affordable Care Act is pretty valid \u2014 we\u2019ve seen it here in our hospital \u2014 that they\u2019re replacing self-pay and no-pay population with people that have insurance.\u201d\n\nBothwell\u2019s no-interest patient loans program, which launched last August, has proven to be successful so far. The hospital partnered with Central Bank of Sedalia to offer no-interest loans to patients to help with the burden of medical bills and high deductibles.\n\nBRHC has 364 loans with a value of $932,550, and so far only 11 loans have \u201cgone bad,\u201d Robertson said, three of which were due to the person dying before paying back the loan.\n\nCity Administrator Gary Edwards asked Robertson if this new increase in revenue was helping to keep the hospital properly staffed to meet patient needs.\n\n\u201cWe are staffing based on, in our nursing areas based on ratios of patients to nurses which are pretty much industry standards. We make sure that the units are covered,\u201d Robertson replied. \u201cWe still have a couple of contract travelers, just because we have some holes. \u2026 We have 18 (nurses) in orientation right now. Why is that? We\u2019re working to eliminate that contract labor, but we\u2019ve also had some nurses leave, so we\u2019re back filling those positions.\u201d\n\nCouncil also heard from the city\u2019s finance director, Kelvin Shaw, who presented his monthly financial update. Sales tax is down for the second month in a row \u2014 by 1.8 percent this month \u2014 which brings the city to 1.4 percent year-to-day, Shaw said, reminding council the city budgeted for a 4 percent increase this year.\n\nShaw also spoke about a $1.9 million payment to the Missouri Department of Revenue due to a miscalculation by a local business. A business, which was not named due to confidentiality laws, overpaid sales tax over a three-year period, so now the City of Sedalia, Pettis County and State of Missouri are required to pay back those funds so DOR can refund the business.\n\nThe city negotiated a three-year payment plan with DOR to decrease the impact on the city\u2019s budget. Shaw explained to council how it would be reflected in financial reports.\n\n\u201cSince we hadn\u2019t issued our audit statements or financial report yet, we have chosen, and I think appropriately so, to make a prior period adjustment,\u201d he said. \u201cSo in essence what we\u2019re going to do is restate the financial statements and the audit report like the over-payment never happened, like it wasn\u2019t ever paid to us because now we know it wasn\u2019t earned. We\u2019re going to reduce the fund balance in previous years and recognize we owe this back now to the state and ultimately to this business that overpaid.\u201d\n\nDuring the meeting council also:\n\n\u2022 Approved proposals and an ordinance approving and accepting an agreement with Louis G. Chiodini Inc. for a space-needs analysis for the Sedalia Police Department with a not-to-exceed fee of $45,700. According to information in the meeting packet, this is part of the ongoing effort to research the need for a larger police station.\n\n\u2022 Approved an ordinance amending Section 40-294 of the Code of Ordinances relating to the Firefighters\u2019 Retirement Fund Board of Trustees. This will add the finance director as a member of the board.\n\n\u2022 Approved an ordinance granting a rezoning application by Connie L. Koering, trustee of the Janice Collins Living Trust, for property located at 704 S. Montgomery Ave. If approved, this will change from R-1 single family residential to C-3 commercial district. The Planning and Zoning Commission unanimously approved this request.\n\n\u2022 Approved bids for the demolition of structures located at 916 W. Sixth St. (B&P Excavating, $8,000) and 403 W. Fifth St. (Schultz Wrecking, $8,000).\n\n\u2022 Approved a resolution authorizing a change in the September 2015 second regular meeting date of the Sedalia City Council from Sept. 21 to Sept. 28 due to the annual Missouri Municipal League Conference.\n\n\u2022 Approved a resolution amending the municipal fine and bond chart for the Sedalia Municipal Court.\n\n\u2022 Approved an ordinance amending Section 36-22 of the Code of Ordinances relating to a person failing to appear in municipal court.\n\n\u2022 Approved an ordinance imposing a use tax at the rate of 2.375 percent to the authority granted by and subject to provisions of RSMO Sections 144.600 through 144.761; providing for a use tax to be reduced or raised in the same amount as the city sales tax is reduced or raised.\n\n\u2022 Approved an ordinance to continue the application and collection of the local sales tax on the titling of motor vehicles, trailers, boats and outboard motors that were purchased from a source other than a licensed Missouri dealer.\n\n\u2022 Approved a records destruction request from the Personnel Department.\n\nAll council members were present.\n\nNicole Cooke can be reached at 660-826-1000 ext. 1482 or @NicoleRCooke.\n\nNicole Cooke can be reached at 660-826-1000 ext. 1482 or @NicoleRCooke.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\nDisqus", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-MO", "DC.language": "en_US", "DC.rights": "Civitas Media", "geo.placename": "Sedalia", "og": {"site_name": "Sedalia Democrat", "description": "Council hears report from hospitalBy Nicole Cookencooke@civitasmedia.com .neFileBlock { margin-bottom: 20px; } .neFileBlock p { margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; } .neFileBlock .neFile { border-bottom: 1px dotted #aaa; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-top: 10px; } .neFileBlock .neCaption { font-size: 85%; } http://sedaliademocrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/web1_Sedalia-city-seal4.jpg The Sedalia City Council heard two financial updates regarding the City of Sedalia and Bothwell [...]", "locality": "Sedalia", "url": "http://sedaliademocrat.com/news/2709/bothwell-revenue-increases", "image": "http://sedaliademocrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/web1_Sedalia-city-seal4-300x259.jpg", "title": "Bothwell revenue increases", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "region": "US-MO"}, "DC.type": "Text", "twitter": {"image": "http://sedaliademocrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/web1_Sedalia-city-seal4.jpg", "site": "@SedaliaDemocrat", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "- Sedalia Democrat - sedaliademocrat.com"}, "DC.format": "text/html", "DC.contributor": "Sedalia Democrat", "DC.publisher": "Sedalia Democrat", "DC.identifier": "http://sedaliademocrat.com", "DC.relation": "http://dublincore.org/", "theme-color": "#006400", "article": {"section": "News", "published_time": "2015-08-18T13:57:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-18T13:57:38+00:00", "author": "http://sedaliademocrat.com/author/englewoodindependent-2"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "DC.title": "Sedalia Democrat, Sedalia MO - www.sedaliademocrat.com"}, "article_summary": "Council hears report from hospitalBy Nicole Cooke [email protected]http://sedaliademocrat.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/web1_Sedalia-city-seal4.jpgThe Sedalia City Council heard two financial updates regarding the City of Sedalia and Bothwell Regional Health Center during Monday\u2019s meeting.\nChanging to a group buying network with other rural Missouri hospitals has helped Bothwell reduce costs in supplies, saving $1 million.\nBothwell, one of only four city-chartered hospitals in the state, is the third largest employer in the area with 775 employees.\nRobertson focused on Fiscal Year 2015\u2019s operating revenue over expenses (based on preliminary audit results), a significant change from Fiscal Year 2014.\nShaw also spoke about a $1.9 million payment to the Missouri Department of Revenue due to a miscalculation by a local business."}
