Nurses at Tri-City Medical Center Sunday called for immediate changes to management of the hospital’s emergency department to “avoid further harm to patients” and “voice alarm over operations of the hospital’s emergency department.”

A press release from the nurses at the Oceanside hospital said the emergency department is “chronically overcrowded with inadequate levels of appropriate personnel and security” and that management has “refused to take action to rectify the situation.”

“We have met with management and made concrete recommendations for improving current conditions,” said Brenda Ham, who has been a registered nurse at the hospital for 32 years. “We are now calling for immediate changes in management of the emergency department.”

The nurses will hold a news conference at noon Monday at the hospital to outline the “unsafe conditions and possible legal violations” that they have documented and reported for five months, according to the press release.

The nurses will be joined by medical device professional Jane Mitchell, a candidate in November’s election for the The Tri-City Healthcare District Board, as well as a representative of the Oceanside Firefighters Union, according to the statement.

In addition to calling for a change in management, the nurses called for more security personnel in the emergency room and the use of more certified nursing assistants.

David Bennett, the chief marketing director for the hospital, said he had not heard about the news conference and hospital officials had no comment.
