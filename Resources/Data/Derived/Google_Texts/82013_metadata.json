That\u2019s the demographic often called the most reliable progressive voting bloc. From the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections to last year\u2019s gubernatorial race in Virginia, black women can be counted on to show up at the polls. In 2012, young black women had the highest voter turnout of all voters ages 18 to 29. Black women\u2019s participation that year contributed to the turnout rate of black voters surpassing that of whites voters for the first time ever. A handful of organizations are intent on keeping black women\u2019s political participation high. ColorOfChange.org, an online civil rights advocacy organization, has launched a new campaign urging its base\u2014specifically black women\u2014to turn out. \u201cThe hope is that not only will we continue to see this upward trend in participation, but that black women will lead their families to the polls as well,\u201d Arisha Hatch, the organization\u2019s managing director of campaigns, told me. They\u2019re focusing on issues broader than just casting a ballot, like calling for a debate in the Ohio Secretary of State race and fighting disenfranchisement in Georgia, where 40,000 voter registration applications have turned up missing. Hatch said ColorOfChange will facilitate conversations on Twitter during Thursday night Scandal broadcasts in an effort to meet a critical mass of black women where they are in the weeks before the election. The Detroit-area group Mothering Justice is taking a similar approach. On Tuesday night, it will hold a conference call for black mothers about the power of their voices in the midterms. Danielle Atkinson, the group\u2019s director, said the message is especially important in Michigan, where about half the state\u2019s black residents live under emergency management and are governed by state-appointed officials. \u201cWe feel like black women have been overlooked as part of the electorate,\u201d said Atkinson, whose group is working to contact 30,000 Detroit-area registered black women and let them know about Tuesday\u2019s call. \u201cWe know that they\u2019re predictable in their voting and they\u2019re reliable, but they\u2019re so much more than that.\u201d Atkinson, too, sees black women as \u201cinfluencers.\u201d She says the path to getting black families and communities to show up at the polls is to engage women by talking to them about economic issues that effect them, like the need for paid sick days, a minimum wage increase and access to affordable childcare.
