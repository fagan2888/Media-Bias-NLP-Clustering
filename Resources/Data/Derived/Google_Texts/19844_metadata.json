If implemented correctly, kids will be college and career ready. It\u2019s just a matter of providing a robust implementation and strategies specific to Latino kids who might need additional language support.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you look at performance, it will all even out if districts and schools provide appropriate services and provide good high-quality instruction,\u201d McLeod continued. \u201cYou can\u2019t put responsibility on Latino kids or their parents.\u201d\n\nAccording to Common Core patron Bill Gates and the so-called \u201carchitect\u201d of Common Core David Coleman, the true purpose of the nationalized standards is to correct what is viewed by liberal political, education, and corporate elitists as societal injustices largely toward Hispanic and black students.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported in June, an interview with the Washington Post summarized how Bill Gates pulled off the very \u201cswift Common Core revolution.\u201d The Microsoft founder stated, \u201cThe country as a whole has a huge problem that low-income kids get less good education than suburban kids get\u2026 and that is a huge challenge.\u201d\n\nGates\u2019 statement underscored the notion that the Common Core standards initiative is a social engineering project that places education standards and testing ahead of parental and family influences as the major cause of poor student performance in low-income and minority communities.\n\nLaRaza\u2019s McLeod\u2019s statement, \u201cYou can\u2019t put responsibility on Latino kids or their parents,\u201d counters the notion of self-responsibility.\n\nSimilarly Coleman, now the College Board president, praised the collection of student data via the Common Core standards initiative at a conference in 2013, as a vehicle to reach the \u201clow-hanging fruit,\u201d or low-income and Latino students.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hispanic Media Voxxi: Hispanic Students 'Falling Behind' with Common Core Standards", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Hispanic Media Voxxi: Hispanic Students 'Falling Behind' with Common Core Standards", "title": "Hispanic Media Voxxi: Hispanic Students 'Falling Behind' with Common Core Standards - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Education/hispanic-students-classroom-ap.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2014/09/15/hispanic-media-voxxi-common-core-may-barely-be-helping-hispanic-students/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hispanic Media Voxxi: Hispanic Students 'Falling Behind' with Common Core Standards", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Big-Government/2014/Education/hispanic-students-classroom-ap.jpg", "title": "Hispanic Media Voxxi: Hispanic Students 'Falling Behind' with Common Core Standards - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bill Gates, Common Core, Washington Post,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Washington Post", "published_time": "2014-09-15T21:18:42-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca869\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s not the Common Core they\u2019re having issues with, it\u2019s the implementation of the Common Core,\u201d McLeod told Voxxi.\n\u201cKentucky is the other state that is utilizing the Common Core Standards, but results from last year\u2019s school year aren\u2019t yet available,\u201d states Voxxi.\nLaRaza\u2019s McLeod\u2019s statement, \u201cYou can\u2019t put responsibility on Latino kids or their parents,\u201d counters the notion of self-responsibility.\nSimilarly Coleman, now the College Board president, praised the collection of student data via the Common Core standards initiative at a conference in 2013, as a vehicle to reach the \u201clow-hanging fruit,\u201d or low-income and Latino students.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThough the developers and supporters of the Common Core standards have repeatedly said the purpose of the controversial education initiative is to close the achievement gap between low-income black and Hispanic and white middle-class students, an online Hispanic publication doubts that may happen."}
