The bill would prevent women from terminating a pregnancy if their child has Down syndrome, on the grounds that it\u2019s discriminatory.\n\nWhile Ohio is generally pro-life, anti-abortion activists have championed the new bill to pass sometime this fall if Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) signs it. As of now, Kasich hasn\u2019t taken a specific stance on the bill. One in every 691 babies in the U.S. are born with Down syndrome, and it\u2019s the most common genetic disorder, according to the National Down Syndrome Society.\n\n\u201cChoosing to end a person\u2019s life simply because of this diagnosis is discrimination, period,\u201d Rep. Sarah LaTourette (R ), an advocate of the bill, said. \u201cI believe that life begins at conception and that abortion is wrong. But regardless of if you agree with me or not, I hope that you can see that this isn\u2019t an issue about abortion \u2014 it\u2019s an issue of discrimination.\u201d\n\nIn the U.S. and especially in developing countries, misinformation and stigma about Down syndrome often negatively impacts those who are born with the disease, which is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. In one case, the Armenian mother of a Down syndrome infant divorced the father due to her unwillingness to keep the child, which brought the issue into the spotlight earlier this year. Currently, some 50 to 85 percent of Down syndrome pregnancies are aborted, according to a study that reviewed research between 1995 and 2011.\n\nDisability Abortions\n\nIn ethics, disability abortions are a huge gray area. There are several different arguments. One is that allowing disability as a reason for abortion would imply that disabled people are less valued or worth the effort than normal people. Others might argue that aborting a child solely on the grounds that he/she has a disability goes in line with eugenic abortions \u2014 or the desire to eliminate \u201cbad seeds\u201d or genes from the human race. Those who advocate for disability-selective abortions, meanwhile, claim that aborting a child with Down syndrome or other disabilities is for the sake of the child themselves \u2014 believing that their quality of life would be lower than that of a normal person.\n\nCritics of Ohio\u2019s proposed bill believe it is a ludicrous attempt by anti-abortion activists to enact more control over women\u2019s choices. Roe v. Wade dictates that women have a right under the 14th amendment to the Constitution to undergo an abortion \u2014 whether it\u2019s for health-related reasons, or because they\u2019re unprepared to take care of a child. It has become routine for doctors to check for congenital defects or disabilities in fetuses, then allow the parents to make the decision to either keep the baby or abort it.\n\n\u201cThese legislative proposals interfere with the doctor-patient relationship and exploit complicated issues that can arise during pregnancy in the worst way,\u201d Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, told the Cincinnati Enquirer. \u201cMedical decisions should not be made in the Statehouse, they should be made in doctors\u2019 offices based on sound medical science.\u201d\n\nIndeed, women with low-paying jobs, unstable home lives, or no education may want to undergo an abortion anyway \u2014 whether or not the child has Down syndrome. Banning all Down syndrome abortions on the assumption that it\u2019s discriminatory doesn\u2019t take into account the number of cases that are far more complex, and cases where an abortion would truly benefit the mother.\n\nPeople with Down syndrome can live normal, happy lives. Take Madeline Stuart, for example: an 18-year-old with Down syndrome whose fashion sense is top notch, and took part of New York Fashion Week this year. But banning Down syndrome abortions might not help remove the stigma or fight for disabilities rights. As one father of a child with Down syndrome wrote on CNN, \u201cIf you want to help people with Down syndrome, don\u2019t politicize their births. Instead, get to work building a more inclusive society.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "down syndrome, abortion", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Will banning Down syndrome abortions move the disabilities rights movement forward?", "title": "Ohio Moves Forward With Abortion Ban For Down Syndrome Babies", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ohio-moves-forward-abortion-ban-down-syndrome-babies-should-disability-be-factor-349246", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/24/child-down-syndrome.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Will banning Down syndrome abortions move the disabilities rights movement forward?", "title": "Ohio Moves Forward With Abortion Ban For Down Syndrome Babies", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ohio-moves-forward-abortion-ban-down-syndrome-babies-should-disability-be-factor-349246", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/24/child-down-syndrome.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/08/24/child-down-syndrome.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-08-24T17:07:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-24T17:07:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Will banning Down syndrome abortions move the disabilities rights movement forward?"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1711\"", "article_summary": "But banning Down syndrome abortions might not help remove the stigma or fight for disabilities rights.\nIn Ohio, a new bill that would ban Down syndrome abortions might soon be approved.\nWhile Ohio is generally pro-life, anti-abortion activists have championed the new bill to pass sometime this fall if Ohio Gov.\nThe bill would prevent women from terminating a pregnancy if their child has Down syndrome, on the grounds that it\u2019s discriminatory.\nAs one father of a child with Down syndrome wrote on CNN, \u201cIf you want to help people with Down syndrome, don\u2019t politicize their births."}
