It has seen its share of political swings, alternating narrow wins in presidential elections \u2014 George W. Bush only beat John Kerry by a single point there in 2004, while Barack Obama did the same against Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nThe Democratic Incumbent\n\nWhile the presidential elections have swung back and forth, incumbent congressman Tim Bishop has been able to win re-election since 2002. Bishop, who served as provost of Southhampton College before entering the halls of Congress, touts his advocacy for college access and affordability and his work in passing the College Cost Reduction and Access Act in 2007. The bill expanded student tuition assistance to families paying for college.\n\nBishop has been a reliable vote for the Democrats in Congress, voting for the Affordable Care Act and against its repeal. The website \u201cOn the Issues\u201d characterizes Bishop \u2014 based on his voting record \u2014 as a \u201cpopulist-leaning liberal.\u201d He currently serves on the congressional Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Education and Workforce Committee.\n\nIn 2012, Bishop was dogged by pay-to-play allegations that alleged he solicited a campaign contribution from hedge fund magnate Eric Semler in return for assistance expediting permits for a \u201cHamptons bar mitvah fireworks display.\u201d Bishop denied the allegations, but Semler said that he did receive a request for a donation from Bishop\u2019s campaign (specifically from Bishop\u2019s daughter and fundraiser, Molly) after Bishop helped get the permit.\n\nThe Republican Challenger\n\nBishop may meet an old foe in N.Y. State Senator Lee Zeldin, who comes to politics from a military background. Currently a Major in the Army Reserves, Zeldin served as a Military Intelligence Officer, Federal Prosecutor, and Military Magistrate while on active duty. He was deployed to the Middle East as a paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division in support of Operation: Iraqi Freedom.\n\nZeldin unsuccessfully challenged Bishop in 2008. Six years later, Zeldin returns to run again. This time, he is as a rising conservative star, having unseating Brian Foley from the State Senate in 2010. In Albany, Zeldin led the charge to repeal the MTA Payroll Tax on employers and sponsored legislation to enact the nation\u2019s strongest property tax cap, which was signed into law by Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\nAs one would guess, Zeldin has also sponsored legislation benefiting veterans, securing funding to help returning veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and sponsoring a law that would prevent protests at military burials.\n\nThe Wildcard\n\nBefore Zeldin can look to a second showdown with Bishop, he will have to win a primary against two-time candidate George Demos. A former SEC prosecutor, Demos ran for Congress in 2010 and 2012, losing a primary in the former and withdrawing from the latter.\n\nBut, this does not mean that Demos should be taken lightly.\n\nHe recently claimed to have over $2 million in his campaign coffers, mostly from loans he personally made to his campaign. The source of the funds has become a matter of controversy in Republican circles. N.Y. Republican Chairman Ed Cox called Demos\u2019 campaign \u201cpolitical malpractice\u201d while blasting him for allegedly using his father-in-law\u2019s money and his connections to U.S. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.\n\nDemos\u2019 campaign, of course, denies any such connection.\n\nReading the Political Tea Leaves\n\nIn the last few election cycles, a few trends have emerged. Overall, the volatility of voter turnout for the NY-1 election between presidential election cycles and mid-term elections is notable. Anywhere from 60,000 to 100,000 voters stay home during mid-term elections in NY-1 simply because the presidency was not at stake. Voter turnout in mid-term elections has been on the rise in the last two cycles.\n\nCongressman Bishop is a battle-tested incumbent, but his margin of victory has dwindled since 2006. In fact, Bishop was nearly unseated in the Republican resurgence of 2010 when it took months of re-counts and court proceedings to win. Bishop did do better against the same opponent in 2012 with President Obama at the top of the ticket. However, it seems clear that a well-funded candidate with the name recognition that Zeldin possesses could pose an even bigger threat to Bishop\u2019s job than his 2010 challenge.\n\nFor State Senator Zeldin, the challenge seems obvious: get past the primary with enough money on hand to win. Given the tenor of Demos\u2019 past campaigns (his 2010 primary battle turned negative and degraded until the primary election) and the aggressive posture that the Republican establishment has taken early on, a fierce primary is on the horizon. Zeldin just needs to win and have cash to spare, because he has already shown he can unseat Democratic incumbents.\n\nDemos is the fly in the Republican ointment. In a primary, lack of establishment support makes a win an uphill climb. Couple that with his past unsuccessful attempts at politics, and primary voters may be left with a negative impression. But, Demos\u2019 cash on hand can be used to nullify these challenges. How he spends it will determine whether he has any shot.\n\nIf recent history is any judge, the nation\u2019s eyes will once again be fixed on the eastern end of Long Island for yet another protracted political tangles.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tim Bishop may be in the fight of his life as NY-1 is arguably one of the most competitive 2014 New York elections and perhaps the most competitive...", "og": {"site_name": "IVN.us", "description": "Tim Bishop may be in the fight of his life as NY-1 is arguably one of the most competitive 2014 New York elections and perhaps the most competitive...", "title": "All Eyes Are on New York's First Congressional District in 2014 - IVN.us", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 475, "identifier": "http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tim-Bishop.jpg", "height": 356}, "updated_time": "2014-01-27T07:14:43-07:00", "url": "http://ivn.us/2014/01/27/eyes-new-yorks-first-congressional-district-2014/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tim Bishop may be in the fight of his life as NY-1 is arguably one of the most competitive 2014 New York elections and perhaps the most competitive...", "creator": "@gberardelli", "image": "http://ivn.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Tim-Bishop.jpg", "title": "All Eyes Are on New York's First Congressional District in 2014 - IVN.us", "site": "@IVN", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2014-01-27T07:14:36-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 322111017868621, "pages": 233116802464}, "keywords": "New York, elections, Tim Bishop, Lee Zeldin, Congress, congressional races, competitive elections, 2014 elections", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IVN", "published_time": "2014-01-27T07:14:36-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/gberardelli", "section": "Campaigns", "modified_time": "2014-01-27T07:14:43-07:00", "tag": "Tim Bishop"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "congress, elections, lee zeldin, new york, primaries, tim bishop, politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6549\"", "article_summary": "Paid AdvertisementA historical battleground congressional district in New York is set once again for another knock-down, drag-out election season.\nDemos\u2019 campaign, of course, denies any such connection.\nNew York\u2019s First Congressional District, comprised of the central part and the eastern end of Long Island, includes affluent playgrounds like the Hamptons, working class neighborhoods like Smithtown and Mastic, and rural farming communities on the North Fork.\nOverall, the volatility of voter turnout for the NY-1 election between presidential election cycles and mid-term elections is notable.\nBishop has been a reliable vote for the Democrats in Congress, voting for the Affordable Care Act and against its repeal."}
