Steele fell, Miranda raised both arms and the estimated 700 people in attendance inside the Kodiak Island Fairgrounds pavilion went wild.\n\nThat was the shortest of seven fights during the inaugural Havoc MMA1 event. If you blinked, you missed it.\n\n\u201cI wanted to end it quickly, but I didn\u2019t think it would be that quick,\u201d said Miranda. \u201cI just landed that lucky shot.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the only one to land a few shots. Zach Ward pummeled Josh Goss in one of the first fights of the evening. Ward said he wanted a first-round victory, but was pleased with finishing his opponent by submission in the second round.\n\nThis was Ward\u2019s first time in the cage, but it wasn\u2019t his first time grappling. He has been wrestling since a kid and wrestled at the 1/2/3A state tournament while at Craig High School.\n\n\u201cI wanted to see what I had,\u201d said Ward, who added 20 pounds to his 180-pound frame leading up to the fight. \u201cI had never done anything like this. I\u2019m just a natural warrior, hard worker and just wanted to put myself to the test.\u201d\n\nWard and Miranda were not the only winners as Steven Gauna, Sean Costello, Sam Loggins, Jaron Steele and Matt Ivanoff all picked up victories.\n\nGauna, a former Kodiak running and wrestling star, defeated Ryan Gabor in the third round by submission.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot of fun,\u201d Gauna said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I have ever felt an adrenaline dump like that ever in my life.\u201d\n\nSean Costello, a two-time state champion wrestler for Kodiak, won by unanimous decision over Arky Garcia. Costello used his wrestling background and controlled the match on the ground.\n\nSam Loggins led the night off with a first-round victory over John Sousa, while Jaron Steele earned a first-round submission win over Josh Cislo-Welter.\n\nWhile mostly everybody was making their inaugural appearance in the cage, it was the final one for Danger Bay logger Butch McGavran. It didn\u2019t end well for McGavran as Ivanoff won by submission in the first round of the main event.\n\nAfter battling a drug addiction his entire life, McGavran turned to MMA in 2008 at the age of 40. The sport took him all over the United States as he fought 14 professional fights and more than 12 amateur bouts before returning to Danger Bay several years ago.\n\nMay 30 was his first fight in four years and the last in his career.\n\n\u201cIt was a fun ride,\u201d McGavran said. \u201cI enjoyed it.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Kodiak (Alaska) Daily Mirror, http://www.kodiakdailymirror.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Jeff Miranda trained four months for his debut in mixed martial arts fighting.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Jeff Miranda trained four months for his debut in mixed martial arts fighting.", "title": "Havoc MMA debuts in Kodiak", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/7/havoc-mma-debuts-in-kodiak/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/05/1d55195ef2366118780f6a7067009177.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/05/1d55195ef2366118780f6a7067009177.jpg", "description": "Jeff Miranda trained four months for his debut in mixed martial arts fighting.", "card": "summary", "title": "Havoc MMA debuts in Kodiak"}, "Author": "DEREK CLARKSTON", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "article_summary": "Steele fell, Miranda raised both arms and the estimated 700 people in attendance inside the Kodiak Island Fairgrounds pavilion went wild.\nSam Loggins led the night off with a first-round victory over John Sousa, while Jaron Steele earned a first-round submission win over Josh Cislo-Welter.\nKODIAK, Alaska (AP) - Jeff Miranda trained four months for his debut in mixed martial arts fighting.\nGauna, a former Kodiak running and wrestling star, defeated Ryan Gabor in the third round by submission.\nAfter battling a drug addiction his entire life, McGavran turned to MMA in 2008 at the age of 40."}
