He needs one. Soon. In a sport that can be as frustrating as it is beautiful, even the strongest of wills can survive only so long without tangible reasons to smile.\n\n\u201cThe most fundamental aspect of team is winning. And winning is the one thing you can\u2019t control,\u201d Mastroeni told me Thursday. \u201cYou can control the preparation, the planning, the player selection and the tactics. You can control all those things. What you hope as coach, in order to validate you as a coach, is you do all those things and in doing those things, you get results. That makes you a good manager or a bad manager.\u201d\n\nNo matter how you cut it for any coach, and particularly for an unproven coach, it all comes down to scoreboard, baby.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the scoreboard. And that\u2019s what defines you,\u201d said Mastroeni, nodding in agreement. \u201cBut knowing that, you can\u2019t say: \u2018Guys! I need you to win this game for me.\u2019 \u201c\n\nOne signature victory could shake the Rapids from the most unproductive stretch of soccer in franchise history. One signature victory could provide a strong signal that Mastroeni, the most decorated player to wear a Colorado uniform, can transfer his unquestioned brilliance on the pitch to consistent success on the sideline.\n\nThe Rapids have won two consecutive games for the first time in more than a calendar year, after a recent switch to a more aggressive 4-3-3 formation awakened a moribund offense. About time, don\u2019t you think? During what has been a red-hot summer for soccer in America, with record-breaking television ratings for the women\u2019s national team during the World Cup, the Rapids have largely been a dud, outside of their usual Fourth of July fireworks.\n\n\u201cThe mentality has to be: \u2018We have to win every game.\u2019 And the preparation has to be as such,\u201d Mastroeni said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going in (a game) and playing reserved; it\u2019s not going and waiting for our moments. It\u2019s going in with no doubt that we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d\n\nSince being named coach prior to the opening of the 2014 season, Mastroeni has built the foundation of a strong defense but has little to show for his efforts, winning only a dozen times in 53 games. That\u2019s as inept a stretch as any in franchise history; even during a bad run of 54 games from 2001-02, the Rapids won 18 times.\n\nWith a roster in transition, too often it has appeared as if Mastroeni tries to win every game 1-nil. The Rapids of Mastroeni have seldom been out of any game, but have more rarely put the fear of defeat in foes. The young coach\u2019s team knows how to tie. All those old ties, however, eventually get thrown in a dusty corner of the closet, while you sit at home and watch other teams in the playoffs.\n\nThere is nothing but the utmost respect here for the passion and skill Mastroeni exhibited as a holding midfielder, whether as an MLS all-star with the Rapids or as a member of the USMNT. But I had to ask: Has Mastroeni been too conservative, too reserved and not creative enough as a coach?\n\n\u201cFrom my experience as a player, I understood that a great defensive foundation provides the attacking players with enough confidence and enough structure to allow them to express themselves,\u201d Mastroeni said. \u201cThe toughest thing in soccer is to strike that balance. And what allows you to strike that balance is results.\u201d\n\nThe long slog of the MLS regular season means the playoff hunt is never over until math pushes a team off the end of the table, even if you\u2019re in last place, where the Rapids sit now.\n\nSo here\u2019s the chance for a signature win. This weekend, the Rapids travel to play the first-place Sounders in Seattle, a place where Colorado has never won.\n\nIs this mission impossible?\n\n\u201cListen, we\u2019ve played Seattle two times this year and both games I felt like in good portions of those games we were the better side and just didn\u2019t capitalize on some opportunities,\u201d Mastroeni said. \u201cGoing into Seattle on the heels of two good performances and two good results is the best time we\u2019ve had this year to capitalize on momentum against a top team at the top of the table and start to turn things around.\u201d\n\nBig opportunity doesn\u2019t knock. It must be seized. Therein lays the beauty of a signature win. It can make a struggling team believe in itself, and a city believe in an un- proven coach.\n\nMark Kiszla: mkiszla@denverpost.com or twitter.com/markkiszla", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kiszla: Pablo Mastroeni needs big win as coach of Rapids", "title": "Kiszla: Pablo Mastroeni needs big win as coach of Rapids", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/07/16/kiszla-pablo-mastroeni-needs-big-win-as-coach-of-rapids/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-16T20:16:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T11:56:34+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc190\"", "article_summary": "COMMERCE CITY \u2014 More than 50 games into his tenure as Rapids coach, Pablo Mastroeni is searching for that first signature victory.\nTherein lays the beauty of a signature win.\nSo here\u2019s the chance for a signature win.\nWith a roster in transition, too often it has appeared as if Mastroeni tries to win every game 1-nil.\n\u201cThe mentality has to be: \u2018We have to win every game.\u2019 And the preparation has to be as such,\u201d Mastroeni said."}
