- Members of the Clinton family made the rounds in Michigan on Sunday ahead of the Democratic presidential debate.

Both former President Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea Clinton made stops in the Detroit area.

Bill appeared at Sunday services on Detroit's west side and addressed the congregation at Greater Grace Temple. He said he was proud of his wife Hillary and thought she would do well in the debate.

Meanwhile, former first daughter Chelsea Clinton also spent part of her day in Metro Detroit. She met with Service Employees Union members, union members of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, then attended an economic forum in Southfield.

Chelsea talked about her mother's resolve in fighting for universal health care, which helped lead to the Affordable Care Act. She said she had to sit for many of the events today because of her pregnancy with her second child. She said becoming a mother has helped her to pay extra close attention to the race for the presidency.
