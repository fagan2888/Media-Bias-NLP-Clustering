But judging by the early reactions, Republicans are going to be haunted by it for a long time.\n\nTo recap: Before the August recess, the House Republicans passed a bill to deal with the influx of unaccompanied immigrant minors at the southern border. To secure the conservative support they needed to get it passed, the leadership held a vote on a second bill to eliminate funding for DACA (conservatives argue that the program helped cause the border crisis, even though there\u2019s little reason to believe that\u2019s true).\n\nSince then, Republicans have been catching it hot from immigration activists. This past weekend, Rep. Paul Ryan was at a book signing in Florida where he was confronted by several young people claiming to be beneficiaries of DACA. They wanted to know why Ryan had voted with Rep. Steve King and other hard-line anti-immigrant legislators to terminate the program. Ryan dodged the questions and instead urged them to read his book.\n\nIt was actually the second time in the past week that Ryan\u2019s book tour was met by protests from immigration activists.\n\nPaul Ryan\u2019s run-in with DACA beneficiaries follows Steve King\u2019s heated encounter from earlier this month in Iowa, in which a young undocumented immigrant invited King to tear up her identification card. Sen. Rand Paul famously fled the scene of that confrontation before it escalated, but last week he told reporters that he actually sides with King on the issue and supports the House bill.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Immigration activists confront Ryan over his anti-DACA vote -- and it's only going to get worse for the GOP VIDEO", "title": "Paul Ryan is the latest Republican to get an earful on immigration", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Immigration activists confront Ryan over his anti-DACA vote -- and it's only going to get worse for the GOP VIDEO", "title": "Paul Ryan is the latest Republican to get an earful on immigration", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/08/25/paul_ryan_is_the_latest_republican_to_get_an_earful_on_immigration/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/paul_ryan5.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Immigration activists confront Ryan over his anti-DACA vote -- and it's only going to get worse for the GOP VIDEO", "title": "Paul Ryan is the latest Republican to get an earful on immigration", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/08/paul_ryan5.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Comprehensive Immigration Reform, DACA, Deportation, Dream Act, Immigration, Immigration Reform, Paul Ryan, Rand Paul, Steve King, Video", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd03c\"", "article_summary": "They wanted to know why Ryan had voted with Rep.
