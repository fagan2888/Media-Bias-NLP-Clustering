On Tuesday, in what the retiring congresswoman from Minnesota figured would be her last White House holiday party, Bachmann used the grip-and-grin moment when she got her picture taken with President Obama to raise a reliably grin-killing topic. \u201cThe U.S. needs to take out Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities today,\u201d she informed him.\n\nHis response?\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cA condescending smile and laugh,\u201d she tells Politico, making a little pat-on-the-head gesture. \u201c\u2018Michele, it isn\u2019t that easy, but that\u2019s OK,\u2019\u201d she remembers him telling her. To which the gentlelady from Minnesota replied that it would be on him, then, to have failed to keep Iran from wiping Israel off the map.\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nBachmann, who, amid a probe into possible campaign finance violations during her 2012 presidential run, announced last year that she would not seek a fifth term, put a lot of thought into that final \u201csubstantive word with the president,\u201d as she puts it, even if it did make her the holiday guest from hell. \u201cI made the conscious decision I was going to run hard through the tape at the end\u201d of her time on the Hill, she said in a long interview in the borrowed committee room where her staff has been camped out since they packed up her office before Thanksgiving. And using even those few seconds with Obama in the most provocative possible way is just one reason the 58-year-old firebrand feels \u201clike an accomplished person\u201d as she exits stage right.\n\n\u201cI feel almost like my life is over, in a positive way,\u2019\u2019 she says.\n\nBachmann, after all, came to Washington to fight\u2014and she did, summoning thousands of tea partiers to protest at the Capitol, questioning the president\u2019s patriotism, and \u201ctirelessly,\u201d to use one of her favorite words, painting the Affordable Care Act as downright deadly: \u201cLet\u2019s repeal this failure before it literally kills woman, kills children, kills senior citizens,\u2019\u2019 she once argued from the House floor.\n\nOne of the first to tap into the deep vein of discontent and distrust among those who identify with the tea party, she reveled in taking on her own party, too, even opposing the auto bailout supported by President George W. Bush, who had campaigned for her back when she was, as she said in her final floor speech this week, \u201cessentially nobody from nowhere.\u201d In 2011, she gave the \u201ctea party response\u201d to Obama\u2019s State of the Union speech\u2014in competition with the official GOP rejoinder.\n\nDuring her presidential run, she won an Iowa straw poll, briefly becoming a front-runner as well as a punchline, and unmistakably moved the debate to the right. She leaves a far more conservative Republican caucus than the one she joined in January of 2007. And with her congressional battles behind her, she leaves, she says, a happy woman.\n\nIn a mocking salute on Hardball with Chris Matthews on Thursday night, the MSNBC host called her \u201cqueen of the hard right-wing clown car,\u201d and showed a blooper reel of her incorrectly claiming that the HPV vaccine causes developmental delays, airbrushing American history by insisting that our nation\u2019s founders \u201cworked tirelessly \u2019til slavery was no more in the United States,\u2019\u201d and locating the battle of Lexington and Concord in New Hampshire rather than Massachusetts. Al Sharpton ran a similar tape that showed her mispronouncing \u2018chutzpah\u2019 and vowing that \u201cPresident Bachmann will allow you to buy any light bulb you want,\u201d a reference to her bill, the Lightbulb Freedom of Choice Act, which pushed back against Democratic attempts to phase out energy-inefficient incandescent light bulbs.\n\nYet not unlike liberal House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Bachmann genuinely seems to see most criticism as proof that she\u2019s effectively \u201ccontending.\u201d When I spent time with her as she was campaigning for the presidency in Iowa late in 2011, I came away thinking the key to understanding both her personal and political perspective is that she sees adversity as redemptive, and life itself as one hell of a fight.\n\nMichele Marie Amble was formed more than anything, she always says, by the poverty her family had to work its way out of after her parents divorced when she was 13. Their family fell on such hard times, she regularly said on the campaign trail, that her mom had to sell her pretty wedding china for pennies from a card table she set up in their driveway. Nobody gave her anything she didn\u2019t earn, she always said, and from a young age had to work to pay for \u201cmy clothes and my glasses and if I wanted lunch at school; that\u2019s life.\u201d Again in the interview this week, she cited that struggle as one that ended up being \u201cgood training.\u201d\n\nIt certainly made her who she is as a parent who raised her five kids to fend for themselves. For one thing, they never got an allowance: \u201cWe told them, \u2018We\u2019re not paying you to breathe.\u2019\u201d Instead, because they lived on a golf course, they grew up harvesting golf balls, washing them and selling them back to the golfers, and then moved on to other part-time jobs as they got older. They also grew up knowing that they would mostly have to work their way through college, as Bachmann and her husband, Marcus, had done. (The result, she brags, is that the last two graduated last spring, none has any debt, and none is living in her basement. \u201cWe didn\u2019t smother them, we weren\u2019t helicopter parents, and now we can be free.\u201d)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO Magazine", "description": "After moving the GOP to the right, what will she do next?", "title": "Is This the End of Michele Bachmann?", "url": "http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/12/michele-bachmann-final-days-113542.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/12/12/141213_henneberger_bachmann_ap.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Congress,2014 Elections,Michele Bachmann,Politics,Minnesota", "twitter": {"site": "@politicomag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politicomag"}, "description": "After moving the GOP to the right, what will she do next?", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf7d3\"", "article_summary": "Should anyone have been surprised that Michele Bachmann would go out with a bang, a big bang?\nThey also grew up knowing that they would mostly have to work their way through college, as Bachmann and her husband, Marcus, had done.\nOn Tuesday, in what the retiring congresswoman from Minnesota figured would be her last White House holiday party, Bachmann used the grip-and-grin moment when she got her picture taken with President Obama to raise a reliably grin-killing topic.\n\u201c\u2018Michele, it isn\u2019t that easy, but that\u2019s OK,\u2019\u201d she remembers him telling her.\nMichele Marie Amble was formed more than anything, she always says, by the poverty her family had to work its way out of after her parents divorced when she was 13."}
