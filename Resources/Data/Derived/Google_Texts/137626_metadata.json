Perez told The Detroit News that labor unions in countries like Mexico would improve work conditions and stop a trend of U.S. manufacturers \u2014 including Detroit automakers \u2014 from moving jobs there.\n\n\u201cWe need to address the concerns and the structural deficiencies that make it harder for people to organize,\u201d he said Tuesday in an editorial board meeting with The News. \u201cIf you address those things... then you create a situation where you can raise the standard of living for Mexican workers...then the dynamic of manufacturing going over there because it\u2019s cheaper will change.\u201d\n\nGlobal automakers have announced more than $25 billion in investments in new plants and expansions in Mexico, which is now the world\u2019s fourth-largest auto exporter. Most of the vehicles, built by workers making as little as $9 an hour, are coming to the United States. About 70 percent of Mexican-built vehicles are exported.\n\nPerez said labor provisions in countries like Mexico, Vietnam and others are part of long-running talks aimed at reaching a 12-nation Asia Pacific free trade deal.\n\n\u201cOur North Star is what do we do to best protect the American worker?\u201d Perez said.\n\nPerez said talks are ongoing in Washington over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s so-called \u201cCadillac Tax,\u201d which starting in 2018 imposes a 40 percent excise tax on the portion of group health insurance premiums that exceed $10,200 for single coverage and $27,500 for family coverage.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re continuing that conversation,\u201d Perez said.\n\nPerez was in Detroit on Tuesday to continue his national \u201cShared Prosperity for a Stronger America\u201d tour as he addresses advocates of a $15 minimum wage. Los Angeles voted in May to hike its minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2020 \u2014 joining San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle and other large cities.\n\nPerez said he planned to meet for dinner with Mayor Mike Duggan on Tuesday to discuss how the government could help continue to match workers with jobs. One avenue to do that, he said, was increasing apprenticeship programs to skilled trades jobs.\n\n\u201cApprenticeships are like the other college, without the debt,\u201d Perez said. \u201cWe\u2019re building career pathways.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1JkvZBm", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Thomas Perez says unions there could convince manufacturers to not send jobs south", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "Thomas Perez says unions there could convince manufacturers to not send jobs south", "title": "Labor chief: Mexico union growth would help U.S.", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2015/08/25/labor-secretary-detroit/32362347/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thomas Perez says unions there could convince manufacturers to not send jobs south", "title": "Labor chief: Mexico union growth would help U.S.", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/af42e0004b2e926217d490e2b500e5c9c287affb/c=831-0-4169-3338&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/25/DetroitNews/B99299807Z.1_20150825192307_000_G96IT8P3.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Labor Secretary, Tom Perez, Mike Duggan, Detroit"}, "article_summary": "Perez said labor provisions in countries like Mexico, Vietnam and others are part of long-running talks aimed at reaching a 12-nation Asia Pacific free trade deal.\nMost of the vehicles, built by workers making as little as $9 an hour, are coming to the United States.\nPerez said he planned to meet for dinner with Mayor Mike Duggan on Tuesday to discuss how the government could help continue to match workers with jobs.\nPerez was in Detroit on Tuesday to continue his national \u201cShared Prosperity for a Stronger America\u201d tour as he addresses advocates of a $15 minimum wage.\n\u201cOur North Star is what do we do to best protect the American worker?\u201d Perez said."}
