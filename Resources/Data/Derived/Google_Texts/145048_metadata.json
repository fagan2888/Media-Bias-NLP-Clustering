We need to pick up seats in the House,\" he said. Obama was re-elected in 2012.\n\nObama's tone at the fundraiser was more subdued than the earlier rally-like event in Michigan, which occurred before a shooting at the Fort Hood Army base in Texas. In between fundraisers in Chicago, Obama told reporters he was \"heartbroken\" about the shooting and pledged to get to the bottom of what happened.\n\nBefore that, however, Obama spent the day in campaign mode.\n\nIn Ann Arbor, with his shirt sleeves rolled up and his suit jacket off, Obama noted 7.1 million people had signed up for coverage under Obamacare, his signature healthcare law, which has dogged him for months because of a disastrous rollout and a glitchy website.\n\nThen he pressed his case for raising the national minimum wage to $10.10, a move Republicans oppose. Obama said the move would lift millions of people out of poverty.\n\n\"Republicans in Congress don't want to vote to raise it at all. In fact some want to scrap the minimum wage,\" he told the crowd of mostly young people, who proceeded to boo.\n\n\"No, no, don't boo. Organize,\" he told them. \"They may not hear the boos, but they can read a petition and they can see votes.\"\n\nCAMPAIGN MODE\n\nObama needs the votes in November to help thwart Republicans, who see an opportunity to build on their majority in the House and take control of the Senate.\n\nA Republican-controlled Congress would make it far more difficult for Obama to pass items from his agenda during his last two years in office.\n\nOne hope of the Democrats is Representative Gary Peters, who is running for a Senate seat in Michigan.\n\nAlthough many Democrats have shied away from campaigning with Obama because of the unpopularity of the healthcare law, Peters joined the president on Wednesday. Obama bought him a sandwich at the popular local deli, Zingerman's.\n\n\"I'm happy to be with the president. I work with the president on issues that are important to middle-class families here in Michigan and families who aspire to be in the middle class,\" Peters told reporters. \"I'm pleased to be with him and really pleased that he's focused on Michigan.\"\n\nWith a large blue banner declaring \"Opportunity for all\" and a big American flag, the gym had the feel of the campaign venues Obama frequented as a candidate in 2008 and 2012.\n\nHis words had a similar ring as well. The president hammered Republicans for opposing his ideas and made clear that, despite its problems, he believes Obamacare is a winner for his party and a problem for the opposition.\n\n\"They do have one original idea, which is to repeal Obamacare,\" Obama said of Republicans. \"Because they haven't tried that 50 times.\"\n\nAnd he was sharply critical of a Republican proposal offered on Tuesday by Representative Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee, that would reduce government spending by $5 trillion over a decade.\n\nObama said the type of cuts required of the Ryan budget would be devastating to middle-class voters.\n\n\"If they were trying to sell this sandwich at Zingerman's, they'd have to call it the Stinkburger, or the Meanwich,\" he said.\n\n(Additional reporting by Steve Holland and Mark Felsenthal in Washington; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Jeff Mason", "Author": "Jeff Mason", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "On a politically focused trip aimed at revving up his base and raising cash, President Barack Obama on Wednesday urged supporters to help Democrats keep control of the U.S. Senate and declared this year to be his last campaign.", "title": "Worried about Senate, Obama calls 2014 his last campaign", "image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20140402&t=2&i=876226446&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=CBREA311L0D00", "creator": "@Reuters", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
