He's made following these players across the county a full-time job.\n\n\"I enjoy being around the golf course, around the golfer,\" said Peter Maurer.\n\nYou could call Maurer from Plano, Texas another journeyman.\n\n\"I've done all opens, the men's and women's and seniors'. I did the PGA, Kiawa and I've done a Ryder Cup.\"\n\nOut here Maurer won't swing a club, but he will raise his arms.\n\n\"I just enjoy doing it.\"\n\nHe enjoys it so much so that the retired salesman follows the tour, volunteering for nine events a year, sometimes more. The US senior open will be his 49th event\n\nMaurer is thrilled to be here. At the US open in Pinehurst a few weeks ago he had to stay 40 minutes from the course. This week he's nine minutes away.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "The US Senior Open officially starts Monday with practice rounds.
