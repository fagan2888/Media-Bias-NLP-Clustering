John Kasich and Sen. Marco Rubio. Sen. Ted Cruz won his home state of Texas in the deluge of Super Tuesday contests.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nTrump thanked Louisiana resident Willie Robertson of Duck Dynasty fame, then cited a CNN poll that puts the GOP frontrunner at 49 per cent in the state. He then remarked that Rubio, Cruz,and Kasich came in far behind him.\n\n\u201cMaine is looking really good and Louisiana is looking really good. I tell ya we have about a 20 point lead,\u201d Trump told the exuberant crowd before urging those gathered that they must come out and vote.\n\nVoters in four states will head to polls or caucuses on Saturday to register their vote in the GOP presidential nomination process. Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Maine will decide whether to support Trump, Cruz, Rubio, or Kasich in closed primaries.\n\n\u201cMovements are no good if you lose,\u201d Trump declared. \u201cWe have a movement and we\u2019ve gotta win, but we\u2019ve gotta win big.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am just the messenger. We\u2019re in this together,\u201d Trump said drawing on his increasing focus on painting himself as a uniter and not a divider.\n\nOn Thursday morning, 2012 failed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney held a highly promoted, last minute speech from Utah in which he assailed frontrunner Trump on issue after issue. The speech echoed the words of Rubio with phrases like, \u201cHere\u2019s what I know: Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud. His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University.\u201d\n\nTrump called Romney a choke artist to his Louisiana audience, a name he has also called this cycle\u2019s establishment leader, Rubio. \u201cHe\u2019s upset because when he sees this happening, he never had it happening with him.\u201d Trump said of Romney\u2019s 2012 bid. \u201cIt was a race that should\u2019ve been won, remember that, and he gave up,\u201d Trump added. President Barack Obama won re-election over Romney in the 2012 race.\n\n\u201cMillions of people are going out to vote that never gave a d**n before,\u201d Trump went on to declare. \u201cYou look at Alabama, how do we love Alabama, alright? Tennessee.\u201d\n\nThe primary voter turnout numbers have been remarkable, with increases in 2016 over 2012 of 386 percent in Virginia, 261 percent in Arkansas, and 154 percent in Tennessee.\n\nTrump said, \u201cWe are going to win against Hillary Clinton so easily.\u201d He continued speaking of the general election should he become the Republican nominee: \u201cWe\u2019re going to win Michigan\u2026. For the other guys, Michigan is not in play.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a shot at winning New York. Can you imagine what would happen if we won New York? Republicans do not even campaign in New York, it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s over, it\u2019s done. A lot delegates obviously, it\u2019s New York. New York loves Trump. Remember, New York values. Ted Cruz was knocking the h**l out of \u2018em. It\u2019s good stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna win Pennsylvania. We\u2019re gonna win Virginia. We\u2019re going to win Florida. We\u2019re gonna win Ohio,\u201d Trump predicted.\n\n\u201cMississippi, do I love Mississippi? Well we\u2019re gonna probably win Mississippi anyway, but we love Mississippi right? But you know I\u2019m talking about places that the Republicans don\u2019t have a chance of winning. They wouldn\u2019t even think in terms of Michigan, they wouldn\u2019t think in terms of New York. And you look at the kind of polling numbers. Hillary cannot even come close to me in Michigan. And in New York we\u2019re going to give her an awfully big run.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew York has been let down. Ya know upstate New York, they didn\u2019t allow them to frack. And the place loves Trump.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed that if fracking were allowed in New York, there would be lower taxes and no debt and the state would have made a fortune. Instead, he said, Pennsylvania took all of that money.\n\nTrump also took the opportunity to laud some of his most conservative endorsements ahead of Saturday\u2019s voting, including Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), former Vice Presidential nominee and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, and Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona.\n\nHe emphasized to the cheering crowd the opportunity to grow his volume of support. \u201cWe\u2019re not capped, because people are coming out of the Democrats and they\u2019re coming into our party. And they\u2019re coming out of the independents and we\u2019re blowing it through the lid,\u201d he said.\n\nThere were also the regular Trump rally protest interruptions, where the GOP frontrunner throws the protester or protesters out of the rally and relishes getting press cameras to show the size of the crowd.\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Trump in Louisiana: Millions Voting \u2018That Never Gave a D**n Before\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Trump in Louisiana: Millions Voting \u2018That Never Gave a D**n Before\u2019", "title": "Trump in Louisiana: Millions Voting \u2018That Never Gave a D**n Before\u2019 - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/Trump-New-Orleans-AP-PhotoGerald-Herbert.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/03/05/trump-in-louisiana-millions-voting-that-never-gave-a-dn-before/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trump in Louisiana: Millions Voting \u2018That Never Gave a D**n Before\u2019", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/03/Trump-New-Orleans-AP-PhotoGerald-Herbert.jpg", "title": "Trump in Louisiana: Millions Voting \u2018That Never Gave a D**n Before\u2019 - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "caucus, Donald Trump, Florida, GOP, Hillary Clinton, John Kasich, Kansas, Louisiana, Marco Rubio, Mississippi, New York, ohio, Pennsylvania, primary election, republican, Ted Cruz, Tennessee, virginia, Willie Robertson,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Donald Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-03-05T13:45:53-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Willie Robertson", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "\u201cMillions of people are going out to vote that never gave a d**n before,\u201d Trump went on to declare.\nKansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, and Maine will decide whether to support Trump, Cruz, Rubio, or Kasich in closed primaries.\nTrump said, \u201cWe are going to win against Hillary Clinton so easily.\u201d He continued speaking of the general election should he become the Republican nominee: \u201cWe\u2019re going to win Michigan\u2026.\n\u201cIt was a race that should\u2019ve been won, remember that, and he gave up,\u201d Trump added.\nThe speech echoed the words of Rubio with phrases like, \u201cHere\u2019s what I know: Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud."}
