Mike Pence is waiting for word about his proposed Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0 \u2013 a replacement for an expansion of traditional Medicaid \u2013 and could make an announcement about its approval in a speech scheduled for Tuesday.\n\nBut members of the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus said the state has been waiting too long to provide care to low-income Hoosiers. The issue is part of a larger agenda the caucus unveiled Monday.\n\n\u201cOther states have gone ahead and adopted the Affordable Care Act,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Brown of Gary, the ranking Democrat on the House Public Health Committee. \u201cBut we are hesitant because of the philosophy of the governor that individuals should participate financially in that.\u201d\n\nPence wants to change and expand the state\u2019s existing Healthy Indiana Plan in place of a Medicaid expansion. The plan requires participants to contribute financially to the program, a provision the U.S. Health and Human Services Administration has opposed. The Pence administration and federal officials have been in talks about the plan since July.\n\nPence hoped the decision would be made in time to launch the plan Jan. 1. That didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe black caucus said that while Pence \u201cdawdles on an expansion\u201d of the Healthy Indiana Plan, thousands of Hoosiers have gone without care.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to wait any longer,\u201d Brown said.\n\nPence has scheduled a speech for 10 a.m. at the St. Vincent Ruth Lilly Conference Center at the Marten House, 1801 W. 86th Street, in Indianapolis. The governor\u2019s office has not said what the speech will be about but it will be broadcast live online at http://webinar.isl.in.gov/indiana/.\n\nOn Monday, the black caucus chairman, Sen. Lonnie Randolph, D-East Chicago, laid out several other proposals regarding education, economic development, and criminal and social justice.\n\nSen. Earline Rogers, D-Gary, said, \u201cA lot of the eyes will be on education\u201d this session. She said the state needs to boost funding for school foundation grants, which are the floor on which funding is based.\n\n\u201cIf we increase the foundation dollars then all schools \u2013 whether you\u2019re public, private, whatever \u2013 will get the money that they need,\u201d said Rogers.\n\nRogers has authored a bill that would require that public schools provide materials at no cost to students. Rogers said that if the education system is going to ask students to do more, that those students should be provided with the tools to do so.\n\nAlong with health care and education, members of the caucus have authored bills about bias-motivated crimes, racial profiling, school discipline, small business and even a bill that would establish a commission with the hopes of attracting a professional sports franchise to northwest Indiana.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hopeful that a lot of the areas we\u2019re concerned with will at least have some dialogue some discussions about and will hopefully be passed in terms of bills,\u201d Randolph said.\n\nJess Seabolt is a reporter for TheStatehouseFile.com, a news website powered by Franklin College journalism students.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd978a\"", "article_summary": "The black caucus said that while Pence \u201cdawdles on an expansion\u201d of the Healthy Indiana Plan, thousands of Hoosiers have gone without care.\nBut members of the Indiana Black Legislative Caucus said the state has been waiting too long to provide care to low-income Hoosiers.\nIndiana Black Legislative Caucus from TheStatehouseFile.com on Vimeo.\nMike Pence is waiting for word about his proposed Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0 \u2013 a replacement for an expansion of traditional Medicaid \u2013 and could make an announcement about its approval in a speech scheduled for Tuesday.\nOn Monday, the black caucus chairman, Sen.
