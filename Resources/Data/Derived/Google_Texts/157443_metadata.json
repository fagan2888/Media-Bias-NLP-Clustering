But a new report from the Congressional Research Service challenges economic arguments that are being made to justify repealing the tax.\n\nCritics of the tax say it is destroying jobs and encouraging manufacturers to move operations overseas. Repealing it is a priority for Republicans on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut in its report, the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, said that many of the concerns were unfounded.\n\nThe effects on jobs, research and company profits are \u201crelatively modest,\u201d the report said. As a result of the tax, it estimates, 47 to 1,200 workers could lose their jobs. They account for one one-hundredth to two-tenths of 1 percent of jobs in the industry.\n\n\u201cThese relatively modest effects occur partly because the tax is relatively small,\u201d the report said.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nIn addition, it said, \u201cinnovation and research would be minimally affected.\u201d\n\nThe tax, which took effect in 2013, is equal to 2.3 percent of the sale price of a medical device and is expected to raise $29 billion over 10 years. It applies to products like X-ray machines, magnetic resonance imaging scanners, pacemakers, artificial hearts and artificial hip and knee joints.\n\nMost of the tax will be passed on in the form of higher prices, the report said, but \u201cthe effect on the price of health care will most likely be negligible because of the small size of the tax and small share of health care spending attributable to medical devices.\u201d\n\nThe effects on output and profits of medical device companies will also be minor, the report said.\n\nStudies commissioned by the medical device industry project larger effects, with a loss of 30,000 to 40,000 jobs or more. But the Congressional Research Service said the authors of these studies had often overlooked the fact that \u201cabout half of output is exempt from the tax.\u201d\n\nThe law exempts eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids and other devices that are \u201cpurchased by the general public at retail for individual use.\u201d These include pregnancy test kits, adhesive bandages, wheelchairs and portable oxygen concentrators.\n\nTax-exempt products in the American market account for about 20 percent of the industry\u2019s production, the report said. Sales of devices for export are also exempt, and they account for 38 percent of output, it said.\n\nSenator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, strongly supports the repeal of the tax and said he trusted data from device manufacturers showing that it was \u201ca job-killer.\u201d Leading Democratic proponents of repeal include the senators from Minnesota, which is home to a thriving device industry. Last week, on the first day of the new Congress, Representative Erik Paulsen, Republican of Minnesota, introduced a bill to repeal the tax, and it immediately gained 258 co-sponsors, including 29 Democrats.\n\nThe House passed legislation to repeal the tax in 2012, in 2013 and again in September. The Senate endorsed repeal as part of a nonbinding budget blueprint that it adopted in 2013.\n\nPresident Obama has threatened to veto legislation to repeal the tax, in part because its passage could embolden those who are trying to roll back other taxes and fees that finance coverage under the health care law. Whether Congress would sustain a veto is unclear.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe Advanced Medical Technology Association, a trade group, said the analysis by the Congressional Research Service was fundamentally flawed.\n\n\u201cIt simply ignores the facts of what is happening in the industry,\u201d said David H. Nexon, the association\u2019s senior executive vice president. \u201cAll over the country, companies are reporting layoffs or forgone hiring for tens of thousands of workers as a result of the tax.\u201d\n\nA survey by the industry shows that one-third of medical device companies have reduced their research budgets in response to the tax, Mr. Nexon said.\n\n\u201cPatients will be the losers,\u201d he said, because they will have fewer lifesaving and life-enhancing treatments.\n\nSupporters of the tax said that device manufacturers, like insurers and drug companies, stood to benefit from the expansion of coverage. But the medical technology association said the increase in demand for devices so far \u201cappears to be small or nonexistent.\u201d\n\nRepublicans said the tax had encouraged device companies to shift jobs and production operations overseas. But the report said that \u201cthe tax should have no effect on production location decisions, since both domestically manufactured and imported medical devices are subject to the excise tax.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150113123427, "twitter": {"description": "A report by the Congressional Research Service found that many concerns among medical device manufacturers about a tax under the Affordable Care Act were unfounded.", "title": "New Analysis Challenges Arguments for Repealing Tax on Medical Devices", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/us/tax-has-modest-effects-on-medical-device-makers-report-says.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003446912"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/14/us/HEALTH/HEALTH-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/us/tax-has-modest-effects-on-medical-device-makers-report-says.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003446912", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/us/tax-has-modest-effects-on-medical-device-makers-report-says.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "New Analysis Challenges Arguments for Repealing Tax on Medical Devices", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Jan. 13, 2015", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "Congressional Research Service", "keywords": "Medical Devices,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Federal Taxes (US),Congressional Research Service", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/14/us/HEALTH/HEALTH-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "A report by the Congressional Research Service found that many concerns among medical device manufacturers about a tax under the Affordable Care Act were unfounded.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/14/us/HEALTH/HEALTH-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "A report by the Congressional Research Service found that many concerns among medical device manufacturers about a tax under the Affordable Care Act were unfounded.", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Jan. 13, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2015-01-14", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Congressional Research Service", "published": "2015-01-13", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "14health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20150114155823, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/us/tax-has-modest-effects-on-medical-device-makers-report-says.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/14/us/HEALTH/HEALTH-facebookJumbo.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "A report by the Congressional Research Service found that many concerns among medical device manufacturers about a tax under the Affordable Care Act were unfounded.", "title": "New Analysis Challenges Arguments for Repealing Tax on Medical Devices"}, "pdate": 20150113, "des": "Federal Taxes (US)", "articleid": 100000003446912, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "New Analysis Challenges Arguments for Repealing Tax on Medical Devices", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda6e4\"", "article_summary": "But a new report from the Congressional Research Service challenges economic arguments that are being made to justify repealing the tax.\nStudies commissioned by the medical device industry project larger effects, with a loss of 30,000 to 40,000 jobs or more.\nBut the report said that \u201cthe tax should have no effect on production location decisions, since both domestically manufactured and imported medical devices are subject to the excise tax.\u201d\nPhotoWASHINGTON \u2014 A tax on medical devices, imposed by the Affordable Care Act, has become a prime target for Republicans, some Democrats and a small army of lobbyists for the industry.\nThe effects on jobs, research and company profits are \u201crelatively modest,\u201d the report said."}
