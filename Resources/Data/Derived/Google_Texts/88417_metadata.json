STORIES MAKING A DIFFERENCE. STORIES THAT MATTER TO YOU. THIS IS KETV NEWSWATCH 7'S CHRO NICLE. THEY WANTED ME TO PURCHASE IN THE ELECTRONICS DEPARTMENT AT THEY WANTED ME TO KEEP THAT ITEM, WHATEVER IT WAS, AND I GOT $400 COMMISSION. SO I THOUGHT, WHY NOT? TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. IT'S A SURE SIGN OF A SCAM OR DECEPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES. BUT THERE'S HELP OUT THERE TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT THE NEXT VICTIM. GOOD MORNING, I'M ROB MCCARTNEY AND WELCOME TO KETV NEWSWATCH 7'S CHRONICLE. THIS MORNING, WE'RE TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SCAMS, TALKING WITH BOTH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AND THE COORDINATOR OF OUR \"7 CAN HELP\" HOTLINE. THE FACT IS, FINDING THE RIGHT BUSINESS TO DO BUSINESS WITH IS TOUGH. IT'S HARD TO KNOW WHO TO TRUST. CONSIDER THIS -- NEBRASKA ALONE, THOUSANDS ARE TARGETED BY SCAMS EVERY YEAR, COSTING THEM MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. MORE THAN $3.1 MILLION. WHILE A LOT OF SCAMS FOCUS ON SENIORS, SOME CON-ARTISTS ARE CHANGING UP THEIR GAME. KEEPING UP WITH THE LATEST TRENDS IN TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL MEDIA. USING SITES LIKE TWITTER, INSTAGRAM AND FACEBOOK TO ENTICE YOU. THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU SAYS THAT'S HOW DOZENS IN THE METRO ARE LOSING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. ONE VICTIM HOPES OTHERS CAN LEARN FROM HER MISTAKE. SHE EXPLAINED WHAT HAPPENED WITH KETV NEWSWATCH 7'S CHINH DOAN. IT SAID YOU GET PAID $500 A WEEK TO HAVE A WRAP ON YOUR CAR. A PROMISING AD ON FACEBOOK CAUGHT KYLIE BLACK'S ATTENTION. THE 19-YEAR-OLD THOUGHT LETTING A COMPANY COVER HER CAR UP WITH DECALS WOULD MAKE HER MONEY WHEN SHE REALLY NEEDED IT. I HAVE SEEN OTHER ADVERTISEMENTS ON OTHER CARS, SO I FIGURED IT WOULDN'T BE SUCH A BAD THING TO HAVE IT ON ME. KYLIE SIGNED UP AND GOT A \"CHECK\" FOR $1,900. THE COMPANY TOLD HER TO CASH IT AND SEND $700 TO A SO-CALLED \"DECAL SPECIALIST.\" SO SHE DID, BUT THEN -- CALLED ME AND TOLD ME IT WAS FROUD. KYLIE IS PART OF A YOUNGER GENERATION CROOKS ARE TARGETTING ONLINE. IT WAS PRETTY AWFUL. I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY $700 TO MY BANK. JIM HEGARTY WITH THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU SAYS SCAMMERS KNOW JUST ONE POST, ONE CLICK CAN GET YOUNG ADULTS HOOKED. BEFORE SHE EVEN FIGURES OUT THAT THE CHECK IS GOING TO BOUNCE AND THAT SHE HAS BEEN VICTIMIZED, IT IS POSSIBLE SHE COULD HAVE SHARED THIS POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY WITH HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. LOOKING BACK, KYLIE SAYS SHE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN NO LEGITIMATE BUSINESS WOULD COMMUNICATE ONLY THROUGH EMAILS AND TEXTS. THE GRAMMAR, IT WAS ALWAYS OFF. THERE WASN'T MISSPELLING CONSTANTLY. GOOD WAS LIKE THEY ARE TRYING TO TYPE TOO FAST. NOW QUICKLY LEARNING -- IF IT SOUNDS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT LIKELY IS. WE WERE PRETTY NAIVE TO A LOT THATS GOING ON. WE STILL NEED TO LEARN A LOT, AND BEING SCAMMED WILL DEFINITELY TEACH YOU A LOT. THERE'S A LOT TO LOOK OUT FOR. IT CERTAINLY IS. THAT WAS CHINH DOAN REPORTING. IF YOU'RE HIT BY A SCAM, REPORT IT BOTH TO POLICE AND THE BETTER AND JOINING US NOW FROM THE BBB, JIM HEGARTY. THANKS FOR BEING HERE. FIRST OFF, WHAT ARE THE CHANCES A VICTIM LIKE HURT HER MONEY BACK? -- LIKE KYLIE GETS HER MONEY BACK? ALMOST NONE. MOST OF THESE SCHEMES ARE BEING PERPETRATED OFFSHORE, JAMAICA, EUROPE, EASTERN EUROPE. WE HAVE A VERY LITTLE COOPERATION WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THOSE COUNTRIES, WHICH IS WHY DOES SCAMMERS OPERATE THEIR SCHEMES FROM THEIR. -0 - FROM THERE. YOU HAVE TO STOP AND GIVE THIS A THOUGHT IN ADVANCE. HELP US SORT THROUGH AN OPPORTUNITY THAT CAN LOOK LEGITIMATE. THEY CAN HIJACK THE TRADEMARKS OF MONSTER OR KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN TO LOOK LEGITIMATE. IT LOOKS VERY BELIEVABLE AND THE SCAMMERS HAVE GOTTEN BETTER WITH THEIR GRAMMATICAL ERRORS THAT WOULD BE THE TIP-OFF IN THE PAST. ARE SCAMS FAIRLY POPULAR OR FREQUENT? NONSTOP, THERE IS NOT A WEEK THAT GOES BY WHERE WE GET DOZENS OF CALLS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE RECEIVED OFFERS LIKE THIS. THERE ARE THE LOW-TECH PHONE CALL SCAMS PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING RIGHT NOW ALTHOUGH FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT SOUNDS LIKE THEY ARE FROM AN OFFICIAL FROM THE IRS, TELLING YOU THERE IS AN ISSUE WITH TAXES, YOU HAVE TO MAKE A PAYMENT OR YOU WILL BE SUBJECT TO ARREST -- THEN WE , WHERE PEOPLE ARE RESPONDING TO THESE OPPORTUNITIES ONLINE. RANSOM WARE, THAT LOOKS OF COMPUTERS AND CELL PHONES. REALLY, THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE OPERATING THESE GIMMICKS ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE SOPHISTICATED. MANY OF THEM ARE BASED ON FEAR, ESPECIALLY TALKING ABOUT THE OLDER POPULATION. THAT IS RIGHT. IF YOU COME HOME AND HAVE A MESSAGE ON YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT IS FROM THE IRS TELLING YOU THAT THERE IS POTENTIAL THAT YOU COULD BE ARRESTED IF YOU DON'T REACH OUT TO THEM RIGHT AWAY FOR I THINK THAT IS THE BOTTOM LINE. THEY USE THESE TACTICS. IT IS DELIVERED AND DESIGNED TO SET UP THEIR VICTIMS STAGE BY STAGE TO HOPEFULLY GET SOME MONEY OUT OF THEM. THE BBB HAS BEEN BUSY, WE OF PEOPLE YOU'VE HELPED IN THE PAST FEW YEARS. THE NUMBER KEEPS GOING UP. IT IS NOT QUITE DOUBLED OVER FOUR YEARS, BUT GETTING CLOSE. WHY DO YOU HAVE -- WHY ARE YOU HOPING 70 PEOPLE? ARE YOU DOING A BETTER JOB, OR ARE THERE MORE SCAMS OUT THERE? WE ARE A VERY WELL RESOURCED ORGANIZATION. WE INVEST A LOT OF MONEY IN INFRASTRUCTURE. WE TRY TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE THROUGH OUR MARKETING EFFORTS TO REACH OUT TO US IN ADVANCE BEFORE THEY MAKE A DECISION TO DO BUSINESS. WE ARE RECEIVING ON AN ANNUAL BASIS, EVIDENCE OF REQUIRES THE CONSUMING PUBLIC WHO ARE DOING JUST THAT -- THEY ARE CONTACTING US FIRST. THAT IS A GOOD THING. THAT HELPS PEOPLE MAKE BETTER AND MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT WHO IT IS THEY WILL DO BUSINESS WITH. THE OTHER THING IS THAT THERE IS STILL A SIGNIFICANT EROSION OF TRUST IN OUR COUNTRY. I AM NOT SURE WE HAVE FULLY RECOVERED FROM EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN THE GREAT RECESSION. THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE STILL CAUTIOUS. I THINK THAT IS A GOOD THING IN THE WAY THAT THEY SPEND THEIR VERY HARD-EARNED MONEY. IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH. THE BBB IS DOING A BETTER JOB HOPEFULLY, BUT ABSOLUTELY THERE IS STILL A BROKEN TRUST IN OUR COUNTRY. I THINK THAT IS FOR VERY GOOD REASONS. WE HAVE A FEW MORE GRAPHS TO SHOW PEOPLE. IT LOOKS LIKE SERVICE ORIENTED INDUSTRIES -- ROOFING, CONSTRUCTION, INSURANCE, JEANETTE MARKETING, GENERAL CONTRACTORS. PLUMBING, AUTO REPAIR, HOME BUILDERS. IS IT BECAUSE THEY ARE SERVICE ORIENTED THAT THEY ARE MORE COMMON? A LOT OF THESE HIRING INQUIRING INDUSTRIES REQUIRE BIG EXPENDITURES. IF YOU ARE GOING TO REMODEL YOUR HOME, OR HAVE A NEW ROOF, IT COULD COST $1500. PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE CATASTROPHIC HEALTH NO DOUBT. BEFORE THEY MAKE THAT LARGE EXPENDITURE, THEY CHECK THE COMPANY AND MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A GOOD RECORD. ONE OF THE ISSUES WE DO SEE IS THAT WE GET A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT COMPANIES IN ON THEIR INDUSTRIES THAT PEOPLE DON'T THINK TO INQUIRE ON. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE MAKING A PERSON -- MAKING A PURCHASE, IF YOU ARE HIRING A PERSON OF ANY KIND, IT ONLY TAKES A MOMENT TO GO TO BBB.ORG AND WE CAN CONNECT YOU TO FANTASTIC INFORMATION TO FIND THE REST BUSINESSES TO CODE OF BUSINESS PRACTICE THAT GETS YOU ASSURANCE DOWN THE ROAD POTENTIAL PROBLEMS. WE HAVE ANOTHER LIST THE TOP 10 TO GET COMPLAINTS ABOUT. NEW CAR DEALERS, USED CAR DEALERS, HOME WARRANTIES, SECURITY SYSTEMS -- IT IS INTERESTING THE ONLY THREE INDUSTRIES THAT SHOW UP ON BOTH OF THOSE WITH. -- BOTH OF THOSE LISTS. IT IS INTERESTING. SOMETIMES THIS FLUCTUATES FROM YEAR-TO-YEAR. ONE YEAR, IT MIGHT BE CELL PHONE COMPANIES. A LOT OF PEOPLE GET BILLS AND DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. THEY CALL US AND WANTS TO FILE A COMPLAINT. THE BOTTOM LINE FOR PEOPLE IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE COMPLAINT VOLUME WE RECEIVED -- AND WE ONLY TAKE 11,000 COMPLAINTS EACH YEAR -- A LOT OF THOSE COULD BE AVOIDED IF FOLKS REACH OUT TO US IN ADVANCE AND GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THEM MAKE A MORE INFORMED DECISION FROM THE BEGINNING. YOU GET SO MANY CALLS ON THE SENIOR LINE. EXPLAIN WHAT THAT IS. SO MANY OF THESE SCHEMES OCCURRING TODAY DO TARGET OUR ELDER POPULATION. A LOT OF THE OFFSHORE SCAMMERS KNOW THAT THEY ARE SITTING DUCKS. THEY ARE AT HOME, THEY HAVE DISPOSABLE INCOME, AND THE SCAMMERS ARE HOPING THAT PERHAPS THEY ARE AT AN AGE WHERE MAYBE THEY ARE BECOMING COMPROMISED IN SOME OF THEIR DECISION-MAKING, COULD BEAT WIDOWS OR WIDOWERS -- COULD BE WIDOWS OR WIDOWERS. WE HAVE LIFE OPERATORS STANDING BY ON A PHONE LINE ANYTIME THEY HAVE CONCERN ABOUT AN OFFER. ESPECIALLY IF SOMEONE SHOWS UP AND SAYING THEY CAN PUT SEALANT ON YOUR DRIVEWAY, OR RECEIVING A NOTICE IN THE MAIL THAT THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A SWEEPSTAKES -- WE WANT THEM TO TAKE A MOMENT, TAKE A BREATH, AND REACH OUT TO US AT THE BBB AND HELP DETERMINE IF THAT IS LEGITIMATE. THAT IS HARD TO DO. SO MANY SENIORS ARE SO TRUSTING. IF YOU COME TO THE DOOR AND SAY I WANT TO FIX YOUR GUTTERS, THEY WILL SAVE, YOU ARE THE EXPERT. FIX MY GUTTERS OR WHATEVER. WE DON'T WANT THEM TO DO THAT. HOW DO YOU GET THAT MESSAGE TO THEM CANNOT DO THAT? WE HAVE BEEN HITTING THAT HARD. WE HAVE INVESTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO REACH OUT TO SENIORS, GET THEM TO CALL US. AND THEY DO CALL US. IF YOU HAVE A LOVED ONE IN THAT MARKETPLACE, REACH OUT TO THAT THEY ARE. WE WILL SEND THEM A SENIOR MAGNET AND INFORMATION TO HELP THEM BE MORE INFORMED CONSUMERS. WE HAVE A FEW SECONDS LEFT. WE HAVE FRAUD 201 COMING UP. 8:00 EMBASSY SUITES, IT IS GOING TO BE A GREAT PROGRAM ON WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN PREVENT BECOMING A VICTIM OF FRAUD. IT IS FREE OF CHARGE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. GREAT VENUE, PRETTY EASY TO GET TO. 8:00 TO 10:00 AT THE EMBASSY SUITES. WE'LL HAVE INTERNATIONAL SPEAKERS TO HELP PEOPLE DO A BETTER JOB AT WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. ONE OF THE SPEAKERS IS AN IDENTITY THEFT VICTIM HERSELF. SHE WAS, AND NOW SHE RUNS A RESOURCE CENTER OUT OF SAN DIEGO. VERY RENOWNED IN THIS INDUSTRY. WE HAVE GREAT CONTENT. WE'LL HAVE COFFEE. A NICE OPPORTUNITY. AGAIN, APRIL 18 IN AN BUSY SUITES. GOOD ADVICE IS ALWAYS. TIME FOR US TO TAKE A SHORT BREAK. EMPOWERING TO YOU TO TAKE ACTION. WE'RE TALKING WITH THE MEN OF OUR OWN HOTLINE. WELCOME BACK TO KETV NEWSWATCH 7'S CHRONICLE. THIS MORNING, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO AVOID BEING TAKEN. FOR THREE DECADES, \"7 CAN HELP\" HAS BEEN RIGHT HERE BY YOUR SIDE. HELPING SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS, GETTING RESULTS, AND CALLING OUT COMPANIES WHO ARE LESS THAN REPUTABLE. JOINING US NOW IS THE COORDINATOR OF 7 CAN HELP, LARRY THOMPSON. HE HAS BEEN THE COORDINATOR FOR YEARS NOW. WELCOME AND GOOD MORNING. FOR THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW, EXPLAIN HOW 7 CAN HELP WORKS. OUR GOAL IS TO EMPOWER PEOPLE TO SOLVE THEIR PROBLEMS. NOT FOR US TO PICK UP THE PHONE AND SOLVE THE PROBLEM, BUT TO GIVE THEM THE RESOURCES TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. WE HAVE NO NUMBERS OF MAJOR CEOS -- PHONE NUMBERS OF MAJOR CEOS AND COMPANIES IN TOWN. WE CAN CUT THROUGH THE RED TAPE, WE CAN GET IN THESE NAMES AND PHONE NUMBERS TO GET THE PROBLEM SOLVED. YOU HAVE HELPED A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE LAST YEAR. I THINK WE HAVE A GRAPHIC SHOWING HOW MANY PEOPLE. WE ARE SHOWING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. WE HAVE AN EXCELLENT STAFF OF VOLUNTEERS WHO COME IN EVERY DAY TO SOLVE PROBLEMS, ANSWER E-MAILS COME AND TO GET BACK WITH EVERYBODY. WE ARE REALLY PROUD THAT WE CAN HELP EVERYBODY IN THE METRO AREA EVERY DAY. EMERGENT'S VIEWS, MAIL, INTERNET, TELEPHONE SCAMS, LANDLORD ISSUES -- THAT IS A HUGE ONE. THAT IS A HUGE ONE. A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE MOLD IN THEIR APARTMENTS AND HOMES, BEDBUGS, P FLEAS. THESE FOLKS PANIC, AND THROW EVERYTHING OUT. THERE HAVE TO DO THAT THERE ARE CHEMICALS AND PROCESSES THAT CAN GET RID OF UIT. THESE VOLUNTEERS ARE THE UNSUNG HEROES. MANY VOLUNTEERS HAVE BEEN HERE MORE THAN 20 YEARS. THEY DON'T WANT TO LEAVE BECAUSE THEY ENJOY HELPING THE PEOPLE. THESE ARE BULLDOGS. THEY DON'T HESITATE TO CALL EIGHT CEO OF ANY MAJOR COMPLETE AND SAY \" WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THIS CLIENT OR PERSON?\" I SIT BACK AND THEY DO THE WORK. THOSE BULLDOGS, IF YOU WILL, TO HAVE THAT ADVOCATE ON YOUR SIDE. IT IS LIKE HAVING YOUR MOM ON YOUR SIDE SAYING \"LISTEN SONNY.\" THAT IS WHAT THEY DO. HOW DO YOU HELP PEOPLE GET RESULTS? YOU MAKE PHONE CALLS, IS IT AS SIMPLE AS THAT? MANY COMPANIE S, UTILITY COMPANIES FOR EXAMPLE. MISTAKES ARE MADE IN SOME CASES. WE WILL LOOK AT THE BILL, GET THE OTHER PEOPLE ON THE LINE. WE CAN DO A THREE WAY CALL. WE WANT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENED. THAT IS WHAT WE DO. WE WANT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. YOU BRIEFLY MENTIONED THE IRS SCANDAL GOING AROUND. THEY CALLED ME TWICE. WITH THIS NEW SOPHISTICATED SYSTEM THEY ARE USING, THEY DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO ANYBODY. THEY ARE WAITING FOR YOU TO CALL THEM BACK. WHEN YOU GET A CALL LIKE THAT, IT IS A LITTLE INTIMIDATING. IF YOU REALLY FEEL LIKE YOU DID MISS THIS LETTER COMING IN, CALL THE IRS. IS LISTED IN THE PHONE BOOK. WE HAVE THEIR PHONE NUMBER. :, AND I DID THAT. LETS JUST SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING. THEY SAID EVERYTHING WAS CLEAR. DON'T PANIC, JUST CALL THEM BACK. ONCE YOU CALL THEM BACK, YOU ARE ON THEIR LIST AS A POSSIBLE SOCCER. DO-- POSSIBLE SUCK ER. NUMBER IN THE PHONE BOOK OR JUST CALL YOU. EITHER ONE. THEY PICK UP THE PHONE AND WILL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE GETTING IS HE WITH TAX TIME. I SEE YOU HAVEN'T PHONES FROM THREE DIFFERENT ERAS. EXPLAIN WHY. ONE OF THE BEST FEATURES IS CALLER ID. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER THE TELEPHONE IF YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE WAS CALLING. CELL PHONES NOWADAYS HAVE CALLER ID TILDEN. -- ID BUILT IN. YOU CAN BUY A CONTRAPTION LESS THAN 20 BUCKS, YOU CAN GETS TO THE END OF YOUR PHONE AND IT TELLS YOU WHO IS CALLING. MANY NUMBERS: FROM SCAMS HAVE A -- NUMBERS CALLING FROM SCAMS HAVE A 000 NUMBER. GOOD YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE IT, DON'T ANSWER. -- IF YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE IT. IF YOU ARE CONSISTENTLY GETTING CALLS, YOU MAY NEED TO TAKE HER -- FURTHER STEPS AND CALL YOUR PROVIDER. WE ARE GLAD TO WALK PEOPLE THROUGH THAT PROCESS. YOU GET A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT MILEAGE. WHAT ARE YOU HEARING? A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL PURCHASE A CAR AND WILL DRIVE IT OFF THE LOT AND LITERALLY HAVE AN ISSUE. I HAD ONE PERSON ENJOYS A BLOCK AWAY FROM A USED CAR LOT AND LITERALLY THE CAR STALLED. IT WAS SOLD AS IS. YOU NEED TO TAKE PRECAUTIONS BEFORE YOU BUY. I DON'T CARE IF IT IS $500, $5,000, YOU NEED TO KNOW WHAT YOU ARE PURCHASING. YOU NEED TO TAKE IT TO WRITE DIAGNOSTIC CENTER, HAVE A MECHANIC TAKE A LOOK AT IT. IS A BIG INVESTMENT. WHAT CAN YOU DO IN THIS KIND OF SITUATION? WE ARE NOT AFRAID TO CALL THE DEALER. WE ARE NOT AFRAID TO CALL THE PERSON SELLING THE CAR AND SAY THE VEHICLE. WHAT CAN BE WORKED OUT FROM THIS SITUATION? WE ALSO REFER A LOT OF PEOPLE TO AGENCIES. FOR CARS, IT IS THE AUTOMOBILE LICENSING BOARD. IF YOU SELL MORE THAN EIGHT CARS A YEAR, YOU HAVE TO BE ON THEY ARE VERY STRICT ON WHAT THEY CAN SAY AND CAN'T SAY AND HOW THEY CAN MARKET THE CAR. THERE A VERY GOOD AT FOLLOWING UP.

REMEMBER, WE LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU. WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WELCOME BACK TO KETV NEWSWATCH 7'S CHRONICLE. WITH THE TIME REMAINING, WE WANT TO UPDATE YOU ON A TOPIC WE COVERED A FEW WEEKS AGO ON LAST WEEK, A FEDERAL JUDGE RULED SAME SEX COUPLES COULD START GETTING MARRIED. BUT THURSDAY EVENING, THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS SAID NOT SO FAST. I EXTENDING NEBRASKA'S BAN UNTIL AN APPEAL IN THE CASE IS DECIDED. THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT WILL HEAR ARGUMENTS MAY 12 IN OMAHA, COMBINING SEVERAL CASES DEALING WITH THE SAME SEX MARRIAGE ISSUE. IN HIS INTIAL RULING, JUDGE JOSEPH BATAILLON SAID \"IT IS TIME TO BRING THIS UNEQUAL PROVISION TO AN END.\" RIGHT AFTER THAT OPINION HIT, GOVERNOR PETE RICKETTS CALLED BATAILLON AN ACTIVIST JUDGE. AND NEBRASKA'S ATTORNEY GENERAL VOWED TO DEFEND STATE LAW. DOUG PETERSON SAYS HE'S GLAD THE COURT GRANTED THE STAY BECAUSE IT PROVIDES STABILITY IN NEBRASKA'S MARRIAGE LICENSING PROCESS. I DON'T THINK WE CAN DICTATE OUR LAWS BASED UPON THE EMOTIONAL ARGUMENT OF A CERTAIN CLASS OF PEOPLE. WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE PROPER CONSTITUTIONAL PROCESS. I DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE DECIDED BY THE PREFERENCES OF ONE JUDGE. THIS IS AN ISSUE FOR THE PEOPLE OF NEBRASKA. THE ACLU RESPONDED, SAYING THEY'RE DISAPPOINTED BUT WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT. WHILE NEWS OF THE STAY IS A BLOW TO SAME SEX COUPLES WHO WERE HOPING TO GET MARRIED ON MARCH 9 AS WE DISCOVERED, THE BAN NEVER STOPPED HUNDREDS OF PASTORS FROM PERFORMING HUNDREDS OF SAME SEX WEDDINGS. THE STATE, AND IT COULD BE A WHILE NOW BEFORE THAT CHANGE HAPPENS. THERE'S OVER 300 LISTED CLERGY IN THE AREA THAT WILL DO SAME-SEX WEDDINGS IN SUPPORT OF SAME-SEX COUPLES. I AM REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE REALITY THAT PEOPLE ARE INTERPRETED GOD'S LOVE IN A WAY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE NEW IT WAS AMAZING THAT IT HAPPENED FIRST THING AND WHAT A BETTER WAY TO START OFF THE WEEK. REAL, GATED LINES. ALL OF US NEED THE PROTECTION OF THE LAW TO SECURE OUR FAMILIES. AGAIN, GETTING THAT SECURITY IN NEBRASKA FOR SAME-SEX COUPLES WILL TAKE A WHILE. THE OFFER ISSUED LATE THURSDAY OFFERS NO EXPLANATION, JUST STATING THE DATE OF MAY 12 FOR ORAL ARGUMENTS. -- THE APPEALS COURT WILL COMBINE THE CHALLENGE TO NEBRASKA'S SAME-SEX MARRIAGE BAN BEFORE THE COURT FROM SOUTH DAKOTA, MISSOURI, AND ARKANSAS. STAY WITH KETV NEWSWATCH 7 FOR IN TERMS OF PROTECTING HERSELF FROM SCAM, WE HAVE LINKS TO THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU. AND OUR 8 CAN HELP HOTLINE OPEN FROM 11:00 TO 1:00.
