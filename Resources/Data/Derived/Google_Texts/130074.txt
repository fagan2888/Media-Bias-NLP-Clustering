Ã— Man wanted for 2013 robbery, assault with baseball bat

Elizabethtown Police are looking for a second suspect in the robbery and assault that took place on November 5, 2013 outside the Movi-E-town Cinema. The victim in the attack was lured to the 700 block of North Hanover Street after agreeing to purchase a television from a seller on Craigslist. When the victim arrived at the Movi-E-town Cinema, a woman, later identified as Amber Consylman, led him to the rear west side of the building. As the victim rounded a corner, he was attacked by a man wielding a baseball bat. Consylman was arrested on January 3, 2014 for her role in the assault.

Police now say the man wielding the bat in the attack was Zachary T. Moore, 22, from Rehresburg, formerly of Elizabethtown. Moore is charged with Robbery, Criminal Conspiracy to Commit Robbery, Aggravated Assault, and Theft from a Motor Vehicle.

Moore is still at large. Anyone with information on his whereabouts is asked to contact Elizabethtown Police at 717-367-1835.
