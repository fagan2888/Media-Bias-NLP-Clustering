More than 40% of young adults today are considered underemployed, working in jobs that hardly require a college degree. And college graduates face a crushing amount of student debt ($29,400 on average), while expenses like housing, transportation and health care are only getting more expensive. More than one-third of 18-to-31-year-olds still live at home.\n\nBut the good news is that a few key decisions you make in your 20s \u2014 from what you study and how much you save to what kind of car you drive and where you live \u2014 can drastically improve your chances of coming out on top later in life.\n\nHere are common money mistakes you should avoid at all costs:\n\nChoosing the wrong college \u2014 and major.\n\nCollege is still the best possible investment you could make in your earning potential. But it won\u2019t come cheap: average tuition is $38,000 a year. If you\u2019re about to pump that much capital into your education, make sure your future career will pay enough to make it worth your while.\n\nA recent report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that engineering and math majors can expect to get the highest return on their college investment (21% and 18%, respectively), compared to much lower-earning liberal arts (12%) and education majors (9%).\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean you should abandon your dreams of repairing our nation\u2019s broken public education system or winning a Tony \u2014 we just don\u2019t know that a $50,000-a-year degree is the wisest way to go about it.\n\nWhen choosing your major, consider your talents and interests as well as which types of careers are growing in today\u2019s job market. If you\u2019re undecided, don\u2019t rush into a costly four-year program. Enroll at a community college, which will give you time to consider your options and enjoy much lower tuition at the same time. If you\u2019re determined to attend a pricey private university, research the school\u2019s financial aid packages to figure out how much you can expect to cut the cost of attendance. Of course, staying in-state to take advantage of public tuition breaks is never a bad idea, either.\n\nBeing too shy to negotiate your salary.\n\nIf you don\u2019t negotiate your salary throughout your career, you might as well put $500,000 in a trash can and light it on fire. That\u2019s about how much workers can expect to lose in lifetime earnings if they don\u2019t play hardball at the negotiating table, according to Salary.com.\n\nWhen you\u2019re straight out of college applying for entry-level gigs, there may be fewer opportunities to negotiate. It can never hurt to ask a hiring manager if your salary is negotiable. The worst thing they can do is say no if the position\u2019s salary is predetermined. If you are given the chance to negotiate, make sure you have an idea of what your position typically pays in your city before tossing out an arbitrary number. Check out salary guides on sites like Payscale, Salary.com or Glassdoor.com. Don\u2019t give up if they say your salary isn\u2019t negotiable \u2013 you might be able to work out a deal that gives you more extra vacation days or lets you can telecommute on occasion.

Throw a credit card into the mix and you\u2019ve got the makings of a future financial disaster. People in their 20s have the lowest credit scores of any age group (628) and carry more than $23,000 in debt, according to credit reporting bureau Experian.\n\nRunning up high credit balances, missing payments and frequently opening new lines of credit can destroy your credit score. And a low credit score can limit your access to loans when you need it most, lead to higher interest rates on things like auto and home loans, and even give future employers reason to doubt you as a job candidate.\n\nOf course, you can avoid credit debt by ditching credit cards altogether \u2014 a strategy used by 63% of millennials \u2014 but you may miss out on a chance to build your credit while you\u2019re young.\n\nStudent loan debt, for example, doesn\u2019t impact your credit score as negatively as credit card debt. You can build up your credit without touching a credit card by simply paying your student loan bill each month. Utility bills count, too. If you\u2019re wary of opening your own credit card, consider becoming an authorized user on your parent\u2019s credit card or taking out a secured line of credit from a local bank.\n\nMistaking youth for invincibility.\n\nAccording to a July study by the Commonwealth Fund, nearly 20% of 19-to-34-year-olds were uninsured in 2013. Going without health coverage is financially risky: The uninsured pay for more than one-third of their health care out-of-pocket, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, it\u2019s possible to piggyback off of your parents\u2019 insurance until age 26. If your employer offers health coverage, take the time to research the different plans available and don\u2019t be shy about asking questions. Choosing the cheapest plan can seem financially savvy, but you may get hit with a prohibitively high deductible. If you\u2019re unemployed or can\u2019t get health care through your job, check out plans on the Marketplace. You may qualify for tax subsidies that would reduce your monthly premium.\n\nNot investing in renter\u2019s insurance.\n\nOne of the simplest things you can do to protect your finances in your 20s is to take out a cheap renter\u2019s insurance policy. Your landlord may have an insurance policy for the building, but that won\u2019t include your belongings should anything valuable gets stolen or damaged. Renter\u2019s insurance will replace your belongings in the event of a fire, flood, burglary, or some types of damage. Not all policies are created equal, so choose carefully. A basic policy will cost you between $15 and $30 a month. Start by taking a quick inventory of your belongings and adding up their value \u2014 then compare estimates from several different insurers to see what their policies will cost you.\n\nMoving to a town you can\u2019t afford.\n\nWe get it. What could be a more anticlimactic way to kickstart your career than by hopping in your car after graduation and parking it in your parents\u2019 driveway?\n\nBut hear us out. If financial security is on your list of priorities, taking your entry-level job skills and moving to a top-dollar city straight out of school isn\u2019t the wisest option. Do yourself a solid and take the time to save at least a few months\u2019 worth of living expenses first by living rent-free at Chez Mom and Dad for a few months or even -- gasp -- a year. If the thought of sleeping in your childhood bedroom is too much to bear, consider renting a cheap place with friends while you save.\n\nAnd if you must \u2014 simply must \u2014 follow your heart to whatever money-sucking metropolitan strikes your fancy after graduation, at least come up with a reasonable game plan for how you will afford to survive. Avoid broker\u2019s fees by looking for an apartment on Craigslist. Choose a roommate who can hold up their end of the rent. Ditch your car for public transit. If you find yourself using a credit card to pay for Cup O\u2019 Noodle, recognize that you\u2019re in over your head and ask for help.\n\nTry a cost of living calculator to see what you can expect in different cities.\n\nNot saving for retirement.\n\nAt the rate health care and housing costs are rising, you\u2019re going to need much more cash when you retire than your parents or grandparents ever had to worry about. The good news is that you have one of the greatest assets of all on your side \u2014 time. Thanks to the power of compounding interest, the money you save in your 20s is potentially worth way more than anything you will set aside in your 30s and 40s.\n\nTake our example, Jessica: She\u2019s 22, earning $3,000 a month and decides to save 10% ($300) of her pre-tax salary in a 401(k). If she puts that money into an index fund that we\u2019ll assume earns 6% a year \u2014 even if she never gets a single raise or promotion \u2014 she will have saved $753,849 by age 65. Now, say she waits to start saving until she\u2019s managed to work her way up and feels more financially stable. Even if she doubles her savings to $600 a month, by the time she\u2019s 65, she will have saved only $317,843. (Do your own compound interest calculation here.)\n\nStart small. If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, sign up for it and contribute at least 6% of your paycheck. Increase your contribution by another percentage point every year. If you switch jobs, don\u2019t forget to roll over your 401(k) balance to your new employer. Maybe you'll wind up saving millions and maybe you won\u2019t \u2014 but chances are you\u2019ll be far better off than had you done nothing at all.\n\n--\n\nHave a question about your finances?
