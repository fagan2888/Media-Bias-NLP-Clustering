New on the market: The Nike Volt Vapor driver built for Michelle Wie.

The scoop: The Nike Volt Vapor driver was built for Women’s U.S. Open champion Michelle Wie. The first time she tested the Nike Vapor Speed driver, she immediately asked if it could be made with a Volt crown. Nike did, and she went on to have great success with it.

While it was originally built only for Wie, there was so much interest from the golf public in the club that Nike is making it available at retail stores Friday.

The designers at Nike went to work on a custom paint scheme. The result is the distinctive Nike Vapor Speed High Visibility Volt Edition. While the color design is customized specifically for Wie, the technology and club specs combine three key technologies: Nike’s new FlyBeam-reinforced Covert Cavity Back design, a re-engineered Compression Channel, and FlexLoft 2.

The Covert Cavity Back design spreads weight towards the heel and toe to maximize forgiveness. FlexLoft 2 allows the golf athlete the functionality of five lofts and three face angles within 15 different settings. The new, improved system is five grams (30 percent) lighter without compromising function. The redistribution of mass creates more stability, better launch conditions and faster swing speeds.

What it costs: The Nike Volt Vapor driver hit stores Friday and carries an MSRP of $299.
