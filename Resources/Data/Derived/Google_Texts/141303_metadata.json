In a matter of weeks, the government could run out of cash and begin defaulting on some payments unless Congress acts to raise the official ceiling on the national debt. And once again, Congress is struggling to avoid a potential fiscal and economic train wreck.\n\nBut this fourth debt ceiling standoff in three years is taking place in an atmosphere of fatigue and caution rather than brazenness and conviction. A confrontational parliamentary tactic that came in with a bang might finally be exiting with a whimper.\n\n\u201cThis is the dying gasp of a dead-end strategy,\u201d said Representative Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat. \u201cI think this fight is over.\u201d\n\nEven as some Republicans continued to hunt for one policy concession or another to demand from Democrats in exchange for lifting the ceiling, leadership has indicated it has no appetite for brinkmanship \u2014 particularly as Republicans head into a midterm campaign for control of Congress where they feel they have an upper hand, given the botched rollout of the Affordable Care Act and President Obama\u2019s low approval ratings. And the White House has made clear that it has no intention of giving Republicans anything in exchange for increasing the limit.\n\n\u201cI think that we\u2019re still looking for the pieces to this puzzle,\u201d House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio said at a news conference on Thursday. \u201cBut look, we do not want to default on our debt, and we\u2019re not going to default on our debt. We\u2019re in discussions with members about how we can move ahead.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut there is always a risk, remote as it may be, that something could go wrong. The Obama administration has warned that Congress has less time for its deliberations \u2014 even if they are less heated \u2014 in the latest merry-go-round.\n\nIn the past, the Treasury has managed to keep paying the bills for months after hitting the debt ceiling, using \u201cextraordinary measures\u201d to move cash from pocket to pocket. But it is currently sending out billions of dollars of tax refunds, warning that Congress probably has only until the end of the month to act.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is: Time is short,\u201d said Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew, speaking in Washington this week. \u201cCongress needs to act to extend the borrowing authority for our nation, and it needs to act now.\u201d\n\nAt the moment, a showdown over the debt ceiling seems to be the furthest thing from investors\u2019 minds. Instead, Wall Street is focused on signs of trouble emanating from emerging-market countries like Turkey, Argentina and South Africa and worries over whether growth in both China and the United States is about to falter.\n\n\u201cThe broader markets couldn\u2019t care less,\u201d said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, the head of global fixed-income strategy for Barclays Capital.\n\nIn part, Mr. Rajadhyaksha said, that is because Wall Street has become better at reading the signals coming from Washington after repeated standoffs that were ultimately resolved without a catastrophe. Three years ago, \u201cnobody knew what the exchange stabilization fund was,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody knew what the G-fund was,\u201d he said, referring to accounts that the Treasury tweaks to free up money after it hits the debt ceiling.\n\n\u201cMarkets understand this process considerably better,\u201d he said, \u201cand because of what they\u2019ve learned the past few times, they\u2019re very sanguine at the moment.\u201d\n\nBut even with markets calm, uncertainty stemming from policy impasses in Washington remains a threat \u2014 not just because of the unknown consequences of default for the value of Treasury securities.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFlirting with default comes with costs, even if the government never misses a single payment, experts said. A new study from the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a research group based in Washington, suggested that the cost of last year\u2019s fiscal standoffs lopped roughly a percentage point, or $150 billion, off economic output and cost 750,000 jobs.\n\nAround the world, the perception of Treasury debt as being absolutely safe has shifted, said Adam S. Posen, president of the Peterson Institute and a former central banker at the Bank of England. Managers of sovereign-wealth funds in countries like Norway and Singapore are rethinking their exposure to the dollar, he said.\n\nPhoto\n\n\u201cThe dumb money says, \u2018Every time I reacted to a debt deliberation in the United States, I overreacted and lost money,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut the smart money knows the market has been changed by this uncertainty.\u201d\n\nIn the last few weeks, Republican leaders have trotted out various ideas in hopes of coming up with a plan that would win at least 218 Republican votes in the House, enough to pass a measure without Democratic support. These have included tying the debt ceiling to approval of the Keystone pipeline or to a repeal of a provision in the Affordable Care Act that shelters insurers from higher-than-anticipated claims. But none of those has succeeded.\n\n\u201cYou know, Mother Teresa is a saint now, but if Congress wanted to make her a saint, and attach that to the debt ceiling, we probably couldn\u2019t get 218 votes for it,\u201d Mr. Boehner said Thursday.\n\nA Republican leadership aide said that Mr. Boehner was trying to develop a proposal that would also bring in some Democratic votes. That might include reversing an unpopular cut to military pensions or tweaking Medicare payments to doctors.\n\nPublicly, Democrats are insisting on a \u201cclean\u201d debt ceiling bill, saying they won\u2019t bow to blackmail by Republicans.\n\n\u201cThey are just throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks, and creating more uncertainty,\u201d said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the Democratic chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee. \u201cIt\u2019s time for House Republicans to find their way out of this mess the same way they always do: by agreeing to raise the debt ceiling without any strings attached.\u201d\n\nWhatever the outcome, serious damage has already been done to America\u2019s status in the global economy.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\u201cThe United States has benefited for decades by standing out for the quality of its governance,\u201d Mr. Posen said. \u201cWe\u2019re not Italy. We\u2019re not Greece. Now, we\u2019re just willfully closing that gap.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20140206201810, "twitter": {"description": "There\u2019s less congressional appetite for brinkmanship this time, but the government has only a few weeks\u2019 worth of cash left.", "title": "Skating Close to the Edge, Again, on the Debt Ceiling", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/business/economy/skating-close-to-the-edge-again-on-the-debt-ceiling.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002693638"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "creator": "AnnieLowrey", "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/07/business/CELING/CELING-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/business/economy/skating-close-to-the-edge-again-on-the-debt-ceiling.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002693638", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/business/economy/skating-close-to-the-edge-again-on-the-debt-ceiling.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business/economy", "hdl_p": "Skating Close to the Edge, Again, on the Debt Ceiling", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "Feb. 6, 2014", "edt": "NewYork", "org": "House of Representatives", "keywords": "United States Politics and Government,Federal Budget (US),Treasury Department,National Debt (US),Senate,House of Representatives", "news_keywords": "Senate", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Annie Lowrey", "SCG": "economy", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "byl": "By ANNIE LOWREY", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "There\u2019s less congressional appetite for brinkmanship this time, but the government has only a few weeks\u2019 worth of cash left.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/07/business/CELING/CELING-thumbStandard.jpg", "description": "There\u2019s less congressional appetite for brinkmanship this time, but the government has only a few weeks\u2019 worth of cash left.", "CG": "business", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Feb. 6, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/l/annie_lowrey/index.html", "section": "Business Day", "modified": "2014-02-10", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/index.jsonp", "tag": "House of Representatives", "published": "2014-02-06", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E"}, "thumbnail_height": 75, "slug": "07ceiling", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140210121301, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/07/business/economy/skating-close-to-the-edge-again-on-the-debt-ceiling.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/07/business/CELING/CELING-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "There\u2019s less congressional appetite for brinkmanship this time, but the government has only a few weeks\u2019 worth of cash left.", "title": "Skating Close to the Edge, Again, on the Debt Ceiling"}, "pdate": 20140206, "des": "National Debt (US)", "articleid": 100000002693638, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Skating Close to the Edge, Again, on the Debt Ceiling", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/07/business/CELING/CELING-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0021\"", "article_summary": "But this fourth debt ceiling standoff in three years is taking place in an atmosphere of fatigue and caution rather than brazenness and conviction.\nPublicly, Democrats are insisting on a \u201cclean\u201d debt ceiling bill, saying they won\u2019t bow to blackmail by Republicans.\nThese have included tying the debt ceiling to approval of the Keystone pipeline or to a repeal of a provision in the Affordable Care Act that shelters insurers from higher-than-anticipated claims.\n\u201cNobody knew what the G-fund was,\u201d he said, referring to accounts that the Treasury tweaks to free up money after it hits the debt ceiling.\n\u201cBut look, we do not want to default on our debt, and we\u2019re not going to default on our debt."}
