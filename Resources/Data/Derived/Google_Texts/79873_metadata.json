Ted Cruz has reeled the latest in a long line of endorsements from far right-wing luminaries, this time from 20 state leaders of the conservative, anti-feminist collective, the Eagle Forum.\n\nConservative activist Phyllis Schlafly founded the Eagle Forum in 1972, according to Right Wing Watch,\n\n\u2026as part of her effort to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment. Since then, she has expanded the organization\u2019s focus to include not just fighting \u201cradical feminists\u201d and their \u201cfeminist goals of stereotyping men as a constant danger to women,\u201d but also to opposing gay rights, immigration, U.S. involvement with the United Nations, and national curriculum standards.\n\nEagle Forum founder Schlafly was not among the signatories, and while she \u201chas not explicitly endorsed any candidate,\u201d she has praised Donald Trump as the \u201clast hope for America.\u201d\n\nIn their endorsement, the Eagle Forum signatories tout Cruz\u2019s defense of \u201creligious liberty in public schools, the workplace, and the church,\u201d his opposition to Common Core, legal abortion, Obamacare, and marriage equality; and his ironclad stance against immigration reform, leading \u201cthe charge for amnesty and betrayed the trust of those who elected them.\u201d\n\nThe group certainly shares Cruz\u2019s penchant for punctuating his policy stances with apocalyptic rhetoric. One of Cruz\u2019s endorsers, Cathie Adams, currently the leader of the Texas Eagle Forum and former chairwoman of the Texas Republican Party, has said that immigration reform is a \u201ctool of Satan that will lead to the enactment of Sharia law and usher in the End Times.\u201d\n\nShortly after Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election, Schlafly enjoined the Republican party to continue alienating Hispanics and pursue a policy of reaching out solely to white voters \u2014 advice which ran contrary to the GOP\u2019s post-election \u201cautopsy\u201d report, but appears to have been more or less absorbed by Cruz and party frontrunner Donald Trump.\n\nThe Eagle Forum joins the list of conservative organizations that have thrown their weight behind Cruz, a list that includes founders and spokespeople for the anti-gay, anti-choice groups National Organization for Marriage, American Family Association, Focus on the Family, Family Research Council, as well as a suite of radical pastors.\n\n[h/t Right Wing Watch]\n\n[image via Gage Skidmore]\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Sam Reisman on Twitter: @thericeman", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
