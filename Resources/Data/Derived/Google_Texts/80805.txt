Following his fourth-place finish in the New Hampshire primary Tuesday Jeb Bush is plotting to take out his rivals on the way to being the last establishment man standing against outsider Donald Trump, the GOP’s current leader.

The former Florida governor and one-time establishment favorite on Wednesday set his sights on a surging Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who finished far out of the money in last week’s Iowa caucuses but scored second place in the Granite State, with 16 percent of the vote.

In an internal memo circulated to aides and surrogates, the Bush campaign plotted out a blitz to kneecap Kasich and stifle Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Bush's onetime protege, whose fifth-place New Hampshire finish came after a devastating unforced error in Saturday’s televised Republican debate.
