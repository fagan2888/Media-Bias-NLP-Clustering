He and Kairis talked over each other repeatedly about the remedy being sought by the university in the Affordable Care Act case being heard by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nAlthough there is a provision in the act that allows religious institutions to obtain an exemption to the statute\u2019s contraception mandate, Notre Dame doesn\u2019t want even the \u201ccomplicity\u201d of filing out a form to transfer responsibility for contraceptive services to a third-party provider, Kairis said. Additionally, Notre Dame argues that it shouldn\u2019t be forced to give up a portion of its authority as the administrator of the health care plan to a contractor providing products and services the university considers morally wrong.\n\nPosner repeatedly said that he thought Notre Dame\u2019s objection to the exemption process concerned a \u201ctrivial\u201d role in the provision of health care services. He sought to get Kairis to tell him whether Notre Dame objected simply to sending a letter to the feds stating something along the lines of \u201cwe\u2019re a religious organization, and so we\u2019re just not going to pay.\u201d\n\nIn an increasingly aggravated tone, as Kairis sought to qualify and explain his answers and began speaking more quickly, Posner tried to pin him down and get a yes or a no response.\n\nPosner told Kairis to \u201cstop fencing,\u201d demanded that he answer questions with yes or no responses, and threatened: \u201cLook, if you don\u2019t cooperate with me, I\u2019m not going to let you continue your argument.\u201d\n\nFinally, as the courtroom battle continued, Posner gave the Jones Day partner a lesson in trial advocacy:\n\n\u201cWould you stop babbling?\u201d he told Kairis. \u201cWhen you\u2019re asked a question \u2026 you\u2019re not supposed to interrupt judges and, if they ask questions which can be answered yes or no, you answer yes or no. Don\u2019t you understand that?\u201d\n\nA Religion Clause post provides a link to an audio recording of the 7th Circuit hearing. In addition to Posner, Judge Joel Flaum and Judge David Hamilton sat on the appellate panel.\n\nKairis declined to comment when contacted by the ABA Journal.\n\nColumbus Business First provides a lengthy profile of Kairis, who heads the litigation department in the firm\u2019s Columbus, Ohio, office and played football as an undergraduate at Notre Dame.\n\nSee also:\n\nChicago Tribune: \u201cJudge, Notre Dame attorneys spar in school\u2019s health care law appeal\u201d\n\nWall Street Journal (sub. req.): \u201cJudges Push Back on Notre Dame Challenge\u201d\n\nThird Apple: \u201cHow not to conduct an oral argument\u201d\n\nUpdated Feb. 14 to clarify the lede.", "article_metadata": {"rating": "General", "dcterms.description": "A contentious oral argument Wednesday before a federal appellate court panel in Chicago included a lesson in appellate advocacy for the BigLaw litigation leader representing the University of Notre Dame", "description": "A contentious oral argument Wednesday before a federal appellate court panel in Chicago included a lesson in appellate advocacy for the BigLaw litigation leader representing the University of Notre Dame", "application-name": "ABA Journal", "author": "Martha Neil", "og": {"site_name": "ABA Journal", "description": "A contentious oral argument Wednesday before a federal appellate court panel in Chicago included a lesson in appellate advocacy for the BigLaw litigation leader representing the University of Notre Dame", "title": "Posner tells BigLaw chief, 'stop babbling,' threatens to end argument in contraception mandate case", "url": "http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/Posner_tells_BigLaw_chief_stop_babbling_threatens_to_end_7th_Circuit_arg/", "image": "http://www.abajournal.com/images/topic_images/constitutional.jpg", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.rights": "\u00a9 2004-2016", "twitter": {"description": "A contentious oral argument Wednesday before a federal appellate court panel in Chicago included a lesson in appellate advocacy for the BigLaw litigation leader representing the University of Notre Dame", "title": "Posner tells BigLaw chief, 'stop babbling,' threatens to end argument in contraception mandate case"}, "robots": "All", "dcterms.creator": "ABA Journal", "keywords": "ABA Journal, legal news, law, 7th Circuit Court, States, Appellate Practice, First Amendment, Constitutional Law, Education Law, Trials & Litigation, Health Law, Indiana, Executive Branch", "dcterms.contributor": "Martha Neil", "dcterms.title": "Posner tells BigLaw chief, 'stop babbling,' threatens to end argument in contraception mandate case"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c20\"", "article_summary": "): \u201cJudges Push Back on Notre Dame Challenge\u201dThird Apple: \u201cHow not to conduct an oral argument\u201dUpdated Feb. 14 to clarify the lede.\nIn addition to Posner, Judge Joel Flaum and Judge David Hamilton sat on the appellate panel.\nSee also:Chicago Tribune: \u201cJudge, Notre Dame attorneys spar in school\u2019s health care law appeal\u201dWall Street Journal (sub.\nHome Daily News Posner tells BigLaw chief, 'stop babbling,'\u2026Trials and LitigationPosner tells BigLaw chief, 'stop babbling,' threatens to end argument in contraception mandate caseA contentious oral argument Wednesday before a federal appellate court panel in Chicago included a lesson in appellate advocacy for the BigLaw litigation leader representing the University of Notre Dame in a high-profile health care case.\n\u201cDon\u2019t interrupt,\u201d Judge Richard Posner told Jones Day partner Matthew Kairis several times during the course of a 45-minute argument."}
