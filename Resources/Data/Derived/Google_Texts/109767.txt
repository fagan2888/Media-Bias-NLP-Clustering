Colorado’s health care co-op, which boasts as many as 80,000 members, is being decertified and shut down, after state regulators determined that they could not meet the minimum capital and surplus requirements, the Denver Post reported on Friday. But the story gets weirder from there.

According to the Denver Post:

“After receiving only $2 million of the $16.2 million it expected in ‘risk-corridor’ payments from the federal Centers for Medicaid and Medicare, Colorado HealthOP no longer meets the state’s minimum capital and surplus requirements, state regulators said Friday.”

The health care co-op then began taunting Colorado Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican who was critical of the Obamacare-created entity.

This is unbelievable disingenuous from someone who is part of the Republican-led, engineered dismantling of CO-OPs. https://t.co/HUapBaLm5y — Colorado HealthOP (@COHealthOP) October 16, 2015

But while the co-op was squandering finances and seemingly unable to secure a fraction of its expected “risk-corridor” payments, they were having a blast goofing off at their offices.

The Colorado Health Co-op’s Instagram account paints a picture of quite a relaxed atmosphere amid dwindling finances:

They went bowling:

CO-OPy time at the bowling alley! Now this is what we call getting unplugged. #office #fun A photo posted by Colorado HealthOP (@colorado_healthop) on Aug 6, 2014 at 4:33pm PDT

They dressed up dogs:

Here, they are tossing paper into the air:

Every offices needs a desk treadmill:

They rode scooters around the office, as mandated by their employee handbook:

Such a fun place!
