The path isn\u2019t unusual for young Russians hoping to make the NHL, but only two non-North American players are allowed on each roster in the three leagues under the Canadian Hockey League umbrella.\n\nAs the second overall choice in the CHL\u2019s \u201cimport\u201d draft, Grigorenko settled in under the often sharp-edged tutelage of Quebec Remparts coach Patrick Roy during the 2011-12 season and began an indoctrination to the North American game. One month into that season, his mother came over from Moscow to live with him in an apartment, so that helped. But Roy, the Hall of Fame former goaltender coaching teenagers in his hometown, remained Grigorenko\u2019s hockey mentor.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows who he is, everywhere in the world where they know hockey a little bit,\u201d the soft-spoken Grigorenko, now 21, said recently at Family Sports Center. \u201cI was really excited, especially because he had a little bit of history of Russian players playing for him in juniors.\u201d\n\nRoy\u2019s top Russian star during his eight coaching seasons at Quebec was the enigmatic Alexander Radulov, now playing in the Kontinental Hockey League but who possibly will return to the NHL next season after his contract with CKSA Moscow expires.\n\n\u201cYou always appreciate seeing these guys making this sacrifice,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI just thought Grigo really adapted well to Quebec. There\u2019s one thing you have to appreciate about these (Russians). They know what they want, they believe it\u2019s the best thing for their career, and Grigo came in and a lot of good things happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnderachiever\u201d label\n\nAfter scoring 40 goals in his first Quebec Major Junior Hockey League season, Grigorenko went to the Buffalo Sabres as the 12th overall choice of the 2012 draft. He played 33 more games with Quebec and 25 with Buffalo the next season, and has been trying to dodge the \u201cunderachiever\u201d label since.\n\nGrigorenko last summer came to the Avalanche in the Ryan O\u2019Reilly trade, and that background \u2014 and more \u2014 helps explain why Roy at times can seem exasperated with the play of his young center with Colorado. They go back to Grigorenko\u2019s season and a half in major junior, where a coach \u2014 famous former player or otherwise \u2014 is part father figure, part teacher, part prodding antagonist.\n\n\u201cI think he was trying to be even with everyone,\u201d Grigorenko said of Roy at Quebec. \u201cBut I was there by myself, it was a new language and he was trying to support me. In my draft year, he was really trying to help me learn English, to get better as a player, to learn different aspects of the game that I didn\u2019t know before.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s especially complicated when a center of such promise at times seems disinclined to play with enough fire to take advantage of his unquestioned talent. Grigorenko was spotted as precocious in Moscow, after he and his family moved to the nation\u2019s capital from his birthplace, Khabarovsk, in eastern Russia, when he was 7.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think (Roy) has any special commitment to me or something like this, but he knows what I am capable of,\u201d Grigorenko said. \u201cHe knows that I can be a really good player, so I guess that when he sees I\u2019m not what he would like me to be, I guess he\u2019s a little bit harder on me. But I think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nGrigorenko, who has two goals and 10 assists in 40 games for the Avalanche, was a healthy scratch against New Jersey on Thursday and Columbus on Saturday. If he\u2019s dropped off the top three lines, he\u2019s ill-suited to center the energy fourth line.\n\nAt least so far, that\u2019s not helping validate the Avalanche\u2019s deal for O\u2019Reilly, in which Jamie McGinn also went to the Sabres, and Colorado also received defenseman Nikita Zadorov, 20, who was recalled from San Antonio Wednesday; the rights to University of Michigan captain J.T. Compher; and a second-round draft choice.\n\nThe trade will be back in the spotlight Wednesday, when the Sabres will be in town to face the Avalanche.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t the main piece, probably, in that trade,\u201d Grigorenko said. \u201cThere was Zadorov, a lot of guys, in it. There are a lot of good young players in the Buffalo organization, so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not a coincidence that I ended up here. Probably Patrick knew me and knew how to work with me and we had a pretty good relationship in Quebec, so I think that was a big factor.\u201d\n\nRoy has continued to challenge Grigorenko to play harder.\n\n\u201cIn junior, I was always hard on my players because they wanted to become NHL players,\u201d Roy said. \u201cEven if they aren\u2019t NHL players, they can become great citizens, and you want to help them accomplish that. \u2026 If you want to play at the NHL, you have to be consistent, you have to play hard every night, you have to make those sacrifices.\n\n\u201cI see a lot of talent in Grigo, and I felt that if he could defend well, that would give him the best chance to play ar the NHL level.\u201d\n\nAnd now?\n\n\u201cThe thing we worked hard at in junior was his level of competing,\u201d Roy said. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot better at competing, but the one thing I want to see him improving is his speed.\u201d\n\nConstructive criticism\n\nGrigorenko accepts the criticism as constructive.\n\n\u201cAlways when a coach talks about you, it means he cares, whether it\u2019s a good comment or bad comment,\u201d Grigorenko said. \u201cIf he\u2019s happy about you or not happy about you, he still cares. Especially when he says I should win more battles, shoot more, I should do this; it means he thinks I\u2019m capable of doing those things. I take it well, I take it that the coach believes in me.\u201d\n\nOne striking thing in the Avalanche locker room is that Grigorenko and Zadorov, who also left Russia to play major junior with the London Knights, have made stunning progress in picking up the English language. In Grigorenko\u2019s case, that\u2019s because at Quebec City, Roy \u2014 the French-Canadian coaching in a Francophone city \u2014 insisted on those lessons to prepare his non-English-speaking players for careers in a sport in which the everyday languages in practices and elsewhere are English and profanity.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the journey,\u201d said Roy. \u201cYou have to be able to communicate.\u201d\n\nGrigorenko smiled.\n\n\u201cThe first day at Quebec, I met everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cThe second day, he told me I had to have English classes every day, three hours, five days a week. It wasn\u2019t really a choice. I had a good teacher, I picked it up pretty quick, and the guys helped me too. I watched movies, I watched TV shows, \u2026 and here I am.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @tfrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Mikhail Grigorenko is the center of Patrick Roy\u2019s close attention", "title": "Mikhail Grigorenko is the center of Patrick Roy\u2019s close attention", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/16/mikhail-grigorenko-is-the-center-of-patrick-roys-close-attention/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__BN20160117_CC4_BNSP17HKNGRIGORENKOp2.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160116__BN20160117_CC4_BNSP17HKNGRIGORENKOp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-16T22:34:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:25:55+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cEven if they aren\u2019t NHL players, they can become great citizens, and you want to help them accomplish that.\n\u201cIn junior, I was always hard on my players because they wanted to become NHL players,\u201d Roy said.\nMikhail Grigorenko had just turned 17 when he left his family behind in Russia and journeyed to Quebec City to play major junior hockey.\n\u201cI think he was trying to be even with everyone,\u201d Grigorenko said of Roy at Quebec.\n\u201cEverybody knows who he is, everywhere in the world where they know hockey a little bit,\u201d the soft-spoken Grigorenko, now 21, said recently at Family Sports Center."}
