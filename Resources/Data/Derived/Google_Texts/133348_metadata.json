Additionally, Wheeler said he will circulate among his commissioners a separate proposal allowing stations in rural areas to expand their service areas, which would help them \u201cbe better able to overcome environmental interference.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe commission should eliminate unnecessary rules that impair stations\u2019 ability to serve their listeners, and we should encourage a diversity of voices however we can,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy proposal does both, and I hope my fellow commissioners will support it.\u201d\n\nThe effort builds on an initiative launched by Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, back when she led the FCC as acting chairwoman before Wheeler\u2019s confirmation.\n\nOn Monday, the plan earned early praise from GOP Commissioner Ajit Pai, who has at times sparred with Wheeler over certain contentious items but has also been a staunch supporter of AM radio stations.\n\n\u201cAM revitalization is a cause that has garnered widespread support from large and small broadcasters, civil rights organizations, Democrats, and Republicans,\u201d Pai said in a statement. \u201cI hope that we will move forward on these proposals in the next couple of months.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The FCC wants to make things easier for AM radio stations.", "description": "The FCC wants to make things easier for AM radio stations.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Julian Hattem", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The FCC wants to make things easier for AM radio stations.", "title": "FCC eyes AM radio changes", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/238606-fcc-eyes-am-radio-changes", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-13T12:28:36-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-04-13T12:28-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/238606-fcc-eyes-am-radio-changes", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-13T12:28-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Julian Hattem", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Federal Communications Commission, AM broadcasting, Radio broadcasting,Tom Wheeler,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-13T12:28:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-13T12:28:36-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/238606-fcc-eyes-am-radio-changes", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The FCC wants to make things easier for AM radio stations.", "card": "summary", "title": "FCC eyes AM radio changes"}, "dcterms.title": "FCC eyes AM radio changes"}, "article_summary": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) wants to make things easier for AM radio stations.\nFor instance, he said that the proposed rule change would give AM radio stations more flexibility in dealing with local zoning rules and picking locations.\nOn Monday, the plan earned early praise from GOP Commissioner Ajit Pai, who has at times sparred with Wheeler over certain contentious items but has also been a staunch supporter of AM radio stations.\n\u201cI hope that we will move forward on these proposals in the next couple of months.\u201d\n\u201cAM revitalization is a cause that has garnered widespread support from large and small broadcasters, civil rights organizations, Democrats, and Republicans,\u201d Pai said in a statement."}
