A senior executive of the Yash Birla Group was questioned for over 12 hours by the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) Saturday in connection with cocaine found in his hotel room during an income tax department raid on Friday.

NCB officials identified the executive as Anand Satish Shukla alias Anand Vardhan (31), Group President (Corporate Affairs) of the Birla Group. Sources said Shukla was staying in a room in Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Colaba along with his domestic help and personal security officer, who were also questioned.

We were informed by I-T officials that a suspicious substance had been found in his hotel room while they were conducting a raid. We sent a team to the hotel room and picked up the three people along with the suspicious substance, said NCB zonal director Rohit Katiyar.

Tests using the NCBs drug detection kits revealed that the substance was cocaine. Officials said around five grams of cocaine were found in the room, which was booked in Vardhans name three-four days ago.

Officers said the quantity of cocaine found in the room qualified as intermediate quantity under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act and could attract a maximum of 10 years of imprisonment.
