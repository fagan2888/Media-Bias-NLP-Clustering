About 23 percent of Americans want to keep it as it is, and another 30 percent would like to see the law kept but tweaked. About 33 percent call for repeal of the law.\n\nBut attitudes toward individual parts of the law vary greatly:\n\n74 percent, including 62 percent of Republicans, want to keep the ACA rule that requires insurers to cover people with pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nA more modest 51 percent favor keeping the ACA provision of subsidies to enable people with low incomes to buy insurance.\n\nA similar 53 percent favor keeping the rule requiring employers with more than 50 full-time employees to provide them with insurance.\n\nOnly 41 percent favor keeping the rule increasing the numbers of people eligible for Medicaid.\n\nHowever, 64 percent would like to repeal the ACA's \"individual mandate,\" which requires most people to have insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nThe amount of political opposition on the national level inspired by the Affordable Care Act likely has caused opinions to harden, even though the benefits of the law have proven popular, said Ron Pollack, founding executive director of Families USA, a nonprofit health care consumer advocacy group.\n\n\"The debate about the Affordable Care Act has been sufficiently contentious that often people have strong viewpoints even if they do not yet understand what is in the legislation,\" Pollack said. \"We have seen responses that support virtually all of the major provisions of the ACA, and people think those things are very valuable to them, but they have ambiguity over whether they support the ACA itself.\"\n\nThe continued opposition to the individual mandate reflects the public's general distaste for any mandate or additional tax, Pollack said.\n\n\"A lot of people are not fully aware of why the mandate is really essential in any program that expands [health insurance] coverage to people with pre-existing conditions,\" he said. \"Without the mandate, if there's greater accessibility to coverage, a fair number of people may say, 'I'm not going to pay for coverage until I get sick or have an accident.' Were that to occur, premiums would skyrocket. I'm not sure many people have thought of that.\"\n\nGiven that the poll results reflect more national confidence in Democrats than Republicans regarding health care policy, Pollack said the coming election might see the end of the longstanding Obamacare debate.\n\n\"If the November elections turn out to be such that Hillary Clinton becomes president, I think the contentiousness that has existed for quite a few years is going to diminish, and there won't be any credible sense that the ACA should be or can be repealed,\" he said.\n\nThe HealthDay/Harris Poll was conducted online, in English, within the United States between April 15 and 19 among slightly more than 2,000 adults.\n\nFigures for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, region and household income were weighted where necessary to bring them into line with their actual proportions in the population. \"Propensity score weighting\" was also used, to adjust for respondents' propensity to be online.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on the Affordable Care Act, visit the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nFor more details on the poll, visit The Harris Poll.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/public-health-information-30/misc-insurance-news-424/americans-still-divided-over-affordable-care-act-poll-710504.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/Images/icimages/harris_poll.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "But most support many parts of health care reform law", "title": "6 Years Later, Obamacare Still Divides America: Poll"}, "description": "But most support many parts of health care reform law", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "article_summary": "More informationFor more on the Affordable Care Act, visit the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\nSupport for the Affordable Care Act remains about the same as it has been since President Barack Obama signed it into law in 2010.\nHowever, none of the current crop of presidential candidates appears to inspire much hope that they'll properly handle health care policy if elected, the poll results show.\nGiven that the poll results reflect more national confidence in Democrats than Republicans regarding health care policy, Pollack said the coming election might see the end of the longstanding Obamacare debate.\n\"The debate about the Affordable Care Act has been sufficiently contentious that often people have strong viewpoints even if they do not yet understand what is in the legislation,\" Pollack said."}
