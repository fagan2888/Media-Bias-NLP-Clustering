I think that\u2019s the biggest question today. Bigger than who\u2019s going to control the Assembly come January, since nobody seems to think Democrats are in any real danger of losing control.\n\nThe number to beat (or, rather, not beat) is 24.5 percent. That was the turnout for the October 16 2014 special election \u2014 held on a Wednesday \u2014 that made Cory Booker our senator.\n\nHere\u2019s a rundown of the districts to watch today by me and Brendan Cheney: http://politi.co/1k6QqtY\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: \u201c(Matt) Kopko visited the HQ again a short time later with a Jersey Journal photographer. Kopko stood outside the building for a few seconds, and then someone inside the office walked to the front door and locked it from the inside. Afterward, (Angela) McKnight's campaign released a statement saying Kopko had been \u2018yelling and cursing\u2019 and that her staff \u2018had to force him out and lock the door to prevent him from re-entering.\u2019 The photographer said Kopko didn't yell, curse or try to enter the building on that visit.\u201d \u2014 The Jersey Journal\u2019s Terrence McDonald http://bit.ly/1NNFF9t\n\nWHERE\u2019S CHRISTIE?\n\nPREZ POLLS\n\nNATIONAL \u2014 NBC/WSJ poll puts Christie at 3 percent, in a four-way tie for sixth place. This is actually good news for Christie, per Patrick Murray, as this puts him at 2.5 percent average in the last four polls, which is the minimum he needs to be in the next prime time debate. We\u2019ll see if any more polls come out before the Nov. 4 cut-off. The debate occurred as this poll was still in the field. http://on.wsj.com/1NNG4sz\n\nNEW HAMPSHIRE \u2014 Monmouth post-debate poll shows Christie at 5 percent, tied for 7th place with Carly Fiorina. Favorability has improved to 54 percent from 32 percent two months ago.\n\nIowa \u2014 Public Policy Polling shows Christie in 9th place at 3 percent. But, like in New Hampshire, his favorability has turned around. He\u2019s now at 48 percent positive to 28 percent negative \u2014 up from 34 percent positive and 44 percent negative in August. PPP called that an \u201camazing transformation.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NNH3Jf\n\nChristie says he\u2019ll \u201cpeak at exactly the right time,\u201d in December and January. Let\u2019s see. http://bit.ly/20pfr3O\n\nTips? suggestions? criticism? observations? birthday shoutouts? Email me at mfriedman@politico.com.

He also joined U.S. Senator Cory Booker, a national advocate for criminal justice reform, and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka for a roundtable discussion with former prisoners and criminal-justice officials at Rutgers University-Newark \u2026 \u2018The federal government is a big employer,\u2019 Obama said during his appearance at Rutgers-Newark. \u2018And, like a lot of big employers, on many job applications there is a box that asks if you have a criminal record. If you answer yes, the odds are you\u2019re not getting a call back. We\u2019re going to do our part in changing this.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1NNHwLk\n\n\u2014\u201cEx-cons: Obama's speech at Rutgers 'strikes a chord deep down'\u201d http://bit.ly/1NNHVNW\n\nI THINK I HEAR THE OBAMACARE WAAMBULANCE \u2014\u201cNewark council fuming after being left out of Obama visit,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Dan Ivers: \u201cIn a statement, Central Ward Councilwoman Gayle Chaneyfield Jenkins placed the blame with Baraka\u2019s office, saying she had been assured that members of the body would be included in the event, but that no invitation or further details followed. \u201cI am stunned and deeply offended that my colleagues and I were not formerly asked nor invited to participate in one of the most important discussions facing America since Reconstruction taking place in our own city,\u201d she said. http://bit.ly/1NNI2c8\n\nFOLLOWING NEW YORK TIMES\u2019 LEAD, OBAMA TRIES TO GIVE CHRISTIE A BOOST \u2014 \u201cWhite House rips Christie for saying Obama doesn't back police,\u201d by The Hill\u2019s Jordan Fabian: \u201cPress secretary Josh Earnest called Christie\u2019s claim that Obama does not support police \u2018particularly irresponsible,\u2019 suggesting it's an attempt to \u2018turn around\u2019 his struggling presidential campaign. \u2018They\u2019re not surprising for somebody whose poll numbers are closer to an asterisk than they are double digits,\u2019 Earnest said.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NNkdS1\n\n\u2014\u201cChristie lashes out at White House spokesman, calls him 'hack'\u201d http://bit.ly/1k6TUwz\n\nTHIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH 2016 \u2014 \u201cChristie tries to upstage Obama, from sunrise to sunset,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Ryan Hutchins and Katie Jennings: \u201cGov. Chris Christie has been dogged for months by inaccurate claims he gave President Obama a hug after Hurricane Sandy, just days before the last presidential election. He\u2019s been slammed by pundits and told by political analysts the false-memory has tarnished his reputation with conservative voters. So it would have been logical for the Republican, now running a White House bid of his own, to steer clear of Obama\u2019s visit to Newark on Monday. But Christie didn\u2019t use the cover of a busy schedule in New Hampshire or Iowa to quietly excuse himself. Instead, he scheduled his own event in New Jersey \u2014 an official event as governor, not candidate \u2014 to talk about the same subject as the president: Criminal justice reform.\u201d http://politi.co/1NNIIOW\n\n\u2014\u2014\u201cChristie raps Obama on criminal justice issues\u201d http://politi.co/1WsAFyp\n\n\u2014Republican candidates from Camden County protested Christie and his relationship with George Norcross http://bit.ly/1NNKlMo\n\n** A Message from Nuclear Matters: Providing more than 62% of America\u2019s carbon-free electricity, existing, state-of-the-art nuclear energy plants play a vital role in achieving our clean-energy and carbon-reduction goals.

POPULAR \u2014 \u201cRepublican leader defends Christie\u2019s absence from Assembly campaign trail,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Matt Friedman: \u201cThree weeks ago, Assembly Republican leader Jon Bramnick said he wanted to have Gov. Chris Christie headline public events for Republicans\u2019 efforts to take control of the Assembly. It hasn\u2019t happened \u2026 Asked why it never happened, Bramnick bristled. \u2018He\u2019s invited anywhere and we love him. He\u2019s got his schedule,\u2019 Bramnick said. \u2018That\u2019s not going to be my focus. Everyone\u2019s focus should be the fact that the [New Jersey Education Association] is now a new political party in the state, spending more money than the Democrats and Republicans together.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1NNJBqI\n\nBECAUSE HE ALWAYS WORKED SO HARD FOR LEGISLATIVE CANDIDATES \u2014 \u201cChristie: Unfair legislative redistricting map to blame for uncompetitive election,\u201d by The Burlington County Times\u2019 David Levinsky: \u201cGov. Chris Christie said the lack of competitive races has nothing to do with the incumbents or challengers and everything to do with the legislative boundaries drawn up more than four years ago by the state's redistricting commission. \u2018I understand the politics in this state as well or better than anybody. This is an unfair map. The fact you're seeing not a lot of competitive races is because the map is unfair,\u2019 Christie said Monday.\u201d http://bit.ly/1H2lOnn\n\n\u2014Here\u2019s an analysis I wrote in 2013 of the election results, which shows nuance that\u2019s not in Christie\u2019s arguments. That year turnout was higher in GOP areas than Democratic districts. And in competitive districts, many voters simply split their tickets between Christie and Democratic legislative candidates. http://bit.ly/1H2m4CD\n\n\u2014\u201cSuper PAC \u2018still running\u2019 anti-Angelini ad, despite lawsuit threat\u201d http://politi.co/1NNJOtV\n\n\u2014\u201cBramnick not giving up on DiPisa, but ignores Cappola\u201d http://politi.co/1NNJRWB\n\nWOULD IT BE A HUDSON COUNTY ELECTION WITHOUT CALLING SOMEONE A KLANSMAN? \u2014 \u201cFlier calling GOP Assembly candidate a 'klansman' adds drama to Hudson Co. race,\u201d by The Jersey Journal\u2019s Terrence T. McDonald: \u201cNo one is taking credit for the campaign literature, which features a black-and-white photograph of Assembly hopeful Matt Kopko altered to look like he is in KKK garb and alleges he \u2018wants to close down the Urban League\u2019 and \u2018move minorities from their homes.\u2019 \u2026 Chiaravalloti said he didn't know about the flier. Asheenia Johnson, spokeswoman for McKnight's campaign, said her campaign had no hand in creating it or distributing it, adding that she wouldn't be surprised if Kopko made it himself to tarnish McKnight's campaign \u2026 The flier led to a confrontation this morning between McKnight and Kopko at the Ocean Avenue headquarters of Angela Cares, the senior services nonprofit McKnight runs. McKnight's campaign said Kopko \"stormed\" the office and threatened her, an allegation Kopko called \"ridiculous.\" He said he asked McKnight about the flier and left when he was asked to leave.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NNi4FJ\n\nIN OTHER WORDS, HE\u2019LL WAIT UNTIL WE FORGET TO ASK \u2014 \u201cChristie: Decision not to renominate Bergen County Prosecutor Molinelli \u2018long overdue\u2019,\u201d by The Record\u2019s Dustin Racioppi: \u201cGovernor Christie said Monday that his decision not to renominate John Molinelli as Bergen County prosecutor was a move that was \u2018long overdue,\u2019 but would not elaborate on the reasons why in his first comments on the matter. \u2018The fact is that it\u2019s time for a change in Bergen County. It\u2019s long overdue,\u201d Christie said following a meeting in Camden where he was highlighting police reform. \u201cWhen that change is officially made, I\u2019ll give you all the reasons why.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1NNkZhU\n\nASSUMING CHRISTIE MAKES IT ON TO THE MAIN STAGE NEXT TIME \u2014 \u201cGOP rivals not on same page about debate controversy,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Nick Gass: \u201cWhile many of the GOP campaigns came together in a show of force Sunday night to protest the debate process, Monday brought some discord, with Chris Christie and Carly Fiorina publicly saying it's time to move on.\u201d Christie: \u201cyou know, stop complaining. You know, do me favor. Set up a stage, put podiums up there, and let\u2019s just go.\u201d http://politi.co/1NNjsZd\n\nDEMS NEED 7 REPUBLICAN VOTES \u2014 \u201cN.J. Assembly sets vote on override of Christie gun bill veto,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Samantha Marcus: \u201cThe state Assembly is expected to hold a vote to override Gov. Chris Christie's veto of a gun control bill on Dec. 3, Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto announced Monday.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NNlatv\n\n\u2014Montclair State political science professor Brigid Harrison keeps tabs on all those Democrats who endrosed Christie in 2013 http://bit.ly/1NNlwAr\n\nA SILVER LINING FOR THE SILVER METEOR? \u2014 \u201cHudson rail tunnel could benefit Amtrak,\u201d by The AP: \u201cA cancelled Hudson River rail tunnel project that cost New Jersey millions of dollars could wind up paying some dividends \u2026 Amtrak is considering using the same route through northern New Jersey as part of a plan to build a new tunnel \u2026 Using the route could save time and money since environmental studies were completed for the previous project.\u201d http://on.app.com/1NNIM11\n\nBIOFUELS \u2014 \u201cPayne, Congressional Black Caucus members urge no biofuels cuts,\u201d by POLITICO's David Giambusso: \u201cRep. Donald Payne led 15 other members of the Congressional Black Caucus in urging late last week Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy not to reduce the biofuels requirement in the national renewable fuel standard. The renewable fuel standard, long opposed by the oil industry, requires a certain amount of biofuels, such as corn-based ethanol, to be mixed with gasoline. The EPA is conducting an examination of the ethanol and biofuel requirements, which many see as a first step towards reducing them.\u201d http://politi.co/1GIwbN3\n\nAT LEAST WE\u2019RE NOT #1 \u2014 \u201cThe Worst States For Taxes,\u201d from Forbes: http://onforb.es/1H2mUzu\n\nWHELAN\u2019S FANTASY \u2014 \u201cN.J. lawmaker wants to regulate fantasy sports,\u201d by NJ Advance Media\u2019s Brent Johnson: \u201cLess than a week after Gov. Chris Christie belittled the idea during the third Republican presidential debate, a state lawmaker is seeking to regulate fantasy sports in New Jersey. State Sen. Jim Whelan (D-Atlantic) said Monday he will soon introduce a bill that would require daily fantasy sports companies like DraftKings and FanDuel \u2014 as well as casinos that offer fantasy sports \u2014 to be regulated and vetted in New Jersey the same as online gambling companies.\u201d http://bit.ly/1NNloRr\n\nFORGET THAT BOOK HE WROTE \u2014 \u201cCappola: Black Lives Do Matter,\u201d by PolitickerNJ\u2019s Alyana Alfaro: \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t think the movement is misguided,\u2019 Cappola told PolitickerNJ. \u2018Let\u2019s be honest. Who is sitting in these jails? It is young, black men. I support the ethos and the will to have to do something about this because it is insanity what is going on. Who is suffering the most here? It is young, black men and their lives do matter.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1NNk40P\n\nWHAT ABOUT WHEN CHRISTIE SAID COMMON CORE WAS NOT WORKING? \u2014 \u201cEducation commissioner recommends PARCC scoring standards,\u201d by POLITICO\u2019s Linh Tat: \u201cState education commissioner David Hespe this week is expected to recommend scoring benchmarks for the PARCC standardized test that are consistent with the guidelines set by the creators of the exam. Specifically, students must place in levels 4 or 5 \u2014 that is, post a score of at least 750 \u2014 to be considered meeting grade-level standards, according to a resolution the state Board of Education will be asked to approve Wednesday.\u201d http://politi.co/1NNHOSs\n\nNOT SURE IT WAS REALLY A PROMISE \u2014 \u201cFEMA blows by \u201890 day\u2019 promise to shorted Sandy victims,\u201d by The Asbury Park Press\u2019 Russ Zimmer: For homeowners like Anthony and Sharon Colucci, FEMA's failure to meet its own self-imposed deadline for reviewing potentially underpaid superstorm Sandy flood insurance claims is just another broken promise. The Coluccis, who own a home in the flood-torn Ortley Beach section of Toms River, are one of more than 17,000 homeowners who believed they had been cheated out of the full extent of their flood coverage and asked the feds to take a second look \u2026 After a 30-day extension to try and boost low enrollment, the Sandy Claims Review program closed to new applicants on October 15. Despite opening more than 160 days ago, less than 200 people have been paid out, according to figures provided by FEM \u2026 .\u2019We believe we can conclude most reviews within 90 days of the policyholder requesting the review,\u2019 Brad Kieserman, who developed the review process for FEMA, told Congress in June.\u201d http://on.app.com/1NNmHji\n\nAFTER THE OMNIA PR DISASTER \u2014 \u201cInsure.com ranks Horizon BCBSNJ as best U.S. health insurance company,\u201d by NJ Biz\u2019s Anjalee Khemlani: \u201cHorizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey was ranked as the top health insurance company based on customer satisfaction in the country.

Five Points. The Red Hook docks. The Meadowlands. Harlem. The South Shore of Staten Island.While the North Jersey borough [of Ft. Lee} might seem an unlikely capital on the gangland map, in the mid-20th century it was home to some of the most notorious mobsters around: Joe Adonis, Willie Moretti, Longie Zwillman and most famous and feared of all, the head of Murder Incorporated, Albert Anastasia. For those wanting to live like a Mafia don \u2014 and willing to live with a few ghosts \u2014 Guernsey\u2019s will auction off the old Anastasia estate on Dec. 8, with a minimum price of $5.5 million.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1SkvXNn\n\nTRENTON \u2014 \u201cCollusion alleged for $2.4M-IT contract offered by Trenton Mayor Jackson administration,\u201d by The Trentonian\u2019s David Foster: \u201cThe music starts up like a beat from the 1990s.
