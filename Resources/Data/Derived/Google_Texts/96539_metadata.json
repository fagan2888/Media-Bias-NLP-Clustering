Tom Harkin put it shortly before his retirement, Democrats \u201cshould have pursued single-payer right from the get-go.\u201d\n\nThese advocates perhaps haven\u2019t noticed that their latest efforts to give the government greater control over our health care just collapsed \u2014 in the People\u2019s Republic of Vermont of all places.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act gave states the ability to opt out of ObamaCare, if they wanted to set up a single-payer system instead. So far, Vermont has been the only state to try to take advantage of that option.\n\nIn 2011, Vermont passed legislation that would have set up a single-payer system in the state starting in 2017, the first year permitted under the ACA.\n\nThe state government, advised by none other than Jonathan \u201cStupidity of the American voter\u201d Gruber, designed a program, known as Green Mountain Care, that would have provided nearly all state residents with taxpayer-funded comprehensive health care, including dental and vision care.\n\nBenefits would have been substantially more generous than those provided through ObamaCare. Consider that the least expensive ObamaCare plan, the Bronze Plan, has an \u201cactuarial value\u201d of 60%. That is, insurance pays 60% of health costs, and the patient pays 40% through co-payments, deductibles and so forth. The most expensive Platinum ObamaCare plans have an actuarial value of 90%.\n\nGreen Mountain Care would have had an actuarial value of 94%!\n\nWith the exception of multi-state employers, governed by federal law, private health insurance would be essentially abolished. Rather than premiums, Green Mountain Care would be paid for through taxes.\n\nAnd there was the rub.\n\nAs humorist P.J. O\u2019Rourke once said, \u201cIf you think health care is expensive now, just wait until it\u2019s free.\u201d\n\nVermonters were stunned to discover just how much their new \u201cfree\u201d health care was going to cost. Paying for Green Mountain Care would have required a 160% increase in state taxes by 2019, as much as $2.9 billion annually. The state\u2019s top income tax rate would have been raised from 8.95% to an astounding 18%. For high earners that would mean a combined federal-state income tax burden of 56%. Even lower-income Vermonters would have seen a substantial tax hike.\n\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, businesses would have been hit with an 11.5% state payroll tax. That would be on top of a federal payroll tax of 15.3% to 16.2%, as well as federal and state corporate income taxes. That\u2019s not exactly going to lead to an employment boom.\n\nTrue, Vermonters would save the money that they currently pay for premiums and most out-of-pocket health-care costs, but even after accounting for such savings, most state residents would be worse off.\n\nBecause even these enormous tax hikes wouldn\u2019t have provided enough money, Green Mountain Care would have cut payments to doctors and hospitals by an estimated 16%. That would have forced many doctors out of the state and threatened the viability of local hospitals.\n\nWith the supply of providers drying up, patients would have inevitably faced delays in treatment and waiting lists. And even then, according to numbers released by the governor\u2019s office, the plan would be running in the red within four years.\n\nVermont\u2019s single-payer system would have delivered worse health care at a higher taxpayer cost.\n\nIt should have been no surprise then when late last month Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin, a Democrat, announced that the state was giving up and abandoning its plans for Green Mountain Care.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t dampened liberal enthusiasm. Legislation similar to Vermont\u2019s is pending in several states, including Illinois, Massachusetts, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania and Washington.\n\nIn New York, Assemblyman Richard Gottfried (D-Manhattan), chairman of the Assembly Committee on Health, has been holding a series of high-profile town halls across the state to promote his single-payer bill.\n\nGottfried\u2019s idea is backed by major labor unions and several influential New York politicians, including State Sen. Bill Perkins (D-Harlem), Assemblyman Phil Steck (D-Albany), and, of course, Mayor de Blasio.\n\nOne of the advantages of our federalist form of government is that states can act as, in the words of Justice Louis Brandies, \u201cthe laboratories of democracy.\u201d\n\nVermont\u2019s laboratory experiment has failed.
