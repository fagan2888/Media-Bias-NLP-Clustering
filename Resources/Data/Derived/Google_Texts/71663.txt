CNN’s Jake Tapper and Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson discussed the ongoing controversy surrounding Planned Parenthood’s apparent complicity in the harvest and sale of aborted body parts during a recent segment of The Lead.

A series of undercover videos revealed the disturbing practice, prompting Planned Parenthood Executive Vice President Dawn Laguens to respond. In a statement this week, she declared that those who released the footage engaged in a “grossly offensive act” against an organization that exists to “foster an environment in our country where providers of essential women’s health care and their patients are not subject to threats, harassment and intimidation.”

Tapper asked Carson for his reaction to Laguens’s reaction.

“The argument is,” the host began, “that none of the federal money pays for abortion. That is separate funding; and by defunding Planned Parenthood you would be eliminating all these other vital medical procedures, which you as a doctor know.”

Carson replied: “All of the services she mentioned are available through multiple other sources.”

He continued, alleging that the taxpayer-supported organization “makes money selling baby parts” and “doesn’t seem to understand the sanctity of human life and is willing to destroy that.”

Tapper used Carson’s point regarding disproportionately high numbers of Planned Parenthood facilities in minority communities to suggest that poor Americans might need the health services these clinics provide.

“I thought they were supposed to be able to get all of these things based on Obamacare,” Carson retorted. “Why do we need Planned Parenthood?”
