Five months ago, the Doral resident started vaping.\n\n\u201cNow that I switched to this, I just can\u2019t stop smoking it, he said while shopping at the Vapor Shark smoke shop in South Florida, where he buys his \u2018go to\u2019 e-juice \u2013 a tobacco-free liquid that serves as a replacement for nicotine. His favorite flavor: custard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really helped with the cigarettes,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t even smoke any more cigarettes.\u201d\n\nUranga is part of a surge in Floridians opting for flavored, tobacco-free liquid that\u2019s inserted into something resembling a ball point pen. Batteries and a few clicks of a button, and heat coils turn the liquid into smoke.\n\nLittle more than a decade since they started being sold in the United States, \u2018vaping\u2019 has become a popular alternative to tobacco cigarettes \u2013 a known carcinogen.\n\nBut it\u2019s also rising in popularity more quickly than existing health policy or the science on the long-term health effects of vaping. Right now, the Food and Drug Administration is reviewing whether or not to regulate e-cigarettes. And researchers from Miami and Tampa are launching new studies to better understand how e-cigarettes affect the body.\n\nSadallah Kahuk and his cousin own Euphoric Smoke shop in Hollywood, in a neighborhood with at least a dozen smoke shops. While their store specializes in hookah sales, a tribute to their roots in the Palestinian territories, sales shot through the roof once they introduced the flavored e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s popular because there are millions of flavors,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can go from a cereal to a desert to caramel to bacon.\u201d\n\nKahuk said smokers like that the ingredients for vaping feel less harsh than what is in traditional cigarettes, and that they can choose the level of nicotine in their solution and how much smoke the e-cigarette produces. He said he thinks it\u2019s healthier than tobacco cigarettes.\n\n\u201cI mean it is better than cigarettes, just because of the different chemicals that go into cigarettes opposed to what\u2019s in a vapor,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have glycerin, vegetable oil, flavoring and the nicotine.\u201d\n\nBut that feeling that electronic cigarettes are safer than tobacco isn\u2019t a sure thing, said Dr. Mathias Salathe, a pharmacology professor at the University of Miami.\n\n\u201cIt is completed unregulated at the present time, so (while) inhaling these vapors are considered safe by the general public ...in fact, our preliminary data suggests they are not.\u201d\n\nThe Florida Department of Health awarded Salathe\u2019s research team a $2 million grant to follow e-cigarette users for 5 years. His earlier research, on animals, found that vaping causes many of the same problems as traditional cigarettes, like inflammation, which can lead to cancer.\n\nSalate\u2019s new electronic cigarette study will be one of the first to use human subjects. Over the next five years, the UM researchers will interview patients from local smoking cessation clinics, conduct routine checkups and monitor their health.\n\n\u201cThe research here is really to find out whether there is a safety issue with e-cigarettes,\u201d he said. \u201cOr should we just leave it alone because it is safe?\u201d\n\nAt the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Dr. Thomas Brandon is trying to see if electronic cigarettes really are effective at helping people quit tobacco. He said unlike traditional nicotine replacements like gum or patches, smokers find e-cigarettes comforting.\n\n\u201cThey have the theoretical advantage of being more similar to cigarettes in how you use them. You know, the fact that they look like cigarettes, you bring them to your mouth like a cigarette, they produce something that looks like smoke. Smokers often find [it] calming just watching the smoke rise,\u201d said Brandon, whose work is being conducted as part of Moffitt\u2019s Tobacco Research & Intervention Program.\n\nSalathe, the UM Professor, said these studies could provide the U.S. Food and Drug Administration with data needed to better understand e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cThey cannot regulate something without the science, so the science is interesting for public health policy,\u201d Salathe said.\n\nThe research also is coming at a time when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is reporting that the number of middle and high school students trying electronic cigarettes has tripled in the past two years.\n\nSalathe said teens have always been drawn to cigarettes, but the perception that vaping is healthier makes it even more tempting\n\n\u201cCigarettes [are] bad in the ad campaigns\u2026Well, e-cigarettes are (advertised as) not being bad for you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so you remove the danger and the cool factor comes in.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that it\u2019s less expensive than tobacco cigarettes. Uranga, the ex- tobacco smoker from Doral, said vaping has saved him money.\n\n\u201cI was wasting about $50, $60 a month, now, here, I\u2019m wasting maybe $20, $30,\u201d he said of basic kits that cost about $20. The liquid vials cost as little as $5 each.\n\nThere\u2019s the social factor, too.\n\nBack in Hollywood, one block away from Kahuk\u2019s Euphoric Smoke shop, Kosta Kokavessis and his friends are trying new e-cigarette flavors at a shop called Carbon Glass. Kokavessis, 20, never smoked tobacco, until he was hired at Carbon Glass.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just fun, like smoking and doing smoke tricks and stuff,\u201d he said.\n\nKokavessis and his friends said they can\u2019t worry if vaping is dangerous to their health. Unlike decades of research \u2013 and millions of deaths - that proved cigarettes lead to cancer, the information about e-cigarettes just doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nUntil there is, they say, they\u2019ll keep their fingers crossed that it\u2019s going to be ok.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun though,\u201d he said.\n\nMiami Herald intern Jennifer Luna contributed to this report.
