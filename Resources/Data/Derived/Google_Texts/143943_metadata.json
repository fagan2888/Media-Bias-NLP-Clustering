The plant, Exide Technologies, already has been accused of endangering the lives of 110,000 people who live nearby.\n\nBut neighborhood residents and community leaders say they\u2019re skeptical that the test results will force Exide\u2019s factory to close before it can do any more harm.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that they\u2019re testing, and I\u2019d say that it\u2019s long overdue,\u201d said Monsignor John Moretta of Resurrection Catholic Church in Boyle Heights, a neighborhood about a mile from the plant. He says that members of his congregation have long been worried about emissions from the plant.\n\n\u201cBut this is all pretty superficial. It doesn\u2019t get to the real question, which is, at what point do you wait for them to go into more violations before you shut them down?\u201d\n\nCalifornia regulation ensures the safe treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste, and requires that factories such as battery recyclers satisfy rigorous environmental reviews before obtaining a permit. But Exide has never met that standard.\n\nLong history of citations\n\nThe plant has a long history of air pollution write-ups, including allegations that it allowed lead dust to contaminate the surrounding neighborhood, regulators say. Still, state officials allowed the factory, which melts tens of thousands of batteries a day, to operate on \u201cinterim status\u201d for some 30 years.\n\nIn April, the state Department of Toxic Substances Control took action and ordered Exide to suspend operations. Regulators said arsenic emissions from the plant endangered as many as 110,000 who live in Boyle Heights and other nearby neighborhoods. The South Coast Air Quality Management District estimated cancer risk from the airborne arsenic at up to 15 times state standards.\n\nThe Department of Toxic Substances Control also found that contaminants had seeped into the ground from corroded pipes at up to 63 times the levels allowed under state law.\n\nBut Exide appealed the suspension. In court filings, Exide said it has reduced its arsenic emissions by 70 percent since 2010. Company attorneys argued that regulators were bowing to public outrage and acting arbitrarily. In mid-June, Los Angeles County Judge Luis Lavin ordered the plant reopened.\n\nLavin said that keeping the factory closed wouldn\u2019t improve neighborhood health conditions immediately and would cause irreparable harm to the company. He affirmed that ruling two weeks later, pending an administrative law hearing.\n\nThat hearing was to resume Tuesday, but DTSC requested a postponement because Exide agreed to address the leaking pipes and airborne emissions identified in the agency\u2019s suspension order.\n\n\u201cWe are obligated to articulate, and have discussed with (Exide) \u2026 what actions would have to occur at the facility in order to correct the unacceptable conditions,\u201d agency spokesman Russ Edmondson wrote in an email Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf and when Exide demonstrates that it can satisfy these requirements, DTSC will have achieved its goal in ensuring that the facility operates safely and would consider lifting the suspension.\u201d\n\nHe said the faulty pipes are now out of service and Exide has installed a temporary drainage system. A permanent drainage system is in the planning stage.\n\nNeighborhood resident Cristal Rivera said she has lost confidence that state regulators will protect her, her husband or their 8-month-old son, Julian.\n\n\u201cThe things they want Exide to do are good, but they don\u2019t seem to have much power,\u201d she said.\n\nFactory operated despite damaged system to filter toxic emissions\n\nOn July 7, just five days after Judge Lavin\u2019s ruling to reopen the plant, Exide reported that heat had damaged air filtration devices in one of two \u201cbaghouses\u201d that are supposed to scrub out toxic emissions. Even though its air filtration system was compromised, the factory continued to operate, South Coast Air Quality Management District spokesman Sam Atwood said.\n\nHe said Exide temporarily shut down portions of the factory that vented to the baghouses but resumed operations the next day, triggering a citation from the Air Quality Management District on July 9. After that, the company closed down operations until the filtration system was repaired, a district report shows.\n\nThe district had ordered additional remediation measures and set a deadline of Sept. 1 for Exide to report what new steps it was taking to safeguard the public from its toxic emissions.\n\nBut in an interview last week, Atwood said no such report had been received.\n\n\u201cI think their response is going to be, \u2018Our plan is what we\u2019ve already done,\u2019 \u201d Atwood said.\n\nThe company has installed an automatic door between a storage bin for dismantled batteries and blast furnaces where it melts them, he said. Formerly, the furnaces could freely vent gases into the air through the entrance to the storage bin. Now the automatic gate keeps that passageway closed part of the time.\n\n\u201cThen the question becomes, \u2018Where\u2019s the proof that this has accomplished the risk reduction?\u2019 \u201d Atwood said.\n\nExide spokeswoman Susan Jaramillo did not respond to repeated requests for comment.\n\nRivera, the young mother, said she can\u2019t afford to wait. She said she and her husband have decided to sell their house and move to a safer area.\n\n\u201cThere will be gases that stay in that room with the furnace,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they open that gate, they\u2019re going to come out.\u201d\n\nIn the neighboring community of Bell, City Councilman Nestor Enrique Valencia, a founder of the health activist group Our Salud, said he\u2019s skeptical of government efforts. He admits that\u2019s partly due to his experience of government in his own city, which was shaken by a political corruption scandal in 2010 and 2011. (Valencia was not implicated in the scandal and won his council seat in 2011.)\n\n\u201cAfter all that, I\u2019m not going to sit there and listen to a bunch of bureaucrats. I\u2019m just very leery, if not skeptical, of (state agencies\u2019) work,\u201d he said. \u201cI know they\u2019re trying, but I don\u2019t see them being very successful in closing this plant down.\u201d\n\nValencia said a private lab has tested the blood-lead levels of some 15 people living in the area, and additional testing is scheduled. He has asked local school officials for permission to meet with parents on campus and urge them to have their children tested.\n\nDavid Campbell, a spokesman for unionized plant workers, said federally mandated blood tests among employees did not find elevated lead levels. He said he supports additional soil testing and blood testing for the wider community.\n\nEdmondson said dust testing is beginning within 500 feet of the Exide plant, progressing in 1,500-foot concentric circles. Samples are drawn from stormwater curb boxes and open drainage channels, the Los Angeles River channel, sidewalks, and the roofs and grounds of neighboring facilities.\n\nTest results will be available in early December, Edmondson said. If they show contamination, the department will conduct additional testing in a broader area, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Resurrection Catholic School, which is affiliated with Moretta\u2019s parish, principal Angelica Figueroa said faculty members have been encouraging children to participate in public meetings and other political processes that can influence regulators to increase their oversight of companies like Exide.\n\nThe school is about a mile and a half from Exide.\n\n\u201cThese companies would not go to the Westside or Pasadena or any other more affluent area,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy? Because people there will step up and voice their concerns. Well, I want our students to know that they have that same right.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "State-ordered testing of the soil for lead and other toxins around a battery recycling plant in Vernon is underway.
