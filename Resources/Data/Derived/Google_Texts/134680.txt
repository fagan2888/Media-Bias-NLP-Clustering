Sad news from the Smithsonian National Zoo: 7-year-old Shama, a female red panda, died this past Saturday following a sudden neurological disorder.

According to a press release, keepers first noticed something was wrong last Wednesday; when her condition worsened and neurological functioning continued to deteriorate, she was euthanized at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Va. A necropsy revealed severe cerebral edema, or swelling, which appears to have been caused by “encephalitis associated with a microscopic parasite.” Molecular testing is expected to reveal further information about the parasite.

Mate to Rusty, the male panda who made a famed zoo-break last year, Shama had given birth to three cubs earlier this summer. Officials say the rest of the family is doing all right:

Shama’s three cubs are now being hand-reared by experienced staff. Keepers are also hand-rearing a cub born to female Regan. Shama’s three cubs are active and appear to be doing well, but one is considerably smaller than its siblings, and receiving treatment for pneumonia. As a precaution, all three cubs are receiving anti-protozoal treatment. Rusty, who was housed with Shama and the cubs until recently, is also receiving anti-protozoal treatment as a preventative measure. He appears to be doing well.
