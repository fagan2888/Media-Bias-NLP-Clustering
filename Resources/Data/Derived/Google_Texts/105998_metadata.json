The Miami-based 3rd District Court of Appeal refused to invalidate a Monroe County judge\u2019s decision temporarily preventing a wedding for Aaron Huntsman and William Lee Jones and other gay couples. Circuit Judge Luis Garcia last week ruled that Florida\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional because it discriminates against gay couples and violates the federal 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantee of due process and equal protection under the law. Garcia\u2019s initial order said marriage licenses could be issued to gays in Monroe County beginning Tuesday. Attorney General Pam Bondi immediately filed notice of appeal, triggering an automatic stay that prevents any gay marriages until a potentially months-long appeals process is sorted out.

David Jolly\u2019s position on same sex marriage wasn\u2019t always entirely clear to people listening to him during his primary campaign against Kathleen Peters and general election campaign against Alex Sink, but some of his supporters say he could not have been clearer to them: He supported Florida\u2019s ban on same-sex marriage. Now that Jolly clarified his position to say he personally believes marriage should be between a man and woman but believes Florida should allow same-sex marriages, some of these supporters are \u201cprofoundly disappointed\u201d and calling on the Indian Shores Republican to apologize.

After a two-week trial, Leon Circuit Judge Terry Lewis earlier this month ruled two of Florida\u2019s 27-congressional districts were at odds with a constitutional amendment passed in 2010 that aimed to take politics out of the redistricting process. On the eve of a Thursday morning hearing set to decide what happens next, plaintiffs, led by the League of Women Voters of Florida, filed a motion asking Judge Terry Lewis to change the 2014 election dates to give the court time to draw new maps.

This week, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2016, pointed to two conflicting federal appeals court rulings over subsidies in President Barack Obama\u2019s federal health-care law and said it proved the law was badly written. On Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in a 2-1 decision that the IRS overextended subsidies for Americans who bought health care through the federal government\u2019s online marketplace.
