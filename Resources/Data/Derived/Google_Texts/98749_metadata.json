And he has no real plan to help them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m no special pleader for the super rich,\u201d she wrote in a Wednesday morning Facebook post. \u201cThey can take care of themselves, and Barack Obama has been the friend of every crony capitalist on Wall Street attending his $30,000-a-plate fundraisers. So, it\u2019s really galling to hear this President pretend to care about the little guy.\u201d\n\nShe then pushed for a flat tax and the repeal of job-killing legislation like Obamacare to really help middle-class families:\n\nLet\u2019s be honest. Tinkering in the margins of the tax code isn\u2019t going to bring lasting prosperity to America\u2019s middle class. Our tax code needs major reform. Mr. President, if you truly seek equality in the tax code, then let\u2019s talk about a flat tax. Let\u2019s get rid of all the loop holes carved out by the wealthy and politically connected. Bring us together to pass sensible flat tax legislation. Every American will thank you on tax day! The only people who will hate this are those who are benefitting from the current convoluted tax code with its thousands of special interest exemptions and carve-outs. Enough of this faux-populism about taxing the rich while protecting the broken tax code that benefits them. Mr. President, if you truly care about equality and fairness, give us a sensible flat tax. The tax code isn\u2019t the only thing standing in the way of prosperity in America. The middle class needs good paying jobs that can sustain a family. No American should be stuck in a entry level minimum wage job for their entire life. We want Americans to climb the economic ladder, not get stuck on the first rung. To create those good paying jobs, we need to address the problems standing in the way of job creation. We need to replace job-killing legislation like Obamacare, which has failed on every level by making health care more expensive for average Americans while providing them with less choices and worse care. We need to consider the consequences of policies like the 1,200 new regulations the Obama administration rammed through last month in the 15 days right before the new year \u2013 regulations that will cost the American taxpayer $181 billion in new fees and further stymie job growth. Ask yourself, is it easier today under Barack Obama\u2019s policies to open a business and hire people or is it harder? \u2018Nuff said.\n\nShe also called out Obama for not even mentioning the country\u2019s \u201cstaggering $18 trillion national debt\u201d and basically ignoring his \u201ccolossal and dangerous\u201d foreign policy failures:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sarah Palin Blasts Obama's Cronyism and 'Faux Populism'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Sarah Palin Blasts Obama's Cronyism and 'Faux Populism'", "title": "Sarah Palin Blasts Obama's Cronyism and 'Faux Populism' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Sarah-Palin-American-Flag-.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/01/21/sarah-palin-blasts-obamas-cronyism-and-faux-populism/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sarah Palin Blasts Obama's Cronyism and 'Faux Populism'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/01/Sarah-Palin-American-Flag-.jpg", "title": "Sarah Palin Blasts Obama's Cronyism and 'Faux Populism' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "barack obama, Crony Capitalism, Sarah Palin,Big Government,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Sarah Palin", "published_time": "2015-01-21T10:41:36-07:00", "categories": "Big Government"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe63ff\"", "article_summary": "Mr. President, if you truly seek equality in the tax code, then let\u2019s talk about a flat tax.\nTinkering in the margins of the tax code isn\u2019t going to bring lasting prosperity to America\u2019s middle class.\nBring us together to pass sensible flat tax legislation.\nEnough of this faux-populism about taxing the rich while protecting the broken tax code that benefits them.\nThe tax code isn\u2019t the only thing standing in the way of prosperity in America."}
