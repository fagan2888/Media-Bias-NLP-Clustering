Or maybe Napoleon, the littlest dictator with the outsized reputation for treachery.\n\nThen again, perhaps Caesar is a better fit; after all, there is a Senate betrayal involved, even if it isn\u2019t the Roman one he usurped. Or maybe a mafia enforcer works better: President Luca Brasi, perhaps?\n\nThe point is, it can be hard to tell which ruthless, iron-fisted, murderous autocrat we should keep in mind during the GOP\u2019s protests over immigration reform, a move which seems closer to humanitarian -- sort of -- than kill-your-own-people villainous, and one that didn\u2019t make all that many immigrants happy.\n\nFortunately, the New York Times has come to the rescue with a helpful guide to history\u2019s despots and the Republicans who have openly compared them to a sitting U.S. president. Perhaps having a visual guide will help the GOP settle on just the right imagery to describe a chief executive who sent them into apoplexy by doing\u2026 something at least two other chief executives have done in recent history.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Obama, Immigration and the GOP: What's Another Word for Tyrant?", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "It can be hard to tell which ruthless, iron-fisted, murderous autocrat we should keep in mind.", "title": "Obama, Immigration and the GOP: What's Another Word for Tyrant?", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/11/26/obama-immigration-and-the-gop-whats-another-word-for-tyrant", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/71/cf/f55ecd81404a9f8a52c9667153ad/thumb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Obama, Immigration and the GOP: What's Another Word for Tyrant?", "description": "It can be hard to tell which ruthless, iron-fisted, murderous autocrat we should keep in mind.<br>", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "Nov. 26, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Joseph P.
