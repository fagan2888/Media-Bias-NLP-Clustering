The Minneapolis public school system is combating discrimination by adopting a new policy that will require the suspension of any non-white students to be approved personally by the superintendent.

The change, beginning Monday, comes as the district approves a settlement with the U.S. Department of Education, which was investigating the district for discrimination. New data showed black students in Minneapolis are 10 times more likely to be suspended than white students, the Star Tribune reported.

Superintendent Bernadeia Johnson said she wants to “disrupt that in any way that I can.”

“The only way I can think of doing that is to take those suspensions back to the individuals and try and probe and ask questions,” she told the paper Friday.

The suspension of any non-white students will now have to be reviewed by Ms. Johnson, who is black, or someone else on her leadership team. She said the goal is to completely eliminate the racial suspension gap by 2018, the Star Tribune reported.

“Changing the trajectory for our students of color is a moral and ethical imperative, and our actions must be drastically different to achieve our goal of closing the achievement gap by 2020,” she said.

As part of the broader settlement, the school district will be required for the next three years to report its progress on reducing suspensions of non-white students to the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights, the Star Tribune reported.
