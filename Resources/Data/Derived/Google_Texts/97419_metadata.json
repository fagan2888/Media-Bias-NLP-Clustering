The returns will be prepared on Mondays and Thursdays from 5 to 9 p.m. at the Lannom Memorial Public Library, 312 N. Collins St, in Tullahoma. The service is sponsored by the IRS and locally administered by the South Central Human Resources Agency\n\nTo make an appointment call Zak Mohyuddin at 931-409-3602.\n\nAll volunteers are IRS-certified tax preparers, and must take and pass the various tests annually. In addition to the basic and advanced levels, some volunteers are certified to prepare military returns and those involving health savings accounts. This year, the volunteers have also received training with the income tax aspects of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTaxpayers should bring Social Security cards including those for dependents to avoid refund delays caused by name and number mismatches. Returns are normally filed electronically with direct deposit of refunds. Option to file paper returns by mail are also available.\n\nA summary of important tax information for those who purchased health insurance through the Marketplace/Exchange in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act is provided in the following paragraphs. This does not affect those who had employer-provided or government insurance (e.g. Medicaid/Medicare) or veterans insurance, etc.\n\nA new form, called Form-1095-A, will be sent to all taxpayers who purchased health insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace. The form will be needed to claim possible tax credit to offset the cost of insurance premium, or to reconcile the credit on their returns with advance credit payments.\n\nPurchasers with income level ranging from federal poverty level to 4-times this level are eligible to receive tax credit on a sliding scale to offset the cost of insurance premium. The current federal poverty level (for the 48-contigous states) is household income of $11,490 for a single person household, $15,510 for family of two, $23,550 for family of four, etc. Those with up to four times these incomes may be eligible for tax credit to offset the premium.\n\nConversely, those who did not carry health insurance, and are not eligible for certain exemptions from carrying insurance will make a payment called the shared responsibility payment in their tax returns.\n\nAnyone who received an advance credit must file income tax return even if their income is otherwise too low to file. Income information will be required for all members of the household who are listed as dependents and who are required to file taxes.\n\nThe Tullahoma site has been made available for this service for the past eight years courtesy of the Tullahoma Lannom Library. Each year over 200 returns are prepared and filed. This is the only VITA site in Coffee County.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "DSuZnC9hJQAMvp9aACU2GR1smwoMgHv-RH5LWmQ0SkM", "generator": "WordPress 4.2.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd12dd\"", "article_summary": "A new form, called Form-1095-A, will be sent to all taxpayers who purchased health insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace.\nThe Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program is offering free help to area residents to fill out their 2014 income tax returns.\nAnyone who received an advance credit must file income tax return even if their income is otherwise too low to file.\nThose with up to four times these incomes may be eligible for tax credit to offset the premium.\nThis year, the volunteers have also received training with the income tax aspects of the Affordable Care Act."}
