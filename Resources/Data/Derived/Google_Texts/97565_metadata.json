One of them asks the rest, \u201cOkay, is it possible to imagine a candidate who is so manifestly unqualified, so frightening to imagine in the Oval Office, that if he or she got the nomination, you would vote for the Democrat instead?\u201d\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Donald Trump\u2019s Lies May Be Good for U.S. Politics\n\nThere would be plenty of vows that ANYBODY would be better than a Democrat. But if the issue were pressed, most reasonable people would concede that somewhere near the bottom of the Republican barrel, there must be someone who would actually be worse than a run-of-the-mill Democrat.\n\nThe same experiment could be repeated with a bunch of boozy Democrats, and it would likely have the same result. Protests that ANYBODY is better than a Republican would eventually give way to agreement that somewhere in Democratic party, there must be someone who\u2019d be a worse president than a mainstream Republican.\n\nThe difference is that right now the GOP is hurtling toward a real-life version of the thought experiment.\n\nRelated: Trump turns to Race-Baiting and 9/11 Fantasies\n\nThis was made clear on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation Sunday, when former Florida governor Jeb Bush was asked about Trump. Bush, the brother and son of two former presidents, has been among the most forceful of Trump\u2019s critics within the ranks of the GOP\u2019s slate of candidates. He spent a considerable amount of time enumerating his rival\u2019s shortcomings:\n\n\u201cLook, I just think he\u2019s uninformed ... He knows what he\u2019s saying. He\u2019s smart. He\u2019s playing you guys like a fiddle \u2013 the press \u2013 by saying outrageous things and garnering attention. That\u2019s his strategy \u2026 to dominate the news.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe simple fact is that he\u2019s been wrong on Syria, and on the refugees, pretty consistently, and no one\u2019s holding him to account. \u201c\n\n\u201c[I]n these serious times, he\u2019s not a serious leader.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have grave doubts about Donald Trump\u2019s ability to be commander in chief. I really do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt to see how the campaign unfolded, but you listen to him talk, it\u2019s kind of scary to be honest with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk about the issues at hand that are of national security importance for our country to keep us safe is the first priority of the president, and he\u2019s all over the map. He\u2019s misinformed at best and playing on peoples\u2019 fear at worst.\u201d\n\nRelated: Donald Trump\u2019s 8 (Most Recent) Blatant Lies\n\nAsked by host John Dickerson to justify his promise that he would still support Trump if the billionaire former reality television star were to win the nomination, Bush immediately fell back on the old standard.\n\n\u201cBecause anybody\u2019s better than Hillary Clinton, let me be clear about that,\u201d he said.\n\nPressed further, Bush wouldn\u2019t explain why a man who he had previously said he wouldn\u2019t trust with the nuclear weapons launch codes would be a better president that Clinton, the former secretary of state and the current Democratic frontrunner, he defaulted to the assumption that Trump won\u2019t win the nomination.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let the voters decide on Donald Trump,\u201d said Bush. \u201cI\u2019m pretty confident that the more they hear of him, the less likely it is that he\u2019s going to get the Republican nomination.\u201d\n\nRelated: Is Trump on a Slippery Slope to Fascism?\n\nThe same strategy was on display on ABC\u2019s This Week, when Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who, like Bush, has been more direct in attacking Trump than many of his fellow candidates. Nevertheless, Kasich avoided answering host Martha Raddatz\u2019s repeated questions about whether he would support Trump if he got the GOP nomination.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to,\u201d Kasich insisted. \u201cSo we\u2019re not even going to go there.\u201d\n\nThe reason behind the reluctance of GOP candidates to say they wouldn\u2019t support Trump is obvious. The loudmouthed billionaire\u2019s counterattacks are vicious and effective. He has between 25 and 30 percent support in national polls, and if he eventually drops out, candidates like Bush and Kasich hope they can pick up some of his supporters. Plus, an admission that they would vote for a Democrat under any circumstances would immediately be turned against them by their opponents in attack ads and on the debate stage.\n\nOn the other hand, in a campaign where traditional politicians like Bush and Kasich have struggled to find traction, a principled stand against a potential nominee that both seem to find unfit for the presidency would show leadership and might actually inspire some support among the 70 to 75 percent of GOP voters who aren\u2019t currently in the Trump camp.\n\nThe choice between Trump and a Democrat is clearly one both men hope they never have to make, but taking a stand on the issue now could help prevent the thought experiment from becoming reality.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "With Donald Trump continuing to dominate the field, the Republican presidential primary is beginning to resemble a thought experiment gone awry.", "title": "Bush: Trump Is Wrong and Scary, but Still Better than Clinton", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/29/Bush-Trump-Wrong-and-Scary-Still-Better-Clinton", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/donald_trump_jeb_bush_split.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/29/Bush-Trump-Wrong-and-Scary-Still-Better-Clinton", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/donald_trump_jeb_bush_split.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "With Donald Trump continuing to dominate the field, the Republican presidential primary is beginning to resemble a thought experiment gone awry.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "With Donald Trump continuing to dominate the field, the Republican presidential primary is beginning to resemble a thought experiment gone awry.\n\u201cI\u2019ll let the voters decide on Donald Trump,\u201d said Bush.\n\u201cSo we\u2019re not even going to go there.\u201dThe reason behind the reluctance of GOP candidates to say they wouldn\u2019t support Trump is obvious.\nNevertheless, Kasich avoided answering host Martha Raddatz\u2019s repeated questions about whether he would support Trump if he got the GOP nomination.\nRelated: Trump turns to Race-Baiting and 9/11 FantasiesThis was made clear on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation Sunday, when former Florida governor Jeb Bush was asked about Trump."}
