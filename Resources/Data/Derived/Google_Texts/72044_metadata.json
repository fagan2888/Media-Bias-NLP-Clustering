After examining dozens of studies, researchers from the University of Cambridge found tableware and package size can play a role in how much food a person consumes. Their findings, published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, reveal how this influence affects everybody, regardless of their weight, gender, or age.\n\n\u201cPeople see someone who\u2019s overweight and may presume they have no control over what they do, and [that] they just overeat,\u201d the study\u2019s co-author Dr. Gareth Hollands, a senior researcher of health psychology at the University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, told Medical Daily. \u201cIt might be nice to think it\u2019s all decided by people\u2019s conscious choices to go ahead and do something, but we\u2019ve actually seen all these environmental factors and external cues, including package and plate sizes that are extremely important to shaping our eating behavior.\u201d\n\nHollands and his colleagues looked at results from 61 studies, which included 6,711 participants who ate in a variety of different real world environments. They found that reducing the size of portions, packages, and tableware in a person\u2019s everyday diet could cut 22 to 29 percent of their daily calories \u2014 an average of 527 calories each day. \u201cIt was surprising how consistent the effect seemed to be considering packaging and tableware had a substantially similar effect on children and adults, whether they were male or female, overweight, or had different levels of self-control,\u201d Hollands said. \u201cThe indications so far point that this has a robust effect across the population.\u201d\n\nSize isn\u2019t the only factor that affects how much a person consumes; price does, too. And although the researchers analyzed studies that focused on how much a person ate from their plate rather than how much they were willing to spend in relation to their eating habits, the findings could suggest pricing plays a part. Buying food in bulk costs less and is financially more sensible than opting for smaller portions, even though it comes with caloric consequences. One way to decrease the likelihood of overeating, the researchers said, could be to limit the savings consumers get from buying in bulk.\n\nWhen burritos become as big as your head, they set a consumer up to believe they\u2019re getting a better deal, according to Cornell Food Scientist Brian Wansink\u2019s recent book Slim by Design. But the more-calories-per-dollar method doesn\u2019t benefit the customer\u2019s health or the food industry\u2019s bottom line. Wansink referred to a Chinese buffet owner who switched out his 11-inch plates for 9-inch plates and found customers took less food, wasted less, ate less, and cost the restaurant less.\n\nLittle tricks like this won\u2019t deter customers, either. In one study, Wansink and his colleagues found that when they reduced the size of plates, people rated the food as a better value even though there was 15 percent less food on their plate. It just appeared there was more food, which in turn left customers more satisfied with their meals, leading Wansink and his team to say more food doesn\u2019t necessarily lead a customer to believe they\u2019ve gotten a better deal.\n\n\"At the moment, it is all too easy \u2014 and often better value for money \u2014 for us to eat or drink too much,\" said the study\u2019s co-author Dr. Ian Shemilt, a senior behavior and health researcher at the University of Cambridge, in a press release. \"The evidence is compelling. Reducing the size, availability, and appeal of large servings can make a difference to the amounts people eat and drink. We hope that our findings will provide fresh impetus for discussions on how this can be achieved in a range of public sector and commercial settings.\"\n\nSource: Hollands GJ, Schemilt I, Marteau TM, et al.
