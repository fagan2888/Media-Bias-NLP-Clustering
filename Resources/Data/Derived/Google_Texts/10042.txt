Major surgical errors often involve a series of nine separate missteps--including overconfidence of surgeons and nurses as well as a focus on the minute details of the procedure that cause clinicians to lose sight of the big picture--according to a study conducted by researchers at the Mayo Clinic.

The research, published in the journal Surgery, examined surgical "never events," which include performing the wrong procedure on a patient or leaving a surgical instrument inside a patient's body, that should never happen and yet continue to occur at facilities across the United States.

The research team, led by Julianne Bingener, M.D., a gastroenterologic surgeon at Mayo Clinic, used human factors analysis to identify 69 never events, including surgery on the wrong person, the wrong site or the wrong side of body, among 1.5 million invasive procedures performed over five years at the organization and detailed why each occurred. They found 628 human factors contributed to the errors overall, roughly four to nine per event.

Nearly two-thirds of the Mayo never events occurred during relatively minor procedures such as anesthetic blocks, line placements, interventional radiology procedures, endoscopy and other skin and soft tissue procedures
