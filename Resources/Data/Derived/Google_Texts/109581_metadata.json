Mine will. Whether it was banning Obamacare-funded abortions, blocking attempts to repeal Stand Your Ground, cutting taxes by over $1 Billion, or supporting military families, I\u2019ve been an effective leader in the Florida House. I\u2019m ready to fight and win for Northwest Florida in Congress,\u201d he continued.\n\nMatt Gaetz is an attorney from Fort Walton Beach and represents portions of Okaloosa County in the Florida House of Representatives.
