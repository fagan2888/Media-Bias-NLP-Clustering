For a variety of industries \u2013 including the automotive, financial, and energy sectors \u2013 this is no small story.\n\nBut as it turns out, some in the political world took note, too.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Energy noted on Twitter, for example, that the new Tesla model is cool, \u201cbut did you know that Energy Dept. loans helped jumpstart the Model S?\u201d\n\nActually, yes. For all the arguments from the right that the federal government shouldn\u2019t intervene in the private marketplace, Tesla\u2019s success was driven in part by the Obama administration, which loaned the auto company $465 million through the Energy Department.
