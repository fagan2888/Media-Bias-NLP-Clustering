Fiskars Buys PE-Backed Wedgwood China-Owner, as Luxury Goods Deals Flourish

Luxury businesses Net-a-Porter, Mytheresa and Frette have also acquired recently

Fiskars is buying private equity-backed WWRD Holdings Ltd. for $432 million.

Staffordshire, England-based WWRD provides luxury home and lifestyle products from the Waterford, Wedgwood, Royal Doulton, Royal Albert and Rogaska brands. The company also has licensing agreements to sell lifestyle products from Vera Wang, Jasper Conran, Monique Lhullier, John Rocha, Gordon Ramsay, Donna Hay, Miranda Kerr, Jo Sampson, Barber and Osgerby.

The products are sold through 76 WWRD-owned stores, and 150 concession stores, as well as luxury and premium department stores and specialty retailers.

WWRD was created by private equity firm KPS Capital Partners in 2009 when the firm bought assets from Waterford Wedgwood Worldwide after the company went into receivership. KPS recapitalized the group in 2013. The New York firm invests in manufacturing companies and restructuring situations. KPS has about $5.7 billion in assets under management.

Fiskars, headquartered in Helsinki, Finland, owns home brands Iittala Group Ltd., Royal Copenhagen A/S, Rorstrand and Arabia. The company says the acquisition helps it grow its lifestyle products portfolio and grow its U.S. presence. William Blair advised the company on the deal.

There have been several deals in the luxury space recently, including Yoox SpA's acquisition of luxury e-commerce business Net-a-Porter. Before that, Neiman Marcus Group Ltd. bought another luxury e-commerce site, Mytheresa.com. In July, Change Capital Partners bought a majority stake in Frette, an Italian provider of luxury linens.
