In addition, 250 clinicians who had recently treated patients for depression in the United States were polled.\n\nPatients were recruited to reflect the age, gender, and education level of the population of U.S. adults suffering from depression. Clinicians surveyed had an average of 15 years of professional experience and included therapists, psychiatrists and primary care physicians.\n\nIn addition to whether a treatment would work, patients wanted to know about potential side effects, whether a treatment was covered by insurance, how long before it took effect and how much it would cost.\n\nClinicians were asked to rank their information priorities about a potential treatment from their professional perspective as a clinician as well as to identify what they believed their patients would consider most important when making a treatment decision.\n\n\u201cWhat we found is although many health care providers realize that their patients want to know how much a particular treatment costs and if insurance will cover it, they don\u2019t seem to cover these topics with their patients.\u201d\n\nResearchers believe the lack of communication on these topics could be attributed to time limitations during a clinical visit, the difficulties of identifying patient-specific costs and a belief that medical decisions should be based exclusively on needs, not costs.\n\nBarr also noted that \u201cthe cost of treatment has a significant impact on a patient\u2019s financial stability, which can impact their well-being and whether they actually begin a treatment, especially if they cannot afford it.\u201d\n\nIn the second part of their study, Barr and his co-authors, Rachel Forcino, Manish Mishra, Rachel Blitzer and Glyn Elwyn, asked patient-respondents to answer a three-question CollaboRATE survey about their most recent clinic visit where depression was discussed.\n\nQuestions included how much effort they felt was made to help them understand their health issues and how well they felt the clinician listened to what was important to them regarding their health issues and next steps.\n\nThe responses were revealing as only 18 percent of respondents reported a high level of perceived shared decision making with their clinician, while the majority perceived a lower level of shared decision making.\n\nThe study\u2019s authors note that better equipping clinicians to talk to consumers about the cost and insurance coverage associated with different treatment options could lead to more \u201cengaged and empowered consumers.\u201d The findings are salient given the expansion of mental health coverage and depression screening under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTo do this, researchers are developing decision support intervention tools (DESIs) \u2014 such as Option Grids decision aids \u2014 to help increase shared decision making among people with depression and practitioners. The goal is to reduce the information gap between consumers and clinicians.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot that could be done to help patients and health care providers communicate more effectively and to ultimately help people with depression get the treatment they want,\u201d Barr said.\n\nSource: Dartmouth University\n\n\n\nWoman in therapy photo by shutterstock.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers have discovered clinical treatment for depression does not take into account patient priorities in areas of cost and insurance information.
