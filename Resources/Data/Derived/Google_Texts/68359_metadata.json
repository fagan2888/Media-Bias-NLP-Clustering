Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, is furious.\n\n\"Here were the top people doing what no other citizen can do,\u201d Jordan told Fox. \u201cYou underreport income, you don't pay your taxes, you can't get away with it. And yet the very people who run the IRS were doing just that.\"\n\nThe IRS issued a statement saying, \"Cutting costs is a top priority, and the IRS has put in place a number of steps to reduce expenses involving executive travel. The IRS agreed with (the Inspector General report\u2019s) recommendations and has put in place new steps to prevent future issues in this area.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the IRS has been complaining about a lack of resources.\n\nThe Obama administration sought $13 billion for the 2014 IRS budget, but Congress slashed it to $11.3 billion.\n\nThe number of audits, which generate revenue, has dropped, with less than 1% now facing extra scrutiny.\n\nNew IRS Commissioner John Koskinen told lawmakers earlier this month the lack of funding is having an impact on service to the taxpayers.\n\n\"I can guarantee you, that we would answer more calls, if we had more people. I can guarantee you we don't have the people because we don't have the funding,\" Koskinen told members of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Oversight.\n\nAnd now the agency is working on implementing ObamaCare.\n\n\"Those are very significant duties for the service, and in an era of tightened resources, frankly, everything else gets squeezed,\u201d former IRS Commissioner Mark Everson told Fox.\n\n\"That's going to be a very daunting moment for them, let alone the enforcement mechanisms, so that's going to be\u2026 navigating that is going to be very delicate for the service. Particularly of the fact that this law is so, well, it's so controversial,\" said Everson.\n\n\"Now they're going to have a greater role in ObamaCare?\u201d Jordan asked. \u201cWith a website that's not secure and all the problems we've already seen with this, with this legislation? Certainly doesn't instill a lot of confidence in the minds of taxpayers and citizens across the country.\"\n\nMike Emanuel currently serves as chief congressional correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC).
