This opinion piece kills me. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, brother of Rahm, is a former senior health care adviser to President Obama. Now he writes a piece in The New York Times telling people to skip their annual physical. It says, “Most think of it as the human equivalent of a 15,000-mile checkup and fluid change, which can uncover hidden problems and ensure longer engine life.”

“There is only one problem: From a health perspective, the annual physical exam is basically worthless.”

Ezekiel Emanuel

Remember the 2008 sales pitch about how universal health care would mean regular doctor visits that would keep people healthier and hence out of the pricey emergency room? That’s how Obamacare would cover more people without driving up costs — that was the con-job argument anyway. In that spirit, the Affordable Care Act considers the annual physical to be an “essential benefit” for which there is no co-payment.

President Obama said in a 2009 talk:

But one of the areas where we can potentially see some saving is a lot of those patients are being seen in the emergency room anyway, and if we are increasing prevention, if we are increasing wellness programs, we’re reducing the amount of emergency room care, then that frees up doctors and resources to provide the kind of primary care that will keep people healthier, but also allow them to see more patients and hopefully give more time to patients, as well.

And:

They know how to manage chronic diseases in an effective way, so that we have people who are getting regular checkups, if they’re trying to manage diabetes, as opposed to us paying for a $30,000 foot amputation because we didn’t manage the disease properly.

Now that the annual physical is free, Emanuel says it’s worthless. So do the taxpayers a favor and forget about it.
