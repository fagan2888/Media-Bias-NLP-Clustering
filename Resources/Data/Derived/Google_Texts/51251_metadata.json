The Andersons are a married couple.\n\nAn arraignment is scheduled for Feb. 24. Many of those in custody are appearing this week for detention hearings in U.S. District Court in Portland.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal grand jury has indicted 16 people on conspiracy stemming from the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns, Oregon, including four people still holed up at the property.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A federal grand jury has indicted 16 people on conspiracy stemming from the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns, Oregon, including four people still holed up at the property.", "title": "Grand jury indicts 16 in Oregon standoff, including Bundy brothers, four holdouts", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/4/grand-jury-indicts-16-oregon-standoff-including-bu/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/30/Ranching_Standoff.JPEG-05f0d.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/01/30/Ranching_Standoff.JPEG-05f0d.jpg", "description": "A federal grand jury has indicted 16 people on conspiracy stemming from the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns, Oregon, including four people still holed up at the property.", "card": "summary", "title": "Grand jury indicts 16 in Oregon standoff, including Bundy brothers, fo"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, War Conflict"}, "article_summary": "A federal grand jury has indicted 16 people on conspiracy stemming from the occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge near Burns, Oregon, including four people still holed up at the property.\nOne occupier, Jon Ritzheimer, turned himself in later that day to authorities in Phoenix, Arizona.\nMany of those in custody are appearing this week for detention hearings in U.S. District Court in Portland.\nThe four who remain at the refuge and were also indicted are Sean Anderson, David Lee Fry, Jeff Wayne Banta and Sandra Lynn Pfeifer Anderson.\nNamed along with the Bundy brothers and Mr. Ritzheimer are Joseph O\u2019Shaughnessy, Ryan Payne, Brian Cavalier, Shawna Cox, Peter Santilli, Jason Patrick, Duane Leo Ehmer, Dylan Anderson and Kenneth Medenbach."}
