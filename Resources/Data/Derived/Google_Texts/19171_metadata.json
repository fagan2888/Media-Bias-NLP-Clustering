The regulations range from new restrictions on high-powered pistols to gun storage requirements. Chief among them is a renewed effort to keep guns out of the hands of people who are mentally unstable or have been convicted of domestic abuse. Gun safety advocates have been calling for such reforms since the Sandy Hook school shooting nearly three years ago in Newtown, Conn. They say keeping guns away from dangerous people is of primary importance. But the gun lobby contends that such a sweeping ban would unfairly root out a number of prospective gun owners who are not a danger to society. . . . The Justice Department plans to issue new rules expanding criteria for people who do not qualify for gun ownership, according to the recently released Unified Agenda, which is a list of rules that federal agencies are developing. Some of the rules come in response to President Obama\u2019s call to reduce gun violence in the wake of Sandy Hook. He issued 23 executive actions shortly after the shooting aimed at keeping guns away from dangerous people, and some of those items remain incomplete. . . . The Justice Department\u2019s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) is looking to revive a rule proposed way back in 1998 that would block domestic abusers from owning guns. As proposed, the regulation makes it illegal for some who has been convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense to own a gun.\n\nThe ATF plans to finalize the rule by November, according to the Unified Agenda.\n\nBut gun rights advocates are concerned the Obama administration will use this rule to unfairly target certain gun owners.\n\n\u201cThat could be a person who spanked his kid, or yelled at his wife, or slapped her husband,\u201d warned Michael Hammond, legislative counsel for the Gun Owners of America. . . .\n\nThe ATF is also looking to prohibit the mentally ill from owning firearms, which is attracting even more criticism from gun rights groups.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration is trying very hard to disqualify people from owning a gun on the basis that they are seeing a psychologist,\u201d Hammond argued.\n\nThe NRA contends that many people who are mentally ill may not necessarily pose a danger to society \u2014 or as the gun lobby puts it, the policy \u201csnares masses of mostly harmless individuals.\u201d\n\nGun rights advocates argue it would be more effective to ban people on an individual basis, as opposed to banning all people who are mentally ill.\n\n\u201cA person who experienced a temporary reaction to a traumatic event or who has trouble handling household finances may well be treated the same as a violent psychopath,\u201d the NRA wrote.\n\n\u201cNot only is this unjust and stigmatizing, it creates disincentives for those who need mental health treatment to seek it, increasing whatever risks are associated with untreated mental illness,\u201d it added.\n\nAside from these issues, some gun rights advocates have also raised concerns about upcoming ATF rules that would require gun dealers to report gun thefts, provide gun storage and safety devices, and place restrictions on high-powered pistols, among other things.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Cranach", "description": "The Justice Department is moving ahead with a new round of gun control regulations implemented by the President\u2019s executive order, to be enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, \u2026", "title": "More gun control by executive order", "url": "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/geneveith/2015/06/more-gun-control-by-executive-order/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-01T09:46:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-31T20:00:24+00:00"}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,patheos.mkt5005.com,www.patheos.com", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "twitter": {"card": "summary"}}, "article_summary": "But gun rights advocates are concerned the Obama administration will use this rule to unfairly target certain gun owners.\nAside from these issues, some gun rights advocates have also raised concerns about upcoming ATF rules that would require gun dealers to report gun thefts, provide gun storage and safety devices, and place restrictions on high-powered pistols, among other things.\nbyThe Justice Department is moving ahead with a new round of gun control regulations implemented by the President\u2019s executive order, to be enforced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF).\nThe ATF is also looking to prohibit the mentally ill from owning firearms, which is attracting even more criticism from gun rights groups.\nGun safety advocates have been calling for such reforms since the Sandy Hook school shooting nearly three years ago in Newtown, Conn."}
