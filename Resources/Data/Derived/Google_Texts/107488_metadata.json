In a painful interview with The Daily Sentinel this weekend, Sen. Michael Bennett (D) basically said that consumers in western and central Colorado, who face the most expensive health plans in the country, are out of luck.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have answers for Grand Junction, but I\u2019m aware of the problem,\u201d he said.\n\nBecause Obamacare lowered the threshold for Medicaid and allowed working-age adults to reap the program's benefits, it doubled enrollment in Colorado from 358,000 to 721,000, explains The Colorado Statesman. The financial consequences were not pretty.\n\nAs a result, general fund spending on Medicaid grew from $1.15 billion in 2009-10 to $2.67 billion in 2016-17. Add to that nearly $1.5 billion from the \u201chospital provider fee\u201d and matching federal funds. Total spending on the department that oversees Medicaid has grown to more than $9 billion \u2014 fully one-third of all money spent by the State of Colorado.\n\nBennet is simply left speechless.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is also having trouble answering voters' questions as to why their premiums keep going up. At a campaign stop in Virginia on Monday, one concerned mother who earns a decent salary asked Clinton how lower income families can expect to pay for health care when she's even struggling to make payments. Clinton was just as puzzled as she was.\n\n\"Like, people shouldn\u2019t just once they get to a certain income, lose all subsidy or lose all tax benefit or whatever else we could piece together that would enable you to make this more affordable for yourself,\" Clinton responded. \"So that\u2019s something I\u2019m looking at. I think that the Affordable Care Act is a big step forward for the vast majority of Americans, but we have to look at out of pocket costs, copays, deductibles, premiums, and we have to make the insurance companies justify what they are charging because a lot of them are moving costs up without really explaining, at least not to my satisfaction, why that\u2019s happening.\"\n\nThe solution escaped her.\n\n\"What could have possibly raised your costs $400?\" she asked. \"And that\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nAt least we all agree on that.\n\nWith Democrats now admitting they can't answer for Obamacare\u2019s rising costs, will the issue make or break them in the November elections?", "article_metadata": {"description": "No answers..05/26/2016 20:43:04PM EST.", "author": "Cortney O'Brien", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "No answers.", "title": "Dem Colorado Senator Admits He Has No Answers on Rising Obamacare Costs", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/05/10/dem-colorado-senator-admits-he-has-no-answers-on-rising-obamacare-costs-n2160278", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/5/9/2.png", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "No answers.", "title": "Dem Colorado Senator Admits He Has No Answers on Rising Obamacare Costs", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/cortneyobrien/2016/05/10/dem-colorado-senator-admits-he-has-no-answers-on-rising-obamacare-costs-n2160278", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/5/9/2.png", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Cringe: Dem Colorado Senator Admits He Has No Answers on Rising Obamacare Costs, But He's 'Aware' Of It, Cortney O'Brien, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "One Colorado politician was unusually candid about the rising health care costs Americans can expect as the president\u2019s Affordable Care Act goes into full effect.\nAs a result, general fund spending on Medicaid grew from $1.15 billion in 2009-10 to $2.67 billion in 2016-17.\nWith Democrats now admitting they can't answer for Obamacare\u2019s rising costs, will the issue make or break them in the November elections?\n\u201cI don\u2019t have answers for Grand Junction, but I\u2019m aware of the problem,\u201d he said.\nBecause Obamacare lowered the threshold for Medicaid and allowed working-age adults to reap the program's benefits, it doubled enrollment in Colorado from 358,000 to 721,000, explains The Colorado Statesman."}
