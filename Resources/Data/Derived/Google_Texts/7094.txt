Sioux Falls, SD

On a weekend where everyone is Irish, a little snow didn't keep crowds away from the St. Patrick’s Day Parade.

Thousands line the streets of Downtown Sioux Falls today for a tradition 35 years in the making. Whether in the parade or taking part in the festivities - children, adults and even man’s best friend dawn their best Irish green in celebration of the day.

“It’s a tradition. And some days it’s hot, like a couple years ago it was really hot. This year it’s snowing so you just never know what you are going to get but it’s always good,” Jeaneen Mclaren said.

Mclaren has collected a number of Saint Patties day pins over the almost three decades she has attended. If you missed out on the afternoons festivities it’s not too late. You can watch a recording of the parade attached to this story.
