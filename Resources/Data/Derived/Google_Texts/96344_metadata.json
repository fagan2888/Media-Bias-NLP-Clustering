Rubio opposes legalizing gay marriage and supports the right of Christian business owners to refuse service for a gay wedding (although not to gay customers generally), positions informed by his religious belief that marriage is a sacred commitment between men and women. If you believe that, though, then why agree to participate in a gay wedding ceremony yourself by attending? Rubio\u2019s answer, as always, is savvy, and effective in no small part because of its simplicity: \u201cHow you treat a person that you care for and love is different from what your opinion is or what your faith teaches marriage should be.\u201d And he has an example at the ready to back it up, noting that Catholics routinely attend weddings for friends who are marrying for the second time despite the Church\u2019s prohibition on divorce. It\u2019s a nice example of his political talent and why I think he\u2019s the safest pick in the GOP field. Even a curveball question like this, designed to trap him between social conservatives on the right and the rest of the pro-SSM electorate to his left, is deftly handled despite the fact that he almost certainly didn\u2019t prepare for it. And politically it\u2019s the correct answer, of course. He\u2019s already banked some social-con cred by lining up with them on SSM policy; now, to preserve his status as one of the most \u201celectable\u201d candidates in the field, he needs to make it harder for Democrats to demagogue him as anti-gay in the general election. Voila.\n\nBut back to my original question. Is this the correct \u201cconservative answer\u201d? What would the social-con consensus be on whether to attend a gay wedding? I honestly have no idea. In fact, neither do some social cons:\n\nOn today\u2019s \u201c700 Club,\u201d Pat Robertson took a question from a viewer who sought his advice on whether she and her husband should attend their gay child\u2019s upcoming wedding, which Robertson predictably urged them not to do. The viewer said that while one parent was adamant about not attending \u201cbecause it\u2019s against the Lord\u2019s plan,\u201d the other felt that they should attend in order to show support and love for their child. In the past, Roberson has been very clear that Christians should not attend gay weddings and he repeated that advice today. \u201cYou don\u2019t agree with it. You\u2019ve got to stand there and be a witness to it,\u201d Robertson said. \u201cBy your attendance at the ceremony, you are agreeing with it \u2026 I just wouldn\u2019t go. I would tell your child, \u2018I love you but I cannot condone this. We will always love you but I don\u2019t condone this activity.'\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the issue in a nutshell. Most Republican candidates will agree with Rubio on this, I suspect, especially the \u201celectable\u201d ones like Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, but I wonder if he\u2019ll be hit from the right on it in the primaries by Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum. Huckabee\u2019s used rhetoric similar to Rubio\u2019s to defend his friendship with gays (\u201cPeople can be my friends who have lifestyles that are not necessarily my lifestyles. I don\u2019t shut people out of my circle or out of my life because they have a different point of view.\u201d) but maintaining a friendship and participating in a ritual that offends your faith are two different things. That\u2019s the whole point of the religious-liberty argument against forcing businesses to cater gay weddings.\n\nBy the way, the guy putting this question to Rubio is Jorge Ramos, star anchor at Univision, a network Rubio has correctly identified in the past as being in the tank for ObamaCare (and immigration reform too, of course). This interview is for Fusion, a subsidiary of Univision, but the fact that Rubio was willing to grant it shows he intends to make a strong play for Latino voters by engaging them through their favorite media outlets. Also savvy, needless to say.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cHow you treat a person that you care for and love is different from what your \u2026 faith teaches marriage should be.\u201d", "title": "Marco Rubio: Sure, I\u2019d attend a friend\u2019s gay wedding", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/04/16/marco-rubio-sure-id-attend-a-friends-gay-wedding/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@allahpundit"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "keywords": "freedom, fusion, gay, GOP, jorge ramos, Marco Rubio, marriage, religious, republican, wedding,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-16T15:21:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-16T16:22:03+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd111c\"", "article_summary": "If you believe that, though, then why agree to participate in a gay wedding ceremony yourself by attending?\nIn the past, Roberson has been very clear that Christians should not attend gay weddings and he repeated that advice today.\nWhat would the social-con consensus be on whether to attend a gay wedding?\nRubio opposes legalizing gay marriage and supports the right of Christian business owners to refuse service for a gay wedding (although not to gay customers generally), positions informed by his religious belief that marriage is a sacred commitment between men and women.\nMarco Rubio: Sure, I\u2019d attend a friend\u2019s gay weddingposted at 11:21 am on April 16, 2015 by AllahpunditNot only have I never heard this specific question put to a top Republican, I\u2019m not even sure what the \u201cconservative answer\u201d should be."}
