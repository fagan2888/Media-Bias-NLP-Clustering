What good is health insurance coverage if you can’t afford to actually use it?

Unfortunately, that’s not a rhetorical question. It’s one facing thousands of Californians who are required to purchase health insurance through Affordable Care Act exchanges. As if rising premiums – which increased across California this year – weren’t already hard enough, skyrocketing deductibles have rendered many plans “all but useless,” according to a recent report in the New York Times.

And, as a new analysis from my organization shows, it’s only getting worse.

While premiums are what it costs to have insurance, deductibles are what it costs to use it. Especially for low- and middle-income families, these out-of-pocket costs are placing affordable health care further out of reach.

My organization recently completed an analysis of deductibles across the country, including in California. Relying on data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the federal agency overseeing the Affordable Care Act, we calculated weighted average deductibles by enrollment across gold, silver and bronze plans.

Here’s the short version: It’s not good.

All three categories increased by an average of $362, or 14.5 percent, in California this year. Silver plans – whichm with 862,000 enrollees, are the most popular in the state – now have deductibles averaging $2,245, while bronze plan deductibles average $5,323.

In other words, the 1.2 million Californians with silver and bronze plans will pay $2,245 to $5,323 before their health insurance coverage kicks in.

That’s not an option for many families. A December survey by Bankrate.com found only 37 percent of Americans have the savings to pay for an unexpected expense of even $1,000. Others said they’d add it to credit cards, borrow from family or friends or slash spending from other areas of their budgets.

What’s more is insurance premiums are increasing at the same time. A similar analysis by my organization found premiums for individual exchange plans increased across the Golden State this year. So not only is it more expensive to purchase insurance, but it’s also more expensive to use it.

And there’s the real rub of health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Consumers have increasingly fewer options and control over how they spend their health care dollars. Instead, they’re forced to purchase insurance policies from government exchanges whose premiums they cannot afford, and whose deductibles limit their use.

It’s important to note that higher deductibles by themselves are not bad. Some Californians may actually prefer high-deductible plans as a way to lower their premiums upfront, or to assume more responsibility for their costs as they need it. But as we’re seeing, the Affordable Care Act is denying consumers those choices – and forcing them to pay higher costs all the way around.

While some may instinctively blame insurance companies for these rising costs – after all, they’re the ones mailing the bills – they’re losing money, too. UnitedHealth, one of the nation’s largest insurers, announced losses of nearly $1 billion in 2015 and 2016 on the exchanges. The outlook is so bad that they and other insurers are even considering leaving the exchanges altogether next year, which may result in millions of canceled plans.

Rather, these higher costs are the result of a one-size-fits-all federal health care law that treats every patient as if they were the same. First it was millions of canceled plans. Then it was – and still is – higher premiums. Now it’s sky-high deductibles making health insurance too expensive to use.

It’s always something else with the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately for Californians, it’s higher costs and fewer choices.
