Hitler wrote that notorious story of his struggle during 13 months in prison, where he was sent for his role in the infamous beer-hall putsch of 1923. It\u2019s a period the journalist Peter Ross Range digs into in a new book, \u201c1924: The Year that Made Hitler.\u201d\n\nThe compressed time frame gives the book an enormous amount of scene-setting detail and an oddly intimate look at Hitler\u2019s experience of the world.\n\nSalon spoke to the author from his home in Washington, D.C.; the interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nYour premise is counter-intuitive: that the year Hitler spent in prison ended up as a great boon to him. Not just productive, but a turning point. Is that fair to say?\n\nExactly. Without that year, removed from the hurly-burly of politics, he might never have made the transition from impetuous revolutionary to patient political player for the long haul. And the long haul was what it took for him to come to power.\n\nHe became almost a celebrity when he was in prison, and his treason trial made him a hero to people on the fringe. How famous did he become?\n\nHe wasn\u2019t a big national hero, but he became nationally known. He became a hero to his following \u2013 it was an impassioned crowd to begin with. On the right, he was quickly seen as the standout figure among dozens of other competitors. What it did for him nationally was to put the brand out there through the German press. There were almost 60 reporters in the courtroom every day, so the story was all over Germany all the time, and it put his name out there and it did win converts \u2013 most notably a man in northwest Germany named Joseph Goebbels.\n\nWhat was his daily life in prison like? It\u2019s creepy to read that he was doing things like refereeing soccer games.\n\nThat\u2019s right \u2013 he was in prison with 40 other guys from the putsch \u2013 two or three of them were at his level but most of them were foot soldiers. And they needed exercise \u2013 they had the run of the garden of the prison for about four hours a day and were always looking for ways to get recreation and exercise. Soccer was one way; a boxing match was another.\n\nHitler refused to participate in any games because he was totally unathletic: His only sport was walking in the mountains. But partly because he stated flatly to one of his pals: \u201cIt won\u2019t do for a leader to seem to get beaten.\u201d\n\nSo he was already thinking of himself as someone who would rule the country.\n\nHe was already, before the putsch, comparing himself to people like Napoleon, and had this grand vision of himself as a messiah, the savior of Germany. The fantasies crystalized in prison and he came up with this theory that once in centuries you find a leader in whom is embodied the two qualities \u2013 one, the visionary and two, the practical politician\u2026. He wrote that in \u201cMein Kampf.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve written that \u201cMein Kampf\u201d was the equivalent of a campaign biography \u2013 how does it resemble what politicians turn out now?\n\nHe was building his legend. We think of campaign biographies as a fairly new phenomenon, designed to paint the would-be political leader in glowing terms, to make the life story look like either a conversion story \u2014 like Ben Carson in his book \u2014 or a hard-knocks, hard-up, up-from-the-bootstraps story like Abe Lincoln\u2019s.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Salon speaks to the author of \"1924: The Year that Made Hitler\" about the dictator's frightening transition", "title": "Hitler\u2019s turning point: Without his year in prison, \u201che could have disappeared into the sands of irrelevance\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Salon speaks to the author of \"1924: The Year that Made Hitler\" about the dictator's frightening transition", "title": "Hitler\u2019s turning point: Without his year in prison, \u201che could have disappeared into the sands of irrelevance\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/23/hitlers_turning_point_without_his_year_in_prison_he_could_have_disappeared_into_the_sands_of_irrelevance/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/adolf_hitler3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Salon speaks to the author of \"1924: The Year that Made Hitler\" about the dictator's frightening transition", "title": "Hitler\u2019s turning point: Without his year in prison, \u201che could have disappeared into the sands of irrelevance\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/adolf_hitler3.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Scott Timberg", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1924: The Year that Made Hitler, Adolf Hitler, Books, Editor's Picks, World War II", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Your premise is counter-intuitive: that the year Hitler spent in prison ended up as a great boon to him.\nHitler wrote that notorious story of his struggle during 13 months in prison, where he was sent for his role in the infamous beer-hall putsch of 1923.\nHe became almost a celebrity when he was in prison, and his treason trial made him a hero to people on the fringe.\nSalon spoke to the author from his home in Washington, D.C.; the interview has been lightly edited for clarity.\nHe wrote that in \u201cMein Kampf.\u201dYou\u2019ve written that \u201cMein Kampf\u201d was the equivalent of a campaign biography \u2013 how does it resemble what politicians turn out now?"}
