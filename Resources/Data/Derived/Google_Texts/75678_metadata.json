Researchers observed dozens of animal species and found regardless of the amount of fluid, it only takes 21 seconds for most mammals to urinate. They\u2019re hopeful it will shed light on the mechanics of the endocrine system, according to the new study, which was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nAt the Zoo Atlanta, located in Georgia, researchers videotaped dozens of mammals, from elephants, to cats, cows, and goats. It all started when mechanical engineer David Hu was changing his child\u2019s diaper and began to wonder how other mammals relieve themselves on a daily basis. \u201cI was thinking, \u2018How could anything be worse right now?\u2019\u201d Hu said. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Well, maybe if I was changing an elephant\u2019s diaper it would be really bad.\u2019\u201d\n\nAll animals that weigh more than 6.6 pounds will take 21 seconds to pee, give or take 13 seconds. Smaller animals, such as rats had bladders so small they couldn\u2019t hold a steady stream and instead produced \u201cgumballs\u201d of urine dispenses one by one. Humans and animals as small as cats produced enough urine to create a jet or stream. However, larger animals like elephants were able to fill up a kitchen garbage can with pee; all in the 21-second range. Collecting all of the urine itself in an accurate and measurable manner was no easy feat for researchers.\n\n\u201cWe ended up cutting sections of soda bottles, because it has to be something you can hold by hand, and just at a second\u2019s notice go on your hands and knees and hold it in the right position,\u201d Hu said. \u201cEverything else we tried failed. We tried pans \u2014 they don\u2019t like pans, they think it\u2019s weird. We tried pads \u2014 they don\u2019t like pads, they think it\u2019s weird.\u201d\n\nResearchers watched YouTube videos and reviewed scientific literature on the size of each species\u2019 bladder, along with the length and width of the urethra, which is the tube that allows urine to leave the body. An elephant\u2019s 18-liter bladder is nearly 3,600 times larger than a cat\u2019s bladder, but it doesn\u2019t take much longer than a cat to relieve itself.\n\nUrination duration has an important place for health, Hu explained. Life-threatening illnesses such as prostate cancer, or obesity can put pressure on the urethra. Also, knowing how long animals urinate will give a healthy basis and help alert a problem if the duration goes over the average seconds.\n\nSource: Hu DL, Choo J, Pham J, et al.
