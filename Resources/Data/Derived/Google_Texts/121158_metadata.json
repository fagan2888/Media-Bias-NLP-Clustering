We've got too much money invested in them.\"\n\n\n\nThe family said one dog was struck by lightning and died in the front yard before they could get her inside.\n\n\n\n\"My friend, if he would have gotten to her, it would have been 30 seconds, it would have been her,\" said Judy Bailey said.\n\nThe NWS said EF-0 don't typically cause an incredible amount of damage, and that people are generally safe if they can take shelter away from windows.\n\nCopyright 2014 by News4Jax.com.
