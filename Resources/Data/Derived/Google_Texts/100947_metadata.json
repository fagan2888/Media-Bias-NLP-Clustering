Those who prefer to do their own taxes, free online tax preparation is once again available. Go to myfreetaxes.com and you have access to assistance through a helpline provided by myfreetaxes.com in filing your return. A nominal fee may apply for household incomes of more than $60,000. This income limit is only associated with myfreetaxes.com.\n\nThis IRS-certified service is available thanks to a unique partnership of United Way of Hunterdon County and the IRS. The goals of this program are to provide savings on tax preparation fees as well as assist individuals and families in the claiming of tax credits such as the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC), and to encourage putting some of your tax refunds into savings accounts. By claiming these credits and splitting refunds, individuals and families have more money to pay bills, pay down debt and achieve or maintain financial stability. Last year, more than $1.25 million in refunds benefited local families and the local economy.\n\nUnited Way is working to advance the common good by focusing on income, health and education.
