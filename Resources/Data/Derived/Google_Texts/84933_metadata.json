Bryan Hughes of Mineola trounced fellow state Rep. David Simpson of Longview in the race for the Texas Senate District 1 seat.\n\nTotals have Hughes ahead, with 69.3 percent of the vote to Simpson\u2019s 30.7 percent, with all 175 precincts in the race reporting.\n\nBecause he has no Democratic opponent in November, Hughes will be sworn in to the seat being vacated by Sen. Kevin Eltife of Tyler.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just overwhelmed at the outpouring of support,\u201d he said Tuesday night. \u201cWe\u2019re humbled and very thankful for this support. It\u2019s a big responsibility and we\u2019re ready to get to work.\u201d\n\nHughes nearly won the March 1 primary outright, with 48 percent of the vote. His opponents, Simpson and James \u201cRed\u201d Brown, were virtually tied, at about 21.25 percent each. A fourth candidate, Mike Lee, was a distant also-ran with 9.5 percent.\n\nBrown didn\u2019t endorse either Hughes or Simpson in the runoff.\n\nHughes has been in the House since 2002. He clashed with House leadership from time to time - even running against Speaker Joe Straus in 2011.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked people to look at my record,\u201d he said during the campaign. I think it reflects the values of East Texas, and I\u2019ve built relationships in the region and in Austin to work for the district. I take principled stands without burning bridges and hurting relationships. It just makes sense that we have someone who can step in right away.\u201d\n\nYet in the Senate campaign, he\u2019s had the backing of Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a real blessing to have the Lieutenant Governor\u2019s support,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cHe\u2019s known as a conservative, and his values line up with East Texas, so his endorsement means a lot. \u201c\n\nHughes also got a late-in-the-game boost from Eltife, who held back from endorsing any candidate in the race, but donated $5,000 to Hughes late last week.\n\nContacted Tuesday night, Eltife said he was pleased with the outcome of the race.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited that Bryan has won, and I definitely think he will do a great job for Senate District 1,\u201d Eltife said. \u201cI think he\u2019s the right man for the job. I\u2019ve actually been working with him pretty closely ever since the session ended, and I\u2019ll keep doing that with issues that are important to our district. I want to do whatever I can to help him have a smooth start in the Senate.\u201d\n\nHughes said he will get to work in coming weeks, readying for the upcoming legislative session, which starts in January 2017.\n\n\u201cMy priorities will be what we\u2019ve been talking about all through the campaign, as we\u2019ve knocked on doors and talked to people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll focus on fighting the expansion of Obamacare, fighting to secure the border and fighting for religious freedom, as we see it coming under fire more and more.\u201d\n\nHughes said the recent Texas Supreme Court decision that ruled the state\u2019s school finance system isn\u2019t going to sway his determination to find a better way to fund public schools.\n\n\u201cLong before the Supreme Court ruled, we already knew that the current system isn\u2019t working,\u201d he said. \u201cMost of our students in Northeast Texas are not being treated fairly. The current system favors the fast-growing urban schools. So no matter what the Supreme Court said, we knew we had to fix the system. We need to make sure a child\u2019s ZIP code doesn\u2019t determine the level of funding she receives. And we\u2019ll be pushing for more local control and less mandated testing.\u201d\n\nSimpson, for his part, will be out of the House when the 85th Legislature convenes on Jan. 10.\n\nSimpson did not respond to the Tyler Paper on Tuesday evening. However, he told the Longview News-Journal, \u201cI am surprised he won by so much. I was hoping it would be close, at least. It wasn\u2019t even that. I have a little feeling for what Robert E. Lee felt when he went and surrendered to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @tmt_roy", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "TylerPaper.com", "description": "ROY MAYNARD, rmaynard@t...", "title": "Bryan Hughes wins Senate District 1 seat, defeating David Simpson - TylerPaper.com", "url": "http://www.tylerpaper.com/TP-Breaking+Silent/236353/bryan-hughes-wins-senate-district-1-seat-defeating-david-simpson", "image": "http://www.focusinon.me/photos/i-CbBrQxn/0/L/i-CbBrQxn-L.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tylerpaper"}, "fb": {"admins": "1651519031,627844030", "app_id": 210861005636155}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "ROY MAYNARD, rmaynard@tylerpaper.comState Rep.
