More than 150 guests filled the ballroom of Plymouth’s Crowne Plaza in support of Bloom Early Learning & Child Care, a nonprofit early learning center. Its 15th annual fundraiser, which was hosted by former WCCO chief meteorologist Mike Fairbourne, featured live music by World Beat Connection. Each table’s centerpiece included pictures of children who have benefited from Bloom programs. Proceeds from the child-focused evening will go to help single parents and families in need to find high-quality child care and early learning programs.
