A 2010 poll in Utah found that 62 percent of respondents \"definitely\" or \"probably\" agreed that illegal immigrants are responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime. A 2007 poll conducted on behalf of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice poll also reported that \u201c62 percent of people polled believed illegal immigration is tied to rising crime.\u201d The National Opinion Research Center\u2019s 2000 General Social Survey asked whether \u201cmore immigrants cause higher crime rates.\u201d Twenty-five percent of respondents said \u201cvery likely\u201d and an additional 48 percent answered \u201csomewhat likely.\u201d\n\nIn fact, most research today finds that immigrants, including undocumented ones, are less prone to crime than are native-born Americans. A 2008 study by researchers at the Public Policy Institute of California found that \u201cthe foreign-born, who make up about 35 percent of the adult population in California, constitute only about 17 percent of the adult prison population.\u201d They further noted, \u201cU.S.-born adult men are incarcerated at a rate over two-and-a-half times greater than that of foreign-born men.\u201d A 2010 report from the Berkeley Center for Criminal Justice observed that, between 1991 and 2008, when nearly 3.7 million foreign-born people, about a third of whom were \u201cunauthorized\u201d immigrants, moved to California, the state\u2019s violent crime rate fell by 55 percent. The national violent crime rate also has fallen by more than 70 percent since its peak in 1993 even as the number of immigrants residing here swelled from 20 to 40 million over the past two decades.\n\nIn fact, the findings in a 2010 study on immigrant populations in America\u2019s larger cities \u201csuggest that growth in immigration may have been responsible for part of the precipitous crime drop of the 1990s.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, there are a few studies that do find a correlation between immigration and higher property crime rates. Using county-level crime and immigrant data between 1980 and 2000, University of Chicago researcher Jorg Spenkuch calculates that \u201ca ten percent increase in the share of immigrants\u2014roughly one percentage point based on numbers from the 2000 Census\u2014is estimated to lead to an increase in the property crime rate of circa 1.2 percent, while the rate of violent crimes remains essentially unaffected.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Arizona started enforcing its Legal Arizona Workers Act (LAWA), which imposed sanctions on businesses that hired undocumented workers. As a consequence of LAWA, lots of young noncitizen male Mexican migrants left the state. Using data generated by this natural experiment for his 2013 study, University of Cincinnati criminal justice researcher, Aaron Chalfin finds, \u201cAfter 2008, Arizona's crime rate (particularly its property crime rate) declined by approximately 10 percent implying that the decline in the foreign-born Mexican share induced by LAWA resulted in a decline in property crimes of more than 20 percent.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s set aside the dispute over what the relationship between crime and immigration is for now to consider an interesting new study by team of researchers led by Saint Louis University sociologist Michael Vaughn. That study aims to get beyond the \u201cimmigrant paradox\u201d in which immigrants are more socially disadvantaged yet less likely to commit crime. They probe \u201cthe full depth of antisocial behavior\u201d using data from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Since there were two surveys, there is data on changes in antisocial behavior adjusting for the length of time immigrants had lived in the U.S.\n\nGood old-fashioned \u201croot causes\u201d sociology would suggest that since immigrants are more likely to be male, poor, younger, less educated and live in cities, they should be more prone to antisocial behavior. Yet this study reports that they are considerably less antisocial than native-born Americans. This finding applies to immigrants from Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America.\n\nThe NESARC asks participants to self-report on 31 antisocial behaviors including bullying, hurting animals, staying out late without permission, shoplifting, and starting fights.\n\n\u201cAcross the board, the prevalence of antisocial behavior among native-born Americans was greater than that of immigrants,\u201d find the researchers. According to the survey, immigrants were particularly less likely than native-borns to engage in behaviors that could hurt others, truancy, stay out late without permission, quit a job without options, shoplift, or do something for which they could get arrested. Native-borns were four times more likely to report violent behavior than Asian or African immigrants and three times more likely than Latin American immigrants. European immigrants were only about third less likely to engage in violence than native-borns.\n\nWhy might immigrants be more tractable? Fear of deportation would tend to make people behave, but it could also be that the sort of person who has the gumption to seek a better life in another country may already have the self-discipline to rein in antisocial behavior.\n\nIn any case, these findings prompt Vaughn and his colleagues to speculatively ask, \u201cIf increased immigration lowers the crime rate, then can immigration be thought of as a crime prevention strategy?\u201d\n\nWell, maybe, but the effect would only be temporary. Every year that an immigrant lives in the U.S. is associated with a 1.9 and 0.9 percent increase in nonviolent and violent crime respectively. Their data also show that the behaviors of the children of immigrants over time begins to resemble that of native-borns. In other words, assimilation means adopting the social (or antisocial) norms of native-born Americans.\n\nAn old joke goes: My family has been having problems with immigrants ever since we got to this country. Natives have always viewed newcomers with suspicion.\n\n\u201cThe continued indictment for criminality of those just arrived is as old as the history of our country, and has been directed, during each period, with greatest vehemence against that national group whose migration here has been the most recent and the most marked,\u201d observed a 1931 Michigan Law Review article. Citing the determinations of the congressional Dillingham Commission (1911) on immigration twenty years earlier, the article added, \u201cAll the evidence then available indicated a lesser criminality on the part of the immigrant group as a whole. Succeeding studies have supported this conclusion.\u201d\n\nThey still do.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Maybe they should be afraid of us.", "title": "Immigrants Are Less Criminal Than Native-Born Americans", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/07/11/immigrants-are-less-criminal-than-native", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14050823646589.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14050823646589.jpg", "title": "Immigrants Are Less Criminal Than Native-Born Americans", "description": "Immigration, especially illegal immigration,\nleads to more crime, assert some anti-immigrant think tanks.
