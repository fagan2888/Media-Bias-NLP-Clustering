And about 25 percent report that they\u2019re concerned someone in their immediate family will catch it. Those beliefs are likely fueled by the fact that two thirds of the people surveyed said they believe Ebola can be \u201ceasily\u201d transmitted from infected people.\n\nIn reality, however, Ebola is not that easy to catch. While it is a communicable disease, it can only be spread through a sick person\u2019s bodily fluids or by eating an infected animal. So unlike the flu, for instance, you can\u2019t get Ebola by standing next to someone who coughs, sneezes, or breathes on you. For that reason, it\u2019s relatively easy to contain; although it\u2019s spreading rapidly in impoverished West African nations that lack adequate health care infrastructures to respond to the outbreak, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) say there\u2019s virtually no chance it could spread very far in the United States.\n\nSo why have Americans been left with such an inaccurate impression of how much they should worry about Ebola?\n\nIt\u2019s likely partly because the outbreak, which is truly devastating for the people living in countries like Liberia and Sierra Leone, makes for such a dramatic story. The idea that there\u2019s an unstoppable virus threatening to ravage countries across the world plays into our pop culture fascination with pandemics. Virus disaster movies like 1995\u2019s Outbreak and 2011\u2019s Contagion may help further Americans\u2019 fears about Ebola as an immediate and personal threat, even though it\u2019s actually a health emergency specific to West Africa.\n\nPlus, the media continues to cover Ebola with ominous headlines \u2014 \u201cU.S. can\u2019t seal borders to stop Ebola,\u201d Politico reported at the beginning of this month, while Business Insider declared that \u201cEbola\u2019s spread to the U.S. is inevitable\u201d \u2014 that overshadow the facts about why Americans don\u2019t actually need to panic. According to experts, even if news stories include the proper context about why Ebola isn\u2019t expected to spread here in the U.S., readers won\u2019t necessary focus on that part.\n\n\u201cEven though your stories may have included the fact that you have to have open sore or direct bodily contact to catch it, that is not the headline to most people here. We have lazy brains. We don\u2019t want to think about things in a lot of detail,\u201d David Ropeik, a risk perception consultant based in Massachusetts, told NBC News. \u201cWe just don\u2019t do all the homework. We never do.\u201d\n\nWhen a story like Ebola is dominating the headlines, it can be easy for people to jump to conclusions without having all of the information. Last week, several media outlets started reporting on a link between climate change and Ebola, even though scientists say the evidence supporting that claim is \u201cvery weak.\u201d And Donald Trump, infamous for promoting the myth that vaccines cause autism, expressed unfounded panic about Ebola spreading in the U.S. after two Americans infected abroad were flown to Atlanta to receive treatment.\n\nThe lead researcher who conducted the Harvard survey, Gillian SteelFisher, concluded that public figures have a responsibility to try to communicate even more clearly about the realities of Ebola. \u201cAs they report on events related to Ebola, the media and public health officials need to better inform Americans of Ebola and how it is spread,\u201d SteelFisher said in a statement released along with her poll results.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A quarter of Americans think the virus might infect them or one of their family members in the next year.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A quarter of Americans think the virus might infect them or one of their family members in the next year.", "title": "Americans Believe Ebola Poses A Much Bigger Threat To Them Than It Actually Does", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/08/26/3475698/americans-ebola-myths/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AP98394313848.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A quarter of Americans think the virus might infect them or one of their family members in the next year.", "title": "Americans Believe Ebola Poses A Much Bigger Threat To Them Than It Actually Does", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AP98394313848-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AP98394313848.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/AP98394313848.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-26T10:36:14+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd80ea\"", "article_summary": "According to a new poll conducted by Harvard researchers, about 40 percent of Americans are anticipating an Ebola outbreak on U.S. soil within the next 12 months.\nSo why have Americans been left with such an inaccurate impression of how much they should worry about Ebola?\nThose beliefs are likely fueled by the fact that two thirds of the people surveyed said they believe Ebola can be \u201ceasily\u201d transmitted from infected people.\nVirus disaster movies like 1995\u2019s Outbreak and 2011\u2019s Contagion may help further Americans\u2019 fears about Ebola as an immediate and personal threat, even though it\u2019s actually a health emergency specific to West Africa.\nSo unlike the flu, for instance, you can\u2019t get Ebola by standing next to someone who coughs, sneezes, or breathes on you."}
