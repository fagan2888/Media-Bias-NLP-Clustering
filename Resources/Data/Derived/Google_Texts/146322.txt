The Detroit Federation of Teachers says reports that Detroit Public Schools teachers plan to strike or hold sickouts this week are not true.

The union held a news conference Monday to spotlight the actions it says it is taking to influence legislators as they debate the future of DPS. Union administrator Ann Mitchell says strike actions are currently not among them.

She says the small group of vocal dissenters calling for strike actions have very little support among union membership.

Mitchell says, “That’s why the sickout today was not a sick out. That’s why all the schools were open. That’s why people are saying we have a program. We have to fight to keep our schools. We have to fight to have a future for our schools.”

Mitchell says strike rumors are very disruptive to the union’s work and message. She says the DFT is reaching out to lawmakers and community members via phone banks and street campaigns.
