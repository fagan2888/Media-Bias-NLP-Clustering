Florent Groberg, 32, with the country\u2019s highest military distinction.\n\nThe president\u2019s remark wasn\u2019t the result of a sneaky speechwriter or a teleprompter on the fritz, but rather a reference to a meeting Capt. Groberg had with the band\u2019s actual singer, Jonathan Davis, while recovering in the hospital from wartime injuries.\n\nCapt. Groberg was serving in Afghanistan in August 2012 when he spotted a suicide bomber and tackled him, saving the lives of several other soldiers but not without sustaining injuries that required him to undergo 33 surgeries on his leg alone.\n\nThe Korn singer visited the vet while he was recuperating, but the ailing soldier assumed he was imagining their encounter.\n\n\u201cFlo thought, \u2018What\u2019s going on? Am I hallucinating?\u2019\u201d Mr. Obama recalled during Thursday\u2019s ceremony, \u201cToday Flo, I want to assure you you are not hallucinating. You are actually in the White House. Those cameras are on, and I am not the lead singer from Korn.\u201d\n\nAs Rolling Stone was quick to point out, Mr. Davis has shared some choice words about the commander-in-chief in the past, telling an interviewer in 2014 that Mr. Obama was \u201can Illuminati puppet\u201d who had \u201cdragged the country down to the worst it\u2019s ever been.\u201d\n\nResponding to the president\u2019s decision to share the bedside anecdote this week, the singer of Korn, whose hits included \u201cFreak on a Leash\u201d and \u201cGot the Life,\u201d shared an excerpt from the speech on Instagram, which he bluntly captioned: \u201cWow.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama assured the latest recipient of the prestigious Medal of Honor during a reception Thursday at the White House: \"I am not the lead singer from Korn.\"", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "President Obama assured the latest recipient of the prestigious Medal of Honor during a reception Thursday at the White House: \u201cI am not the lead singer from Korn.\u201d", "title": "Obama to Medal of Honor recipient: \u2018I am not the lead singer from Korn\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/13/obama-to-medal-of-honor-recipient-i-am-not-the-lea/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/09/Immigration.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/11/09/Immigration.jpg", "description": "President Obama assured the latest recipient of the prestigious Medal of Honor during a reception Thursday at the White House: \"I am not the lead singer from Korn.\"", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama to Medal of Honor recipient: \u2018I am not the lead singer fro"}, "Author": "Andrew Blake", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Human Interest, Entertainment Culture, White House"}, "article_summary": "The Korn singer visited the vet while he was recuperating, but the ailing soldier assumed he was imagining their encounter.\nAm I hallucinating?\u2019\u201d Mr. Obama recalled during Thursday\u2019s ceremony, \u201cToday Flo, I want to assure you you are not hallucinating.\nPresident Obama assured the latest recipient of the prestigious Medal of Honor during a reception Thursday at the White House: \u201cI am not the lead singer from Korn.\u201dMr. Obama referred to the 1990s metal band in his speech before awarding Army Capt.\nGroberg had with the band\u2019s actual singer, Jonathan Davis, while recovering in the hospital from wartime injuries.\nThe president\u2019s remark wasn\u2019t the result of a sneaky speechwriter or a teleprompter on the fritz, but rather a reference to a meeting Capt."}
