Chancellor Angela Merkel is confident Germany will win the World Cup final against Argentina.

Merkel told German public Television ZDF on Saturday, "It certainly won't be easy tomorrow; after the 7:1 everybody thinks 'It's almost done' â€” that's why we all need to cross our fingers again."

Germany, fresh from its 7-1 semifinal win over host Brazil, will play an Argentina team led by Lionel Messi at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday. The chancellor and German President Joachim Gauck will travel to Brazil hoping to watch the team win the trophy.

Merkel did not want to predict the final score, but said the most important thing is simply that Germany wins.

However, she warned, "Every final, is a difficult final."
