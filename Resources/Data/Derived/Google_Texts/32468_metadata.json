To remedy the problems faced by small business, she will:\n\nCut Regulatory Red Tape\n\nIf elected, Clinton plans to launch a nationwide effort to cut red tape for small businesses at every level of government. Further, she will build a roadmap to help small businesses navigate the regulatory landscape and reduce compliance costs associated with federal, state and local regulation.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take longer to start a small business in the United States than it does in Canada, France, or South Korea,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nIn an April 2015 Washington Post article, Clinton cited a World Bank survey ranking the United States 46th in the world in the difficulty of starting a small business.\n\n\u201cWe have to be number one again,\u201d she said. \u201cFor so many decades it was taken for granted that we would be \u2014 and we were \u2014 but slowly over time, it\u2019s become more difficult, more expensive, more red tape, unnecessary regulation that has really put a damper on economic growth.\u201d\n\nExpand Access to Capital\n\nClinton plans to give small businesses access to the financing needed to support growth. In particular, she is focused on women- and minority-owned businesses.\n\n\u201cSmall business owners need access to financing and credit to build, grow, expand and hire,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cLending has recovered since the crisis, but it\u2019s still hard for new firms to get credit.\u201d\n\nShe also plans to remove unnecessary regulatory burdens on community banks, which provide credit to small business owners and families looking to invest in their futures.\n\nProvide Tax Relief\n\nClinton says she will simplify tax filing and provide targeted tax relief for small businesses.\n\n\u201cThe smallest businesses, with one to five employees, spend 150 hours and $1,100 per employee on federal tax compliance,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThat\u2019s more than 20 times higher than the average for far larger firms. We\u2019ve got to fix that.\u201d\n\nExpand Access to New Markets\n\nAccording to the small business position statement, Clinton will invest in the infrastructure \u2014 roads, bridges, ports and airports \u2014 needed to make it easier for small businesses to reach new customers. Also, she will defend the Export-Import Bank, a crucial financing partner for small businesses, and will encourage innovation through the development of technology platforms that enable small businesses to sell anywhere \u2014 in America and throughout the world.\n\n\u201cAmerican small business should be able to tap new markets \u2014 whether they are across their city, across their state or around the world,\u201d she said.\n\nSupport Small Business Owners and Entrepreneurs\n\nClinton will work to provide incubators, mentoring and training to 50,000 entrepreneurs and small-business owners in underserved communities across the country and seek to improve entrepreneurial literacy among high school students as well.\n\n\u201cThese programs will help those with good ideas today become the entrepreneurs and business leaders of tomorrow,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton\u2019s Position on Other Small Business Issues\n\nBut Clinton also appears willing to defend and support the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) \u2014 otherwise known as Obamacare \u2014 when and if she becomes president. The act has been unpopular with many small business owners.\n\n\u201cI am committed to trying to build on what works in the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Clinton said in the Washington Post article, adding that, \u201cWe have to do a better job of creating a more competitive marketplace.\u201d\n\nIn the health care position statement on her website, Clinton said that she will \u201cbuild on Obamacare to expand affordable coverage, slow the growth of overall health care costs (including prescription drugs) and make it possible for providers to deliver the very best care to patients.\u201d\n\nLabor Unions\n\nClinton also strongly supports labor unions, stating on her website that she plans to strengthen the unions and protect work bargaining power. This is another place her campaign may find itself at odds with some small business owners.\n\n\u201cIf we want to get serious about raising incomes, we have to get serious about supporting union workers,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nPaid Leave\n\nClinton also supports the concept of a national paid leave plan for parents.\n\n\u201cWe are the last developed country in the world that has no national paid leave for parenting or illness,\u201d Clinton said in an NBC News report.\n\n\u201cFor many workers, staying home to take care of a sick child or an aging parent means losing a paycheck \u2014 or worse, even losing a job,\u201d she said in a position statement on paid leave on her website. \u201cThat is an impossible choice we shouldn\u2019t ask anyone to make \u2014 and yet American workers are forced to make it every day.\u201d\n\nIt will remain to be seen where support for such a plan will come from and who will be footing the bill to determine how such regulation might affect small businesses. But one thing is certain. Small businesses with only a handful of employees will be seriously impacted if forced to grant paid leave t employees who they are unable to replace.\n\nImmigration Reform\n\nClinton has called for comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n\u201cWe are turning down people who really want to work,\u201d she said in the Washington Post article.\n\nNoting that all of her grandparents immigrated to the United States, Clinton said, \u201cI sit here and I think you\u2019re talking about the second and third generation \u2014 that\u2019s me, that\u2019s you. We are saying to all these other people who want the same dreams and the same aspirations, and the willingness to work hard just like our families did, no, we\u2019re not going to make it easy for you, we\u2019re not going make it legal for you.\u201d\n\nIn a position statement on her website, Clinton classified immigration reform primarily as a family issue rather than an economic one.\n\n\u201cWe have to finally and once and for all fix our immigration system \u2014 this is a family issue,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt\u2019s an economic issue too, but it is at heart a family issue. If we claim we are for family, then we have to pull together and resolve the outstanding issues around our broken immigration system.\n\n\u201cThe American people support comprehensive immigration reform not just because it\u2019s the right thing to do \u2014 and it is \u2014 but because it will strengthen families, strengthen our economy and strengthen our country. That\u2019s why we can\u2019t wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship.\u201d\n\nConclusion\n\nIn some of her positions on small business \u2014 lower tax rates, greater access to capital and removal of oppressive government regulations \u2014 Clinton almost sounds like a Republican. In others \u2014 her support of Obamacare and labor unions, for example \u2014 she appears to stand in opposition to small business interests.\n\nRegardless of where she stands on any given issue, growing up in a family-run small business has certainly influenced Clinton\u2019s beliefs.\n\n\u201cThe early lessons I learned about hard work and entrepreneurship have stuck with me all my life \u2014 a sentence my father would be thrilled to read,\u201d she said in a blog post on business social network LinkedIn.\n\nAnd even though small businesses favor Trump by a vast majority, Clinton feels strongly that she is the candidate to best represent them.\n\n\u201cSmall businesses all over the country are ready to grow and hire, and entrepreneurs are ready to venture out on their own \u2014 if they can just get that next loan, enter a new market or have one fewer form to fill out,\u201d she said. \u201cHillary Clinton will be the small business president.\u201d\n\nFor more information on Hillary Clinton on small business and her proposed policies regarding small business, visit the following:\n\nFact Sheet on Small Business Issues (Clinton campaign; includes Clinton\u2019s voting record)\n\nHillary Clinton: A Small Business Snapshot on the Issues (Small Business Executive Council)", "article_metadata": {"description": "Where is presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on small business issues?
