While many people have spent the past several years slugging it out in the courts over Obamacare, the President himself has managed to make fitness and health a priority, famously making time to get in workouts and engage in one of his favorite athletic activities: golf.\n\nWhether you love him or hate him for it, Obama has made his mark on the nation\u2019s health. And when it comes to his own personal health and fitness? Obama is hitting it out of the park \u2014 despite having what is probably the most stressful job in human history.\n\nThe White House recently released a physician\u2019s report from Obama\u2019s most recent health checkup in February, and though you\u2019d think being the President would\u2019ve taken its toll on him after eight years in office, it turns out he\u2019s doing remarkably well. \u201cThe President\u2019s overall health remains excellent and is improved from his last formal assessment,\u201d wrote Obama\u2019s doctor, Ronny L. Jackson.\n\n\u201cThe President\u2019s overall health remains excellent and is improved from his last formal assessment,\u201d wrote Obama\u2019s doctor, Ronny L. Jackson. \u201cHis adherence to a healthy diet and a consistent exercise program has resulted in an improved lean body mass and lower cholesterol level.\u201d\n\nHow did has he managed to do it? According to Jackson, \u201cthe President continues to focus on healthy lifestyle choices. He eats a healthy diet, remains tobacco free, and only drinks alcohol occasionally and in moderation. He continues to exercise daily with a focus on aerobic fitness and resistance weight training.\u201d\n\nNow, it\u2019s easy to imagine that the President is benefitting from a team of personal chefs and dietitians while living at The White House, so he does have an advantage when it comes to maintaining a healthy diet over us commoners. He\u2019s also able to get his workouts in right at home (when he\u2019s there) by utilizing the White House\u2019s gym. Not to mention basketball and tennis courts, in addition to personal trainers.\n\nAt age 54, Obama is still physically holding up; that can\u2019t be denied. Though the stresses of the job have taken a toll on him \u2014 just take a look at some photos of him prior to taking office, contrasted with today \u2014 he likely has many years ahead. If there is one area of his life that has suffered, you\u2019d have to imagine it\u2019s been his sleep schedule. He reportedly gets only five or six hours per night, assuming there are no national crises to attend to. That\u2019s not nearly enough, as we\u2019ve been told by sleep experts.\n\nBut what about his other vitals? How does he stack up to the average 54-year-old American male?\n\nObama\u2019s blood pressure\n\nYou\u2019d have to imagine the President\u2019s blood pressure readings would crack the gauge, but Obama actually has surprisingly low numbers. Obama\u2019s blood pressure, per the official report, comes in at 110/68 \u2014 a very healthy level given his age and circumstances. Given that roughly one out of every three American adults has high blood pressure, (54% for Obama\u2019s age group) you\u2019d expect Obama to be among them. But a proper diet and exercise helped him keep it under control.\n\nIdeally, your blood pressure readings should be 120 over 80.\n\nObama\u2019s cholesterol levels\n\nHis doctor\u2019s report says that Obama has managed to keep his cholesterol level under control, giving him scores for his total cholesterol of 188, HDL (good) cholesterol 68, and LDL (bad) of 125. How does that stack up to everyone else? Well, recommended levels for LDL are under 100 \u2014 so, the President has some work to do on that front. HDL levels are recommended to be between 40 and 60. Again, not ideal, but the President\u2019s in the ballpark. Total cholesterol should be below 200.\n\nOn average, Americans\u2019 total cholesterol is 196, and has been declining in recent years.\n\nPresidential BMI\n\nObama is 6\u20191\u2033 tall and weighs 175 pounds. If we plug those into a BMI calculator, he comes in at a BMI number of 23.1. That lands him in the \u201cnormal weight\u201d category \u2014 so, he\u2019s not over underweight. That puts him in a much better position than the average American man, however. That number is 26.6, well within the confines of the \u201coverweight\u201d category. In terms of body mass, Obama is beating the average.\n\nAgain, private gyms, personal trainers, and personal chefs help in this regard. But the President has shown that by making fitness and health a priority, anyone can maintain a healthy lifestyle. Even if you\u2019re lacking sleep, and working an incredibly stressful job.\n\nFollow Sam on Facebook and Twitter @Sliceofginger\n\nMore from Health & Fitness Cheat Sheet:", "article_metadata": {"syndication-source": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/obama-care-healthy-president-obama.html/", "sailthru.date": "2016-05-25 05:30:00", "sailthru.author": "samuel-becker", "news_keywords": "Barack Obama,healthy living,wellness,", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Cheat Sheet", "description": "The White House recently released a doctor's report on President Obama's health.
