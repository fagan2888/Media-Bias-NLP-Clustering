Second-ranked Lydia Ko, No. 3 Stacy Lewis and 2014 winner Shanshan Feng tied for second.\n\n\u201cI was weirdly calm today,\u201d Korda said. \u201cI knew what I needed to do. I needed to take care of myself. If somebody was going to make a hot start, that\u2019s just the way it was going to be. I was going to continue playing my game.\u201d\n\nShe cried on the 18th green after her final putt.\n\n\u201cI think just struggling and being at your lowest and then feeling this and just going through these emotions, just incredible gratitude and just being so humbled by everything,\u201d Korda said. \u201cAll the support that I\u2019ve had, the people that have stuck with me this year, didn\u2019t stop believing in me even when I did a little bit. I think just all that hit me a little bit.\u201d\n\nThe long-hitter failed to qualify for the Solheim Cup team and was passed over as a captain\u2019s pick.\n\n\u201cStepping back and looking at it, yeah, I was disappointed I wasn\u2019t on the team, but I know I played my way off the team and there was no chance that I could have helped,\u201d Korda said. \u201cI was really glad with the way that everything happened. I got to go to the Czech Republic for a couple days after Evian and sit down with my grandparents and my cousin. Honestly, the last three weeks have been such a great time in my life.\u201d\n\nKorda finished at 18-under 266 and earned $300,000. She opened with rounds of 69, 67 and 65 to take a two-stroke lead into the final day. The weekend 65s are her two best scores this year.\n\n\u201cJess played unbelievable today. Nobody was going to beat her,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cWhen you have a two-shot lead and shoot 6 under, it\u2019s pretty hard to beat.\u201d\n\nKorda\u2019s father, Petr, won the 1998 Australian Open tennis tournament.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t actually get to talk to my dad,\u201d Korda said. \u201cIt went straight to voicemail, but I did get a series of text messages.\u201d\n\nKo finished with a 66. The 18-year-old New Zealander was coming off consecutive victories in Canada and France, where she became the youngest major champion.\n\nFeng also had a 66, and Lewis shot 67.\n\n\u201cI think I did a lot of good stuff this week and a lot of good things to build on,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nThe event was the first of five straight in Asia.
