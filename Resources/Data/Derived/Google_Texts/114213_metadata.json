Bobby Jindal delivers the keynote address during Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s Road to Majority event in Washington. (Molly Riley/AP)\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has never been one to hide his education bonafides.\n\nThe wonkish former Rhodes Scholar has established himself as a leader in accountability-based education reform, and enthusiastically supported the Common Core standards (which establish the skills students should master at each grade level in English and math).\n\nUntil he didn\u2019t. At a gathering of tea party activists last August, Jindal vowed to fight any efforts to impose a \u201cnational curriculum\u201d (never mind the fact that the Common Core was created and implemented by states). It was the first step in what would become a slow but spectacular reversal. In less than a year, Jindal went from one of the Common Core\u2019s biggest allies to one of its most trenchant opponents, writing \u201ccentralized planning didn\u2019t work in Russia, it\u2019s not working with our health care system and it won\u2019t work in education.\u201d\n\nBy June, Jindal tried to pull Louisiana out of the Common Core completely, ordering his staff to invalidate the contract to pay PARCC, a multi-state testing consortium. That set off chaos in schools and a high-stakes showdown with the quasi-independent, still pro-Common Core state education board; the whole matter is likely headed to court.\n\nThis is just the most ostentatious example of nationally ambitious Republicans turning away from the education standards their party helped create.\n\nHere\u2019s how it happened: Concerned that American students were falling behind their foreign peers, the National Governors Association (under the leadership of Georgia Republican Sonny Perdue, Delaware Democrat Jack Markell and the Council of Chief State School Officers) set out in 2009 to create grade-by-grade, measurable benchmarks.\n\nThat effort was hailed by everyone from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Urban League, to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. President Obama jumped on board too; while the administration didn\u2019t mandate anything, it offered financial incentives to jurisdictions that adopted rigorous standards.\n\nUltimately, that was the kiss of death. Obama\u2019s backing became a red flag to conservative activists, who saw parallels to the hated Affordable Care Act (eventually, they dubbed it \u201cObamaCore,\u201d or, alternatively, \u201cCommie Core.\u201d)\n\nElections in the intervening years replaced some of original backers with governors who proved far more skeptical, or at least more loyal to the GOP\u2019s vocal tea party wing that, in many cases, had propelled them to office. These days, Jindal\u2019s peers aren\u2019t people like Indiana\u2019s Mitch Daniels, another original Common Core advocate, but his successor Mike Pence, who has signed legislation pulling his state out.\n\nOther GOP governors with larger aspirations are fleeing too, including South Carolina\u2019s Nikki Haley, who also signed anti-Common Core legislation, and Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker, who\u2019s distanced himself but has not made a clean break. Texas Gov. Rick Perry got in on the opposition early; he was one of the only governors who didn\u2019t sign on in the first place, and has said that \u201cthe academic standards of Texas are not for sale.\u201d\n\nOther Republican presidential hopefuls, like Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.), Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, are tripping over themselves to decry the standards. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, one of the biggest names in tea party politics, has taken to declaring that \u201cwe already have a common core. It\u2019s called the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nThere are outliers though. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has decried the critics as knee-jerk opponents of Obama writ large. Jeb Bush, whose tenure as Florida governor predated Common Core, has long been a missionary for the cause \u2014 and he\u2019s showing no sign of wavering in the face of the uprising. Bush\u2019s private foundation continues to spend millions promoting Common Core, and he told Fox News this spring: \u201cI just don\u2019t feel compelled to run for cover when I think this is the right thing to do for our country.\u201d\n\nWhat can we learn from the holdouts? Unlike most of their potential primary rivals, Christie and Bush hail from the branch of the GOP that doesn\u2019t see federal government as a bogeyman, and doesn\u2019t necessarily equate compromise with surrender. They also happen to come from states that Obama won twice, so they understand that not everyone demands or even cares for small-government orthodoxy. A recent poll by NBC and the Wall Street Journal suggests Common Core isn\u2019t so toxic \u2014 although 53 percent of \u201cTea Party Republicans\u201d oppose it, the country at large is 59 percent in favor.\n\nThat suggests a pro-Common Core candidate could do just fine come 2016 \u2014 or at least swing the debate back to more substantive questions over how the new standards are playing out in classrooms across the country, and what American education policy should be. Provided that candidate can make it through the GOP primary gauntlet first.\n\nThis story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news outlet at Teachers College, Columbia University.
