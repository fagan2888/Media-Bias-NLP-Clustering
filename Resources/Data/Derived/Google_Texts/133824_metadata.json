By a vote of 9-33, state senators rejected HB 3101, the Freedom of Health Care Protection Act. As the record shows, debate on the bill in its original form was interrupted repeatedly by the introduction of hundreds of amendments.\n\nOne such amendment was proposed by the bill\u2019s primary sponsor, Tom Davis. Davis\u2019s proposal would have relieved businesses of the purported \u201cquandary\u201d of choosing between obedience to state law or federal law. The Morning News Online reports on the legislative wrangling that accompanied Davis\u2019s effort:\n\nUnder Senate Rule No. 24, any amendment attached to a bill must have related language or be germane to the bill. President Glenn McConnell ruled that the amendment was not germane.\n\nSen. Davis attempted to override McConnell\u2019s ruling, but the attempt failed by a vote of 18 to 24. The Senate invoked cloture, which is rare. Cloture is a procedure by which the Senate can vote to place a time limit on consideration of a bill or other matter, and thereby cause an immediate vote to be taken on the bill.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, Davis\u2019 proposed amendment \u201csets regulations for navigators who help people sign up for health insurance through the federal website. It also requires state agencies to hold hearings before applying for federal grants tied to the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nEarlier on in the deliberations, Davis reportedly said that \u201che wants to narrow the proposed ban on state agencies aiding Obamacare to exempt those required to carry out parts of the law.\u201d Another story quoted Davis as saying that he \u201caccepts the federal government's ability to enact the law.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s hardly the bold blueprint for state nullification of an unconstitutional federal act, as anticipated by our Founding Fathers.\n\nJames Madison, for example, in The Federalist, No. 45, recommended that state lawmakers \u201crefuse to cooperate with officers of the Union\u201d when the federal authority attempted to enforce any act not falling within its constitutionally enumerated powers.\n\nWhile Davis\u2019 language as reported by MyrtleBeachOnline.com is not as forceful as the Founders would prefer, in another interview he pointed to a solid Supreme Court case that supports his position of a state\u2019s right to refuse to carry the federal government\u2019s water.\n\nDavis named his failed amendment the \u201cAnti-Commandeering Amendment.\u201d In MedCityNews, Davis\u2019s reliance on the anti-commandeering principle was first reported:\n\nAccording to Davis, his \"anti-commandeering\" measure is based on a 1997 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that says the federal government cannot force states to use their resources to carry out laws approved by Congress.\n\nAs we have reported on many occasions, the concept of anti-commandeering prohibits the federal government from forcing states to participate in any federal program that does not concern \u201cinternational and interstate matters.\u201d\n\nWhile this expression of federalism (\u201cdual sovereignty,\u201d as it was named by Justice Antonin Scalia) was first set forth in the case of New York v. United States (1992), most recently it was reaffirmed by the high court in the case of Mack and Printz v. United States (1997).\n\nAnti-commandeering, as set forth in the Supreme Court decision in Mack and Printz v. United States, prohibits the federal government from forcing states to participate in any federal program that does not concern \u201cinternational and interstate matters.\u201d\n\nWriting for the majority, Scalia explained:\n\nThe Constitution thus contemplates that a State's government will represent and remain accountable to its own citizens. As Madison expressed it: \"[T]he local or municipal authorities form distinct and independent portions of the supremacy, no more subject, within their respective spheres, to the general authority than the general authority is subject to them, within its own sphere.\" The Federalist No. 39, at 245. [Citations removed.]\n\nAccording to Davis, then, the House bill he helped re-write for the State Senate relies, at least in part, on the decision handed down in the Mack/Printz case.\n\nApparently, though, despite taking a stance against Palmetto State enforcement of ObamaCare, Davis does not see his bill as an example of nullification. In fact, he seems not to accept nullification as a valid weapon in the arsenal of liberty.\n\nA report out of South Carolina published earlier this year contains a disturbing statement made by Davis. In a statement published in January on a Tea Party website, Davis reportedly said nullification was not \"an available remedy\" and then went on to misinterpret Article VI's so-called Supremacy Clause and perpetuate the myth of unquestionable judicial authority.\n\nIsland Packet quotes Davis\u2019s denial of a state\u2019s power to nullify ObamaCare: \u201cThe conversation really has gotten off the rails a little bit,\u201d Davis said Wednesday, after holding three public hearings across the state that drew hundreds. \u201cEverybody talks about nullification. This isn\u2019t nullification. We can\u2019t nullify.\u201d\n\nBut state legislators not only can nullify every unconstitutional act of the federal government, they must do so if they are to faithfully adhere to the oath they swear as mandated by Article VI. What\u2019s more, the Founders of our Republic would expect state lawmakers to stand for state sovereignty.\n\nAs James Madison wrote in the Virginia Resolution of 1798:\n\nIn case of a deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers, not granted by the said compact, the states who are parties thereto, have the right, and are in duty bound, to interpose for arresting the progress of the evil, and for maintaining within their respective limits, the authorities, rights and liberties appertaining to them.\n\nPut simply: State legislators are bound by an oath and by fidelity to the Constitution to nullify every unconstitutional act of the federal government, every time, without exception.\n\nDavis believes, though, that the South Carolina legislature\u2019s only option is to delay enforcement of ObamaCare \u201cas best they can until such time as Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nThis tack is moot, now, though, as the bill failed to pass out of the State Senate.\n\nPerhaps it is the failure of the legislation\u2019s own advocates to boldly embrace the nullification of ObamaCare that led to the confusion as to the bill\u2019s purpose; confusion that ultimately led to its defeat.\n\nConcerned citizens aren\u2019t confused, though, and they refuse to wait on Washington to fix a problem Washington caused. Instead, they realize they need to forcibly derail the \u201clong train of abuses and usurpations\u201d and \u201cprovide new Guards for their future security\u201d \u2014 the states and themselves.\n\nSenator Davis\u2019 opinion to the contrary, nullification is still the \u201crightful remedy.\u201d\n\nActs not authorized under the enumerated powers of the Constitution are \u201cmerely acts of usurpation\u201d and deserve to be disregarded, ignored, and denied any legal effect.\n\nMore state legislators need to learn this. Familiarity with these facts is critical to reclaiming state authority and destroying the threat to liberty posed by the centralization of power in Washington, D.C.\n\nAs for Davis, his seemingly self-fulfilling prophecy that \u201cAt the end of the day, the ACA will still be the law of the land in South Carolina,\u201d has come true, due in no small measure to his own failure to embrace nullification and unapologetically assert the authority of states to act in all but a few enumerated areas, as protected by the Tenth Amendment.\n\nPerhaps in the next legislative session there can be found in the Palmetto State a lawmaker committed to the Constitution and to forcing the federal beast back inside its constitutional cage.\n\nJoe A.
