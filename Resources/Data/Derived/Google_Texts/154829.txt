While Saturday, March 15 was a normal weekend day, much like any other, for the vast majority of the world, for a select few defenders of white men and the white race in general, it was a day of political action.

Organized by a white guy from Massachusetts named Kyle Hunt, the White Man March, as it was called, was intended to be a worldwide, semi-coordinated effort of oppressed white men to demand their rights and fight back against “diversity,” which, in their telling, is a codeword for “white genocide.”

Unfortunately for embattled white guys everywhere, the event seems to have been something of a flop, with very few attendees and precious little non-mocking coverage from the media. But that’s not to say the whole thing was for naught; on Twitter, it led to the explosion of a mocking hashtag, #whitemanmarchprotestsigns, which provided countless numbers of bored weekend tweeters with something funny to do on an otherwise uneventful Saturday.

Here, then, are some of the better #whitemanmarchprotestsigns tweets:
