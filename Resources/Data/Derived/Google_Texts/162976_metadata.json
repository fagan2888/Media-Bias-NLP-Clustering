But for 2013\u2013the last year for which statistics are available\u2013the death rates for that sector increased by half a percent for the first time.\n\nThe rates, Deaton said, caused the pair to start \u201cfalling off our chairs because of what we found.\u201d\n\nNPR reported that the \u201cmortality rate among whites ages 45 to 54 had increased by a half-percent a year from 381.5 per 100,000 in 1999 to 415.4 in 2013.\u201d\n\nDeaton and Case calculated that during this uptick in deaths, 488,500 Americans had died that wouldn\u2019t have if the 2 percent downward trend had continued.\n\nThe researchers also found that this downward trend is not being repeated in similar groups in other countries. Only whites in the U.S. are dying at an increased rate.\n\nIt also seems that the deaths are increasing for those with lower levels of education.\n\n\u201cThose are the people who have really been hammered by the long-term economic malaise,\u201d Deaton says in his report. \u201cTheir wages in real terms have been going down. So they get into middle age having their expectations just not met at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne possible explanation is that for whites, their parents had done better economically and they had been doing pretty well. Then all of a sudden the financial floor dropped out from underneath them,\u201d says Jon Skinner, a professor of economic and medicine at Dartmouth College, adds in the study. \u201cFor African-American and Hispanic households things had never been that optimistic and so perhaps the shock wasn\u2019t quite as great.\u201d\n\nAs to the stagnant job market that researchers feel might be at least one reason for the rising death rates, recent reports show that Americans who have simply given up looking for work are at some of the highest rates ever recorded.\n\nThe study also comes on the heels of news of the cascade of failures of Obamacare as well as the collapse of many Obamacare state exchanges despite the President\u2019s claim that his signature healthcare policy would help Americans live longer, more fulfilling and healthy lives.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Death Rates for Middle Aged Whites On The Rise in Failing Obama Economy", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Death Rates for Middle Aged Whites On The Rise in Failing Obama Economy", "title": "Death Rates for Middle Aged Whites On The Rise in Failing Obama Economy", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/GettyImages-481285556-sanders.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-11-02T18:25:31-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/02/study-obamas-bad-economy-kills-almost-500000-middle-age-white-people/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Death Rates for Middle Aged Whites On The Rise in Failing Obama Economy", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/11/GettyImages-481285556-sanders.jpg", "title": "Death Rates for Middle Aged Whites On The Rise in Failing Obama Economy", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "economy, Obama, Whites,Big Government, Cronyism, Obama,Obama", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-11-02T18:25:15-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-11-02T18:25:31-07:00", "tag": "Whites", "categories": "Big Government,Obama,Cronyism"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERThe death rates for middle-aged whites in America is increasing, reversing a decades-long decline, says a new released analysis of national statistics.\nDeaton\u2019s work revealed that since the 1970s the death-rate for middle-aged whites has been declining at about 2 percent per year.\nBut for 2013\u2013the last year for which statistics are available\u2013the death rates for that sector increased by half a percent for the first time.\n\u201cThose are the people who have really been hammered by the long-term economic malaise,\u201d Deaton says in his report.\nOnly whites in the U.S. are dying at an increased rate."}
