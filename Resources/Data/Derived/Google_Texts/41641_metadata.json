No? Well SERMO is the largest online physician community in the world. Over 300,000 US physicians use the network, which was developed by doctors in Boston and acquired by WorldOne Interactive in 2012. The site allows physicians to share notes, talk about difficult to understand diseases, and to help each other diagnose health problems.\n\nOn Thursday, a project from two of SERMO\u2019s founding physicians, Dr. Daniel Palestrant and Dr. Adam Sharp, called par8o (pronounced par-eight-oh), announced that it has raised $10.5 million in Series A funding to help organize the mess that is the current state of healthcare.\n\nFounded in 2012, Newton-based par8o\u2019s name is a sly reference to Vilfred Pareto. He was an Italian economist and sociologist who promoted the idea of income equality and is the namesake of the Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, which theorizes that in business, 80 percent of the effect come from 20 percent of the causes (i.e. doctors might spend 80 percent of their time dealing with 20 percent of their patients, in terms of tracking their health status and unravelling their healthcare information).\n\nAs the company explains it, par8o is in line with the idea of Pareto Optimization, a powerful economic principle that succeeds because it is well-suited to the complex, multiconstituency nature of health care.\n\nPalestrant explained that par8o\u2019s roots stem back to just before SERMO was acquired by WorldOne, the company was invited to meet with the senior leadership of Johnson & Johnson which was at the time a customer of SERMO. \u201cThey were very forward looking at the time, and they were trying to figure out where health care was going, and they wanted to do something truly innovative,\u201d he said.\n\nAs so happened, the team that eventually became par8o had already been working on building a technology that could match \u201cthe right patient to the right resource at the right time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had been reading the tea leaves that as the Affordable Care Act went from legislation to implementation, the key challenge that we would face as an industry, and as a country, would be how to do more with less,\u201d Palestrant said. \u201cHow to take more people into a health care system and both improve quality and lower costs.\u201d\n\nAfter the discussion with Johnson & Johnson, the group received a $2 million grant to start the health care-focused project. After the WorldOne acquisition, Palestrant and Sharp traded in their equity in SERMO and, in Palestrant\u2019s words, \u201cdoubled down on par8o.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s online platform is a way for physicians to navigate the current quagmire that is the relationship between providers, patients, and the health care industry. Specifically, par8o is a cloud-based tool that allows doctors to more efficiently check patient\u2019s insurance plans, the resources available in their specific health care network, and a patient\u2019s clinical indication. Through the platform, physicians can make sure that patients can get to the next step in their care, without putting their faith in the patient and their health care system being able to work through their care plans on their own. Palestrant calls par8o \u201chealth care\u2019s operating system,\u201d which creates a cohesive network between patients, payers, and providers in the different parts of the health care system.\n\nCurrently, par8o has a less than 50 employees, but plans to build out its team. It already has established partnerships with MGM Resorts, the Harvard Medical School affiliated hospitals in Boston, and those that are part of the Mount Sinai Health System in New York.\n\nThe new funding comes from Atlas Venture, Founder Collective, CHV Capital, Allscripts and other investors.\n\nAtlas Venture (or Formerly Known as Atlas) partner Jeff Fagnan said of the company, \u201cDaniel and Adam are mission-based, committed to improving the patient experience and ensuring greater transparency. Par8o\u2019s first offering around cloud based referral management is a multibillion-dollar market today in a space that has lacked automation and sound business judgement.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Palestrant is upbeat about more than just the new funding, saying that he is grateful not only for the company\u2019s investors, but also the Boston tech community and its support. \u201cI am so appreciative of this startup ecosystem that we have here and that we are a part of,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the end of the day, a health care operating system is pretty cool, better quality care and lower costs. We are finding that it is resonating.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"description": "Have you ever heard of SERMO? No?\u00a0Well SERMO is the largest online physician community in the world.
