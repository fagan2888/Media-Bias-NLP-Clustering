On Kauai, however, homeless numbers dropped nearly 10 percent, according to a new University of Hawaii report.\n\nOf Hawaii\u2019s 14,282 homeless people in 2014 (an increase from 13,853 in 2013), Kauai accounted for 632 (down from 699 in 2013) \u2014 or 4.4 percent.\n\nMaBel Ferreiro-Fujiuchi, CEO of Kauai Economic Opportunity, Inc., said she could not explain the island\u2019s drop and hasn\u2019t noticed a decrease in demand for KEO services.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing,\u201d she said of the reported decrease, which she believes could be attributed to an increase in services, as well as homeless people leaving the island for one reason or another. \u201cBut I don\u2019t hold my breath on that because it can change really quickly.\u201d\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t surprise her to see numbers increase in coming months, with winter right around the corner and the Mainland already experiencing severe weather.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re homeless, you try to go where you can survive a little bit better,\u201d Ferreiro-Fujiuchi said.\n\nOriginally from Southern California, Mark Anthony Smith, 34, is homeless on Kauai.\n\nSmith was diagnosed with a mental health disorder while he was a teenager; his family disowned him after he started taking drugs. He cleaned up his act, got married and was pursuing vocational schooling when he relapsed. His wife divorced him seven years ago, and from there he became part-time homeless, living on his disability money and working around the country.\n\n\u201cI have been clean from meth for seven years,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSmith was most recently in Alaska for several months, working at the canneries. He said the shelters there have a \u201c30-day in and 30-day out\u201d rule, but it worked because there were two shelters in the town where he worked.\n\nA lot of homeless people die in Alaska because of the cold, he said, so when the work dried up he used his disability check to fly to Kauai. Now, he finds himself on Kauai\u2019s streets with two serious medical conditions that can\u2019t be treated until he has a residence.\n\nThe latest findings on homelessness were released Friday in the \u201cHomeless Service Utilization Report: Hawaii 2014,\u201d a joint study by the University of Hawaii, Manoa, and the state Department of Human Services. Much of the statewide jump can be attributed to increases in Hawaii County, which experienced a 49 percent bump in its homeless population since 2013.\n\nStatewide, 1,767 adults (16 percent) reported living in Hawaii for less than five years, with one-third arriving in the past 12 months. On Kauai, 83 (13 percent) arrived in the last five years and 20 (3.8 percent) in the past 12 months.\n\n\u201cWe kind of see new people all the time,\u201d Ferreiro-Fujiuchi said.\n\nJoni Lesser-Benton, a clinical social worker on Kauai, said that while she hasn\u2019t seen an increase in homeless clients in her private practice, she has noticed new faces on the street.\n\nOne possible cause, she said, is what is known in the medical field as \u201cbuff and turf,\u201d a practice in which patients are medically stabilized and given a ticket and enough medication to get to another place \u2014 in this case, by plane to Hawaii.\n\nLesser-Benton said she saw an influx in the number of victims of this practice while working in Santa Cruz, California, and expects it is occurring here as well.\n\n\u201cThe agencies just get tired of folks that they see over and over and over again, and they\u2019ll just put somebody on a bus or plane or train,\u201d she said.\n\nThe result, according to Lesser-Benton, is mentally unstable people finding themselves in an unknown place with no support, which can send them into crisis mode.\n\nThe recent UH study also details the number of people considered chronically homeless. On Kauai, 125 individuals (26 percent) fell into that category, meaning they have been homeless continuously for at least one year or have had at least four episodes of being homeless in the past three years.\n\nOne Kauai resident who fits that definition is a man who identified himself solely as Jeff. A recovering alcoholic, now five years sober, Jeff has been living out of his van for the last three years. But he doesn\u2019t see himself as homeless; rather, he calls it retirement.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a two bedroom,\u201d he laughed through his long, graying beard as he made coffee.\n\nOne bedroom inside. Another on the roof, where he often sleeps to watch the stars.\n\nWhile Jeff claims to chose his lifestyle, he admits it is not easy. People like him are often stigmatized.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a crime to be homeless,\u201d he said. \u201cBut people treat you like it is.\u201d\n\nJeff moved to Hanalei from Los Angeles in 1979 and has been here ever since. He lived in houses and worked \u2014 or \u201cplayed the game,\u201d as he calls it \u2014 for 30 years. Now, he doesn\u2019t. And being the religious man that he is, Jeff points out his similarities to Jesus, who also had no home or cell phone.\n\nAsked what it takes to live his transient lifestyle, Jeff paraphrased a quote from Benjamin Franklin: \u201cMind your pennies, the dollars take care of themselves.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, according to the study, Kauai\u2019s homeless consisted of 486 adults and 146 children. Persons in families accounted for 45 percent.\n\nWhile Hawaii\u2019s warm weather may be a factor in having one of the country\u2019s highest rates of homelessness, Ferreiro-Fujiuchi said she doesn\u2019t believe it makes it any easier.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is a good place to be homeless,\u201d she said.\n\nLesser-Benton points out that the high cost of living counters the warm climate. And once here, she said it is hard for the homeless to scrounge together enough money to leave.\n\n\u201cTrapped in paradise,\u201d she said.\n\nAmong the services offered by KEO are its Care-A-Van program, a mobile unit providing services on-site where homeless congregate, as well as an emergency shelter and transitional housing program.\n\nIn any given month, the Care-A-Van services between 250-300 individuals, providing them with basic medical needs, living items and food, according to Ferreiro-Fujiuchi.\n\nCounty of Kauai Housing Director Kamuela Cobb-Adams said the Housing Agency administers assistance through Section 8 and rental opportunities at Kalepa Village in Hanamaulu or Paanau Village 1 or 2 in Koloa; however, both projects tend to be full and there is a waiting list.\n\nSince 2008, the county has opened up new affordable units in Waipouli, Lihue and Koloa, according to Cobb-Adams. Affordable projects are under construction in Princeville, Lihue and Eleele.\n\n\u201cWe continue to seek new opportunities for affordable housing and are moving forward with Lima Ola in Eleele (potentially 500 affordable units), 130-unit project in Poipu and the second phase of the Rice Camp Senior Housing in Lihue as quickly as possible,\u201d she wrote in an email.\n\nThe UH report comes at time when Honolulu is seeking ways to solve its homelessness problem. In November, the Institute for Human Services launched an initiative to help homeless people find their way back to the Mainland.\n\nTo view the 2014 Homeless Service Utilization Report, visit http://uhfamily.hawaii.edu/.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nChris D\u2019Angelo, environment writer, can be reached at 245-0441 or cdangelo@thegardenisland.com.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Thegardenisland.com", "description": "LIHUE \u2014 In the last fiscal year, the state\u2019s homeless population increased by 3 percent.
