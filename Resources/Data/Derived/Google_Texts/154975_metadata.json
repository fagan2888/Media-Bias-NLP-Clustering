Scott Walker.\n\nIn response to the tragic news, Erin Gloria Ryan, news editor at Jezebel.com, posted a despicable comment:\n\nRyan quickly had second thoughts and deleted the tweet, but a firestorm of criticism was already building. She posted an apology that read: \u201cNo excuse. It was dumb. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d And then a follow up tweet as the firestorm continued to build:\n\nI don\u2019t wish death on anyone. Joking about that was insensitive and inappropriate. \u2014 Erin Gloria Ryan (@morninggloria) December 1, 2013\n\nAs for the wave of criticism, Twitchy.com chronicled some of tweets directed at Ryan:\n\nLeave it to Jezebel to wish death on someone they disagree with politically in the wake of a tragic event https://t.co/2XOyGHdlTx \u2014 Jason B.
