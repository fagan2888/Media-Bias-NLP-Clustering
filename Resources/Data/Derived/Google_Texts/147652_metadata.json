While he and his five-piece band, not including two backup singers, continually laid it down, following his own mantra \u2014 \u201cMake it funky!\u201d \u2014 the show also downshifted with more than its share of more tender musical moments. Mr. Parker didn\u2019t announce many of the titles of the songs, so I can only approximate some of them.\n\nMr. Parker played his horn with a clipped-note phrasing \u2014 very little, if anything, smooth \u2014 that befits the driving but controlled and well-paced R&B that he has always done. But he did more singing than playing. He had said that he learned a lot from working with Mr. Brown, and it was easy to see that.\n\nAt the end of many numbers, Mr. Parker said, \u201cHow about the band?\u201d while sweeping toward the members. Keyboardist William Boulware, an absolute monster, did a lot of synthesized organ that recalled Tower of Power (Mr. Brown being one of that band\u2019s influences). Bassist Rodney \u201cSkeet\u201d Curtis slapped his way through \u201cOff the Hook\u201d and added some double-stops in the process. Trombonist Greg Boyer regularly stretched into trumpet range, especially on \u201cJust Gimme Some More,\u201d though not always cleanly.\n\nProbably the highlight of the show was background vocalist and Mr. Parker\u2019s cousin Darlene Parker\u2019s spirited rendition of Ben E. King\u2019s \u201cStand by Me,\u201d during which Mr. Parker also played some flute; they did a back-and-forth out of the same mike. Not far behind was a semi-instrumental version of \u201cLet\u2019s Get It On,\u201d intended as a tribute to Marvin Gaye. Former SOS Band guitarist Bruno Speights added the flute/guitar lines to \u201cBreezin.\u2019 \u201d Trouble was that Mr. Speights\u2019 lead line was inaudible, so you might not have recognized it right away.\n\nI did mention jazz, did I not? Mr. Parker, generally accompanied by Mr. Boulware on \u201cpiano,\u201d came up with a sped-up swing rendition of \u201cSatin Doll\u201d and, later, \u201cSomeone to Watch Over Me.\u201d It might be worth his while to play an entire concert or album of just jazz. I think he can pull it off.\n\nThe show closed with the Brown classic \u201cPass the Peas,\u201d which finally got everyone up, a line from Parliament\u2019s \u201cFlash Light\u201d working its way in. But he made sure he got this phrase in throughout the evening: \u201cWe love you.\u201d\n\nRick Nowlin: rnowlin@post-gazette.com or 412-263-3871.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Maceo Parker, best known for his association with the late James Brown, hit town for a Friday evening concert.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "Alto saxophonist and band leader Maceo Parker, best known for his association with the late James Brown, always promises his concerts will be \u201c2 percent jazz, 98 percent funk.\u201d He not only delivered the groove on Friday at the Byham Theater but also threw in more jazz than might be expected as well as a couple of other surprises.
