Planned job cuts announced by U.S.-based businesses in June were at their lowest level yet of 2014, dropping 41 percent last month after reaching a 15-month high in May. With employers holding the line on firings as the economy improves, this could be a hopeful sign for labor market growth.

Last month there were 31,434 anticipated job cuts announced; that’s 20 percent lower than the same month a year ago, and much lower than May’s 52,961 cuts, according to a report Thursday from Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, Inc.

The top job-cutting sector in June was entertainment and leisure activity, due mostly to the closure of two casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Through the first half of the year, the most layoffs occurred in the computer industry, where companies announced their intent to cut 30,002 jobs. With 26,863 planned job cuts through June, retailers also experienced heavy downsizing.

“The holidays were not kind to several retailers who answered with heavy layoffs in the first quarter,” said John Challenger, CEO of Challenger, Gray & Christmas. “We saw large scale job cut announcements from Macy’s, Best Buy, J.C. Penney and Sears to start out the year. Meanwhile, one of the largest job cuts of the year so far resulted from the bankruptcy of Coldwater Creek, which resulted in 5,500 layoffs.”

Challenger pointed out that the retail industry does continue to grow, though, and employment is vulnerable to changes in technology and consumer demand. He also noted that change in the technology sector occurs rapidly and “some of the larger, less nimble companies are sometimes forced to alter their course and that can be painful.”

For example, he said, in the first part of the year, Hewlett-Packard and Intel both announced large layoffs.
