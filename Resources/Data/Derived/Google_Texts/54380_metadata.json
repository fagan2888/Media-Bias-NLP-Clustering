In 2013, the state issued 160 permits, and 92 wells were drilled.\n\nTayfur's attorney, Mary Bower Sheats, is appealing the bankruptcy judge's ruling, arguing that while Tayfur signed the lease, the company never did, and Pennsylvania landlord-tenant law requires both parties to sign.\n\n\u201cI think the oil and gas company should have to sign the lease if they want it to be binding,\u201d Sheats said.\n\nTayfur did not return a message left for him through Sheats.\n\nThe company maintains that landlord-tenant law doesn't apply in oil and gas leases. The bankruptcy judge agreed. The company also argued that it paid Tayfur what the lease required.\n\n\u201cMr. Tayfur was fairly compensated for his oil and gas lease,\u201d Shell spokeswoman Deborah Sawyer said in an emailed statement, \u201cMaintaining the valid, contractual rights of that lease is a priority for Shell. We have honored the contracts enforced by the bankruptcy court and will continue to do so. If the appellate process results in a different decision, we will honor that as well.\u201d\n\nIn his Feb. 26 ruling, Chief U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Jeffery A. Deller for the Western District of Pennsylvania called Tayfur's lawsuit a case of buyer's remorse \u201cas a result of the recent Marcellus shale activity in the Western Pennsylvania region.\u201d\n\nAccording to court documents, Tayfur, 61, signed a lease on Dec. 28, 2005, with Central Appalachian Petroleum. The following July, the drilling rights were transferred to East Resources. Royal Dutch Shell bought East Resources in 2010.\n\nTayfur received annual payments of $321 from the drilling companies, as called for by the lease. He could have made about $300,000 had there been drilling, but none of the companies drilled on Tayfur's property, according to court documents.\n\n\u201cIt is low, but it was not uncommon back then,\u201d said Downtown attorney David Zimmaro, referring to contracts signed between 2005 through 2008. \u201cA lot of people signed at this low-ball number.\n\nZimmaro has represented landowners in Marcellus shale cases but is not involved in the Tayfur case.\n\n\u201cJust because they underpaid you \u2014 you didn't get what is considered a fair market value \u2014 you're never getting out of that,\u201d Zimmaro said.\n\nPine Attorney Harry Klodowski, who is assisting with Tayfur's case, said that today's standard lease agreements usually pay $3,000 an acre over a five- or 10-year lease.\n\nKlodowski admitted that Tayfur \u201creally didn't think about what he was doing\u201d when he signed the lease in 2005.\n\n\u201cGas leases were selling for peanuts back then.\u201d\n\nIn his Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing in 2011, Tayfur said that if he could get out from under the SWEPI lease, he could get a better lease to make more money.\n\nSWEPI attorney Kirk Burkley, of Pittsburgh, wrote in an October court filing that the company has leases on all properties surrounding Tayfur's, except for property that borders Moraine State Park.\n\n\u201cNo other parties will lease the oil and gas rights from (Tayfur),\u201d Burkley wrote.\n\nTo successfully break a lease outside of a bankruptcy, property owners have to prove fraud in the initial lease, Zimmaro said. And courts have only ruled on that about a half-dozen times, he said.\n\nBill Vidonic is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
