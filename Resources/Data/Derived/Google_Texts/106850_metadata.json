(WLFI) \u2013 With two weeks until Election Day, candidates are making their final push for votes.\n\nIn the 4th Congressional District, Republican Todd Rokita is vying for a third term, facing off with Democratic candidate John Dale.\n\nThe two men attended a pair of candidate forums Tuesday night. First, each man gave a introductory speech of six minutes in a \u201cMeet the Candidates\u201d night at Danville High School.\n\nAbout an hour later, they went head-to-head in a debate at Crawfordsville High School in an event sponsored by the League of Women Voters.\n\nThe debate showcased the differences between the candidates on a variety of issues before about 75 people.\n\nThe audience asked the men more than a dozen questions on topics like deficit reduction, size of government, the Affordable Care Act and the candidates\u2019 willingness to compromise across party lines if elected.\n\nOne of the biggest contrasts that kept coming up was on topics like climate change, fossil fuels and renewable energy.\n\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t facts. Ninety-seven of some of the liberal scientists who were polled believe that humans are doing this,\u201d said Rokita. \u201cThis is not settled science. Just like perhaps many of these same scientists, 97 percent perhaps, believe there is no God. But they don\u2019t know. There\u2019s no science on that. So scientists are like the rest of us. You can have beliefs, but that doesn\u2019t make it science.\u201d\n\nDale rebutted, \u201cI have to go with the 97 percent of scientists, liberal and conservative scientists. If 20 percent of scientists told me some kind of soda was going to hurt my kids, I wouldn\u2019t let my kids drink that soda. Ninety-seven percent, I have to believe in their expertise and advice.\u201d\n\nAnother interesting contrast was when the candidates were asked to rate President Obama on a scale of one to 10.\n\nDale gave the president a six or seven for his support of public schools, but faulted him for being partly to blame for gridlock.\n\nRokita gave the president a one or two, stating the country is leaderless, citing examples like the IRS scandal and the expansion of food stamps.\n\nThe differences between incumbent and challenger were also highlighted in closing remarks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been my humble and highest honor to be your representative. There are big issues, huge issues,\u201d said Rokita. \u201cThere\u2019s a fight going on for the heart and soul of this nation right now, more than I\u2019ve ever seen it, perhaps more than you\u2019ve ever seen it. So these decisions, which one of us you are going to have to represent the 700,000 of us are very important.\u201d\n\nDale replied, \u201cCongress\u2019 approval rating was in the single-digits. It reached up to 16 percent now. The definition of insanity is voting the same people in and expecting different results. They\u2019ve shown what they\u2019re going to do in the past. If you guys are happy with that, vote for the incumbent. If you\u2019re ready for change, vote for me.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll have a profile of both men in the District 4 race on News 18\u2019s Weekend Report on Sunday.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nPrint\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "CRAWFORDSVILLE, Ind.
