The petition delivery kicks off several days of action in Washington that includes visits to Senators and members of Congress by AARP volunteers from every state on issues that include eliminating conflicts of interest in retirement advice, the Older Americans Act, the Safe Streets Act, the bipartisan Assisting Caregivers Today (ACT) Caucus, and Social Security trust fund solvency, as well as thanking those who helped to pass a \u201cdoc fix\u201d law that allows Medicare beneficiaries to keep seeing their physicians. Tweet It\n\n\n\n\u201cThis week AARP volunteers from every state urged Congress and the Obama administration to address a variety of issues to ensure we have laws that protect and enhance health and economic security for current and future generations,\u201d said Nancy LeaMond, Chief Advocacy and Engagement Officer, AARP. \u201cWe delivered petitions today to ensure that all financial advisers put their clients\u2019 interests first. We\u2019ll also head to Congress to discuss health, safety and economic issues that impact millions of American families.\u201d\n\nAmong the issues that AARP volunteers and staff will raise with members of the House and Senate from every state are:\n\nFinancial Conflicts of Interest : In addition to bringing petitions to the U.S. Department of Labor, AARP volunteers continue to speak to members of Congress about AARP\u2019s opposition to any legislation that seeks to stop or slow a proposed rule requiring all retirement advisers to give advice in their clients\u2019 best interest. Each year hidden fees, unfair risk and bad investment advice rob Americans of $17 billion of retirement income.\n\n: In addition to bringing petitions to the U.S. Department of Labor, AARP volunteers continue to speak to members of Congress about AARP\u2019s opposition to any legislation that seeks to stop or slow a proposed rule requiring all retirement advisers to give advice in their clients\u2019 best interest. Each year hidden fees, unfair risk and bad investment advice rob Americans of $17 billion of retirement income. The Older Americans Act (S.192) : The reauthorization of the bipartisan Older Americans Act would help ensure the continued array of programs and services to assist, protect, nourish and sustain the nation\u2019s seniors with maximum dignity and independence. Since 2010, AARP has consistently supported and urged a simple reauthorization to protect the core programs of this crucial law.\n\n: The reauthorization of the bipartisan would help ensure the continued array of programs and services to assist, protect, nourish and sustain the nation\u2019s seniors with maximum dignity and independence.

The Safe Streets Act : Expected to be reintroduced today in the House, the bipartisan Safe Streets Act would ensure that planners and traffic engineers design, construct, and operate roads with the safety of all users in mind by directing states and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) to create a \"safe streets\" policy within two years of enactment. The policy would be different for each locality based on their individual communities.\n\n: Expected to be reintroduced today in the House, the bipartisan would ensure that planners and traffic engineers design, construct, and operate roads with the safety of all users in mind by directing states and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) to create a \"safe streets\" policy within two years of enactment.

Assisting Caregivers Today (ACT) Caucus: AARP backed the formation of the bipartisan, bicameral caucus as a forum to engage those in the House and Senate on family caregiving and living independently, exchange ideas, and build bipartisan relationships that can lead to solutions. Volunteers will seek to expand this important caucus. The caucus was launched in March of this year by U.S. Sens. Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) and Michael Bennet (D-CO) and U.S. Reps. Diane Black (R-TN) and Michelle Lujan Grisham (D-NM).\n\nAARP backed the formation of the bipartisan, bicameral caucus as a forum to engage those in the House and Senate on family caregiving and living independently, exchange ideas, and build bipartisan relationships that can lead to solutions.

Social Security: If Congress does not address the shortfall in the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) trust fund, children, veterans, older workers, families and others who receive disability insurance benefits may face a 20% cut in their benefits. AARP seeks a reallocation of the trust funds with improved program integrity measures.\n\n###\n\nAbout AARP\n\nAARP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, with a membership of nearly 38 million, that helps people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning, affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.
