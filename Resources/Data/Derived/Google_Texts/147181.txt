Is there a point at which you can officially declare him the nation's Troll-in-Chief? At this point he could accidentally nuke Vermont and still blame racism for the falling approval ratings.

Barack Obama said that racial tensions may have softened his popularity among white voters within the last two years, according to a story posted on the New Yorker magazine’s website today. “There’s no doubt that there’s some folks who just really dislike me because they don’t like the idea of a black president,” Obama said.

For his first term, these crazy racist white voters liked him just fine. And then suddenly, coinciding with his implementation of a disastrous national health care problem that destroyed health insurance for millions of people, they turned on him... because they're racists.

Obama never fails at anything. He just gets hit with the racism stick.

It's not the bad $600 million website. It's not the millions who are paying more for health insurance. It's not his attack on religious freedom. It's all about racism.

“There is a historic connection between some of the arguments that we have politically and the history of race in our country, and sometimes it’s hard to disentangle those issues,” Obama said.

No, it's not actually. If you had high approval ratings and they sank after a policy you championed turned bad, that's not racism. It's all you.
