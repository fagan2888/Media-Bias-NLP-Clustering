Apparently, no one told Target.\n\nIn the backlash to North Carolina\u2019s passage of a so-called bathroom law aimed at the transgender community, the discount retailer has voiced its opposition to the law in a big way. \u201cWe welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity,\u201d the company declared.\n\nTarget was by no means the first corporation to speak out \u2014 Paypal, American Airlines, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, and other Fortune 500 companies have all expressed their opposition to the North Carolina law. Yet Target is now being targeted by conservative consumers in the backlash to the backlash.\n\nThe American Family Association says it has gathered more than 1 million signatures calling for a boycott of the popular discount retailer.\n\nProtesters have also threatened to test Target\u2019s bathroom policy by sending in men into women\u2019s restrooms at Target stores. That has already led to one arrest near Chicago.\n\nSo was this a strategic mistake on Target\u2019s part?\n\nMaybe not. Recent surveys and studies show that there can be a sound business reason for companies to wade into such a controversial issues.\n\nIn recent years, Americans seem to have embraced the notion that the private sector has a role in shaping the political debate, according surveys by the public relations firm Global Strategy Group. In the most recent survey \u2014 the results of which were published in January \u2014 78% of Americans said that \u201ccorporations should take action to address important issues facing society.\u201d That\u2019s up from 72% in 2013.\n\nTo be sure, Americans tend to think it\u2019s more \u201cappropriate\u201d for companies to take stands on economic issues such as the minimum wage, pay equality, and parental leave. Still, a majority also think it is suitable for companies to weigh in on social and political issues ranging from LGBT equality to Obamacare to race relations.\n\nHow effective can CEO\u2019s be at changing the electorate\u2019s mind? That\u2019s not entirely clear.\n\nBut changing minds may not be the only reason the C-Suite is speaking out.\n\n\u201cCEO activism might not be about moving the needle on how people think, but might be rallying supporters to their side who actually get excited about buying the products,\u201d says Aaron Chatterji, an associate professor at Duke University\u2019s Fuqua School of Business.\n\nIn other words, this could be an opportunity to show potential customers that the brand is aligned with their world view.\n\nOf course, partisanship cuts both ways \u2014 in other words, companies like Target could also end up alienating customers who don\u2019t share its views. But in a recent paper entitled \u201cDo CEO Activists Make a Difference?\u201d Prof. Chatterji and Michael Toffel of Harvard Business School found that \u201cunder some conditions the benefits can outweigh the costs.\u201d\n\nThe professors conducted a field experiment that sought to isolate Apple CEO\u2019s Tim Cook ability to weigh in on another controversial law \u2014 Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which passed last year. Critics said the law would discriminate against LGBT consumers, while proponents believed the law simply protected religious rights.\n\nCook voiced his opposition to the measure, as did the CEOs from Salesforce.com and Angie\u2019s List. Shortly thereafter the Indiana state government changed the law \u201cto clarify that this new judicial standard would not create a license to discriminate or to deny services to any individual as its critics have alleged,\u201d according Gov. Mike Pence.\n\nBut how much of this reversal was due to Cook?\n\nTo determine that, the authors started by asking survey respondents whether they supported the law. They then prefaced the question with a statement from Cook and other notable figures that said the law was discriminatory. They also included a preface without attribution \u2014 for example: \u201csome believe the law may allow discrimination against gays and lesbians in that state.\u201d\n\nIt turned out that adding a clause that said some people found the law discriminatory made the law less popular. \u201cThe result is that the framing matters a lot,\u201d says Chatterji. \u201cOnce discrimination is mentioned, support the law goes down.\u201d\n\nDoes that mean Cook\u2019s activism actually made a difference? Not quite. \u201cWho mentions the discrimination does not seem to matter,\u201d says Chatterji.\n\nCalculator: What is my risk tolerance?\n\nCook was, however, able to communicate something else. By speaking out against the law, he was able to signal to same-sex marriage proponents that Apple supported their cause, thus engendering goodwill.\n\nWhat about same-sex marriage opponents? \u201cIn our study, we see the benefits from consumers who agree with him outweighing the costs of those who disagree,\u201d says Chatterji.\n\nBut he adds that it is \u201cnot clear at all that this applies in all cases.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Executives may end up improving sales more than social policy by speaking out.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "MONEY.com", "description": "Executives might improve sales more than social policy", "title": "Who Benefits When CEOs Attack the N.C.
