 Kansas officials are dealing with a backlog of about 7,000 people who are seeking Medicaid coverage, and some advocates are concerned the backlog will start hurting the quality of care in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.

The backlog of applications has prompted the Kansas Department of Health and Environment to do something it rarely does: approve claims payments — or at least partial ones — for people who are not officially enrolled in the Medicaid program.

KDHE sent out a notice late last week saying it would begin authorizing “advance payments” to nursing homes and long-term care facilities, paying them one half of their normal daily rate for patients whose Medicaid enrollments or reauthorizations have not yet been approved.

“You are no doubt aware that the Kansas Department of Health and the Environment (KDHE) has been experiencing delays in processing applications for Medicaid benefits,” the agency said in an notice to care providers. “Until these delays are resolved, KDHE has agreed to issue advance payments to qualified long-term care providers that submit advance payment requests for specific applicants who are awaiting an eligibility determination.”

KDHE said Tuesday that about 7,000 applications for Medicaid coverage have been waiting more than 45 days. Those include people applying for the first time as well as people submitting their annual applications to continue coverage.

Mitzi McFatrich, executive director of Kansas Advocates for Better Care, a group that lobbies on behalf of nursing home residents, said that backlog ultimately affects the quality of care patients receive because some facilities do not have the financial resources it takes to provide care for months on end without compensation.

“We’ve gotten a lot of reports about how long the backlog is,” she said. “We’ve heard of one person who applied in September, had all the required information submitted by November and was still waiting to hear back in January. He was finally approved in February, but during that time he’d been to four different nursing homes and four psychiatric facilities because nobody wanted to rack up the expense of caring for him for however many months it would take.”

McFatrich said she has also heard reports of people calling KDHE to find out the status of their applications and being put on hold for as long as an hour and a half.

KDHE spokeswoman Cassie Sparks attributed the backlog to three factors: a new automated application system that went live last year; an administrative move that shifted responsibility for processing Medicaid applications for elderly and disabled individuals to KDHE instead of the Department for Children and Families; and the federal government's open enrollment for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which she said increased Medicaid applications by 40 percent in November, December and January.

"KDHE is taking steps to improve wait times including adding staff and allowing additional time to return voicemails. Process improvements have also been made to address caller questions in a more timely manner," Sparks said.

Under the Medicaid program, nursing homes are entitled to receive retroactive payments for care they have provided while an application has been pending.

But McFatrich said she is also concerned about Medicaid beneficiaries who receive home and community based services — typically nonmedical services that enable elderly and disabled individuals who would otherwise qualify for long-term care to stay at home — because those providers are not entitled to retroactive payment.

“Those people are at risk of institutionalization because they’re not going to get the help they need,” she said.

State Sen. Laura Kelly, D-Topeka, who serves on a committee that oversees the state Medicaid program, known as KanCare, said she has been hearing complaints about the backlog as well.

“I’m particularly hearing from nursing home folks, generally the family of somebody who is in a nursing home,” she said. “You have to reapply every year. So what’s happening is they are getting dropped, and then they’re having to go through extraordinary hoops to get back on. Providers have to decide whether to keep them in the nursing home or kick them out.”

She said she expects the KanCare oversight committee to ask questions about the backlog and review the advance payment system at its next meeting April 18.

In its message to providers, KDHE said nursing homes and other long-term care facilities can apply for advance payments for patients whose applications have been pending longer than 60 days. It said priority will be given to smaller facilities, as opposed to large, corporate-owned facilities.

KDHE said once a nursing home applies for advance payment on behalf of a patient, the agency will conduct a "high-level triage" within 15 days to determine his or her likelihood of becoming eligible.

Once a patient has been approved for advance payment, KDHE will authorize payments through one of the private insurance companies that manage the program.

However, if the patient is later deemed to be ineligible, KDHE said, the nursing homes will be expected to refund the advance payments within 30 days, or else the balance will be deducted from future payments to that facility.
