Most recently, a Boulder-based nonprofit organization named him a finalist for the 2014 Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes. ( Picasa )\n\nEditor's note: The Times-Call's series Take Two revisits people and situations we have written about in the past. Take Two stories run on Mondays.\n\nBefore Milo Cress' voice drops from its boyish Mickey Mouse pitch to a manly timbre, he will have spoken across the United States and in more than a half-dozen countries promoting his \"Be Straw Free\" campaign.\n\nMilo, 13, landed on his environmentally friendly cause after ordering a glass of whole milk with his meal at Leunig's Bistro and Cafe in Burlington, Vt., his home state at the time.\n\nHe was 9 then, when he recognized the opportunity to reduce plastic waste by changing waitstaff protocol \u2014 to offer straws versus automatically serving them with soft drinks.\n\n\"It is something we can all do something about,\" said Milo, who moved with his family last summer from Longmont to Bend, Ore.\n\nEver since, he has won numerous awards and held forth with audiences including Congress, the Colorado State Legislature, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the National Restaurant Association's Best Practices Conference. CNN has chauffeured him by limousine to multiple studio interviews.\n\nMost recently, a Boulder-based nonprofit organization in October named him a finalist for the 2014 Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes.\n\nThe organization received roughly 400 nationwide nominations. It awarded $5,000 each to 15 winners and recognized Milo and nine others as honorees for exemplifying \"inspiring public spirit\" and making a \"significant positive difference\" in either environmental or humanitarian causes, Barbara Ann Richman, the nonprofit's executive director, said.\n\nBoulder author T.A. Barron named the award after his mother, who inspired the hero concept he uses in his fiction for the way she acted with compassion, courage, perseverance, hope and humor, she said.\n\n\"But when he would speak, he literally heard middle schoolers say, 'But that doesn't happen in real life.' ... Through this nonprofit, he could shine a spotlight on real life young heroes like Milo,\" she explained.\n\nTo make his mark, Milo first did his homework.\n\nHe researched the straw industry and discovered that in the United States alone about 500 million straws get used and discarded every day, which is enough to fill more than 46,400 large school buses each year. End to end, those buses would stretch more than 325 miles.\n\nThe environmental and cost savings of going strawless prompted Colo. Gov. John Hickenlooper to declare July 11 Straw Free Day statewide, a practice now encouraged year 'round by The National Restaurant Association and The Colorado Restaurant Association.\n\n\"There are more than 10,700 eating and drinking establishments in Colorado, so I would say that all adds up,\" Sonia Riggs, CRA's president and CEO, said. \"... We also encourage restaurants, incidentally, to offer water only upon request for the same reasons.\"\n\nBesides agreeing with the campaign's green stance, Denver-based Environmental Protection Agency spokesman Richard Mylott applauded Milo's moxy.\n\n\"Milo knows what it takes to transform an idea into results; being 13 is beside the point. He exemplifies the best kind of advocacy \u2014 practical, thoughtful and convincing,\" he said.\n\nThat explains Milo's latest mission, one he calls \"Let's Create the Future\" based on the Abraham Lincoln quote: \"The best way to predict the future is to help create it.\"\n\nHe wants to use his example to inspire other kids around the country and the world to see big possibilities in little changes.\n\n\"The straw campaign is one small step for each restaurant and one giant leap for the planet,\" he said.\n\nFor more information, visit www.bestrawfree.org (sponsored on Boulder-based Eco-Cycle's website) and www.barronprize.org.\n\nPam Mellskog can be reached at p.mellskog@gmail.com or at 303-746-0942.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27252846/not-last-straw-former-longmont-resident-gains-recognition", "modificationDate": "2015-01-05T13:07:16-0700", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0103/20150103__05TCATAKw~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Pam Mellskog \n \n  For the Times-Call", "description": "Before Milo Cress' voice drops from its boyish Mickey Mouse pitch to a manly timbre, he will have spoken across the United States and in more than a half-dozen countries promoting his \"Be Straw Free\" campaign.", "ag": {"canon": "LongmontTimes-Call:article:27252846:view"}, "startDate": "2015-01-04T11:00:00-0700", "og": {"url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27252846/not-last-straw-former-longmont-resident-gains-recognition", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0103/20150103__04tcatak2w~2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Before Milo Cress' voice drops from its boyish Mickey Mouse pitch to a manly timbre, he will have spoken across the United States and in more than a half-dozen countries promoting his \"Be Straw Free\" campaign.", "title": "Not the last straw: Former Longmont resident gains recognition for 'Be Straw Free' campaign"}, "twitter": {"domain": "timescall.com", "description": "Before Milo Cress' voice drops from its boyish Mickey Mouse pitch to a manly timbre, he will have spoken across the United States and in more than a half-dozen countries promoting his \"Be Straw Free\" campaign.", "title": "Not the last straw: Former Longmont resident gains recognition for 'Be Straw Free' campaign", "url": "http://www.timescall.com/longmont-local-news/ci_27252846/not-last-straw-former-longmont-resident-gains-recognition", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0103/20150103__04tcatak2w~2.jpg", "site": "@TimesCall", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-01-04T11:00:00-0700", "sailthru.site": "timescall.com", "endDate": "2025-01-03T16:50:51-0700", "sailthru.title": "Not the last straw: Former Longmont resident gains recognition for 'Be Straw Free' campaign", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Local News", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "google-site-verification": "lLtD9ZooxmJUEEdRSCVzkO06t_hYKtyDqZF7EA3N2U0", "byline": "By Pam MellskogFor", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site46/2015/0103/20150103__05TCATAKw~2.jpg", "pubDate": "2015-01-03T16:59:49-0700", "news_keywords": "Longmont Colorado TimesCall local news"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e99\"", "article_summary": "When Milo Cress moved from Longmont to Bend, Ore., he took his \"Be Straw Free\" campaign with him.\nJohn Hickenlooper to declare July 11 Straw Free Day statewide, a practice now encouraged year 'round by The National Restaurant Association and The Colorado Restaurant Association.\nMost recently, a Boulder-based nonprofit organization named him a finalist for the 2014 Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes.\nMost recently, a Boulder-based nonprofit organization in October named him a finalist for the 2014 Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes.\n\"The straw campaign is one small step for each restaurant and one giant leap for the planet,\" he said."}
