Bill Clinton will not be there to support Hillary Clinton tonight at the National Constitution Center's Liberty Medal ceremony.

Reps from the Constitution Center confirmed to me that the former president would not be in attendance. Clinton was recently on the road stumping for Obamacare and seen attending the U.S. Open. His Twitter account gives no indication of why he won't be in Philly tonight to support his wife, although he recently shouted out Philly-born basketball great Dawn Staley.

Either way, it's weird that Bill isn't there to support his wife receiving such a momentous award. He even received the award, along with George H.W. Bush, in 2006. Past recipients include Muhammad Ali, Tony Blair and Steven Spielberg.

Politically active actress Eva Longoria, a Hillary Clinton booster, was also scheduled to attend the Liberty Medal event tonight but will also no longer be showing support.

Why aren't they attending? Reps from the Constitution Center said Longoria had obligations on a film set, but she'll be in Watertown, Wisc. with Michelle Obama on Thursday. They stayed mum on the whereabouts of Bill.

ABC news' Elizabeth Vargas will emcee the event.
