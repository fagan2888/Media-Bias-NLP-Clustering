John Hickenlooper, is taking greater measures to protect the greater sage grouse in hopes of avoiding a federal listing.\n\nThe sage grouse in Colorado and 10 other western states has been imperiled in recent years as the bird loses habitat to development.\n\nThe federal government has to make a decision by a court-mandated Sept. 30 deadline on whether to list it as an endangered species.\n\nHickenlooper on Friday directed state agencies to take a number of actions. Whether such work will substitute for actual regulations to forest all a federal ESA listing is uncertain.\n\nHickenlooper\u2019s executive order includes:\n\n\u2022 Taking inventory of \u2014 and improving habitat within \u2013 state lands with grouse populations;\n\n\u2022 Launching a market-based habitat exchange;\n\n\u2022 Increasing efforts and coordination with Colorado Parks and Wildlife.\n\n\u201cWe firmly believe that state-led efforts are the most effective way to protect and conserve the greater sage grouse and its habitat,\u201d Hickenlooper wrote. \u201cConversely, a decision by the federal government to list the greater sage grouse under the Endangered Species Act would have a significant and detrimental economic impact to the state, as well as threaten the very state-led partnerships that are working to protect the species.\u201d\n\nOnce numbering in the millions, grouse have declined rapidly since 1985 to an estimated 200,000 to 500,000 due to agriculture, housing and industrial development.\n\nMuch of the state\u2019s greater sage grouse habitat, most of it in northwestern Colorado, is on BLM land.\n\nLast month, Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner introduced legislation to bar the federal government from making a decision on the greater sage grouse for six more years.\n\nHickenlooper\u2019s executive order also calls on strengthening the role of the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in relation to the bird.\n\n\u201cGovernor Hickenlooper\u2019s greater sage grouse executive order clearly illustrates the dedication of the state and all other stakeholders to ensuring that Colorado\u2019s sagebrush lands are protected,\u201d said Pete Maysmith, executive director with Conservation Colorado. \u201cThe historical declines in greater sage grouse populations have shown us that we need to restore balance to this ecosystem.\u201d\n\nKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kierannicholson", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Hickenlooper issues executive order aimed at sage grouse protection", "title": "Hickenlooper issues executive order aimed at sage grouse protection", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/15/hickenlooper-issues-executive-order-aimed-at-sage-grouse-protection/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150413__CD0412SAGEGROUSE-01p1-2.jpg", "height": 621}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150413__CD0412SAGEGROUSE-01p1-2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-15T14:44:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T15:20:40+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Wildlife"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc7dc\"", "article_summary": "John Hickenlooper, is taking greater measures to protect the greater sage grouse in hopes of avoiding a federal listing.\n\u201cThe historical declines in greater sage grouse populations have shown us that we need to restore balance to this ecosystem.\u201dKieran Nicholson: 303-954-1822, knicholson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/kierannicholson\nMuch of the state\u2019s greater sage grouse habitat, most of it in northwestern Colorado, is on BLM land.\nHickenlooper\u2019s executive order also calls on strengthening the role of the Oil and Gas Conservation Commission in relation to the bird.\n\u201cWe firmly believe that state-led efforts are the most effective way to protect and conserve the greater sage grouse and its habitat,\u201d Hickenlooper wrote."}
