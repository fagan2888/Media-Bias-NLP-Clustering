He talked about growth and change under the Republican administration, and briefly answered a few questions about refugees, illegal aliens and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBryant has been governor since 2012, and was just re-elected to his second term. Prior to becoming governor, he served one term as lieutenant governor and 11 years as state auditor. He also was in the House of Representatives for five years.\n\n[Mr. Bryant gave an overview of unemployment, economic development, education and other areas, but I suspect the things that most people will find interesting were said at the end, when he took a few questions from the audience. I\u2019m going to start with that, and then get into his speech. \u2013 Ed.]\n\nBryant was asked about his stance on Syrian refugees not being welcomed to this area, and what kind of feedback he\u2019s had since the terrorist attack in San Bernardino, Calif.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like anything,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cMost of the people who I believe are average Mississippians have come up to me and said \u2018thank you\u2019 and \u2018stand strong.\u2019 As you know, one of the terrorists who perpetrated the bombing attack in Paris was a Syrian refugee who had passed through Greece. They found his passport near his body. Eight Syrian refugees were found attempting to cross the border from Mexico. ICE stopped those, who we fully believe were going to perpetrate an attack similar to what you saw at San Bernardino.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all sympathetic Christian people, but why not create a safe zone in Syria to put these refugees in?\u201d Bryant said. \u201cGive them housing and food, let the United States military protect it and leave them at home?\n\n\u201cWe had an intelligence meeting yesterday with federal and state authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things that I had not thought about is that most of these towns in Syria have been totally destroyed and most of the government buildings have been knocked down and burned. When you\u2019re trying to do a background check on someone, it\u2019s not like it is here where you can call the FBI and give a social security number and a date of birth. There are no systems left in Syria to do this background check. So 10,000 undocumented, unknown Syrians are going to brought into the United States and sent throughout this country. We won\u2019t know who they are or what they\u2019re doing. And we\u2019re supposed to say that\u2019s fine.\n\n\u201cThe president in his speech the other night tried to divide everyone and say that you can\u2019t go out and blame all Muslims for this,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cI don\u2019t know of anyone who\u2019s doing that. I don\u2019t know anybody who says they\u2019re all bad. We just don\u2019t like the ones who try to kill us. I just don\u2019t want my family or your family or your friends shot or blown up. (Obama) said that we\u2019ve got to control assault weapons. He might not understand you can take a fully loaded 12-gauge shotgun loaded with buckshot and probably could\u2019ve killed more than than 14 people. So I guess that would be an assault rifle. I can\u2019t put you at risk to be politically correct. The director of the FBI said that there are gaps in our background checks, and those gaps can kill somebody.\u201d\n\nBryant was asked if the president could send refugees to Mississippi over his objections.\n\n\u201cHe can,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cWe reached out to our congressional delegation, and they\u2019ve got a bill in the Senate now. Of course the president will probably veto it, but that\u2019s how this republic works. It\u2019s got to get across his desk. If refugees come to Mississippi and try to get a driver\u2019s license, or try to seek DHS funding or enroll at a university, there are opportunities for us to identify people who are here on visas, like the young lady who was the wife who killed 14 people. If we\u2019ve got someone who happens to show up and ask for benefits and they say they\u2019re from Syria, I\u2019d like to know that. I\u2019d like to see if they\u2019re qualified for any benefit, and they probably are not, and also to see if they have a passport and where they\u2019re from. We\u2019re going to do everything in our power to identify them. If they get their feelings hurt because we want to try to talk to them, they\u2019ll just have to get their feelings hurt. We have a responsibility to know who they are and what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nBryant was asked the amount of money that the state spends on benefits to illegal aliens.\n\n\u201cI did an audit when I was state auditor on those costs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was $25 million a year then for education, health care, public benefits. That was probably a decade ago, and I think that number has probably doubled since then. I\u2019d guess that\u2019s $40 to $50 million a year we spend on people who are here illegally. It\u2019s very expensive to have that size population. We have a lot of people who are payed in cash, and they don\u2019t pay taxes on it. If you look at what the president did last summer, he basically opened the border and said everyone come in as quick as you can. There was a rush of people coming across the border, and we don\u2019t know where they\u2019re at now. We have a system where we have refugees that come into the state who are religious or political refugees. We\u2019ve had that for about 20 years now. I just looked at the list yesterday and two who came in about six months ago are from Afghanistan. I hope they\u2019re good Christian people, but we\u2019re already bringing in these refugees.\u201d\n\nBryant was asked about the Affordable Care Act\u2019s impact on the state.\n\n\u201cWe have a $90 million deficit now in Medicaid,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cMedicaid for the first time exceeded $1 billion state cost. We pay 25 percent, the federal government pays 75 percent. But our share exceeded $1 billion. When Obamacare started, everybody thought they had free Medicaid and they rushed out and signed up. The federal government won\u2019t allow us to do a face-to-face anymore, we have to do it online or on the telephone. If somebody can just get online and sign up for Medicaid, the federal government won\u2019t allow us to go out there and determine whether or not they\u2019re telling the truth.\u201d\n\n70,000 people have enrolled in Medicaid over the past three years, he said.\n\nFor the rest of his speech, Bryant focused on positive changes in the state.\n\n\u201cAs Republicans, we have different ideas than our friends in the opposing party,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be partisan today, but it\u2019s the Republican Women. We have different ideas. One, we think it\u2019s good to be successful on your own. We think American was built from the entrepreneurial spirit we see in many Mississippians, both men and women. In fact, Mississippi is number five in the nation in the growth of women-owned businesses. That\u2019s not the national narrative that you hear. That\u2019s an American Express study. I\u2019m sure MSNBC thinks we keep y\u2019all chained to wood-burning stoves down here. I travel the nation and tell them we\u2019re better than 45 other states.\n\n\u201cWe had a 9.5 percent unemployment rate when I came into office in 2011,\u201d Bryant said. \u201c(Rep. Jeff Smith, who was in the audience) remembers those days because he\u2019s helped us cut taxes 49 times. When I go back in January, we\u2019re going to make that an even 50. We brought in more tax revenue last year than at any time in Mississippi\u2019s history. More money will come in next year than any time in our history. You\u2019ll read editorials about how awful it is that we want to cut your taxes. They say we\u2019re cutting taxes on companies and corporations. It\u2019s because we brought in more money than at any time in Mississippi\u2019s history. We added 40,000 jobs. Our unemployment rate today is 5.9 percent. [Which is still the ninth highest in the country. \u2013 Ed.] Below 6 percent unemployment in Mississippi is remarkable, because we\u2019ve got a lot of people who were never trained to work. I said in my state of the state address that I wanted to find a job for every Mississippian who wants one. I have amended that. I want to find them a job even if they don\u2019t want one.\n\n\u201cWe got an award from a group \u2013 it\u2019s a conservative group, a non-profit \u2013 that said that we do a great job taking people off of welfare, off of food stamps, and putting them to work,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a good thing. I started reading the Bible again from the beginning, and I read about Adam and Eve, and I never realized this but God gave Adam a job before he gave him a wife. He said go tend that garden. Then he gave him a wife. I think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to work. We\u2019re helping 3,400 Mississippians who will come off of the food stamp program and go into a workforce training program. This is a federal grant from a bill signed by President Obama. That\u2019s one thing he did right. Remember the workfare bill that President Clinton signed in 1992? We trained people to work instead of just giving them something. We federally funded daycare centers so if you\u2019re a single mom you could put your child in a daycare center. We even paid for transportation. We\u2019re going back to those days. We are one of only 20 states who received that money to do this.\u201d\n\nBryant touted his educational agenda, including the third-grade reading gate.\n\n\u201cWe said that we shouldn\u2019t promote a child out of the third grade unless he can read on a third-grade level,\u201d he said. \u201cThey said, \u2018oh, he hates children.\u2019 I\u2019m a dyslexic child who repeated the third grade, and I\u2019ve had some moderate success in life. They\u2019ll be okay. They\u2019re going to be taught to read. They\u2019re not going to have the false impression that they\u2019re going to succeed by being passed when they\u2019re not prepared to do so.\n\n\u201cThree years ago we stopped the conveyer belt that all these children were on and we said we\u2019re going to teach them to read,\u201d he said. \u201cAt that time only 54 percent of the children in third grade were reading on a third-grade level. Last August, 92 percent passed. All of the superintendents and all of the principals got together and we spent $40 million in three years on reading coaches. We sent coaches into the schools to teach the teachers how to teach third graders how to read.\n\n\u201cWe fought for years to have charter schools,\u201d he said. \u201cThe educational establishment said we couldn\u2019t have them, that we\u2019re privatizing public schools. But they\u2019re not private schools, they\u2019re public schools. We\u2019ve got two in Jackson now. I think we\u2019ll have more in the future. I was at the grand opening of one in Jackson, and the population was 99 percent African American and they were excited. They were applauding their teacher. They have posters on the walls of what university or community college they want to attend. These were inner city Jackson children who had no hope. They were condemned to stay in that failing school and couldn\u2019t get out. Those children deserved better than that, and we put them into great schools.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have school choice,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think you ought to be able to take your money and be able to send your child to whatever school you want them to attend. Jeb Bush was in Jackson yesterday, and he said it was one of the hardest fights he had every been through. Why can\u2019t we do that? It\u2019s your money, your child. You\u2019ve got to get them there, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have to have a limit. They had a lottery in Florida. There are so few things that in America we tell you you can\u2019t choose. If you\u2019ve got enough money, you can choose where your child goes to school. You can send your child to private school, you can move so your child can go to a good school district. But if you\u2019re a single mom with several kids working two jobs, you can\u2019t move. You\u2019re there in a failing school district, and we\u2019re going to do everything we can not to let you out. That shouldn\u2019t be happening. They deserve an opportunity.\u201d\n\nBryant talked about the changes to redistricting.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the toughest battles I ever fought,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way it was happening forever was that you got to draw your own district lines. That\u2019s a pretty good job if you can get it. We said we want a fair redistricting plan. I fought it to a bloody nub, and I then I did something unusual: I read the constitution. It said redistricting was to happen in the year after the election. Then the guys came in and we were able to put in a fair plan. Because of that for the first time since Reconstruction we were able to put a good guy in the speaker\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cThen we said let\u2019s pass Voter ID so you actually have to show photo ID to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was screaming, gnashing of teeth. They said we\u2019re going to scare everybody out. They said particularly older people will be afraid to show their drivers license. Now the only population that can\u2019t vote is the recently deceased. We did take that right away from the dearly departed.\u201d\n\nBryant closed with the budget, and possible future rounds of BRAC.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped spending one-time money on reoccurring expenses,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cWe\u2019ve filled the rainy day fund. Louisiana and Alabama have large deficits. Huge deficits. You\u2019ve got $410 million in your savings account. The rainy day fund is statutorily full.\n\n\u201cYour air force base in Columbus is just remarkable,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight every day to make sure that it\u2019s not only stronger, but might be able to even take on more missions and more training. People say we\u2019re going to lose some of our military bases. I hope others places lose theirs and we get it. I don\u2019t want anybody to lose a base, but close some of those overseas and bring them back over here.\u201d\n\n0", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://packet-media.com/2015/12/bryant-talks-syria-at-lion-hills/", "image": "http://packet-media.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Bryant-300x263.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "BY BRIAN JONES brian.jones@packet-media.com COLUMBUS \u2013 Governor Phil Bryant spoke to a joint meeting of the Lowndes County Republican Women and ...", "title": "Bryant talks Syria at Lion Hills"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.2.6", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "They\u2019re not going to have the false impression that they\u2019re going to succeed by being passed when they\u2019re not prepared to do so.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all sympathetic Christian people, but why not create a safe zone in Syria to put these refugees in?\u201d Bryant said.\nBY BRIAN JONESbrian.jones@packet-media.comCOLUMBUS \u2013 Governor Phil Bryant spoke to a joint meeting of the Lowndes County Republican Women and Rotary Club at Lion Hills Nov. 8.\nI think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to work.\nThey\u2019re going to be taught to read."}
