She's from Coeburn, Va. and has no dental insurance. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nA gravel parking lot deep in the green hills of Virginia coal country was packed to capacity by 4 a.m. Friday. More than 1,500 people with canes, wheelchairs, oxygen tanks, bleeding gums, black lungs and other ills had come to the Wise County Fairgrounds, camping in tents, sleeping in pickup truck beds or scrunched up in their cars, hoping to see a doctor.\n\nAt midnight before the clinic opened, there were 1,204 people in line. And over the weekend, thousands more will come.\n\nThis is what health care looks like for many of the folks in this corner of southwest Virginia. And it will keep looking like this, thanks to state lawmakers who could have helped their most desperate constituents but instead blocked, bickered and weaseled until Virginia forfeited billions in Medicaid expansion funds. The result: More than 400,000 people who would have qualified for Medicaid coverage will continue to go uninsured.\n\nThis was hard for some of the people gathered here to stomach. They wish they could afford to go to a real doctor\u2019s office to get their blood checked or their rashes examined rather than the cow stalls and tents of this free clinic. The Remote Area Medical clinic sets up here every year, with volunteers providing free dental, eye and medical care to those in need.\n\nIts creator is Stan Brock, that guy us \u201970s kids saw on \u201cWild Kingdom\u201d chasing cheetahs while Marlin Perkins narrated. Brock saw poverty and need all over the world but was struck by the desperation he saw in America.\n\nAfter registering, Gary Mudei of Mt. Carmel, VA struggles to get to the dental area as he was hoping to get some work on his damaged teeth. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nSo now he walks through the tent in his familiar khakis and perfect posture. \u201cGod Bless you, Stan Brock!\u201d a woman in a wheelchair yells as he walks by. He nods and smiles.\n\nRAM has become part of the culture here. The schedule is printed across the entire front page of the Clinch Valley Times, and parking signs direct the parade of cars that roll in at all hours, slicing the early morning country stillness with city-loud rush-hour traffic.\n\nAt the fairgrounds, the pre-dawn darkness is illuminated by hundreds of tiny, orange lights \u2014 burning cigarettes \u2014 like fireflies. The smokers double down, because once they get past the chain-link fence and through the cattle stalls, volunteers tell them that they can\u2019t smoke in the clinic. And each medical tent \u2014 with rows and rows of chairs, lights, dental drills and other medical paraphernalia \u2014 has a big sign outside reminding everyone \u201cNo Weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou going to RAM? You go around this bend, then over the hill,\u201d the window guy at the McDonald\u2019s in Wise said over and over. At 3 a.m., there was a backup at the drive-through because all the people were asking for directions.\n\n\u201cJust tell them to go straight,\u201d the frustrated night manager told the window guy.\n\nWindow guy, who is 23, said he was going to RAM on Saturday.\n\n\u201cI need to get my top plate,\u201d he said, opening his mouth and running his studded tongue along the top row of gums. \u201cThey pulled all my top teeth out last year. I\u2019m going tomorrow, when it slows down a bit, to get new ones.\u201d\n\nHolly Delp of Dryden, Va. waits for his wife in the dental area as a volunteer gives directions to some incoming patients. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\nWindow guy can\u2019t get more than 30 hours a week at McDonald\u2019s, so he can\u2019t get employer-paid health insurance. \u201cI just wait all year for RAM. That\u2019s my health care.\u201d\n\nSame goes for the 31-year-old father who sat under a tent\u2019s sign that read \u201cFILLINGS.\u201d His two kids, 5 and 8, were sitting on his knees. They were getting three fillings between them.\n\nDad works in a deep coal mine. And his company doesn\u2019t give him insurance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because of Obama,\u201d he explained to me. \u201cObama is closing all the coal mines, so now the mines can\u2019t afford to offer us insurance.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama isn\u2019t popular here, despite the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which is designed to help the very people who flock to RAM.\n\nJim Huffman, 65, was a coal miner, trucker and farmer his whole life in Tazewell County. He walks with a cane, takes 27 medications every day and wears a pin in his trucker hat that says \u201cObama is doing the job of 3 men: Larry, Moe and Curly.\u201d\n\nBut he wishes Virginia had expanded Medicaid.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve fallen through just about every crack there is,\u201d he said. \u201cAt one point, I couldn\u2019t afford my medications. I dropped down to 169 pounds and spent 17 days in the hospital. But maybe that Medicaid expansion could\u2019ve helped me, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nHis former state senator, Philip Puckett (D-Russell), had been one of the Virginia Democrats in favor of expanding Medicaid. The legislature was deadlocked, and the debate was continuing. Then, out of the blue, Puckett resigned at a time when Republicans had arranged jobs for him and his daughter.\n\nHis betrayal handed Republicans the majority and stalled the effort to get more people insured. It also sparked an investigation by the feds.\n\nPuckett\u2019s name came up a lot in those tents, which are pitched just a few miles from his district.\n\n\u201cNow gimme a minute, I\u2019m going to censor myself here,\u201d Deborah Nagy, 60, explained as she prepared to tell me what she thought about her former senator.\n\n\u201cHe was a downright polecat,\u201d she said. \u201cTalk about being let down.\u201d\n\nNagy is one of about 21,000 in Puckett\u2019s former district who don\u2019t have insurance. She is a home health-care aide who makes too much for Medicaid and too little to pay for insurance herself through the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m another one who fell through the cracks,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe if that expansion passed, I wouldn\u2019t have to be here today.\u201d\n\nBy noon, the folks who got in line Thursday were being examined after a 26-hour wait. Eyes were being dilated, blood drawn and teeth pulled.\n\nA politician showed up and started shaking hands with the soggy people huddled under a huge, yellow-and-white striped tent, waiting to have their eyes checked. He told them: \u201cI am working to make sure you get health care all year, not just one day a year.\u201d\n\nFrom the back row, Gilda Mountcastle, 54, a house cleaner from Keokee in Lee County, shouted: \u201cWe know Jesus. And we know Stan Brock. Who are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the governor,\u201d Terry McAuliffe said.\n\nMountcastle later told me that she knew he was the governor \u2014 she was trying to put him on the spot. She demanded to know how he is going to fix the state of health care in Virginia.\n\n\u201cWe are proud, hillbilly mountain folk,\u201d Mountcastle said. \u201cWe want to work hard. We don\u2019t want handouts or food stamps. But we want to be able to afford to take care of ourselves and our family.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to close the coverage gap,\u201d McAuliffe said, explaining that many of the folks at the fairgrounds this weekend are the very people who would have been helped by Medicaid expansion. He called it \u201cthe moral, social and financially responsible thing to do.\u201d\n\nTo stand in line for 30 hours to get medical care one day a year \u201cis not how you do health care in this country,\u201d he said.\n\nYou\u2019ve got that right. The tents, the livestock corral, the desperate, broken bodies. It is a shameful that Virginia has allowed partisanship and politics to stand in the way of caring for its people.\n\npetula.dvorak@washpost.com\n\nTwitter: @petulad\n\nFor previous columns, go to washingtonpost.com/dvorak.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Virginia lawmakers could have expanded Medicaid.
