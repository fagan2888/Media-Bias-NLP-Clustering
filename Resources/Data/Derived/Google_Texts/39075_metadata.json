Rick Perry discussed exclusively with Breitbart News his plan to get Americans back to work amid a crisis with the lowest workforce participation rate since 1979.\n\nWhile casually hemming his own dress slacks for Thursday\u2019s debate in his hotel suite at the Renaissance Hotel in downtown Cleveland, Perry\u2014who wore a Chris Kyle Foundation t-shirt and windbreaker workout pants\u2014walked through how, as governor of Texas, he created more jobs than any other candidate for the Republican nomination in 2016.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nDuring Perry\u2019s time as Texas\u2019 Governor, he created more jobs than any other state governors, and in fact, created 1.5 million jobs in Texas during the 2008 recession while the nation as a whole lost 400,000 jobs.\n\n\u201cFreedom from over taxation and freedom from over regulation will work everywhere \u2013 this is not Texas centric,\u201d Perry explained to Breitbart News. \u201cA president who is committed to devolving power out of Washington, D.C. and back to the states, I think, is a breath of fresh air.\u201d\n\nPerry went on to discuss education and healthcare, saying those issues, when left to the states, save money without losing quality. \u201cStates need to make the decisions on curriculum for their public schools, for their healthcare decisions for their citizens, for their transportation infrastructure \u2013 all of those today are centralized in Washington, DC or substantially centralized in Washington D.C.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the reason I\u2019m against Common Core,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s the reason I\u2019m against Obamacare.\u201d\n\nPerry\u2013who won\u2019t be on the main debate stage on Thursday evening but will be center-stage in the undercard debate, providing him a unique opportunity to dominate that stage\u2013said that bringing that Tenth Amendment mentality to Washington, D.C. as president and bringing men and women who are committed to that mentality to serve in his cabinet would cause a trickle-down effect.\n\n\u201cThey hire people downward through those agencies\u2013for instance, a Health and Human Service Secretary who then had men and women down through that agency that were committed to devolving power back to the states, devolving dollars back to the states\u2026 let the states come up with solutions,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey will deliver better results for less money \u2013 we know that. I\u2019m not sure there has been a president in the last 30 years, with the notable exception of Ronald Reagan, that really believed in devolving power back to the United States,\u201d Perry said.\n\nHe added that Clinton didn\u2019t and, at the same time, separated him from the last former Governor of Texas that served as president.\n\n\u201cGeorge W. Bush had No Child Left Behind \u2013 we didn\u2019t participate with No Child Left Behind because we would have had to lower our standards.\u201d\n\nPerry went on to address Medicare and said that the entitlement program is another example where the states should have control.\n\n\u201cYou can deliver better services, you can save money and, I suggest to you, when you couple that with Tort reform, you can make access to health care,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the great results that we had in Texas about healthcare and the access to health care, you know people want to criticize Texas for \u2013 \u2018you got high percentage of people uninsured\u2019 \u2014 and we say we don\u2019t judge success on how may people you force to buy insurance, we judge success on how any people have access to quality health care,\u201d Perry said. \u201cAnd since 2003 when we put the most sweeping Tort reform in the nation in place \u2014 in that decade, we have had amazing expansion of access to healthcare.\u201d\n\nPerry gave an example of a nonprofit Christian hospital in Corpus Christie, Texas \u2013 Christian Spohn Hospital \u2014 that is able to save an incredible amount of money each year and then, as a result, reinvest the money for better healthcare and better services.\n\n\u201cThey save over a hundred million dollars every year on defense costs. That money goes back into hiring doctors, hiring nurses, hiring technicians, buying technology, buying buildings \u2013 a hundred million dollars a year \u2013 every year,\u201d he touted. \u201cMy point with using Texas \u2013 the 12th largest economy in the world \u2013 as an example, I think carries weight,\u201d Perry continued, \u201cUnlike the capable men and women who are going to be sharing the stage with us tomorrow, they\u2019re all going to be saying the right thing \u2013 but how many of them have done the right thing?\u201d\n\nPerry went on to stress the importance for the next president to have experience running a government.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important for the American people to decide whether they \u2014 after what will be eight years of a young, inexperienced United States Senator who in, arguably from my opinion, has put us in worse economic shape than where we should be and certainly from a foreign policy stand point in a weaker position all around the globe \u2014 are ready for someone who has the results of having been a major executive and there is not anyone on the stage that has been an executive of anything bigger than the 12th largest economy in the world \u2013 and the results to go with it.\u201d\n\nWithout Perry\u2019s record of job creation, the nation would have been in even worse shape during the recession following 2008, as he created 1.5 million jobs in Texas while the rest of the states were losing jobs left and right \u2013 all together, a net loss of 400,000 jobs.\n\n\u201cThe most important perspective is that the bulk of that occurred during the worse economic time in America since the Great Depression and then the Great Recession\u2026 Texas added 1.5 million jobs while the country lost 400,000 jobs collectively,\u201d he told Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a stunning juxtaposition that one state created 1.5 million jobs. The detractors will say, \u2018it\u2019s because you\u2019re in the oil and gas business\u2019 \u2013 we\u2019re still creating jobs and it is 50 percent of what it was a year ago,\u201d Perry fired back.\n\nPerry added that Texas has a diverse economy \u2013 not just focused on oil and gas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re also the number one high tech exporting state in the nation. Facebook , eBay, every one of these (points at an Apple laptop) is manufactured in Austin, Texas,\u201d Perry said of his home state capital.\n\n\u201cWe are a massively diversified economy. Yes, we got an oil and gas industry because we chose to develop that industry, we chose to put policies into place to use that to help create jobs and wealth \u2013 which we did \u2013 but the bulk of the Texas economy is from other areas.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Perry explained the oil and gas industry is half of what it was in 1985.\n\n\u201cA president who is committed to freeing people from over taxation, from over regulation\u201d is how to get this country back to work, he said, adding that motivating people into the workforce is tied to North American energy policy.\n\n\u201cCanada, the United States and Mexico have more known energy reserves than Saudi Arabia and Russia, that\u2019s how much energy we have,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis president\u2019s decision on the XL pipeline, this president\u2019s decision on coal, this decision on Solyndra have all been very negative for America\u2019s future, we can drive down the cost of electricity, and this is not theory \u2013 because we did it in my own state\u2026 electricity prices went down 40 percent \u2013 it happened because we deregulated the industry and let it compete.\u201d\n\nPerry explained that driving down the cost of energy, coupled with lowering the corporate tax rate, is the way to put Americans back to work and America back in business.\n\n\u201cAny conservative economist will tell you that if you lower the corporate tax rate 10 percent, you will have a corresponding increase in midlevel wages by 5 to 10 percent. So every blue-collar worker ought to be saying, \u2018Perry, we\u2019re voting for you because you\u2019re going to help raise our salaries, help raise our hourly wage,\u2019 and the other incentive of that is to manufacturers who have gone offshore \u2013 they\u2019ll come back.\u201d\n\nPerry said the nonparticipation rate in the workforce is the highest it has been since 1979 \u2013 roughly at 63 percent. He believes energy is the key to getting people back to participating instead of being dependent on the government.\n\n\u201cAffordable energy \u2014 you have a work force that is willing and working, then you can have the greatest renaissance in manufacturing history \u2013 that\u2019s how you get this country back.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou give them the incentive of having a good job and right now, I don\u2019t think they have that incentive. You see an economy that\u2019s only growing at best at two percent and so we are giving people more incentives to stay off of work than we are go to work,\u201d Perry added.\n\nPerry hinted that he would share a large economic plan later in his campaign that will help America visualize what a President Perry could do for workers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to lay out a really visionary approach to getting people back to work and some of the ideas we are going to lay out, but at it\u2019s core it\u2019s about creating an environment where the job creators know they can risk their capital and they\u2019ll go out and make the incentives to the workforce out there. They\u2019ll offer the salaries to get people to come back into the work force, but they\u2019re not going to do it if they\u2019re over taxed and over regulated and that\u2019s what they see today.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the entrepreneur is afraid to invest in this country today either because of the unpredictability of the regulatory climate or the cost of doing business \u2013 high energy cost, high transportation cost \u2013 so using North American energy for the basis of the renaissance of manufacturing is the key to the future of this country and to this region for that matter,\u201d Perry concluded, saying his plan will create a very energy secure region.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rick Perry discussed his plan to get Americans back to work amid a crisis with the lowest workforce participation rate since 1979.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Rick Perry discussed his plan to get Americans back to work amid a crisis with the lowest workforce participation rate since 1979.", "title": "Exclusive: Rick Perry Details Plan to Save American Workers", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 3486, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/ap_rick-perry_ap-photo3-e1438819950610.jpg", "height": 2527}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/05/exclusive-rick-perry-details-plan-to-save-american-workers-every-blue-collar-worker-should-be-voting-for-me/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rick Perry discussed his plan to get Americans back to work amid a crisis with the lowest workforce participation rate since 1979.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/07/ap_rick-perry_ap-photo3-e1438819950610.jpg", "title": "Exclusive: Rick Perry Details Plan to Save American Workers", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Energy Prices, manufacturing, Rick Perry, texas economy, Texas Jobs, unemployment,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Economics,rick perry", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "unemployment", "published_time": "2015-08-05T17:13:46-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdae4c\"", "article_summary": "Perry hinted that he would share a large economic plan later in his campaign that will help America visualize what a President Perry could do for workers.\nFacebook , eBay, every one of these (points at an Apple laptop) is manufactured in Austin, Texas,\u201d Perry said of his home state capital.\nYou see an economy that\u2019s only growing at best at two percent and so we are giving people more incentives to stay off of work than we are go to work,\u201d Perry added.\n\u201cFreedom from over taxation and freedom from over regulation will work everywhere \u2013 this is not Texas centric,\u201d Perry explained to Breitbart News.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a stunning juxtaposition that one state created 1.5 million jobs."}
