After all, these are the folks who won't even disclose what coffee the president drinks. From going after whistleblowers to restricting reporter access to obfuscating his foreign policy, Obama is about as open as the front door of the White House.\n\nTooting the Whistleblowing Horn\n\nColumbia Journalism Review writes that \"the Obama administration has prosecuted more people as whistleblowers under the 1917 Espionage Act than all former presidents combined.\" Journalism heavyweights Leonard Downie Jr. and James Goodale have been some of the loudest in warning about the current administration's heavy-handedness towards reporters and their sources. Goodale describes the president's stance on press freedom as \"antediluvian, conservative, backwards. Worse than Nixon. He thinks that anyone who leaks is a spy!\"\n\nPhone records of an A.P. journalist have been seized, a Fox News reporter was specifically targeted, and other journalists have faced intimidation from the government for their reporting. Nor are sources of government information safe: last year the Obama administration launched an \"Insider Threat\" program in response to the Edward Snowden leaks. The program encourages government employees to snitch on colleagues suspected of leaking information.\n\nGiving Reporters the Run-Around\n\nBut even run-of-the-mill reporters are having an increasingly difficult time as the Obama administration tightens its grip on information access. Diluting and filtering what information is released and how it is presented has become the modus operandi for the administration. Journalists are being shut out of meetings normally open to the press. The administration has also clamped down on photography of the president and official events. The restrictive policy has been described as \"Orwellian\" and White House chief photographer Pete Souza has been called a \"propagandist.\" Veteran New York Times political correspondent David Sanger said that \"this is the most closed, control-freak administration I've ever covered.\"\n\nBush by Any Other Name\n\nBut nowhere is this restriction of information more apparent than with respect to the administration's foreign affairs and national security policies. Access to photos and information about the ISIS engagement is tightly controlled. Despite promises of transparency, the Department of Homeland Security's no-fly list continues to operate in the dark. The administration is also notoriously reluctant in disclosing information on the ongoing drone program in the Middle East\u2014although it loves bragging about its accomplishments in a program that didn't until recently officially exist. FOIA requests are consistently denied or ignored\u2014apparently often enough to justify an \"FOIA Denial Officer.\" Even the government's use of torture\u2014that quintessentially Bush-era bugbear\u2014falls under the administration's cone of silence.\n\nSometimes it seems like the only thing we do know about the administration is that it will continue eloquently praising its own unprecedented transparency. We would do well to put pressure on Obama to make good on his promises. Or at the very least point out to him that \"least\" is not spelled m-o-s-t.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Seeking to assuage concerns about the administration's record of opacity, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest unctuously&nbsp;assured the Society", "title": "The Most Transparent Administration\u2122 Keeps Bragging, Concealing", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2014/09/26/three-signs-of-the-obama-administrations", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_09/well-it-all-depends-on-what-yo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/mc/_external/2014_09/well-it-all-depends-on-what-yo.jpg", "description": "Seeking to assuage concerns about the administration's record of\nopacity, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest\nunctuously&nbsp;assured\nthe Society of Professional Journalists last month that Obama is\ntransparent because he is transparent:\n\nThe president has set an historically high standard of\ntransparency that is part of the legacy", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Most Transparent Administration\u2122 Keeps Bragging, Concealing"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Foreign Policy", "published_time": "2014-09-26T14:33:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/lucian-mcmahon"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0ecd\"", "article_summary": "Tooting the Whistleblowing HornColumbia Journalism Review writes that \"the Obama administration has prosecuted more people as whistleblowers under the 1917 Espionage Act than all former presidents combined.\"\nSo what is the actual transparency record for the Obama administration?\nGiving Reporters the Run-AroundBut even run-of-the-mill reporters are having an increasingly difficult time as the Obama administration tightens its grip on information access.\nNor are sources of government information safe: last year the Obama administration launched an \"Insider Threat\" program in response to the Edward Snowden leaks.\nDiluting and filtering what information is released and how it is presented has become the modus operandi for the administration."}
