Katty Kay and Claire Shipman hardly seem like victims of self-doubt. Between them, they have covered the Clinton White House and the fall of the Soviet Union (Ms. Shipman), anchors BBC World News America (Ms. Kay) and learned to kiteboard at nearly 40 (Ms. Kay again). And yet both say they have had to work to overcome fears of inadequacy, tendencies to defer to male colleagues and “tortured cycles of useless self-recrimination.” In “The Confidence Code,” to be published on Tuesday, they lay out a path for women to become more self-assured. In phone conversations and at a lunch date (served by Sidra Forman, a Washington chef), Ms. Kay and Ms. Shipman discussed how to swat away creeping negative thoughts and what they are really thinking when they’re on television. (This interview has been edited and condensed.)

Q. LET’S START WITH A STRATEGIC QUESTION: IF YOU’RE ASKED SOMETHING ON TELEVISION, AND YOU’RE NOT SURE OF THE ANSWER, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

KK: Television is an X-ray. If you try to be something you’re not, television will pick it up.

ARE YOU COMFORTABLE SAYING “I DON’T KNOW”?

KK: I have become comfortable.

CS: Early on, when I started, I certainly did not feel comfortable with that. When I started to cover the White House, I felt I had to know everything, and you do to some extent. They’ll ask you about foreign policy, the budget. You’re a woman, a perfectionist, and you want to get everything right. Over time, you learn that it’s O.K. to say, “We’re still waiting on that.”

DO EITHER OF YOU STILL GET NERVOUS ON AIR?

KK: Some shows, yes. I still get nervous on “Meet the Press.” Maybe it’s the big set. And I’m the only woman.

PLUS, IN THE BOOK, YOU CONVINCINGLY DEMONSTRATE THERE’S A PENALTY FOR WOMEN WHO TALK TOO MUCH. ON TELEVISION, IS IT BETTER TO PICK YOUR MOMENTS OR JUMP IN WHENEVER YOU WANT?

CS: The penalty for talking too much is a corporate statistic. I’m not sure it’s true on television. You’re always given the thumbs-up for talking. I’ve done a lot of the Sunday shows, been on a lot of panels with men. I’ve noticed a pattern of saying what I felt I was qualified to say and stopping, and then I’d notice that the men would just go on and on and on about things that they shouldn’t have been talking about. It wasn’t what was asked, it was taking the conversation in an entirely different direction. And I’d think, wow. At one point I’d look at transcripts and I’d have talked half as much.
