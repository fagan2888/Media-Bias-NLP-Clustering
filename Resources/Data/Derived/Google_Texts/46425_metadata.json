Paul LePage went after Democrat Mike Michaud for voting with his party 97 percent of the time while in Congress.\n\nAdditional Images His rivals listen as Democrat Mike Michaud, right, answers a question about his voting record on women\u2019s reproductive rights Wednesday during the gubernatorial debate.

REMAINING DEBATES OCT. 20: 7 p.m., Hannaford Hall, University of Southern Maine, Portland, sponsored by WGME-TV and the Bangor Daily News OCT. 21: 7 p.m., Channel 8 studios, 99 Danforth Road, Auburn, sponsored by WMTW-TV and WABI-TV Related Headlines Debate Fact Check: Medicaid, gun, Ebola claims miss the mark Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192\n\nMichaud criticized the incumbent for his refusal to expand Medicaid to more low-income Mainers.\n\nAnd independent Eliot Cutler chastised both men \u2013 Michaud for his late evolution on reproductive rights and LePage for brokering a bad deal with Cate Street Capital, which couldn\u2019t save Great Northern Paper Co. and its Millinocket area mills from bankruptcy.\n\nWednesday was the third debate featuring all three candidates, but it was the first held in prime time and the first to be broadcast live statewide on television, via WCSH-6 in Portland and WLBZ-2 in Bangor.\n\nPat Callaghan, a longtime anchor with WCSH-6, served as moderator and worked diligently to keep the debate on track and moving.\n\nUnlike two morning debates last week, Wednesday\u2019s event featured significantly more give and take among the candidates.\n\nAt one point, Callaghan gave them a chance to ask one opponent a question.\n\nLePage\u2019s question was to both Michaud and Cutler and had to do with reports that the Democratic Party first approached Cutler to be its nominee.\n\n\u201cIs that true?\u201d LePage asked Cutler.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Cutler replied.\n\nLePage, turning to Michaud, then asked, \u201cHow do you feel about that?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m the Democratic nominee,\u201d Michaud said. \u201cThey chose me.\u201d\n\nThe debate, held at the Augusta Civic Center during the Maine State Chamber of Commerce\u2019s annual dinner and awards ceremony, remained civil but featured a number of testy exchanges.\n\nEarly in the program, Callaghan asked Michaud why he refuses to acknowledge Cutler in the race. Michaud, in his answer, avoided acknowledging the independent, prompting Callaghan to press.\n\n\u201cI have experience, he doesn\u2019t have a voting record,\u201d Michaud finally said of Cutler before quickly shifting his focus back to LePage.\n\nWhen it was Cutler\u2019s turn to speak, he told Michaud, \u201cI\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have your voting record,\u201d which prompted LePage to exclaim, \u201cMe, too,\u201d and clap his hands.\n\nMichaud told the crowd at the outset, \u201cI\u2019m not the most entertaining orator. I\u2019m more of a listener and a problem solver.\u201d\n\nBut the Democrat was forced to respond often because he was besieged by both LePage and Cutler.\n\nResponding to criticism that he cast a number of votes earlier in his career against equal rights for gays and lesbians and against reproductive rights, Michaud acknowledged that he has indeed changed his position since he first was elected as a 24-year-old state representative.\n\n\u201cYes, I have evolved, but what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d he said.\n\nCutler didn\u2019t relent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad Mike has evolved, but he\u2019s not being honest. He cast those votes when he was 24, 34, 44, and even 54. It took him 30 years (to evolve),\u201d he said, turning to Michaud. \u201cYou had to go to Washington to find out you were wrong?\u201d\n\nThe candidates continued the ongoing debate about expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, something LePage has vehemently opposed and Michaud and Cutler have supported.\n\nCutler said Maine\u2019s hospitals want the expansion \u2013 the same hospitals that were owed state Medicaid reimbursements that LePage paid off by leveraging future liquor sales. He pointed out that those same hospitals are now back in the red, and \u201cyou don\u2019t have another liquor business to sell.\u201d\n\nLePage said expansion will not help as many people as the Democrats have predicted and that the better option for low-income individuals is to purchase insurance from the federal exchange because they will get better care.\n\nThere were several back-and-forth exchanges in which one candidate sought to correct a point made by another. In some cases, it was difficult to keep up with the many numbers and claims being made.\n\nThe audience of about 600 business leaders was mostly subdued, although there were a few laughable moments.\n\nEarly in the debate, as Michaud and LePage argued a point, Cutler jumped in and said, \u201cDo you really want four or eight more years of this? Really?\u201d\n\nLater in the debate, the candidates were asked what their top priority would be for creating jobs. The answers differed greatly.\n\n\u201cThe No. 1 priority, energy. No. 2, right to work,\u201d said LePage, referring to legislation that would weaken unions by making dues optional.\n\nMichaud said his No. 1 priority would be to \u201cfire Gov. LePage.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the biggest detriment to small-business growth,\u201d Michaud said.\n\nCutler said his top priority, \u201cwithout question, is education.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want every kid in the state to be trained and educated so that he or she can have a job, or can take a job in a new or expanding business. We\u2019re not doing enough today,\u201d he said.\n\nA lightning round of questions just before the candidates\u2019 closing statements offered another glimpse of the differences between the three.\n\nOn legalizing marijuana, Cutler said he could see it happening but was not ready to support it. LePage said he would support it, but only through a referendum. Michaud said he has concerns, but did not elaborate.\n\nAsked whether they would support mandatory sick time for employees, LePage said no, Michaud said yes and Cutler said only as part of an insurance plan.\n\nOn universal background checks for gun sales, LePage said no and Michaud and Cutler both said yes.\n\nOn whether Maine should pursue nuclear energy, Michaud and Cutler said no, while LePage said yes.\n\nIn a lighter moment, each candidate was asked whom he would vote for, after himself, if Maine had ranked-choice voting.\n\nNone of the candidates answered directly.\n\nMichaud said, \u201cThank God we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nSaid Cutler, \u201cI\u2019d leave it blank.\u201d\n\nAnd LePage said, \u201cMy wife.\u201d\n\nIn closing statements, the three made one final pitch to the chamber audience and those watching at home.\n\nCutler stressed his independence and the quality of his ideas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m offering you a better way,\u201d he said. \u201cNot left, not right, but forward.\u201d\n\nLePage said the election offers voters a clear choice between \u201ctwo liberals and one conservative.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe can go backward or continue to go forward and reinvent tomorrow,\u201d he said.\n\nMichaud also sought to offer voters a clear choice: \u201cThe same divisive partisanship of our current governor,\u201d he said. \u201cOr you have a choice to move Maine forward in a positive way focusing on our strengths.\u201d\n\nThe candidates are scheduled to participate in two more debates, on Monday and Tuesday. Both will be televised.\n\nEric Russell can be contacted at 791-6344 or at:\n\n[email protected]\n\nTwitter: @PPHEricRussell", "article_metadata": {"description": "The first prime-time, statewide face-off of the campaign features testy but civil exchanges over the candidates' records and positions on issues.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "The first prime-time, statewide face-off of the campaign features testy but civil exchanges over the candidates' records and positions on issues.", "title": "Third gubernatorial debate: Rivals intensify attacks before the TV cameras - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 999, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/334177_263830-20141015_debate_001.jpg", "height": 510}, "updated_time": "2014-10-16T12:16:28-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2014/10/15/stage-set-for-first-televised-debate-of-maine-governors-race/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/334177_263830-20141015_debate_001.jpg", "description": "The first prime-time, statewide face-off of the campaign features testy but civil exchanges over the candidates' records and positions on issues.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Third gubernatorial debate: Rivals intensify attacks before the TV cameras - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Local & State", "published_time": "2014-10-15T15:47:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-16T12:16:28-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd048\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIs that true?\u201d LePage asked Cutler.\nEarly in the program, Callaghan asked Michaud why he refuses to acknowledge Cutler in the race.\nAdditional Images His rivals listen as Democrat Mike Michaud, right, answers a question about his voting record on women\u2019s reproductive rights Wednesday during the gubernatorial debate.\nReally?\u201dLater in the debate, the candidates were asked what their top priority would be for creating jobs.\nPat Callaghan, a longtime anchor with WCSH-6, served as moderator and worked diligently to keep the debate on track and moving."}
