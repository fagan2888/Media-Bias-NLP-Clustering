Though there are challenges for all of these students to overcome on the road to becoming an MD, students with disabilities face many unique obstacles.\n\nAccording to a new study, only a third of schools said outright that they would accept a qualified student with a disability, and another had offered only \u201cvague\u201d information about who they would accept. The researchers found that even if schools would consider an application from students with disabilities and offer them assistance as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act, students couldn\u2019t easily deduce that information from the school\u2019s website.\n\nAbout 42 percent of medical school websites were ranked as difficult when it came to finding information for prospective students with disabilities, and impossible on 16 percent. Even when the researchers posed as prospective students and asked for information, twelve schools still didn\u2019t respond. They write the findings suggest a \u201cconcerning state of affairs as we celebrate the ADA\u2019s 25th anniversary.\"\n\nThe authors also note that admitting more disabled students to medical school could enhance not only their lives, but the nation\u2019s commitment to serve people with disabilities, since physicians with disabilities are more likely to serve patients like themselves.\n\n\u201cIn addition to the benefit to students themselves, and to the patients they will one day treat, including students with disabilities in a medical school class can educate the students without disabilities about the issues people with disabilities face,\u201d said lead author Dr. Philip Zazove, chair of the Department of Family Medicine at University of Michigan Medical School, in a press release.\n\nThe study is the first of its kind, and suggests that medical schools need to update, clarify, or post their technical standards, or TSs. TSs are required under the ADA, and explain what a school will do to accommodate students with disabilities. An example would be allowing the use of technology to overcome limitation, like a student with a hearing limitation using an amplified stethoscope.\n\nSchools are prohibited from discriminating against people with disabilities under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. If a school accepts federal funds, they are required to make \u201creasonable\u201d efforts to accommodate qualified disabled applicants. According to senior study author Dr. Michael D. Fetters, however, there is currently explicit language in the policies on medical school websites that is not in compliance with the ADA.\n\n\u201cIn this day and age when public institutions are expected to conform with the law, this is almost unimaginable,\u201d Fetters, who is also a professor of family medicine, said. \u201cIf you\u2019re an applicant who\u2019s online, and it says you\u2019re not welcome, you\u2019re going to accept that and never get out of the gate. Even if the school would be willing to accommodate you if you apply and qualify, the explicit language is at least a serious deterrent.\u201d\n\nZazove himself is deaf and uses a cochlear implant, and mentors U-M medical students and residents who have disabilities. In addition to him, U-M has another department chair and other faculty with disabilities, and a handful of current medical students have disabilities and are being accommodated at the school. The institution is always looking to do better, though, according to Dr. Joseph Kolars, senior associate dean for education and global initiatives.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the attention our colleagues have brought to an important issue that deserves more attention,\u201d he said. \u201cLike most medical schools, we recognize opportunities for ours to do even better in regard to better articulating our values and making sure all of our communications are in alignment. This will make a good school even better and hopefully others will recognize similar opportunities as well.\u201d\n\nSource: Zazove P, Case B, Moreland C, Plegue M, Hoekstra A, Ouellette A, et al.
