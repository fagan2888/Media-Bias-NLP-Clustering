It started with the letter from his health-insurance company informing him it was canceling his plan and offering him a new one that\u2019s nearly twice as expensive. Then the 60-year-old retiree from Mount Vernon heard about more people like himself with canceled plans and soaring premiums. Finally, he spent hours on the phone and computer trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to find a new option that he likes. \u201cThis whole experience has converted a lifelong Democrat into a foot soldier for the Republican Party,\u201d Fullner said. He\u2019s not alone in his frustration. In Washington, most of the 290,000 people covered by insurance plans they purchased on the individual market received letters this fall telling them that their plans are going away\u2026That\u2019s left Fuller and many others feeling blindsided. They \u2014 and Republican leaders opposed to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 are now calling a pledge made by President Obama as he lobbied for the law a betrayal. \u201cObama stated that if we were happy with an insurance plan that we currently had, we would be able to keep it,\u201d Fullner said in an email. \u201cI feel that the president, who I greatly admired and supported, has lied to the public.\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2019s not done lying, either:\n\nObama adds a clause to \u201cyou can keep it\u201d \u2013 \u201cWhat we said was you can keep it if it hasn\u2019t changed since the law passed.\u201d \u2014 Reid J. Epstein (@reidepstein) November 4, 2013\n\nFlat. Out. Lie. Although galvanizing new Republican converts clearly was not one of the White House\u2019s goals in foisting Obamacare upon the country, dropped coverage and rising costs for many actually were. Team O couldn\u2019t say that out loud, of course, but without those intended consequences in full swing, the law collapses. That\u2019s reality. Meanwhile, back in Fantasy Land\u2026\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is we are making the insurance market better for everybody,\u201d says Pres. Obama. \u2014 Mark Knoller (@markknoller) November 4, 2013\n\nAgain, demonstrably false, on both an empirical and anecdotal level \u2014 with more pain on the way for a lot more people. By all means, keep talkin\u2019, champ.\n\nUPDATE \u2013 See? Everyone\u2019s better off!\n\nExpecting parents being forced into new health plan now have a deductible 3Xs the amt of old, $10,000 #mycancellation pic.twitter.com/rlzoIptz1H \u2014 My Cancellation (@MyCancellation) November 4, 2013\n\nRecently in the Green Room:", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cThis whole experience has converted a lifelong Democrat into a foot soldier for the Republican Party\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Greenroom", "description": "Hey look, a not terrible unintended consequence of Obamacare: Bill Fullner has reached his breaking point.\u00a0It started with the letter from his health-insurance company informing him it was cancelin\u2026", "title": "\u201cThis whole experience has converted a lifelong Democrat into a foot soldier for the Republican Party\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2013/11/05/this-whole-experience-has-converted-a-lifelong-democrat-into-a-foot-soldier-for-the-republican-party/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-05T16:21:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-05T00:02:30+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde916\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThis whole experience has converted a lifelong Democrat into a foot soldier for the Republican Party,\u201d Fullner said.\n\u201cThis whole experience has converted a lifelong Democrat into a foot soldier for the Republican Party\u201dposted at 11:21 am on November 5, 2013 by Guy BensonHey look, a not terrible unintended consequence of Obamacare:Bill Fullner has reached his breaking point.\nThey \u2014 and Republican leaders opposed to the Affordable Care Act \u2014 are now calling a pledge made by President Obama as he lobbied for the law a betrayal.\nThen the 60-year-old retiree from Mount Vernon heard about more people like himself with canceled plans and soaring premiums.\nIn Washington, most of the 290,000 people covered by insurance plans they purchased on the individual market received letters this fall telling them that their plans are going away\u2026That\u2019s left Fuller and many others feeling blindsided."}
