A financial bubble,\" the billionaire businessman said in an interview with The Washington Post published on Saturday.\n\nComing off a tough week on the campaign trail in which he made a series of missteps, Trump's latest comments bring him back into the limelight ahead of Tuesday's important primary in Wisconsin where he trails in the polls.\n\nThe former reality TV star said that the real U.S. jobless figure is much higher than five percent number released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\"We\u2019re not at 5 percent unemployment,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We\u2019re at a number that\u2019s probably into the twenties if you look at the real number,\u201d he said, adding that the official jobless figure is \"statistically devised to make politicians \u2014 and in particular presidents \u2014 look good.\"\n\nTrump said \u201cit\u2019s a terrible time right now\u201d to invest in the stock market, offering a more bleak view of the U.S. economy than that held by many mainstream economists.\n\nThe interview was bylined by the Post's Robert Costa and famed Watergate reporter Bob Woodward.\n\nA real estate magnate, Trump has made appealing to blue-collar workers a hallmark of his bid for the Republican nomination for the Nov. 8 presidential election, often blaming unemployment on the outsourcing of U.S. jobs and facilities to countries such as China and Mexico.\n\nTrump vowed in the interview to wipe out the more than $19 trillion national debt \"over a period of eight years,\" helped by a renegotiation of trade deals.\n\n\"I\u2019m renegotiating all of our deals, the big trade deals that we\u2019re doing so badly on,\" he said.\n\nNATO AGAIN\n\nAfter making controversial statements about abortion last week, Trump has shown little sign of heeding calls from fellow Republicans to adopt a more presidential tone so as to avoid alienating voters in the November general election if he wins the nomination.\n\nOn Saturday, he questioned close U. S. ties to Saudi Arabia and again accused U.S. allies of not pulling their weight in the NATO military alliance.\n\nTrump told a campaign rally in Racine, Wisconsin that partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \"are not paying their fair share\" and called the 28-nation alliance \"obsolete.\"\n\n\"Either they pay up, including for past deficiencies, or they have to get out. And if it breaks up NATO, it breaks up NATO,\" Trump said.\n\nTuesday's Wisconsin nominating contest could be a turning point in the Republican race. Trump, 69, trails his leading rival, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz, 45, of Texas in the state.\n\nA Cruz win would make it harder for Trump to reach the number of 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination before the Republican national convention in July. The winner will get to claim all of Wisconsin's 42 delegates.\n\n(Writing by Alana Wise; Editing by James Dalgleish; and Alistair Bell)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump predicted that", "title": "Trump predicts 'very massive recession' in U.S.", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/02/Trump-again-slams-NATO-allies-despite-Obama-plea", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/04/02/Trump-again-slams-NATO-allies-despite-Obama-plea", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-trump_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump predicted that", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5b52\"", "article_summary": "And if it breaks up NATO, it breaks up NATO,\" Trump said.\n\"We\u2019re not at 5 percent unemployment,\" Trump said.\nMILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump predicted that the United States is on course for a \"very massive recession,\" warning that a combination of high unemployment and an overvalued stock market had set the stage for another economic slump.\nA Cruz win would make it harder for Trump to reach the number of 1,237 delegates needed to secure the nomination before the Republican national convention in July.\n\"We\u2019re at a number that\u2019s probably into the twenties if you look at the real number,\u201d he said, adding that the official jobless figure is \"statistically devised to make politicians \u2014 and in particular presidents \u2014 look good.\""}
