Fred Upton (R-MI). Some 39 Democrats joined all Republicans in voting yes just a day after Barack Obama announced his own unilateral and illegal \u201cfix\u201d for his ailing law.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal summarized Upton\u2019s bill:\u201cThe one-page bill would allow insurers to continue offering for sale in 2014 the policies that ObamaCare terminated, exempting them from federal regulatory edicts.\u201d However, because insurance companies have spent the last three and a half years working to comply with ObamaCare regulations, Upton\u2019s bill is unlikely to actually save many plans. Such is the nature of Obama\u2019s \u201cyou can keep your plan\u201d lie.\n\nBy contrast, Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA) offered her own version of a \u201ckeep your plan\u201d bill in the Senate. In this case, the Journal writes, Landrieu\u2019s bill \u201cwould order insurers to continue to offer the dumped plans that in many cases no longer exist. This is also a substantive due process violation for business and unconstitutional commandeering of state regulators.\u201d That would be par for the course.\n\nUnfortunately, but predictably, the House vote didn\u2019t come close to a veto-proof majority as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) did the necessary nagging to prevent a caucus-wide jackass stampede. Furthermore, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) vowed that he won\u2019t take up the House bill. Either way, Obama would never let Congress compromise his legacy when he can come to the rescue himself.\n\nBut the House vote does indicate that, thanks to the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare, at least 39 Democrats are in near-total panic over their election prospects in 2014. Nearly all of them barely won their 2012 elections, and many are in Republican-leaning districts. Their short-sighted scrambling is quite a shift from 2010, when Democrats gleefully used their Washington hegemony to realize the 100-year-old progressive dream of \u201cuniversal\u201d health care. Recall that Democrats lost a near-record 63 seats in 2010 after passing the law.\n\nIt\u2019s also clear that ObamaCare will hang like an albatross around Democrats' necks. They\u2019ll never admit it \u2013 in fact, DNC chair Debbie Wassermann Schultz swears Democrats will run on ObamaCare next year \u2013 but they all know it\u2019s true.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House of Representatives voted 261-157 in favor of the \"Keep Your Health Plan Act.\" 39 panicked Democrats joined.", "csrf-token": "esyPjQ3uSPtW6TuLAee03B8rDuexqMgcpTen2YmR1RY=", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "og": {"site_name": "The Patriot Post", "description": "The House of Representatives voted 261-157 in favor of the \u201cKeep Your Health Plan Act.\u201d 39 panicked Democrats joined.", "title": "Democrats Panic Over ObamaCare", "url": "http://patriotpost.us/articles/21716", "image": "http://assets.patriotpost.us/images/2013-11-18-8012661c.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100002378661032, "app_id": 217327155053459}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca369\"", "article_summary": "But the House vote does indicate that, thanks to the disastrous rollout of ObamaCare, at least 39 Democrats are in near-total panic over their election prospects in 2014.\nGovernment & Politics Democrats Panic Over ObamaCareOn Friday, the House of Representatives voted 261-157 in favor of the \u201cKeep Your Health Plan Act,\u201d authored by Rep.
