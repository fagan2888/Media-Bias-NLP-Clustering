Phil Stratton said.\n\nDeputies described the slide area as unstable Sunday night, and they estimated an entire ridge had been sliding for most of the day. Heavy rain was believed to have contributed to the mudslide.\n\nRescue crews with the Plateau Valley Fire Department were on the scene.\n\nThe area is remote. No structures were reported damaged, but officials expected a more accurate assessment Monday morning. No major roads were affected.\n\nCellphone service is not available in the area.\n\nPeople are discouraged from going into the area, and a road block has been established outside the mudslide perimeter for safety. The roadblock is set up at the intersection of Colorado 330 and Salt Creek Road, outside Collbran.\n\nJoey Bunch: 303-954-1174, jbunch@denverpost.com or twitter.com/joeybunch", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Three missing in large Grand Mesa mudslide", "title": "Three missing in large Grand Mesa mudslide", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/25/three-missing-in-large-grand-mesa-mudslide/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140525__mudslide-areap1.jpg", "height": 398}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140525__mudslide-areap1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-25T21:13:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T18:41:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd213c\"", "article_summary": "Three people are missing on Grand Mesa in western Colorado, possibly swept away by mudslide estimated at 2 miles wide, 4 miles long and 250 feet deep Sunday evening, according to the Mesa County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\nDeputies described the slide area as unstable Sunday night, and they estimated an entire ridge had been sliding for most of the day.\nThe roadblock is set up at the intersection of Colorado 330 and Salt Creek Road, outside Collbran.\n\u201cThis slide is unbelievably big,\u201d Mesa County Lt.
