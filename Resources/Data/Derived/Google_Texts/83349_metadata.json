We talked yesterday about one grossly mistaken promise from President Obama: \u201cIf you like your [insurance] plan, you can keep your plan.\u201d\n\nBut that paled in comparison to then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\u2019s inadvertent admission. Referring to Obamacare, which was the size of multiple telephone books and whose contents were a mystery to most everyone, she famously said, \u201cWe have to pass the bill so you can find out what\u2019s in it.\u201d\n\nAs ObamaCare continues its rollout, we are finding out more and more about what exactly is in the \u201cAffordable Health Care Act.\u201d And the number and types of critics continues to grow.\n\nAlso on Wednesday\u2019s Jennifer Popik, JD, did an excellent job unspooling the truth behind the impact of t he massive ObamaCare tax on most health insurance plans (see \u201cObamacare tax on health insurance will affect most plans over time, reducing healthcare\u201d). Her post is very much worth reading.\n\nLess than 24 hours later we read this in today\u2019s Washington Post: \u201cFairfax utility: Obamacare will likely lead to dropped coverage.\u201d Fairfax is a city just south of Washington, DC, and the utility referred to is the Fairfax County Water Authority.\n\nTo her credit Post reporter Laura Vozzella pulls no punches and refuses to adopt the Obama administration line\u2014that health insurance policies that are not as parsimonious as ObamaCare wants can be derisively mischaracterized as \u201cCadillac\u201d plans.\n\nThe heart of the letter, written by Burton Jay Rubin, chairman of the authority\u2019s government relations committee, is that if the \u201cCadillac Tax\u201d takes place as planned in 2018 [a 40% excise tax on insurers], the authority \u201cwill likely drop insurance coverage for its nearly 400 employees,\u201d Vozzella writes.\n\n\u201c[I]t is irrefutable that the ACA is fatally flawed,\u201d wrote Rubin. \u201cIf it is intended to make health care coverage available to those who do not have it, it does so only by jeopardizing the coverage earned by those who have it.\u201d\n\nAs Ms. Popik explained yesterday, organized labor as well as larger (and smaller) businesses have great problems with this tax which starts in five years but then greatly increases over the following decade. The wrinkle in Vozzella\u2019s story is to have a \u201cquasi-public entity,\u201d like the Water Authority, \u201cweigh in.\u201d\n\nVozzella\u2019s account mirrors a key observation made by Ms. Popik. ObamaCare has a threshold after which the excise tax kicks in\u2014any plan \u201cthat cost companies more than $10,200 a year for individuals and $27,500 for families,\u201d Vozzella writes.\n\nBradley Herring, a health economist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, tells Vozzell that about 15% of insurance plans will hit that threshold in 2018. But by 2025, that figure will be about half \u201cbecause of rising medical costs. The law calls for the threshold to rise 2 percent a year \u2014 well below typical medical inflation, which the authority said is projected at 8 percent annually.\u201d\n\nRubin said that by 2018 the Fairfax County Water Authority expects to pay $13,450 to cover individual employees and $33,300 per employee family for coverage. \u201cThat would make the utility subject to enormous taxes \u2014 much higher than the tax it would pay if it provided no coverage at all,\u201d Vozzella explains. The logic is inescapable, as Rubin wrote: \u201c[I]f we provide our workforce with no health care coverage, we merely pay the Government $2,000 for each employee.\u201d\n\nPlease join those who are following me on Twitter at twitter.com/daveha.
