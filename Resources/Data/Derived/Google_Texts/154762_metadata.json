Some of the courts feature floors used at Freedom Hall.\n\nThe tournament is the largest of its kind in the United States and one of the largest wheelchair-based sporting events in the world, said Amy Lawicki, an NWBA organizer.\n\nAbout 40 teams competed in the event when it was held at the expo center last year, and the tournament will return to the venue next year, Lawicki said.\n\n\"It's a great central location,\" she said. \"We have a lot of teams east of the Mississippi River, so it's the perfect spot.\"\n\nThe NWBA includes more than 200 teams. Teams often travel \u2014 sometimes many hours away \u2014 and this weekend's tournament is the pinnacle of their sport in the United States.\n\nLarry Marks, a 16-year-old player for the Kady (Pa.) Komets, has been to Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and other states to play in tournaments.\n\n\"It takes a special kind of person to play this,\" Marks said, noting that the game is more physical than able-bodied basketball.\n\nThe tournament held a game to honor veterans Friday night. It harkened back to the association's beginning, when it was founded following World War II as a way to assist wounded veterans. Today, about 20 percent of the association's players are veterans.\n\n\"It's a fun sport to watch that's been growing,\" organizer Josie Owen said, adding that 39 states have teams.\n\nThe tournament continues Sunday with championship games for the adult and women's divisions.\n\nReporter Patrick T.
