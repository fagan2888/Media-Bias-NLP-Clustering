What happened in Charleston, S.C. was a lot of things \u2013 a crime, a tragedy, a massacre, a butchery, and, above all, an act of terror. President Obama referred to the South Carolina shootings as \u201csenseless murders.\u201d That was a terrible mistake; it\u2019s not just wrong \u2013 it\u2019s dangerous and misleading.\n\nLanguage can obscure as much as it reveals. It\u2019s important, now more than ever, to be clear, to call things by their proper name; to do otherwise is to risk confusion where none exists. What happened in Charleston was terrorism. Period. And terrorism, whatever else it is, is not senseless; it\u2019s precisely the opposite.\n\nTerror is a tactic, not a cause. This is a crucially important distinction. Terrorists are calculating: they do what they do in order to inspire fear. If Dylann Roof had decided, on a whim, to gun down the first people he encountered \u2013 that would be senseless. But Dylann Roof was no nihilist. He believed in something. He was a racist. And he was propelled by specific ideas \u2013 about history, about black people, about white supremacy, and about various other cultural mythologies. \u201cYou rape our women, and you\u2019re taking over our country, and you have to go,\u201d he remarked just before filling that church and those bodies with holes. These are not the words of a mentally ill person committing a senseless act; they are the cold, clear thoughts of a man on a mission, a man who knows exactly what he\u2019s doing and why he\u2019s doing it. And this is why Dylann Roof is a terrorist.\n\nIt\u2019s been troubling to watch the media vacillate in their coverage of this story. Was it a hate crime? Was it terrorism? If there\u2019s clarity about anything at all here, it\u2019s about the motivations of the killer. He\u2019s a terrorist, and he told us so. He wanted to send a message. Was he motivated by hate? Sure. But the act itself was terroristic by any measure.\n\nAs many have pointed out, the media is unsure about what constitutes terrorism only when white people are the perpetrators. White men with guns are \u201clone wolves\u201d or \u201cmentally ill\u201d or depraved criminals. Brown men with bombs are very obviously \u201cterrorists.\u201d This is a double standard with consequences. \u201cTerrorism\u201d is a word that resonates; it inspires urgency and collective action, both of which are needed if we\u2019re to deal with the underlying problems. If white people can\u2019t, by definition, be terrorists, then the term has no practical meaning; it\u2019s about the actor, not the act. If terrorism is something only brown people do, then we should be honest and admit that. We should say that terrorism is about the color of the criminal, not the intent of the crime.\n\nEquivocating about the nature of the crime has an additional consequence: It diminishes the role of ideas. We can think of the human brain as a piece of hardware, and of ideas as software motivating behavior. Rather than focusing on the mental state of the murderer, we should be talking about the ideas that inspired the murders. Dylann Roof believed his country was under assault by black people. He walked into that church and killed those people under the delusion that he was a soldier in a war. The question is why did he think this? Where did he get this idea?", "article_metadata": {"description": "This wasn't simply a hate crime or a senseless murder.
