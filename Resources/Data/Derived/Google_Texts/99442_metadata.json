While it\u2019s unclear what this will mean for the company\u2019s 60 employees, WINhealth is no longer accepting new subscribers and will only serve current subscribers through the end of the year.\n\n\u201cAs long as everyone keeps paying premiums we will continue to serve them through the end of the year,\u201d Rooney said.\n\nEarlier this month, the company said it planned to withdraw from the individual insurance market through the federal healthcare exchanges in 2016 after the federal government backed down on promises to pay about $5 million through its risk corridor program. The program sought to guarantee that a company couldn\u2019t go under by assuming too much risk while taking on high-cost subscribers as barriers to entry were removed to the insurance market.\n\nSince risk went up along with uncertainty, the government placed into effect the temporary risk corridors program to reimburse insurers who were experiencing higher-than-expected outflows. It also protected the government by ensuring that insurers didn\u2019t raise premiums to rapidly, according to Rooney. But the federal government came up far short, announcing through the Centers for Medicare and Medical Services that it would only pony up 12.6 percent of the requests. That led to a $4.4 million shortfall at WINhealth that is proving fatal.\n\n\u201cInsurers across the country also had a bad experience \u2013 meaning they also had high claims. Really high claims,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cThe federal government just doesn\u2019t have the money to pay it.\u201d\n\nFor WINhealth, which only has about 8,400 individual members, 5,200 group members and about 3,000 third-party administrator members in Wyoming, that was money they counted on and expected to continue operating.\n\nWednesday morning, the Wyoming Department of Insurance filed a petition in a Laramie County court to place WINhealth into a rehabilitation/receivership after determining through a series of meetings that the Wyoming insurer is operating under hazardous financial conditions.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have sufficient assets to pay their claims,\u201d said Tom Glause, commissioner of the Wyoming Department of Insurance in a phone interview.\n\nWhile WINhealth doesn\u2019t yet have a clear picture of what the receivership/rehabilitation request from the state could mean, Rooney said WINhealth is voluntarily surrendering its certificate of authority to be an insurer in the state of Wyoming.\n\n\u201cAssuming it\u2019s granted, [the receivership] will allow the Insurance Department to take over the operations of WINhealth,\u201d Glause said. \u201cWe will marshal their assets, we will process and pay their claims and we will see an orderly transition of policy holders to another carrier.\u201d\n\nWhile the risk corridor hurdle proved too much for WINhealth, Glause said he was confident Wyoming\u2019s other main insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming, can weather the storm.\n\nWINhealth subscribers must continue to pay their dues in order to receive benefits, but both Rooney and Glause indicated if they did so, their claims would be paid before they transition to another carrier. Still, Glause estimated the company would face a $15 million shortfall by Jan. 1. The receivership wouldn\u2019t put the state in jeopardy for the claims, since a third organization created statutorily, the Wyoming Life and Health Guarantee Association, handles insolvencies and deficiencies, assessing all insurance companies to provide payment for deficiencies.\n\nRooney placed the blame for WINhealth\u2019s probable demise at the feet of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI think when we decided to participate in the ACA and exchanges we went all in,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cWe took a lot of risks; operated in an environment filled with uncertainties. \u2026 We had our heart in it and we fought really hard to make it a positive outcome.\u201d\n\nThe negative outcome hurts, she said, leaving 60 employees and thousands of subscribers\u2019 fate in the air.\n\n\u201cI just have no idea how long people will be employed or how many,\u201d she said, noting a core group of employees would need to stick around, at the least.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s painful, I think, for the whole state of Wyoming,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cI think WINhealth was really good for the state. It hurts for our employees and the community.\u201d\n\nSen. John Barrasso, a former doctor and vocal opponent to the ACA, used WINhealth\u2019s failure as a stump on the senate floor Wednesday morning.\n\n\u201c[WINhealth] said that it had to stop selling Obamacare plans because there was just no way to make money without big taxpayer subsidies coming from Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cThis company was already planning to raise rates significantly next year. It turns out that even that wasn\u2019t going to be enough money to make it worthwhile.\u201d\n\nHe noted that means only Blue Cross Blue Shield of Wyoming is left to sell on the federal exchange, eliminating the supposedly competitive aspect that the exchanges were supposed to encourage.\n\nPatrick Wolfinbarger contributed to this story.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wyoming's only statewide business journal", "og": {"site_name": "Wyoming Business Report", "description": "CHEYENNE \u2013 Wyoming insurer WINhealth Partners isn\u2019t healthy, and its...read more \u2192", "title": "WINhealth dying after amputated Obamacare kickback - Wyoming Business Report", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://wyomingbusinessreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Goldstone.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-22T09:19:44-06:00", "url": "http://wyomingbusinessreport.com/winhealth-dying-after-amputated-obamacare-kickback/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Wyoming Business Report", "description": "CHEYENNE \u2013 Wyoming insurer WINhealth Partners isn\u2019t healthy, and its...read more \u2192", "title": "WINhealth dying after amputated Obamacare kickback - Wyoming Business Report", "image": {"src": "http://wyomingbusinessreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Goldstone.jpg"}, "creator": "@wyobizreport", "site": "@wyobizreport", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 703433899}, "article": {"section": "Uncategorized", "tag": "Government & Politics,Health Care,Today's News", "published_time": "2015-10-21T12:42:49-06:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-22T09:19:44-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdffe5\"", "article_summary": "WINhealth dying after amputated Obamacare kickbackCHEYENNE \u2013 Wyoming insurer WINhealth Partners isn\u2019t healthy, and its subscribers will need to find another avenue for health insurance by 2016.\n\u201cAssuming it\u2019s granted, [the receivership] will allow the Insurance Department to take over the operations of WINhealth,\u201d Glause said.\nReally high claims,\u201d Rooney said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s painful, I think, for the whole state of Wyoming,\u201d Rooney said.\n\u201c[WINhealth] said that it had to stop selling Obamacare plans because there was just no way to make money without big taxpayer subsidies coming from Washington,\u201d he said."}
