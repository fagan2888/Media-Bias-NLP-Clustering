Employers spent an average of $11,204 per worker for health benefits in 2014, up 4.6 percent from a year earlier, according to Mercer LLC. That growth rate was 6.1 percent or more each year from 1998 to 2011.\n\nHealth Costs\n\nVF has seen healthcare costs accelerate slightly in the last two years, though the added expense hasn\u2019t changed the number of employees covered, Shearer said. That puts the Greensboro, North Carolina-based company in line with other employers, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe average premium for covered workers in 2014 was $6,025 a year for an individual, up 2 percent from 2013, and $16,834 for a family, a 3 percent increase. Some companies are using higher co-payments and deductibles to require workers to share more costs.\n\n\u201cWe have done some things we think are positive for employees and the company, including putting out more options like high-deductible plans and plans with health savings accounts,\u201d said Jeff Huebschen, a spokesman for G&K Services Inc., a uniform-rental company in Minnetonka, Minnesota. \u201cMore choices, and it kept our company\u2019s cost in check.\u201d\n\nSome provisions of Obamacare are still being implemented and could drive costs higher in the future. For example, the so- called Cadillac tax on the most generous insurance plans takes effect in 2018.\n\nBurrito Chain\n\nFor now, the additional costs of Obamacare are coming in the form of requirements to cover more workers. Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. said this month that the cost of covering more than 1,000 employees who work 30 hours a week or more \u2014 a key requirement of Obamacare \u2014 will add as much as $8 million to health insurance expenses in 2015. That\u2019s less than 1 percent of its projected operating profit for this year, based on the average estimate of analysts compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nWal-Mart Stores Inc., the biggest U.S. employer, had bigger healthcare costs this year than it anticipated, with more workers enrolling and costs rising faster than it expected, Greg Foran, chief executive officer of the company\u2019s U.S. unit, said in August. The retailer estimated then that its healthcare expenses would rise by about $500 million last year. That\u2019s about 0.1 percent of its annual revenue, or 1.8 percent of operating profit.\n\n\u201cWhile enrollment was higher than anticipated, we are pleased our associates and their families continue to take advantage of our affordable health-care opportunities,\u201d Foran said. Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nNonfinancial Challenges\n\nA smaller retailer, Casey\u2019s General Stores Inc., said employee health insurance enrollment climbed 19 percent for this year. That was partially because the company has been growing, Chief Financial Officer Bill Walljasper said in an e-mail. The higher enrollment will lead to an increase of as much as $6 million in health-care expenses, he said. That\u2019s about 2 percent of annual operating profit.\n\nFor large employers, the biggest challenge from the law may have been reworking their benefits structure rather than any major financial impact, said Paul Fronstin, director of health research at the Washington-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, an industry group.\n\n\u201cThey had to do the work to come into compliance; for a lot of employers, that was a big headache and a distraction,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \u201cMaybe the effect wasn\u2019t as large as what was originally anticipated, but there was an effect.\u201d\n\n\u2013With assistance from Renee Dudley in Boston and Lauren Coleman-Lochner and Lindsey Rupp in New York.\n\nCopyright 2016 Bloomberg.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.insurancejournal.com/rss/mostpopular/&id=5; cycle=1", "description": "The biggest entitlement legislation in a generation is causing barely a ripple in corporate America.
