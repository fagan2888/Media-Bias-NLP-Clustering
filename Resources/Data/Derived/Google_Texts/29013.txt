Right-handed pitcher Jordan Lyles on Sunday was moved to the Rockies‘ 60-day disabled list after tests revealed his broken hand was not fully healed, manager Walt Weiss said.

Lyles was also involved in a car accident Friday in Denver, but Weiss said the setback to his lingering hand injury was not a direct result of the crash.

Lyles broke a bone in his glove hand while covering home plate during a loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks at Coors Field on June 4. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list the next day.

After the Rockies’ game Friday night in Denver, Lyles was in a car accident. He was not driving, but he did receive cuts to his face, Weiss said.

“It was a minor accident. But he doesn’t look real pretty,” Weiss said.

Lyles was set to begin a rehab stint with the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox on Friday. And the Rockies thought he could return to the big-league roster by the end of July.

But, after 43 days already on the disabled list, Lyles will be out at least 17 more days. It’s unclear the setback will affect his rehab schedule.

“His hand showed he needed more time,” Weiss said of Lyles’s X-Ray results this weekend.

Lyles’ move to the DL allowed the Rockies to bring back pitcher Brett Anderson to their 40-man roster to pitch Sunday, when Colorado hosts the Twins at 2:10 p.m. MT.

To make room on their game-day roster for Anderson, the Rockies dropped infielder Kyle Parker back to Triple-A Colorado Springs.
