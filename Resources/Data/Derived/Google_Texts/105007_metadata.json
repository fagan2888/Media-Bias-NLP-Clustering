But federal prosecutors mentioned DeFoggi's screen names often in court.\n\nSick: Timothy DeFoggi, a former acting director of cyber security for the U.S. Department of health and Human services, was convicted Tuesday on federal charges of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, conspiracy to advertise and distribute child pornography, and accessing a computer with intent to view child pornography\n\nThis chart, from the HHS fiscal 2014 'Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees' related to the 'Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund,' shows that during 2013 Timothy DeFoggi was in charge of operating-system security on all of HHS computers\n\nKevin Charest (top C), chief information security officer for the Department of Health and Human Services Department, was DeFoggi's boss at HHS\n\nIn one court filing, his lawyer conceded that 'In the \"About Me\" section of username \"f***christ's\" profile on \"Website A,\" it says: \"Have many perversions. Contact me for fantasy chat.\"\n\nThe attorney argued, unsuccessfully, that DeFoggi and his co-defendant, Zackary Austin, were engaging in harmless online fantasies.\n\n'According to evidence presented at trial,' the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement Tuesday, 'DeFoggi registered as a website member on March 2, 2012, and maintained his membership and activity until Dec. 8, 2012, when the website was taken down by the FBI.'\n\n'Through the website, DeFoggi accessed child pornography, solicited child pornography from other members, and exchanged private messages with other members where he expressed an interest in the violent rape and murder of children.'\n\n'DeFoggi even suggested meeting one member in person,' the DOJ statement added, 'to fulfill their mutual fantasies to violently rape and murder children.'\n\nThe grand jury's description of the crimes was so graphic that a judge agreed to order the redaction \u2013 the blacking out \u2013 of entire pages on the government's publicly accessible computer servers.\n\nMcGrath, a Nebraska native, ran a trio of child-porn websites through TOR, 'the onion router,' an open network within the Internet that allows users to hide from network surveillance and surf online without leaving digital footprints.\n\nThe FBI deployed a custom-made software program in a 2012 investigation it dubbed 'Operation Torpedo,' scouring every so-called '.onion' website it could find and determining which of them were related to illegal activity.\n\nMcGrath operated two of his sites on the network server 'farm' where he worked by day, and operated a third from his home computer.\n\nFederal investigators found that he had left his administrator password blank on one of the child pornography sites. They quickly began collecting information that could identify the computers that were accessing it.\n\nOne of the sites was a child-porn Facebook knockoff frequented by DeFoggi, 56, and another two dozen defendants the government identified.\n\nA federal grand jury indicted the former government computer security honcho on March 20, 2013. He faces sentencing in November.\n\nTrouble: Sylvia Matthews Burwell, the newly minted HHS secretary, now has a new PR headache to add to her already heaving pile of Obamacare woes\n\nAttorney General Eric Holder helms the Justice Department, which announced DeFoggi's conviction on Tuesday in a four-day trial that involved seven criminal counts, all related to child pornography\n\nDeFoggi's name appears on an HHS organizational chart in a planning document related to the agency's fiscal year 2014 budget request.\n\nThe document describes him as being in charge of 'OS IT Security Operations,' reporting directly to HHS Chief Information Security Officer Kevin Charest.\n\nHHS did not immediately respond to questions about when he left his job, and whether he was on the government's payroll while his charges were pending.\n\nOther defendants snared by Operation Torpedo are named in court documents as Kirk Cottom, Vincent Diberardino, Jason Flanary, Michael Huyck, Brandon Moore, David William Peer, Russell Glenn Pierce, Kevin Pitman, Gary Reibert, John Sebes, Thomas Spencer and Joshua Welch.\n\nThe FBI said Tuesday that DeFoggi was the sixth to be successfully prosecuted.\n\nWhen he ordered DeFoggi held without bail in May 2013, U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas D. Thalken noted that he appeared 'to have a mental condition which may affect whether the defendant will appear' if he were given bond.\n\nIt's not clear what that condition is, or whether it will have an impact on sentencing.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Former,HHS,cyber,security,chief,convicted,CHILD,PORN,case,using,screen,names,F,Christ,PT,eater,underground,website", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2735176/Former-HHS-cyber-security-chief-convicted-CHILD-PORN-case-using-screen-names-F-Christ-PT-eater-underground-website.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Timothy DeFoggi, a former acting director of cyber security at HHS, was convicted Tuesday in federal court and faces sentencing in November.", "title": "Former HHS cyber chief (alias 'F***Christ') guilty in CHILD PORN case", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2735176/Former-HHS-cyber-security-chief-convicted-CHILD-PORN-case-using-screen-names-F-Christ-PT-eater-underground-website.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/08/27/1409143410685_wps_4_A_federal_jury_in_Omaha_h.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2735176/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2735176/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "keywords": "Former,HHS,cyber,security,chief,convicted,CHILD,PORN,case,using,screen,names,F,Christ,PT,eater,underground,website", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2735176, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-08-27T00:12:20.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=David+Martosko,+US+Political+Editor+for+MailOnline", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2014-08-27T20:43:08.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Former HHS cyber security chief convicted CHILD PORN case using screen names F Christ PT eater underground website"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Timothy DeFoggi, a former acting director of cyber security at HHS, was convicted Tuesday in federal court and faces sentencing in November.", "title": "Former HHS cyber chief (alias 'F***Christ') guilty in CHILD PORN case", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2735176/Former-HHS-cyber-security-chief-convicted-CHILD-PORN-case-using-screen-names-F-Christ-PT-eater-underground-website.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/08/27/1409143410685_wps_4_A_federal_jury_in_Omaha_h.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "Timothy DeFoggi, a former acting director of cyber security at HHS, was convicted Tuesday in federal court and faces sentencing in November."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1f8c\"", "article_summary": "'Through the website, DeFoggi accessed child pornography, solicited child pornography from other members, and exchanged private messages with other members where he expressed an interest in the violent rape and murder of children.'\nFederal investigators found that he had left his administrator password blank on one of the child pornography sites.\nThe document describes him as being in charge of 'OS IT Security Operations,' reporting directly to HHS Chief Information Security Officer Kevin Charest.\nTimothy DeFoggi, a former acting director of cyber security for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, was convicted Tuesday on federal charges of engaging in a child exploitation enterprise, conspiracy to advertise and distribute child pornography, and accessing a computer with intent to view child pornography.\nA Nebraska jury handed down seven separate guilty verdicts following a four-day trial, in connection with his membership in a child pornography website operated by Aaron McGrath, 31, before his arrest, conviction and sentencing to a 20-year prison term."}
