Despite how mainstream these sites have become, though, the legal landscape governing these activities remains murky and should be reviewed.\u201d\n\nReid: NFL More Concerned About Deflategate Than Racist Name\n\nPallone, the ranking Democrat on the Energy and Commerce Committee, sent a letter to Chairman Fred Upton, R-Mich., and Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade Subcommittee Chairman Michael C. Burgess, R-Texas, asking for a review of the leagues' legal status, in particular how the leagues, which offer cash prizes to fans who pay to join, differ from sports betting, which is not legal in all states.\n\nOnline sports betting and online gambling are prohibited under federal law, but the leagues are taking advantage of a loophole that has become known as the fantasy sports \u201ccarve out,\u201d according to Pallone.\n\nThis loophole has blurred the lines between betting conducted through fantasy sports websites and online gambling.\n\n\u201cFans are currently allowed to risk money on the performance of an individual player. How is that different than wagering money on the outcome of a game?\u201d Pallone said.\n\nThe full text of the letter can be found here .\n\nSee photos, follies, HOH Hits and Misses and more at Roll Call's new video site.
