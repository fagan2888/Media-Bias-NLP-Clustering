But these interruptions in the medication expose patients to increased risk of blood clots three to five days before and three to five days after procedures.\n\nPhysicians have relied on a \u201cbridge therapy\u201d to lessen the risk of blood clots \u2014 treatment with a faster-acting, shorter-lived anticoagulant during the gap in warfarin use. However, the Kaiser Permanente study published Tuesday in JAMA Internal Medicine finds bridging, part of standard therapy for many years, might create more risks than benefits for patients with low to moderate risk for blood clots.\n\n\u201cThe increased risk of bleeding coupled with the low risk of VTE (venous thromboembolism) recurrence for these patients indicate this therapy may be unnecessary and potentially harmful for that patient population,\u201d said lead author Nathan Clark, a clinical pharmacy supervisor with Kaiser Permanente Colorado, in a statement.\n\nMore than 900,000 cases of VTE occur each year in the United States, making it the third-most common cardiovascular illness behind heart attack and stroke, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBefore the study, limited data were available on rates of bleeding and clot recurrence, Kaiser Permanente researchers said. From January 2006 to March 2012, they examined the medical records of 1,178 patients with VTE who had 1,812 invasive diagnostic or surgical procedures, for which warfarin treatment was discontinued.\n\nA total of 555 patients received bridging anticoagulant therapy, and 1,257 did not. Bridge therapy resulted in a 17-fold higher risk of bleeding without a significant difference in the rate of blood clot formation, compared with the patients who didn\u2019t receive bridge therapy, the study found.\n\nThe study was conducted in partnership with the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Denver Health Medical Center, University of Utah College of Pharmacy and others.\n\nElecta Draper: 303-954-1276, edraper@denverpost.com or twitter.com/electadraper", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Kaiser Permanente study finds common therapy increases surgical risks", "title": "Kaiser Permanente study finds common therapy increases surgical risks", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/26/kaiser-permanente-study-finds-common-therapy-increases-surgical-risks/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-26T14:14:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-05-26T14:14:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Before the study, limited data were available on rates of bleeding and clot recurrence, Kaiser Permanente researchers said.\nHowever, the Kaiser Permanente study published Tuesday in JAMA Internal Medicine finds bridging, part of standard therapy for many years, might create more risks than benefits for patients with low to moderate risk for blood clots.\nBut these interruptions in the medication expose patients to increased risk of blood clots three to five days before and three to five days after procedures.\nPhysicians have relied on a \u201cbridge therapy\u201d to lessen the risk of blood clots \u2014 treatment with a faster-acting, shorter-lived anticoagulant during the gap in warfarin use.\nPatients vulnerable to potentially fatal blood clots who take blood-thinners have a 17-fold higher risk of serious bleeding after undergoing surgery if given short-acting anticoagulants around procedures, according to a Kaiser Permanente study published Tuesday."}
