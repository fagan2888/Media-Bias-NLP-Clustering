She joined in May 2010\n\n\n\nThe women are both members of the Association of Black Princeton Alumni\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services reviewed only CGI\u2019s bid for the Obamacare account even though four companies submitted bids\n\nCGI became an approved government vendor in 2007\n\n\n\nThe Obama administration has been accused of cronyism after it was revealed Michelle Obama's Princeton classmate is an executive at the company contracted to build the beleaguered Obamacare website.\n\n\n\nToni Townes-Whitley is senior vice president at CGI Federal, the U.S. arm of a Canadian company which won the no-bid contract for the problem-plagued website.\n\n\n\nTownes-Whitley, from the Princeton class of \u201985, and Michelle Obama are members of the Association of Black Princeton Alumni, according to The Daily Caller.\n\nFriends: First Lady Michelle Obama (left) and Toni-Townes Whitley, CGI Federal senior vice president, were classmates at Princeton\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Washington Examiner reported the Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid handed CGI Obamacare account without putting the contract out to competitive tender.\n\nIt has since been revealed four companies submitted bids, but only CGI was considered for the $93 million Healthcare.gov contract.\n\n\n\nWashington Examiner reported this is because CGI became an approved government vendor in 2007.\n\nThis meant the company could be assigned government contracts worth up to $4 billion until 2017 without having to bid publicly for them.\n\n\n\nThe company was approved before Barack Obama was first inaugurated in 2009.\n\nTownes-Whitley reportedly joined CGI in May 2010.\n\nCGI was one of 16 companies qualified under the Bush administration to provide certain tech services to the federal government.\n\nTech bugs with Healthcare.gov aren't limited to the sign-up process: Data files getting to insurance companies are often flawed as well\n\nHowever the discovery of Michelle Obama's relationship with a top executive at CGI Federal has sparked a social media storm, with Twitter punters accusing the Obama administration of cronyism.\n\nDan Carpenter \u200fwrote: 'Isn't this cozy?????\"Toni Townes-Whitley, Princeton class of \u201985, is senior vice president at CGI.'\n\n\n\nCitizenwells \u200fwrote: 'CGI Obamacare website contract Obamas (Barack & Michelle) crony capitalism or poor judgement.'\n\n\n\nRadio personality Mark Simone wrote: 'How did bumbling CGI get a $678 mill no-bid contract to build the website? They were friends with Michelle.'\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Washington Examiner reported CGI has a troubled track record for the delivery of government contracts, highlighting a time when it failed to meet the deadline for a new online medical registry for diabetes patients and treatment providers.\n\nOntario, Canada, government officials cancelled the $46.2 million contract after 14 months of delay in September 2012. Ontario officials currently refuse to pay any fees to CGI for the failed IT project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Michelle,Os,Princeton,classmate,exec,company,built,Obamacare,website", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2477403/Michelle-Os-Princeton-classmate-exec-company-built-Obamacare-website.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s Princeton classmate, Toni Townes-Whitley (pictured), is a top executive at the company that earned the contract to build the Obamacare website.", "title": "Michelle O's Princeton classmate is exec at company that built Obamacare website", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2477403/Michelle-Os-Princeton-classmate-exec-company-built-Obamacare-website.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/26/article-2477403-18FF0C5A00000578-281_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2477403, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Michelle,Os,Princeton,classmate,exec,company,built,Obamacare,website", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "section": "News", "tag": "Michelle Os Princeton classmate exec company built Obamacare website", "published_time": "2013-10-26T15:23:35.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "modified_time": "2013-10-26T19:39:22.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s Princeton classmate, Toni Townes-Whitley (pictured), is a top executive at the company that earned the contract to build the Obamacare website.", "title": "Michelle O's Princeton classmate is exec at company that built Obamacare website", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2477403/Michelle-Os-Princeton-classmate-exec-company-built-Obamacare-website.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/26/article-2477403-18FF0C5A00000578-281_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s Princeton classmate, Toni Townes-Whitley (pictured), is a top executive at the company that earned the contract to build the Obamacare website."}, "article_summary": "Townes-Whitley, from the Princeton class of \u201985, and Michelle Obama are members of the Association of Black Princeton Alumni, according to The Daily Caller.\nCitizenwells \u200fwrote: 'CGI Obamacare website contract Obamas (Barack & Michelle) crony capitalism or poor judgement.'\nRevealed: Michelle Obama's Princeton classmate is top executive at firm that that built disastrous Obamacare website after being awarded no-bid $93m contractMichelle Obama\u2019s Princeton classmate is an executive at the company that built Obamacare websiteToni Townes-Whitley is senior vice president at CGI Federal which earned contract to build the site.\nToni Townes-Whitley is senior vice president at CGI Federal, the U.S. arm of a Canadian company which won the no-bid contract for the problem-plagued website.\nRadio personality Mark Simone wrote: 'How did bumbling CGI get a $678 mill no-bid contract to build the website?"}
