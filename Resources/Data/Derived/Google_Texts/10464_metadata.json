Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, D-N.D., Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., were among those in attendance at the minimum $250 event, reports Capital New York.\n\nShe spoke with the crowd about the need for Congress to come together to pass the Fair Pay law, a future stimulus and to fully support the implementation of the troubled Affordable Care Act.\n\nThen taking one of the president\u2019s own tag lines: \u201cBut please, let us be very clear. Barack hasn\u2019t done any of this alone, just sitting by himself in the Oval Office \u2013 so sad,\u201d she said to laughter. \u201cFortunately he has not been alone.\u201d\n\nShe expressed her frustration that the president has had to issue executive orders due to failures from Congress to unite on certain legislation, specifically mentioning the DREAM Act.\n\n\u201cThe DREAM Act \u2014 an act that gives immigrant kids a fair shot, kids brought here by their parents through no fault of their own \u2014 this act failed.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere in America, while we expect everyone to do their fair share, we also believe that we should give everyone a fair shot,\u201d Obama stated. \u201cWe believe that everyone should have the basic security they need to provide for their families, give their kids a decent chance in life. And that\u2019s the kind of security that I and I know so many of you grew up with.\u201d\n\nThe first lady noted Congress\u2019 failure to pass \u201ccommon sense\u201d gun legislation last spring by just six votes.\n\nMoving forward, she reiterated the need to focus on the 2014 midterm elections and the financial support needed for Democratic support.\n\n\u201cSo make no mistake about it, the midterm elections matter. They matter. And if you want to bring some change to Congress, then we can\u2019t just sit around feeling angry or helpless or hopeless,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s something that we and all of you can do right now, today, to make a huge difference and it\u2019s simple: You can write a big old fat check,\u201d she said to laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need you to do right now. Write a big check, big huge one.
