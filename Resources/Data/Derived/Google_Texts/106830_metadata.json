Cory Booker of New Jersey with an award on Monday, saying Booker\u2019s \u201cpersonal mission in life \u2026 embodies the mission and values of the University's Felician/Franciscan heritage \u2014 compassion, justice and peace, and finding goodness in all God's creation.\u201d\n\nBooker was awarded Felician University\u2019s 2016 Martin Luther King Jr. Legacy Award, an award \u201ccreated by Felician University to honor Dr.King and to do so by recognizing individuals who strive to fulfill Dr. King's dream of equality and justice,\u201d according to a University press release.\n\nThe University website lists \u201cRespect for Human Dignity\u201d as its first core value, stating that it maintains \u201creverence for and commitment to promoting and protecting the dignity of persons.\u201d In honoring Booker, the former mayor of Newark, N.J., who became a U.S. Senator in 2013, the University promoted a known supporter of abortion, which the U.S. bishops have made clear, \u201cends the life of a child and offends God.\u201d National Review Online went so far as to label Booker\u2019s pro-abortion views as \u201cAbortion Extremism.\u201d\n\nOn his campaign website, Booker declared his support for abortion, pushed to protect the contraceptive provisions in the Affordable Care Act and condemned public defunding of Planned Parenthood. Booker also garnered a 100 percent rating by NARAL Pro-Choice America, and a zero percent rating by the National Right to Life Committee. Additionally, Booker is endorsed by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u2019s largest LGBT-rights organization.\n\nThe Cardinal Newman Society reached out to Felician University President Anne Prisco\u2019s office and University officials to explain the conflict between Booker\u2019s views on abortion and the University\u2019s values and Catholic identity, and how the University goes about selecting and vetting its honorees. No response was received by time of publication.\n\nIn 2004, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops released a document requiring Catholic institutions to withhold honors and platforms from public opponents of Church teaching. The document, \u201cCatholics in Political Life,\u201d stipulates:\n\nThe Catholic community and Catholic institutions should not honor those who act in defiance of our fundamental moral principles. They should not be given awards, honors or platforms which would suggest support for their actions.\n\nYet Prisco, the first secular leader in Felician University\u2019s history, was full of praise for the senator in the University\u2019s statement. While she spoke about Booker using words like \u201clife,\u201d \u201copportunity\u201d and \u201cgenerations yet to come,\u201d she failed to address the contradictory nature of honoring a pro-abortion politician at a Catholic university.\n\n\u201cHigher education is all about hope,\u201d she said. \u201cEducation breeds hope for a better and healthier life\u2014a life of opportunity, productivity, prosperity, and perhaps most important, improving the world condition for generations yet to come.\u201d\n\nBooker was selected for the award based upon three criteria, according to the University\u2019s news release (emphasis added):\n\n-An individual whose life's work reflects and promotes the University's core values\u2014especially passion for issues related to social justice, civil rights and economic equality.\n\n-A personal mission in life that also embodies the mission and values of the University's Felician/Franciscan heritage\u2014compassion, justice and peace, and finding goodness in all God's creation.\n\n-A person who compels all people to give the gift of hope.\n\n\u201cWhile it is truly humbling to be honored by Felician University today, I share this recognition with the thousands of ordinary Americans who stepped up with extraordinary courage to change the path of a nation,\u201d Booker was quoted as saying in the University\u2019s press release. \u201cI applaud Felician for their tireless commitment to education, and look forward to continuing to work with great New Jersey institutions like theirs as we carry on Dr. King's legacy and strive towards the dream of a more equal and just America.\u201d\n\nPrisco continued to praise Booker on Twitter Monday night following the award ceremony. \u201c@CoryBooker our @Felician community is grateful for your inspiring talk, may kindness reign! & I think u \u2018rock\u2019 too,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nCatholic Education Daily is an online publication of The Cardinal Newman Society.
