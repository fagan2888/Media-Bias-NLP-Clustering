What do you have to be thankful for this year? Your family? Your job? That the First Lady isn’t keeping a watchful eye on how much pumpkin pie you eat?

The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank , has released a set of six Thanksgiving cards that poke fun at the Affordable Care Act and Michelle Obama’s “Let’s Move” initiative that promotes healthy eating and exercise. The cards are a cheeky way to “express exactly what we can all be thankful for this year,” according to the website.

The Heritage email blast also recommended sending a card to “that really annoying liberal in your life.”

One of the cards makes fun of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, while another card mocks the glitches of HealthCare.gov. See a couple of the cards below, and check out the Heritage website to see them all — and send one or two to your friends and family!
