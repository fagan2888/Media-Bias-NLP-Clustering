He had not arrived at Redskins Park in time to attend the meeting, leading to his benching for the 17-13 loss at San Francisco on Sunday.\n\nThe team also fined him an undisclosed sum for his actions.\n\n\u201cAs unfortunate as the situation was, I mean, at the end of the day, I am responsible to be here on time, no matter what the circumstance is,\u201d Amerson said. \u201cI definitely learned my lesson, and like I said, I\u2019ve just got to take it upon myself \u2014 and, no matter what, make sure I [get] here and be at work. It\u2019s definitely a lesson.\u201d\n\nThe Redskins cycled through cornerbacks in the loss to San Francisco, leaving the situation even more unpalatable for Amerson. E.J. Biggers left the game in the first quarter with a concussion, forcing strong safety Trenton Robinson to take snaps as the nickelback, and Tracy Porter, who replaced Amerson as a starter, strained the AC joint in his right shoulder and did not return.\n\nUndrafted rookie cornerback Greg Ducre, who had played in two games on special teams, shuffled into the lineup to replace Porter. Strong safety Phillip Thomas also saw his first snaps on defense, filling in late with free safety Ryan Clark leaving the game after experiencing a stinger.\n\n\u201cI think it was the best thing to do,\u201d said defensive coordinator Jim Haslett. \u201cMaybe it wasn\u2019t the best thing to do at the time because of who we were playing and we needed him, but I think it was the best thing for this team, and for him as a player. I think it was important that we did what we did.\u201d\n\nAmerson, who started the first 10 games, will be back on the field Sunday when the Redskins visit Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cI feel like I was letting the whole organization down with me not being here and not being able to play, especially with all the injuries that went down,\u201d Amerson said. \u201cI think \u2014 I knew \u2014 I felt it the most out of anybody in the organization. It was unfortunate, but it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Amerson expressed remorse for missing a team meeting last week, vowing that the sequence of events that led to his one-game suspension will not happen again.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Amerson expressed remorse for missing a team meeting last week, vowing that the sequence of events that led to his one-game suspension will not happen again.", "title": "Redskins\u2019 David Amerson on one-game suspension: \u2018It\u2019s definitely a lesson\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/28/redskins-david-amerson-one-game-suspension-its-def/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/02/redskins-vikings-foot_lanc.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/02/redskins-vikings-foot_lanc.jpg", "description": "Amerson expressed remorse for missing a team meeting last week, vowing that the sequence of events that led to his one-game suspension will not happen again.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Redskins\u2019 David Amerson on one-game suspension: \u2018It\u2019"}, "Author": "Zac Boyer", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, David Amerson"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2bd3\"", "article_summary": "David Amerson expressed remorse for missing a team meeting last week, vowing that the sequence of events that led to his one-game suspension will not happen again.\nAmerson, one of the Redskins\u2019 starting cornerbacks, was unaware that a meeting had been moved to early in the morning.\nStrong safety Phillip Thomas also saw his first snaps on defense, filling in late with free safety Ryan Clark leaving the game after experiencing a stinger.\nIt\u2019s definitely a lesson.\u201dThe Redskins cycled through cornerbacks in the loss to San Francisco, leaving the situation even more unpalatable for Amerson.\n\u201cI think it was the best thing to do,\u201d said defensive coordinator Jim Haslett."}
