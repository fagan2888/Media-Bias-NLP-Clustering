This November, we will get to vote for universal health care for Colorado. If voted in, ColoradoCare (Amendment 69) will, by eliminating insurance company involvement, provide better health care than our present system, and cost less. There will be no deductibles and very low co-pays.\n\nThe plan expands the benefits of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicare. The Affordable Care Act improved our health coverage, but premiums are still too high, and costs can be overwhelming for people with chronic diseases. And it still leaves too many uninsured or underinsured. With ColoradoCare, every Coloradan will be 100% covered \u2013 no exceptions. No more bankruptcies due to exorbitant medical bills.\n\nCurrently, insurance companies provide only a narrow choice of doctors and facilities. Under ColoradoCare, you can go to any provider. You get to choose, not some insurance company.\n\nColoradoCare will be organized like a credit union, owned by and accountable to the residents of Colorado. Medical costs will be paid through a state tax, adjusted for income. With no insurance premiums to pay, most of us will save money overall. It will simplify health care, relieve doctors of a huge paperwork burden, and be cheaper for employers. It\u2019s a big win for all of us.\n\nToo good to be true? How can this possibly work? It works because it eliminates the colossal amounts that insurance companies spend on paperwork, fancy marketing, and huge executive salaries.\n\nColoradoCare will be furiously opposed by the insurance industry. They will spend enormous amounts trying to defeat it, and will organize an immense barrage of letters, articles, and TV ads opposing it. Keep that in mind as you make up your own.\n\nTo learn more: www.ColoradoCareYES.co\n\nby", "article_metadata": {"verify-v1": "ZwMdlstYe7eu9N7No5I9qBot9m7z9djLR68McJ/BT6Q=", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "North Denver Tribune": "North Denver News, Northwest Denver Tribune, Schools, Pet of the Week, Restaurants, Elisa Cohen, Zoning, Politics, Letters to the editor, new businesses, Journalism, Community Activists, Real estate, education", "robots": "follow, all", "language": "en"}, "article_summary": "A rare opportunity to consider Colorado health careArden Buck \u2013 Nederland, COThere\u2019s an unusual opportunity coming up.\nThis November, we will get to vote for universal health care for Colorado.\nIf voted in, ColoradoCare (Amendment 69) will, by eliminating insurance company involvement, provide better health care than our present system, and cost less.\nIt will simplify health care, relieve doctors of a huge paperwork burden, and be cheaper for employers.\nWith no insurance premiums to pay, most of us will save money overall."}
