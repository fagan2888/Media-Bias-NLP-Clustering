Stateline is a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Charitable Trusts that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.\n\nIn the \u201csala de espera,\u201d or waiting room, at La Clinica del Pueblo, a community health center in Washington, D.C., signs in Spanish encourage patients to \u201cEmpower yourself!\u201d and sign up for insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act.\n\nAdults slump in chairs, scribbling on application forms, texting friends, waiting. In a tiny office a few feet away, William Joachin, the center\u2019s patient access manager, faces down the frustrations of trying to navigate the federal health care program for the thousands of mostly Central American immigrants who flood the clinic each year. He\u2019s not alone.\n\nA year after open enrollment for the ACA began, one in four Latinos living in the U.S. does not have health insurance, according to new census data, more than any other ethnic population in the country\u2014and most states have few backups in place to help those in the coverage gap. Latino immigrants are the hardest hit: Foreign-born Hispanics are more than twice as likely to be uninsured than are U.S.-born Hispanics, according to census data compiled by the Pew Research Center. (Pew also funds Stateline.)\n\nA variety of factors account for this, including a lack of culturally specific outreach programs, language barriers, financial concerns, frustration with the ACA\u2019s complexities and fears that applying could jeopardize a family member\u2019s immigration status.\n\nIllustrating some of the challenges was the woman in Joachin\u2019s clinic who grew up in a Honduran refugee camp and couldn\u2019t read and write. As a legal resident, she\u2019s eligible to purchase health insurance through the exchanges, he said, but she doesn\u2019t know how to spell her name. With help, she first applied back in March and is still waiting.\n\nThere are also the former activists who fought against the government in El Salvador during the civil war in that country, and are exceedingly wary about any form of government program, even health insurance.\n\nThen there\u2019s the \u201cmixed status\u201d family with the son a citizen, the mother with temporary protected status, the father with a green card, the grandmother with a visa and the uncle seeking asylum.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s when it gets complicated,\u201d Joachin says.\n\n\u201cImmigrants want to do the right thing, want to buy health insurance,\u201d said Sonal Ambegaokar, senior attorney at the National Health Law Program. \u201cBut unfortunately, we put up barriers for them to get access. When we talk about a streamlined health enrollment system, we should really mean that it\u2019s for everybody.\u201d\n\nThe Uninsured\n\nFifty-six percent of noncitizen immigrants in the U.S. are Latino, many of whom are in the country illegally and are not eligible to purchase health insurance through the health exchanges, even if they can afford to pay.\n\nNationwide, 25 percent of Latinos do not have health insurance. Naturalized citizens from Latin America fare better than noncitizens; 21 percent are uninsured, compared to 49 percent of other Latin American immigrants who are not citizens. (About 14 percent of all U.S. residents do not have insurance.)\n\nOverall, children are more likely to have health insurance, thanks to a number of safety net programs, including Medicaid, the joint federal-state health care program for the poor, and the federal Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Despite this, Latino children are more than twice as likely as white children to be uninsured, according to the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), a Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization based in Washington. One in six Hispanic children does not have health coverage.\n\nBy comparison, one in 10 African-American children does not have health insurance, while one in 11 Asian-American children is uninsured. Latino children also account for the largest share of children in the U.S. who are eligible for programs like Medicaid/CHIP, but are not enrolled.\n\nFurther complicating matters, health advocates say, is most states have done little to remedy the issue. Twenty-four states have chosen not to expand Medicaid to more residents under the federal health care law, including Texas and Florida, which have the second- and third-largest Latino populations in the country.\n\nIn Texas, 50 percent of the state\u2019s Latinos are uninsured, according to NCLR, and Florida has the third-highest rate of uninsured at 36 percent. In California, which has the highest percentage of Latinos, nearly 60 percent are uninsured, according to the California Healthcare Foundation.\n\n\u201cJust with (Florida and Texas) alone, as long as they don\u2019t pass Medicaid expansion, we\u2019re going to be left with millions of Latinos uninsured,\u201d said Alejandra Gepp, associate director of the NCLR\u2019s Institute for Hispanic Health. \u201cThis costs millions. The cost to (states), having this large segment of uninsured people is huge, because people end up using the emergency room as services. By the time someone gets diagnosed with diabetes in an emergency room, it might be too late.\u201d\n\nComplicating Factors\n\nThe number of Latinos with health care coverage has increased 5.3 percent since the ACA took effect, according to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. But many remain uninsured.\n\nOne reason is that immigrants are more likely to be lower-income and are more likely to be making an hourly wage at construction or service jobs that don\u2019t offer employer-based insurance, according to Jennifer Sullivan, the director of the Best Practices Institute for Enroll America, a nonpartisan not-for-profit created to expand health care coverage around the country.\n\nEven if their jobs do offer health insurance, it\u2019s often cost prohibitive, Gepp said.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re making $10 an hour. After taxes, you\u2019re left with probably a check of no more than $400 a week at most,\u201d Gepp said. \u201cIf you have to pay $200 in health insurance each month, many decide not to purchase it.\u201d\n\nLanguage is also a big issue. The Spanish language translation for the federal health insurance exchange was filled with gaffes. In describing the cost of monthly premiums, for example, the website used the word \u201cprima\u201d for premium, which also means \u201cfemale cousin\u201d in Spanish.\n\nStates fared no better with their Spanish language translations. Oregon used the error-prone Google Translate for its exchange. California, despite its large Latino population, offers poor translations, according to Lisa Clemans-Cope, a researcher at the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Policy Institute. There is a Spanish language paper application, but it takes much longer to fill out, creating yet another barrier for immigrants, said Ambegaokar.\n\nMiddle-class Latinos are more likely to apply online for insurance, but lower-income Hispanics and more recent immigrants with limited English skills generally prefer to do so in person through a facilitator or over the phone, advocates said.\n\nTrust is also a major factor for families who fear that enrolling in the exchange could jeopardize their immigration status, despite reassurances from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to the contrary, Ambegaokar said. \u201cBut if there\u2019s an immigration raid in that community, it\u2019s not very reassuring.\u201d\n\nSome State Efforts\n\nThere are no statewide safety nets in place for undocumented immigrants and foreign-born residents who are here legally but have not been in the country long enough to qualify for public health programs, according to Gepp. People with \u201cpermanent residency\u201d status, who have a green card, must have been in the country for at least five years to qualify for Medicaid. There is no restriction to get insurance under the ACA as long as applicants are in the country legally and have a Social Security number.\n\nIn California, where Latinos make up 50 percent of the population, Democratic state Senator Ricardo Lara introduced the Health for All Act, earlier this year, which would expand health care coverage for all Californians, regardless of immigration status. Under the bill, some 700,000 undocumented residents would have access to primary health care in 2015. (Young people who are undocumented and have deportation deferrals are eligible for Medicaid in the state.)\n\nCurrently, California doesn\u2019t cover undocumented residents statewide, but there are various county-level programs that do. California also has state funded Medicaid coverage for people who are designated as having \"Permanent residence under color of law\u201d (PRUCOL), including youth with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, and other state-funded coverage for pregnant women regardless of status, according to Gilberto Mendoza, policy associate with the National Conference on State Legislatures.\n\nSeveral other states also provide coverage for pregnant immigrants, Mendoza said.\n\nThe city of San Francisco already has Healthy San Francisco, which provides health insurance provides health services to uninsured residents who make up to $54,000 a year, regardless of whether they are documented. And last week, Los Angeles County launched its $61 million \u201cMy Health LA\u201d plan, a no-cost health plan for residents who cannot get health insurance, including the city\u2019s undocumented residents.\n\nThe District of Columbia has the Healthcare Alliance program, which provides health care for low-income people, regardless of immigration status. But because the program does not offer mental health and substance abuse treatment, it does not meet minimum standards for health insurance as mandated by the ACA, according to La Clinica\u2019s Joachin. The program also is quite complicated, with myriad rules and regulations that make it tricky to access, Joachin said.\n\nOther states rely on a patchwork system of safety-net providers, including public and not-for-profit hospitals, migrant health centers and community health centers like La Clinica which provide primary care to underserved communities, according to a Hastings Center report on undocumented immigrants. Illinois, for example, which has the nation\u2019s fifth-largest Latino population, provides coverage for all low-income children under 19, even if they are undocumented.\n\nIn some states, such as Maryland, the quality of care an uninsured immigrant can receive will vary greatly across counties, said Democratic Delegate Ana Sol Gutierrez, a Democrat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to understand why we prohibit people from buying health insurance,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of crazy. I\u2019m not saying (undocumented people) should have the free coverage. I\u2019m sure many of them would be able to pay.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This piece comes to us courtesy of Stateline.
