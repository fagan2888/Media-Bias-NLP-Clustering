TIGTA, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the US Government Accountability Office have acknowledged that, she wrote.\n\nThe IRS estimates that $15.6 billion (23.8 percent) of EITC payments were issued in error in fiscal year 2015.\n\nTIGTA is required to audit the agency\u2019s compliance with requirements to report improper payments in federal programs. EITC happens to rank as a high-risk program, and it\u2019s the only IRS program that the OMB considers high priority with regard to improper payments.\n\nThe report indicates that federal requirements consider a program to have significant risk if its gross annual improper payments exceed both 1.5 percent of program outlays and $10 million of all program or activity payments, or exceed $100 million at any percent of program outlays.\n\nTrending {{item['sft-title']}}\n\nWhile the IRS did provide the necessary information, the agency failed to report an improper payment rate of less than 10 percent. Reporting of that failure rate is a federal requirement.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch-22: The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 gave the IRS more tools to reduce the improper payments, the report states. But it didn\u2019t expand the agency\u2019s authority to make the corrections.\n\n\u201cWithout this authority, the IRS continues to be unable to address the majority of potentially erroneous EITC claims it identifies,\u201d the report states.\n\nBut those errors aren\u2019t the type the IRS has error-correction authority over when a tax return is processed. So, the agency could audit the claims, but that costs more than handling the claim with error-correction authority, and limited resources hamper how many audits can be done anyway. Besides, the agency has to allocate those limited resources \u201camong the various segments of taxpayer noncompliance to provide a balanced tax enforcement program,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe EITC claims, however, apparently aren\u2019t the extent of the issue. According to the report, there are \u201cnumerous indicators\u201d that improper payments may exist in other refundable tax credit programs.\n\nIn 2014, the OMB declared that all refundable credits are subject to federal requirements because they are funds paid out by the federal government. So, the US Treasury Department required the IRS to evaluate the risk of improper payments in the Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC) and the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC).\n\nTIGTA did its own estimates of potential improper payments for both credits, arriving at $5.7 billion (24.2 percent) in ACTC improper payments and $1.8 billion (30.7 percent) in AOTC improper payments. TIGTA concluded that both credit programs exceed federal requirements for what constitutes significant risk.\n\nBut the IRS, despite its own data, still considers the risk of improper payments for the ACTC and AOTC as low, the report states. Though the agency is revamping its risk-assessment process for the ACTC, it\u2019s not including a quantitative assessment for improper payment risk, TIGTA reports. Without that, \u201cwe believe that the IRS will be unable to effectively assess the improper payment risk for the ACTC and other refundable tax credits,\u201d the report states.\n\nIn her April letter, Gillis said TIGTA\u2019s math in calculating the AOTC and ACTC potential payment errors was correct, but the methodology used differs from the one used to calculate the EITC improper payment rate. The agency and Treasury are working with the OMB to devise \u201cconsistent compliance analytics\u201d for the EITC and other credit programs, she said.\n\nThe agency is using every tax administration tool and technique available, and is \u201cvigorously exploring additional data sources and partners to verify claim eligibility, deter overclaims, and reduce payment errors,\u201d Gillis said.\n\nIn FY 2015, the OMB set up an interagency group to assess the improper payment risk in all payments from the Premium Tax Credit budget fund account. The Federally Funded Research and Development Center is helping the IRS develop a risk-assessment process aimed at interagency coordination and a comprehensive risk assessment that considers account activities by the Affordable Care Act insurance exchanges, the US Department of Health and Human Services, and the IRS. According to the IRS, an update of the status and preliminary results of the comprehensive risk assessment will be included in the FY 2016 Agency Financial Report.\n\nA legislative proposal by the IRS and the Treasury\u2019s assistant secretary for tax policy seeks more error authority, and the IRS requested that authority as part of its FY 2017 budget. The proposal would give the Treasury Department the authority to permit the IRS to correct errors in the following situations:\n\nTaxpayer information doesn\u2019t match government information, such as W-2 forms.\n\nA taxpayer has maxed out the lifetime limit for claiming a deduction or credit.\n\nA taxpayer fails to include required documentation.\n\nAs of February, the IRS hadn\u2019t been given the additional error-correction authority, the report states.", "article_metadata": {"foaf": {"name": "Terry Sheridan"}, "dcterms.title": "IRS Lacks Authority to Fix Erroneous EITC Claims", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "IRS"}}, "og": {"site_name": "AccountingWEB", "title": "IRS Lacks Authority to Fix Erroneous EITC Claims", "url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/irs-lacks-authority-to-fix-erroneous-eitc-claims", "image": "http://www.accountingweb.com/sites/default/files/styles/media_medium/public/irs_headquartersskyhobo.jpg?itok=STaeMX2G", "updated_time": "2016-05-24T18:33:00+00:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/irs-lacks-authority-to-fix-erroneous-eitc-claims", "card": "summary", "title": "IRS Lacks Authority to Fix Erroneous EITC Claims"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#dce6eb", "dcterms.identifier": "http://www.accountingweb.com/tax/irs/irs-lacks-authority-to-fix-erroneous-eitc-claims", "dcterms.creator": "Terry Sheridan", "dcterms.date": "2016-05-24T18:33+00:00", "dcterms.language": "en", "msapplication-TileImage": "/sites/all/themes/awus/favicon-152.png", "dcterms.type": "Text", "sift": {"targeting": "[{\"key\":\"tag\",\"value\":[\"TIGTA\",\"Tax credit\"]},{\"key\":\"type\",\"value\":\"Article\"},{\"key\":\"subtopic\",\"value\":\"IRS\"},{\"key\":\"topic\",\"value\":[\"IRS\",\"Tax\"]},{\"key\":\"url\",\"value\":\"node_26813\"},{\"key\":\"status\",\"value\":\"live\"},{\"key\":\"homepage\",\"value\":\"0\"},{\"key\":\"user\",\"value\":\"out\"},{\"key\":\"CxSegments\",\"value\":\"\"}]"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-24T13:38:04-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-24T13:56:00-05:00"}, "cXenseParse": {"sft-section": "IRS", "sft-tag": "TIGTA", "sft-date": "May 24th 2016", "sft-type": "Article", "sft-topic": "Tax", "recs": {"category": "Article", "articleid": "node-26813", "publishtime": "2016-05-24T13:38:04:000Z"}, "sft-author": "Terry Sheridan", "sft-title": "IRS Lacks Authority to Fix Erroneous EITC Claims"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "TIGTA did its own estimates of potential improper payments for both credits, arriving at $5.7 billion (24.2 percent) in ACTC improper payments and $1.8 billion (30.7 percent) in AOTC improper payments.\nEITC happens to rank as a high-risk program, and it\u2019s the only IRS program that the OMB considers high priority with regard to improper payments.\nTIGTA is required to audit the agency\u2019s compliance with requirements to report improper payments in federal programs.\n\u201cWithout this authority, the IRS continues to be unable to address the majority of potentially erroneous EITC claims it identifies,\u201d the report states.\nBillions of dollars in potentially wrong Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) claims are ignored annually because the IRS lacks the authority to correct the errors, according to a new report."}
