It has kept consumer prices high and download speeds slow and has arguably cost the state jobs.\n\nThe bill was passed when the general public was years away from using terms like \u201cgigabit.\u201d Similar to other laws across the country enacted at the same time, SB 152 was pushed by large telecommunications companies as a way to restrict future municipal broadband efforts.\n\nAt the time, bill proponents said the laws were intended to limit government from taking on the private sector, saying it was unfair to let tax-supported entities compete with tax-paying businesses.\n\nThe legislation, they said, would protect taxpayers from funding risky municipal broadband schemes and allow the free market to work without government intervention.\n\n\u201cPure and simple, it was a statute written to limit competition,\u201d said Ken Fellman, a Denver attorney who specializes in telecom issues and has been fighting against SB 152 for years. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want government to compete directly or indirectly. There are millions of dollars in private capital that haven\u2019t come to Colorado because of this statutue.\u201d\n\nOnly now is CenturyLink promising to bring superfast broadband service to a \u201chigh percentage\u201d of Denver by next year. (It is doubtful that service will be available in poorer quarters of the city like Globeville or Westwood.)\n\nColorado\u2019 s law, however, let communities opt out with a vote. Some states with similar types of legislation cannot undo the stranglehold so easily.\n\nSo far, every Colorado community that has put the question on the ballot has succeeded. Centennial and Montrose are recent examples. Boulder is expected to ask its voters in November.\n\nThe bill appeared to create a democratic process, but it really presented an obstacle.\n\nCampaign finance laws prohibit cities from raising money or advocating for an issue once it\u2019s on the ballot. That gave telecom companies an advantage.\n\nIn 2009, when Longmont asked voters for the exemption to build out its broadband network, city officials were stunned when telecom giants spent $192,228 to defeat the measure compared to the proponents\u2019 $95. It was the most money spent in an election in Longmont\u2019s history.\n\nThe city came back again in 2011 and was successful, even though the same group spent $419,629 in an effort to defeat the initiative. In 2013, voters approved a $45.3 million bond to bring the network to every home and business in the city.\n\nFiber optics allow data to be transmitted nearly at the speed of light or one gigabit per second (1,000 megabits per second or Mbps) \u2014 roughly 100 times faster than typical download speeds today.\n\nSteve Elliott, a Longmont blogger, was one of the first users on the system and clocked his download speed at 739.66 Mbps compared to 26.08 Mbps from cable. And he is paying $49.95 a month compared to $72 a month for cable broadband.\n\n\u201cFolks, this is fast,\u201d he said in a blog post, comparing his download to a road race between a Vespa motor scooter and a Bonneville race car.\n\nLongmont\u2019s network is being built in six phases and is expected to be completed in 2017. The initial price is the cheapest rate in the country for such a fast system and discounts will be available for low-income families or people with disabilities, said Tom Roiniotis, general manager of Longmont Power & Communications.\n\nSB 152 created a barrier for the city-owned utility from completing the network that had been in the works since 1997, he said. Now, the city expects to reap the benefits of becoming Colorado\u2019s first \u201cgig city.\u201d\n\n\u201cMore businesses believe (high-speed broadband) is critical for their ability to compete, particularly on a global stage,\u201d he said. \u201cCities like Longmont could wait for the incumbent providers to upgrade \u2026 or we could do it ourselves. \u201c\n\nRoiniotis said no tax money was used to build the system. Funding came through the city-owned utility that operates as an enterprise fund, meaning it does not operate using tax dollars but instead generates its own revenue.\n\n\u201cThe bonds are being backed by (Longmont Power & Communications) revenues,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cost of providing the broadband services will be covered by what we charge.\u201d\n\nNeighboring Boulder wants what Longmont has, though it doesn\u2019t have its own utility and would likely seek to partner with a provider. \u201cLongmont is going to eat our lunch,\u201d said Boulder Mayor Matt Appelbaum. \u201cThey are going to kill everyone.\u201d\n\nThe council will vote later this month to put the measure on the ballot. Already, the issue has the support of the Boulder Chamber, Appelbaum said.\n\nBoulder already has 100 miles of fiber-optic cable connecting government buildings, school district, the University of Colorado and federal labs. But the city cannot begin discussing using that cable because of the law.\n\nGoogle Fiber, which is putting in networks around the country and got requests from 1,300 cities, looked seriously at joining with Boulder\u2019s network but bypassed the city because of SB 152, Appelbaum said.\n\n\u201cThey realized we would have to go to voters and Comcast would fight them,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have at least brought competition. They need competition. There is no incentive to innovate or move to the next generation of service levels. Who is pushing them?\u201d\n\nSynthia Payne years ago saw the problem in trying to set up a website in Denver that would use high-speed broadband to allow musicians across the world to jam together in real time. Instead, she picked up her bags and moved to Kansas City, Kan., where Google Fiber was setting up a network, and where she created CyberJammer.net.\n\n\u201cWith music, we have to have it fast both ways, upload and download,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought this is a great opportunity to go and be part of this pioneering business model. The possibilities were really endless.\u201d\n\nCindy Parsons, spokeswoman for Comcast, defended the company\u2019s stance against municipal broadband systems.\n\n\u201cComcast does not believe that government-owned networks are a good use of municipal funds in areas where the private market is already providing services,\u201d she said in an e-mailed statement. \u201d To the extent such deployments occur, they should be targeted to unserved areas and managed as a commercial enterprise without subsidization and subject to the same rules as a private provider.\u201d\n\nShe added that \u201cgovernment entry into direct ownership of broadband facilities is risky and costly \u2014 especially at a time when other priorities, like transportation infrastructure, desperately need public funds. Building, maintaining, and upgrading a broadband network is a complex endeavor requiring enormous funds and experience. In case after case, localities and their citizens have found that building broadband networks has created severe financial hardship.\u201d\n\nSeveral cities around the country that have become \u201cgig cities\u201d are touting their systems as being catalysts for economic growth. Chattanooga, Tenn., used $111 million in federal stimulus money to complete a fiber-optic network over 600 square miles, offering 1 gigabit per second service to all businesses, residences and public and private institutions.\n\nChattanooga has added 1,000 new jobs over the past three years and is emerging as an incubator for tech startups, reports say. The New York Times said the signs of growth in Chattanooga are unmistakable.\n\nFCC chair Tom Wheeler wrote in a June blog post that Chattanooga was the poster child for the benefits of community broadband and the prime example of efforts to restrict them.\n\n\u201cCommercial broadband providers can pick and choose who to serve based on whether there is an economic case for it,\u201d Wheeler wrote. \u201cChattanooga believes that it has a duty to ensure that all of its citizens have affordable broadband Internet access.\u201d\n\nWheeler said the FCC should exercise \u201cits power to pre-empt state laws that ban or restrict competition from community broadband.\u201d\n\nIn communities that have put in broadband systems, prices have gone down and speeds have gone up, he said. \u201cNo wonder incumbent broadband providers want to legislate rather than innovate,\u2019 Wheeler said.\n\nThe statute created by SB 152 needs to go away. While civic and business leaders tout ambitious projects to connect the state with the rest of the world, Colorado is falling behind because of artificial constraints to broadband expansion.\n\nLongmont pioneers saw past all of that and pushed through, even in the face of well-financed opposition. A few other communities are starting to see the advantage of bucking SB 152.\n\nLongmont\u2019s Roiniotis says the question he hears almost constantly is, \u201cWhen am I going to get my gig?\u201d\n\nIt is a question the entire state should ask.\n\nE-mail Jeremy Meyer at jpmeyer @denverpost.com.
