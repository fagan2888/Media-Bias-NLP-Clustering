Four were in the home and three were in a detached garage, Kirby said.\n\nSheriff\u2019s dispatchers received multiple 911 calls and hang-ups about 8:30 a.m. from the home off U.S. 24, she said. Deputies went to the scene and determined there were possibly two armed suspects inside with an unknown number of victims.\n\nA SWAT team cleared the house.\n\nThe motive wasn\u2019t clear. One man involved in the invasion apparently left the scene. One suspect initially detained by deputies \u201chad nothing to do with it\u201d and was released, Kirby said.\n\nSunday night, deputies were seeking a third suspect. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when the suspect left the residence.\u201d\n\nThe Colorado State Patrol closed U.S. 24 for several hours and re-opened it shortly after sunset.\n\nHahn wasn\u2019t injured \u201cbut needed medical attention\u201d and received it before he was booked, Kirby said. Late Sunday, deputies were seeking information related to the case, urging calls to the sheriff\u2019s office at 719-390-5555.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "One jailed, another sought in Manitou home invasion and hostage-taking", "title": "One jailed, another sought in Manitou home invasion and hostage-taking", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/12/20/one-jailed-another-sought-in-manitou-home-invasion-and-hostage-taking/", "image": {"width": 384, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151220_080631_Hahn.jpg", "height": 470}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151220_080631_Hahn.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-20T13:02:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T23:38:18+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Seven residents of the home west of Manitou Springs in Cascade were safe and unharmed, sheriff department spokeswoman Jacqueline Kirby said.\nLate Sunday, deputies were seeking information related to the case, urging calls to the sheriff\u2019s office at 719-390-5555.\nDeputies went to the scene and determined there were possibly two armed suspects inside with an unknown number of victims.\nHahn wasn\u2019t injured \u201cbut needed medical attention\u201d and received it before he was booked, Kirby said.\nEl Paso County authorities jailed one person, let one go and are looking for others after an armed home invasion west of Colorado Springs Sunday morning that led to a hostage situation."}
