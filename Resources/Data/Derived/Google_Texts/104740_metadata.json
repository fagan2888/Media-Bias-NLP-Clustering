The searchable directory allows users to find tax professionals with credentials and select qualifications.\n\nAt the time of filing this report, all tax preparers advertising on Mshale after February 1 are listed on the IRS database. Of the more than 140 million tax returns filed last year, more than half were prepared with the help of a paid return preparer, according to the IRS.\n\nIRS Commissioner John Koskinen said in a statement that those appearing on the database have completed the requirements for the voluntary IRS Annual Filing Season Program (AFSP) and have valid 2015 Preparer Tax Identification Numbers (PTIN). Koskinen said taxpayers should make sure their tax preparer has a valid PTIN and includes it on the tax return.\n\nHowever, tax return preparers with PTINs who are not attorneys, CPAs, enrolled agents or AFSP participants are not included in the directory, nor are volunteer tax return preparers who offer free services.\n\nObamacare and your Taxes\n\nNew this year for those filing taxes are the requirements of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) aka Obamacare that requires everyone to have health care coverage. The directory can be a resource for taxpayers who may want to get help from tax professionals on the Affordable Care Act tax provisions that affect returns filed this year.\u201cTaxpayers can also look to these tax professionals for help if they have questions about the new health care provisions on this year\u2019s tax forms,\u201d said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen.\n\nThe IRS searchable database which can be searched using the name, city, state and zip code of attorneys, CPAs, enrolled agents can be found here: http://irs.treasury.gov/rpo/rpo.jsf.\n\n(No Ratings Yet)\n\nLoading...\n\n0 0", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://mshale.com/2015/02/06/irs-launches-directory-federal-tax-return-preparers/", "type": "article", "image": "http://mshale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/irs_horiz.png", "site_name": "Mshale", "title": "IRS launches directory of federal tax return preparers"}, "article": {"tag": "IRS", "published_time": "2015-02-06", "modified_time": "2015-02-06", "author": "http://mshale.com/author/tom/"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde8e1\"", "article_summary": "IRS launches directory of federal tax return preparersThe Internal Revenue Service has launched a new online directory of tax return preparers just as the tax filing season has kicked into gear.\nHowever, tax return preparers with PTINs who are not attorneys, CPAs, enrolled agents or AFSP participants are not included in the directory, nor are volunteer tax return preparers who offer free services.\nKoskinen said taxpayers should make sure their tax preparer has a valid PTIN and includes it on the tax return.\nAt the time of filing this report, all tax preparers advertising on Mshale after February 1 are listed on the IRS database.\nThe searchable directory allows users to find tax professionals with credentials and select qualifications."}
