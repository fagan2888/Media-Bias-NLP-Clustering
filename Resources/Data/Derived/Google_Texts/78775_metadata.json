Since large insurance companies have few incentives aligning their interests with consumers, costs have continued to rise while user experience doesn\u2019t improve.\n\n\u201cWhen you buy health insurance off the shelf, it\u2019s kind of a one size fits all. There\u2019s not much guidance in terms of care and budgeting, and the online experience is very much out of the \u201990s,\u201d says Scott Raney of Redpoint, who recently participated in Collective Health\u2018s Series B.\n\nInvestors have backed 55 startups since 2011 in an effort to bring the health insurance market up to speed with current consumer expectation, and lately they\u2019re picking up the pace.\n\nIn 2014, heath insurance companies raised $308 million across 32 venture rounds, according to CrunchBase data \u2014 a 250% increase from the $88 million raised in 2013 and a 556% increase from 2012\u2019s total. Founders Fund and NEA are among a growing list of firms that have closed multiple deals in the space, and Oscar, the new age health insurance provider that\u2019s already one of New York\u2019s top-funded startups, is reportedly in talks to raise even more at a $1 billion valuation.\n\nDriving this funding frenzy is the influx of machine readable data made available by the Affordable Care Act back in March of 2010. At its core, the ACA mandated and lowered the price of health care coverage for Americans, but for regulatory purposes it converted all health plans from free-form text into a machine readable format.\n\n\u201cThe data that\u2019s out there now is making it easier for organizations to personalize and optimize healthcare, but it\u2019s also pushing more of these decisions downstream,\u201d says Rick Yang at NEA.\n\n\u201cA lot of these higher deductible plans require consumers to take a lot more responsibility, and you really have to be able to understand the data behind it,\u201d Yang says.\n\nNEA led last month\u2019s $32 million Series B for Collective Health, one startup that\u2019s helping employers make sense of the health care data overload.\n\nWith Collective Health, employers can build custom insurance plans for their employees instead of purchasing a one-size-fits-all plan from a large provider, such as Blue Cross. Self-insurance is not a new concept \u2014 94% of companies with more than 5,000 employees already self-fund their health plans \u2014 but Collective Health is making it possible for much smaller organizations to adopt this model and manage administrative work.\n\n\u201cAccess to health records and health claims history is really difficult to get, and difficult to understand \u2014 but if you know what your employees claim history might look like, and know that certain types of healthcare costs crop up more than others, you can craft your own health plan to be more responsive to your company\u2019s needs,\u201d says Scott Nolan, a partner at Founders Fund and investor in both Collective Health and Oscar. Nolan adds that most companies see a 10% decrease in healthcare costs after switching to self funding.\n\nEmployers aren\u2019t the only group in need of a health insurance upgrade. For the 53 million Americans (a third of the labor force) whose insurance is not provided by their employer, investors are searching for a different solution.\n\nNEA is betting on Stride Health, a personal health insurance recommendation engine that closed a $2.4 million seed round in January.\n\n\u201cTypically as a consumer, you\u2019re picking from 40 to 60 health plans in a given region, and they\u2019re all laid out in a vocabulary you don\u2019t speak and priced according to a premium \u2014 but that\u2019s not the price you really need. You need to evaluate how much you\u2019re going to use,\u201d says Noah Lang, founder of Stride.\n\nStride creates a care forecast and prices your personal care on every plan, coupled with the coverage price, to show you the total cost of owning that plan \u2014 your care plus your coverage.\n\n\u201cThe ACA put consumer decision making at the forefront. So now the issue is, how do we take this universal jargon and make it comprehensible in the context of every individual\u2019s life in the way that my social stream on Facebook and the ads I see are personalized for me,\u201d says Lang.\n\nLang says that Stride users average 12 to 15 minutes to get through both the recommendation and enrollment process. To put this in perspective, Covered California\u2019s average time to completion is an hour and forty-eight minutes, and most people couple that with spending an hour on the phone.\n\nRick Yang, who led NEA\u2019s deal for Stride, sees a big opportunity around the \u201cconsumerization of healthcare,\u201d as he calls it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a big thesis around the consumerization of the enterprise \u2014 but you\u2019re really seeing the consumerization of everything now, and some of the most interesting investment opportunities exist at the edges of a lot of these different sectors \u2014 data, healthcare, consumer mobile, and the freelance economy,\u201d Yang says.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/author/christine-magee/\" title=\"Posts by Christine Magee\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">Christine Magee</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/christinekmagee\" rel=\"external\">@christinekmagee</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "p": {"domain_verify": "6189ff68ce30e30f12b40b3b40873027"}, "twitter": {"description": "Venture capitalists are on a mission to heal the ailing U.S. healthcare system, and big data might just be the right prescription.
