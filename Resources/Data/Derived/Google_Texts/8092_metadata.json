Baden, special to CNN\n\n(CNN) - Most modern people tend to distinguish between the wrathful God of the Old Testament and the merciful God of the New Testament.\n\nIn our age, the merciful God reigns - or so we like to think.\n\nBut every so often, stories or books or natural disasters summon visions of a wrathful God, and nowhere is that more in evidence than in the biblical story of the Flood, now brutally depicted in Darren Aronofsky\u2019s new film \u201cNoah.\u201d\n\nWith our notion of a God who loves us all individually, especially the little children, we struggle with a deity who would wipe out all of humanity. Surely there were many innocent people, children, who died in the Flood?\n\nBut let\u2019s be clear: This is our problem, not the Bible\u2019s.\n\nAccording to the biblical story of the Flood, it was not individuals who were wicked; it was humanity as a whole, a wickedness encoded in humanity\u2019s very nature. Young, old, male, female, \u201cevery plan devised by humanity\u2019s mind was nothing but evil all the time,\u201d says the Book of Genesis.\n\nNor is the Flood intended to eradicate humanity\u2019s wickedness so that we might begin anew as a peaceful species, as the film \u201cNoah\u201d seems to suggest.\n\nIn the Bible, Noah and his descendants don\u2019t promise to behave differently after the flood. Rather, God learns to accept their inherently evil nature: \u201cNever again will I doom the earth because of humanity, since the devisings of humanity\u2019s mind are evil from their youth.\u201d\n\nWe are who we are.\n\nIn fact, according to the Bible, the reason that God accepts human nature is because we are the only species that can give him what he wants \u2014 which, in the view of Genesis, is bloody, burned animal sacrifices. (So much for the pro-vegetarian angle of Aronofsky\u2019s film.)\n\nMORE ON CNN: Does God have a prayer in Hollywood?\n\nThe God of the Old Testament is not uniquely protective of children. After all, this is the same deity who commands the Israelites to slaughter their enemies, \u201cman and woman, young and old.\u201d\n\nThe same God who accepts without comment Jephthah\u2019s sacrifice of his own daughter, who allows children to be mauled by a bear for taunting one of his prophets, who threatens Israel with such devastating famine that they will be forced to eat their own infants.\n\nInnocent lives are rarely a moral problem for Israel\u2019s God.\n\nConsider the debate between Abraham and God over the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham asks his maker, \u201cWill you sweep away the innocent along with the guilty?\u201d\n\nAbraham succeeds in talking God down to sparing the city for the sake of 10 innocent lives. When the city is then destroyed anyway, we are left to surmise that there must have been fewer than 10 good people there. But there might have been nine \u2014 and they burned with the rest.\n\nAronofsky must have recognized our modern moral conundrum: His depiction of humanity outside the family of Noah is almost entirely negative, so that we feel very little compassion for them. Even as they clamber for space on mountaintops as the waters rise.\n\nMORE ON CNN: Noah's Ark discovery raises flood of questions\n\nThe one exception to humanity\u2019s general wickedness, a young woman who does not make it onto the ark, stands in for all the innocents swept away in the Flood.\n\nBut how innocent is she, really?\n\nThe film hews close to the Christian notion of original sin: Noah states quite forcefully that humans have all been corrupted since the expulsion from the Garden.\n\nFrom that perspective, there are no truly innocent humans, regardless of how innocently they may behave.\n\nIn the film, the only real innocents are the animals. They remain so, one character says, because they behave as they did in Eden. Which, of course, is more than anyone can say for Adam and Eve. Notably, Aronofsky does not show any animals drowning or struggling for life, though they also must have.\n\nAgain, this is not a problem for the Old Testament: The animals are as inherently guilty as the humans. \u201cAll flesh\u201d \u2014 animals included \u2014 \u201chad corrupted its way on the earth,\u201d we are told in Genesis.\n\nSo, we have to separate our notion of innocence \u2014 and of God\u2019s nature \u2014 from that of the Old Testament authors.\n\nThe God of the Old Testament does not love humans; he barely tolerates them. The relationship is not one of affection but one of necessity and of obedience.\n\nWe are promised that there will never be another Flood because God wants and needs our sacrifices.\n\nThe family of the patriarchs is chosen out of all humanity not because they are somehow more righteous but so that they can exemplify correct obedience for the other nations of the world.\n\nIsrael is saved from Egypt not out of love but in order that they will be uniquely beholden to God and will serve him \u2014 again, with sacrifices \u2014 in the way that God most desires.\n\nIsrael\u2019s God is not a beneficent one. He is, in the words of his prophet Nahum, \u201ca passionate, avenging God; vengeful, and fierce in wrath.\u201d\n\nIt is not his job to keep us happy and comfortable; it is, rather, our job to make ourselves uncomfortable that he might be appeased.\n\nAnd yet there is no question that the Old Testament God is not the same God we know and worship today, in modern America.\n\nHow, then, do we, who still hold the Bible dear, reconcile our idea of God with God\u2019s actions, in the Flood story and elsewhere?\n\nOne possibility is simply to take the Bible at its word: All of humanity, and indeed all of the animals too, was wicked, and even Noah was not entirely righteous but only the most righteous of his wicked generation, as an ancient Jewish tradition stated.\n\nThe moral problem is then not why everyone perished, but why \u2014 as the movie version asks \u2014 anyone was saved at all.\n\nAnother possibility is to attribute a shift in personality to the deity: from wrathful to merciful, in line with the division between the Old and New Testaments.\n\nFor those who believe in a new dispensation with the arrival of Jesus, this option seems relatively easy. For those who don\u2019t, not so much.\n\nA third choice is to fall back \u2014 quite easily \u2014 on the essential unknowability of God.\n\nWe are not granted the same understanding or perception as is the deity. Which is to say: We have to give him the benefit of the doubt.\n\nWhichever of these paths one takes \u2014 and there are surely others \u2014 we are struggling with the same basic problem, trying to find some solution that will bring the God of the Old Testament into line with our modern God.\n\nIn other words, it is our changing concept of God, over two millennia, that is responsible for the moral dilemma. It\u2019s our problem, not the Bible\u2019s.\n\nJoel S.
