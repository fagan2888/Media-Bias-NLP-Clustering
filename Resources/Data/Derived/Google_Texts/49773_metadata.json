Welcome back! (Photo: AP Photo/The Advocate-Messenger, Clay Jackson )\n\nGood morning, class. Remember, no running. Please take your seats and take out your textbooks.\n\nIt has been a long time since most of us have had a first day of school. But anyone who has every had one can remember the sights and sounds, the return to the school year's rituals and routines, the mixture of nervousness and excitement and the sense of the new school year as something familiar and something new at the same time.\n\nToday is the first day of classes for students in districts throughout the region, which also means it's the first day of school for thousands of teachers, school administrators and support staff. It's a return to school routines for bus drivers, educational aides and, not least of all, parents.\n\nOf course, this also means, regardless of what the calendar says, that summer is over \u2014 not that it's felt a whole lot like summer around here lately.\n\nSome questions for today that occurred to us: In the social media age, do kids still ask, \"How was your summer?\" In lieu of a \"How I spent my summer vacation\" essay, can students simply submit a link to their Instagram feeds? Given how over-scheduled and over-extended some kids are, would the \"How I spent my summer vacation\" essay have to be novel-length?\n\nIt's a different time. But we suspect the nervous energy of the first day of school is something timeless.\n\nWelcome back.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://wdhne.ws/1pCkWw3", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Welcome back to school, Wisconsin.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Herald Media", "description": "Welcome back to school, Wisconsin.", "title": "First day of school excitement is timeless: Our View", "url": "http://www.wausaudailyherald.com/story/opinion/2014/09/02/first-day-school-excitement-timeless-view/14822807/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/wausaudailyherald.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Welcome back to school, Wisconsin.", "title": "First day of school excitement is timeless: Our View", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b7f708985f77c50e3f101b4202cee963e7af0b3a/c=712-0-3544-2832&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Wausau/2014/08/29/-apcbrd08-25-2014crescent1b00420140824imga04school25s.jpg11j5.jpg", "creator": "@wausauherald", "site": "@wausauherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=884268453", "fb": {"app_id": 187427251271455}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbe63\"", "article_summary": "Tuesday is the first day of school for many Wisconsin school districts.\nToday is the first day of classes for students in districts throughout the region, which also means it's the first day of school for thousands of teachers, school administrators and support staff.\nBut we suspect the nervous energy of the first day of school is something timeless.\nIt's a return to school routines for bus drivers, educational aides and, not least of all, parents.\nIt has been a long time since most of us have had a first day of school."}
