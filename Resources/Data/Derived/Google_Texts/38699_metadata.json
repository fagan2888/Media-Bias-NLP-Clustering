Accordingly, to cash in on the likely boom in this space, we are keen on more acquisitions in the technology side of the healthcare and pharma markets,\u201d Suresh Venkatachari, founder- chairman of the Silicon Valley-based company told PTI from its headquarters.\n\nHe further said that going forward the focus will be healthcare and pharma sectors as the company sees strong opportunity in the cloud market, which is getting matured \u2013 Amazon reported USD 5 billion from cloud last year and so is Microsoft, whose cloud business is also jumping \u2013 and growth could be through both organic or inorganic routes.\n\nWhen asked about funding side, he said all the past three acquisitions were not funded by debt. \u201cBut having said that if a good deal comes by, we will not mind a debt-funded deal,\u201d he said, adding that there is good cash flow now and no debt on the books of 8K Miles now.\n\nFree Download: \u2018A beginner\u2019s guide to app store optimization\u2019\n\nAccording to PTI, the company has Rs 20 crore cash in hand now. It can be noted that in April, 8K Miles, which is the only listed cloud computing company in the country, acquired Cintel Systems of the US, which develops user interfaces for desktops, mobile and tablets across a wide range of industry segments with a focus on healthcare providers, for USD 3.75 million in a cash and stock deal.\n\nIn March, it acquired Mindprint, the Canadian clinical research software startup, for USD 4,00,000 to strengthen its presence in the pharmaceutical vertical. Late last year, it also took over SERJ Solutions, a company into EHR consulting, managed services and custom application development for healthcare providers.\n\n8K Miles counts Amazon, HP Microsoft and other tech biggies as clients and is also ramping up its senior management personnel to cash in on Obamacare boom. Accordingly, Venkatachari said the company has hired two senior healthcare specialists from General Electric.\n\nImage Credit : Shutterstock\n\nRelated Stories :\n\nObama gifts \u201cStartup Visas\u201d to foreign-born entrepreneurs in the US\n\nHealthcare IT solutions provider, hCentive opens R&D center in Noida\n\nhCentive, an Indian startup, is strengthening ObamaCare in the United States\n\nWell, that dream could become a reality if you get accepted into the newly launched BC-GSV Accelerator 2016.
