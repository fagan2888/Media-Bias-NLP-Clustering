Then state and local taxes, and, finally, we can live on Ramen noodles after the mortgage, utilities and other living expenses. Is this a great system or what?\" Broyles said.\n\n\n\nBroyles' annual income is about $100,000, which means he earns too much to qualify for a federal tax credit to reduce his monthly premium payments. But even people who get those subsidies can feel sticker shock.\n\nTom Thomas, a 62-year-old retiree from Ohio, said he was \"pretty damn upset\" to learn that his current Obamacare plan costs, if he had re-enrolled for 2016, would have risen from $68 per month to $252 per month after his subsidy.\n\nEven after he switched plans to a cheaper option, Thomas will be paying $179 per month after his subsidy in 2016. His annual cost, from just premiums alone, will be more than 8 percent of his annual income of $24,000.\n\n\"Ouch!\" he said.\n\nInsurers are sensitive to such concerns. The New York-based insurer Oscar, which was started up to take advantage of the Obamacare market, just introduced a \"Help Me Choose My Plan\" feature on its website. The feature asks consumers four questions about their use of specialists, chronic conditions, plans for medical procedures and prescription drug use, and then presents plan options.\n\nMario Schlosser, CEO and co-founder of Oscar, said the tool was designed to deal with the \"difficult and often overwhelming task\" of predicting the \"variables of your future health needs.\"\n\nOscar wanted the tool to help consumers \"minimize their out-of-pocket costs,\" Schlosser said. It also is part of its attempt to provide customers with \"a simple, transparent experience\" so they will continue choosing Oscar, he said.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Many Obamacare customers pay more than 10 percent of their incomes toward premiums and out-of-pocket costs, an analysis finds.", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, health insurance, HealthCare.gov, Affordable Care Act", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Many Obamacare customers pay more than 10 percent of their incomes toward coverage costs, a report found.", "title": "Obamacare plans put big dent in customers' wallets", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/24/obamacare-plans-put-big-dent-in-customers-wallets.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/11/12/103164645-GettyImages-495382986.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many Obamacare customers pay more than 10 percent of their incomes toward coverage costs, a report found.", "creator": "@_DanMangan", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/24/obamacare-plans-put-big-dent-in-customers-wallets.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/11/12/103164645-GettyImages-495382986.1910x1000.jpg"}, "title": "Obamacare plans put big dent in customers' wallets", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "Health Insurance, Health Insurance, Health Care, Obamacare, US: News, Politics, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-12-24T10:33:21-0500", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Insurance", "modified_time": "2015-12-24T12:42:22-0500", "tag": "Politics"}, "pageNodeId": 103263412, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "article_summary": "His annual cost, from just premiums alone, will be more than 8 percent of his annual income of $24,000.\nAfter paying for his Obamacare plan, as well as his Social Security and Medicare withholding, \"we then get to start paying income tax on the roughly 70 percent that remains.\nEven after he switched plans to a cheaper option, Thomas will be paying $179 per month after his subsidy in 2016.\nBroyles' annual income is about $100,000, which means he earns too much to qualify for a federal tax credit to reduce his monthly premium payments.\nIt also is part of its attempt to provide customers with \"a simple, transparent experience\" so they will continue choosing Oscar, he said."}
