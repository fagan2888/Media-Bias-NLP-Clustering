Sioux Falls, SD

Hundreds of students from across the state put their engineering skills to the test at the Fifth Annual FIRST LEGO League Championships in Sioux Falls today.

Teams design LEGO robots to serve in a real life setting. This year's theme, "Nature’s Fury" prompts students to find ways their robotic LEGOs could help in time of disaster.

“One of the requirements is that they have to come up with a solution, an innovative solution to how they would maybe solve that real life world problem that they might see in their community or the world today,” South Dakota Robotics Association’s Kayla Hinsch said.

Finalist from today’s event will have the chance to go in to national and even world LEGO competitions.
