He wrapped up his evening Wednesday night at his own pace, moving slow enough to appear fatigued just five games into the season.\n\nPierce had just shot 3-for-15 against the Indiana Pacers. He missed layups, jumpers from his sweet spots and 3-pointers. His game shoes were jammed into large plastic container that had slots marked by number. They would go on to Toronto with the rest of the team Thursday night to start the Wizards\u2019 third set of back-to-back games in the first two weeks of the season.\n\nAmong the discussions around the league is length of season. The 37-year-old Pierce, not surprisingly, is ready for some changes. He\u2019s had enough back-to-back games.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather play every other day,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s tough man, especially when you play so many, 82 games. You fly \u2026 People don\u2019t understand the grind. You come home, you land at 2 o\u2019clock, people say, OK, you\u2019re getting eight hours rest. A lot of us eat when we land or we\u2019re up for a couple hours, so you don\u2019t go to bed until four, then you wake up and go to practice and got to pay the next night.\n\n\u201cSo, it\u2019s tough. Everybody has to do it but it\u2019s tough on your body, especially the older you get. None of this is easy. Coach is always saying winning is not easy and that\u2019s part of it. Maybe that\u2019s the reason for the injuries. So many injuries every year, lack of rest, lack of nutrition. There\u2019s a lot of things that can factor into that. Maybe it\u2019s something the NBA ought to look at in the long run. Who knows if it will change? But, uh, it\u2019s definitely a factor.\u201d\n\nThe Wizards opened on the road in Miami and Orlando. Earlier in the week, they played at New York before coming home to face Indiana. They wrap five of the first seven games on the road tonight in Indiana after being whalloped in Toronto, 103-84, by a young, overlooked Raptors team. Pierce was 3-for-11 Friday night, making him 6-for-26 (23.1 percent) the last two games.\n\n\u201cIt was a good old-fashioned butt-whooping,\u201d coach Randy Wittman said.\n\nThe Wizards have a break coming up. They receive three days off following Saturday night\u2019s game against Indiana before hosting four consecutive home games with at least a day in between each.\n\nWashington has two more back-to-backs this month, giving it five in the opening four weeks of the season. In December, it has just two. In January the Wizards will play four back-to-backs. In February, two sets of consecutive games conspicuously grouped together at the end of the month. March only once and twice in April.\n\nIn order to eliminate them, there are two logical options: shorten the preseason or the number of regular-season games, the latter a common suggestion that has not gained much traction with the league.\n\n\u201cWe can shorten up preseason,\u201d Pierce said. \u201cFour preseason games. Start the second week of October regular season. Maybe that would help the schedule rid a lot of the back-to-backs. There certainly should be a limit on that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Among the discussions around the league is length of season.
