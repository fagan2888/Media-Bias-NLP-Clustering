The House-passed plan is due for a vote this morning in the Senate and it promises to be close. The main question, as new worries emerge in the middle about stiffing veterans, is whether Reid can keep liberal Democrats in line. The left wing of Reid\u2019s conference is sore about capitulations on demanded welfare extensions and other government spending initiatives. While the plan crafted by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and his Senate counterpart Patty Murray increases user fees for many Americans on things like air travel, it contains no tax hikes, per se. What will liberals want to go along with Reid\u2019s plan? The weeks to come will tell the tale.\n\nBAIER TRACKS: VETS KEY TO BUDGET BATTLE\u2026\u201cThe $6.2 billion dollars in \u2018savings\u2019 over the next 10 years in the Ryan-Murray budget agreement could be in jeopardy. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., made a compelling case on \u201cSpecial Report\u201d last night when she took the Center Seat on the panel. The Washington Post lays out the critics\u2019 case. It is a balancing act, but the battle lines are forming.\u201d \u2013 Bret Baier.\n\nFiscal flap - Hawkish Senate Republicans are none-too-pleased about the budget deal after veterans groups voiced their opposition over provisions that would cut retirement benefits for military retirees. Even moderates like Sens. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. and Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. are digging in to fight the package, calling the cuts \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Meanwhile, conservatives like Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., are standing tough against the deal for failing to address runaway government spending or reduce the debt. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, says he\u2019ll take it, though. The bill \u201cisn\u2019t everything I\u2019d hoped it would be, and it isn\u2019t what I would have written,\u201d Hatch said in a statement. \u201cBut sometimes the answer has to be \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d Fox News has more.\n\n[Federal debt increase since the start of 2011: $3.2 trillion (now $17.2 trillion)// Federal outlays for past three years (Oct. 1, 2010 through Sept. 30, 2013): $10.58 trillion. Sources: CBO, Treasury]\n\nHonor your word - Babette Maxwell, whose husband is an active duty naval officer and plans to soon retire after nearly 20 years spoke out against provisions in the Ryan-Murray deal that hit military retirement funds. In an appearance on \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d Maxwell told Megyn Kelly, \u201cThe fact remains that these are earned benefits, this is not a social welfare program, these are our earned benefits. We have paid in time, commitment to the military in order to have these earned benefits. These are promises that were made to us, some of us agreed to stay in the military longer, at Congressional bidding because the military needed us and we want them to honor their word.\u201d Watch the full interview.\n\n[A New WaPo/ABC News poll shows 50 percent of respondents favor the measure while 35 percent disapprove.]\n\nSUPER-SIZED WASTE - Congressional budget hawk Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., has released his annual waste book today. Among the outrageous items: $630,000 to increase Facebook likes, $415,000 on red wine in China, and the National Endowment for Humanities spending $914,000 to find love online. But Coburn hits hardest at military waste: \u201cThe Department of Defense (DOD) developed a plan this year to constrain pay and benefits for our brave men and women in uniform, who risk their lives to protect us from terrorists, for example, while at the same time continuing to pay the salary and other government benefits for the Fort Hood shooter, responsible for the worst terrorist attack on American soil since 9-11. DOD grounded the Air Force Thunderbirds and Navy Blue Angels, yet still spent $631.4 million to construct aircraft they never intend to fly. The Army National Guard spent $10 million on Superman movie tie-ins while plans were being made to cut the strength of the Guard by 8,000 soldiers, the real supermen and women who fight for truth, justice and the American way.\u201d\n\nBEHIND YOUR BACK: OBAMA HUDDLES WITH TECH CEOS - President Obama will meet in secret today with some of his top political benefactors, the heads of America\u2019s largest technology companies. At issue are two main topics: first, a court challenge that may end a key piece of the federal government\u2019s expansive spying system. The tech bosses are looking to get the upper hand in how to share user data with federal investigators seeking criminals and Islamist terrorists. The data-harvesting honchos at Apple, Google, Facebook and elsewhere want some predictability on how and when they will turn over to G-Men their most valuable asset: information about you. Also at issue is the crash landing of ObamaCare\u2019s online home. The White House is casting the session as a working session, but one supposes that the folks who made Obama\u2019s meteoric rise possible with their technology and money might want to know how the high-tech president has become the author of the most notable technical failure in American history. Washington Examiner has more. --Watch Fox: Correspondent Peter Doocy has the latest on a federal judge\u2019s ruling that the administration\u2019s spy program is running afoul of the fourth amendment.\n\n[WSJ: \u201cMr. Obama seems to view the NSA as some independent operation running on autopilot, but the programs that keep the country safe are his responsibility.\u201d]\n\nIT\u2019S JUST NOT OBAMACARE WITHOUT OBAMA - President Obama has not enrolled in his own entitlement program. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney told reporters, \u201cThe president will purchase insurance on the exchanges\u201d and that he would provide an update when he had one. He\u2019d better hurry since he and the first family need to be enrolled by Monday to make sure that they don\u2019t experience a coverage gap. Obama is not required to enroll through an online exchange like members of Congress and staffers who do not work for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. Obama is joining his program voluntarily in a show of solidarity with his constituents (and because of endless Republican carping). But it will be just that when he does: show. The president has a private physician and is followed everywhere by a medical team, items not covered by even the platinum plans of ObamaCare. Why the delay, then? Perhaps to avoid an embarrassing revelation about sky-high premiums. Keep your eyes peeled starting Friday afternoon for a turkey drop. Fox News has more.\n\n[\u201cIf [ObamaCare is] so great why isn't the president and the rest of the federal government on it?\u201d\u2014Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., on \u201cHannity\u201d]\n\nWider worries - House Oversight Committee Chairman Darell Issa, fresh off of his release of disconcerting data about the conduct of ObamaCare navigators[watch], tells Breitbart that the ObamaCare crash may mean not just the expected coverage gaps, but the loss of needed health care: \u201cFixing the challenges created for healthcare providers may not be possible. Tens of millions of people may not get quality healthcare over the next year or two, and that means lives could be lost.\u201d\n\nObamaCare a \u2018drag\u2019 - It\u2019s gay day for ObamaCare. The administration is targeting the gay community for ObamaCare today, announcing an enrollment push among the non-heterosexual world. At least they\u2019re not pandering. Oh, wait. From WaPo: \u201cSome of the pitches are decidedly less conventional. Wednesday Night Tea, a drag show in Shreveport, La., has started promoting the health-care law as part of its act.\u201d\n\nBlue crabs scuttle - From the Baltimore Sun: \u201cLess than two days after Gov. Martin O'Malley declared that the state's online insurance marketplace finally worked for most consumers, a server crashed Monday, the call center became overwhelmed and the governor announced he was bringing in another contractor to improve the website.\u201d\n\nBah, humbug - WSJ explains how insurers worry that the offer by some charities and hospitals to cover some premiums for patients facing coverage gaps because of ObamaCare could end up disrupting coverage for millions more Americans.\n\nOBAMA BELOW BUSH AT THE END OF YEAR FIVE - A new WaPo/ABC News poll shows President Obama\u2019s advantage over Republicans over handling the economy, formerly 15-points, has vanished. The president\u2019s 26 point advantage on who would better protect the middle-class has diminished to just six. Obama\u2019s job approval in the poll, which covers adults rather than registered voters, stood at 43 percent for the second month in a row. Obama ends 2013 with approvals lower than George W. Bush had in the poll at the end of his fifth year.\n\nWhy it matters: From writers Dan Balz and Scott Clement: \u201cLooking to 2014, voters are almost evenly divided in how they would cast their ballots in House races. Two months ago, Democrats held an eight-point advantage on the heels of the October government shutdown. Today it\u2019s just two points \u2014 47 percent to 45 percent. As a point of reference, shortly before Republicans made historic gains in the House in 2010, this \u201cgeneric ballot\u201d narrowly favored the Democrats.\u201d\n\nTOP TWEETS - @laurenashburn\u2019s top tweet pick for this morning: @ABCPolitics: \u201cA Drop in Opposition to Health Care Law Helps Stabilize a Struggling Obama http://t.co/QQQQ6ICn2i\u201d\n\n[Lauren Ashburn of \u201c#MEDIABUZZ\u201d tracks the Twitterverse every day in Top Twitter Talk.]\n\nVANITY FAIR LAMENTS INSUFFICIENCY OF BUSH HATE - Vanity Fair\u2019s Juli Weiner seems worried that young adults have stopped hating George W. Bush. Weiner catalogues how younger pop culture mavens have come to see Bush as a kindly sort, particularly through his hobby of painting. And using irony. And she has just had it. And, ugh! \u201cBush appreciated art; an appreciation of art implies humanity, according to the enlightened classes; by the transitive property, Bush has humanity. War-mongers: they\u2019re just like us!\u201d Weiner, who the Internet says graduated from college in 2010, doesn\u2019t fault \u201chipsters\u201d for failing to understand Bush\u2019s misdeeds since they are young and would be more likely to read about Bush\u2019s dog paintings and not his administration\u2019s policies on dealing with suspected Islamist militants.\n\nCHILL WARNING: EPA CLIMATE EXPERTS FRAUD - The massive fraud of former Environmental Protection Agency climate expert John Beale is raising questions from Congressional investigators over the agency\u2019s handling of the case. Beale will face sentencing this week for bilking the agency out of a million dollars and other benefits for the better part of a decade while claiming he was working with the CIA. Sentencing memos obtained by NBC News are providing new insights into the extent of the fraud and the failings of the EPA. The memos reveal the agency \u201cenabled\u201d Beale by failing to corroborate any of his false claims.\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...How did 15 percent of America\u2019s high schoolers end up on powerful stimulants for attention deficit disorder? How did the we achieve a diagnosis rate that the doctor who identified the disorder and fought to have it recognized called \u201ca national disaster of dangerous proportions?\u201d The NYT looks at the selling of the disorder by drug companies, first for kids and now adults, including through the help of one celebrity who is currently also pitching K Mart clothes, acne treatments and ObamaCare: \u201cNow targeting adults, Shire and two patient advocacy groups have recruited celebrities like the Maroon 5 musician Adam Levine for their marketing campaign, \u201cIt\u2019s Your A.D.H.D. \u2013 Own It.\u201d\n\n[Ahem - NYT: \u201cThe British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline will no longer pay doctors to promote its products and will stop tying compensation of sales representatives to the number of prescriptions doctors write\u2026\u201d]\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Brian Schweitzer embraces the mantle of Democratic populism, lamenting the \u201ccorporatist\u201d tendencies of President Obama and 2016 Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton. Democrats from the party\u2019s William Jennings Bryan branch are looking for a hero now that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has bowed to Clinton. Schweitzer invited speculation, talking up Iowa and New Hampshire visits. With Obama meeting today with some of his biggest corporate patrons, it\u2019s a vibe that may resonate. Said Schweitzer: \u201cThe question that we have is, will it be the Hillary that leads the progressives, or is it the Hillary that says, \u2018I\u2019m already going to win the Democratic nomination, and so I can shift hard right on Day 1.\u2019 We can\u2019t afford any more hard right. We had eight years of George Bush. Now we\u2019ve had five years of Obama, [who], I would argue, in many cases has been a corporatist.\u201d\n\nThe reality of the rift - New Republic Senior Editor Noam Scheiber considers how a broad definition of populism is at the heart of the debate between the more liberal and centrist factions of the Democratic Party. \u201c\u2026what I think most liberals today mean\u2014by the term \u2018populist\u2019 is rather literal: a politician or interest group whose power derives primarily from their appeal to lots of ordinary \u2026individuals rather than a handful of powerful patrons, or the interest groups that represent them\u2026when powerful economic interests are involved, the burden of proof should fall on self-interested elites rather than popular opinion\u2026 That\u2019s not a trivial difference. It\u2019s the schism that\u2019s increasingly defining the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nHOT KEY: \u2018REPUBLICAN CIVIL WAR\u2019 - Slate\u2019s David Weigel points out that NYT\u2019s Jennifer Steinhauer has written pieces using former Rep. Bob Dold, R-Ill., as a moderate who is bucking the conservative trend in his party and, wait for it, a reformed conservative who has abandoned \u201cincendiary\u201d rhetoric. That\u2019s a busy 17 months for the former suburban Chicago congressman, from moderate to incendiary to regretful extremist.\n\n[Ed note: If you have to churn out \u201cGOP civil war\u201d stories as often as the NYT does, you\u2019re going run through all the Republican members of the House eventually. And former members. And candidates.]\n\nDO-OVER POSSIBLE IN VIRGINIA AG RACE - Democrat-dominated Fairfax County delivered another trove of previously uncounted votes for Democrat Mark Herring as the recount in Virginia\u2019s attorney general\u2019s race got underway. Most of the rest of the commonwealth begins its recount today, with several counties likely to deliver votes for Republican Mark Obenshain. (Officials tell WaPo several thousand votes are in play because machines failed to register the votes correctly.) But one former statewide-elected Republican tells Fox News First that this could be far from over. Once the recount is done, the loser has a chance to contest the result and throw the decision to the legislature in Richmond. Republicans have the votes to deliver the office to Obenshain, but might be squeamish about reversing the popular vote, however controversial the count. But lawmakers have another choice: they can order a do-over, demanding that the election be thrown out and held again. \u201cIn this environment, it would be hard to see a Republican losing,\u201d the former official said. With Republicans worried about having no executive-branch checks or oversight on Gov.-elect Terry McAuliffe, they might be inclined.\n\nHACKLES UP OVER WISCONSIN \u2018JOHN DOE\u2019 PROBES - Republicans in Wisconsin are speaking out about anonymous probes of conservatives ahead of next year\u2019s elections. Republican state Sen. Glenn Grothman tells Watchdog.org, \u201cIt seems as though the people out front in the investigation have strong Democratic connections.\u201d Grothman added, \u201cIt leads one to question whether this is a fishing expedition designed to embarrass Republicans rather than an investigation built on factual evidence.\u201d Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke is calling on an investigation of the investigators. From Watchdog.org: \u201cThe court-sanctioned dragnet has subpoenaed more than 100 conservative and free-market activists\u2026[T]he manifold legal attack on nonprofit political organizations has included pre-dawn raids on homes and offices; confiscated equipment and files; and demands for phone, email and other records.\u201d\n\nYOU HAVE A SEAT ON THE PANEL: MILITARY MISTREATMENT - The budget deal unfairly hurts military retirees. That was the consensus among viewer voters across all political parties during Monday\u2019s \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d All-Star Panel that featured Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., in the Center Seat. Bing Pulse found Democrats, Republicans, and independents agreeing with Ayotte when she said changes need to be made to the budget deal because, \u201cWe are taking it from the backs of our military retirees to pay for spending.\u201d The Granite State Senator also found wide agreement among all parties and genders when she expressed her disappointment that the House hasn\u2019t had a Select Committee on Benghazi. Watch here.\n\nDiscussion of accountability for the botched rollout of ObamaCare increased viewer voting intensity. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney\u2019s claim that the Office of Management and Budget works hard to get regulations right drew disagreement from all ends of the political spectrum and genders. Participation amongst audience panelists spiked to 22,000 viewer votes per minute when Daily Beast\u2019s Kirsten Powers stated , \u201cIt seems that every component of this is not done correctly. And the administration needs to account for that and explain why and how it happened and so people are held accountable.\u201d Bing Pulse tracked 258,000 viewer votes, take a deeper data dive and view the full results here.

Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H. WMUR reporter James Pindell called the group out for sending someone to follow Ayotte to a memorial service on Saturday. Pindell fired off at the group via Twitter saying, \u201cHey @AmericanBridge tracker: Put away your damn camera taping @KellyAyotte and others at Ray Burton memorial service. #nhpolitics #getclass.\u201d The group apologized on Twitter citing a miscommunication.

Ending Spending, the fiscal hawk group founded by billionaire Joe Ricketts, is spending more than $100,000 on Web ads and another $43,000 on television telling voters, \u201cIf you like your senator then you can keep her, if you don\u2019t, you know what to do.\u201d\n\n[Who\u2019s in, who\u2019s out so far in Super Bowl spots.
