A deputy mayor in London wants to take down software giant Oracle

Kit Malthouse, the deputy mayor for business and enterprise, said at an event Wednesday that he wanted a U.K. business to mount a serious challenge to the Calif.-based software and hardware multinational, which has a market value of about $190 billion.

“Like most people in government, I’ve been screwed by Oracle,” he said Wednesday, to rousing laughter from the hundred or so people in the room. “Anybody from Oracle in the room?”

Malthouse was speaking at an event about using massive quantities of data during London Technology Week, a promotional week featuring dozens of technology-focused events around the capital. He said the top priority was to “take Oracle down.”

“I want someone in London to crack the Oracle lock that they have,” he said. “Oracle seems to be the only people who can handle data on that vast volume.”

In an interview later, he said it was a “light-hearted speech” intended to energize the crowd. But he said there was some history between London and the company: Oracle hadn’t been willing to come down in price during negotiations when the government was trying to institute money-saving “austerity measures” in 2010, he said.

“They weren’t particularly generous on the discount,” he said. “We found ourselves in a situation where there wasn’t really anywhere else to go.”

Oracle declined to comment.

Malthouse said that many government departments were reliant on Oracle, including the police, which he previously oversaw as deputy mayor for policing and crime.

He added that IT managers were nervous about switching systems.
