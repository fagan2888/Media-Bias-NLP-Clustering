The Lionesses reached a new summit Saturday with a gritty 2-1 quarterfinal win over Canada, knocking out the hosts and advancing to the semifinals against Japan on Wednesday in Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nAmid the hugs and celebration at BC Place, Houghton spared a thought for the brilliant boost they\u2019re getting back home in the sport\u2019s motherland.\n\n\u201cWe always said that we had one aim when we came (to Canada),\u201d the England captain said. \u201cIt was to inspire a nation, and if the mums and dads have let their young girls watch the game late (Saturday) in England, I think hopefully we\u2019ve got a lot of young girls playing football at an early age, and in the next few years we have a stronger English national team.\u201d\n\nEngland already is guaranteed its most successful Women\u2019s World Cup. The Lionesses began in Canada with a 1-0 loss to France, but have racked up four consecutive 2-1 victories since, beating Mexico, Colombia, Norway and the hosts.\n\nOne game after they confidently rallied from behind to beat Norway, they hung on through 75 tense minutes against Canada after taking an early lead in a raucous stadium ardently hoping for a collapse.\n\nSince their only World Cup victory in 1966, the English men have made a tradition of disastrous performances on international stages, capped by their worst-ever World Cup showing in Brazil last year.\n\nThese Lionesses haven\u2019t bowed to the weight of history.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got such a good team, such a strong squad,\u201d said Taylor, who scored England\u2019s first goal. \u201cWe\u2019re not just 11 or 12 players. I just want us to keep on and continue this journey.\u201d\n\nTaylor started out playing against boys in England as a kid. She debuted for women\u2019s club team Tranmere Rovers at 15, something that would be nearly impossible today in the tiered levels of women\u2019s soccer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not many people under the age of 17\u2033 playing at the top level in England, she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re 17 or 18 in the league (now), you\u2019re doing really well. It\u2019s kind of amazing to see the progress the league has made.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "English women hope World Cup semifinal boosts the home game", "title": "English women hope World Cup semifinal boosts the home game", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "English women hope World Cup semifinal boosts the home game", "title": "English women hope World Cup semifinal boosts the home game", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/06/28/english_women_hope_world_cup_semifinal_boosts_the_home_game/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/wwcup-england-canada-soccer.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "English women hope World Cup semifinal boosts the home game", "title": "English women hope World Cup semifinal boosts the home game", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/06/wwcup-england-canada-soccer.jpeg4-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Greg Beacham", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Since their only World Cup victory in 1966, the English men have made a tradition of disastrous performances on international stages, capped by their worst-ever World Cup showing in Brazil last year.\nA sport once overlooked and underfunded in its football-mad nation has seized the spotlight this month, breaking barriers and toppling bastions of inveterate sexism with every World Cup victory.\nTopics: From the Wires, Entertainment News, NewsVANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) \u2014 Although they\u2019re not yet 30 years old, Jodie Taylor and Steph Houghton have already seen a revolution in English women\u2019s soccer during their careers.\n\u201cWe always said that we had one aim when we came (to Canada),\u201d the England captain said.\nI just want us to keep on and continue this journey.\u201dTaylor started out playing against boys in England as a kid."}
