Kevin Cramer (R-ND) will oppose the budget deal because $3 billion in savings come at the expense of giant crop insurance companies.\n\nIn his statement, Rep. Cramer called a proposal to limit windfall profits for insurance companies like Wells Fargo \u201cObamacare\u201d of crop insurance.\n\nHere\u2019s what he said:\n\nI cannot support the bill because it is a breach of the carefully negotiated 2014 Farm Bill. The White House\u2019s intent to re-open the Farm Bill and create a single payer \u201cObamacare of Crop Insurance\u201d is unacceptable to me and many members of Congress.\n\nActually, crop insurance is more like the \u201csingle-payer\u201d system Cramer abhors because the government pays two-thirds of farmer premium subsidies \u2013 regardless of farm income. North Dakota farmers are the second largest recipient of crop insurance premium subsidies.\n\nThere are no limits on who can receive crop insurance subsidies or the amount of the subsidy, so some farm businesses routinely receive more than $1 million a year in insurance premium support.\n\nUnlike the Farm Bill, the Affordable Care Act has a strict means test for health insurance subsidy recipients.\n\nCrop insurance is so bloated that is was once jokingly deemed \u201cObamacare for Corn\u201d by Steven Colbert.\n\nIn reality, the budget provision Cramer opposes would simply reduce the \u201crate of return\u201d guaranteed to crop insurance companies to 9 percent \u2013 down from 14 percent. That\u2019s still higher than the rate of return most ordinary people can expect on their investments.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Rep.
