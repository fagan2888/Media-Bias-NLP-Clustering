The bill\u2019s House counterpart, House Bill 2633, titled the KanCare Bridge to a Healthy Kansas Program, was introduced on February 8. Each bill would extend Medicaid eligibility to individuals whose income is 133 percent of the federal poverty level.\n\nThe state\u2019s House leadership has continually blocked votes on expanding Medicaid, and the state Senate leadership and Gov. Sam Brownback (R) have voiced their opposition to expansion.\n\nMixed Messages\n\n\u201cBut so that there can be no question of where the Kansas Senate stands on this issue, the body will take up the question of KanCare expansion under Obamacare for a vote in the next few weeks,\u201d Wagle said in a February 13 press release. \u201cOnce that vote is taken, I think it will be clear that a majority of the Kansas Senate firmly oppose expansion of KanCare under Obamacare.\u201d\n\nWagle\u2019s release was one of several she issued regarding her removal of state Sen. Mary Pilcher-Cook (R-Shawnee) from her chairmanship of the Senate Public Health and Welfare Committee. Wagle said Pilcher-Cook, who opposes Medicaid expansion, violated Senate rules by trying to add an \u201canti-Obamacare amendment\u201d to an unrelated bill.\n\nPilcher-Cook told Health Care News she had challenged the Senate Rules Committee\u2019s ruling that her amendment was out of order, but she was outvoted 15\u201322. Pilcher-Cook says the point of her action was to send a message to the Kansas House.\n\n\u201cBecause I was aware the majority of the Kansas Senate was opposed to expanding Medicaid, I offered the amendment as a way to communicate with the Kansas House,\u201d Pilcher-Cook said. \u201cIt was my way of saying, \u2018The Senate opposes Medicaid expansion. There is no need for the Kansas House to spend time or energy on the subject.\u2019\u201d\n\nPilcher-Cook says she doubts Wagle\u2019s commitment to opposing Medicaid.\n\n\u201cEver since Obamacare passed, President Wagle has made numerous public comments that she is open to the idea of expanding Medicaid in the State of Kansas,\u201d said Pilcher-Cook.\n\nIn a statement to the press, Wagle said she \u201cfirmly oppose[s] Obamacare.\u201d\n\nWagle\u2019s office did not respond when specifically asked whether Wagle opposes expanding KanCare.\n\nExpansion Still an Option?\n\nWagle\u2019s phrasing in her press release echoes Brownback\u2019s State of the State Address: \u201cIt was Obamacare that caused the problem. We should not expand Obamacare to solve the problem.\u201d\n\nAn October 2015 memo from Brownback\u2019s deputy communications director, Melika Willoughby, called expanding Medicaid \u201cmorally reprehensible.\u201d But when asked what Brownback would do if a bill to expand the program reached his desk, Brownback spokesperson Eileen Hawley left the door open.\n\n\u201cWe do not speculate on any pending legislation,\u201d Hawley told Health Care News. \u201cHowever, the governor will carefully review any bill that comes to his desk.\n\n\u201cThe governor has consistently said that any Medicaid expansion effort would need to be fiscally sustainable, include a work requirement for able-bodied adults with no dependents, and eliminate the waiting list for individuals with disabilities,\u201d Hawley said.\n\nExpansion \u2018Not the Answer\u2019\n\nKansas Policy Institute Vice President and Policy Director James Franko says expanding Medicaid would not solve Kansas\u2019 health insurance shortfalls or increase access to affordable, quality health care.\n\n\u201cExpanding Medicaid is not the answer to real concerns about health insurance and access to quality care,\u201d Franko said. \u201cExpanding Medicaid would bust the Kansas budget and not improve health outcomes, as we saw via the recent study in Oregon,\u201d referring to a 2014 study published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n\u201cThe feds have already admitted they cannot sustain the Medicaid match, so the budget impact will only grow in the future,\u201d Franko said.\n\nOthers oppose Medicaid expansion because it would encourage able-bodied Kansans to depend on the government while making access to care more difficult for disabled individuals.\n\n\u201cExpanding Medicaid would increase the cost of health care for a majority of Kansas citizens, and it would harm the quality of health care for all Kansas citizens,\u201d Pilcher-Cook said. \u201cIt would create dependencies on government by able-bodied, childless adults, and it would put able-bodied adults in the front of the line while thousands of Kansans with intellectual disabilities are still sitting on waiting lists for needed services.\u201d\n\nBrownback spokesperson Hawley cited placing the able-bodied ahead of the disabled as a reason for opposing expansion.\n\n\u201cExpansion of Medicaid creates new entitlements for able-bodied adults without dependents, prioritizing those who choose not to work above those who are intellectually, developmentally, or physically disabled,\u201d Hawley said.\n\nPressing for Alternatives\n\nHawley says Lt. Governor Jeff Colyer, who is a medical doctor, is spearheading a search for alternative policies to improve delivery of health care services in rural areas of the state.\n\nFranko agrees with that approach, saying Kansas should expand telemedicine and direct primary care, a system in which physicians and patients agree upon a monthly fee for a suite of services, bypassing insurance companies, instead of expanding Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIn a rural state like Kansas, expanded telemedicine and direct primary care offer tremendous potential to increase access and quality care,\u201d Franko said. \u201cLoosening scope-of-practice restrictions also brings more providers into a position to help serve the needs of patients. At the same time, these sorts of changes increase access, [and] they don\u2019t ask Kansas taxpayers for more money to expand Medicaid to able-bodied, childless adults.\u201d\n\nPilcher-Cook says legislation that would serve Kansans better than expanding KanCare is already in the works, such as a bill to encourage charity care.\n\n\u201cWe are also working on a pilot project that would provide health care cost transparency to state employees,\u201d Pilcher-Cook said.\n\nDustin Siggins (dustinsiggins@gmail.com) writes from Washington, DC.
