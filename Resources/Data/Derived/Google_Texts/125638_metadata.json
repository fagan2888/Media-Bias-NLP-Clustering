Nothing was off limits during Hathaway\u2019s interview with Refinery29, which was set up to promote her film The Intern.\n\nNow that she\u2019s been out of the spotlight for a bit, it sounds like Anne has had time to actually take in some pop culture, which has inevitably landed her on the Kardashian pulse. That said, Hathaway has some evolving ideas about the Kardashians and their empire. Hathaway admits that at first she thought the Kardashians were simply famous for being reality stars, but then her thoughts changed.\n\n\u201cI used to be like everyone else and think the Kardashians are just famous for being famous. But I\u2019ve been really impressed with how supportive Kim Kardashian has been of Caitlyn Jenner.\u201d\n\nWho else is Anne Hathaway aware of? Well, none other than everyone\u2019s favorite \u201cIt\u201d girl right now, Amy Schumer. Schumer, who had a breakout hit with the film Trainwreck, actually made fun of Anne Hathaway in the film. Her character and Bill Hader\u2019s get into a fight at a ceremony honoring Hader\u2019s character, Amy makes a comment that he\u2019s holding around his award like Anne Hathaway at an Oscar party.\n\nAs the Inquisitr reported, the actress seemed to take it in stride and laughed at the joke. Going from her interview, it seems like Hathaway really has a girl crush on Amy Schumer and is encouraged by the voice she\u2019s giving women in Hollywood and outside of that spectrum as well.\n\n\u201cI am crushing so hard on Amy Schumer. Women like her who have chosen to stand up for themselves and face the bullies are being so embraced. I think that\u2019s the new message: Figure out who you are, be happy with yourself, and don\u2019t take anything from anyone. Don\u2019t let anyone make you feel bad about you. That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been growing into.\u201d\n\nAs for what people really think of her, Anne talks about this total win or utter fail mentality that this generation seems to be growing up in.\n\n\u201cIt does very much at times feel like we\u2019re living in the days of the Coliseum, where people get the thumbs up and you live, or the thumbs down and you die, but the thing is, you won\u2019t die. Sometimes it feels like you will, but you won\u2019t die from humiliation on the internet. You have to get really strong and dig down deep and get really tough. For the first time in my life, I\u2019m feeling comfortable. Not settled, not complacent, but just like I can take whatever is going to come.\u201d\n\nAnne Hathaway\u2019s new film The Intern hits theaters on September 25.\n\n[Photo by Stuart C.
