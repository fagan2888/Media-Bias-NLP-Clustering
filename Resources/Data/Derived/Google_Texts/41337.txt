L.B. Tate, a 66-year-old double amputee, drives his bright red scooter a mile both ways to receive health care at Northern Nevada Hopes in downtown Reno. He's a Vietnam War veteran but doesn't go to the VA hospital where, he said, it takes three months to get an appointment. At Hopes, Tate can get an appointment much faster — often within two weeks.

Hopes’ new $13 million nonprofit medical facility, The Stacie Mathewson Community Wellness Center, opened a few weeks ago at 580 W. Fifth St. It provides medical care and wellness services to people with and without health insurance. Stacie Mathewson is a local philanthropist who donated $1.9 million for a dedicated pediatric clinic and addiction services named after her son, Josh Montoya, who died of a drug overdose.

The public can visit the facility from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Tuesday during an open house.

"I get treated like a king here," Tate said several times. "I'm a ladies' man. Everyone knows me."

In Oakland where he used to live, Tate said, "you get treated like a number, but in Reno they treat you like a person." Sometimes he likes to visit the clinic just to see "the girls."

"I tell him not to run anyone over with his 'Cadillac,' " joked Samantha Jacinto, one of Hopes' staff.

When it started in 1997, Hopes was an HIV and AIDS care center. In 2012, it expanded into a primary medical care center out of a converted weekly motel serving 600 patients, then to a few of houses and portable buildings.

"I used to draw his blood in the hallway," Lisa Johnson, a LabCorp technician, said of Tate.

Johnson was supposed to be a temporary phlebotomist 12 years ago, but she liked Hopes so much she stayed. She said the rooms in Hopes' previous facilities were small. Now, she'll finally have an assistant in a room big enough for Tate's scooter to move in and out of comfortably.

Today, Hopes serves about 5,000 patients and expects that to double by 2017. The new building can expand as patient numbers increase.

"We're seeing unprecedented demand for primary care services," said John Packham, director of health policy research at the University of Nevada School of Medicine. "That clinic is an important addition to meeting that demand."

The 38,000-square-foot medical facility let Hopes add services to its current adult primary care, behavioral health counseling, case management, needle exchange program and onsite pharmacy. It now also offers pediatric primary care, radiology and expanded substance use treatment.

“L.B. has overcome so many challenges, not only being diabetic, but also being a bilateral amputee. And he had a stroke," said Trudy Italiano, Hopes' community health nurse, who supports senior citizens in their home.

Tate was Italiano's first client. They've worked together for almost two years.

"It's the only phone number I know by heart," he said.

Tate's legs were amputated below the knee due to complications from diabetes. Italiano prepares his weekly medicines and insulin dosages for home treatment. He's still learning how to walk with prosthetic legs and relies on the scooter and a powered wheelchair.

"He’s really come a long way," Italiano said." One of his goals is to go dancing when he gets strong enough."

Italiano joked that he would probably "ask her and 15 other ladies to go dancing and they would all go."

Tate receives Social Security disability to help pay for living expenses. A caregiver, payee and social worker also help him take care of himself and bills. Medicaid and Medicare help pay for Tate's medicines, doctor visits and surgical needs. Both insurances will also help him pay for new teeth and cataract surgery. People at Hopes coordinate all of these doctor visits as part of their holistic approach.

"A lot of people don't have access to care and that's just horrible," said Sharon Chamberlain, executive director of Northern Nevada Hopes.

In 2014, the Affordable Care Act expanded Medicaid benefits to 181,000 Nevadans, according to the state, and many more Nevadans were able to sign up for first-time coverage under the health care exchange.

“That’s why community health centers are vital, because about 10 percent of (Washoe) County is uninsured,” Packham said. That's about 75,000 people.

Many newly insured people face hurdles to accessing health care services, such as lack of transportation, language barriers or inability to pay, according to Hopes. Hopes tries to break down those barriers by offering wrap-around services, such as transportation and housing assistance, case management and group therapy.

"There's such a lack of psychological and behavioral health services in town," Chamberlain said. "That's a big gap we fill."

Tate also uses Hopes' behavioral counseling services to help him cope with his mother's death.

"Mental health is stigmatized, but any time you get people in primary care setting you can screen for depression," Packham said. "That’s an appropriate way to deal with behavioral health needs."

Proactive, outpatient mental health treatment is better than hospital visits, he added.

An estimated 25 percent of Hopes patients also don’t have stable housing, which makes it difficult for them to manage their health.

"Managing a mental health condition becomes a low priority when trying to survive," Chamberlain said. People often ignore their need to take and refill prescription drugs that manage conditions.

Tate said Italiano stays on his case about taking medicine. He lives at City Center Apartments but applied for a Section 8 housing voucher so he can move somewhere closer to the mountains, he said. He likes the view.

Hopes also helps homeless people access affordable health care services. Hopes' fees work on a sliding scale based on a person's income and insurance. For example, someone making at or below the federal poverty line ($11,880 per year) with no insurance will only pay $10 per medical visit or $2 per counseling visit. People with insurance pay based on their insurance rules.

“It’s absolutely great to see Hopes and others expand offerings of primary care and putting them in the right spots in underserved parts of our community,” Packham said.
