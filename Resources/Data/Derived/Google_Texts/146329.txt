On Thursday Democratic United States Senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine joined six of their senate colleagues to introduce the States Achieve Medicaid Expansion Act of 2016.

This new legislation guarantees federal reimbursement of 100 percent of the cost to states for the first three years to expand Medicaid.

Nineteen states,including Virginia, have not expanded their Medicaid programs.

Kaine says that the expansion would grant healthcare coverage to 400,000 low-income Virginians while saving the commonwealth more than $150 million.
