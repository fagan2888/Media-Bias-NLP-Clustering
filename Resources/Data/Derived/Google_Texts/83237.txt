This may not cost her her job , but it's a safe bet that Republicans will have a few questions about it when they finally get the chance to grill Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius next week, via the Washington Post :

Sebelius agreed last night to appear before the House Energy and Commerce Committe on Oct. 30. The panel will also have an Obamacare-themed panel on Thursday, when they'll hear from several of the companies that are working on the troubled healthcare.gov, including the two main contractors, CGI Federal and Quality Software Services Inc. House Republicans have made it no secret that they are out for blood. While they might not get it in their preferred form—Sebelius' job—Obamacare's stumbling start may give them a much-needed consolation prize: the chance to turn the page from this month's government shutdown and debt-ceiling fight, which has done serious damage to GOP polling numbers.
