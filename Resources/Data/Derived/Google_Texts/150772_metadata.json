When they arrived on the scene, they could see the dog about 100 yards offshore,\u201d Chisholm said Sunday morning. \u201cIt looked to us like he was hanging on to an ice floe.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday evening, Hero\u2019s very thankful owner, Jeremy Doe of Bar Harbor, said the family\u2019s 2-year-old Australian Cattle Dog was resting comfortably at home, albeit appearing still a bit traumatized by the events.\n\n\u201cHe is only going outside today just long enough to \u2018do his business\u2019 and then coming right back in,\u201d Doe said.\n\nIt all started when Hero was let outside late Saturday evening, something Doe said is a nightly routine.\n\n\u201cHe always comes back after 15 minutes or so,\u201d Doe said. \u201cI called him [after 15 minutes], and after a half-hour I started to worry.\u201d\n\nDoe went looking for Hero and eventually came across the dog\u2019s tracks, which led from the road to the edge of water.\n\n\u201cI could hear him out there, barking in the ocean, but I couldn\u2019t see him,\u201d Doe said. \u201cI called 911 right away.\u201d\n\nAs Doe waited for the rescue personnel, he said Hero\u2019s barking was growing fainter.\n\nOnce on the scene, Chisholm said, two members of his crew, firefighters Derek Zozzaro and Matt Lindsley, who are members of the United States Coast Guard, suited up in cold-water rescue gear and immediately began swimming out to the dog against the incoming tide, through moderate snow and breaking through 1 to 2 inches of ice on the way, Chisholm said.\n\n\u201cJust before they got there, the dog slipped off the ice,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was on his last legs.\u201d\n\nZozzaro was able to grab the dog and pull him onto his own chest, Chisholm said. The rescuer then flipped onto his back in a classic cold-water rescue technique and was pulled back to shore by a rope, the 50-pound dog in his arms.\n\n\u201cDerek really latched on to him,\u201d Chisholm said. \u201cThere was no way my guys were stopping until we had him [because] we are all dog people.\u201d\n\nChisholm estimated the water in Southwest Harbor was in the upper 30-degree range or colder at the time.\n\nAn ambulance was standing by and the dog was rushed to it, where he was dried off with towels and warmed up.\n\n\u201cHe was cold, wet and scared but seemed no worse for wear once he was dried off,\u201d Chisholm said.\n\nDoe, who said he had no idea what attracted Hero onto the ice in the first place, said he estimated the dog was out there about two hours.\n\n\u201cThese rescuers are phenomenal,\u201d he said. \u201cThey risked their lives to save our dog, and we can\u2019t thank them enough.\u201d\n\nThe Does have had Hero since he was a puppy. Jeremy Doe said the dog was \u201cgetting lots of love and treats\u201d on Sunday.\n\nChisholm said his department averages several such canine rescues every season.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also rescued deer and people who have fallen through the ice,\u201d he said.\n\nMore than once, his crew has rescued people who have attempted to rescue their own dogs and have fallen through the ice \u2014 something he strongly discourages.\n\n\u201cThis is what we do. Call us for help,\u201d Chisholm said. \u201cWe have the proper gear and train all year for these situations, [and] we want to help.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SOUTHWEST HARBOR, Maine \u2014 A dog named Hero needed some heroes of his own after falling into the chilly waters of Southwest Harbor early Sunday morning.Nearly a dozen members of Southwest Harbor fire, police and ambulance departments responded to a 911 call that came in just before 12:30 a.m. about [...] Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "SOUTHWEST HARBOR, Maine \u2014 A dog named Hero needed some heroes of his own after falling into the chilly waters of Southwest Harbor early Sunday morning.
