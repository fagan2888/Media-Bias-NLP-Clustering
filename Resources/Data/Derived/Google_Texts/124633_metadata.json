Our long nightmare of lawlessness and Obamacare and weakness as it relates to foreign policy \u2026 is coming to an end.\u201d\n\nThough he acknowledged he has not yet selected a favorite from among the wide group of likely Republican contenders, Hannity said all conservatives \u2014 including himself \u2014 must begin the process of vetting the field of hopefuls now. He said this is such an important step because America needs someone willing and able to restore America\u2019s greatness.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\n\u201cI look at this audience,\u201d he said, \u201c\u2026 and I see one young face after another, which gives me hope for the future. Here\u2019s the problem: I never thought there would be a time in America where 50 million of our fellow citizens \u2026 live in poverty.\u201d\n\nThat number is nearly 20 million more than when Barack Obama was inaugurated, Hannity added.\n\n\u201cI feel bad,\u201d he continued, \u201cbecause this may become the first time in American history where our generation leaves this country in worse shape than that in which we found it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThough candid about the perils our nation faces, he did offer an optimistic view of the future provided Republicans unite behind the common goal of saving the U.S.\n\n\u201cI would like to see the establishment and the Tea Party unite,\u201d he said, offering several issues through which that goal can be met.\n\nMost importantly, he said the next president must be one willing to eradicate the threat of radical Islam. A number of other topics are also likely to appeal to Republicans of all stripes.\n\n\u201cWe have more resources than the entire Middle East combined,\u201d he said of our reliance on foreign oil. \u201cLet us break this monopoly. Let American commit to being energy independent in five years. Let you the parents choose the school that you want to send your children to. Let\u2019s secure America\u2019s borders for the safety and security of the American people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nCiting the sacrifices of our military members throughout the history of this nation and the next generation for whom we will leave America to, Hannity said we must make every effort to correct our course.\n\n\u201cWe owe them that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to work day and night; blood, sweat and tears. We owe it to them that when God calls us home \u2026 that we leave them with what President Reagan described a shining beacon city on a hill.\u201d\n\nClick to see the latest news from CPAC 2015\n\nSign up below for a morning, afternoon, and evening update each day of CPAC.\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "He countered today's struggles with the hope of a bright future made possible through a coalition of patriots.", "author": "B.
