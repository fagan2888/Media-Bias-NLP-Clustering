The new Southampton Town Board was sworn in at Town Hall midday on Monday and councilmen Stan Glinka and Brad Bender took their seats at the town dais for the first time.



“We’re really turning a new page here in the town of Southampton,” Mr. Bender said after being sworn in. “I think we’re going to be able to do some good things.”



Mr. Bender, a landscaper from Flanders, and Mr. Glinka, a banker from Hampton Bays, were the top two vote getters in a four-way race last fall for the seats being vacated by Councilmen Chris Nuzzi and Jim Malone.



Supervisor Anna Throne-Holst was sworn in, by U.S. Representative Tim Bishop, for her third term at the head of the town and hinted at an ambitious and progressive agenda for the town in the coming months.



“I think we all feel we are in a time and position to move Southampton Town forward in ways we have been a bit stymied from in recent years,” Ms. Throne-Holst said to a large audience of supporters and family members of the various officials being sworn in. “As elected officials, public service is, at the end of the day, what each of us puts into it.”



Two new members of the Southampton Town Trustees, Scott Horowitz and Ray Overton were also sworn in on Monday as was Southampton Town Clerk Sundy Schermeyer, for a third term, and town Justices Barbara Wilson and Deborah Kooperstein and Southampton Town Highway Superintendent Alex Gregor, who started his second term in office with the onslaught of snow last week. Mr. Gregor had a very publicly rocky relationship with the Town Board during much of his first term and on Monday reminded the five lawmakers that there jobs will continue to be intertwined.



“To my fellow elected officials,” he said, looking to the supervisor and board members in the front rows of the audience, “we are all stuck with each other, maybe we should try to make it work.”
