And groups do even better if they can gossip and ostracize untrustworthy members.\n\nRelated: One Terrible Boss, 10 Great Workplace Tips\n\n\u201cWhile both of these behaviors can be misused,\" he added, \u201cour findings suggest that they also serve very important functions for groups and society.\u201d\n\nThe research game involved 216 participants, divided into groups, who decided whether to make financial choices that would benefit their group. Researchers commonly use this public-goods exercise to examine social dilemmas because individual participants will benefit the most by selfishly free-riding off everyone else\u2019s contributions while contributing nothing themselves.\n\nBefore moving on to the next round with an entirely new group, participants could gossip about their prior group members. Future group members then received that information and could decide to exclude\u2014ostracize\u2014a suspect participant from the group before deciding to make their next financial choices.\n\nSingle Out Selfish People\n\nresearchers found that when people learn\u2014through gossip\u2014about the behavior of others, they use this information to align with those deemed cooperative. Those who have behaved selfishly can then be excluded from group activities, based on the prevailing gossip.\n\nRelated: 7 Ways to Fix Your Biggest Management Mistake\n\nThis serves the group\u2019s greater good, for selfish types are known to exploit more cooperative people for their own gains. \u201cBy removing defectors, more cooperative individuals can more freely invest in the public good without fear of exploitation,\u201d the researchers say.\n\nHope for the Castaways\n\nWhen people know that others may gossip about them\u2014and experience the resulting social exclusion\u2014they tend to learn from the experience and reform their behavior by cooperating more in future group settings. In contrast, highly anonymous groups, like many Internet message boards, lack accountability\u2014allowing antisocial behavior to thrive.\n\n\u201cThose who do not reform their behavior,\u201d says Robb Willer, an associate professor of sociology, \u201cbehaving selfishly despite the risk of gossip and ostracism, tended to be targeted by other group members who took pains to tell future group members about the person\u2019s untrustworthy behavior.\n\n\u201cThese future groups could then detect and exclude more selfish individuals, ensuring they could avoid being taken advantage of.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Men and Women Still Can't Get Along at Work\n\nThe very threat of ostracism frequently deterred selfishness in the group. Even people who had been ostracized often contributed at higher levels when they returned to the group. \u201cExclusion compelled them to conform to the more cooperative behavior of the rest of the group,\u201d the researchers write in a study published in the journal Psychological Science.\n\nWorried About Reputation\n\nThe study reflects past research showing that when people know others may talk about their reputation, they tend to behave more generously. Where reputational concerns are especially strong, people sometimes engage in \u201ccompetitive altruism,\u201d attempting to be highly pro-social to avoid exclusion from a group.\n\nThe same appears to hold true for those returning from \u201cexile\u201d\u2014the incentive is to cooperate rather than risk more trouble. \u201cDespite negative connotations, the pairing of the capacity to gossip and to ostracize undesirable individuals from groups has a strong positive effect on cooperation levels in groups,\u201d Willer says.\n\nWorkplace Dynamics\n\nWiller says the research is applicable to some workplace dynamics. For example, what if gossiping and ostracism were impossible? That result could be worrisome, he adds.k\n\nRelated: 6 Career-Killing Phrases to Quit Using Now\n\n\u201cImagine a workplace,\u201d he says, \u201cwhere an employee\u2019s performance could only be seen by individuals in the immediate setting, and those individuals could not pass on what they had seen to other co-workers or supervisors. Further, imagine a work setting where managers could not fire delinquent employees. It would be hard to deter workers from cutting corners ethically or freeloading, working only when they were directly supervised.\u201d\n\nThe research advances what was previously known about gossip and ostracism at the individual level to the group level, Willer says. Looking ahead, he and his colleagues are conducting field experiments on how the threat of gossip and exclusion affect behavior in real-world settings\u2014in one study, calling car repair shops for estimates, with one group of callers stating they are active users of Yelp, the online review service that can make or break reputations.\n\nJust Human Nature\n\nAs Willer points out, whether one calls it gossip or \u201creputational information sharing,\u201d as sociologists and psychologists do, this behavior, along with ostracism, seems fundamental to human nature. People pass on information about how others behave in workplaces, student workgroups, business and political coalitions, on the Internet, in volunteer organizations and beyond. While much of this behavior may be undesirable and malicious, a lot of it is critical to deterring selfishness and maintaining social order in groups.\n\n\u201cI think it does speak to the mechanisms that keep people behaving honestly and generously in many settings and, where behavior is entirely anonymous, helps explain when they don\u2019t,\u201d Willer says.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Futurity.org.
