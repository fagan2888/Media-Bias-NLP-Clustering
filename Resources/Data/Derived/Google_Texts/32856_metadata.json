It\u2019s not unusual for a few to say no to ethanol subsidies, as Arizona Sen. John McCain did in 2008.\n\nBut when a Republican candidate vows to repeal the renewable fuel standard and still remains second in the Iowa polls, it\u2019s not unusual to see everyone scratching their heads.\n\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz wants to end the federal fuel standard, which mandates that gasoline contain a certain percentage of ethanol, made from corn, one of Iowa\u2019s biggest crops. Without the regulation, farming corn would not be profitable, many farmers here say.\n\nWhich, in a usual political year, might spell trouble for Cruz, who wants to remove all energy subsidies and let a free market determine the nation\u2019s energy choices. As Iowans prepare for Monday night\u2019s first in the nation caucuses, ethanol boosters are targeting Cruz, running second to real estate mogul in the polls.\n\nAnd yet, at a Sunday rally in Iowa City, supporters showed no concern about the candidate\u2019s position \u2013 and no empathy for their farming neighbors.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the government should subsidize business \u2013 even big oil,\u201d said Doug Schrage, an IT professional from Tiffin. Like many of his fellow Iowans, Schrage believes that even without the subsidy, the Iowan economy will \u201cfix itself.\u201d\n\nSalem resident Jodi Fleet isn\u2019t sure Cruz is her candidate, but she thinks his stance has merit. The Iowa economy is more diverse, she said, and relies on more than just corn.\n\n\u201cI think we can do more with the economy,\u201d Fleet said. She would like to see the United States sell more products abroad, as \u201cexports have gone down.\u201d\n\nThe ethanol debate has been complicated by the economics of the global energy sector. Corn prices soared as oil companies added ethanol to fuel blends, prompting Iowa farmers to plant more corn. But when they took abundant harvests to market, prices dropped, reducing their profitability.\n\nRenewable fuel standards imposed by the federal government and some states act as a price support for the corn market. If the mandates were withdrawn, Iowa farmers would likely take a further hit, a loss of income that would ripple through the state. A 2014 study conducted by John Urbanchuk at ABF Economics contended that the ethanol industry employs 47,600 Iowans while contributing $2.5 billion to Iowan households. Overall, the ethanol industry makes up 3.5 percent of Iowa\u2019s GDP.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that without the mandate, energy companies wouldn\u2019t be required to use ethanol at all. Recent numbers from the Chicago Board of Trade show ethanol futures selling at $1.426 per gallon while gasoline futures are selling at $1.2727 per gallon. But if energy companies are no longer forced to buy ethanol, that price could plummet, making it nearly impossible for farmers to sell off their crop.\n\nA recent Cruz campaign email said this: \u201cThe ethanol lobby \u2013 which is highly influential in the state of Iowa \u2013 is coming after Ted because he doesn\u2019t believe Washington politicians should be picking winners and losers in the energy sector and handing out special subsidies to one industry or another.\u201d\n\nFor some Iowans, the thought of using food for fuel compels them to consider Cruz as a viable candidate. Marion resident Dan Lyttle \u2013 an engineer for Rockwell \u2013 made an effort to see as many candidates as possible, but he still thinks Cruz has the right idea. He isn\u2019t worried about how the lack of subsidies could affect the Iowan economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be an impact,\u201d Lyttle admits, \u201cbut it\u2019s probably best not to use food for fuel.\u201d\n\nKeith Differding, Lyttle\u2019s neighbor who works for a local pizza place, says Marion is a farming community. Even if farmers don\u2019t get the subsidy, Differding doesn\u2019t think his business will be affected, even if farmers can no longer afford to order out for pizza.\n\nThough food will always be needed, food manufacturers may not always turn to Iowan farmers. A competitive market for crop futures could make it less expensive for food manufacturers to import crops from overseas rather than buy them in the U.S.\n\nIf the ethanol mandate goes away and the demand for other crops doesn\u2019t grow, Iowan farmers may find themselves with empty fields.\n\nEven those with ties to the farming community support Cruz. Ron and Carlene Murphy say they\u2019ve always been for Cruz. Ron Murphy, who farmed for 30 years and has a brother still farming, believes it\u2019s time to see the subsidy go.\n\n\u201cThey got along before with out it,\u201d Ron Murphy said.\n\nCarlene Murphy says Cruz\u2019s commitment to fulfill campaign promises \u2013 mainly working to repeal the Affordable Care Act \u2013 appeals to her more so than the possibility of economic decline in her state.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Carlene Murphy said. \u201cI don\u2019t want food for fuel. Let capitalism pick and choose.\u201d\n\nAssociate professor of political science Cary Covington of the University of Iowa says that stance is not uncommon among Iowan voters, which could explain Cruz\u2019s popularity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of his pitch,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not his whole package.\u201d\n\nOther rally goers said Cruz\u2019s stance on faith and religious values simply meant more to them than ethanol.\n\nFarmer Mark Hostetler thinks ethanol subsidies are actually holding ethanol back.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want that hand out,\u201d Hostetler said. \u201cI want ethanol to stand on its own, and Cruz is smart enough. Instead of just wanting votes, he\u2019s going after the idea that it\u2019s a free market and ethanol can stand on its own if you just let it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Alison Martin IOWA CITY, Iowa - It's not unusual for presidential candidates to pledge loyalty to corn.
