'Follow the Sun' -- an Albuquerque bus company -- is leading a special effort this holiday season.



The group is collecting donations for the four families who lost everything in the Carnuel Mountain Lodge fire.

Owner Rose Bleth said some of the fire victims ride her school buses.

"Just elated that people were just so giving," Bleth said.

Saturday was the first of four collection days at Roosevelt Middle School in Tijeras and Manzano High School in Albuquerque.

Leshay Morris is one of the recipients of the items. She's six months pregnant with her first child.

Morris said seeing the community come together for her family helps her deal with the shock of having nowhere to live.

"We were building a life there, we wanted to have the baby there, so this is amazing. and I want to thank everyone," Morris said.

Geno Caggiano is a single dad with three daughters. He said he found himself speechless as donations kept coming.

"Total strangers, hugging us, handing us money," he said.

Organizers said Saturday's collection was a success.

Many people donated clothes and blankets. But what they need to see more of is food, furniture, pots, pans and other home items.

People who donated said they're happy to help.

"These people lost everything at a very critical time of the year," said Catherine Cross Maple of Tijeras.

Follow the Sun will be collecting at Roosevelt Middle School and Manzano High School through Tuesday. You can drop items off between the hours of 8 a.m. and 4 p.m.

You can also go to any Wells Fargo to give money.

The families will be presented the donations on Christmas Eve at noon.
