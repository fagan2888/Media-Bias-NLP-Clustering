The acceleration in health care costs should push the core PCE deflator higher, thereby helping to narrow the 60 basis point gap between the year-over-year growth rates in the two series.\"\n\nThe focus of the inflation conversation lately has been on wage growth, which also has been subdued. But if health care inflation acceleration is real, that conversation could shift quickly. And this could put the Fed under increasing amounts of pressure to tighten monetary policy sooner than later.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Sam Ro", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "It's been low for a while.", "creator": "bySamRo", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/health-care-cost-inflation-accelerating-2014-2", "image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5304ee126bb3f7596bd60b40-506-253/chart-of-the-day-health-care-cost-inflation-is-accelerating.jpg", "title": "CHART OF THE DAY: Health Care Cost Inflation Is Accelerating", "site": "themoneygame", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "moneygame,clusterstock", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Chart Of The Day, Inflation, Health Care, Sam Ro", "description": "It's been low for a while.", "author": "Sam Ro", "sailthru.date": "2014-02-19", "sailthru.title": "CHART OF THE DAY: Health Care Cost Inflation Is Accelerating", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5304ee126bb3f7596bd60b40-50-50/chart-of-the-day-health-care-cost-inflation-is-accelerating.jpg", "news_keywords": "Chart Of The Day, Inflation, Health Care, Sam Ro", "tbi-image": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5304ee126bb3f7596bd60b40/chart-of-the-day-health-care-cost-inflation-is-accelerating.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2014-02-19", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/sam-ro"}, "sailthru.description": "It's been low for a while.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "It's been low for a while.", "title": "CHART OF THE DAY: Health Care Cost Inflation Is Accelerating", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/health-care-cost-inflation-accelerating-2014-2", "image": "http://static4.businessinsider.com/image/5304ee126bb3f7596bd60b40-1190-625/chart-of-the-day-health-care-cost-inflation-is-accelerating.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "CHART OF THE DAY: Health Care Cost Inflation Is Accelerating", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/5304ee126bb3f7596bd60b40/chart-of-the-day-health-care-cost-inflation-is-accelerating.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "moneygame"}, "article_summary": "Inflation has been lower than expected in the U.S.One of the main reasons for this is because health care cost inflation has been extremely tame.\nBut if health care inflation acceleration is real, that conversation could shift quickly.\n\"The price of \u201cselected health care industries\u201d rose +0.3% in January following gains of +0.2% in December and +0.3% in November.\"\nThe acceleration in health care costs should push the core PCE deflator higher, thereby helping to narrow the 60 basis point gap between the year-over-year growth rates in the two series.\"\n\"Healthcare inflation has begun to accelerate,\" wrote Deutsche Bank's Joe LaVorgna pointing to the new producer price index numbers."}
