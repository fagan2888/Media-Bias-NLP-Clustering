In California, the welfare program is called CalWORKs.\n\nThe idea was to prevent people receiving aid from having more children.\n\nThat law is still on the books and today, according to a brief from the Western Center on Law and Poverty (WCLP), 13.4 percent of children in CalWORKs households \u2014 that\u2019s 143,300 children \u2014 are \u201ccurrently impacted by the (maximum family grant) rule.\u201d\n\nCalWORKs provides needy families with basic-needs cash grants, and it\u2019s not much. According to WCLP, the average grant is $464 per month. That puts a family of three at roughly 29 percent of the federal poverty level. The maximum grant would push families up to 41 percent of the poverty level.\n\nIf the maximum family grant (MFG) rule were repealed, most households would receive an additional $122 per month.\n\nSB899 would do just that, but the bill is currently on hold in the California Senate.\n\nIn the meantime, senators will vote Thursday on a resolution to repeal the rule \u201cas soon as legislatively possible.\u201d\n\nThe movement to repeal the law has drawn together groups that are not normally on the same side of an issue. In addition to the Western Center on Law and Poverty, the ACLU, Planned Parenthood and the Catholic Conference all support its overturn.\n\nNed Dolejsi, executive director of the California Catholic Conference, pointed to research showing that people on public assistance don\u2019t have more children than the general population. \u201cWe\u2019re choosing to have a policy which penalizes the poor child and the woman who is poor,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019re penalizing them for no particular good public policy reason.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he said, \u201cessentially the state is incentivizing poor women to choose an abortion, since the state says we\u2019re not going to give you any assistance to raise a child.\u201d\n\nA withering piece on Slate calls the rule \u201cthe most discriminatory law in the land\u201d and notes:\n\nAnd, for all the ways these laws disadvantage poor families, they also fail in their purported mission of reducing family size. Several studies\u2014including a 2001 analysis from the Government Accounting Office\u2014have found no substantial relationship between welfare caps and a reduction in births. \u201cDespite the political attractiveness of caps,\u201c writes researcher Michael Wiseman in a 2000 study on welfare policy and children, \u201cthere is little empirical support for expecting them to do much beyond reducing costs. \u2026\u201d\n\nWhile repealing the rule would cost California about $220 million annually, the Urban Institute estimates that it could reduce childhood poverty rates by 7 to 13 percent.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The idea behind the maximum family grant was to prevent people receiving aid from having more children.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Advocates Urge Repeal of 'Maximum Family Grant'\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2014\\/07\\/03\\/advocates-urge-repeal-of-maximum-family-grant-calworks-welfare\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-07-03 01:03:31\",\"mod_date\":\"2014-07-04 07:47:36\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":19984,\"author_id\":\"240\",\"author_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"author_display_name\":\"Lisa Aliferis\",\"tags\":[],\"categories\":[\"Policy\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2013\\/09\\/RS1369_IMG_1902-scr-e1378443813373.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "The idea behind the maximum family grant was to prevent people receiving aid from having more children.", "title": "Advocates Urge Repeal of \u2018Maximum Family Grant\u2019", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2014/07/03/advocates-urge-repeal-of-maximum-family-grant-calworks-welfare/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2013/09/RS1369_IMG_1902-scr-640x480.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda14e\"", "article_summary": "If you looked at that headline and thought, \u201cWhat is the maximum family grant?\u201d you\u2019re probably not alone.\nIf the maximum family grant (MFG) rule were repealed, most households would receive an additional $122 per month.\nThe maximum grant would push families up to 41 percent of the poverty level.\nIn addition to the Western Center on Law and Poverty, the ACLU, Planned Parenthood and the Catholic Conference all support its overturn.\n\u201cDespite the political attractiveness of caps,\u201c writes researcher Michael Wiseman in a 2000 study on welfare policy and children, \u201cthere is little empirical support for expecting them to do much beyond reducing costs."}
