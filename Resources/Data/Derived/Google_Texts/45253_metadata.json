Coal fires up W.Va. House race\n\nThis story is part of an ongoing POLITICO series on how national policy issues are affecting the 2014 midterm elections.\n\nHUNTINGTON, W.Va. \u2014 Deep in coal country, the candidates waging one of the nation\u2019s most closely watched House races are competing to show who is the most outraged by President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental policies.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nDemocratic Rep. Nick Rahall has denounced Obama\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency as \u201c callous,\u201d attacked its biggest greenhouse gas rule as \u201c disastrous\u201d and filed legislation to block the heart of the president\u2019s climate agenda. Republican challenger Evan Jenkins agrees that the EPA\u2019s policies are \u201cdevastating\u201d to West Virginians \u2014 but says the 19-term incumbent championed Obama\u2019s election in 2008 and appears helpless to stop the White House now.\n\nThe state, where an imprisoned felon ran a close second to Obama in the 2012 primary, was always going to provide challenging turf for Democrats this November, but EPA raised the stakes this month by proposing a greenhouse gas rule that could sharply reduce the nation\u2019s reliance on coal. The rule has offered Republicans a wedge issue in House and Senate races across the country, including in the Kentucky contest, where Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is facing Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes.\n\n(See more from POLITICO's All Policy is Local series)\n\nPerhaps more than any other candidate on the ballot, Rahall faces a test: Can red-state Democrats separate themselves from a president so deeply unpopular back home?\n\nHe and his opponent are fighting it out with nearly identical rhetoric.\n\nJenkins, a state senator, promises that \u201cI will never give up on coal,\u201d while Rahall pledges that \u201cwe won\u2019t turn our back on it for a nanosecond.\u201d Both candidates tie the erosion of coal industry jobs to the district\u2019s ever-present poverty and growing drug use. Both put out fliers that talk about \u201cputting West Virginia first.\u201d Both also deride the fire hose of cash flooding into the race from out-of-state spending groups \u2014 although Jenkins describes the groups as \u201canti-coal radical environmental interests,\u201d while Rahall calls them Jenkins\u2019 \u201cpuppet-masters, the Koch brothers.\u201d\n\nJenkins faces the easier task: playing the anti-Obama in one of the most anti-Obama states in the country. Rahall\u2019s job is trickier as he tries to channel his constituents\u2019 despair at what Obama\u2019s administration is doing in his state.\n\n(Also on POLITICO: EPA administrator denies war on coal)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been down before,\u201d Rahall said in an interview at the opening of a campaign office in Huntington, a city of colleges, a large port and technology companies in the state\u2019s southwest corner. \u201cWe\u2019ve come back. But when we\u2019ve been down before, we have felt that the government\u2019s been on our side.\u201d Now, though, \u201cit appears that it\u2019s just blow after blow after blow coming from the EPA.\u201d\n\nRepublicans accuse Rahall of trying to have it both ways, noting that just last summer, he hobnobbed at a ceremony renaming EPA\u2019s headquarters and praised Administrator Gina McCarthy for showing \u201ca genuine willingness to listen\u201d \u2014 yet, by all appearances, couldn\u2019t get the agency to back off its coal regulations. The conservative, Koch-supported American Energy Alliance also has run ads accusing Rahall of supporting a carbon tax, which he denies.\n\nJenkins said in an interview that he reminds people \u201cat every opportunity, this is the guy who was the chief campaigner for Obama in West Virginia.\u201d Rahall was a Democratic superdelegate who endorsed Obama in the 2008 primary.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: SCOTUS nibbles at EPA's powers)\n\n\u201cIt is West Virginians and people of the 3rd Congressional District in particular that are bearing the brunt of this agenda,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what\u2019s so devastating.\u201d\n\nRahall is leading for now in the fundraising race and in some recent polls. But his share of the vote has slipped in the past few elections from 69 percent in 2006 to 54 percent two years ago. Republicans sense a big opportunity in a district where Mitt Romney won 65 percent of the vote in 2012.\n\nStill, \u201cNick Joe\u201d \u2014 as many people here call Rahall \u2014 has some ammunition of his own. He reminds voters of the earmarks he brought to the district in years past, plus his close ties to the late Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd, a still-beloved figure here.\n\nHe acknowledges that the campaign is going to be \u201cvery tough\u201d and that the spending to date is probably just the beginning. Democratic and Republican party committees and PACs have announced plans to spend a total of $3.6 million on the race, in addition to money from groups that don\u2019t have to disclose their outlays.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: GOP plays Steyer card vs. Dems)\n\n\u201cI feel confident, but not overconfident,\u201d Rahall said. \u201cI work every election hard. I don\u2019t take any votes for granted. And I believe in the way my former mentor Robert Byrd used to say \u2014 \u2018There are two ways to run: Unopposed or scared.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2018Hopeless\u2019 in coal country\n\nSimilarities between Rahall and Jenkins go well beyond their expressed dislike for EPA and fealty to coal.\n\nThe candidates align on supporting gun rights, opposing gay marriage and opposing amnesty for undocumented immigrants. They both talk about diversifying West Virginia\u2019s economy, promoting oil and gas, timber, agriculture and the state\u2019s No. 2 industry, tourism. They even both take credit for the state\u2019s Hatfield-McCoy trail system, popular with riders of off-road vehicles \u2014 Jenkins says he sponsored the original state legislation that led to the trail\u2019s creation, while Rahall says he got the project its \u201cseed money.\u201d\n\nWhat space exists between them on campaign issues mainly seems to involve Obamacare and boosting the minimum wage. Rahall voted for Obamacare and has said that \u201cI sleep easy at night, knowing I cast the right vote.\u201d\n\nBut nothing strikes as close to voters\u2019 hearts here as coal.\n\n\u201cThey feel hopeless,\u201d said Christina Underwood, the wife of a pastor and coal miner who sat down with Jenkins and several coal-industry employees at the Nicholas County GOP headquarters in Summersville, in the district\u2019s eastern side. The workers included Roger Thomas, a coal mine electrician who recently returned to work in the area after being away from his wife and seven children for eight months.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t just a job that\u2019s being lost,\u201d said Underwood, whose husband was laid off three times in the past six years. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just coal that\u2019s being a war waged against. It\u2019s Roger. It\u2019s his wife, Eva, and his kids. It\u2019s me, my husband, our kids. I can\u2019t save for them for college. The savings that we had, we had to take out to get us through when we were laid off.\u201d\n\nThe uncertainty eats away at people, Thomas said. \u201cIt\u2019s honestly hard to keep your mind on your job if you don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to have a job. \u2026 You just kind of come out, hope they tell you to bring your bucket back tomorrow.\u201d\n\nSummersville holds the same natural beauty and charm evident across the state \u2014 winding roads dotted with sturdy wooden homes, churches, an old bank and broad, open sky that meets the state\u2019s mountainous terrain. But it\u2019s also home to the problems plaguing all of southern West Virginia: prescription drug abuse and rising heroin addictions, unemployment and a palpable panic for many coal-dependent families.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re living on false hope,\u201d said Mike Grose, owner of Superior and Elite Coal Services, which trains and contracts out miners to coal companies. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with the industry now \u2014 there is no light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s our bailout?\u201d Grose asked.\n\nAnger in coal country is the key to Jenkins\u2019 campaign.\n\nJenkins represents Cabell County in the state Senate and lives here, the state\u2019s second-largest city. But that area is a stronghold for Rahall, while the district\u2019s coal-heavy reaches are where the incumbent lost support in the May 13 primary, when he took 66 percent of the vote.\n\nThat\u2019s why Jenkins was spending a Friday afternoon in June tooling around Summersville with two campaign aides and Nicholas County GOP Chairwoman Benjean Rapp.\n\nJenkins mingled with seniors at Shoney\u2019s, toured Grose\u2019s training shop and met with miners at the local GOP office before scooting off to speak with the county\u2019s main pediatrician, who some locals worry may close up shop, given Medicaid reimbursement troubles.\n\nThe decline of the coal industry is central to the state\u2019s other major issues, Jenkins and his supporters say.\n\n\u201cI think that if you had a well-paid, trained workforce that can take care of themselves, you\u2019re going to have less issues with thievery, drugs, the Medicaid problem that we have, the being on welfare,\u201d Rapp said.\n\nJenkins said that\u2019s the \u201ccore frustration\u201d for him. A good job is \u201cnot going to get everybody off drugs, but there\u2019s a lot of people who have lost hope,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd tragically, where they turn to a lot of times is the pain pills, or now heroin.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Nineteen-term Democratic Rep.
