University of Illinois and University of Arizona\n\nThe days of expensive, invasive surgery to replace batteries in pacemakers and other implantable devices may soon be coming to an end \u2014 although how soon is another question. Researchers have developed a super small device that can harvest electricity from our body\u2019s own organs and use it to power these devices, according to a new study.\n\nThe researchers relied on an electromechanical interaction called piezoelectricity, which involves using certain crystalline materials that become electrically charged whenever they flex or compress \u2014 caused by a moving organ in this case. Using these materials in the form of lead zirconate titanate, and placing them onto extremely thin silicone, the researchers were able to create a rechargeable nanoribbon about one-third the size of a sheet of paper.\n\n\u201cI think the concept of creating electrical power from motions in internal organs is really interesting,\u201d said lead researcher John Rogers, a materials scientist at the University of Illinois, according to New Scientist. \u201cThe key thing is, if you\u2019re going to do this, you need to be able to achieve efficiency and ultimately power output that is of practical use.\u201d\n\nRogers and his team tested the device on sheep, cows, and pigs, all of which have hearts, lungs, and diaphragms similar in shape and size to humans. They found that it was able to produce up to eight volts of electricity \u2014 up to five times more power than previous studies \u2014 and enough to both AC/DC conversion devices and microbatteries that pacemakers plug into, Popular Mechanics reported.\n\nWhile the device is promising, there\u2019s still a lot of work that needs to be done. The team still has to test the device out over a longer term, since the current study only tested the nanoribbon for a few hours. \u201cThis won\u2019t be available for practical use anytime soon,\u201d Rogers said, according to HealthDay. \u201cSo far, we have shown it lasts for \u2026 half a day or so, but we will have to show that this method will generate sufficient electricity for at least a decade, because if not, there\u2019s no point.\u201d\n\nPatients with pacemakers and defibrillators typically undergo surgery to have a dying battery replaced every seven to 10 years, Daniel Inman, chairman of the Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Michigan, told HealthDay. But \u201cthere\u2019s no question that there\u2019s certainly a need and demand,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you tell them this method would mean they don\u2019t have to do that anymore, that is something they definitely want.\u201d\n\nSource: Dagdeviren C, Yang B, Su Y, et al.
