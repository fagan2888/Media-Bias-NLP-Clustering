You have recently run two articles concerning firewood. The earlier article quoted the Texas Forest Service warning not to buy or burn firewood that was not locally grown.

The spread of fire ants and other highly unwanted creatures was the reason.

The second article promoted the burning of pine or oak —- neither of which is grown in this vicinity. In the second article, you quoted firewood “sellers” but failed to get information from firewood “users.”

Advice from a person who burns a fire every cold morning and most cold evenings should be included. That’s where I come in.

Generally speaking, there are two kinds of fires people want: The first is a roaring fire that puts out heat. No wood beats mesquite for this purpose. The second is a real wood fire that does not use a lot of wood. One where a little (very local, very cheap) wood will last a long time. That kind comes from elm — the kind that grows in most back yards.

Elm, particularly “green” elm, rarely has a flame, it must be nurtured by a very slow gas flame, but glows a long time with slow burning coals. If you want to build a fire in the evening and have glowing coals the next morning, nothing beats elm.

Neither mesquite nor elm will “pop” and create a spark danger, a claim that cannot be made for either pinion or oak.
