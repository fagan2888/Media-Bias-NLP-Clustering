Two-thirds said they eliminated Medicaid coverage for prisoners when they went behind bars, and 21 percent suspended coverage. Of these systems, however, more than two-thirds helped prisoners get back on Medicaid upon their release, the survey found.\n\nMore than one-third of the state prison systems check into whether prisoners are eligible for Medicaid when they need treatment behind bars.\n\nThings have changed since 2000, when almost all states cut off Medicaid when prisoners were incarcerated.\n\n\"The difficult reality is that terminating Medicaid during incarceration, which is what is occurring in the majority of prison systems today, can be harmful to this population, as well as costly to the general public,\" Rich said. \"Instead, we should be moving toward using this period of incarceration as an opportunity to reduce expensive post-incarceration emergency-room and inpatient hospital care.\"\n\nThe study appeared online Jan. 16 in the American Journal of Public Health.\n\nMore information\n\nFor more on Medicaid, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "https://consumer.healthday.com/public-health-information-30/economic-status-health-news-224/more-prisons-helping-inmates-enroll-in-medicaid-at-release-survey-683929.html", "image": "https://media.healthday.com/images/editorial/Clj091ml.jpg", "site_name": "Consumer HealthDay", "description": "With expanded program eligibility, fresh start could include better health care", "title": "More Prisons Helping Inmates Enroll in Medicaid at Release: Survey"}, "description": "With expanded program eligibility, fresh start could include better health care", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=2.0,user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd092d\"", "article_summary": "Two-thirds said they eliminated Medicaid coverage for prisoners when they went behind bars, and 21 percent suspended coverage.\nOf these systems, however, more than two-thirds helped prisoners get back on Medicaid upon their release, the survey found.\nThe findings come as some states expand the number of low-income people who are eligible for medical coverage through Medicaid.\nMore than one-third of the state prison systems check into whether prisoners are eligible for Medicaid when they need treatment behind bars.\nFRIDAY, Jan. 17, 2014 (HealthDay News) -- Some prison systems are enrolling prisoners in Medicaid to lower costs and help inmates have health care when they're released, a new study finds."}
