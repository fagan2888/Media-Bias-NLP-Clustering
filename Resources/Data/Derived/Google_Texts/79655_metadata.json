A campaign statement issued slightly later said the event would be held on another unnamed day.\n\nFollowing the announcement, the crowd began to chant and cheer. Scuffles broke out as signs were ripped from hands and police moved in to break up areas with the most serious conflicts.\n\nCries of \u201cWe dumped Trump! We dumped Trump!\u201d rose inside the University of Illinois at Chicago pavilion where the event was held.\n\nAn opposing group yelled, \u201cWe want Trump! We want Trump!\u201d\n\nOutside the pavilion, chants of \"We shut it down!\" rippled through the crowd on news of the cancellation.\n\nTrump decided to postpone the event after arriving in Chicago and meeting with law enforcement, his campaign said.\n\nChicago activists had spent the week leading up to the rally planning how to disrupt it.\n\nOne group, Showing Up for Racial Justice, coordinated with minority student groups on local campuses, using group email chains and messaging so that protesters could stay in constant communication.\n\nOne of the organizers, Nathaniel Lewis, 25, a master\u2019s degree student in public health at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said he was shocked they succeeded in shutting the rally down.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy, I\u2019m at peace because we came together as a collective,\u201d Lewis told Reuters. \u201cThis is the last thing we expected to happen, it shows the power of unity.\u201d\n\nReporting by Emily Flitter and Fiona Ortiz; Writing by Amanda Becker", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled a rally scheduled for Friday night in Chi", "title": "Trump Cancels Chicago Rally Fearing More Crowd Violence", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/11/Trump-Cancels-Chicago-Rally-Fearing-More-Crowd-Violence", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTX28SPC.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/11/Trump-Cancels-Chicago-Rally-Fearing-More-Crowd-Violence", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/RTX28SPC.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled a rally scheduled for Friday night in Chi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "A Trump campaign staffer took the stage nearly a half hour after the rally was slated to begin and said it would be postponed for safety reasons.\nWe dumped Trump!\u201d rose inside the University of Illinois at Chicago pavilion where the event was held.\nTrump decided to postpone the event after arriving in Chicago and meeting with law enforcement, his campaign said.\nChicago activists had spent the week leading up to the rally planning how to disrupt it.\nA campaign statement issued slightly later said the event would be held on another unnamed day."}
