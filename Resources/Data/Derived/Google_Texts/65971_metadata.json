Rep. Mitzi Johnson, D-South Hero, chair of House Appropriations, spent two days trying to finalize the bill with GOP and Democratic members who refused to give on positions. Johnson described the approval process as \u201ca big lift with a lot of tough choices.\u201d\n\nMost of the big issues were addressed early on, and as the committee neared a final vote, the disputes were over how to spend a small pot of leftover money \u2014 and a $10.3 million problem that remains unresolved.\n\nA $67.4 million overspend in Medicaid was the biggest portion of the mid-year adjustment. The Shumlin administration and lawmakers used $10 million from general fund, $10.3 million in one-time money from the state health care resources fund and $47 million in federal funds to cover the unanticipated costs. Under the Affordable Care Act, the state has expanded Medicaid to Vermonters who previously were uninsured. The ballooning number of Medicaid patients (about 200,000, or a third of the state\u2019s population) is driving up costs. Another $10 million in unanticipated state spending was covered by small bumps in revenues from a variety of funds.\n\nThe administration\u2019s original plan included $7 million for the Department for Children and Families, some $3.3 million of which would have come out of the general fund, to cover the cost of hiring new social workers for the 1,370 children now in state custody. Andy Pallito, commissioner of the Department of Finance and Management, reduced the state expenditure on DCF by $310,000 on Tuesday as part of a plan to address a $3.22 million downgrade in general fund revenues. (The package also included a transfer of remaining funds, $425,000, from the Vermont Enterprise Fund to the bottom line for the budget adjustment.)\n\nMost of the fraught discussion in committee was not about the Medicaid hole or $3 million in adjustments made by the Shumlin administration in response to a revenue downgrade on Tuesday.\n\nThe debate was over $550,000 in available funds and the vexing problem the Shumlin administration left for lawmakers to resolve \u2014 a 53rd week of Medicaid that was not included in the original fiscal year 2016 budget.\n\nJohnson says the Shumlin administration didn\u2019t tell lawmakers in House Appropriations about the 53rd week issue until last fall. As Rep. Kathleen Keenan, D-St. Albans, put it, the Legislature passed a budget last year with a built-in deficit.\n\nThat deficit hasn\u2019t gone away. The $10.3 million shortfall in Medicaid, which is an obligation on the state\u2019s books for fiscal year 2016, now must be addressed in the governor\u2019s 2017 budget.\n\nThe shortfall complicated the closure of the budget adjustment act.\n\nMembers of the committee argued for hours over how to spend the available $550,000. Should they apply it to the 53rd week? Should they tap $900,000, the maximum allowable amount, from a $6.8 million rainy day fund to help pay for the deficit? What about the Shumlin administration\u2019s proposal to hire more social workers to address the heavy caseloads that Rep. Kitty Toll, D-Danville, in an emotional plea said led to the deaths of two children and a social worker?\n\n\u201cI would put the money toward the children so there is some kind of signal from this building that there is a problem,\u201d Toll said.\n\n\u201cI agree with Kitty, we have an obligation, aside from our political stripes. We\u2019re here to serve Vermonters,\u201d Rep. Anne O\u2019Brien, D-Richmond, said. \u201cMy hope is for a compromise. We do have differences, and I have a lot of faith we can work through those differences with each side giving up a little.\u201d\n\nRepublicans threatened to vote no on the bill if the committee refused to address the 53rd week problem. Democrats were equally dug in on sending additional money to DCF.\n\nJohnson implored committee members to reach a compromise. \u201cI want to put something on table so people don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s only one path, yes or no,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard on the fiscal year 2016 budget in total. If we could change things that would make you more comfortable and get to place where people can support it great. If there are major differences we understand there are yeses and nos for many people.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have that luxury, I\u2019m chair and we need budget adjustment,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI need to vote yes. I\u2019d like to get to the best thing we can. I have to vote yes \u2014 even on the pieces that I hate.\u201d\n\nReps. Bob Helm, R-Fair Haven, and Marty Feltus, R-Lyndonville, were adamant that the committee had to put some money toward the 53rd week problem. When Dems offered an olive branch \u2014 dividing up the $550,000 between DCF and the 53rd week \u2014 they relented.\n\nIn the end, they decided not to use rainy day funds to help plug the 53rd week hole. Instead, in a symbolic gesture, lawmakers applied $225,000 from available funds to the $10.3 million problem. The remaining $225,000 was divided up between the Department for Children and Families ($190,000) and the expansion of a needle exchange program ($35,000).\n\nCORRECTIONS: This article originally said the 53rd week was a Pay Act issue. That was incorrect. The $10.3 million hole is from a 53rd week Medicaid payout that was not included in the fiscal year 2016 budget. Also, Rep. Bob Helm lives in Fair Haven, not Barnard. The FY 2016 budget is $1.47 billion, not $1.55 billion as first reported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Appropriations approved the mid-year budget adjustment on Wednesday, 1/20/16", "og": {"site_name": "VTDigger", "description": "House Appropriations approved the mid-year budget adjustment on Wednesday, 1/20/16", "title": "House budget panel approves mid-year adjustment | VTDigger", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mitzi-Johnson_.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-21T12:14:25+00:00", "url": "http://vtdigger.org/2016/01/21/house-budget-panel-approves-mid-year-adjustment/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "House Appropriations approved the mid-year budget adjustment on Wednesday, 1/20/16", "creator": "@vtdigger", "image": "http://i2.wp.com/vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Mitzi-Johnson_.jpg?fit=1024%2C768", "title": "House budget panel approves mid-year adjustment | VTDigger", "site": "@vtdigger", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "keywords": "budget adjustment, Vermont Legislature", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/vtdigger", "section": "Business & Economy", "tag": "budget adjustment 2016", "published_time": "2016-01-21T06:08:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-21T12:14:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "budget adjustment 2016, vermont, vermont news, vermont events, vermont press releases"}, "article_summary": "Johnson says the Shumlin administration didn\u2019t tell lawmakers in House Appropriations about the 53rd week issue until last fall.\nThe $10.3 million hole is from a 53rd week Medicaid payout that was not included in the fiscal year 2016 budget.\nThe House Appropriations Committee approved a plan on Wednesday for adjusting the state\u2019s $1.47 billion fiscal year 2016 budget by $88.9 million.\nThe FY 2016 budget is $1.47 billion, not $1.55 billion as first reported.\nWhen Dems offered an olive branch \u2014 dividing up the $550,000 between DCF and the 53rd week \u2014 they relented."}
