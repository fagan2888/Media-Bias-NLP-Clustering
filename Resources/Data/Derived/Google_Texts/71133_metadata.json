(Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports)\n\nMickelson's missed putt allows Taylor to prevail at Pebble Beach\n\n\n\nJourneyman Vaughn Taylor ended a PGA Tour title drought of more than a decade with an explosive back nine to clinch a one-shot win over Phil Mickelson at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in California on Sunday.\n\n..\n\nTaylor began the final round six strokes off the pace but five birdies after the turn propelled him to a closing seven-under-par 65 at a blustery Pebble Beach Golf Links as he posted a winning total of 17-under 270.\n\n..\n\nOvernight leader Mickelson, seeking his first PGA Tour win since the 2013 British Open, lipped out a five-foot birdie putt at the last hole that would have forced a playoff. Mickelson had to settle for second place after carding a roller-coaster 72.\n\n..\n\nSwede Jonas Blixt, one of four players who held at least a share of the lead in the final round, was another stroke back in third at 15 under after shooting a 69.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time and I didn\u2019t think it was going to happen,\u201d an emotional Taylor, 39, told CBS Sports after clinching his first PGA Tour win since the 2005 Reno-Tahoe Open, and his third overall.\n\n..\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve worked so hard and just kept getting knocked down and knocked down,\u201d said Taylor, who has not played a full season on the PGA Tour since 2012 while bouncing between it and the satellite Web.com tour over the past three seasons.\n\n..\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it actually happened again. Just amazing. I\u2019m at a loss for words right now. I didn\u2019t even have my tour card and got in this week on past champion status, and now I\u2019m playing in the Masters pretty soon. It\u2019s a dream come true.\u201d\n\n..\n\nTaylor had moved into a share of the lead for the first time with a tap-in birdie at the 15th, then drained a 28-footer at the par-four 16th to edge one ahead before clinching the winner\u2019s check for $1.26 million.\n\n..\n\nMickelson, a four-time champion at Pebble Beach, struggled with his iron play for much of the day and needed to finish birdie-birdie to force a playoff after sinking a clutch par putt from 12 feet at the 16th hole.\n\n..\n\nHe made the first of them, rolling in a tricky 13-footer from the back of the green at the par-three 17th, but lipped out for birdie from short range at the par-five 18th just when he seemed headed for a playoff.\n\n..\n\n\u201cI am not quite where I want to be yet and I am a little bit more determined to get it back,\u201d said Mickelson, who had been aiming to match Mark O\u2019Meara\u2019s record five wins at Pebble Beach. \u201cI also know that I am close.\n\n..\n\n\u201cAs nervous as I was and as disappointed as I am that I didn\u2019t win, this was so much fun for me to get back into the thick of it, to feel the pressure, to make a couple of clutch putts on 16 and 17.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt never crossed my mind that one on 18 wouldn\u2019t go in.\u201d\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "Journeyman Vaughn Taylor ended a PGA Tour title drought of more than a decade with an explosive back nine to clinch a one-shot win over Phil Mickelson at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in California on Sunday.", "title": "Mickelson's missed putt allows Taylor to prevail at Pebble Beach | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "Journeyman Vaughn Taylor ended a PGA Tour title drought of more than a decade with an explosive back nine to clinch a one-shot win over Phil Mickelson at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in California on Sunday.", "title": "Mickelson's missed putt allows Taylor to prevail at Pebble Beach | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20160214/SPORTS05/160219482/1003/sports05", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20160214/SPORTS05/160219482/AR/0/AR-160219482.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=80", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Golf", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "keywords": "Golf,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2016-02-14 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "Journeyman Vaughn Taylor ended a PGA Tour title drought of more than a decade with an explosive back nine to clinch a one-shot win over Phil Mickelson at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in California on Sunday.", "title": "Mickelson's missed putt allows Taylor to prevail at Pebble Beach | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20160214/SPORTS05/160219482/1003/sports05", "image": "/storyimage/UL/20160214/SPORTS05/160219482/AR/0/AR-160219482.jpg?q=70", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Phil Mickelson reacts after missing his birdie putt on the 18th hole during the final round of the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am at Pebble Beach Golf Links.\n(Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports)Mickelson's missed putt allows Taylor to prevail at Pebble BeachJourneyman Vaughn Taylor ended a PGA Tour title drought of more than a decade with an explosive back nine to clinch a one-shot win over Phil Mickelson at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in California on Sunday.\n..Overnight leader Mickelson, seeking his first PGA Tour win since the 2013 British Open, lipped out a five-foot birdie putt at the last hole that would have forced a playoff.\n..Taylor began the final round six strokes off the pace but five birdies after the turn propelled him to a closing seven-under-par 65 at a blustery Pebble Beach Golf Links as he posted a winning total of 17-under 270.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time and I didn\u2019t think it was going to happen,\u201d an emotional Taylor, 39, told CBS Sports after clinching his first PGA Tour win since the 2005 Reno-Tahoe Open, and his third overall."}
