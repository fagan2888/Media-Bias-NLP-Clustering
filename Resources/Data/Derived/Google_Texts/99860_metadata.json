It seemed to settle down until this month when a concerned citizen spotted the Meitiv kids unaccompanied near a neighborhood park and called in Child Protective Services. For the past week, one issue has dominated the airwaves: How much suggested parental guidance is too much, or not enough?\n\nThe Meitivs are outspoken proponents of what\u2019s known as \u201cFree Range Parenting,\u201d meaning they think kids should be left to their own devices. They think kids will grow up better without constant parental attention. Clearly, they need to get with the program, which is why I\u2019m offering to set them straight:\n\nDear Stupid, Stupid Meitivs,\n\nGive me a break! Your antiquated parenting style is outdated. It may have worked back in our parents\u2019 days when \u201cFree Range Parenting\u201d was still known by its old school name, \u201cParenting.\u201d But it\u2019s now considered dangerous and chuckle-headed.\n\nModern, educated \u201cHelicopter\u201d parents understand that children must at all times be accompanied by an adult, either a parent, guardian, or, during the work week, by a complete stranger, undocumented and working under the table. An adult must always make all kids\u2019 decisions for them, guide their every activity and offer words of encouragement, even when the child screws up.\n\nAbove all, the modern child must be scheduled. Every free moment must be filled with what\u2019s known as an \u201cActivity.\u201d Only outmoded, uncompetitive kids \u201cPlay\u201d anymore. Activities can be athletic, academic, or career-enhancing, but they must never, if possible, be any fun.\n\nAt minimum, today\u2019s kid must be enrolled in a team sport. Average parents will settle for things like volleyball or soccer. But let\u2019s be honest, Mr. and Mrs. M. Those sports doom kids to a life of average expectations and a career in middle management. More thoughtful parents choose elitist activities like lacrosse, tennis or equestrian sports (horse riding for you rubes out there). The sport should also include all-consuming private coaching, travel teams and expensive equipment, or it\u2019s clearly not going to make your kid thrive. The more stress, the better.\n\nRemember, you\u2019ve got to break a few eggs to make an omelet. As parents, you must be ready to step in and make sure your child is named to the starting lineup, no matter how talented or motivated Junior might be. Coaches might act tough, but they\u2019re no match for an angry, vindictive parent.\n\nModern kids also cannot be allowed to go through the school system on their own.\n\nSchools these days focus only on learning, where \u201cHelicopter\u201d parents know the real goal is getting ahead, preparing them to crush future competitors into the dirt.\n\nPrivate tutoring goes without saying, as does constant lobbying calls to schools to keep the pressure on teachers (the squeaky wheel gets the A\u2019s!) (Special Note: Teachers are even more vulnerable than coaches. A teacher can be made to cry in seconds.)\n\nStandardized testing, such as the SATs, are meant to find out where your child ranks in the relative scheme of things, under normal circumstances so they can be placed in the right school. You must not allow this to happen, Mr. and Mrs. M.! Your tots can\u2019t end up in the right school, they must end up in the BEST school! The modern teenager must be plumped and prodded with specialized training leading up to the SAT, even if it causes stress, so they do better than they would if you let the test truly measure natural ability. If Junior doesn\u2019t puke before the SATs, he\u2019s not taking it seriously enough. Think of it like a baseball player on steroids. It may cause long-term damage, but think of all those home runs!\n\nI also note from reading news stories that both of you Meitivs are scientists. This explains a lot. Evidently you never got the memo. Modern Americans no longer believe in \u201cScience.\u201d As a matter of fact, if educational reforms continue as expected, science will be completely eliminated from the curriculum in the near future. You don\u2019t want your children to grow up to be pariahs. Instead, encourage them to work toward careers that contribute to modern society. I suggest either sports management or reality television.\n\nAll of this must come as a shock to you, Mr. and Mrs. M. But you have to face facts.\n\nYou are free thinkers in a society where nothing is free anymore, especially not children.\n\nRemember, if your kids don\u2019t have ulcers by the age of 12, you\u2019re not doing your job as parents!
