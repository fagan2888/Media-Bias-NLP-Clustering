Bankruptcy Beat readers, meet The Examiners.

We’re launching a new recurring feature on the blog where we’ll pose a monthly restructuring question to a panel of restructuring experts. Like their namesake, our Examiners—a great group of top restructuring lawyers, financial advisers, investment bankers, investors and law professors—will examine timely topics and share their insight, bringing light to complex and important issues.

Over the coming months, we’ll also encourage you, our readers, to weigh in and share your views as well. We want to launch a thought-provoking conversation, and we hope you’ll join in.

Read on to meet The Examiners and the first question they’ll tackle. And check back later this month as we start posting their answers.

Question: Interest rates that remain near zero and debt maturities that have been pushed out to 2017 and 2018 have helped drive Chapter 11 filings to historic lows. Has this difficult environment put corporate restructuring on life support?
