Marsha Blackburn has been named the 2016 Woman of the Year by the Clare Boothe Luce Policy Institute.\n\nBlackburn accepted her award Friday during the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md. The event was only open to female college students attending the conference, over 200 of which were present during the ceremony.\n\n\u201cWe work exclusively with younger women. So this event is really to put up Marsha Blackburn as a role model,\u201d Program Director Laurel Conrad said.\n\nThe CBLPI is a nonprofit think tank founded in 1993 that prepares young women for leadership by providing them with inspiration and mentorship from established conservative women. The institute also supports and promotes female conservative politicians and activists.\n\nThe organization gave Blackburn its Conservative Leadership Award in 2007, and she frequently attends and speaks at its events.\n\n\u201cThe Clare Boothe Luce Policy Institute has done a tremendous job of not only encouraging young women to lead in their communities, but preparing them with the tools they need to fight for conservative, constitutional principles,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cIt was an honor to accept this award in a room full of young women who are the future of the conservative movement.\u201d\n\nBlackburn also regularly appears in the organization\u2019s annual Great American Conservative Women photo calendar. The calendar is designed for female college students who share the institute\u2019s views.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nice little reminder that there are conservative women,\u201d President Michelle Eaton said.\n\nEaton said the CBLPI selects its Woman of the Year through discussions with staff but also the young women it serves.\n\n\u201cWe look for one who\u2019s been great always, but especially this year,\u201d she said. \u201cMarsha is a wonderful role model who\u2019s excellent in conservative policy and leadership.\u201d\n\nBlackburn was selected this year in part because of her defense of pro-life arguments, Eaton said.\n\nIn October 2015, Blackburn was appointed chair of the congressional committee tasked with investigating Planned Parenthood. She also criticized a poll concerning women\u2019s health released by Vanderbilt University in Dec. 2015. Blackburn accused the university of trying to advance a pro-choice agenda by not specifically asking in the poll about abortions provided by Planned Parenthood.\n\nEaton said the CBLPI also chose Blackburn based on her opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Blackburn has frequently voted to defund the program, most recently on Jan. 17.\n\nThe senator\u2019s character and demeanor throughout her career are another reason the CBLPI selected her for the award.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s strong and principled but she makes these arguments in such a gracious way,\u201d Eaton said.\n\nEaton said Blackburn is an excellent role model for the young women the organization supports.\n\n\u201cMarsha is very inspiring to young women,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cYou can be strong and successful but still feminine.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tennessee Sen.
