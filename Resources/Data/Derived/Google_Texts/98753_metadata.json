Not only does it take aim at restaurants, but, depending on its final language, the rule could also apply to grocery stores, convenience stores, gas stations and movie theaters that sell prepared food.\n\nThe nation\u2019s eateries are faced with the costly prospect of having to calculate the number of calories in the various meals they serve.\n\n\u201cNot every steak is exactly the same,\u201d says Scott DeFife, executive vice president of policy and government affairs at the National Restaurant Industry. \u201cThe slightest variation in how I cut the steak and serve it can affect the nutritional content.\u201d\n\nThe FDA\u2019s menu labeling rule, a requirement of ObamaCare, was proposed more than three years ago. It was formally submitted to the White House for final review in April, prompting a flurry of meetings between administration officials and groups trying to influence its final form.\n\nThe FDA had anticipated a final rule being issued over the summer, but interests on both sides of the issue are still waiting \u2014 and expect an announcement at any time.\n\nA regulation that hews closely to the proposed rule would be problematic for the food industry, groups said.\n\nThe draft language would require restaurants and grocery chains with more than 20 locations that devote more than half of their floor space to selling food to list the number of calories in each item of food they prepare.\n\nPublic health groups say the rule could improve people\u2019s diets, because it will give them a better idea of how many calories they\u2019re eating.\n\n\u201cIf someone is going to serve you thousands of calories, the least they could do is tell you how many calories it has,\u201d said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n\nBut restaurants and grocery stores are concerned they\u2019ll be required to recount the number of calories in a meal every time they tinker with a recipe, which they say would be nearly impossible to do considering the endless number of food combinations they sell.\n\nAt McDonald\u2019s, for instance, a Big Mac is usually 550 calories, but it could be more for a customer who orders extra cheese.\n\nIt\u2019s even more complicated for pizza joints.\n\nDomino\u2019s says there are 34 million potential combinations of its pizza that go well beyond a customer deciding between toppings like pepperoni and sausage. They also must factor in whether it\u2019s a large, medium, or small pizza, deep dish or thin crust, and any extra ingredients.\n\nSome restaurants like Domino\u2019s have already begun disclosing the calories of their pizzas when customers order online. The difficulty, it says, is disclosing the calories in every possible pizza on a printed menu in the store.\n\n\u201cPizza is so customizable that it\u2019s literally impossible to put all the calorie information on a menu,\u201d said Lynn Liddle, executive vice president of Domino\u2019s and chairwoman of the American Pizza Community.\n\nThe National Restaurant Association is calling on the FDA to give restaurants some \u201cflexibility\" when it comes to counting calories.\n\n\u201cWe want to see how much flexibility there will be on serving sizes,\" DeFife said.\n\nOne scenario that has attracted support is from pizza restaurants to list the calories in a cheese pizza along with the calories in each topping, so customers can add the numbers up for themselves.\n\nLikewise, burger joints like McDonald\u2019s might only be required to list the calories in sandwiches that are on the menu, but not for unpredictable special orders from customers.\n\nGrocery stores are experiencing the same concerns, facing what they say is $1 billion in compliance costs in the first year alone.\n\nThey say 95 percent of the food they sell \u2014 like breakfast cereal, potato chips, milk \u2014 already lists nutritional information including the number of calories.\n\nBut the menu labeling requirements would target their delis, bakeries and any fresh fruit they slice up and put in containers to sell.\n\nGrocery stores could end up paying a lab anywhere from $750 to $1,500 to come up with a calorie count for each item of prepared food they sell, according to Rob Rosado, director of government relations at the Food Marketing Institute.\n\nThat could push many grocery stores to close up their delis and bakeries and stop offering fresh fruit, Rosado says, while those delis that stay open would be limited to a very specific recipe, which Rosado says would be infeasible.\n\n\u201cI might sell chicken noodle soup every day, but some days I might use thigh meat, and other days I might use breast meat, or more noodles, rice, carrots, or celery,\u201d Rosado said. \u201cAll of that varies based on what\u2019s available in the store that day.\"\n\nThe same is true for gas stations and convenience stores like 7-Eleven that may sell fresh hotdogs or slices of pizza.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t test every option that a customer would want,\u201d says Lyle Beckwith, senior vice president of government relations at the National Association of Convenience Stores, which represents 7-Eleven.\n\nBut public health groups say the rules should apply evenly to restaurants, grocery stores and convenience stores alike.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t really make sense to have Pizza Hut\u2019s salad bar covered, but not a grocery store\u2019s salad bar, or the bakery items at Panera, but not at Safeway or Whole Foods,\u201d Wootan said.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether the food is purchased from a restaurant or a supermarket, that food will have the same effect on people\u2019s diets and their health no matter where it is sold,\u201d she added.\n\nWootan would also like to see movie theaters included in the menu labeling requirements.\n\nShe seems to have support from the congressional authors of the menu labeling requirements, Sen. Tom Harkin Tom HarkinDo candidates care about our health or just how much it costs? The Hill's 12:30 Report Mark Mellman: Parsing the primary processes MORE (D-Iowa) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), who not only believe restaurants and grocery stores should be covered, but also movie houses, miniature golf courses, amusement parks and any other venue that serves prepared food.\n\nThe two lawmakers have written numerous letters to the FDA saying they are disappointed with how \u201cnarrow\u201d the rule is.\n\n\u201cIn fact, Congress intended the scope of the disclosure law to extend to movie theaters, bowling alleys, bookstore cafes, and other like establishments, which is the very reason Congress used the phrase \u2018and similar retail establishments\u2019 in the statute to extend the reach of the law beyond restaurants,\u201d the lawmakers wrote.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The forthcoming ObamaCare regulation will require nutritional information on menus.", "description": "The forthcoming ObamaCare regulation will require nutritional information on menus.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Tim Devaney", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The forthcoming ObamaCare regulation will require nutritional information on menus.", "title": "Restaurants brace for calorie labeling rule", "url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/225201-restaurants-brace-for-calorie-disclosure-rule", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/mcdonalds11242014getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T04:47-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/regulation/225201-restaurants-brace-for-calorie-disclosure-rule", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-11-24T13:48-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ben Goad", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-24T13:48:09-05:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T04:47:50-05:00"}, "keywords": ",Tom Harkin,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/regulation/225201-restaurants-brace-for-calorie-disclosure-rule", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The forthcoming ObamaCare regulation will require nutritional information on menus.", "card": "summary", "title": "Restaurants brace for calorie labeling rule"}, "dcterms.title": "Restaurants brace for calorie labeling rule"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfec1\"", "article_summary": "But public health groups say the rules should apply evenly to restaurants, grocery stores and convenience stores alike.\nRestaurants are bracing for new calorie disclosure regulations they say could trim their profit margins as much as their customers\u2019 waistlines.\nNot only does it take aim at restaurants, but, depending on its final language, the rule could also apply to grocery stores, convenience stores, gas stations and movie theaters that sell prepared food.\nGrocery stores are experiencing the same concerns, facing what they say is $1 billion in compliance costs in the first year alone.\n\u201cThe slightest variation in how I cut the steak and serve it can affect the nutritional content.\u201dThe FDA\u2019s menu labeling rule, a requirement of ObamaCare, was proposed more than three years ago."}
