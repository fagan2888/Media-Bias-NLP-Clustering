Burglary suspects were caught on surveillance smashing a front door at a liquor store and then climbing inside.

Fountain police are hoping someone will recognize the suspects from surveillance images.

The two men broke into the Mountain Post Liquors on 6336 S. Highway 85 just before 1:20 Friday morning. A witness spotted the burglary unfolding and called police. By the time officers got on scene, the suspects had taken off, but their images were caught on camera.

The suspects are believed to be a white man and a black man, and were seen in a late-model Red Chevy Silverado extended cab. If you have any information about the robbery, you are asked to call the Fountain Police Department at 382-8555.
