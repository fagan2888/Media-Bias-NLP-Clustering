They tossed out the usual talking points, but avoided the elephant in the room \u2014 real healthcare reform.\n\nThen, during the audience Q&A, a certain MedCity News reporter stood up and called Tanden on one of her earlier statements: that the U.S. healthcare sector needed to \u201cmaintain quality\u201d while dealing with expansion of coverage to millions of previously uninsured people.\n\nThe problem is, quality of American healthcare isn\u2019t exactly something to be proud of.\n\nA group called Patient Safety America has said that medical error is the third-leading cause of death in the United States, killing as many as 440,000 people a year. Even supposedly prestigious institutions have unexpectedly high error rates, and providers routinely try to hide their mistakes.\n\nSession moderator, USA Today reporter Jayne O\u2019Donnell, who has been on the healthcare beat for just a couple of years, said she was \u201cshocked\u201d when she heard the Patient Safety America numbers a few months ago.\n\nIn attempting to answer the question, Tanden mentioned the fundamental issue of trying to communicate complex issues in a society that loves sound bites. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about quality and outcomes,\u201d Tanden said.\n\nTanden noted that there is a \u201cdeep and fundamental skepticism\u201d about government regulating the practice of medicine. She recalled the debate about Medicare paying physicians for end-of-life counseling and of comparative-effectiveness research. Both ideas are in the Affordable Care Act, though the public didn\u2019t hear much about either except under the guise of the headline-friendly \u201cdeath panels\u201d smear.\n\nMiller, no fan of the ACA, mostly agreed that it was easier to discuss costs and coverage than quality and safety. He suggested that the government needed to \u201cregulate less and inform more\u201d \u2014 and at one point mildly praised the Obama administration for at least attempting to advance price transparency. (That was before the certain MedCity News correspondent steered the conversation toward safety.)\n\nIn talking about quality of care, Miller briefly referred to Meaningful Use as \u201cmeaningless\u201d these days, and Tanden concurred. Both also agreed that the ACA is not going away, despite the promises of Republican presidential candidates.\n\nSee, folks, there is common ground to be found out there.
