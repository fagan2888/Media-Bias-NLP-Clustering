The President has already threatened to reject 13 GOP-sponsored pieces of legislation, including bills rolling back the Affordable Care Act and reversing his executive action on immigration.\n\nOn Keystone, it appears unlikely GOP lawmakers will be able to reverse Obama\u2019s veto. The threshold for overriding a President\u2019s veto is a two-thirds vote in each chamber of Congress.\n\nAfter the President\u2019s official veto message was received in the Senate at about 3:30 p.m., Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced the veto override will happen no later than next Tuesday.\n\nThe measure, which passed the Republican controlled House and Senate earlier this month, would have bypassed an administration review of the oil pipeline project, which if completed would transport oil from tar sands in Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nAdvocates \u2014 including Republican leaders in Congress and the government of Canada \u2014 say Keystone would create American jobs, but opponents argue the potential environmental risks aren\u2019t worth it.\n\nThe White House said they opposed the GOP-bill because it usurped the President\u2019s authority to approve or deny the creation of the pipeline, which was first proposed more than six years ago. Since then, the project has been the subject of administration review, including the current State Department analysis that\u2019s been underway for years.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said on Tuesday it was still a possibility that Obama approves the pipeline once the State Department review is complete, but didn\u2019t reveal a time line for that scenario.\n\nObama himself has downplayed the economic benefits of the pipeline, saying America\u2019s energy strategy should encompass more than a single project.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s set our sights higher than a single oil pipeline,\u201d he said during January\u2019s State of the Union address.\n\nRepublicans on Tuesday said the expected veto sets a sour tone for any further cooperation.\n\nDownload Fox 5 iPhone app | Download Fox 5 Android app\n\nPREVIOUS STORY", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "38.897676;-77.036530", "description": "WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama, exercising his veto power for the first time in five years, rejected on Tuesday a measure green-lighting the construction of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "FOX5 San Diego - San Diego News, Weather, Traffic and Sports | KSWB", "description": "WASHINGTON \u2013 President Barack Obama, exercising his veto power for the first time in five years, rejected on Tuesday a measure green-lighting the construction of the controversial Keystone XL\u2026", "title": "President Obama vetoes Keystone XL pipeline bill", "url": "http://fox5sandiego.com/2015/02/24/president-obama-vetoes-keystone-xl-oil-pipeline/", "image": {"width": 692, "identifier": "https://tribkswb.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/president-barack-obama.gif", "height": 384}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://tribkswb.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/president-barack-obama.gif?w=640"}, "site": "@fox5sandiego", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox5sandiego"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Get the latest San Diego news, breaking news, weather, traffic, sports, entertainment and video from fox5sandiego.com.
