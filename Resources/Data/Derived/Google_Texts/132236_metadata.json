As he surfed around he began seeing ads for pregnancy-related merchandise from Target, one of his daughter\u2019s favorite stores. Turns out they knew she was pregnant before he did because of her on-line shopping habits.\n\nIf you think you\u2019ve protected your privacy by deleting your cookies, installing the latest anti-virus software, and setting high browser security levels, you don\u2019t know how determined some software developers are to track your every move.\n\nRelated: The Privacy Illusion\u2014Why We Gave It Up Years Ago\n\nThe first large-scale study of advanced web tracking mechanisms, conducted by researchers at Princeton University and KU Leuven University in Belgium, reveals that people are unwillingly tracked online far more than previously thought.\n\nThe newly developed form of user tracking, called \u201ccanvas fingerprinting,\u201d works like this: You click on a website and your web browser is automatically told to draw an image. It\u2019s one you can\u2019t see, and here\u2019s the catch. Each person\u2019s computer draws a slightly different image, with the variances being almost imperceptible differences in the font, graphics, or even the number of pixels. Then, that image can be used to give each user\u2019s device a unique identity.\n\nThe fingerprinting can virtually happen in the blink of an eye. \u201cThis is another method of attempting to identify users uniquely,\u201d said Steven Englehardt, a PhD student in Princeton University\u2019s Department of Computer Science and one of the report\u2019s researchers.\n\nRelated: Snowden and NSA: A Boon to the Privacy Business\n\nThose pieces of information are adding up. The report found this occurring on more than 5.5 percent of the most popular 100,000 websites today. Websites that run canvas-fingerprinting scripts on their homepages include well-known sites such as whitehouse.gov, nydailynews.com, Hilton.com, the blaze.com, cbslocal.com, twitpic.com, perezhilton.com, and starbucks.com. For each, a company called AddThis, which offers tools most of use on websites, including share buttons for social networks, was uncovered as the fingerprinting domain.\n\nIn fact, the vast majority of canvas fingerprinting scripts\u2014nearly 95 percent\u2014was traced back to AddThis. As it turns out, the undetected tracking mechanism is often embedded in 'share' buttons on sites that use social media sharing tools.\n\nPro Publica\u2019s investigation found users essentially develop profiles overtime based on the sites they visit. And from these profiles, ads and various content can target them directly.\n\nRelated: In a Fickle Shift, Tech Titans Embrace the GOP\n\n\u201cBrowser fingerprinting is being used in the hopes that even through cookies clearing, companies will still be able to identify users,\u201d said Englehardt. \u201cThe argument the ad industry makes is that it allows them to better tailor their advertisements to users.\u201d\n\nThe detail that sets canvas fingerprinting apart? It\u2019s remarkably difficult to prevent. By design, it circumvents users\u2019 online tracking preferences. Simply changing your computers privacy settings doesn\u2019t make a difference.\n\nEnter Privacy Badger, a tool from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which released anti-tracking blocker yesterday. Privacy Badger is an add-on for Chrome and Firefox, which the EFF says \u201cblocks spying ads and invisible trackers.\u201d They claim it\u2019s an \u201canswer to intrusive and objectionable practices in the online advertising industry, and many advertisers\u2019 outright refusal to meaningfully honor Do Not Track requests.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new study finds that an undetected tracking mechanism known as \u201ccanvas fingerprinting\u201d is often embedded in 'share' buttons.", "title": "The Secret Fingerprint That\u2019s Following Your Every Click", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/24/Secret-Fingerprint-s-Following-Your-Every-Click", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/02162013_Startup_Industries_Security_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/07/24/Secret-Fingerprint-s-Following-Your-Every-Click", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/02162013_Startup_Industries_Security_slideshow.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "A new study finds that an undetected tracking mechanism known as \u201ccanvas fingerprinting\u201d is often embedded in 'share' buttons.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "By design, it circumvents users\u2019 online tracking preferences.\nIn fact, the vast majority of canvas fingerprinting scripts\u2014nearly 95 percent\u2014was traced back to AddThis.\n\u201cThe argument the ad industry makes is that it allows them to better tailor their advertisements to users.\u201dThe detail that sets canvas fingerprinting apart?\nThe newly developed form of user tracking, called \u201ccanvas fingerprinting,\u201d works like this: You click on a website and your web browser is automatically told to draw an image.\nTwo years ago, the father of a teenage girl turned on the computer he shared with his daughter."}
