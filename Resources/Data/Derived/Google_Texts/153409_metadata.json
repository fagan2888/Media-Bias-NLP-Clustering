A good crisis is what\u2019s needed to stir the blood and change the tableau, whether political or economic.\n\nOn Tuesday, voters handed Republicans in the state Capitol a thick, downy security blanket. They gained no seats in the House or Senate, but the margins of victory were definitive. The GOP hold on power in both chambers may be unassailable well beyond 2020.\n\nThe question is what Republicans will do when confronted with the luxury of unshakable authority. The temptation is to say that the past 12 years have been prelude \u2014 management at the margins of crises, punctuated by loud feuds over social issues.\n\nBut Gov. Nathan Deal, handed a second term on Tuesday, has targeted the state funding formula for Georgia\u2019s 180 school systems \u2014 an explosive and core issue, to say the least.\n\nAnd now leaders in both the House and Senate have dropped broad hints that they\u2019re willing to consider what many Republicans viewed as unthinkable only a few years ago: an increase in the state\u2019s gasoline tax to produce the billions of dollars needed to address Georgia\u2019s woefully underfunded system of roads and bridges.\n\nThe increase would come by an act of the Legislature. There would be no repeat of the messy multiregion referendums that were attempted with the transportation sales tax vote in 2013 \u2014 which failed in all but a few areas of the state.\n\nSupporters of the venture were encouraged by Tuesday\u2019s vote \u2014 with a 53 percent margin \u2014 to renew a special option local sales tax in Cobb County, a heavily Republican enclave. And by the overwhelming, 63 percent approval of a $200 million transportation bond referendum in Forsyth County, which is arguably the most Republican county in all of Georgia.\n\nThe call for an increase in the gasoline tax would come in December or early January through a legislative/civic animal called the Joint Study Committee on Critical Transportation Infrastructure Funding, which has been holding meetings across the state since July. Call it the Plan B Committee.\n\nIn a debate shortly before last week\u2019s election, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle was asked what he expected from the body. \u201cThis committee is going to come back with significant recommendations,\u201d Cagle said. \u201cAnd it does need to be big, and it needs to be bold.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re told that Cagle repeated those words this week at a Georgia Chamber of Commerce meeting.\n\nOn Friday, in answer to our inquiry, House Speaker David Ralston sent the following message via email: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to deal with our transportation inadequacies and that means funding. Whatever form that takes, we have to reach a consensus and have the resolve to see it through.\u201d\n\nThe green lights have been flashed. So what qualifies as big and bold when it comes to transportation in Georgia?\n\nAlready under consideration is legislation to allow two, three or more counties to band together and levy sales taxes for road and transit purposes. But that\u2019s small stuff.\n\nThe state now levies a 4 percent tax on gasoline, but one of those pennies goes into the general fund. Recapturing it would put an additional $180 million or so into transportation. Again, that\u2019s small change.\n\nState-funded commuter rail and other forms of public transit would fall into the category of \u201ctoo big.\u201d This is despite last week\u2019s 73 percent approval by Clayton County voters to invite MARTA into their midst. For too many Republicans, public transit is simply another form of public assistance.\n\nWhich brings us to the gasoline tax \u2014 or as Republicans are likely to reframe it, the gasoline user fee. The problem is that, as cars and trucks become more energy-efficient, they use less gasoline but the same amount of roadway.\n\n\u201dWhen I got a new SUV two years ago, I doubled my gas mileage. My motor fuel tax went down. It didn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t wear and tear the road any less. I tell people that their taxes have typically been going down,\u201d said state Rep. Mark Hamilton, R-Cumming, a member of the Plan B Committee. \u201cIf a person buys all their gasoline in Georgia, and they drive 12,000 miles a year and they get 24 miles to the gallon, they pay about $85 for the entire year for the entire road-and-bridge network. Most people pay $100 a month for the cellphone.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the growing number of electric cars on the road. The state offers tax breaks to encourage their purchase. \u201cThey then turn around and pay zero tax for the roads that they utilize,\u201d Hamilton said.\n\nThe size of a gasoline tax increase would have to be significant to matter, and indexed to inflation so that as prices rise, tax revenue would increase, too.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying this is the number, but there\u2019s a lot of people saying the DOT could easily justify needing, for their road structure, anywhere from $700 million to $1.5 billion a year to fix the problem that we have now,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cAre we going to be able to get that big a bite at the apple? I\u2019m not sure, but I\u2019m going to do everything in my power as a legislator to make sure that we don\u2019t kick this can down the road, that we don\u2019t play a shell game of just moving money around.\u201d\n\nHamilton wants something on the governor\u2019s desk by the time lawmakers leave Atlanta next spring.\n\nEdward Lindsey, a former state House member who ran an unsuccessful campaign for Congress this year, is also a member of the Plan B Committee. Lethargy, he said, will not do.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re now through two election cycles in which we have bullet-proof majorities in the House and Senate. We are safe in our majorities for a few years down the road. Now we just have to govern,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cTransportation is a critical aspect of our needs, and we\u2019re going to be blamed for it. We own it, and if we don\u2019t fix it, we\u2019re in trouble in the long run. We can\u2019t point the blame at (President Barack) Obama or anybody else anymore. This is all ours now.\u201d\n\nOne green light that has not yet flashed is located in the governor\u2019s office. Lindsey is confident of gaining his eventual support. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve observed about Deal \u2013 Deal likes to fix things,\u201d Lindsey said. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to take the point on fixing things.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2014/11/08/state-lawmakers-willing-to-consider-increase-in-state-gasoline-tax/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/25a01-traffic-war_238_220085.jpg?w=640", "type": "article", "description": "The problem with security, any Social Darwinist will tell you, is that it often breeds lethargy.
