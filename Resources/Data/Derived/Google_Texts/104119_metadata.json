The system is designed to be simple and entail no investment costs to participants.\n\nBut it comes with a very big string attached: All contributions will be invested in a special government account that pays the same variable nominal return (not inflation indexed) as the Government Securities Investment Fund in the Thrift Savings Plan for federal employees. In other words, the assets placed in myRA accounts will neither be diversified nor protected against inflation.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: 6 Reasons myRAs Won\u2019t Ease the Retirement Crisis\n\nWith the Federal Reserve printing money at what one might view as an astronomical rate, there is good reason to worry that inflation will produce negative real myRA account returns.\n\nThe president\u2019s initiative also raises some questions about the making of fiscal policy. Although the myRA accounts will likely have a negligible impact on federal revenues, they will have some impact. Isn\u2019t Congress supposed to legislate all matters fiscal?\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not clear that the myRA accounts will actually be invested in government securities. If they\u2019re not, they may end up as a form of borrowing by the government that\u2019s off the books. Finally, the myRA accounts permit tax-free withdrawal of contributions at any time. This is better treatment than regular Roth IRAs receive \u2013 so the myRA is not simply the extension of an existing policy.\n\nAll these quibbles aside, we applaud the president\u2019s concern with Americans\u2019 failure to save. Clearly we face a national saving crisis. Last year, our nation saved only 2 percent of its net national income. In 1950, the national savings rate was 15 percent.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s New myRA: What You Need to Know\n\nOur six-decade decline in our savings rate has produced economic fallout. Since we aren\u2019t saving, we don\u2019t have the wherewithal to invest. Last year\u2019s net domestic investment rate was 4 percent, far below the 1950 rate, which was also 15 percent. The difference between our saving and investment rates reflects foreign investment in the U.S.\n\nBut this foreign investment, which is measured as our nation\u2019s current account deficit, hasn\u2019t been large enough to keep our investment rate from falling, over time, by almost three quarters. Less domestic investment has meant less real wage growth.\n\nApart from fringe benefits, American workers now earn no more, in real terms, than they did in the imd-60s. Clearly there are many interconnected factors at play here including foreign competition, offshoring, growing wage inequality, and competition with smart machines. Nonetheless, real wages would surely be higher had we spent the last 60 years investing 15 percent of national income year in and year out.\n\nWhat explains the decline in national saving? Is it the government sector that\u2019s consuming a much larger share of national income? No. Of the 13 percentage-points decline in the national saving rate, only 1 percentage point can be attributable to government. The rest \u2013 92 percent \u2013 reflects an increase in household consumption as a share of national income.\n\nSo who within the household sector is consuming so much more? The answer is not undisciplined younger generations, but rather the elderly. Over the decades, consumption by the elderly has grown dramatically relative to that of younger people. For example, in the early sixties, 80-year-olds consumed, on average, about two thirds of what 30 year-olds consumed.\n\nRelated: The 5-Decade Plan for a Successful Retirement\n\nToday, they consume over 50 percent more. The explanation lies in a massive intergenerational redistribution from the young, no matter how poor, to the old, no matter how rich, that has been effected over time through the expansion of Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, as well as via tax cuts that differentially helped the elderly.\n\nThe retirement account system hasn\u2019t overcome the impact of this policy on national saving, nor, given its design, could one have expected it to. True, some workers have had better incentives to save. But the reductions in lifetime taxes and associated increases in disposable lifetime incomes from the plethora of 401(k), 403(b), IRA, SEPs, Keogh Accounts, Roth IRAs \u2026 and now, myRAs, have done more to encourage consumption than saving.\n\nThey\u2019ve enriched the mutual fund industry, but baby boomers as a group are reaching retirement with far too little overall savings. Many will be wholly or mostly dependent on Social Security, which is 32 percent underfinanced, according to Table IVB6 of its 2013 Trustees Report.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nThe answer is to think big. We recommend replacing, in its entirety, our employer-based retirement account system with Personal Security Accounts or PSAs. Under this plan, all single workers would contribute 8 percent of their pay to their PSAs. Married workers\u2019 contributions would be allocated 50-50 to their own and their spouses\u2019 PSAs.\n\nRelated: Retiring This Year?

All contributions would be invested by a computer, not Wall Street, at zero cost to account holders in a global index fund consisting of stocks, corporate bonds, government bonds, and real estate investment trusts. The government would guarantee a zero real return on the global index.\n\nAt age 60, the same computer would begin gradually selling off each worker\u2019s holdings of the global index, with all holdings sold by age 70. The proceeds from each month\u2019s sale would be spent on Treasury Inflation Protected bonds. The principal and interest from those bonds would in turn be used by the computer to provide inflation-indexed annuities to workers, where the annuity pool would be formed by the individual\u2019s age cohort.\n\nThese annuities would be adjusted annually based on the cohort\u2019s projected longevity to ensure that no costs are passed to younger generations.\n\nPersonal Security Accounts could gradually replace the retirement portion of Social Security. Alternatively, they could supplement Social Security. Those on the left could view PSAs as a modern form of compulsory saving, while those on the right could label it privatization of Social Security, since the new system would have individual accounts, hold private assets, and trade in global financial markets. So both sides could claim victory \u2013 a sine qua non for policy progress.\n\nOur country is in a deep hole. No matter where one looks \u2013 at the tax system, at Social Security, at health care, at retirement saving \u2013 one sees terrible design crying out for simple, efficient, and low-cost radical reforms. Using Personal Security Accounts to supplement or reform Social Security would help ensure the next generation a secure retirement \u2013 something most baby boomers now desperately covet.\n\nLaurence Kotlikoff is Warren Professor of Economics, Boston University, and Director of the Tax Analysis Center.
