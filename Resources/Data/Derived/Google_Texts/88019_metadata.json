It's a fresh start for kids and Galesburg schools.\n\n\"It was tough,\" McNally recalled.\n\nA strike divides a community and strains relationships. But this August, there's a revival of energy and enthusiasm.\n\n\"This is what it's supposed to be when you become a teacher,\" she said. \"You think of these faces.\"\n\nMoms like Brandi Bridgewater feel the spirit.\n\n\"The kids are really excited,\" she said.\n\n\"We came out of a really bad situation,\" McNally concluded. \"And I think we're stronger for it.\"\n\nThey'll be staying Nielson Strong for 2015 and years to come.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "40.947816;-90.371240", "description": "Galesburg teachers roll out the red carpet for students at Nielson School on Thursday.
