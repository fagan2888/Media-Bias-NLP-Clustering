Notably, new regulations and presidential announcements over the last several months with respect to the ACA have imposed operational changes well after product and pricing decisions had been finalized,\u201d Zaharuk\u2019s note said.\n\nHe adds net margins could be reduced to 2% from an average of roughly 3% and smaller membership growth for insurers.\n\nFurther, uncertainty created by private exchanges could disrupt the employer group market, and stagnant employment could limit growth, the note said.\n\n\u201cWe continue to expect that these dynamics will have an uneven effect on insurers, as the impact of these factors will vary by market segment and geography. Our view continues to be that the larger and more diversified insurers will be better positioned, both financially and strategically, to meet the challenges facing the sector,\u201d Zaharuk said.\n\nMajor insurers were mixed in early trading, with UnitedHealth Group Inc. /quotes/zigman/258846/delayed /quotes/nls/unh UNH and WellPoint Inc. /quotes/zigman/362231/delayed /quotes/nls/wlp WLP up marginally.
