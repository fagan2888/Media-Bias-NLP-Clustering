Washington (CNN) Ohio Gov. John Kasich joked that he gets Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul "confused" with his libertarian father, former Rep. Ron Paul, and defended his conservative credentials against critiques of his move to expand Medicaid in his state.

Asked by CNN's Gloria Borger about Paul's comments that governors who expanded Medicaid under Obamacare think that "money grows on trees," Kasich replied, "You mean Senator Ron Paul?"

When Borger insisted she meant the younger Paul, Kasich joked that they were hard to tell apart.

"Oh, I get them confused sometimes," he said, laughing. "Ron and Rand, and I served with Ron."

Pressed by Borger on how he would respond to Paul's critique, Kasich said he had little to say to the senator. He suggested maybe Kentucky's residents weren't dealing with poverty or hunger the way those in other states are.
