Ben Sasse, the freshman Republican who has pledged not to vote for Donald Trump for president even if the brash millionaire earns the GOP\u2019s nomination, appeared at the Conservative Political Action Conference today and urged the crowd to put conservative principles before allegiance to the Republican Party.\n\nWithout ever mentioning Trump by name, Sasse said that the country is in a time of \u201cConstitutional crisis\u201d in which voters need to look to the good of the country and the preservation of a limited government for future generations.\n\nRelated: Dump Trump and Lose Voters \u2013 Is That Really the GOP Plan?\n\n\u201cThe top concern of all Americans should always be that the American ideal is held first and foremost,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want you to be a conservative and a Republican,\u201d he said. However, he added, \u201cThose things must be listed second to being an American. Conservatism is a set of policy principles and policy preferences. Republicanism is about an organization. It\u2019s about a political party. I love both of these things\u2026but you have to rank your Americanism first, and then your conservatism second, and only your Republicanism third, because your Conservatism is a set of policy preferences, and they matter.\u201d\n\nComing from a man who had publicly promised to break with his party and cast his own vote for a \u201cconstitutionalist\u201d if Trump is nominated, it wasn\u2019t hard to grasp what Sasse was suggesting: that true conservatives should shun Trump even if he gains the imprimatur of the Party.\n\nClaiming he was \u201cnot here to talk about any of the presidential candidates,\u201d Sasse nonetheless said he hoped attendees would look for a candidate that would help future generations understand what he called the \u201cAmerican idea\u201d and that believe in limited government, equality under the law, and inclusiveness.\n\nRelated: Get Ready for a Two-Hour Food Fight at Tonight\u2019s GOP Debate\n\n\u201cSomeone you would want to sit at the dinner table with your children,\u201d he said. \u201cDo you hear a champion not of tearing more things down, but of building American back up? Because I am anti-establishment, but what we need most of all is not just someone who wants to breathe fire on Washington, but someone who will breathe passion into our children for a Constitutional recovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause, he said, ending on Trump\u2019s own tagline, \u201cthat\u2019s how we will actually make America great again.\u201d\n\nBut outside the convention hall, it was clear that for voters in the Republican primaries, things are not quite so cut and dried. Paul Sutliff, a teacher from Rochester, New York described himself as a conservative with strong concerns about national security. He said he has been frustrated in the past by what he described as the efforts of the party elites to let a \u201creal conservative\u201d get the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nHis candidate? Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAs far as national security, our best candidate at this point is Trump,\u201d Sutliff said. \u201cI\u2019m not an avid Trump supporter. I don\u2019t consider him a conservative. Government\u2019s first job is to protect its people. He\u2019s not a conservative at all, but on national security at this point, he\u2019s the only one who understands the game.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Republicans taking a stand against Donald Trump are begging GOP voters to consider themselves conservatives first and Republicans second.
