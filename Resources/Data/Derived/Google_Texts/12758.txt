A plan to build a new football stadium in Carson, CA came one step closer to reality this week after the Los Angeles registrar certified that the measure had the signatures needed to qualify for a spot on the ballot.

Carson city council members will meet on Tuesday to decide whether to approve the ballot initiative for a public vote or bypass the process altogether and adopt the plan outright.

In February, the Inglewood city council adopted a plan to build an NFL stadium at the old Hollywood Park site. St. Louis Ram’s owner Stan Kroenke has said that he will privately fund the construction of the proposed stadium so he can move the Rams back to Los Angeles.

The San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders are hoping a competing stadium plan in nearby Carson will be an alternative home if they cannot work out favorable deals in their hometowns. While details about the financing have yet to be released, the plan is reported to be similar to the San Francisco 49’er’s stadium deal in Santa Clara, CA which required over $600 million in construction loans from the city.

Reason TV recently sat down with Chapman University’s Joel Kotkin to talk about why giving public cash for stadium projects is a really bad idea. Produced by Alexis Garcia. Approximately 5 minutes. Original release date was March 17, 2015 and the original writeup is below.
