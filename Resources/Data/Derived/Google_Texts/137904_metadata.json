So, more than four years in, what do they appear to have learned? How about: nothing. And they seem to want it that way.\n\nCertainly that appears to be the case with the Tea Party as an electoral force. Oh, Tea Partyers will remind you \u2013 they\u2019ve won some. Ted Cruz in Texas, Mike Lee in Utah, Ron Johnson in Wisconsin \u2013 all True Conservatives in good standing (at least last I looked; these things can change rapidly), all solid winners in their election bids. It\u2019s hardly the case that nominating a Tea Party candidate is guaranteed to turn a win into a loss.\n\nBut three election cycles in, it\u2019s pretty clear that nominating a candidate favored by Tea Partyers over what they consider \u201cestablishment\u201d candidates is a formula for risking Republican disaster. And that it\u2019s not going to change any time soon.\n\nSo it was for Christine O\u2019Donnell and Sharron Angle in 2010. So it was with Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock in 2012. And so it\u2019s likely to be with the 2014 crop.\n\nThe thing is, four years is plenty of time to develop solid, seasoned candidates. Indeed, once upon a time Marco Rubio was one of those solid, seasoned candidates. Rubio was a successful Florida Republican who had risen rapidly to become speaker of the Florida House; he then adopted the emerging Tea Party and went on to easily win an open U.S. Senate seat. But Rubio\u2019s Tea Party credentials were tarnished because he actually tried to legislate on immigration; while it\u2019s much too early to declare his career in trouble and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if he still ran a solid race for the Republican presidential nomination, it\u2019s also very easy to imagine him having to fend off a Tea Party primary of his own if he runs for reelection instead of the White House in 2016.\n\nSo what do Republicans have for 2014? Matt Bevin, taking on Mitch McConnell in Kentucky, is a first-time candidate; should he win, Republicans would probably lose that seat. In Georgia, Paul Braun in particular is thought by many to be a particularly weak candidate, capable of losing that open seat to Democrat Michelle Nunn if he emerges as the nominee. In Louisiana, Republicans had settled on a solid candidate to challenge Mary Landrieu, but Tea Partyer Rob Maness has jumped in with plenty of serious organizational support.\n\nGranted, this early in the cycle, none of these candidates has (to my knowledge, at least) managed to embarrass himself by orating on rape. Nor have any of them yet revealed themselves as certified non-witches. Indeed, it\u2019s so early that I don\u2019t even know if they have a history of having said crazy things \u2013 although I suspect that Mississippi Tea Party candidate Chris McDaniel, a former talk radio host, has furnished enough for a fat opposition research file.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After a few election cycles, they\u2019re no longer a new entity.
