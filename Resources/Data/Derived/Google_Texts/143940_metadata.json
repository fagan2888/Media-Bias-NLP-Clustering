Goetz rejected it for a host of reasons, saying he felt coerced into taking the money from the undercover officer and that police are too aggressive nowadays.\n\nPHOTOS: The famous \u2014 and infamous \u2014 vigilantes in U.S. history\n\n\u201cIf they want to get a conviction on me as a marijuana seller, they can take it to a jury and let a jury decide,\u201d he said, calling the case \u201cbaloney\u201d that he believed prosecutors wouldn\u2019t want to bring to trial.\n\nHis lawyer, Danielle Iredale, had asked a judge to dismiss the case for lack of a speedy trial. Under New York law, his type of misdemeanor case can be tossed out if prosecutors aren\u2019t ready for trial within 90 days after the case starts. But the rules surrounding allowable delays are complicated and often disputed between prosecutors and defense lawyers.\n\nOn Wednesday, Judge Laurie Peterson concluded that prosecutors missed the window by 14 days.\n\nThe district attorney\u2019s office had no comment. A message left with Goetz wasn\u2019t immediately returned.\n\nGoetz, 65, said he repeatedly offered simply to give the pot to a woman he didn\u2019t realize was an undercover officer, but she insisted on paying. Then, another officer plainclothes approached and \u201ctried to get me to punch him,\u201d speaking aggressively and coming within two feet of him before backing off, Goetz said, adding that he hadn\u2019t initially realized the man was an officer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very anti-crime \u2014 everybody knows that. This is just a waste of government resources,\u201d he said after an April court date, arguing that prosecutors in general shouldn\u2019t pursue low-level marijuana cases.\n\nIn 1984, Goetz was branded the \u201csubway vigilante\u201d when he shot four black teens with an illegal handgun on a No. 2 train in Manhattan. At least one had a screwdriver, and they were asking him for $5. Goetz said it was self-defense and the youths intended to mug him. One of the teens was paralyzed.\n\nThe shooting brought to the surface long-smoldering urban issues of race, crime and quality of life. It also thrust Goetz, a white self-employed electronics expert, into the role of spokesman for what some considered a justified form of vigilantism.\n\nGoetz was cleared of attempted murder charges and spent 250 days in jail in 1987 for a weapons conviction in the case.\n\nReturning to the headlines didn\u2019t seem to bother Goetz. Speaking with reporters after his various court dates, the onetime mayoral candidate aired his views on instant runoff voting, vegetarianism, an ongoing debate over the future of the city\u2019s carriage horses, and the policing of New York today, compared to the high-crime era when he first became a household name.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A low-level marijuana case against 1980s subway shooter Bernie Goetz has been dismissed after a judge concluded the clock ran out for trying it.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A low-level marijuana case against 1980s subway shooter Bernie Goetz has been dismissed after a judge concluded the clock ran out for trying it.", "title": "Marijuana case vs. Bernie Goetz dismissed", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/sep/10/apnewsbreak-bernie-goetz-marijuana-case-dismissed/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/10/69aac3eba3c74f235f0f6a706700c5c6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/10/69aac3eba3c74f235f0f6a706700c5c6.jpg", "description": "A low-level marijuana case against 1980s subway shooter Bernie Goetz has been dismissed after a judge concluded the clock ran out for trying it.", "card": "summary", "title": "Marijuana case vs. Bernie Goetz dismissed"}, "Author": "Colleen Long, Jennifer Peltz", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Bernie Goetz, New York"}, "article_summary": "NEW YORK \u2014 A low-level marijuana case against 1980s subway shooter Bernie Goetz has been dismissed after a judge concluded the clock ran out for trying it.\nGoetz was busted in December on charges he sold $30 worth of marijuana to an undercover officer he\u2019d been flirting with in Union Square park.\nGoetz rejected it for a host of reasons, saying he felt coerced into taking the money from the undercover officer and that police are too aggressive nowadays.\nGoetz was cleared of attempted murder charges and spent 250 days in jail in 1987 for a weapons conviction in the case.\nUnder New York law, his type of misdemeanor case can be tossed out if prosecutors aren\u2019t ready for trial within 90 days after the case starts."}
