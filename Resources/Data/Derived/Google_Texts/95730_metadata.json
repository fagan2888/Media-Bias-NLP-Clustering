That\u2019s quite an achievement \u2013 and he\u2019s only just getting started.\n\nSo why the sudden, rather drastic career change? Jimmy explains that both he and his parents assumed he was destined for a career in engineering, primarily because he spent most of his early childhood in New Zealand engrossed with Lego and K\u2019NEX. But it was only after graduating from uni and spending time in his first job that he realised he was on the wrong path. He began reading autobiographies of successful people, Richard Branson\u2019s was his biggest motivator \u2013 and looking at his senior colleagues, questioned if he wanted to be where they are in 20 or 30 years\u2019 time.\n\n\u201cI realised after a while that what I was actually passionate about was creating something big from scratch; something that I was in complete control of; something that could help someone else\u2019s dreams while helping me actualise my own dreams.\n\n\u201cSo I followed by gut instinct, and decided to grow MyTuition.\u201d\n\nIt was an idea that originated during his first year at university. \u201cI\u2019d just spent five years at Macleans College learning how to survive in the high school environment with all its exams and tests \u2013 and then at uni I discovered that none of it was really applicable anymore.\u201d\n\nJimmy thought it would be a good idea to set up a way to go back to high school to tutor students on not only how to be good at maths, English, science or any other subject, but provide another perspective on studying and life beyond school. From people who\u2019d \u2018been there done that\u2019.\n\nThe concept was trialled at Macleans and well received. It wasn\u2019t until after Jimmy had graduated that he decided to develop it further with school friend Roy Lin.\n\nUnderstandably his parents thought he was crazy throwing away a perfectly good engineering career, but all Jimmy saw was a \u201cnatural sequence of events\u201d that had taken him to his dream. Jimmy and Roy, who has a degree in software engineering, went full-time, officially launching MyTuition in November 2013.\n\n\u201cInitially our goal was simply to actualise our concept,\u201d admits Jimmy, \u201cand so we did things first and thought about it afterwards.\u201d Nevertheless, growth has been impressive; MyTuition has been operating for two and a half years and each year student and tutor numbers have tripled.\n\n\u201cWe delivered 5000 hours of lessons to 300 students in 2015 alone,\u201d says Jimmy, \u201cand we\u2019re up to 160 active tutors.\n\n\u201cIn terms of tutoring agencies that actually manage their portfolio, we\u2019re already one of the largest in Auckland.\u201d\n\nTheir point of difference, he explains, is keeping students on track with their studies all year. \u201cWe\u2019ve been in their shoes and know what they\u2019re going through. We provide practical advice.\n\n\u201cIf you pool the collective knowledge of our tutors, then there\u2019s a wealth of personal experiences that can help guide students through whatever they happen to be going through.\u201d\n\nJimmy says MyTuition tutors are mostly fresh out of high school and studying at university. \u201cThey\u2019re all relatable. They know what it\u2019s like to go through high school; they understand the pressures, and teach as an equal to the student. They have their best interests at heart and genuinely want to help them.\u201d\n\nAnother point of difference is the consistent oversight, he says. \u201cThere\u2019re multiple people behind every single student, ensuring that student is doing well. To enable this we built our own online software platform. It allows us to manage the students, track their progress, and automate all the unimportant stuff so we can spend more time with them.\u201d\n\nHe says their focus in 2016 is to continue building an online assisted community for students through Facebook. \u201cWe manage this community, providing advice, resources, articles and information,\u201d says Jimmy. \u201cAnd our tutors are on standby to answer any questions the students can\u2019t answer. It\u2019s all about helping each other; we act as facilitators.\u201d\n\nTutors and challenges\n\nMyTuition is a great first step in the careers of the tutors too, says Jimmy. For tutors, who\u2019re fully screened and must have A\u2019s or Excellences in the subjects they teach, it\u2019s not only satisfying to pass on knowledge, it\u2019s also a foot on the job ladder.\n\nHe says the greatest challenge so far has been managing the high volume of students and tutors while keeping everything affordable and personal. The backend system they developed has been a big help, along with recently hiring four staff for their Queen Street office.\n\nLooking back Jimmy\u2019s only regret is not reaching out to potential mentors earlier. \u201cEven though we\u2019ve been very successful, we could have accomplished even more with guidance. We taught everything ourselves from scratch.\u201d\n\nHe says the big name competition is starting to take notice, so it\u2019s important they now develop their own support network. Business mentor Jan Bierman is already making a difference, he says.\n\nAs for marketing \u2013 creating awareness is all about helping students. They do that through regular exam workshops or information evenings in local libraries. Content marketing, word of mouth and social media takes care of the rest. \u201cWherever students gather, we\u2019ll try and be there,\u201d says Jimmy.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt 2016 is going to be a milestone year for MyTuition. The focus is on expanding the MyTuition community even further and making it easier for students and tutors to share and gain knowledge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about helping the next generation,\u201d he says. \u201cSharing experiences and bridging the gap between different perspectives.\n\n\u201cOur end goal is to become the go-to people in Auckland for tutoring.\u201d\n\nAnd yes, there\u2019s a vision to take the concept to other main centres and across the Tasman.\n\nArticle by Glenn Baker.
