Fauci said he does not currently have the resources needed to fight Zika.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve done is take money from other areas of non-Zika research to start,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t just stop and wait for the money.\u201d\n\nFunding that the agency is currently planning to go toward areas such as malaria and tuberculosis next year are, for now, going towards Zika, he said.\n\nNot having funding could also make it harder for the government to work with pharmaceutical companies to develop a vaccine or diagnostic, Fauci added.\n\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t perceive us as a reliable partner, they tend to back off a bit,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to develop these counter measures on our own.\u201d\n\nWhite House Press Secretary echoed Fauci\u2019s call for Congress to fund the administration\u2019s request, and said he hoped Fauci\u2019s and Schuchat\u2019s appearance at the briefing would help motivate Congress to act on the request.\n\n\u201cWe have not seen the kind of response from Congress that we would expect, and frankly we haven\u2019t been the kind of response from Congress that is clearly in the interest of the safety and wellbeing of the American people,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/icons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "Morning Consult", "description": "The outbreak of Zika virus is worse than originally expected, Obama administration officials that are leading the repose to the outbreak told reporters Monday. \u201cMost of what we\u2019re learning is not reassuring,\u201d Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the\u00a0 Centers for Disease Control, said Monday at the White House press briefing. \u201cEverything we look at... read more", "title": "Zika Virus 'a Little Bit Scarier' Than Expected, Administration Official Says - Morning Consult", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/themes/morning-consult/img/MC_logo_twitter_fb.png", "url": "https://morningconsult.com/alert/zika-virus-little-bit-scarier-expected-administration-official-says/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The outbreak of Zika virus is worse than originally expected, Obama administration officials that are leading the repose to the outbreak told reporters Monday. \u201cMost of what we\u2019re learning is not reassuring,\u201d Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the\u00a0 Centers for Disease Control, said Monday at the White House press briefing. \u201cEverything we look at... read more", "creator": "@melmcintire", "image": "https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/themes/morning-consult/img/MC_logo_twitter_fb.png", "title": "Zika Virus 'a Little Bit Scarier' Than Expected, Administration Official Says - Morning Consult", "site": "@morningconsult", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#2b5797", "msapplication-TileImage": "/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Morning-Consult-183517831660100/", "section": "Health"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9883\"", "article_summary": "The outbreak of Zika virus is worse than originally expected, Obama administration officials that are leading the repose to the outbreak told reporters Monday.\n\u201cEverything we look at with this virus seems to be a little bit scarier than we initially thought,\u201d she added.\nFauci said he does not currently have the resources needed to fight Zika.\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t perceive us as a reliable partner, they tend to back off a bit,\u201d he said.\nLast week, the administration announced it would transfer more than $500 million that had been allocated for Ebola to prepare for Zika, but maintained that money needed to be replaced, and that more was still needed for Zika."}
