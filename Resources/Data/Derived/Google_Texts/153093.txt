Another insurer is reporting significant revenue losses on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchanges.

Highmark Health recently reported a loss of $438 million, which includes a loss on the government business—Medicare, Medicaid and the ACA—of $655 million and a gain on the commercial business of $217 million.

Highmark’s ACA enrollment is down more than 40%, from about 350,000 to under about 200,000.

“These losses are unsustainable for anyone,” Karen Hanlon, executive vice president and chief financial officer, Highmark Health, tells Managed Healthcare Executive. “Ensuring that the ACA market is viable for the future is a goal for Highmark Health and a responsibility that should be shared by the entire healthcare community. We cannot regress and put the health of 12.7 million people at risk.

“It is essential we get the right premium rates, the right care delivery networks, and the right care management programs in place to stabilize the market so that it can sustain itself,” Hanlon says.

Other insurers face same struggle

“We’ve seen this from other insurers stating that they have lost money on the exchange business,” says Managed Healthcare Executive Editorial Advisor Joel Brill, MD, chief medical office at Predictive Health. “Some are dropping out, others are tightening their belts and staying in.”
