SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Zoo officials in Salt Lake City held a baby shower Saturday for a big-eyed, spikey-haired little boy named Tuah.

A handful of animal keepers at Hogle Zoo found themselves with a tiny red-headed charge when the zoo’s female Bornean orangutan, Eve, died a few weeks after giving birth.

Now 5 months old, the 14-inch, 11-pound baby Tuah is just starting to crawl.

Zoo spokeswoman Erica Hansen says visitors lined up around the ape building on Saturday to catch their first glimpse of Tuah.

Bobbi Gordon says the primate handlers who provided around-the-clock care for the infant “lived like an orangutan.”

Orangutans spend most of their time in trees, so an infant orangutan’s instinct is to cling to his mother’s fur while she builds nests and scavenges for food. So Tuah couldn’t be put in a crib like a human baby. He needed to constantly hang onto someone, even while sleeping.
