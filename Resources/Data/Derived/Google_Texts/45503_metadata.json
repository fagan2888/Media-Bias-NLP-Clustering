As head of an organization claiming to be the expert on all things related to women\u2019s health, she could not revert to the standard copout answer, \u201cIt\u2019s above my pay grade.\u201d Nor could she admit that life begins at some point in the womb, lest she complicate Planned Parenthood\u2019s financial decision to offer abortion up until birth.\n\nInstead, Ms. Cecile admitted a truth that the abortion industry strains to conceal: For them, when life begins doesn\u2019t matter. Ms. Cecile\u2019s exact words: \u201cI don\u2019t know that it\u2019s really relevant to the, relevant to the conversation.\u201d\n\nIt is certainly relevant to many Americans, some embroiled in lawsuits pending before the Supreme Court. Through Obamacare mandates, they are forced to subsidize life-ending drugs and devices, and sometimes abortions themselves, in pursuit of a federal policy that steamrolls personal objections to ending life. In this instance, the question of when life begins is at the heart and soul of the objections of many to the anti-life mandates in the health care law.\n\nBut in her answer, Ms. Cecile reveals Big Abortions\u2019 callous disinterest in the science of unborn life and growth, and her contempt for those who do believe life counts. Instead, she reinforces a politically correct take on situational ethics \u2014 that whether an unborn child should continue living should be arbitrarily left in the hands of another. To reinforce her position, she went on to state that she did not consider her own three children \u201calive\u201d until after she delivered them at birth.\n\nIt would seem that in Ms. Cecile\u2019s definition of life, the scientific view \u2014 that life can be observed in response to stimuli or by growth, for example \u2014 is discarded, replaced by an implausible position that life is defined by location. She seems to assert that people\u2019s humanity is not their own, but rather a construct of the people around them.\n\nMs. Cecile\u2019s view is at odds with those of every mother who sees her child in an ultrasound, a seminal event and one of many quandaries for abortion advocates as science exposes the faulty reasoning in Roe v. Wade. It is indisputable that at conception a zygote, with unique human DNA, forms and begins to grow, within weeks taking on all the characteristics attributable to fully formed humans.\n\nThat Ms. Cecile and other abortion-industry champions have fought so hard against laws that would protect children who are five-months along, moving and experiencing life in their mothers\u2019 wombs, shows a breathtaking disregard of the obvious unique humanity of a young human being.\n\nAlarmingly, America\u2019s own pro-abortion policies support such an extreme position. In fact, the United States remains only one in four nations that allow abortion through all nine months of pregnancy, for any reason and sometimes with taxpayer subsidies. Only Canada, China and North Korea share this distinction. Under Ms. Cecile\u2019s watch, Planned Parenthood ended the lives of 327,166 unborn children through abortion from Oct. 1, 2011, to Sept. 30, 2012, the last year covered under Planned Parenthood\u2019s latest annual report.\n\nThat one person can arbitrarily decide the fate of another without due process smacks of the antiquated and radical ideologies of the pro-slavery lobby that conspired to profit off human misery, and is certainly contrary to American principles of equality, justice and opportunity.\n\nThe good news is that pro-life Americans are gaining ground. As just one example, more pro-life laws have been enacted in the past three years than in the entire previous decade. As early election events unfold, it is clear that a backlash is building against politicians who forced the anti-life policies of Obamacare on the nation.\n\nAbortion ends life; life exists in the womb; women suffer at the hands of abortion industry profiteers; and anti-life Obamacare mandates violate the First Amendment conscience rights of many Americans. These are relevant topics, with political consequences. Regardless of Ms. Cecile\u2019s extreme stance, issues involving life will remain relevant as we respond to our own personal beliefs about life at the ballot box.\n\nJeanneane Maxon is vice president of external affairs at Americans United for Life.", "article_metadata": {"description": "George Washington once wrote, \"Truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains to bring it to light.\" Pain is what it takes these days to get a straight answer out of political figures encased behind walls erected by media and public-relations professionals.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "George Washington once wrote, \u201cTruth will ultimately prevail where there is pains to bring it to light.\u201d Pain is what it takes these days to get a straight answer out of political figures encased behind walls erected by media and public-relations professionals.", "title": "MAXON: For the abortion industry, the question of when life begins doesn\u2019t matter", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/21/maxon-no-copping-out-on-the-life-question/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/14/screen-shot-2014-02-14-at-22725-pm.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/02/14/screen-shot-2014-02-14-at-22725-pm.jpg", "description": "George Washington once wrote, \"Truth will ultimately prevail where there is pains to bring it to light.\" Pain is what it takes these days to get a straight answer out of political figures encased behi", "card": "summary", "title": "MAXON: For the abortion industry, the question of when life begins doe"}, "Author": "Jeanneane Maxon", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Cecile Richards"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfd56\"", "article_summary": "Instead, Ms. Cecile admitted a truth that the abortion industry strains to conceal: For them, when life begins doesn\u2019t matter.\nAbortion ends life; life exists in the womb; women suffer at the hands of abortion industry profiteers; and anti-life Obamacare mandates violate the First Amendment conscience rights of many Americans.\nIn this instance, the question of when life begins is at the heart and soul of the objections of many to the anti-life mandates in the health care law.\nBut in her answer, Ms. Cecile reveals Big Abortions\u2019 callous disinterest in the science of unborn life and growth, and her contempt for those who do believe life counts.\nRegardless of Ms. Cecile\u2019s extreme stance, issues involving life will remain relevant as we respond to our own personal beliefs about life at the ballot box."}
