Deere & Co. and the United Auto Workers have started negotiations on a new master labor agreement that covers about 10,000 manufacturing workers at 12 facilities, including plants in five Iowa cities.

The Moline, Ill.,-based farm and construction equipment manufacturer said Tuesday the current six-year master agreement expires at midnight Sept. 30.

In Iowa, the contract covers factory workers at the Davenport Works, Des Moines Works, Dubuque Works, Ottumwa Works and Waterloo Works, as well as three other plants in Waterloo â€” its tractor and cab assembly, engine works and foundry. The Illinois plants include the Harvester Works in East Moline.

Deere said it has agreed with the UAW to make no further public comment during negotiations except through news releases distributed by the two organizations.

The negotiations begin as Deere has struggled with falling profits.

On Friday, Deere lowered its net income forecast for the year to $1.8 billion from $1.9 billion to reflect soft agricultural spending and a weak energy sector that has curtailed equipment purchases. Agriculture and turf sales in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to drop 25 percent in 2015, with the biggest decline coming from higher-horsepower models.

For the third quarter, Deere posted a profit of $512 million, or $1.53 a share, down from $851 million, or $2.33 a share, a year earlier. Total revenue for the quarter ended July 31 declined 20 percent to $7.59 billion.
