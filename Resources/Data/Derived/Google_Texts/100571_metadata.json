During some election cycles, however, other issues play an outsized role in determining the balance of power in Washington.\n\nIn 2006, voters\u2019 misgivings about the U.S. military occupation in Iraq set the tone for the election and enabled Democrats to take control of Congress. Four years later, backlash against the passage of the Affordable Care Act helped Republicans retake the House and pick up Senate seats.\n\nNo one issue has achieved national prominence this year, but it\u2019s clear that the border crisis has millions of Americans thinking about immigration. According to a recent Gallup survey, it is now one of the top political issues for voters, second only to dissatisfaction with government.\n\nWhile the debate about immigration policy may not produce an electoral wave in the same way Iraq or Obamacare did, it is already affecting several marquee elections throughout the country.\n\nHere\u2019s a sampling of races in which immigration remains a potentially pivotal issue:\n\nColorado Senate\n\n\n\nA year ago, Sen. Mark Udall appeared poised to be re-elected easily. But the entrance of Republican Rep. Cory Gardner into the contest -- as well as President Obama\u2019s continued unpopularity in the state -- has made the race a tossup. Gardner (pictured) has aligned Udall with Obama and his policies, while Udall has characterized his opponent as too conservative for the Centennial State.\n\nBut immigration may end up being the deciding factor in this closely watched contest. According to a June report from polling firm Latino Decisions, 63 percent of Colorado residents know an undocumented immigrant, and 35 percent know someone who has been deported or detained for being in the country illegally -- suggesting that the issue has a personal connection to most Coloradoans. Further, Hispanics make up 14 percent of the state\u2019s electorate.\n\nGiven that the issue resonates so strongly there it\u2019s entirely feasible that the race could swing in either direction, based on where the candidates stand. A recent Denver Post article examined each man\u2019s nuanced position on immigration reform. In a nutshell: Both want to see immigration reform, but Gardner\u2019s support is more contingent upon securing the border.\n\nArizona Governor\n\nAlthough Democrats have a strong, moderate nominee for governor in Fred DuVal, it\u2019s likely that Arizona\u2019s next chief executive will be the winner of this month\u2019s GOP primary. RCP rates the red state\u2019s gubernatorial race \u201cleans GOP.\u201d\n\nAnd the future Republican nominee will have to credit his or her stance on immigration for victory. State Treasurer Doug Ducey, businesswoman Christine Jones, and Mesa Mayor Scott Smith -- the top-tier GOP candidates -- each told RCP that immigration has taken over the election since the border crisis began earlier this summer. They added that it\u2019s almost always the first issue brought up by voters at campaign events. Like Udall and Gardner in Colorado, the three have multi-layered views on how to handle immigration. In short, all emphasize (to varying degrees) increased border security, though Smith backs a pathway to citizenship. For a closer look at each candidate\u2019s positions, read this.\n\nThe race may eventually have national implications, as the Grand Canyon State\u2019s governor will likely become one of the most recognizable leaders on immigration in the country. Voters will soon decide if it\u2019s to be a hardline or moderate voice.\n\nColorado\u2019s 6th Congressional District\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that Democrats will regain control of the House this year, but there are several competitive races that could shrink the GOP majority -- or add to it. One of those close contests is taking place in Colorado\u2019s 6th District, where 20 percent of residents identify as Hispanic.\n\nRepublican Rep. Mike Coffman, who takes Spanish lessons in his free time, has moderated his immigration positions since redistricting left him more vulnerable. His opponent -- former Colorado House Speaker Andrew Romanoff -- has called out Coffman for backing off his previous hardline positions. But Romanoff, who supports federal reform, may have some trouble of his own on the issue, as he helped broker state legislation in 2006 that denied some public services to undocumented immigrants.\n\nWith plenty of material for both campaigns, immigration will stay on voters\u2019 minds in this bellwether race.\n\nNew Mexico Governor\n\nPolitical analysts don\u2019t expect New Mexico\u2019s gubernatorial race to be particularly close. RCP rates it as \u201cleans GOP,\u201d and a recent poll showed incumbent Gov. Susana Martinez leading her opponent by nine percentage points. Although she\u2019s a Republican -- and is often discussed as a possible GOP vice presidential pick -- Martinez will probably win big in a blue state that\u2019s 40 percent Hispanic.\n\nYet, immigration remains an issue in this contest. Martinez supports comprehensive immigration reform, as does her opponent, New Mexico Attorney General Gary King. But she has localized the topic by taking issue with the state\u2019s policy of granting driver\u2019s licenses to illegal immigrants, and King\u2019s support of that practice. Martinez has also attacked King for \u201cfailing to lead on border security.\u201d\n\nImmigration won\u2019t decide this race. But if Martinez wins big among Hispanics and independents, expect national Republicans to take note. Her margin of victory, and the positions she stresses during the campaign, could end up shaping how major GOP candidates handle the issue in the future.\n\nTexas\u2019 23rd Congressional District\n\nFreshman Rep. Pete Gallego, a Democrat, knew when he was elected that holding onto his job wouldn\u2019t be easy. His district -- which include about 800 miles of border with Mexico -- preferred Romney over Obama in 2012 (and leans slightly Republican). Incumbency isn\u2019t a guarantee of victory either: Texas\u2019 23rd has gone from Democratic to Republican to Democratic in the last two elections.\n\nOne way that Gallego might stave off challenger Will Hurd, a former CIA agent, is by tying the political newcomer to the Texas GOP\u2019s immigration plank, which was hardened earlier this year.\n\nHurd\u2019s only mention of immigration in the \u201cIssues\u201d section of his campaign website indicates that he will make \u201cborder security, countering drug traffickers and fighting cyber criminals a national intelligence priority.\u201d But the Texas GOP goes much further: Its plank opposes in-state tuition rates for undocumented immigrants and bans so-called sanctuary cities (which do not enforce many federal immigration laws). The new plank also removed a call for a national guest-worker program present in an earlier version.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The second of a five-part special report,", "title": "Races Where Immigration Is at Center Stage | RealClearPolitics", "og": {"url": "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2014/08/19/races_where_immigration_is_at_center_stage_123688.html", "image": "http://images.rcp.realclearpolitics.com/248044_5_.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The second of a five-part special report,", "title": "Races Where Immigration Is at Center Stage | RealClearPolitics"}, "twitter": {"site": "@rcp_articles", "card": "summary"}, "tweetmeme-title": "Races Where Immigration Is at Center Stage | RealClearPolitics", "fb": {"app_id": 1415921935346245}, "keywords": "pete gallego,Susana Martinez,Andrew Romanoff,mike coffman,christine jones,scott smith,Doug Ducey,Fred DuVal,Cory Gardner,mark udall,Election 2014,immigration reform,", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc49c\"", "article_summary": "Here\u2019s a sampling of races in which immigration remains a potentially pivotal issue:Colorado SenateA year ago, Sen.
