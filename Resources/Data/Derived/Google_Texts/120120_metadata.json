Ziccardi said crews from Glenwood Springs and Basalt have been requested, adding that flames are still showing from the power plant.\n\nThe large power plant facility is located off Interstate 70 about 25 miles east of Glenwood Springs. The fire was first reported about 4 a.m.\n\n\u201cThe building is not gone,\u201d she said. \u201cAs far as you can see, it\u2019s mostly exterior.\u201d\n\nThe plant, when it opened in December 2013, was the first of its kind in the state. Operated by Holy Cross Energy, the project was touted by U.S. Sen. Mark Udall as a way to \u201creduce wildfire risks, create jobs and generate renewable energy sources.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the energy provider could not be immediately reached.\n\nThe 10-megawatt power plant helps provide energy to about 55,000 customers in Eagle, Pitkin, Garfield, Gunnison and Mesa counties, according to Udall\u2019s office.\n\nThis is a developing story that will be updated as more information becomes available.\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JesseAPaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Gypsum biomass power plant burning in active, three-alarm fire", "title": "Gypsum biomass power plant burning in active, three-alarm fire", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/13/gypsum-biomass-power-plant-burning-in-active-three-alarm-fire/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141213_111030_biomass-fire-1.jpg", "height": 438}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141213_111030_biomass-fire-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-13T09:06:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:23:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2378\"", "article_summary": "Fire crews from across the Western Slope are being summoned to assist in battling an active, three-alarm fire at a biomass power plant in Gypum on Saturday morning.\nThe large power plant facility is located off Interstate 70 about 25 miles east of Glenwood Springs.\nZiccardi said crews from Glenwood Springs and Basalt have been requested, adding that flames are still showing from the power plant.\nZiccardi said the power plant, which burns beetle-kill timber, has been taken out of service because of the blaze.\nThe 10-megawatt power plant helps provide energy to about 55,000 customers in Eagle, Pitkin, Garfield, Gunnison and Mesa counties, according to Udall\u2019s office."}
