Two groups have formed in expectation of support for the fall bond; a third, unhappy with the initial Project Connect plans, expects to oppose the bond.\n\nThe latest entry into the local mass transit discussion is \u201cAustin Gets Around,\u201d which describes itself on its Facebook and web pages as a \u201cgrassroots movement that informs and inspires the energy to improve transportation options in Central Texas.\u201d\n\nAGA (not yet a formal political action committee) has scheduled a launch party for Wednesday, April 16 at Mettle (507 Calles St.). While the group\u2019s early statements promote general improvement of \u201call transportation options,\u201d its logo and vision statement are rail-centric: \u201cTransportation is inextricably tied to many other concerns in our city: affordability, economic development, efficient use of financial and natural resources - by failing to improve how we get around Austin we are failing to address a myriad of issues. The most immediate way Austin Gets Around wants to help is to build excitement for Urban Rail.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Greg Hartman, a chief administrator at Seton Healthcare, recently formed the \u201cLet\u2019s Go Austin\u201d PAC to support the \u201ctransportation bond for City of Austin.\u201d Hartman is a longtime go-to organizer on bond issues, having experience with AISD bonds, the medical school vote, and many other community efforts. Let\u2019s Go Austin is in the early formation stage, but Hartman told Newsdesk, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking at raising money and then hopefully be able to educate city officials, community leaders, and then voters if this moves forward and becomes a sort of thing that we hope the community can support as a new transportation solution.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re just waiting to let the process happen,\u201d Hartman said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not trying to use the PAC to influence that process right now. Assuming something gets on the ballot for November, the PAC will be used to help raise funds to help build a campaign around transportation investment on the November ballot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe real work,\u201d Hartman said, \u201cbegins once we see what is actually proposed, and what it looks we\u2019re going to be building, and what\u2019s going to be offered for the voters,\u201d a process expected to be completed over the summer.\n\nFinally, the Scott Morris-led \u201cOur Rail\u201d PAC was recently formed as well, and is an unofficial extension of the ongoing argument over the preliminary Central Corridor Advisory Group route recommendation to build a \u201cHighland sub-corridor\u201d rail line (running along the western side of the UT-Austin campus to the Highland neighborhood). According to its treasurer filing, \u201cOur Rail\u201d was specifically formed \u201cto support a city charter amendment to designate the Guadalupe-North Lamar corridor to receive top priority for a light rail transit alignment\u201d and \u201cto oppose the 'Project Connect' Mass Transit Referendum,\u201d or \u201cA ballot measure authorizing a mass transit alignment serving the City Manager-recommended sub-corridors approved by Austin City Council on 12/12/13\" (i.e., the Highland sub-corridor).\n\nMorris confirmed that the PAC aims \u201cto oppose any Highland rail route.\u201d More generally, Morris wrote, \u201cOur Rail committee members and our donors think that the voters of Austin deserve a choice of where the initial light rail should go, not an up-or-down decision on the outgoing council's alignment preference.\u201d (See also, \u201cProject Connect: Phases and Stages,\u201d April 4.)\n\nAccording to Morris, petitioning a charter amendment onto the November ballot is only a possible option; if the group does go forward, its proposed amendment would likely mandate an East Riverside-to-Lamar line, connected by a bridge over Lady Bird Lake. By having \u201ca true choice on the ballot,\u201d said Morris, \u201cAustinites could move forward with an affirmative decision on light rail, while at the same time rejecting a poorly formed plan.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Groups organizing for and against potential bond proposition", "og": {"image": "http://www.austinchronicle.com/imager/b/original/1530016/f86b/AustinGetsAroundLogo.jpg", "title": "November Calling: PACs Form on Rail Vote"}, "keywords": "Austin Gets Around, Bonds, Greg Hartman, Let's Go Austin, November 2014 Election, Our Rail, Scott Morris, Urban Rail", "google-site-verification": "qnrKtufqpmTjGUn37hMteGd7m_7o98t42RcbtZJAXRs", "viewport": "width=device-width initial-scale=1.0 maximum-scale=1.0 user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Austin Gets Around, Bonds, Greg Hartman, Let's Go Austin, November 2014 Election, Our Rail, Scott Morris, Urban Rail"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfefc\"", "article_summary": "As November\u2019s expected vote on a transportation bond nears, Austinites are beginning to form groups and taking positions on mass transit.\nTwo groups have formed in expectation of support for the fall bond; a third, unhappy with the initial Project Connect plans, expects to oppose the bond.\nBy having \u201ca true choice on the ballot,\u201d said Morris, \u201cAustinites could move forward with an affirmative decision on light rail, while at the same time rejecting a poorly formed plan.\u201d\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not trying to use the PAC to influence that process right now.\nFinally, the Scott Morris-led \u201cOur Rail\u201d PAC was recently formed as well, and is an unofficial extension of the ongoing argument over the preliminary Central Corridor Advisory Group route recommendation to build a \u201cHighland sub-corridor\u201d rail line (running along the western side of the UT-Austin campus to the Highland neighborhood)."}
