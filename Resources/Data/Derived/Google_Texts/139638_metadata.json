I think that\u2019s a testament to our 26-year track record of success in Medicaid managed care, and the fact that we are a nonprofit company with a different business model.\u201d\n\nAs a nonprofit, CareSource has low administration costs and spends at least 90 percent of its revenue on direct medical care for consumers, setting it apart from the for-profit health insurers that bid for contracts. The company had total revenue of $5.4 billion in 2014.\n\n+ CareSource president and CEO Pamela Morris announces that Dayton-based CareSource has been selected to provide Medicaid managed care services for an ... read more \u00d7\n\nBeginning next July, CareSource will compete for enrollment with Anthem, Centene and WellCare \u2014 health insurers already operating in the state with the largest share of the market.\n\nBut Morris described the state\u2019s initial projections for CareSource\u2019s share of the total 1.3 million low-income Medicaid beneficiaries in Georgia as a conservative estimate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an estimate; we expect the number to be higher,\u201d Morris said, noting that Georgia has not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act and also does not pay for managed health care services for the state\u2019s aged, blind and disabled \u2014 populations that could come online in the future.\n\nIn Ohio, Gov. John Kasich\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid eligibility to most low-income, able-bodied individuals has swelled the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls by more than 600,00. At the same time, CareSource has added more than 350,000 expanded Medicaid recipients in Ohio and Kentucky, which also expanded eligibility under the federal health care reform law.\n\nCareSource, whose total membership grew from 1 million to 1.4 million last year, also has plans to expand its Medicaid program into other states, including Indiana, where it formerly provided Medicaid managed care services, and potentially North Carolina, which doesn\u2019t have a medicaid managed care program but is considering adopting the model.\n\nIn addition to its Medicaid programs, CareSource also is a leading provider of ACA qualified commercial health insurance plans, sold under the brand name Just4Me in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky.\n\nMorris was quick to point out the company\u2019s growth and plans for expansion will create jobs in Dayton rather than take them away, as some community leaders may fear.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping there will be other opportunities to grow,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when CareSource grows, whether it\u2019s in Ohio or outside the state, Ohio always wins because we always add people here. Downtown Dayton is home to CareSource\u2019s corporate headquarters, and we remain committed to being an anchor for the city.\u201d\n\nCareSource, with a total workforce of 2,427 and annual revenue of currently has about 2,000 employees in downtown Dayton spread among three locations, including the headquarters, a call-center and recently expanded office space in the Ballpark Village area downtown. The new hires in Dayton supporting the Georgia expansion will work at existing locations.", "article_metadata": {"description": "CareSource\u2019s announcement Wednesday that it plans to open a regional headquarters in Atlanta and hire 300 workers, including about 100 in Dayton, is just the latest milestone for the fast-growing health insurer whose total membership surged 40 percent last year alone.", "author": "By Randy Tucker - Staff Writer", "og": {"url": "http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/caresource-to-add-300-jobs-as-its-opens-regional-h/nncMb/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2015/09/10/65/c1/Care-Source-2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "CareSource\u2019s announcement Wednesday that it plans to open a regional headquarters in Atlanta and hire 300 workers, including about 100 in Dayton, is just the latest milestone for the fast-growing health insurer whose total membership surged 40 percent last year alone.", "title": "CareSource to begin hiring here as it expands in Georgia"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/09/09/90/19/ddn032511growth03.jpg", "description": "CareSourse announced plans to add 300 jobs as it establishes a southern regional headquarters.", "card": "summary", "title": "CareSource plans HQ in Atlanta"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myddn", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.mydaytondailynews.com/news/news/caresource-to-add-300-jobs-as-its-opens-regional-h/nncMb/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3057699/news/news/caresource-to-add-300-jobs-as-its-opens-regional-h/nncMb/", "keywords": "b2bnewsletter", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "CareSource President and CEO Pamela Morris said the company would begin hiring immediately for its expansion into Georgia and have a leadership team in place in Atlanta by the end of the year, following its successful bid to provide Medicaid managed care services for an estimated 200,000 Georgia beneficiaries.\nCareSource, Ohio\u2019s largest Medicaid managed care provider, was the only new vendor among the four companies that received contracts earlier this week from the Georgia Department of Community Health after intense statewide competitive bidding, Morris said.\n\u201cBut when CareSource grows, whether it\u2019s in Ohio or outside the state, Ohio always wins because we always add people here.\nAt the same time, CareSource has added more than 350,000 expanded Medicaid recipients in Ohio and Kentucky, which also expanded eligibility under the federal health care reform law.\nThe new hires in Dayton supporting the Georgia expansion will work at existing locations."}
