It has recently turned its focus to the U.S. and Brazilian markets by taking up a majority stake last year in Silicon Valley-based e-payment company Rixty Inc for an undisclosed sum.\n\nMOL executives did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDeutsche Bank declined to respond to queries while Credit Suisse was not immediately available to comment.\n\nMOL might be the biggest listing this year for Tan, who as Malaysia's 10th richest man with a net worth of $1.3 billion, made his fortune running businesses from lotteries to hotels and fastfood franchises.\n\nHe plans to list Seven Convenience, operator of all 7-11 stories in Malaysia in a $250 million IPO in March. Sources have also said Tan is exploring a listing of Welsh football team Cardiff City on Singapore's small cap Catalist exchange.\n\nLast year, Tan listed two smaller Malaysian companies for a combined 100 million ringgit ($30.33 million).", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Reuters Editorial", "Author": "Reuters Editorial", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "MOL Global Pte, a Malaysianonline payment company owned by billionaire Vincent Tan, haspicked Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse AG to work on a $300million U.S. IPO, said a person with direct knowledge of theplans.", "title": "Malaysia's MOL picks Deutsche, Credit Suisse for $300 mln U.S IPO -
