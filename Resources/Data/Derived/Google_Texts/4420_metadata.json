Of course, we\u2019ve had our share of bad lawmakers, media stars who have made fools of themselves and professional athletes that have taken advantage of their fame and power. They aren\u2019t the only people who deserve coal in their stockings this year, however. Here are five more recent contenders we should say bah humbug to.\n\n1) The lying witness from the Michael Brown grand jury. Almost everyone who read the journal entries that \u201cWitness 40\u2033 submitted to the grand jury hearing on Michael Brown\u2019s death felt there was something a little off in the testimony. From the bizarre opening of, \u201cWell I\u2019m gonna take my random drive to Florissant. Need to understand the black race better so I stop calling blacks niggers and start calling them people. Like dad always said, you can\u2019t fear or hate an entire race cause [sic] of what one man did 40 years ago,\u201d to a narrative that conveniently supported every allegation made by police office Darren Wilson when he claimed his murder of the unarmed teen was justified, the entire diary appeared highly suspicious.\u201dState prosecutors asked [Sandra] McElroy to testify during the grand jury hearing one day after she met with federal investigators, and she told the panel that she had written down her account the day of the fatal shooting \u2013 although she hadn\u2019t mentioned the journal the day before,\u201d reports Raw Story. \u201cShe returned 11 days later, as prosecutors asked, with handwritten journal pages.\u201d The site also reports that, \u201cThe FBI special agent interviewing McElroy doubted she was actually at the scene of the shooting, and noted that McElroy had expressed a desire to help Wilson.\u201d\n\nMcElroy\u2019s testimony helped lead to a grand jury decision not to pursue charges against Wilson in Brown\u2019s death.\n\n2) George Zimmerman\u2019s friend who decided maybe Zimmerman was guilty after all. While in Missouri, Wilson was able to get away with a deadly racial profiling act thanks to supportive witnesses, in Florida George Zimmerman did the same with the help of his own character witnesses. One of his friends, however, has decided two years later that maybe Zimmerman\u2019s murder of African American teen Trayvon Martin was an act of racism versus an act of self-defense.\n\n\u201cFrank Taaffe served on the neighborhood watch with the man accused of killing Trayvon Martin and vocally supported him throughout his trial. But months after Zimmerman was acquitted, Taaffe told Orlando\u2019s News 13 that his neighbor should have been found guilty,\u201d reports New York Daily News. \u201cHe told the TV station that the incident stemmed from the color of Trayvon\u2019s skin. \u2018What I know of George and his tendencies and also my opinion is that he racially profiled Trayvon Martin that night,\u2019 he said. \u2018If that had been a white kid on a cellphone, walking through our neighborhood, he wouldn\u2019t have stayed on him the way he did, and that\u2019s a fact, and I believe that in my heart.\u2019\u201d\n\nTaaffe defended Zimmerman in the media prior to Zimmerman\u2019s trial, but now says he will testify against him in a grand jury surrounding Martin\u2019s death, citing the loss of family members as the reason he has changed his view. Apparently it was impossible for him to feel compassion for Martin\u2019s family until he had his own deaths to compare it to.\n\n3) \u201cPublic servant\u201d Officer White. Obviously, racial tensions are at a fever pitch, especially between law enforcement and every day citizens. Things only get worse when you have a police officer with a Twitter account that he uses to stir up more controversy. Enter San Jose police officer Phillip White, who has spent the last few weeks taunting those who have been protesting the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. \u201cBy the way, if anyone feels they can\u2019t breathe or their lives matter I\u2019ll be at the movies tonight, off duty, carrying my gun,\u201d he recently said in a now deleted tweet, as one of many that were deemed racist and unprofessional. White has now been put on administrative leave.\n\n4) Internet \u201cjournalist\u201d Charles C. Johnson. Johnson was probably already on the naughty list when he offered a $1000 reward for anyone who could get him a photo of Mississippi Senator Thad Cochran\u2019s wife in her nursing home. His place was no doubt sealed however when he decided his job was to \u201cdoxx\u201d or out the previously anonymous \u201cJackie,\u201d the woman at the center of a controversial and now pulled Rolling Stone article on campus rape. Regardless of whether \u201cJackie\u201d was telling the truth, was confused and traumatized, embellished her account or outright lied, revealing private information about an otherwise anonymous person so a mass of strangers can contact and harass that person is always wrong.\n\n5) Phyllis Schlafly. Okay, to be fair, Schlafly, the anti-feminist, has likely been on the naughty list for decades now. Yet she has to get a special honor this year for escalating her \u201cwar on men, feminists are evil\u201d rhetoric to an even higher level than ever before. Schlafly, like most conservative pundits, has taken a skeptical eye to the Rolling Stone rape investigation, and, despite all evidence to the contrary, has decided that there is likely no issues with sexual assault at colleges to begin with.\n\nNo, according to her, higher education is a dangerous place \u2014 but only for male students. \u201cIt\u2019s really dangerous for a guy to go to college these days. He\u2019s better off if he doesn\u2019t talk to any women when he gets there. The feminists are perfectly glad to make false accusations and then claim all men are capable of some dastardly deed like rape,\u201d she told WND.com, adding, \u201cThere isn\u2019t any rape culture. There is a war on men, and [feminists] are very open about it.\u201d\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s time to keep those poor men safe by making them stay home.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Looks like these five people won't be getting off the naughty list anytime soon.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3126/3125509.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "phyllis schlafly,charles c. johnson,phillip white,george zimmerman,eric garner,darren wilson,", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "They aren\u2019t the only people who deserve coal in their stockings this year, however.\n1) The lying witness from the Michael Brown grand jury.\nAlmost everyone who read the journal entries that \u201cWitness 40\u2033 submitted to the grand jury hearing on Michael Brown\u2019s death felt there was something a little off in the testimony.\nWith just a few days left before Christmas, it\u2019s the time of the year that people are divided up into naughty and nice.\n2) George Zimmerman\u2019s friend who decided maybe Zimmerman was guilty after all."}
