Looking ahead at 2016, both provider organization executives and software vendors say their efforts will continue to shift from using data analytics to maximize reimbursement under the fee-for-service system to a focus on achieving better outcomes and partnering with others in the care continuum.\n\nAs acute-care hospitals are taking a data-driven approach to post-discharge efficiency, comparing post-acute providers based on clinical and operational performance metrics. With the penalty structure in place for preventable readmissions, they can\u2019t afford not to.\n\nThe transition to value-based payment is shifting the conversation to the measurement of success, according to Steven Littlehale, chief clinical officer at Cambridge, Mass.-based PointRight Inc., which provides predictive analytics services to post-acute providers.\n\nThat type of measurement, however, has never been a strong point of the skilled nursing facility (SNF) sector. \u201cTo this day, we do not know how much it costs to care for certain patient types within our SNF environments. We have no idea,\u201d Littlehale says. \u201cThat is just one example of how the absence of data has been such a long-term issue in our industry. We can\u2019t demonstrate the value we have. We can\u2019t demonstrate we are an exceptional provider of care.\u201d But these days, he adds, you must have the data to justify your existence.\n\nProviders today need to know how they perform on outcome measures relative to peers and national benchmarks, notes John Damgaard, CEO of Bloomington, Minn.-based MatrixCare, an electronic health record (EHR) provider for the LTPAC setting. \u201cMore importantly, if they are failing in a particular area, why is that? Overall prescribing of anti-psychotics might be OK, but if you dig down and region one of nine is off, then you can drill down to line of service, and see that it is one doctor who seems to be prescribing 10 times more than anyone else.\u201d\n\nRegarding the shift in relationships with hospitals, Damgaard says one LTPAC customer put it to him this way: \u201cFive years ago we used to take flowers and cookies to the hospital to get their referrals. Now we take our charts and graphs. Tomorrow we\u2019re going to take our contract lawyers, because we are going to be signing into bundled payments and other types of capitated arrangements with our partners in the spectrum of care.\u201d\n\nRetrospective vs. real-time data\n\nNow that many providers can pull clinical data from the EHR, they are starting to access data that is fresher than the retrospective information provide by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. \u201cWe believe the data has got to be near real-time,\u201d Damgaard says. \u201cIt is kind of interesting what happened 60 days ago, and it might help shape behaviors and improve processes, but 60 days is a long time in today\u2019s world. You may have spent a quarter-million dollars of margin you didn\u2019t need to spend in the last 60 days just in one practice area.\u201d\n\nLittlehale stresses that providers need both retrospective and near-real-time data. For quality improvement analysis, it doesn\u2019t matter if your data is six months old. \u201cThe data is not changing that dramatically,\u201d he says. If you look at re-hospitalization rates over the last year, you are not going to see a lot fluctuation. Any downward trend is going to be slight at best, and that is just the nature of this kind of data. \u201cBut when it comes to moving the needle, you need real-time data,\u201d he added. \u201cIf you are trying to make changes at the bedside or decisions about acquisition or divestiture, having real-time data points can help you make better decisions.\u201d\n\nIn general, Littlehale says, LTPAC providers have made gradual progress. \u201cI think we are maturing to realize that there is a difference between data and analytics and a difference between analytics and insight. But if you think of that as a hierarchy, most providers are at that bottom level, saying OK, I need to have data.\u201d But having that data is not insight. \u201cThat requires someone to manipulate the data to have these aha moments, and the majority of people in the SNF space don\u2019t have the skills to manipulate the data, let alone case-mix adjust it and come up with the appropriate benchmarks.\u201d\n\nSome provider organizations turn to outside help for benchmarking. For instance, The Advisory Board Company\u2019s SNF Benchmark Generator tool is designed to help member SNFs position themselves in terms of relationships with health systems under bundled payment, so the main areas in the benchmark generator focus on utilization and financial metrics: length of stay, payments and volume.\n\n\u201cDepending on how the organization wants to initiate the conversation with the hospital, this tool gives our members the ability to benchmark against a cohort of post-acute providers on length of stay,\u201d says Jared Landis, an Advisory Board practice manager. \u201cThey can tell hospitals \u2018we are cognizant of length of stay and not abusing the Medicare system. We are keeping them an appropriate amount of time, as measured against the cohort.\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0370\"", "article_summary": "The Affordable Care Act provided a clear wakeup call to long-term and post-acute care (LTPAC) providers that they had to do a better job of measuring and reporting on quality.\nAs acute-care hospitals are taking a data-driven approach to post-discharge efficiency, comparing post-acute providers based on clinical and operational performance metrics.\n\u201cBut when it comes to moving the needle, you need real-time data,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThat is just one example of how the absence of data has been such a long-term issue in our industry.\nThe transition to value-based payment is shifting the conversation to the measurement of success, according to Steven Littlehale, chief clinical officer at Cambridge, Mass.-based PointRight Inc., which provides predictive analytics services to post-acute providers."}
