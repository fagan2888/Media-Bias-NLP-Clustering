No, technically, UND has no mascot.\n\nBut what appeared to be an on-air mistake during ESPN\u2019s March Madness coverage over the weekend left some viewers confused. The network flashed the University of North Dakota\u2019s old \u201cFighting Sioux\u201d logo alongside the Weber State Wildcats logo during a halftime report, according to Deadspin.\n\nDuring the 1930s, the university officially adopted the name \u201cFighting Sioux\u201d for its athletic teams. In 2005, UND was placed on a list of schools with Native American nicknames that the NCAA said were hostile and abusive, and therefore, had to be changed. In June 2012, the university dropped the Sioux logo as its nickname after Sioux County, home of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, voted 184 to 159 in favor of droppingit. Currently, state law prohibits the university from adopting a new team name until 2015.\n\nThe logo was designed by Ben Brien a UND graduate and a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians.\n\nUND lost its bid for the NCAA tournament to the Weber State Wildcats 88-67 in Saturday\u2019s game. The Wildcats have bested them in the tourney six times previously, ever since UND joined the Big Sky in July 2012.", "article_metadata": {"description": "ESPN Uses Old \u2018Sioux\u2019 Mascot in On-air Mixup", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "rcjohnson", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/17/espn-uses-old-sioux-mascot-air-mixup-154049", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/espn_und_mixup.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "ESPN Uses Old \u2018Sioux\u2019 Mascot in On-air Mixup"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-03-17T16:51-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/17/espn-uses-old-sioux-mascot-air-mixup-154049", "dc": {"title": "ESPN Uses Old \u2018Sioux\u2019 Mascot in On-air Mixup"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "ESPN Uses Old \u2018Sioux\u2019 Mascot in On-air Mixup"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdfa0d\"", "article_summary": "The network flashed the University of North Dakota\u2019s old \u201cFighting Sioux\u201d logo alongside the Weber State Wildcats logo during a halftime report, according to Deadspin.\nIn June 2012, the university dropped the Sioux logo as its nickname after Sioux County, home of the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, voted 184 to 159 in favor of droppingit.\nUND lost its bid for the NCAA tournament to the Weber State Wildcats 88-67 in Saturday\u2019s game.\nDuring the 1930s, the university officially adopted the name \u201cFighting Sioux\u201d for its athletic teams.\nBut what appeared to be an on-air mistake during ESPN\u2019s March Madness coverage over the weekend left some viewers confused."}
