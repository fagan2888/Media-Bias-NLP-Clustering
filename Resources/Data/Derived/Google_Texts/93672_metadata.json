(ERIC HASERT/TREASURE COAST NEWSPAPERS)</p>\n\nBy Isadora Rangel of TCPalm\n\nTreasure Coast lawmakers, who oppose expanding health care coverage to up to 650,000 people statewide, pay less than half for insurance through a taxpayer-subsidized plan than the average Floridian.\n\nAll but two local state legislators are enrolled in health care coverage offered to state employees, for which they pay $50 a month for an individual plan or $180 for a family plan. They also receive free dental insurance.\n\nThe only two legislators who aren\u2019t on the plan \u2014 Rep. Larry Lee Jr., D-Port St. Lucie, and Sen. Denise Grimsley, R-Sebring \u2014 voted this week in favor of the Senate version of Medicaid expansion, which would cover most people who don\u2019t earn enough to qualify for insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act but too much to receive Medicaid as it is today.\n\nFloridians insured through their employer pay on average $117 for an individual premium and $471 for a family plan per month, according to 2013 data from the nonpartisan Keiser Family Foundation.\n\nThe House on Friday killed the Senate proposal to draw down nearly $50 billion in Affordable Care Act dollars over eight years to help Floridians purchase private insurance if they work, are seeking work, attend school, are disabled or caring for a disabled relative. The program would have ended if the federal government reduced or cut its funding.\n\nAlthough there are 800,000 Floridians \u2014 about 30,000 Treasure Coast residents \u2014 who qualify for traditional Medicaid expansion, only 580,000 to 650,000 would have met the Senate requirements.\n\nAll Treasure Coast House Republicans \u2014 Debbie Mayfield of Vero Beach, Gayle Harrell of Stuart, MaryLynn Magar of Tequesta and Cary Pigman of Avon Park \u2014 voted against the Senate plan. All of them receive the state health insurance.\n\nLee, a State Farm insurance agency owner, said the plan isn\u2019t perfect but gave it a yes vote because he said it\u2019s time Florida addresses the uninsured. He pays about $400 a month for a private insurance plan, he said.\n\n\u201cI could go to the state and get insurance for $50,\u201d Lee said, \u201cbut that\u2019s not right. I\u2019d be up here as ... part of a Legislature not allowing people out there (to get insurance) working two jobs and making $20,000.\u201d\n\nMagar said Medicaid costs in Florida have soared over the years to almost one-third of the state budget and the Senate proposal would have eliminated the Medically Needy program, where people pay a monthly fee based on their income and become eligible for Medicaid if their health care expenses that month reach the fee amount.\n\nMayfield said she\u2019s against Medicaid expansion because it would add to the $18 trillion federal debt and defended getting her insurance through the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of what we have as state employees,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m not a state employee I\u2019m going to have to go out and seek my health insurance.\u201d\n\nAll Treasure Coast senators \u2014 Republicans Joe Negron of Stuart, Thad Altman of Rockledge and Grimsley \u2014 voted for the Senate Medicaid expansion version this week. Negron and Altman are insured through the state.\n\nState employees and lawmakers began contributing to health insurance in 2010 but lawmakers paid only $8.34 per month and $30 for a family premium until recently.\n\nNegron proposed in 2012 a measure to force lawmakers to pay the same as state employees, but met sharp opposition from Senate Democrats and Republicans, who argued they already sacrificed financially to be in the Legislature to get paid slightly less than $30,000 a year.\n\nLater during that year\u2019s legislative session, however, the Senate agreed to pay the same as state employees starting in 2013. The House followed suit in 2014.\n\nToday, 36 of 40 senators are enrolled in the state health insurance and 39 get the dental plan. In the 120-member House, 108 take advantage of the health plan but there are not numbers available on how many have dental benefits, said Michael Williams, Speaker Steve Crisafulli\u2019s spokesman. Information on the coverage of individual legislators isn\u2019t public so this article relied on information they provided.\n\nNegron, who in 2013 proposed a health care expansion plan similar to the one the Senate put forward this year, said expanding health coverage will alleviate the burden on hospitals that treat the uninsured.\n\nFlorida has relied on the Low Income Pool, a mix of state and federal dollars to help hospitals pay for indigent care, but the federal government announced last year its share would expire in 2015. That sent the House and Senate into a standoff over whether to expand Medicaid to cover the care of people the pool normally pays for. The feds indicated last month they will give $1 billion this year, a $300 million drop from last year.\n\nNegron said he doesn\u2019t see an issue with lawmakers accepting the state health coverage while denying to expand health care to uninsured Floridians.\n\n\u201cI think they are two completely different issues,\u201d Negron said.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Some Treasure Coast lawmakers benefit from lower insurance premiums while denying Medicaid expansion", "og": {"url": "http://www.tcpalm.com/news/politics/legislative-session-2015/some-treasure-coast-lawmakers-benefit-from-lower-insurance-premiums-while-denying-medicaid-expansion-335313021.html", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/xgr_medicaid_1_19312038_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "height": 424}, "type": "article", "description": "Local legislators who voted against the Medicaid expansion benefit from state-subsidized health insurance.", "title": "Some Treasure Coast lawmakers benefit from lower insurance premiums while denying Medicaid expansion"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.jrn.com/images/xgr_medicaid_1_19312038_ver1.0_640_480.jpg", "description": "Local legislators who voted against the Medicaid expansion benefit from state-subsidized health insurance.", "site": "@tcpalm", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Some Treasure Coast lawmakers benefit from lower insurance premiums while denying Medicaid expansion"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "p": {"domain_verify": "604b11bb0bd3ad98dc5997e1039fd66d"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/logo-tcp-icon-144.png", "__sync_contentCategory": "premium", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca7e\"", "article_summary": "Negron said he doesn\u2019t see an issue with lawmakers accepting the state health coverage while denying to expand health care to uninsured Floridians.\nAll of them receive the state health insurance.\nToday, 36 of 40 senators are enrolled in the state health insurance and 39 get the dental plan.\nAll Treasure Coast House Republicans \u2014 Debbie Mayfield of Vero Beach, Gayle Harrell of Stuart, MaryLynn Magar of Tequesta and Cary Pigman of Avon Park \u2014 voted against the Senate plan.\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOnce you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re below a certain point you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get health care through the Affordable Care Act, so we have a lot of patients caught in that,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Holbrook said."}
