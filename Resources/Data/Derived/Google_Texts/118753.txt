Presidential candidate and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson “apologized” on Wednesday for affirming that homosexuality is clearly a choice because people “go into prison straight—and when they come out, they’re gay,” but added that “the science is still murky on the issue.”

Carson did not address which scientific studies examining sexuality before and after incarceration he was citing.

The comments were made on CNN’s “New Day,” after being asked whether being gay was a choice. In a statement released later in the day, he backtracked and said, “I realized that my choice of language does not reflect fully my heart on gay issues.” He followed that up with the classic non-apology: “I apologize unreservedly to all that were offended.”

You may remember Dr. Ben Carson for making similar comments suitable for a neurosurgeon in 2013, when he compared the Affordable Care Act to slavery.

Vet your doctors, people, and always get a second opinion.

Carson has told Sean Hannity in a radio interview that he won’t be discussing gay rights for the remainder of his campaign, but it’s obviously not going to be a very long one, so enjoy this brief respite from stupidity while you can.
