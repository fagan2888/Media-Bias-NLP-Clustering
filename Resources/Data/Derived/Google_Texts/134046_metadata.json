Sheets was considered an ally of the tea party when he was first elected in 2010, but he said he has broadened his perspective.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve matured,\u201d he said. \u201cI got to the point of understanding the reality of where things are.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates are lawyers, but much of the common ground ends there.\n\nSheets paints a picture of a district sharing the prosperity of a booming state, but a district whose well-being needs the continued application of conservative principles.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s all about the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have seen the results of positive economic growth, linked back to the policies of low taxes and a common-sense regulatory environment.\u201d\n\nBut to Donovan, the task is to fulfill jobs she believes the Texas Legislature has left undone.\n\n\u201cThe issues in this campaign are similar to those of Texas as a whole \u2014 support for public education, access to health care, support for the infrastructure,\u201d Donovan said.\n\nThe Democrat criticized Gov. Rick Perry for refusing to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which she noted would have insured 1.5 million people in a state that has had the worst uninsured rate in the country.\n\n\u201cOnce Medicaid is back,\u201d she said, \u201cwe need to furnish the kind of assistance and support for low-income health clinics.\u201d\n\nSheets charges that his opponent underestimates the concerns by Texans over illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cThe reality is that we have a very open border,\u201d he said. \u201cThe feds are not securing that border. We in Texas have to step up to protect it. I\u2019m the only candidate in this race who seems to feel that way.\u201d\n\nThey both agree that improving education is a key issue \u2014 even though they disagree on the proper approach.\n\n\u201cDuring the last session, we listened to parents, we listened to teachers,\u201d Sheets said. \u201cWe are rolling back the number of standardized tests. We passed a law on charter schools to give the state the power to shut down the bad actors.\u201d\n\nDonovan, however, said one of her goals is repairing damage done to education by past actions of the Legislature. She blasts Sheets for voting for $5.4 billion in education cuts four years ago, noting that the Legislature later restored only part of that amount.\n\n\u201cThere is $2 billion that has to be replaced, part of it by the state surplus...but we might have to tap the rainy day funds,\u201d she said.\n\nThe campaign has not been free of attacks.\n\nSheets has accused Donovan of a \u201clack of leadership,\u201d noting that until recently, she served on the board of directors of Honors Academy, a nonprofit charter school based in Farmers Branch. The charter was revoked for failure to meet minimum academic standards.\n\nDonovan said that a district court reversed the revocation, although the reversal itself is now on appeal.\n\nFor her part, Donovan said that after Sheets accepted campaign money from the insurance industry, he authored a bill that would have made it easier for insurers to drop policyholders if they filed more than one claim.\n\nSheets replied that he later withdrew the bill.\n\nEarly voting continues through Friday.
