This legislative process was a test of whether or not we could find a reasonable solution to a policy issue posed by the new tech economy \u2014 and I strongly believe we succeeded.\n\nUnfortunately, critics of our approach \u2014 some of whom have genuine concerns, but many of whom are politically motivated given my campaign for California State Assembly \u2014 have continued to spread misinformation about the policy.\n\nIt is time to set the record straight and be clear about what the new law means and to dispel the most persistent fabrications about it.\n\nThese regulations are the direct result of discussions with a variety of people, including tenants, landlords, the hotel industry, the tourism community, neighborhood associations, home sharers, the city planners, the mayor\u2019s office, my fellow supervisors, and many others.\n\nLike all legislative processes, we all had different ideas for what the perfect solution should look like. But everyone agreed on one thing: the status quo is not working.\n\nEvery night hundreds of San Franciscans share their space with visitors from around the world. This activity is happening, and I am proud that rather than continue to ignore it, we chose to update outdated laws and put a balanced solution in place.\n\nThe heart of this legislation is about addressing housing affordability. How can we all afford to live in the San Francisco we love as it becomes increasingly expensive?\n\nWe know there are bad actors using illegal short-term rentals to push San Franciscans out of the city. Previous efforts to stop them had fallen short. There were no coherent enforcement structures in place. That\u2019s why we consolidated enforcement in one city department and imposed tough fines and potential criminal penalties on anyone taking housing off the market and turning any unit into a year-round vacation rental. We placed a limit on the number of days residents can rent their space if they\u2019re not present.\n\nBut we also knew that many San Francisco residents were sharing the homes they lived in and not taking much-needed housing off the market. Throughout this process, we have heard hours of testimony from seniors, students, families and artists who rely on this income to make ends meet and pay their rent or mortgage. These are our friends and neighbors. We have seen that home sharing, when regulated properly, could actually be a tool to make the city more affordable for more families.\n\nThe new law says that San Francisco residents who play by the rules, register their residence, pay their taxes, obtain liability insurance, abide by building safety and rent control rules, and do not profit wildly from sharing their space, can participate to a limited degree in short-term rentals.\n\nThis is the truth about the new short-term rental legislation. Ideally we could start to implement it and monitor our progress, and future supervisors could tweak it as necessary. Instead, opponents are saying that they will try to push a ballot measure on the issue in 2015. And you can be sure that whatever the they propose, it won\u2019t be the result of a thoughtful, inclusive legislative process. It will be a profoundly political effort based on a fictitious narrative about back taxes.\n\nContrary to claims by David Campos \u2014 my opponent in the upcoming election \u2014 claims echoed repeatedly without any fact checking, the new law does not let Airbnb or any hosting platform off the hook for $25 million in back taxes. In fact, I was the first elected office to publicly support the city\u2019s treasurer when he issued a ruling that the \u201ctransient occupancy tax\u201d or TOT applies to short-term rentals.\n\nMy legislation affirms the treasurer\u2019s existing powers to apply this tax and goes a giant step further by explicitly stating that hosts and hosting platforms must collect and deliver taxes to our city. I also pushed Airbnb to work with the treasurer to simplify TOT collection for short-term rentals.\n\nBefore the final board vote on my legislation, the treasurer issued a statement that said unequivocally that he has all the legal authority he needs to pursue back and future taxes. For two-plus years, I have stated publicly that the city should collect all taxes owed before any of the opponents focused on this issue. But the idea that we should not address the broken status quo until a full completion of a lengthy tax collection is a great political sound bite, not a real policy argument.\n\nThere\u2019s one more falsehood to call out regarding taxes. The ubiquitous $25 million figure is not a real estimate; it\u2019s a math error. We do not know the amount that past short-term renters and platforms owe. We do have a very rough estimate from San Francisco Chronicle reporter Carolyn Said that we could see $11 million or so annually in new taxes moving forward \u2014 funds we will be able to spend to build affordable housing, clean our streets and support the social safety net. But extrapolating back from the $11 million estimate and concluding that the back taxes owed are $25 million simply because the treasurer issued a ruling two-and-a-half years ago is absurd. It assumes the same level of activity over that time period, when in fact we know that short-term rentals have been growing exponentially.\n\nFinally, I want to respond directly to one other aspect of the anti-Airbnb rhetoric that\u2019s swirling around: the offensive suggestion that I would pursue legislation based on campaign spending by technology leaders on my behalf. Nothing could be farther from reality. I began to craft short-term rental regulations two years ago because I saw a housing policy challenge in San Francisco that needed to be solved \u2014 well before I even began to consider running for the State Assembly. I believe that new technology is creating the need for new policies, and I was elected to pass laws to solve problems.\n\nThe Board of Supervisors I\u2019ve presided over has worked tirelessly to address San Francisco\u2019s housing crisis by fighting evictions and approving the construction of new housing, with a focus on maximizing the number of affordable units. The work we\u2019ve done to regulate short-term rentals is in that same spirit.\n\nSan Francisco has always prided itself on innovation and openness. With this step, we continue to show the world that we are a leader not just in technology, but in government\u2019s response to technology. At our best, we do not run from tough challenges or grandstand from the sidelines; we work together to hammer out new and fair solutions.\n\nFeatured Image: Martin M303/Shutterstock", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "<a href=\"/contributor/david-chiu/\" title=\"Posts by David Chiu\" onclick=\"s_objectID='river_author';\" rel=\"author\">David Chiu</a> <span class=\"twitter-handle\">(<a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidChiu\" rel=\"external\">@DavidChiu</a>)</span>", "application-name": "TechCrunch", "twitter": {"description": "After two-and-a-half years of intense policy discussion and countless hours of public testimony, this week Mayor Ed Lee signed into law legislation I authored that will for the first time regulate\u2026", "title": "San Francisco\u2019s Short-Term Rental Solution | TechCrunch", "url": "http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/01/san-franciscos-short-term-rental-solution/", "image": {"src": "https://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/shutterstock_106245929.jpg?w=764&h=400&crop=1"}, "site": "@techcrunch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "object_type": "post", "excerpt": "After two-and-a-half years of intense policy discussion and countless hours of public testimony, this week Mayor Ed Lee signed into law legislation I authored that will for the first time regulate short-term rentals in San Francisco.
