NBC Miley Cyrus as Rep. Michele Bachmann and Taran Killam as House Speaker John Boehner send up government shutdown on “SNL” in “We Did Stop.”

On last night’s “Saturday Night Live,” host and musical guest Miley Cyrus helped the show send up the government shutdown in Washington with a parody of her hit music video “We Can’t Stop,” pointedly retitled “We Did Stop (The Government).”

The SNL bit laid the blame for the government shutdown squarely at the feet of the Republicans. The video showed SNL player Taran Killam dressed as Republican House Speaker John Boehner, and Cyrus as Minnesota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann, partying hard, and symbolically having their way with Uncle Sam, while Barack Obama (played by Jay Pharoah) looked on uninvolved and forlorn, locked outside this very unpatriotic house party.

Given that much of the shutdown is about public relations, one has to wonder if even a silly thing like an “SNL” parody might have some real-world effect, if Republican lawmakers get the sense that mainstream outlets are singling them out for ridicule. In a “Weekend Update” piece on the show, Boenher and the G.O.P. were both labelled “loser.” (So was the Affordable Care Act website–only because of reports of glitches due to too much demand for Obamacare.)
