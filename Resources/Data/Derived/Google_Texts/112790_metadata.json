We wanted to create a fun video that speaks to the diversity of our community, especially younger LGBT Americans, and raises awareness ahead of the February 15th deadline to enroll.\u201d\n\nKellan Baker, another steering committee member and fellow at the Center for American Progress, emphasised the importance of the Affordable Care Act for LGBT Americans in particular, as one in four low- and middle-income LGBT people were uninsured in 2014:\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is a critical opportunity for our community to access the health care we need. The law includes extensive new nondiscrimination provisions that protect LGBT people in every state. This is a big moment for our community \u2013 and we hope that videos like \u2018Obamacare Hallelujah\u2019 can help raise awareness and celebrate the law and what it means for our community.\u201d\n\nIf you need to enroll for care, or just want to find out more, head to Out2Enroll\u2019s website for more information.
