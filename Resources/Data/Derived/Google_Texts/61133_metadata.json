Fliers in coffee shops and bars are in, as are partnerships with community colleges and job training centers.\n\nMillennials are still a critical demographic for Obamacare, but young adults are being wooed very differently in Year Two of enrollment. They showed last year that they\u2019re not slackers when it comes to the health care law \u2014 disproving fears that they\u2019d feel too invincible to want insurance \u2014 so the approach now is quieter, better targeted, more local, according to advocates. And the data so far suggest it\u2019s on track, they say.\n\nAn HHS report released Tuesday showed millennials enrolling at a slightly higher rate than a year earlier. Individuals ages 18-34 comprised 26 percent of sign-ups in both the federal exchange and state-run exchanges through mid-January, compared to 25 percent of the HealthCare.gov tally during the first four months of the 2014 open enrollment period.\n\nOfficially, HHS cautions against drawing any conclusions from the demographic data to date because patterns could change. Yet if last year is any indication, the proportion of young adults will only increase as the Feb. 15 deadline nears. Like many Americans, they waited until the last minute to sign up last year \u2014 but they did sign up.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty happy with those numbers, and we expect it to be a surge toward the end as well,\u201d said Erin Hemlin, health care campaign director for the organization Young Invincibles.\n\nThat optimism contrasts with the earliest concerns, which included fears that many millennials would pay little attention or decide to forgo coverage because of other expenses such as cellphones or Netflix subscriptions. Plenty of Obamacare critics predicted the latter. They warned that having too few young, presumably healthy people in insurers\u2019 risk pools \u2014 to balance out the health care costs of an older, typically sicker population \u2014 would throw plans into a \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration ultimately fell short of its 2014 goal of having young adults hit 38 percent of total enrollees. But the 28 percent it got apparently provided enough stability for insurers. There\u2019s been virtually no death-spiral talk in 2015.\n\nSign-ups are the only available measure for this group since HHS has never given an age breakdown for actual policyholders. But between their own exchange plans and the coverage that many millennials obtained through a parent\u2019s plan, the uninsured rate among 19- to 34-year-olds fell from 27 percent in 2010 to 19 percent in 2014, according to the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nSuch progress may be a factor in why they\u2019re now getting less attention from the administration. In December 2013, for example, President Barack Obama held a strategy summit that drew more than 160 young people to the White House. A month later, he had lunch at a hangout in Northwest D.C. with representatives from groups such as Generation Progress and Young Invincibles.\n\nBy contrast, this season\u2019s youth summit was smaller, and Obama didn\u2019t make an appearance.\n\nBecause the Obama administration is talking less about youth enrollment, its foes have also moved on. Last year, Generation Opportunity, a libertarian-leaning group with ties to the Koch brothers, released a series of ads featuring \u201cCreepy Uncle Sam\u201d to discourage young people from enrolling. But this season, the group is putting its energy into other issues like higher education and unemployment, said communications director David Pasch.\n\n\u201cLast time, the White House and its allies spent millions of dollars trying to sucker us into a bad deal, so we felt a responsibility to provide the resources to help young people make the best health care decisions for themselves. Fast forward one year, and the president doesn\u2019t even feel the need to mention it during the State of the Union,\u201d Pasch said.\n\nObamacare advocates stress that the lower-key strategy reflects what has been learned about their target group\u2019s response to the health care law. A more direct, organic conversation, they say, works better than some broad, national push relying in part on pop stars, pro athletes or other big names.\n\nBuzz is definitely out. Even the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, the group responsible for those much ballyhooed brosurance spots, has transitioned to more research-driven ads that focus on the message, not the image.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we saw last year was engaging local leaders in communities and really having more localized efforts was in some ways even more important than engaging national celebrities,\u201d said Anne Filipic, president of Enroll America, an administration ally. The White House has \u201ctaken that to heart, and they\u2019ve done a lot of work to figure out how to amplify this at a local level and how to engage local leaders in the work.\u201d\n\nPartnerships with community colleges are being enhanced because they proved effective last year; in December, second lady Jill Biden met with about a dozen community college presidents to discuss ways, from workshops to one-on-one assistance, to help students get covered.\n\nEnroll America has expanded its own partnerships with schools and asked them to share sign-up information. As Filipic noted, students are much more likely to open an email that comes from their college. And this week, Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. is hosting a phone bank to reach African-American and Latino students at colleges and universities.\n\nAdvocates are also working with other millennial-focused sites or groups that don\u2019t normally deal in health care \u2014 from career-training institutes and youth ministries to LGBT groups and places popular with young adults.\n\nThe Michigan Primary Care Association, which is spearheading such efforts in that state, has been leaving sign-up information at bars, gyms and other businesses in collaboration with their owners and managers. At some coffee shops, the cardboard sleeves for lattes and other drinks now urge \u201cGet Covered, Stay Covered.\u201d Patrons of tattoo parlors and e-cigarette shops can read about Obamacare while they get inked or vape.\n\nOn Thursday, Young Invincibles and Enroll America will host the second annual National Youth Enrollment Day to reel in the procrastinators. The groups and their ally organizations will hold more than 200 events around the country and aim to inundate social media through Twitter chats \u2014 with the hashtag #YoEnroll \u2014 graphics and success stories.\n\nWhile these national organizations are sponsoring some city-specific events \u2014 including a live-music \u201cRock Enroll\u201d in Houston that drew over 2,500 people last Saturday and \u201cACA Block Parties\u201d around Atlanta this week \u2014 they\u2019re really trying to equip community leaders to host events tailored to their communities\u2019 specific needs, Hemlin said.\n\n\u201cThose types of events that are more localized and managed more by local leaders tend to have a lot more success,\u201d she said.\n\nAs the Feb. 15 deadline approaches, expect the messaging to ramp up, especially online. Young Invincibles and Enroll America found that the availability of premium subsidies and the threat of the individual mandate penalty were big motivators last year, so their final-days messaging will emphasize the financial aspects of Obamacare particularly and health care generally.\n\nEnroll America already has released graphics that calculate the cost of various health conditions in terms designed to hit home with millennials. The cost of a general sprain, for example, is worth 167 chicken burritos from Chipotle. And the cost of a urinary tract infection? As much as 423 gallons of gas.\n\nAuthors:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "The approach now is quieter, better targeted and more local, according to advocates.", "title": "Obamacare advocates refine their pitch to millennials", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/obamacare-millennials-114654.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2015/01/27/150127_obamacare_gty_1160.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Obamacare,Health Care,Millennials", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "The approach now is quieter, better targeted and more local, according to advocates.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce5c7\"", "article_summary": "Obamacare advocates stress that the lower-key strategy reflects what has been learned about their target group\u2019s response to the health care law.\nMillennials are still a critical demographic for Obamacare, but young adults are being wooed very differently in Year Two of enrollment.\n| Getty POLITICO Pro Obamacare advocates refine their pitch to millennialsGone are the splashy tweets about health coverage from Katy Perry and the \u201cbrosurance\u201d ads featuring guys doing keg stands.\nOn Thursday, Young Invincibles and Enroll America will host the second annual National Youth Enrollment Day to reel in the procrastinators.\nEnroll America already has released graphics that calculate the cost of various health conditions in terms designed to hit home with millennials."}
