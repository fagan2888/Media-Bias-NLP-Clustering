Since April, claimants of working age with a spare bedroom have received a reduced payment.\n\nThe figures were revealed by Harry Phibbs, a Tory councillor, in an investigation for the ConservativeHome website. He surveyed councils across the UK and 141 responded.\n\nIn their areas, 25,238 of the 233,732 people stripped of the spare bedroom subsidy \u2013 or nearly 11 per cent \u2013 were no longer claiming any benefits.\n\nFigures show the move has encouraged thousands to look for work\n\nMr Phibbs said that extended across the UK, it would be the equivalent of 71,000 out of the 660,000 claimants predicted to be affected stopping claiming benefits.\n\n\n\n\u2018Before this change it wasn\u2019t rewarding for people to work,\u2019 he said. \u2018This is giving people a reward for working \u2013 they are able to stay in their homes rather than downsizing into a smaller home.\n\n\u2018Because work is now being rewarded, many people are coming off benefits altogether and getting full-time jobs.\n\n\u2018I would expect you will see far more people coming in to jobs in the coming months.\u2019\n\n\n\nThe ending of the subsidy means that if tenants have one spare room, the amount of rent eligible for housing benefit is cut by 14 per cent. If they have two or more spare rooms, the reduction is 25 per cent.\n\nOn average, claimants receive \u00a315 a week less from the taxpayer. Council tenants get about \u00a314 a week less, while those in housing association properties get \u00a316 a week less.\n\n\n\nThe savings to the taxpayer from removing the subsidy are an estimated \u00a3505million in 2013-14, and \u00a3540million the year after.\n\nFigures obtained by Mr Phibbs show that in Tower Hamlets, East London, 948 out of 3,000 people (32 per cent) stopped claiming housing benefit, but in Liverpool only 300 claimants came off, out of 11,600.\n\nBromsgrove in Worcestershire saw 178 out of 605 come off benefits (29 per cent).\n\nThe responses do not give the reasons why individuals came off housing benefit, but any suggestion that the policy is helping families back into work is a huge boost for the Government.\n\nLeft-wing politicians and campaign groups repeatedly said the \u2018bedroom tax\u2019 would inflict misery on thousands.", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "One,10,come,benefits,losing,spare,room,subsidy,thanks,bedroom,tax", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2469751/One-10-come-benefits-losing-spare-room-subsidy-thanks-bedroom-tax.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "One in ten claimants stripped of the \u00a315-a-week spare room subsidy have come off benefits altogether, figures show.", "title": "One in 10 come off benefits after 'bedroom tax'", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2469751/One-10-come-benefits-losing-spare-room-subsidy-thanks-bedroom-tax.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/21/article-2469751-1B149CB6000005DC-923_636x382.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2469751, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "One,10,come,benefits,losing,spare,room,subsidy,thanks,bedroom,tax", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2013-10-20T23:44:18.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=James+Slack+for+the+Daily+Mail", "section": "News", "modified_time": "2013-10-21T06:56:11.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "One 10 come benefits losing spare room subsidy thanks bedroom tax"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "One in ten claimants stripped of the \u00a315-a-week spare room subsidy have come off benefits altogether, figures show.", "title": "One in 10 come off benefits after 'bedroom tax'", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2469751/One-10-come-benefits-losing-spare-room-subsidy-thanks-bedroom-tax.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/21/article-2469751-1B149CB6000005DC-923_636x382.jpg", "height": 382}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "News", "description": "One in ten claimants stripped of the \u00a315-a-week spare room subsidy have come off benefits altogether, figures show."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe29b5\"", "article_summary": "In their areas, 25,238 of the 233,732 people stripped of the spare bedroom subsidy \u2013 or nearly 11 per cent \u2013 were no longer claiming any benefits.\nBut, by encouraging people to stop claiming benefits such as jobseekers\u2019 allowance altogether, this figure doubles to around \u00a31billion-a-year.\nOne in 10 come off benefits after losing spare room subsidy thanks to 'bedroom tax'Freedom of Information requests show thousands who were stripped of tax have been encouraged to find workTen per cent of claimants have stopped receiving benefits altogetherThe change has given people 'reward for working' which wasn't there before, says Tory councillorOne in ten claimants stripped of the \u00a315-a-week spare room subsidy have come off benefits altogether, figures show.\nSince April, claimants of working age with a spare bedroom have received a reduced payment.\nMinisters had estimated that by removing the subsidy, paid to social housing tenants who have a spare room, the bill would be cut by around \u00a3500million a year."}
