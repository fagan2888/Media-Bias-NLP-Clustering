It\u2019s actually shocking how readily we have fallen into rhetoric that treats human beings as assets; it\u2019s closely related to the remarkable, equally shocking way that we now talk about medical patients as health care \u201cconsumers\u201d.\n\nBut I think there\u2019s a bit more to add.\n\nBranko says that the essential difference between skills and physical capital is that the former aren\u2019t worth anything unless you work, and that is certainly an essential difference. I would, however, also emphasize the flip side: if you think of capital as something that rentiers can own, which is surely one of the important things we connote when we use the c-word, then labor force skills are not capital in that sense. Children of the wealthy can inherit or buy factories and buildings; absent indentured servitude or the coming of androids, they can\u2019t buy worker skills.\n\nMeanwhile, Bruenig is unhappy with James Pethokoukis for trying to sell humanitarian policies, more or less, as a cynical pro-capitalist ploy (which is, to give credit where it\u2019s due, the opposite of the usual thing on the right). What I immediately noted was that Pethokoukis is wrong about what actually works in the direction he wants. He argues that big welfare states discourage having children, and dismisses pro-natalist policies as ineffectual. Here are fertility rates in advanced countries:\n\nPhoto\n\nThe two most extensive, generous welfare states in the world \u2014 France and Sweden \u2014 also have higher fertility than we do, significantly so in the case of France. And there\u2019s a reason: strong pro-natalist policies, which greatly reduce the burden, financial and otherwise, of raising children. As I\u2019ve written in the past, if you want to see policy informed by genuine family values \u2014 as opposed to \u201cpro-family\u201d values that are actually about patriarchy \u2014 France is a much better example than America.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20150221142748, "BN": "krugman", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/krugman", "DISPLAYDATE": "February 21, 2015", "keywords": "Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/krugman/People Aren't Androids ( 20150221 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "krugman", "sourceApp": "blogs", "twitter": {"description": "To be capital is inhuman.", "title": "People Aren't Androids", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/people-arent-androids/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@NytimesKrugman", "card": "summary"}, "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/krugman/post", "description": "To be capital is inhuman.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "February 21, 2015", "article": {"published_time": 1424546868, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2015-02-21T19:27:48-05:00"}, "utime": 20150221192748, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20150221, "pdate": 20150221, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Paul Krugman Blog", "description": "To be capital is inhuman.", "title": "People Aren't Androids", "url": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/people-arent-androids/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/21/people-arent-androids/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "People Aren't Androids", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca5c1\"", "article_summary": "Children of the wealthy can inherit or buy factories and buildings; absent indentured servitude or the coming of androids, they can\u2019t buy worker skills.\nBut I think there\u2019s a bit more to add.\nBranko says that the essential difference between skills and physical capital is that the former aren\u2019t worth anything unless you work, and that is certainly an essential difference.\nAnd there\u2019s a reason: strong pro-natalist policies, which greatly reduce the burden, financial and otherwise, of raising children.\nHe argues that big welfare states discourage having children, and dismisses pro-natalist policies as ineffectual."}
