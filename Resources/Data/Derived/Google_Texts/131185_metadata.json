We played hopscotch and jump rope and I loved them and always had scraped knees.\u201d\n\nRamona, perhaps her best-known character, made her debut in \u201cHenry Huggins\u201d with only a brief mention. But that changed soon.\n\n\u201cAll the children appeared to be only children so I tossed in a little sister and she didn\u2019t go away. She kept appearing in every book,\u201d she said in a telephone interview from her Carmel, California home. Cleary herself was an only child.\n\nHer birthday on Tuesday will be marked with a slice of carrot cake at her retirement home, where they\u2019ll show the movie \u201cDiscovering Beverly Cleary: An Oregon Art Beat.\u201d The documentary not only marks her 100th birthday but it also examines her Oregon roots, and the impact of her work.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t seen the film yet, but is quick to point out, \u201cI think I\u2019m much better looking in my photograph.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s also been known to joke that she doesn\u2019t look a day over 80.\n\nCleary, who started writing in her 30s, doesn\u2019t write anymore because she feels \u201cit\u2019s important for writers to know when to quit.\u201d\n\n\u201cI even got rid of my typewriter. It was a nice one but I hate to type. When I started writing I found that I was thinking more about my typing than what I was going to say, so I wrote it long hand.\u201d\n\nAlthough she hung up her pen, Cleary re-released three of her most cherished books with three famous fans writing forewords for the new editions.\n\nActress Amy Poehler penned the front section of \u201cRamona Quimby, Age 8;\u201d Kate DiCamillo wrote the opening for \u201cThe Mouse and the Motorcycle;\u201d and fellow author, Judy Blume, wrote the foreword for \u201cHenry Huggins.\u201d\n\nTrained as a librarian, Clearly first wrote \u201cHenry Huggins,\u201d published in 1950. Millions came to love the adventures of Huggins and neighbors Ellen Tebbits, Otis Spofford, Beatrice \u201cBeezus\u201d Quimby and her younger sister, Ramona. They inhabit a down-home, wholesome setting on Klickitat Street - a real street in Portland, Oregon, the city where Cleary spent much of her youth.\n\nThe Ramona character developed over time as Cleary thought of new stories for the young characters. In all, there were eight books on Ramona between \u201cBeezus and Ramona\u201d in 1955 and \u201cRamona\u2019s World,\u201d Cleary\u2019s last book, in 1999. Others included \u201cRamona the Pest\u201d and \u201cRamona and Her Father.\u201d\n\nIn 2003, she was chosen as one of the winners of the National Medal of Arts and met President George W. Bush. She is lauded in literary circles far and wide.\n\n\u201cA career that spans two centuries. A voice that children adore, listen to, and are comforted by. An imagination that has been alive and well for 100 years. Bev Cleary is clearly an icon \u2014 not just to kids but to writers like me who love seeing the smiles on the faces of youngsters who read our books instead of burying those faces in digital dumpsters,\u201d said children\u2019s author Howard Eisenberg, 89.\n\nAt the New York Public Library, Anna Taylor, coordinator of Children\u2019s Educational Programming, is collecting 100 stories from patrons and librarians about why they love Cleary.\n\nTaylor has her own reason, too.\n\n\u201cOne thing that is great about her books is they are a joy to read aloud. Every time I\u2019ve read a Beverly Cleary aloud, (the youngsters) just don\u2019t want me to stop. I think it\u2019s because Ramona and her friends feel like your sister, or yourself or your friends. You can kind of see yourself in the story really easily,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nCleary was born on April 12, 1916, in McMinnville, Oregon, and lived on a farm in Yamhill until her family moved to Portland when she was school-age. She was a slow reader, which she blamed on illness and a mean-spirited first-grade teacher who disciplined her by snapping a steel-tipped pointer across the back of her hands.\n\nBut by sixth or seventh grade, \u201cI decided that I was going to write children\u2019s stories,\u201d she said.\n\nCleary graduated from the University of California at Berkeley, where she met her husband, Clarence. They married in 1940; He died in 2004. They were the parents of twins, a boy and a girl born in 1955 who inspired her book \u201cMitch and Amy.\u201d\n\nHer days are quiet now, reading, doing crossword puzzles and visiting with family. \u201cI don\u2019t encourage visitors, my family is enough,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said her health is good. \u201cI\u2019m hanging in there, a few aches and pains.\u201d\n\nAsked her secret to living to be 100, the dry wit is evident again.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t do it on purpose,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As she turns 100, the feisty and witty author Beverly Cleary remembers the Oregon childhood that inspired the likes of characters Ramona and Beezus Quimby and Henry Huggins in the children's books that sold millions and enthralled generations of youngsters.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "As she turns 100, the feisty and witty author Beverly Cleary remembers the Oregon childhood that inspired the likes of characters Ramona and Beezus Quimby and Henry Huggins in the children\u2019s books that sold millions and enthralled generations of youngsters.", "title": "Author Beverly Cleary turns 100 with wit, candor", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/10/author-beverly-cleary-turns-100-with-wit-candor/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/10/beverly_cleary_turns_100.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2016/04/10/beverly_cleary_turns_100.jpeg", "description": "As she turns 100, the feisty and witty author Beverly Cleary remembers the Oregon childhood that inspired the likes of characters Ramona and Beezus Quimby and Henry Huggins in the children's books tha", "card": "summary", "title": "Author Beverly Cleary turns 100 with wit, candor"}, "Author": "KRISTIN J.
