It\u2019s part of a vast shift that could upend three decades of American political thinking. By Peter Beinart\n\nMaybe Bill de Blasio got lucky. Maybe he only won because he cut a sweet ad featuring his biracial son. Or because his rivals were either spectacularly boring, spectacularly pathological, or running for Michael Bloomberg\u2019s fourth term. But I don\u2019t think so. The deeper you look, the stronger the evidence that de Blasio\u2019s victory is an omen of what may become the defining story of America\u2019s next political era: the challenge, to both parties, from the left. It\u2019s a challenge Hillary Clinton should start worrying about now.\n\nTo understand why that challenge may prove so destabilizing, start with this core truth: For the past two decades, American politics has been largely a contest between Reaganism and Clintonism. In 1981, Ronald Reagan shattered decades of New Deal consensus by seeking to radically scale back government\u2019s role in the economy. In 1993, Bill Clinton brought the Democrats back to power by accepting that they must live in the world Reagan had made. Located somewhere between Reagan\u2019s anti-government conservatism and the pro-government liberalism that preceded it, Clinton articulated an ideological \u201cthird way\u201d: Inclined toward market solutions, not government bureaucracy, focused on economic growth, not economic redistribution, and dedicated to equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome. By the end of Clinton\u2019s presidency, government spending as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product was lower than it had been when Reagan left office.\n\nFor a time, small flocks of pre-Reagan Republicans and pre-Clinton Democrats endured, unaware that their species were marked for extinction. Hard as they tried, George H.W. Bush and Bob Dole could never muster much rage against the welfare state. Ted Kennedy never understood why Democrats should declare the era of big government over. But over time, the older generation in both parties passed from the scene and the younger politicians who took their place could scarcely conceive of a Republican Party that did not bear Reagan\u2019s stamp or a Democratic Party that did not bear Clinton\u2019s. These Republican children of Reagan and Democratic children of Clinton comprise America\u2019s reigning political generation.\n\nBy \u201cpolitical generation,\u201d I mean something particular. Pollsters slice Americans into generations at roughly 20-year intervals: Baby Boomers (born mid-1940s to mid-1960s); Generation X (mid-1960s to early 1980s); Millennials (early 1980s to 2000). But politically, these distinctions are arbitrary. To understand what constitutes a political generation, it makes more sense to follow the definition laid out by the early-20th-century sociologist Karl Mannheim. For Mannheim, generations were born from historical disruption. As he argued\u2014and later scholars have confirmed\u2014people are disproportionately influenced by events that occur between their late teens and mid-twenties. During that period\u2014between the time they leave their parents\u2019 home and the time they create a stable home of their own\u2014individuals are most prone to change cities, religions, political parties, brands of toothpaste. After that, lifestyles and attitudes calcify. For Mannheim, what defined a generation was the particular slice of history people experienced during those plastic years. A generation had no set length. A new one could emerge \u201cevery year, every thirty, every hundred.\u201d What mattered was whether the events people experienced while at their most malleable were sufficiently different from those experienced by people older or younger than themselves.\n\nMannheim didn\u2019t believe that everyone who experienced the same formative events would interpret them the same way. Germans who came of age in the early 1800s, he argued, were shaped by the Napoleonic wars. Some responded by becoming romantic-conservatives, others by becoming liberal-rationalists. What they shared was a distinct generational experience, which became the basis for a distinct intra-generational argument.\n\nGetty Images Barack Obama and Bill Clinton share a moment at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.\n\nIf Mannheim\u2019s Germans constituted a political generation because in their plastic years they experienced the Napoleonic Wars, the men and women who today dominate American politics constitute a political generation because during their plastic years they experienced some part of the Reagan-Clinton era. That era lasted a long time. If you are in your late 50s, you are probably too young to remember the high tide of Kennedy-Johnson big government liberalism. You came of age during its collapse, a collapse that culminated with the defeat of Jimmy Carter. Then you watched Reagan rewrite America\u2019s political rules. If you are in your early \u201840s, you may have caught the tail end of Reagan. But even if you didn\u2019t, you were shaped by Clinton, who maneuvered within the constraints Reagan had built. To pollsters, a late 50-something is a Baby Boomer and an early 40-something is a Gen-Xer. But in Mannheim\u2019s terms, they constitute a single generation because no great disruption in American politics divides them. They came of age as Reagan defined a new political era and Clinton ratified it. And as a rule, they play out their political struggles between the ideological poles that Reagan and Clinton set out.\n\nTo understand how this plays out in practice, look at the rising, younger politicians in both parties. Start with the GOP. If you look at the political biographies of nationally prominent 40-something Republicans\u2014Bobby Jindal, Scott Walker, Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz\u2014what they all have in common is Reagan. Jindal has said about growing up in Louisiana, \u201cI grew up in a time when there weren\u2019t a whole lot of Republicans in this state. But I identified with President Reagan.\u201d At age 17, Scott Walker was chosen to represent his home state of Colorado in a Boys Nation trip to Washington. There he met \u201chis hero, Ronald Reagan,\u201d who \u201cplayed a big role in inspiring me.\u201d At age 21, Paul Ryan interned for Robert Kasten, who had ridden into the Senate in 1980 on Reagan\u2019s coattails. Two years later he took a job with Jack Kemp, whose 1981 Kemp-Roth tax cut had helped usher in Reaganomics. Growing up in a fiercely anti-communist Cuban exile family in Miami, Marco Rubio writes in his autobiography that \u201cReagan\u2019s election and my grandfather\u2019s allegiance to him were defining influences on me politically.\u201d Ted Cruz is most explicit of all. \u201cI was 10 when Reagan became president,\u201d he told a conservative group earlier this year. \u201cI was 18 when he left the White House \u2026 I\u2019ll go to my grave with Ronald Wilson Reagan defining what it means to be president \u2026 and when I look at this new generation of [Republican] leaders I see leaders that are all echoing Reagan.\u201d\n\n\n\nYounger Democratic politicians are less worshipful of Clinton. Yet his influence on their worldview is no less profound. Start with the most famous, still-youngish Democrat, a man who although a decade older than Rubio, Jindal, and Cruz, hails from the same Reagan-Clinton generation: Barack Obama. Because he opposed the Iraq War, and sometimes critiqued the Clintons as too cautious when running against Hillary in 2008, some commentators depicted Obama\u2019s victory as a rejection of Clintonism. But to read The Audacity of Hope\u2014Obama\u2019s most detailed exposition of his political outlook\u2014is to be reminded how much of a Clintonian Obama actually is. At Clintonism\u2019s core was the conviction that to revive their party, Democrats must first acknowledge what Reagan got right.\n\nObama, in describing his own political evolution, does that again and again: \u201cas disturbed as I might have been by Ronald Reagan\u2019s election \u2026 I understood his appeal\u201d (page 31). \u201cReagan\u2019s central insight \u2026 contained a good deal of truth\u201d (page 157). \u201cIn arguments with some of my friends on the left, I would find myself in the curious position of defending aspects of Reagan\u2019s worldview\u201d (page 289). Having given Reagan his due, Obama then sketches out a worldview in between the Reaganite right and unreconstructed, pre-Reagan left. \u201cThe explanations of both the right and the left have become mirror images of each other\u201d (page 24), he declares in a chapter in which he derides \u201ceither/or thinking\u201d (page 40). \u201cIt was Bill Clinton\u2019s singular contribution that he tried to transcend this ideological deadlock\u201d (page 34). Had the term not already been taken, Obama might well have called his intermediary path the \u201cthird way.\u201d\n\nThe nationally visible Democrats rising behind Obama generally share his pro-capitalist, anti-bureaucratic, Reaganized liberalism. The most prominent is 43-year-old Cory Booker, who is famously close to Wall Street and supports introducing market competition into education via government-funded vouchers for private schools. In the words of New York magazine, \u201cBooker is essentially a Clinton Democrat.\u201d Gavin Newsom, the 45-year-old lieutenant governor of California, has embraced Silicon Valley in the same way Booker has embraced Wall Street. His book, Citizenville, calls for Americans to \u201creinvent government,\u201d a phrase cribbed from Al Gore\u2019s effort to strip away government bureaucracy in the 1990s. \u201cIn the private sector,\u201d he told Time, \u201cleaders are willing to take risks and find innovative solutions. In the public sector, politicians are risk-averse.\u201d Julian Castro, the 39-year-old mayor of San Antonio and 2012 Democratic convention keynote speaker, is a fiscal conservative who supports NAFTA.\n\nThe argument between the children of Reagan and the children of Clinton is fierce, but ideologically, it tilts toward the right. Even after the financial crisis, the Clinton Democrats who lead their party don\u2019t want to nationalize the banks, institute a single-payer health-care system, raise the top tax rate back to its pre-Reagan high, stop negotiating free-trade deals, launch a war on poverty, or appoint labor leaders rather than Wall Streeters to top economic posts. They want to regulate capitalism modestly. Their Reaganite Republican adversaries, by contrast, want to deregulate it radically. By pre-Reagan standards, the economic debate is taking place on the conservative side of the field. But\u2014and this is the key point--there\u2019s reason to believe that America\u2019s next political generation will challenge those limits in ways that cause the leaders of both parties fits.\n\nSee which celebrities support Bill de Blasio, one of the rising stars of the new new left.\n\nAmerica\u2019s youngest adults are called \u201cMillennials\u201d because the 21st century was dawning as they entered their plastic years. Coming of age in the 21st century is of no inherent political significance. But this calendric shift has coincided with a genuine historical disruption. Compared to their Reagan-Clinton generation elders, Millennials are entering adulthood in an America where government provides much less economic security. And their economic experience in this newly deregulated America has been horrendous. This experience has not produced a common generational outlook. No such thing ever exists. But it is producing a distinct intragenerational argument, one that does not respect the ideological boundaries to which Americans have become accustomed. The Millennials are unlikely to play out their political conflicts between the yard lines Reagan and Clinton set out.\n\nIn 2001, just as the first Millennials were entering the workforce, the United States fell into recession. By 2007 the unemployment rate had still not returned to its pre-recession level. Then the financial crisis hit. By 2012, data showed how economically bleak the Millennials\u2019 first decade of adulthood had been. Between 1989 and 2000, when younger members of the Reagan-Clinton generation were entering the job market, inflation-adjusted wages for recent college graduates rose almost 11 percent, and wages for recent high school graduates rose 12 percent. Between 2000 and 2012, it was the reverse. Inflation-adjusted wages dropped 13 percent among recent high school graduates and 8 percent among recent graduates of college.\n\n\n\nBut it was worse than that. If Millennials were victims of a 21st-century downward slide in wages, they were also victims of a longer-term downward slide in benefits. The percentage of recent college graduates with employer-provided health care, for instance, dropped by half between 1989 and 2011.\n\nGetty Images Christine Quinn and Hillary Clinton meet in Manhattan.\n\nThe Great Recession hurt older Americans, too. But because they were more likely to already have secured some foothold in the job market, they were more cushioned from the blow. By 2009, the net worth of households headed by someone over 65 was 47 times the net worth of households headed by someone under 35, almost five times the margin that existed in 1984.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason\n\nOne reason is that in addition to coming of age in a terrible economy, Millennials have come of age at a time when the government safety net is far more threadbare for the young than for the middle-aged and old. As the Economic Policy Institute has pointed out, younger Americans are less likely than their elders to qualify for unemployment insurance, food stamps, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or the Earned Income Tax Credit. (Not to mention Medicare and Social Security.)\n\nMillennials have also borne the brunt of declines in government spending on higher education. In 2012, according to The New York Times, state and local spending per college student hit a 25-year low. As government has cut back, universities have passed on the (ever-increasing) costs of college to students. Nationally, the share of households owing student debt doubled between 1989 and 2010, and the average amount of debt per household tripled, to $26,000.\n\nEconomic hardship has not always pushed Americans to the left. In the Clinton-Reagan era, for instance, the right often used culture and foreign policy to convince economically struggling Americans to vote against bigger government. But a mountain of survey data\u2014plus the heavily Democratic tilt of Millennials in every national election in which they have voted\u2014suggests that they are less susceptible to these right-wing populist appeals. For one thing, right-wing populism generally requires rousing white, Christian, straight, native-born Americans against Americans who are not all those things. But among Millennials, there are fewer white, Christian non-immigrants to rouse. Forty percent of Millennials are racial or ethnic minorities. Less than half say religion is \u201cvery important\u201d to their lives.\n\nAnd even those Millennials who are white, Christian, straight, and native-born are less resentful of people who are not. According to a 2010 Pew survey, whites under the age of 30 were more than 50 points more likely than whites over 65 to say they were comfortable with someone in their family marrying someone of another ethnicity or race. A 2011 poll by the Public Religion Research Institute found that almost 50 percent of evangelicals under the age of 30 back gay marriage.\n\nOf course, new racial, ethnic, and sexual fault lines could emerge. But today, a Republican seeking to divert Millennial frustrations in a conservative cultural direction must reckon with the fact that Millennials are dramatically more liberal than the elderly and substantially more liberal than the Reagan-Clinton generation on every major culture war issue except abortion (where there is no significant generational divide).\n\nThey are also more dovish on foreign policy. According to the Pew Research Center, Millennials are close to half as likely as the Reagan-Clinton generation to accept sacrificing civil liberties in the fight against terrorism and much less likely to say the best way to fight terrorism is through military force.\n\nAndrew Burton/Getty Images A protester carries a flag at Occupy Wall Street.\n\nIt is these two factors\u2014their economic hardship in an age of limited government protection and their resistance to right-wing cultural populism\u2014that best explain why on economic issues, Millennials lean so far left. In 2010, Pew found that two-thirds of Millennials favored a bigger government with more services over a cheaper one with fewer services, a margin 25 points above the rest of the population. While large majorities of older and middle-aged Americans favored repealing Obamacare in late 2012, Millennials favored expanding it, by 17 points. Millennials are substantially more pro\u2013labor union than the population at large.\n\nThe only economic issue on which Millennials show much libertarian instinct is the privatization of Social Security, which they disproportionately favor. But this may be less significant than it first appears. Historically, younger voters have long been more pro\u2013Social Security privatization than older ones, with support dropping as they near retirement age. In fact, when asked if the government should spend more money on Social Security, Millennials are significantly more likely than past cohorts of young people to say yes.\n\nMost striking of all, Millennials are more willing than their elders to challenge cherished American myths about capitalism and class. According to a 2011 Pew study, Americans under 30 are the only segment of the population to describe themselves as \u201chave nots\u201d rather than \u201chaves.\u201d They are far more likely than older Americans to say that business enjoys more control over their lives than government. And unlike older Americans, who favor capitalism over socialism by roughly 25 points, Millennials, narrowly, favor socialism.\n\nThere is more reason to believe these attitudes will persist as Millennials age than to believe they will change. For starters, the liberalism of Millennials cannot be explained merely by the fact that they are young, because young Americans have not always been liberal. In recent years, polls have shown young Americans to be the segment of the population most supportive of government-run health care. But in 1978, they were the least supportive. In the last two elections, young Americans voted heavily for Obama. But in 1984 and 1988, Americans under 30 voted Republican for president.\n\nGetty\n\nNor is it true that Americans necessarily grow more conservative as they age. Sometimes they do. But academic studies suggest that party identification, once forged in young adulthood, is more likely to persist than to change. There\u2019s also strong evidence from a 2009 National Bureau of Economic Research paper that people who experience a recession in their plastic years support a larger state role in the economy throughout their lives.\n\nThe economic circumstances that have pushed Millennials left are also unlikely to change dramatically anytime soon. A 2010 study by Yale economist Lisa Kahn found that even 17 years later, people who had entered the workforce during a recession still earned 10 percent less than those who entered when the economy was strong. In other words, even if the economy booms tomorrow, Millennials will still be suffering the Great Recession\u2019s aftershocks for decades.\n\nAnd the economy is not likely to boom. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke doesn\u2019t believe the unemployment rate will reach 6 percent until 2016, and even that will be higher than the 1990s average. Nor are the government protections Millennials crave likely to appear anytime soon. To the contrary, as a result of the spending cuts signed into law in 2010 and the sequester that began this year, non-defense discretionary spending is set to decline by decade\u2019s end to its lowest level in 50 years.\n\nIf Millennials remain on the left, the consequences for American politics over the next two decades could be profound. In the 2008 presidential election, Millennials constituted one-fifth of America\u2019s voters. In 2012, they were one-quarter. In 2016, according to predictions by political demographer Ruy Teixeira, they will be one-third. And they will go on constituting between one-third and two-fifths of America\u2019s voters through at least 2028.\n\nThis rise will challenge each party, but in different ways. In the runup to 2016, the media will likely feature stories about how 40-something Republicans like Marco Rubio, who blasts Snoop Dog from his car, or Paul Ryan, who enjoys Rage Against the Machine, may appeal to Millennials in ways that geezers like McCain and Romney did not. Don\u2019t believe it. According to a 2012 Harvard survey, young Americans were more than twice as likely to say Mitt Romney\u2019s selection of Ryan made them feel more negative about the ticket than more positive. In his 2010 Senate race, Rubio fared worse among young voters than any other age group. The same goes for Rand Paul in his Senate race that year in Kentucky, and Scott Walker in his 2010 race for governor of Wisconsin and his recall battle in 2012.\n\nPre-election polls in Ted Cruz\u2019s 2012 senate race in Texas (there were no exit polls) also showed him faring worst among the young.\n\nThe likeliest explanation for this is that while younger Republican candidates may have a greater cultural connection to young voters, the ideological gulf is vast. Even if they are only a decade older than Millennials, politicians like Cruz, Rubio, and Walker hail from a different political generation both because they came of age at a time of relative prosperity and because they were shaped by Reagan, whom Millennials don\u2019t remember. In fact, the militantly anti-government vision espoused by ultra-Reaganites like Cruz, Rubio, and Walker isn\u2019t even that popular among Millennial Republicans. As a July Pew survey notes, Republicans under 30 are more hostile to the Tea Party than any other Republican age group. By double digits, they\u2019re also more likely than other Republicans to support increasing the minimum wage.\n\nRepublicans may modestly increase their standing among young voters by becoming more tolerant on cultural issues and less hawkish on foreign policy, but it\u2019s unlikely they will become truly competitive unless they follow the counsel of conservative commentators Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam and \u201cadapt to a new reality\u2014namely, that today, Americans are increasingly worried about their economic security.\u201d If there\u2019s hope for the GOP, it\u2019s that Millennials, while hungry for government to provide them that economic security, are also distrustful of its capacity to do so. As a result of growing up in what Chris Hayes\u2019 has called the \u201cfail decade\u201d \u2014the decade of the Iraq War, Hurricane Katrina and the financial crisis\u2014Millennials are even more cynical about government than the past generations of young Americans who wanted less from it. If a Republican presidential candidate could match his Democratic opponent as a champion of economic security and yet do so in a way that required less faith in Washington\u2019s competence and benevolence, he might boost the GOP with young voters in a way no number of pop-culture references ever could.\n\nIf the Millennials challenge Reaganite orthodoxy, they will likely challenge Clintonian orthodoxy, too. Over the past three decades, Democratic politicians have grown accustomed to campaigning and governing in the absence of a mobilized left. This absence has weakened them: Unlike Franklin Roosevelt or Lyndon Johnson, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama could never credibly threaten American conservatives that if they didn\u2019t pass liberal reforms, left-wing radicals might disrupt social order. But Democrats of the Reagan-Clinton generation have also grown comfortable with that absence. From Tony Coelho, who during the Reagan years taught House Democrats to raise money from corporate lobbyists to Bill Clinton, who made Goldman Sachs co-chairman Robert Rubin his chief economic adviser, to Barack Obama, who gave the job to Rubin\u2019s former deputy and alter ego, Larry Summers, Democrats have found it easier to forge relationships with the conservative worlds of big business and high finance because they have not faced much countervailing pressure from an independent movement of the left.\n\nBut that may be changing. Look at the forces that created Occupy Wall Street. The men and women who assembled in September 2011 in Zuccotti Park bore three key characteristics. First, they were young. According to a survey published by City University of New York\u2019s Murphy Institute for Worker Education and Labor, 40 percent of the core activists involved taking over the park were under 30 years old. Second, they were highly educated. Eighty percent possessed at least a bachelors\u2019 degree, more than twice the percentage of New Yorkers overall. Third, they were frustrated economically. According to the CUNY study, more than half the Occupy activists under 30 owed at least $1,000 in student debt. More than a one-third had lost a job or been laid off in the previous five years. In the words of David Graeber, the man widely credited with coining the slogan \u201cWe are the 99 percent,\u201d the Occupy activists were \u201cforward-looking people who had been stopped dead in their tracks\u201d by bad economic times.\n\nMonika Graff/Getty Images Occupy Wall Street protesters picket during a May Day rally in front of the Bank of America building in 2012.\n\nFor a moment, Occupy shook the country. At one point in December 2011, Todd Gitlin points out in Occupy Nation, the movement had branches in one-third of the cities and towns in California. Then it collapsed. But as the political scientist Frances Fox Piven has argued, \u201cThe great protest movements of history \u2026 did not expand in the shape of a simple rising arc of popular defiance. Rather, they began in a particular place, sputtered and subsided, only to re-emerge elsewhere in perhaps a different form, influenced by local particularities of circumstance and culture.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to know whether the protest against inequality will be such a movement. But the forces that drove it are unlikely to subside. Many young Americans feel that economic unfairness is costing them a shot at a decent life. Such sentiments have long been widespread among the poor. What\u2019s new is their prevalence among people who saw their parents achieve\u2014and expected for themselves\u2014some measure of prosperity, the people Chris Hayes calls the \u201cnewly radicalized upper-middle class.\u201d\n\nIf history is any guide, the sentiments behind Occupy will find their way into the political process, just as the anti-Vietnam movement helped create Eugene McCarthy\u2019s presidential bid in 1968, and the civil-rights movement bred politicians like Andrew Young, Tom Bradley, and Jesse Jackson. That\u2019s especially likely because Occupy\u2019s message enjoys significant support among the young. A November 2011 Public Policy Polling survey found that while Americans over 30 opposed Occupy\u2019s goals by close to 20 points, Millennials supported them by 12.\n\nBill de Blasio\u2019s mayoral campaign offers a glimpse into what an Occupy-inspired challenge to Clintonism might look like. In important ways, New York politics has mirrored national politics in the Reagan-Clinton era. Since 1978, the mayoralty has been dominated by three men\u2014Ed Koch, Rudy Giuliani, and Michael Bloomberg\u2014who although liberal on many cultural issues have closely identified Wall Street\u2019s interests with the city\u2019s. During their time in office, New York has become far safer, cleaner, more expensive, and more unequal. In Bloomberg\u2019s words, New York is now a \u201chigh-end product.\u201d\n\nCity Council Speaker Christine Quinn, despite her roots on the left as a housing and LGBT activist, became Bloomberg\u2019s heir apparent by stymieing bills that would have required businesses to give their employees paid sick leave and mandated a higher minimum wage for companies that receive government subsidies. Early in the campaign, many commentators considered this a wise strategy and anticipated that as New York\u2019s first lesbian mayor, Quinn would symbolize the city\u2019s unprecedented cultural tolerance while continuing its Clintonian economic policies.\n\nThen strange things happened. First, Anthony Weiner entered the race and snatched support from Quinn before exploding in a blaze of late-night comedy. But when Weiner crashed, his support went not back to Quinn but to de Blasio, the candidate who most bluntly challenged Bloomberg\u2019s economic philosophy. Calling it \u201can act of equalization in a city that is desperately falling into the habit of disparity,\u201d de Blasio made his central proposal a tax on people making over $500,000 to fund universal childcare. He also called for requiring developers to build more affordable housing and ending the New York Police Department\u2019s \u201cstop and frisk\u201d policies that had angered many African-Americans and Latinos. Bloomberg\u2019s deputy mayor Howard Wolfson tweeted that de Blasio\u2019s \u201cagenda is clear: higher taxes, bigger govt, more biz mandates. A u-turn back to the 70s.\u201d\n\nBut in truth, it was Wolfson who was out of date: Fewer and fewer New Yorkers remember the 1970s, when economic stagnation, rising crime, and bloated government helped elect both Ed Koch and Ronald Reagan. What concerns them more today is that, as The New Yorker recently noted, \u201cIf the borough of Manhattan were a country, the income gap between the richest twenty per cent and the poorest twenty per cent would be on par with countries like Sierra Leone, Namibia, and Lesotho.\u201d In Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primary, Quinn defeated de Blasio in those parts of New York where average income tops $175,000 per year. But he beat her by 25 points overall.\n\nDemocrats in New York are more liberal than Democrats nationally. Still, the right presidential candidate, following de Blasio\u2019s model, could seriously challenge Hillary Clinton. If that sounds far-fetched, consider the last two Democratic presidential primary campaigns. In October 2002, Howard Dean was so obscure that at a Jefferson-Jackson Day dinner, Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin repeatedly referred to him as \u201cJohn.\u201d But in the summer of 2003, running against the Iraq War amidst a field of Washington Democrats who had voted to authorize it, Dean caught fire. In the first quarter of the year he raised just under $3 million, less than one-third of John Kerry\u2019s total. In the second quarter, he shocked insiders by beating Kerry and raising over $7 million. In the third quarter, he raised almost $15 million, far more than any Democrat ever had. By November, Harkin, Al Gore, and the nation\u2019s two most powerful labor unions had endorsed Dean and he was well ahead in the Iowa polls.\n\nAt the last minute, Dean flamed out, undone by harsh attacks from his rivals and his campaign\u2019s lack of discipline. Still, he established a template for toppling a Democratic frontrunner: inspire young voters, raise vast funds via small donations over the Web, and attack those elements of Clintonian orthodoxy that are accepted by Democratic elites but loathed by liberal activists on the ground.\n\nIn 2008, that became the template for Barack Obama. As late as October 2007, Hillary enjoyed a 33-point lead in national polls. But Obama made her support for the Iraq War a symbol of her alleged timidity in challenging the right-leaning consensus in Washington. As liberals began to see him as embodying the historic change they sought, Obama started raising ungodly amounts via small donors over the Internet, which in turned won him credibility with insiders in Washington. He overwhelmed Hillary Clinton in caucus states, where liberal activists wield greater power. And he overwhelmed her among younger voters. In the 2008 Iowa caucuses, youth turnout rose 30 percent and among voters under the age of 30, Obama beat Hillary by 46 points.\n\nHillary starts the 2016 race with formidable strengths. After a widely applauded term as secretary of state, her approval rating is 10 points higher than it was when she began running in 2008. Her vote to authorize Iraq will be less of a liability this time. Her campaign cannot possibly be as poorly managed. And she won\u2019t have to run against Barack Obama.\n\nStill, Hillary is vulnerable to a candidate who can inspire passion and embody fundamental change, especially on the subject of economic inequality and corporate power, a subject with deep resonance among Millennial Democrats. And the candidate who best fits that description is Elizabeth Warren.\n\nKarl Walter/Getty Images A crowd watches Azealia Banks onstage during the Coachella Festival.\n\nFirst, as a woman, Warren would drain the deepest reservoir of pro-Hillary passion: the prospect of a female president. While Hillary would raise vast sums, Dean and Obama have both shown that in the digital age, an insurgent can compete financially by inspiring huge numbers of small donations. Elizabeth Warren can do that. She\u2019s already shown a knack for going viral. A video of her first Senate banking committee hearing, where she scolded regulators that \u201ctoo-big-to-fail has become too-big-for-trial,\u201d garnered 1 million hits on YouTube. In her 2012 Senate race, despite never before having sought elected office, she raised $42 million, more than twice as much as the second-highest-raising Democrat. After Bill Clinton and the Obamas, no other speaker at last summer\u2019s Democratic convention so electrified the crowd.\n\nWarren has done it by challenging corporate power with an intensity Clinton Democrats rarely muster. At the convention, she attacked the \u201cWall Street CEOs\u2014the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs\u2014[who] still strut around Congress, no shame, demanding favors, and acting like we should thank them.\u201d\n\nAnd in one of the biggest applause lines of the entire convention, taken straight from Occupy, she thundered that \u201cwe don\u2019t run this country for corporations, we run it for people.\u201d\n\n\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled by Warren\u2019s advanced age. If she runs, Millennials will be her base. No candidate is as well positioned to appeal to the young and economically insecure. Warren won her Senate race by eight points overall, but by 30 points among the young. The first bill she introduced in the Senate was a proposal to charge college students the same interest rates for their loans that the Federal Reserve offers big banks. It soon garnered 100,000 hits on YouTube.\n\nA big reason Warren\u2019s speech went viral was its promotion by Upworthy, a website dedicated to publicizing progressive narratives. And that speaks to another, underappreciated, advantage Warren would enjoy. Clinton Democrats once boasted a potent intellectual and media infrastructure. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the Democratic Leadership Council and its think tank, the Progressive Policy Institute, were the Democratic Party\u2019s hottest ideas shops, and they dedicated themselves to restoring the party\u2019s reputation as business-friendly. Influential New Democratic\u2013aligned magazines like The New Republic and Washington Monthly also championed the cause.\n\nToday, that New Democratic infrastructure barely exists. The DLC has closed down. The New Republic and Washington Monthly have moved left. And all the new powerhouses of the liberal media\u2014from Paul Krugman (who was radicalized during the Bush years) to Jon Stewart (who took over The Daily Show in 1999) to MSNBC (which as late as 2008 still carried a show hosted by Tucker Carlson)\u2014believe the Democrats are too soft on Wall Street.\n\nYou can see that shift in the race for governor of the Federal Reserve, where the liberal media has rallied behind Janet Yellen and against the more Wall Street\u2013identified Larry Summers. In the age of MSNBC, populist Democrats enjoy a media echo chamber that gives them an advantage over pro-business Democrats that did not exist a decade ago. And if Clinton, who liberal pundits respect, runs against Warren, who liberal pundits revere, that echo chamber will benefit Warren.", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "peterbeinart"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201309120845, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "Bill de Blasio\u2019s win in New York\u2019s Democratic primary isn\u2019t a local story.
