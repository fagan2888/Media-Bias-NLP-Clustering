It\u2019s a time to celebrate the countless contributions that Hispanics have made to this great country for generations. It\u2019s a time to celebrate Latino history and Americans\u2019 shared future.\n\nBut I also want to take this moment to say a word \u2014 to send an open letter, if you like \u2014 to my fellow Republicans, including candidates and officeholders at every level, from the courthouse to Capitol Hill: If you\u2019re not engaging with the Hispanic community, you better get to work.\n\nHispanics are the fastest-growing demographic group in America. In the past decade they accounted for more than half of the nation\u2019s population growth, according to Pew Hispanic. No party can fully represent the American people if it doesn\u2019t build relationships with the Hispanic community. That\u2019s why the RNC has made an unprecedented investment in building a long-term year-round presence in Latino communities across the country. We\u2019re going where people live, work, and worship. We\u2019ll be at community events and swearing-in ceremonies, sharing our positive vision for America but, more importantly, listening to Hispanics\u2019 concerns and cares.\n\nThis infrastructure is important. But individual candidates must do their part too. Hispanics deserve candidates and a party that will fight for their vote. In working to earn Hispanics\u2019 trust, though, Republicans have to remember that it\u2019s not just about what we say, but how we say it. Our principles are sound, but we have to be thoughtful in how we discuss them. Too often, a candidate\u2019s tone can turn off voters, promote divisiveness, and feed mischaracterizations of our party. So if your tone isn\u2019t welcoming and inclusive, you\u2019re doing it wrong.\n\nAlso, any engagement effort has a media component, and Republicans must engage with Hispanic journalists. If I can speak with Jorge Ramos and Jos\u00e9 Diaz-Balart about the future of the party, so can everyone else. Juntos podemos hacer m\u00e1s \u2014 together we can do more.\n\nBut let\u2019s be clear: This isn\u2019t just about vote tallies. Putting electoral politics aside for a moment, let\u2019s recognize that Democrats are doing a disservice to our fellow Americans. When we don\u2019t fight for the Latino vote, two things happen. Some Hispanics sit out elections, which was the case in the last election, or Democrats take their votes for granted. As a result, we miss opportunities, and Democrats feel free to prioritize the demands of moneyed special interests over the interests of individuals and families.\n\nSome Hispanics are sadly stuck in failing schools. But do Democrats stand up and say those kids deserve a shot at attending another school? No, they systematically oppose school choice at every turn, doing the bidding of the teachers\u2019 unions. Republicans believe it shouldn\u2019t matter whether the schools children attend are traditional public schools, charter schools, or private schools. It matters only that they attend good schools.\n\nHispanics also face a higher unemployment rate than the national average. But do Democrats stand up and concede that government spending hasn\u2019t solved the problem? No, Democrats think that if we mortgage our children\u2019s future, jobs will magically appear in the private sector. But the proof is in the pudding: The president\u2019s spending binge hasn\u2019t helped Latinos. Republicans believe it\u2019s not the government\u2019s responsibility to pay for jobs that are created but rather to ensure a business-friendly environment that allows for job creation.\n\nBefore the recession, Hispanics were starting businesses faster than any other ethnic group, according to the Kauffman Foundation. But do Democrats ever stand up and admit that Obamacare is hurting small and medium-sized businesses with added expenses? Do Democrats not watch Telemundo and listen to the stories of business owners forced to decide between laying off workers or closing their doors for good? Do they recognize that their law is cutting workers\u2019 hours and crushing the dreams of Latinos who want to grow their family companies? Republicans believe that real health-care reform should lower costs, protect access, and not sacrifice jobs.\n\nIn 2014 we\u2019re going to hold accountable vulnerable Democrats like Ron Barber, Raul Ruiz, Joe Garcia, Pete Gallego, and Patrick Murphy, to mention a few, who have failed their constituents, a significant number of whom are Hispanic. And in the long term \u2014 2016 and beyond \u2014 the same will go for Democrats all across the country.\n\nSo, my fellow Republicans, it\u2019s up to us to keep Democrats from taking Hispanic voters for granted. It\u2019s up to Republicans to tell our story and offer a better way. And it\u2019s up to every one of us to engage with Hispanic voters.
