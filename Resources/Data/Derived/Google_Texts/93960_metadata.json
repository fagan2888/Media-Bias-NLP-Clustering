Indeed, Sanders has continued to force Hillary Clinton to tack to the left on multiple issues, and he has had a genuinely transformative impact on the national political discourse by unashamedly bringing democratic socialism to the stage.\n\nThis is why Harold Meyerson argues that the Sanders\u2019s campaign represents \u201cthe largest specifically left mobilization\u2014and by \u2018specifically left\u2019 I mean it demands major changes in the distribution of income and wealth and major reforms to U.S. capitalism\u2014that the nation has seen in at least half a century.\u201d\n\nLast week, Sanders himself defined what such a movement should be based on in a speech in which he defined his version of \u201cDemocratic Socialism\u201d by linking his political vision to FDR\u2019s Second Bill of Rights and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s proposition that \u201ctrue freedom does not occur without economic security\u201d:\n\nIf we are serious about transforming our country, if we are serious about rebuilding the middle class, if we are serious about reinvigorating our democracy, we need to develop a political movement which, once again, is prepared to take on and defeat a ruling class whose greed is destroying our nation. The billionaire class cannot have it all. Our government belongs to all of us, and not just the one percent.\n\nWe need to create a culture which, as Pope Francis reminds us, cannot just be based on the worship of money. We must not accept a nation in which billionaires compete as to the size of their super-yachts while children in America go hungry and veterans sleep out on the streets.\n\nWhile this might be inspiring to progressives yearning for a real opposition party not wedded to the same old neoliberal policies that the national Democratic Party has frequently promoted since the inception of the Clinton era, there are plenty of people on the other side of this intraparty divide who are far from sanguine about the new populism.\n\nAs Richard (RJ) Escrow reports in \u201cThe New Democrats Meet the New Reality\u201d in the Huffington Post, the corporate Democrats are not just worried about the impact of Sanders\u2019s populism, they are actively seeking to undermine it:\n\nNow they\u2019re fighting back. A Wall Street-funded Democratic think tank called Third Way has released a lengthy report which argues that an inequality-based, populist theme will doom Democrats. Its board member, former White House Chief of Staff (and JPMorgan Chase executive) Bill Daley, even insisted to HuffPost\u2019s Stein that Sanders\u2019 political positions are \u201ca recipe for disaster.\u201d\n\nThe Third Way report is available online. It introduces a number of catchphrases, often paired in threes: the Hopscotch Workforce, the Nickel-and-Dimed Workforce, and the Asset-Starved Workforce; Stalling Schools, the College Well, and Adult Atrophy; the Upside-Down Economy, the Anywhere Economy, and the Malnourished Economy.\n\nSadly, most of the content amounts to Misleading Minutiae, Gimmicky Wordplay, and Downright Deception . . .\n\nThird Way\u2019s argument against inequality as a leading source of our current economic woes puts them directly at odds with leading economists, including Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz. \u201cPoliticians typically talk about rising inequality and the sluggish recovery as separate phenomena,\u201d Stiglitz wrote in 2013, \u201cwhen they are in fact intertwined. Inequality stifles, restrains and holds back our growth.\u201d\n\nSo while the largely superficial coverage of the presidential race in the national corporate media will continue to focus on horserace and personality politics, anyone who knows the recent history of the Democratic Party understands that the Sanders campaign represents the deepest progressive challenge to the neoliberal direction of the party since the formation of the Democratic Leadership Council that helped bring us Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cThird Way\u201d presidency and the Democratic Party establishment\u2019s embrace of market-driven policy decades ago.\n\nThat\u2019s why a Wall Street-funded Democratic think tank is taking cheap shots at the Sanders campaign. It\u2019s the fear of a real progressive leader asking the troubling questions about our economy and the distribution of wealth that Clinton will never push too far.\n\nInstead, this last week the neoliberal camp has started pushing in the other direction as the Huffington post reports in \u201cHillary Clinton Attacks Sanders\u2019 Progressive Agenda,\u201d Clinton proxies have taken a page out of the Republican playbook and gone after Sanders on taxes:\n\n[T]he Clinton campaign has made a conscious decision here. It is not merely criticizing Sanders for suspicious math. It is suggesting the test for any proposed initiative is what taxes it imposes, regardless of what benefits it might bring.\n\nThis is the kind of argument that conservatives make. It might or might not help Clinton win in November. It\u2019s hard to see how it can help progressives win in the long run.\n\nThus, however much Hillary Clinton positions herself to the left tactically, there should be no illusions about the real direction of her economic policies, which, if history is our guide, will continue to be thoroughly neoliberal with the same kinds of small ball nods to working people and progressives (mostly on social issues) that we got from the first Clinton administration.\n\nThe Wrecking Crew, Part II\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the corporate Democrats who can\u2019t think past the nineties. On the other side of the aisle, the Clinton-obsessed Republicans are salivating to get back to the good old days as well.\n\nYes, as Bloomberg recently reported, the new hard-right House Freedom Caucus is looking to bring back the Contract with America:\n\nMembers of the House Freedom Caucus are preparing a \u201cContract With America II\u201d that would call for House votes in the first 100 days of 2016 on replacing Obamacare, overhauling entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and repealing the estate tax.\n\nAn early draft of the plan obtained by Bloomberg News also calls for legislation to slash government regulations by 20 percent, cut corporate tax rates and expand offshore oil drilling. Efforts are still under way to finalize contents of the \u201ccontract,\u201d which lawmakers say they hope will become the basis of House Republicans\u2019 2016 agenda . . .\n\nThe draft of the Freedom Caucus contract calls for House floor votes on proposals to require a balanced federal budget, repeal the estate tax, replace Obamacare, and cut dependence on foreign oil 20 percent by 2025. The military should receive enough funding to be able to fight two separate wars in different parts of the world, it says, and government regulations should be cut 20 percent across the board.\n\nThe proposal calls for closing corporate tax \u201cloopholes\u201d and cutting the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent; banning federal funds for Planned Parenthood and other groups that perform abortions; overhauling entitlement programs and enacting measures \u201cto promote workfare, not welfare.\u201d\n\nSo just as the corporatists in the Third Way want to make sure that the era of \u201cbig government\u201d stays gone in Democratic circles, the folks on the hard right are working diligently to drown it in a bathtub as they continue to lavish gifts on the plutocrats and drill us toward the end of the world.\n\nIf all the terribly serious people are correct and Clinton wins the White House but the Republicans hold Congress, we may just get to go back to the nineties after all and watch the New Democrats save us by triangulating with the hard right.\n\nI think I\u2019ve seen this movie before and it doesn\u2019t end well, but at least I don\u2019t live in Denmark.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://sandiegofreepress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/dem-socialism.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Wrecking Crew, Part IIBut it\u2019s not just the corporate Democrats who can\u2019t think past the nineties.\nA Wall Street-funded Democratic think tank called Third Way has released a lengthy report which argues that an inequality-based, populist theme will doom Democrats.\nAs Richard (RJ) Escrow reports in \u201cThe New Democrats Meet the New Reality\u201d in the Huffington Post, the corporate Democrats are not just worried about the impact of Sanders\u2019s populism, they are actively seeking to undermine it:Now they\u2019re fighting back.\nThat\u2019s why a Wall Street-funded Democratic think tank is taking cheap shots at the Sanders campaign.\nInstead, this last week the neoliberal camp has started pushing in the other direction as the Huffington post reports in \u201cHillary Clinton Attacks Sanders\u2019 Progressive Agenda,\u201d Clinton proxies have taken a page out of the Republican playbook and gone after Sanders on taxes:[T]he Clinton campaign has made a conscious decision here."}
