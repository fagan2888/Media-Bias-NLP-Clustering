Pitman\n\nStaff Writer\n\nOhio will join 37 other state Monday when it begins allowing motorists to show digital copies of their proof of auto insurance to law enforcement.\n\nDrivers will be able to show law enforcement officers their proof of financial responsibility via a cellphone, laptop, tablet or other some other electronic wireless device.\n\nE-insurance cards are part of a continuing trend for states to update and upgrade their insurance laws.\n\nSen. Edna Brown, D-Toledo, was the bill\u2019s primary sponsor. In a statement after the bill passed in the Senate last summer, Brown said it \u201cembraces new technology in a positive way.\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the Ohio Telecom Association, half of all wireless customers in Ohio carry a smartphone,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile printed insurance cards are still valid, this additional electronic option follows Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles compliance standards and provides additional convenience for Ohio drivers.\u201d\n\nGov. John Kasich signed the bill into law this past December, and the new e-card proof can also be shown when motorists renew their license or for court appearances.\n\nWhile 38 states, as of Monday, will permit showing proof of insurance via digital means, the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America indicates that in 2011 no law existed permitting drivers to use their cellphones to show proof of insurance.\n\nPortman\u2019s Obamacare anniversary comments\n\nThe controversial Affordable Healthcare Act that was signed into law five years ago this Monday, prompted Ohio\u2019s junior senator to reflect on the bill, and calling for its repeal and replacement with a \u201cpatient-centered and consumer-driven that decreases costs and increases access to quality care.\u201d\n\nSen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said after five years, \u201cit\u2019s abundantly clear that this law isn\u2019t working,\u201d and it can\u2019t be fixed \u201cthrough ad hoc executive orders and administrative actions.\u201d\n\n\u201cObamacare continues to make insurance more expensive and jobs harder to find,\u201d he said. \u201cMillions of Americans have lost their health insurance or their doctor, and millions more have seen their premiums and deductibles skyrocket.\u201d\n\nPortman said the controversy \u201cis the predictable result of forcing a partisan piece of legislation through Congress without amendments, proper consideration, or bipartisan input.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio will join 37 other state Monday when it begins allowing motorists to show digital copies of their proof of auto insurance to law enforcement.", "og": {"url": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/ohio-joins-37-other-states-with-digital-proof-of-i/nkbX7/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/08/21/53/5b/JN_Facebook_Icon.png", "type": "article", "description": "Ohio will join 37 other state Monday when it begins allowing motorists to show digital copies of their proof of auto insurance to law enforcement.", "title": "Ohio joins 37 other states with digital proof of insurance law"}, "twitter": {"site": "@journalnews", "description": "Ohio will join 37 other state Monday when it begins allowing motorists to show digital copies of their proof of auto insurance to law enforcement.", "card": "summary", "title": "Ohio joins 37 other states with digital proof of insurance law"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "journal-news", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.journal-news.com/news/news/ohio-joins-37-other-states-with-digital-proof-of-i/nkbX7/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/2848244/news/news/ohio-joins-37-other-states-with-digital-proof-of-i/nkbX7/", "keywords": "Butler County,politics,HJNhomepage", "google-site-verification": "4Q9_13tOch6eLcVYCHatUepAlnmJQbgHMCB16qdjcy0", "news_keywords": "Butler County, politics, HJNhomepage"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9e60\"", "article_summary": "By Michael D.
