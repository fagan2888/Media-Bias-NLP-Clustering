ASQ is best known as the sole administrator of the annual Malcolm Baldrige National quality Award; the association encompasses 90,000 members worldwide.\n\nAmong the 323 quality professionals in healthcare surveyed, when asked what things were \u201cextremely important\u201d to do right now in healthcare, 42.9 percent cited \u201creducing hospital readmissions\u201d; 34.52 percent cited \u201ccreating efficiencies with existing clinical resources (staff and units) to maximize patient throughput\u201d; 30.45 percent cited \u201cimplementing patient care coordination programs\u201d; 30.0 percent, \u201cchanging medical malpractice laws\u201d; 23.2 percent cited \u201cimproving data and analytics on ROI of medical products/technologies\u201d; 21.29 percent, \u201cimproving supply chain management\u201d; and 21.22 percent, \u201credesigning hospital care spaces to be more efficient.\u201d\n\nWhen asked to name quality improvement approaches that would \u201chelp healthcare organizations to cut costs and reduce waste,\u201d survey respondents cited \u201cincreasing the use of quality and process engineers in healthcare settings\u201d (29.68 percent); \u201cfocusing on Lean management principles\u201d (29.68 percent); \u201cimplementing mandatory process improvement training for healthcare professionals\u201d (29.22 percent); \u201ccreating financial incentives to deliver more efficient care\u201d (27.12 percent); \u201cforming or joining purchasing collaboratives and group purchasing organizations to leverage their buying power,\u201d 19.14 percent; and \u201cexpanding the use of \u2018medical technology\u2019 (refers to procedures, equipment, and processes by which medical care is delivered),\u201d 17.43 percent.\n\nMeanwhile, when asked to name difficult \u201churdles that healthcare organizations face in making changes to reduce costs,\u201d 48.44 percent of those surveyed cited \u201cThe Affordable Care Act and its impact on how healthcare organizations set prices\u201d; 26.14 percent cited \u201cMedicare and Medicaid funding challenges\u201d; 20.78 percent said, \u201cmodifying the model of reimbursement so healthcare and health maintenance is preferred over the sick-care, fee-for-service model that currently exists\u201d; 16.29 percent said \u201clower reimbursement from health insurance exchanges\u201d; 14.56 percent cited \u201cfragmented, uncoordinated care\u201d; 13.2 percent mentioned \u201cpersuading physicians to accept changes to the types of devices or supplies being purchased; while only 5.94 percent cited \u201cnot enough organizational bandwidth or resources.\u201d\n\nShortly after the release of the survey results, Joseph M. Fortuna, M.D., spoke with HCI Editor-in-Chief Mark Hagland about the survey and about broader issues in healthcare quality improvement. Dr. Fortuna, the immediate past chair of the healthcare division of ASQ, is the CEO of PRISM, a Milwaukee-based non-profit consulting group working with hospitals and medical groups, to bring process and quality improvement skills, methodologies, attitudes. Dr. Fortuna practiced for years as an emergency physician, before transitioning into work as a corporate medical director, and then consulting work. Below are excerpts from that interview.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about your perspectives on the intersection between quality and healthcare delivery and operations.\n\nYes. What healthcare people don\u2019t realize very often is that quality in healthcare has many domains. And certainly, many clinicians see it only in the clinical domain. But to really be a high-performing organization, you\u2019ve got to look at the operational domain as well. Most of the errors occur in the operational realm and in support systems. And the culture in healthcare has not progressed to where Toyota is, except in a few organizations like Virginia Mason, to where everyone is looking to eliminate waste. And we\u2019re mostly not doing that in healthcare. And those who are mostly don\u2019t have the high-level skills needed to do that enterprise-wide and to make it a sustainable part of their culture. We don\u2019t do that, and that\u2019s what our organization, ASQ, is really passionate about.\n\n\n\nJoseph Fortuna, M.D.\n\n\n\nAmong the survey results, it was notable that nearly one-third of ASQ members surveyed urged the hiring of professional quality and process engineers in healthcare settings.\n\nI am very passionate about this issue. Many hospital leaders, including both administrators and clinicians, favor training clinicians in quality courses and then employing them as quality and process change leaders. And if you look at advertisements placed in media for people in healthcare, for quality directors, they\u2019re almost always mandating a clinical background. Frankly, for my money, unless somebody is a process engineer first and then goes into clinical practice, those clinicians generally don\u2019t have anywhere near the level of skill sets that process engineers have. Someone who takes a two-week course in Six Sigma and gets a green belt\u2014that person doesn\u2019t have the skill set needed to really create and sustain change.\n\nSo we really need professional-level process engineers working in hospitals and medical groups, then?\n\nAbsolutely; in fact, we\u2019re developing a white paper on that subject right now.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fceffe\"", "article_summary": "The survey of 323 quality professionals in healthcare was conducted by the Milwaukee-based ASQ, a global association of quality improvement professionals that works to support quality improvement across all industries .\nThe results of a nationwide survey of quality improvement professionals working in healthcare were released July 30, and underscore concerns among those professionals that the obstacles to dramatic quality improvement in healthcare delivery and operational processes are such that major changes need to be made to the ways in which quality improvement is executed in healthcare settings.\nAmong the survey results, it was notable that nearly one-third of ASQ members surveyed urged the hiring of professional quality and process engineers in healthcare settings.\nWhat healthcare people don\u2019t realize very often is that quality in healthcare has many domains.\nMany hospital leaders, including both administrators and clinicians, favor training clinicians in quality courses and then employing them as quality and process change leaders."}
