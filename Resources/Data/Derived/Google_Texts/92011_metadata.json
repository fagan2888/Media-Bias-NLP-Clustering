Those speakers will blast varying energy at the vehicle using a specific pre-programmed algorithm.\n\nIn this case, Lockheed Martin wants to see whether the method will accurately mimic the sound pressure that Orion will experience during launch, ascent and descent back to Earth.\n\n\u201cIf the method proves to be an accurate representation of (NASA\u2019s Space Launch System rocket) launch and ascent acoustic loads, it will be used to evaluate and verify Orion\u2019s ability to withstand those loads during its next mission, Exploration Mission-1,\u201d a release from Lockheed Martin says.\n\nWhile in Littleton, the Orion crew module will also undergo a final decontamination and further post-flight analysis that should conclude next year.\n\nLockheed Martin is Orion\u2019s prime contractor, and about 1,000 employees throughout several of Space Systems\u2019 locations have fingerprints on some aspect of the project, with just under 800 of them in Littleton.\n\nOrion blasted off aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket Dec. 6 on its Experimental Flight Test-1, an uncrewed 4-hour, 24-minute journey more than 3,600 miles into space.\n\nNASA intends Orion to be the spacecraft that takes the first humans to Mars. Orion\u2019s next flight, the uncrewed Experimental Mission-1, will be in 2018 on NASA\u2019s new SLS rocket, which will surpass the Delta IV Heavy as the most powerful launch vehicle in existence.\n\nLaura Keeney: 303-954-1337, lkeeney@denverpost.com or twitter.com/LauraKeeney", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Orion crew module to be blasted with sound in Littleton", "title": "Orion crew module to be blasted with sound in Littleton", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/01/orion-crew-module-to-be-blasted-with-sound-in-littleton/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150901__OrionEFT-1_004p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150901__OrionEFT-1_004p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-01T17:48:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T20:26:35+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd88e\"", "article_summary": "While in Littleton, the Orion crew module will also undergo a final decontamination and further post-flight analysis that should conclude next year.\nDFA is a somewhat recently developed method that tests how well structures can withstand various sound pressure fields.\nEnough speakers to fill three tractor-trailers soon will pummel a spaceship in Littleton with powerful sound waves.\nIn this case, Lockheed Martin wants to see whether the method will accurately mimic the sound pressure that Orion will experience during launch, ascent and descent back to Earth.\nLockheed Martin is Orion\u2019s prime contractor, and about 1,000 employees throughout several of Space Systems\u2019 locations have fingerprints on some aspect of the project, with just under 800 of them in Littleton."}
