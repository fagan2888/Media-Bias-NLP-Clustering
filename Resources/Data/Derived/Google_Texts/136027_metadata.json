Sign up here.**\n\nBuzz Cut:\n\n\u2022 Hillary: The more they see her, the less they like her\n\n\u2022 Iraq pleads for U.S. airstrikes\n\n\u2022 Insurers demand more ObamaCare subsidy cash\n\n\u2022 Cantor seeks to leave legacy with McCarthy pick\n\n\u2022 Squishy\n\nHILLARY: THE MORE THEY SEE HER, THE LESS THEY LIKE HER\n\nMost politicians would kill for a 54 percent favorability rating, but for the 2016 Democratic frontrunner the number is a troubling sign. As Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign blitz surrounding her latest book drags on amid gaffes and fudgy facts, her previously stratospheric ratings have begun to slide. A new Gallup poll shows Clinton down a dozen points since leaving her post as secretary of state, with a 5-point drop since February. Partly that is because Clinton\u2019s candidacy is forcing perceptions through a more partisan prism and partly because she is disappointing the massive expectations she and her campaign organization have created for her.\n\n[Senator Lincoln sure had a nice bedroom at the White House - During a speech in Chicago, Hillary Clinton botched the bio of the greatest Illinoisan. \u201cA senator from Illinois ran against a senator from New York\u2026 Just as had happened way back with a senator from Illinois named [Abraham Lincoln] and a senator from New York named [William] Seward.\u201d One would think that for all of the 2016 frontrunner\u2019s experience with Lincolnalia, she would know that Lincoln never served in the Senate.]\n\nForeign affairs - Another big factor is surely the unraveling of the foreign policy she claims to have restored after the failures of the Bush administration. Clinton\u2019s book, which seeks to tie off the many loose ends from her largely unaccomplished tenure as Secretary of State, comes just as the foreign policy she helped craft is going through a series of painful, frightening reversals. The rise of Putinist Russia and the descent of Syria were bad enough, but now the outrage over the effort to placate the Taliban in Afghanistan with an unauthorized prisoner release and the aggressive resurgence of al Qaeda are making matters tougher. And with Clinton refusing to provide her personal notes to the committee investigating wrongdoing before and after the 2012 Islamist raid on a State Department outpost in Benghazi, Libya, one gets the sense that Clinton\u2019s fight over her foreign policy record is ramping up, not winding down.\n\nRand rips Hillary\u2019s Taliban stand - \u201cHillary Clinton is now saying that, \u2018Oh, you know what? The Taliban is not a danger to Americans.\u2019 That\u2019s about as ludicrous of a statement as I\u2019ve heard. But the interesting thing is about one in three of the prisoners that have been released in the past have gone back to committing violence. \u201d \u2013 Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., on \u201cHannity\u201d Wednesday night.\n\nIRAQ PLEADS FOR U.S. AIRSTRIKES\n\nPresident Obama made U.S. disengagement in Iraq a centerpiece of his re-election campaign and even attacked his challenger for saying that a too-speedy withdrawal had destabilized the country. Now, the president is facing pleas from America\u2019s Iraqi allies for help in staving off a rapidly advancing Islamist army that has captured multiple cities American forces suffered heavy casualties in liberating. The al Qaeda- allied forces appear poised for an assault on the capital city of Baghdad, and leaders of the rapidly destabilizing nation are begging for help. WSJ: \u201cIraq has privately signaled to the Obama administration that it would allow the U.S. to conduct airstrikes with drones or manned aircraft against al Qaeda militant targets on Iraqi territory, senior U.S. officials said Wednesday. The Obama administration is considering a number of options, including the possibility of providing \u2018kinetic support\u2019 for the Iraqi military fighting al Qaeda rebels\u2026 according to a senior U.S. official who added that no decisions have been made. Officials declined to say whether the U.S. would consider conducting airstrikes with drones or manned aircraft. Iraq has long asked the U.S. to provide it with drones that could be used in such strikes, but Washington has balked at supplying them, officials said.\u201d\n\nHagel: Sorry, not sorry - \u201cI value the Defense Department\u2019s partnership with this Congress, and the trust we\u2019ve developed over the years. I know that trust has been broken. I know you have questions about that.\u201d \u2013 Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in congressional testimony on the decision by President Obama to disregard a law requiring him to notify Congress about releasing enemy fighters from the prison at Guantanamo Bay. Hagel said, however, that he would do it again.\n\nThe Judge\u2019s ruling - Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano explains the rapid expansion of presidential power: \u201cThe modern presidency is blinded by a conceit that says it can do no wrong. This is partially the result of the passage of power from the states to the feds and from Congress to the president and partially the fault of a president who relishes telling us all how to live.\u201d]\n\nBENGHAZI EXCLUSIVE: CIA LISTENED IN ON ATTACKERS\u2019 CALLS\n\nFox News: \u201cIn an exclusive interview with \u201cSpecial Report with Bret Baier\u201d retired Air Force Maj. Eric Stahl, who served as commander and pilot of the C-17 aircraft that was used to transport the corpses of the four Americans killed in the Benghazi attacks\u2026 said members of a CIA-trained Global Response Staff who raced to the scene of the attacks were \u2018confused\u2019 by the administration\u2019s repeated implication of the video as a trigger for the attacks, because \u201cthey knew during the attack\u2026who was doing the attacking.\u201d Stahl told Baier: \u201cRight after they left the consulate in Benghazi and went to the [CIA] safehouse, they were getting reports that cell phones, consulate cell phones, were being used to make calls to the attackers' higher ups.\u2019\u201d\n\n[Watch Fox: See more from retired Air Force Maj.

That would entice the healthy and the young, the industry says, holding down premiums. So-called catastrophic plans are currently not eligible for the law\u2019s subsidies, and only 2 percent of the 8 million consumers who signed up this year picked one. Subsidies bring down the cost of monthly premiums. The proposed change is part of a package of recommendations that America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the main industry trade group released Wednesday. Others address how to smooth transitions for consumers who switch insurance companies, as well as making it easier for patients to find out which hospitals and doctors are in particular plans and whether their medications are covered\u201d\n\nStudy: Employers scared of ObamaCare costs - Daily Caller: \u201cMost employers expect Obamacare to hike their health insurance costs and are responding by boosting their workers\u2019 share of the cost, according to a Wednesday survey. Eighty-eight percent of companies expect Obamacare itself to increase the cost over providing health care to employees, according to a study by the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans which questioned close to 700 human resources and health benefits professionals.\u201d\n\nOregon ObamaCare premiums set to spike\n\nThe Hill: \u201cConsumers who bought health insurance through Cover Oregon could see their premiums rise by as much as 16 percent or fall by as much as 21 percent next year. The numbers, revealed this week by state officials, represent the most dramatic price changes proposed by insurers for 2015.\u201d\n\nPoll says ObamaCare losing ground - Bloomberg: \u201cFifty-eight percent of poll respondents they\u2019re unhappy with [President Obama\u2019s] handling of the health-care issue, up from 54 percent in a March poll. And the majority who oppose the law includes 42 percent who said it went too far while 11 percent object because it didn\u2019t go far enough.\u201d\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s Megan Garber explains how a pioneering video-on-demand technology called \u201cthe Box\u201d made Sir Mix-a-Lot\u2019s 1992 booty jam \u201cBaby Got Back\u201d a massive hit. \u201c\u2026MTV wouldn\u2019t play it any time but the evening. It also wouldn\u2019t let you watch the thing on repeat, the better to marvel at the dancing and memorize the lyrics. It wouldn\u2019t let you experience music videos, in other words, in the relatively intimate way we\u2019re used to experiencing them today, on the web. And that (along with its obvious artistry\u2014anacondas! Hondas! Fonda!) helped to propel \u2018Baby Got Back\u2019 into its ongoing popularity.\u201d\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has vowed to not campaign against any of his fellow Senate incumbents, after Dave Brat\u2019s stunning primary victory over House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, Cruz came awfully close to putting his hand in the fire. \u201cYou look at the results in Virginia last night, Dave Brat was outspent almost 50 to 1, and yet the people woke up and said, \u2018We\u2019re tired of business as usual in Washington,\u2019\u201d said Cruz told radio host Glenn Beck Wednesday. \u201cLook at the Senate election results in Mississippi, where the fourth longest serving member of the senate is suddenly found himself in a runoff because Chris McDaniel is running a strong grassroots campaign. How does Washington respond? By heaping lies and personal attacks, and trying to attack any candidate who takes on the Washington status quo.\u201d McDaniel challenged longtime incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran from the right and forced him into a runoff in early June. The two will go at it again in a June 24 runoff.\n\n[Club for Growth launches a new campaign today that throws $2.5 million behind McDaniel and against Cochran.]\n\nCarr ready to run down Alexander - \u201cOur country\u2019s leadership, especially those in the Republican Party, have departed from the Republican National Committee platform,\u201d state Rep. Joe Carr said to Sean Hannity on \u201cHannity\u201d Wednesday night. Carr challenges Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn. in the Aug. 7 primary. \u201cWhat we have done is, as a party, we\u2019ve laid out these set of principles, values and beliefs, yet when our men and women go to Washington, they seem to forget the very issues that they run on.\u201d\n\nCuccinelli takes helm at DeMint\u2019s Senate Conservatives Fund - Washington Examiner: \u201cThe Republican former attorney general of Virginia [Ken Cuccinelli], who last year lost a bid for governor in a high-profile match-up against Democrat Terry McAuliffe, will take the reins as president of Senate Conservatives Fund, the group announced Wednesday\u2026. \u2018I\u2019ve always had tremendous respect for this organization and applaud its members for working to elect principled conservatives,\u2019 Cuccinelli said. \u2018SCF has given our nation\u2019s grassroots a powerful voice and I\u2019m excited to join them in the fight.\u2019\u201d]\n\nCANTOR SEEKS TO LEAVE LEGACY WITH MCCARTHY PICK\n\nFox News: \u201cCantor threw his support behind House GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy for the post, offering his \u2018full support\u2019 and saying \u2018he\u2019d make an outstanding majority leader.\u2019 He stressed that he\u2019s not sure whether McCarthy is running, though he is widely expected to enter the competition. Reps. [Jim Jordan, R-Ohio,] and Pete Sessions, R-Texas, are also considered potential candidates for the post.\u201d Speaker John Boehner hastily set the vote in a little more than a week, June 19, seemingly to shoo McCarthy into the position.\n\n[GOP conference chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., is opting out of the leadership race. The (Spokane, Wash.) Spokesman-Review: \u201cMcMorris Rodgers\u2019s staff released a statement that she would not seek either the majority leader or whip position but would remain in the No. 4 spot on the leadership race. She did not return a request for comment.\u201d]\n\nBoehner heads right back to Obama battle - \u201cThis is the time for unity; the time for focus \u2013 focus on the thing we all know to be true: the failure of Barack Obama\u2019s policies and our obligation to show the American people we offer them not just a viable alternative, but a better future.\u201d \u2013 Speaker John Boehner to Eric Cantor after Cantor announced his resignation.\n\n[Fox News Radio\u2019s Rachel Sutherland takes a deep dive into the Virginia 7th District outcome and how it can shape the balance of power. Listen here. ]\n\nHeritage Action head: Cronyism killed Cantor - Heritage Action President Michael Needham writing in USA Today: \u201cDave Brat\u2019s stunning victory on Tuesday caused widespread panic among those who make their living on Wall Street and the special-interest lobbyists on K Street, but it created an opportunity for the Republican Party to embrace a policy agenda that works for Main Street.\u201d\n\nGRIMES GRABS ENVIRO CASH AMID COAL KERFUFFLE\n\nStill smarting from the revelation that she failed to deliver on promises to stand up for coal at a Washington fundraiser hosted by advocates of President Obama\u2019s global warming crackdown, Kentucky Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes is going back to anti-carbon donors to finance her bid to unseat Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. The Hill: \u201cDreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg and Hollywood mega-producer Harvey Weinstein are hosting a fundraiser for Grimes on June 23 in New York City, according to an invitation obtained by the Sunlight Foundation, with expected donations ranging from $2,600 for an individual and $5,200 for a couple.\u201d\n\nCOTTON PICKS ON PRYOR\u2019S VOTE FOR OBAMACARE\n\nThe Hill: \u201cRep. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) released a new ad slamming opponent Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) for \u201ctoeing the line,\u201d accusing him of blindly voting with his party and with President Obama. In the ad, Cotton insists he would show backbone in office, standing up to his own party if necessary.\u201d\n\nPICK SIX: ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGH HOPES\n\nRepublicans can capture the Senate with a net gain of six seats this cycle. Which six Democrat-held Senate seats are the most vulnerable in November? The current consensus among Fox News First readers: Arkansas, Montana, Louisiana, South Dakota, North Carolina and West Virginia. Fox News First reader Marion Anderson from Idaho Springs, Colo. says \u201cWe are hopeful that [Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo.,] will unseat [Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo.] He definitely has potential and while Udall has already started the attack ads, Colorado may make a shift this time in an off year.\u201d\n\nShare your top six picks.

What\u2019s the deal? An accident? Construction? Nope. It\u2019s toadlets. The AP shares the story of the suburban Philadelphia Toad Detour: \u201cThe cycle starts in early spring when adult toads, which can fit in the palm of your hand, emerge from the woods to breed. They cross Port Royal Avenue, scale a 10-foot-high embankment and then travel down a densely vegetated hill to mate in the abandoned Upper Roxborough Reservoir. Their offspring \u2014 each about the size of a raisin \u2014 make the journey in reverse about six weeks later. So many baby toads were on the move Monday evening it looked like the road\u2019s muddy shoulder was alive. Volunteers scooped them up in plastic cups and deposited them on the habitat side of the street.\u201d\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News.
