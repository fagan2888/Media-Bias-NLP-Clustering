How far would you go to protect your religious liberty?

Wouldn’t you think, that if the government is willing to give exemptions to a number of organizations, that they would provide a blanket exemption for everyone when it pertains to violations of religious liberty?

Well, there’s a Supreme Court case that could set a new precedent.

AM 760’s Brett Winterble is joined by Adele Keim from The Becket Fund. She’s an attorney representing the Little Sisters of the Poor.

The Little Sisters of the Poor have a case before the Supreme Court on whether their religious liberty has been violated in requiring them to pay for the Affordable Care Act, as the ACA includes access to contraception, which goes against their values.

Listen below as Adele and Brett discuss their case, and then Brett’s listeners weigh in.
