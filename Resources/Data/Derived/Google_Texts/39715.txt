WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Two top House Republicans have subpoenaed Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, seeking documents involving payments to insurance companies to lower out-of-pocket costs for some people enrolled under the Affordable Care Act.

Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and Energy and Commerce Chairman Fred Upton maintain those "cost-sharing reduction" payments must be provided by Congress each year. The administration says they are permanently appropriated under the "Obamacare" law.

Lew maintains that it's premature to produce the documents since they're part of a lawsuit brought by House Republicans to void the payments.

Texas Republican Brady and Michigan Republican Upton are seeking the same information from the Department of Health and Human Services, but have held off subpoenaing HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell since she's promised to provide a briefing on the topic.
