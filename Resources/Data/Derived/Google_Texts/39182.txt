Cambridge Endoscopic Devices, a Framingham medical device manufacturer, has filed for bankruptcy after its sales declined and it couldn’t find a buyer.

The company listed assets of $3 million and liabilities of $17 million in filings in federal bankruptcy court. According to court filings, its advanced endoscopes and laparoscopes, which are used to make surgery less invasive, became too expensive for many hospitals to buy after the passage of the Affordable Care Act.

Cambridge Endoscopic filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, indicating that its business will be reorganized, not dissolved. The company and its law firm didn’t return calls for comment left Friday afternoon.

More than 40 potential buyers contacted over the past two years but didn’t make a “viable offer” for the company, it said in a filing. It listed $355,000 in income in 2013, $328,000 last year, and $70,000 so far this year. The vast majority of its assets were intellectual property, including patents filed for surgical instruments.

Its biggest creditor was identified as White Sand Beach LLC, a New York-based group of lenders owed $9.7 million.
