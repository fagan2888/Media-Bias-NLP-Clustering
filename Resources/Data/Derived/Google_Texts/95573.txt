Continuing a popular service, volunteer tax preparers in the AARP Tax-Aide Program will provide free tax filing assistance to seniors by appointment only. Appointments are available at the Alfred Rubin Riverwalk Community Center, 305 W. Jackson Ave., from February 3 through April 6, 2016.

Those interested in scheduling a 45-minute appointment for tax assistance may call the Naperville Park District at 630-848-3613. Membership in AARP is not required.

Like thousands of other volunteers across the country, the local AARP Tax-Aide volunteers complete training courses in aspects of tax law with materials supplied by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The volunteers provide free electronic filing services using IRS software that also is used by many paid professionals.

Individuals who register for tax assistance are asked to bring all necessary paperwork to their appointment, including the following:

• Last year's tax return and tax records

• A photo ID for each adult who will be listed on the tax return

• Proof of Social Security number (i.e., Social Security card, Social Security 1099 form, or

Medicare card) for each individual and dependent listed on the tax return

• Checking account routing number for direct deposit information

• Income documents, including W-2, 1099, etc.

• Information about tax-deductible items, including dependents, interest, real estate tax bill, state

tax bill, charitable donation receipts, etc.

• Those who acquired healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) must present

Form 1095 showing proof of coverage
