Tsai said the fiscal 2016 increase can be kept to 5.6 percent, holding to Gov. Charlie Baker's budget plan, by \"right sizing\" enrollment, adjusting the schedule of payments to providers, maximizing federal reimbursements, and more.\n\nTsai addressed members of the House and Senate Ways and Means Committee during an April 9 state budget hearing at Springfield's Tower Square. The hearing featured testimony from Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders and her top staffers.\n\nBaker's fiscal 2016 budget sets aside $15.3 billion for MassHealth. The spending would have been $16.9 billion if the status quo had been maintained, said Tsai, who outlined a path to cut gross Medicaid spending by $1.6 billion, or $761 million in net state dollars.\n\nMaking sure only eligible people receive benefits can \"right size\" the caseload and save $210 million; $65 million can be cut by a range of tactics including eliminating a chiropractor benefit; adjusting the schedule of payments to providers could yield savings as high as $456 million, said Tsai.\n\nThe MassHealth assistant secretary said another $30 million can be realized by maximizing federal revenues. In fiscal 2016, federal dollars are projected to cover 55 percent of total MassHealth spending.\n\nThe most significant driver of MassHealth's cost growth is enrollment, said Tsai. The lack of a functioning Health Connector website for 16 months, starting in October 2013, led to placing 300,000 people in temporary coverage because eligibility checks could not be completed. The website is now largely functional, said Tsai, with some remaining problems being worked out.\n\nMassachusetts is moving aggressively to conduct 1.2 million outstanding eligibility reviews by the end of the calendar year, said Tsai.\n\n\"Some people have not undergone an eligibility review since 2012,\" he said.\n\nThe state is also matching data to catch people who may not be eligible for Medicaid, and looking for members who could receive their primary coverage through employers.\n\nSignificant enrollment increases also stemmed from state and federal health care laws, including the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\nMassachusetts spending per enrollee is 31 percent higher than the national average for Medicaid programs, reflecting the high cost of market-rate health care in the state, said Tsai.\n\nOn the topic of cost drivers, Tsai said counterproductive incentives are \"baked into\" traditional fee-for-service reimbursements, rewarding volume of care rather than quality of outcomes.\n\n\"I could talk about this at length, but for now I'll say it's one of our highest priorities,\" said Tsai, who vowed to reform the payment methodology and \"bend the cost curve.\"\n\nCapping off his list, Tsai said MassHealth would reduce opioid prescriptions to 14 days to cut costs and prevent abuse, reform the purchase of durable medical equipment, and strengthen controls to end inappropriate emergency services payments.\n\nThe Office of Medicaid proposes no new cuts to provider rates.\n\nTsai called for \"a new way of working together\" with providers and stakeholders to put MassHealth on a sustainable footing. He said under his watch, the Medicaid office will commit to providing excellent customer service, effective program management, and accountable patient care.\n\nBaker, calling MassHealth a \"budget buster,\" has said holding down the cost of health care will free up funding for local aid, education, transportation, the Department of Children and Families, and increasing the reimbursement rate for human service providers.\n\nThe joint committee has been traveling the state gathering input on Baker's $38.1 billion fiscal 2016 budget proposal.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nMary Serreze can be reached at mserreze@gmail.com", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@homepage','fiscal-2016','health-care','marylou-sudders','masshealth','springfield'", "title": "MassHealth chief Daniel Tsai finds $761 million in savings while preserving eligibility and services", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"MassHealth chief Daniel Tsai finds $761 million in savings while preserving eligibility and services\", \"link\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/04/masshealth_chief_dan_tsai_find.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.masslive.com/home/mass-media/width620/img/breakingnews/photo/2015/04/09/17472013-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15678407\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-04-10T01:40:27Z\", \"author\": \"Mary Serreze | Special to The Republican\", \"tags\": [\"@homepage\",\"fiscal-2016\",\"health-care\",\"marylou-sudders\",\"masshealth\",\"springfield\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.masslive.com/breakingnews/photo/2015/04/09/17472013-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "The state will conduct 1.2 million eligibility reviews by the end of the calendar year.", "card": "summary", "site": "@masslivenews"}, "article_date_updated": "Thursday, April 09, 2015,  9:52 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.masslive.com/breakingnews/photo/2015/04/09/committee-membersjpg-adb75459e7101530.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"mserreze\", \"author_nickname\": \"Mary Serreze | Special to The Republican\", \"author_id\": \"1684726\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Politics - MassLive.com\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "masslive.com", "description": "The state will conduct 1.2 million eligibility reviews by the end of the calendar year.", "title": "MassHealth chief Daniel Tsai finds $761 million in savings while preserving eligibility and services", "url": "http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/04/masshealth_chief_dan_tsai_find.html", "image": "http://www.masslive.com/static/aff/static/img/logos/logo_fb.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "masslive.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Thursday, April 09, 2015,  9:45 PM", "article_author": "Mary Serreze | Special to The Republican", "Description": "The state will conduct 1.2 million eligibility reviews by the end of the calendar year."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda1d6\"", "article_summary": "Tsai addressed members of the House and Senate Ways and Means Committee during an April 9 state budget hearing at Springfield's Tower Square.\nSignificant enrollment increases also stemmed from state and federal health care laws, including the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\nMassachusetts is moving aggressively to conduct 1.2 million outstanding eligibility reviews by the end of the calendar year, said Tsai.\nTsai called for \"a new way of working together\" with providers and stakeholders to put MassHealth on a sustainable footing.\nThe joint committee has been traveling the state gathering input on Baker's $38.1 billion fiscal 2016 budget proposal."}
