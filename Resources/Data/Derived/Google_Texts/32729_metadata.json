They suggest the imposition of \u201cfair\u201d prices.\n\nBut are high prices truly a problem for patients? Physicians\u2019 overuse of treatments that have small marginal benefit and high financial, physical and psychological costs is far more troublesome.\n\nThe oncologists claim that with insurance out-of-pocket expenses running 20 percent to 30 percent of cost, a cancer patient could be responsible for $25,000 to $30,000. But most insurances have far lower maximum out-of-pocket expense limits: Affordable Care Act exchange insurance policies set maximum out-of-pocket limits at $6,600 for individuals and $13,200 for families; Medicare\u2019s Part D Catastrophic Coverage Threshold is $4,700 after which patients pay a maximum of 5 percent of drug costs; many large group employer plans have similar limits.\n\nIn addition, most drug companies have assistance programs for patients who cannot afford their drugs. Finally, most insurers and hospitals negotiate substantial discounts from list prices. Drugs are not the greatest financial risk to cancer patients \u2014 drugs are only a small percentage of the high costs of cancer care.\n\nThe oncologists concede that drug companies are entitled to a \u201creasonable expectation of return on investment\u201d and \u201creasonable profits.\u201d But drug development is expensive and unpredictable. It\u2019s hard to forecast which drugs will be successfully developed and FDA approved and harder still to know which approved drugs will be clinically and financially successful.\n\nThe average cost to market for a new drug is $2.6 billion, comprising out-of-pocket costs including expenditures on failed projects (only one in 10 drugs reaches the market) and opportunity costs (the value of foregone earnings from alternative investments).\n\nOncology drug development often costs more. Approved drugs with marginal benefits and limited market success are just as risky and expensive to develop as breakthrough drugs. To continue new product development companies must cover the R&D and opportunity costs of many failures and few successes.\n\nOncologists are no better arbiters of what is \u201creasonable\u201d profit or return on investment than anyone else. Their expertise is in prescribing treatments that will be of value to their patients. Yet it is precisely in this area that they have been deficient.\n\nA 2012 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) panel identified widespread chemotherapy use among patients for whom there was no evidence of clinical value. Despite the lack of evidence supporting the practice and ASCO recommendations against it, chemotherapy is widely used in advanced cancer patients with poor performance status.\n\nWhile ASCO does recommend treating terminal patients who have good performance status, a new JAMA Oncology study casts doubt on this chemotherapy since it did not improve survival and worsened patients\u2019 quality of life.\n\nNot all new, expensive cancer treatments are worthless. Imatinib (Gleevec) \u2014 costing $30,000-$100,000 per year for life \u2014 improved Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia five-year survival from 31 percent to 90 percent. But most therapies for solid cancers are far less effective. New cancer drugs are routinely approved that offer statistically significant, but clinically unimportant, improvements.\n\nCetuximab (Erbitux) was touted at ASCO\u2019s 2008 meeting for improving lung cancer treatment. The survival advantage was only 1.2 months and was accompanied by high rates of side effects. Likewise, the FDA approved Erlotinib (Tarceva) to treat pancreatic cancer on the basis of a 0.4 month (12 days) improvement in survival with increased rates of severe rash and diarrhea.\n\nThere is no reason, outside of a research study, that oncologists should offer successive rounds of minimally-effective treatments, but they routinely do. Physicians understandably feel an emotional imperative to \u201cdo something\u201d when dealing with desperate cancer patients. But that \u201csomething\u201d should provide a favorable risk/benefit relationship and not mislead anxious patients. Nothing forces an oncologist to prescribe expensive, ineffective medications with multiple side effects when a cheaper, equally (in)effective medicine, or no treatment at all, will do.\n\nIf oncologists limited their prescription of high-cost, low-value, drugs, prices would decline to stimulate sales and would more accurately reflect the drugs\u2019 value to patients. When Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center announced it would not use Aflibercept (Zaltrap) because it was twice as expensive as, and no more effective than alternative (minimally-effective) medicines, the manufacturer, Sanofi, citing \u201cmarket resistance,\u201d cut the price in half.\n\nNo one wants to pay high drug prices. Measures to ameliorate escalating development costs are needed. Meanwhile, oncologists can best serve their patients by limiting the use of expensive treatments that offer little more than side effects and false hopes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No one wants to pay high drug prices.
