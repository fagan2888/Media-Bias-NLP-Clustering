This document, rarely discussed by the media, is the source of some of the most dramatic social, cultural, political, linguistic, educational and economic transformations that have occurred in our history.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nThe document is known as a green card. It is handed out to foreign nationals who apply for permanent admission into the United States. A green card grants foreign nationals lifelong legal residence within the United States as well as: authorization to occupy any U.S. job, freedom to collect welfare, and a guaranteed track to U.S. citizenship and voting.\n\nFor all of the extravagant, yet half-hearted and failed efforts to secure the border, a simple one-sentence change to federal law\u2014 decreeing a pause on all green cards\u2014 would have had an infinitely more substantial impact on immigration to the United States. That is because the vast bulk of all immigration to the United States occurs through the green card and has absolutely nothing to do with our nation\u2019s border.\n\nEven if all of the politicians\u2019 supposed efforts to secure the border had proven successful\u2014 and the border were completely sealed\u2014 long-term immigration levels would be little affected.\n\nEven if not a single illegal immigrant were able to cross the border in the next ten years, the United States would still add 10 million new permanent immigrants and smash all immigration records\u2014 exclusively through the process of allowing foreigners to apply for green cards.\n\nIt now appears increasingly likely these transformative sheets of green paper will be a major issue in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nIn recent months, a series of facts and circumstances have brought the green card into national focus: reports documenting the sustained compression of the middle class during the forty-year green card wave; the discovery that all net job creation among working-age people went to foreign workers from 2000-2014; evidence documenting the overcrowding of schools where a growing number of students qualify for free meals and require language instruction; the breakdown of social cohesion; and the blue-ward shift in the electoral landscape of formerly red states.\n\nAll of these facts combined to direct the public\u2019s attention to the most impactful, yet so rarely discussed, little slip of tinted paper.\n\nAs of Monday night\u2019s New Hampshire Republican presidential candidate\u2019s forum, the green card officially emerged as a part of the 2016 immigration debate. The forum\u2019s moderator and WGIR-AM radio host Jack Heath asked:\n\nSo much is made of illegal immigration. Until we get a handle on that, should we reduce the number of green cards granted legally each year to folks who want to get into this country through the legal process? Should we cut down that number? What should that number be each year?\n\nSimilarly, conservative thought leaders have sounded off in recent days urging a halt to all green cards until the record 42 million immigrants residing in the United States have been assimilated and the battalions of unemployed Americans\u2014 including a shocking share of the black population\u2014 have been absorbed into the workforce by corporate CEOs who would prefer to import foreign substitutes.\n\nAmong the conservatives calling for a pause on all new immigration\u2014 that is a green card moratorium\u2014 is popular talk radio host and legal scholar, Mark Levin:\n\nLevin told listeners:\n\nLegal immigration in this country\u2026 over one million a year\u2014 over ten years, that\u2019s ten million\u2014 it\u2019s an enormous number and then you have chain migration behind it. The country can\u2019t assimilate and Americanize this many people\u2014it just can\u2019t\u2026 Why can\u2019t you reduce the number of legal immigrants coming into this country by 25 percent? I would even argue by fifty percent. As a matter of fact, I would go even further, we need a respite of several years.\n\nTalk radio host Rush Limbaugh, citing a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee report obtained exclusively by Breitbart News, similarly informed his millions of listeners that, historically, when immigration last surged during the Western immigration wave from Europe, the government instituted an immigration reduction that caused the total foreign-born population to decline for six decades:\n\nThe United States gives legal residency status, green cards, to over a million legal immigrants, each and every year. Do you know that that is more than the rest of the world does combined? That\u2019s a revealing statistic. Over a million \u2014 1.05 million green cards a year\u2026 [Do] you realize, from, I forget the exact years, but through 1924 through 1965, there was no immigration? Not legal, anyway. Zilch. And you know why? Because we stopped everything in order to assimilate the masses of immigrants from Europe\u2026 Decades and decades of no immigration. And look at the arguments we are having now. I mean, the numbers were nothing like what we have today.\n\nIndeed, each year the United States issues more than one million green cards to many of the poorest and least-developed nations in the world. Unlike the prior wave, these are from non-western countries. Many Americans would be surprised to learn that most of the low-wage workers competing with them for jobs are invited into the country not in defiance of U.S. law, but as a consequence of U.S law\u2014 the one lobbied for Ted Kennedy in 1965. In addition to these green cards are nearly one million handpicked foreign workers imported on work visas, dependents of foreign workers imported on work visas, and refugees.\n\nFor example, in the past decade, we have issued more than 1.5 million green cards to Mexican foreign nationals. Overall, about half of all Mexican immigrants have green cards or are naturalized after getting green cards. That means that for every one Mexican who crosses the border illegally (or overstays a temporary visa), another Mexican is mailed a green card and is allowed to reside permanently with all the benefits of legal residency. To put it another way, the presence of green cards has roughly doubled all Mexican immigration into the United States.\n\nLast year, of the one million new immigrants selected for permanent residence in the United States on a green card, 800,000 of them were from either Asia or Latin America; 100,000 of them were from Africa. Less than 10% were from Western countries with similar political systems. Hispanics and Asians vote 2-to-1 for Democrats and big government policy, creating ironically similar economic conditions to the ones they left behind. For this reason, large amounts of brand new non-western immigration make life more difficult\u2014 not better\u2014 for the immigrants themselves, by allowing them to replicate failed political conditions and denying opportunities for positive assimilation.\n\nIn recent years, about one out of every seven new legal immigrants is from Mexico, and about 9 out of every 10 new immigrants brought into the country on green cards is from Latin America, Africa, Asia, or the Middle East. The vast majority of future immigration from these non-Western regions will all be through the legal dispensation of green cards, including almost all Muslim immigration.\n\nIn 2013, we added nearly five times more immigrants on green cards from Pakistan (13,251) than Australia (2,759). We added nearly six times more immigrants on green cards from El Salvador (18,260) than Italy (2,960). And we issued more than 10 times more green cards to Mexicans (135,028) than Brits, Scots and Northern Irish (12,984).\n\nThus far, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker is the only top-polling Republican presidential contender to articulate an openness to potentially slowing the green card express. If the express is not slowed, in less than ten years, all known immigration records in terms of immigrant to population ratio will be exceeded forever.\n\nBy contrast, Republican presidential and vice presidential aspirant Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) has introduced legislation\u2014known as the I-Squared bill\u2014 which would remove the green card cap placed on foreign youths sought by college administrators, a major new pipeline for Islamic immigration. Rubio was also the co-architect of the Gang of Eight plan to make 30 million green cards available in the span of one decade.\n\nThe green card tsunami has been a disaster for communities of color.\n\nAs Harvard Professor George Borjas has analyzed: \u201cA 10% immigration-induced increase in the supply of workers in a particular skill group reduced the black wage of that group by 2.5%, lowered the employment rate by 5.9 percentage points, and increased the incarceration rate by 1.3 percentage points.\u201d When Borjas studied the period of record immigration from 1960-2000 he found, \u201cThis immigrant influx lowered the wages of native-born blacks by 4.5 percent, and of native-born Hispanics by 5 percent.\u201d\n\nU.S. Civil Rights Commissioner Peter Kirsanow has similarly discovered that, \u201cCompetition from immigration accounts for approximately 40 percent of the 18 percentage point decline in black employment in recent years. That\u2019s nearly a million jobs lost by blacks to immigrants.\u201d\n\nAs for the impact on crime, the Manhattan Institute\u2019s Heather MacDonald demonstrated that: \u201cBetween the foreign-born generation and their American children, the incarceration rate of Mexican-Americans jumps more than eightfold, resulting in an incarceration rate that is 3.45 times higher than that of whites.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "It's Official: Green Cards Now Part of 2016 Debate", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "It's Official: Green Cards Now Part of 2016 Debate", "title": "It's Official: Green Cards Now Part of 2016 Debate - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Immigrants-line-up-for-delayed-deport-and-work-permits-AP-DAMIAN-DOVARGANES.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/05/its-official-green-cards-now-part-of-2016-debate/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's Official: Green Cards Now Part of 2016 Debate", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/Immigrants-line-up-for-delayed-deport-and-work-permits-AP-DAMIAN-DOVARGANES.jpg", "title": "It's Official: Green Cards Now Part of 2016 Debate - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": ",Big Government, Immigration,green cards", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "published_time": "2015-08-05T18:18:26-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc26d\"", "article_summary": "Overall, about half of all Mexican immigrants have green cards or are naturalized after getting green cards.\nRubio was also the co-architect of the Gang of Eight plan to make 30 million green cards available in the span of one decade.\nAnd we issued more than 10 times more green cards to Mexicans (135,028) than Brits, Scots and Northern Irish (12,984).\nFor example, in the past decade, we have issued more than 1.5 million green cards to Mexican foreign nationals.\nAs of Monday night\u2019s New Hampshire Republican presidential candidate\u2019s forum, the green card officially emerged as a part of the 2016 immigration debate."}
