The 2015 Boulder County Fair celebrated its launch this morning with one of its most popular features, the parade on Main Street, sponsored by the Kiwanis Club of Longmont.

The weather cooperated, with nearly cloudless skies and temperatures in the mid-70s, on their way up to 90 under nearly cloudless skies. Conditions for the fair are expected to continue to be splendid, with plenty of sun and temperatures well into the 80s through the week.

The Boulder County Fair, centered at the Boulder County Fairgrounds, 9595 Nelson Road, Longmont, offers the usual wide variety of family-oriented activities every day through Aug. 9. For more information, go to bouldercountyfair.org.
