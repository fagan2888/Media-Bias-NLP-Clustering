(AP) \u2014 On a desert outpost miles from the closest paved road, Navajo students at the Little Singer Community School gleefully taste traditional fry bread during the school\u2019s heritage week.\n\n\u201cIt reminds us of the Native American people a long time ago,\u201d says a smiling 9-year-old, Arissa Chee.\n\nThe cheer comes in the midst of dire surroundings: Little Singer, like so many of the 183 Indian schools overseen by the federal government, is verging on decrepit.\n\nThe school, which serves 81 students, consists of a cluster of rundown classroom buildings containing asbestos, radon, mice, mold and flimsy outside door locks. The newest building, a large, white monolithic dome that is nearly 20 years old, houses the gym.\n\nOn a recent day, students carried chairs above their heads while they changed classes, so they would have a place to sit.\n\nThese are schools, says Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, whose department is responsible for them, \u201cthat you or I would not feel good sending our kids to, and I don\u2019t feel good sending Indian kids there, either.\u201d\n\nFederally owned schools for Native Americans on reservations are marked by remoteness, extreme poverty and few construction dollars.\n\nThe schools serve about 48,000 children, or about 7 percent of Indian students, and are among the country\u2019s lowest performing. At Little Singer, less than one-quarter of students were deemed proficient in reading and math on a 2012-2013 assessment.\n\nThe Obama administration is pushing ahead with a plan to improve the schools that gives tribes more control. But the endeavor is complicated by disrepair of so many buildings, not to mention a federal legacy dating to the 19th century that for many years forced Native American children to attend boarding schools.\n\nLittle Singer was the vision in the 1970s of a medicine man of the same name who wanted local children educated in the community.\n\nStudents often come from families struggling with domestic violence, alcoholism and a lack of running water at home, so nurturing is emphasized. The school provides showers, along with shampoo and washing machines.\n\nConflicts and discipline problems are resolved with traditional \u201cpeacemaking\u201d discussions, and occasionally the use of a sweat lodge.\n\nPrincipal Etta Shirley\u2019s day starts at 6 a.m., when on her way to work, she picks up kids off the bus routes. Because there\u2019s no teacher housing, a caravan of teachers commutes together about 90 minutes each morning on barely passable dirt roads.\n\nAll this, to teach in barely passable quarters.\n\n\u201cWe have little to work with, but we make do with what we have,\u201d says Verna Yazzie, a school board member.\n\nThe school is on the government\u2019s priority list for replacement.\n\nIt\u2019s been there since at least 2004.\n\n___\n\nThe 183 schools are spread across 23 states and fall under the jurisdiction of the Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Indian Education.\n\nThey are in some of the most out-of-the-way places in America; one is at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, reachable by donkey or helicopter. Most are small, with fewer than 150 students.\n\nNative Americans perform better in schools that are not overseen by the federal bureau than in schools that are, national and state assessments show. Overall, they trail their peers in an important national assessment and struggle with a graduation rate of 68 percent.\n\nPresident Barack Obama visited Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota in June, where he announced the school improvement plan.\n\nAlready, tribes manage about 120 schools, and the plan will turn the rest over as Washington shifts to more of a support role.\n\nThe plan also calls for more board-certified teachers, better Internet access and less red tape, making it easier to buy books and hire teachers. The Interior Department wants to help schools accelerate the use of Native American languages and culture.\n\nBut the rundown state of many schools cannot be ignored.\n\nMore than 60 are listed in poor condition. Less than one-third have the Internet and the computer capability to administer new student assessments that are rolling out in much of the country.\n\nAn estimated $1.3 billion is needed to replace or refurbish these schools, or at least hundreds of millions to fix parts of them. But since the 2009 release of about $280 million in stimulus money, little has gone to major school construction or renovation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indian schools face decayed buildings, poverty", "title": "Indian schools face decayed buildings, poverty", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Indian schools face decayed buildings, poverty", "title": "Indian schools face decayed buildings, poverty", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/10/18/indian_schools_face_decayed_buildings_poverty/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/indian-schools.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Indian schools face decayed buildings, poverty", "title": "Indian schools face decayed buildings, poverty", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/indian-schools.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Kimberly Hefling", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2462\"", "article_summary": "The schools serve about 48,000 children, or about 7 percent of Indian students, and are among the country\u2019s lowest performing.\nThe cheer comes in the midst of dire surroundings: Little Singer, like so many of the 183 Indian schools overseen by the federal government, is verging on decrepit.\nLittle Singer was the vision in the 1970s of a medicine man of the same name who wanted local children educated in the community.\nAt Little Singer, less than one-quarter of students were deemed proficient in reading and math on a 2012-2013 assessment.\n___The 183 schools are spread across 23 states and fall under the jurisdiction of the Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Indian Education."}
