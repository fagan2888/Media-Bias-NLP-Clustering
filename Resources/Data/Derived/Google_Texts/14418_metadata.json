These laws restrict certain financial arrangements between hospitals, physicians, and other parties to prevent issues associated with payments connected to referrals.

Of note, hospitals would be required to develop and implement a discharge planning process within 24 hours of admission or registration of inpatient and certain types of outpatient beneficiaries.\n\nThis rule is scheduled for publication in the Federal Register on Tuesday, November 3. A 60 day comment period will run thereafter.\n\nCMS Establishes Methods for Assuring Access to Covered Medicaid Services\n\nOn Thursday, October 29, CMS released a final rule titled \u201cMedicaid Program; Methods for Assuring Access to Covered Medicaid Services.\u201d This rule requires states to review data and trends in the Medicaid program to evaluate access to care for covered services. Additionally, states must obtain public input on the adequacy of access to care to covered services in the Medicaid program. If shortcomings are discovered, states must take corrective action.\n\nIn coordination with this final rule, CMS on the same day published a request for information titled \u201cMedicaid Program; Request for Information (RFI) \u2013 Data Metrics and Alterative Processes for Access to Care in the Medicaid Program.\u201d This RFI solicits feedback from stakeholders on the access to care measures and metrics, which would be useful to CMS and states in ensuring access to care for Medicaid beneficiaries. Stakeholders will have 60 days to submit comments.\n\nTwo-Midnight Rule Revisions Finalized\n\nOn Thursday, October 29, and Friday, October 30, CMS finalized the FY 2016 policies and rates for the following payment systems: home health prospective payment system (PPS); hospital outpatient PPS; hospital inpatient PPS; ambulatory surgical center payment system; physician fee schedule; and end-stage renal disease PPS.\n\nAs anticipated, CMS revised the two-midnight rule in its final rule titled \u201cMedicare Program: Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment and Ambulatory Surgical Payment Systems and Quality Reporting Programs; Short Inpatient Hospital Stays; Transition for Certain Medicare-Dependent, Small Rural Hospitals Under the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System; Provider Administrative Appeals and Judicial Review.\u201d This rule expands the \u201crare and unusual\u201d exceptions policy to allow for Medicare Part A payment on a case-by-case basis for inpatient admissions that do not currently satisfy the two-midnight benchmark.
