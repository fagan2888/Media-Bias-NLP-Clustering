A new health show, Clinic Online, on the Pakistani television channel Health TV, is trying to change this by addressing the subject of sexuality in a medical and professional manner. In a country where even breast cancer was once a taboo subject, doctors will now be taking viewers' calls on air, answering questions ranging from STDs to abortion.\n\nIn Pakistan, like many Islamic countries, talking about the body in public is taboo. For that reason, the show's host, Dr. Nadim Uddin Siddiqui, emphasizes that the sexual topics on the show will be discussed in an objective, scientific way.\n\n\u201cThis is a very sensitive topic, so I\u2019ll try to keep this topic in a respective manner and not to produce any type of controversy on my program,\u201d Siddiqui told AFP. \u201cThese are infections, these are disease. We have to fight against the disease, whatever the disease is.\u201d\n\nHowever, to make sure things don't get too controversial in the Muslim country, there is a religious leader on call to guide the discussion in the correct spiritual direction. Although abortion is illegal in Pakistan, the mufti, or Islamic scholar, Shahid Madani, explained that Sharia law made exceptions for circumstances where the life of the mother was in danger.\n\n\u201cThe life of a mother is a reality, and that of the child if not yet certain,\u201d Madani said.\n\nStill, regardless of the extreme efforts the show takes to maintain a professional outlook on sexual health, according to AFP, it's still causing an uproar in Pakistan.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "pakistan, breaking, taboo, and, addressing, sexual, health, television, clinic, online", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Pakistan now has its very own public sexual health show where viewers can call up anonymously and ask a doctor their most intimate questions.", "title": "Pakistan Has Its Very First Public Sex Ed Clinic, And It's Causing Quite A Stir [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pakistan-breaking-taboo-and-addressing-sexual-health-television-clinic-online-312306", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/26/siddiqui.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pakistan now has its very own public sexual health show where viewers can call up anonymously and ask a doctor their most intimate questions.", "title": "Pakistan Has Its Very First Public Sex Ed Clinic, And It's Causing Quite A Stir [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pakistan-breaking-taboo-and-addressing-sexual-health-television-clinic-online-312306", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/26/siddiqui.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/11/26/siddiqui.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2014-11-26T11:50:39-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-26T11:50:38-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Pakistan now has its very own public sexual health show where viewers can call up anonymously and ask a doctor their most intimate questions."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc412\"", "article_summary": "A new health show, Clinic Online, on the Pakistani television channel Health TV, is trying to change this by addressing the subject of sexuality in a medical and professional manner.\nStill, regardless of the extreme efforts the show takes to maintain a professional outlook on sexual health, according to AFP, it's still causing an uproar in Pakistan.\nIn a country where even breast cancer was once a taboo subject, doctors will now be taking viewers' calls on air, answering questions ranging from STDs to abortion.\nPakistan may be known for a lot of things, but openness toward sex is not one of them.\nIn Pakistan, like many Islamic countries, talking about the body in public is taboo."}
