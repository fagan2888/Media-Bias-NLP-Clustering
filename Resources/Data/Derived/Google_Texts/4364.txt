SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) — The Los Angeles Marathon didn’t even wait for the sun to rise.

With a hot day expected, the women’s race started at 6:45 a.m. local time and the men’s race 10 minutes later. Hours later, Kenyan runners Daniel Limo and Ogla Kimaiyo won the races, while Jared Ward and Blake Russell captured the USA Track & Field National Championships that were run concurrently.

Limo fell behind countryman Edwin Koech around mile 20 but caught him two miles later and won going away in 2 hours, 10 minutes, 36 seconds to claim the $25,000 first prize. Lani Rutto of Kenya also caught Koech and finished second for the second straight year, this time in 2:12:43. Koech finished fourth.

Ward took the lead in Mile 16 and never faltered, finishing third overall in a personal best 2:12:56, bringing a $150,000 first prize. Matt Llano was second (sixth overall) in 2:16:13 and Mike Morgan was third in 2:16:55.

Kimaiyo led the women’s race from Mile 19 onward, leaving Russian Natalya Puchkova in Mile 23 and winning in 2:34:10. Puchkova was second in 2:34:33 and Russell was third overall in 2:34:57.

The race began in 71-degree heat at Dodger Stadium and finished in 75-degree temperatures near the Santa Monica Pier. But in between, the runners said, they felt the heat, which crept into the 80s as the race wound through Hollywood, West Hollywood and Beverly Hills.

“At eight (kilometers), there was still a lot of humidity,” Rutto said. “I tried to resist my best, but I not make it. I want to say it was tough.”

The race caused several runners to change strategy. Ward said he felt dehydrated at the 20-mile mark, “but at that point, you trust the fitness.” Kimaiyo carried a bottle of fluids the final 3.1 miles, adding her legs hurt. Russell suffered cramped hamstrings around Mile 11.

The race also served as a qualifier for next February’s Olympic trials, also in Los Angeles. All American male runners who finished at least 2:18 qualified, as did all women who finished in at least 2:43.
