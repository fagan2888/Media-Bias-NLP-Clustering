We have to do better by our kids,\u201d Assembly member Roger Hern\u00e1ndez, a Democrat, said in a statement.\n\nThe state\u2019s minimum wage rose from $9 to $10 at the beginning of the year.\n\nThe unions competing to raise it are Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW) and Service Employees International Union California (SEIU California).\n\n\u201cNo state or industrialized democracy has ever raised its real minimum wage to the level unions propose taking California to,\u201d James Sherk, The Heritage Foundation\u2019s research fellow in labor economics, told The Daily Signal.\n\n\u201cIf passed,\u201d Sherk said, \u201cthis initiative would eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs in California.\u201d\n\nSEIU California, which represents 15 local unions, proposes that the minimum wage increase to $15 by 2020\u2014with an exception that small businesses would have until 2021. The union is in the process of collecting signatures to get the Raise California\u2019s Wage and Paid Sick Days Act of 2016 to the ballot box.\n\nThe union also calls for at least six paid sick days annually for all full-time employees. Its efforts are backed by the nationwide Fight for $15 movement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud to stand by the 700,000 workers of SEIU California in a campaign that gives hope to underpaid workers and honors the backbreaking work they do,\u201d Hern\u00e1ndez said.\n\nSEIU California plans to spend $20 to $30 million on a statewide campaign, Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cThe Fight for $15 has won in Los Angeles, won in San Francisco, and I\u2019m proud to join SEIU California and the workers who energize this movement in a campaign to lift up underpaid workers statewide,\u201d state Sen. Isadore Hall III, D-South Bay, said in a formal statement.\n\nThe other union, SEIU-UHW, delivered 600,000 voter signatures last week to California election officials in hopes of qualifying to get its measure, the Fair Wage Act of 2016, on the ballot in November.\n\nLos Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley already have approved minimum wage hikes to $15 that will phase in, AP reported.\n\nRecent data shows that jobs in the restaurant and hotel sectors have seen a decline after minimum wage hikes in some cities\u2014including Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco.\n\nSome analysts say Wal-Mart stores in Oakland and Los Angeles closed because the minimum wages increased.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, has voiced concern that raising the minimum wage to $15 would hurt the state\u2019s ability to recover from a recession, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\n\nBrown said earlier this month that it would cost the state\u2019s general fund $4 billion a year to raise the minimum wage to $15.\n\nNevertheless, the unions and advocates of a $15 minimum wage push ahead.\n\n\u201cI work so hard to provide for me and my daughter, and that\u2019s almost impossible on the minimum wage in California,\u201d said Maria Sandoval, a cashier from Los Angeles who earns $10 an hour, according to SEIU-UHW.\n\n\u201cI want a better future for my daughter and that\u2019s why I collected so many signatures in my community to get this initiative on the ballot.\u201d\n\nThe initiative proposes that California\u2019s minimum wage jump to $11 in 2017, then increase a dollar more every year until it reaches $15 in 2021. For each year after, the wage would be automatically adjusted for the cost of living.\n\nThe Fair Wage Act effort is co-chaired by San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee and Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, both Democrats.\n\n\u201cThis one is moving ahead, it\u2019s farther along, it\u2019s simpler, it benefits 3.3 million workers with no carveouts,\u201d SEIU-UHW spokesman Sean Wherley told Bay Area news station KRON 4. \u201cThis is the one that\u2019s going ahead.\u201d\n\nLt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, has backed both measures.\n\nHeritage\u2019s Sherk cautions against the initiatives:", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cIf passed,\" Heritage Foundation labor economist James Sherk says, \"this initiative would eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs in California.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cIf passed,\" Heritage Foundation labor economist James Sherk says, \"this initiative would eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs in California.\u201d", "title": "How Unions Hope to Win a $15 Minimum Wage in California", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160115_CaliforniaMinWage_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-30T11:32:40+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1PgG4Ud"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cIf passed,\" Heritage Foundation labor economist James Sherk says, \"this initiative would eliminate hundreds of thousands of jobs in California.\u201d", "title": "How Unions Hope to Win a $15 Minimum Wage in California", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/160115_CaliforniaMinWage_Jessen.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "jobs,minimum wage", "published_time": "2016-01-25T20:07:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-30T11:32:40+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "California, minimum wage, fight for 15, Unions, jobs, economy, SEIU California, SEIU-UHW, Fair Wage Act, Raise California\u2019s Wage"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1990\"", "article_summary": "Two different unions are trying to get questions on the ballot for Californians to have a say on a $15 minimum wage.\nLabor unions are pushing to raise California\u2019s minimum wage to $15 an hour with two initiatives competing for voters\u2019 approval.\nNevertheless, the unions and advocates of a $15 minimum wage push ahead.\nThe state\u2019s minimum wage rose from $9 to $10 at the beginning of the year.\nLos Angeles, San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley already have approved minimum wage hikes to $15 that will phase in, AP reported."}
