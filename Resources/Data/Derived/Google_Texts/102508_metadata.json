CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\n\nThe U.S. government\u2019s funds toward medical research have been declining since 2004, placing the country at a disadvantage to other nations that have been moving forward with research, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).\n\n\u201cThe U.S. position as a global leader in biomedical research is being undermined,\u201d the authors of an accompanying editorial wrote. \u201c[O]ne indicator after another demonstrates numerous other countries outpacing the United States in their commitment to research.\u201d They claimed that the U.S. is losing its competitive edge to other countries \u2014 particularly those in Asia.\n\nUS funding for medical research by source, 1994-2012 American Medical Association\n\nThe researchers found that the rate of U.S. research investment growth increased by six percent every year between 1994 and 2004. But this decreased by 0.8 percent a year from 2004 to 2012. In addition, U.S. contribution to global biomedical research funds fell from 57 percent in 2004 to 44 percent in 2012. Because of this drop in funds, early-stage research hasn\u2019t been receiving enough attention, leaving many promising drugs and ideas behind. In addition, the authors argue that the amount of funding going toward cancer and HIV/AIDS research is larger than is truly needed for these diseases.\n\n\u201cThe diseases where the need is greatest \u2014 autism, depression, Alzheimer\u2019s, type 2 diabetes \u2014 are diseases that have been relatively underfunded compared to cancer and HIV/AIDS,\u201d said Dr. Hamilton Moses, an author of the study and chairman of consulting group Alerion Advisors.\n\nCompounds in development for top 10 therapeutic areas, 2013 American Medical Association\n\nThe researchers aren\u2019t quite sure what has been causing the decline in funding, although it\u2019s likely a number of things. They note:\n\nExpectations for medical research vary sharply, depending on the observer\u2019s perspective. For a patient affected by disease, it is a source of hope. For a parent of a child with a serious condition, it evokes both expectation and frustration over the pace of progress\u2026 For philanthropists and public health campaigners, research represents the best hope for alleviating the world\u2019s most immediate health-related problems. To a scientist, research deepens critical knowledge and the way intelligence and organized effort can improve health. All of these constituents play a role in how research is funded and brought from bench to bedside. Meeting their collective needs produces a complex set of hurdles.\n\nWhile the U.S. still retains its position as leader of biomedical research around the world, the authors argue that in order to maintain that position for much longer, new sources to support medical research must be discovered.\n\n\u201cNew investment is required if the clinical value of past scientific discoveries and opportunities to improve care are to be fully realized,\u201d the authors wrote in their conclusion. They continued, suggesting that \u201csources could include repatriation of foreign capital, new innovation bonds, administrative savings, patent pools, and public-private risk sharing collaborations.\u201d\n\nIndeed, trials for certain drugs and therapies can move pretty quickly if given the right amount of money and attention. For example, an Ebola vaccine or cure had never been developed until the outbreak lit a fire under the government's behind. Because the devastating outbreak captured the world's attention, scientists began scrambling to find a solution. In other words, a sense of urgency is often paramount in pushing things forward much more quickly.\n\n\u201cThe machinery of research and development can move very effectively and you can get to new vaccines and new treatments rather quickly,\u201d Moses said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Asia is investing; Asia knows that biomedical research is a vehicle for them to enhance their international stature and the growth of their own populations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "medical research funding", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new study examines the reasons why U.S. funding toward medical research has been declining significantly for over a decade.", "title": "The US Has Been Behind On Funding Medical Research Since 2004", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/us-medical-research-funding-has-been-declining-significantly-2004-317866", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/14/medical-research-rally.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new study examines the reasons why U.S. funding toward medical research has been declining significantly for over a decade.", "title": "The US Has Been Behind On Funding Medical Research Since 2004", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/us-medical-research-funding-has-been-declining-significantly-2004-317866", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/14/medical-research-rally.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/01/14/medical-research-rally.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Hill", "published_time": "2015-01-14T17:04:19-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-14T17:04:18-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new study examines the reasons why U.S. funding toward medical research has been declining significantly for over a decade."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe04dd\"", "article_summary": "Funding for medical research in the U.S. has declined significantly in the past year, threatening the country's position as the world's leader in biomedical research.\nUS funding for medical research by source, 1994-2012 American Medical AssociationThe researchers found that the rate of U.S. research investment growth increased by six percent every year between 1994 and 2004.\nIn addition, U.S. contribution to global biomedical research funds fell from 57 percent in 2004 to 44 percent in 2012.\nThey note:Expectations for medical research vary sharply, depending on the observer\u2019s perspective.\nCC BY-NC-SA 2.0The U.S. government\u2019s funds toward medical research have been declining since 2004, placing the country at a disadvantage to other nations that have been moving forward with research, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)."}
