Such underinsurance often compromises access to care and financial well-being. In 2014, more than half of all overdue debts on credit reports were related to medical care.\n\nOne of the key cost-containment strategies built into ACA \u2014 the so-called \u201cAccountable Care Organization\u201d strategy \u2014 has encouraged the consolidation of hospitals and physicians\u2019 practices into giant systems with the market leverage to demand higher prices, driving up costs for privately insured Americans.\n\nThere had been considerable hope (or hype) that by simply changing how providers get paid, the ACA would lower health spending and improve quality. In reality, any payment method creates perverse incentives in a market-based system, when increased corporate profit is the central goal, and an ethos of public service is lacking.\n\nMaybe President Obama, and the Democrats in Congress who supported ACA in 2010, meant well. (Or maybe they didn\u2019t.) But one thing is pretty darned clear: the American people had little chance to influence the way Obamacare was structured.\n\nMeanwhile, the medical industry, the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance industry had a great deal of influence, from what I\u2019ve read about the way Washington DC operates.\n\nSomething very different is going on here in Colorado in 2016. A consortium of doctors, nurses, public health professionals and grassroots organizers have petitioned a proposed constitutional amendment onto the November ballot. This citizens\u2019 initiative \u2014 ColoradoCare, Amendment 69 \u2014 seems to have attracted limited support, so far, from big name Colorado politicians.\n\nThe opposition, calling itself \u201cColoradans for Coloradans,\u201d has attracted some huge donations from corporate America, according to the latest campaign finance report filed with the state. In addition to a $500,000 contribution from Anthem (based in Ohio), the opposition has been bankrolled by other industry interests including SCL Health, ($100,000), Washington-based Davita, ($75,000), and Pennsylvania-based Cigna Health and Life Insurance ($40,000).\n\nOne is tempted to wonder about the name, \u201cColoradans for Coloradans.\u201d Perhaps \u201cCorporations for Corporations\u201d would be a more accurate name?\n\nFrom a recent press release from pro-Amendment 69 group ColoradoCareYES:\n\nBy contrast, 99.75% of ColoradoCareYES\u2019s contributions were from individuals, with 94% of the money raised coming from within Colorado. While the opposition may crow about a 7-to-1 advantage in fundraising, ColoradoCareYES is proud to have 40 times as many donations as Coloradans for Coloradans, and an 80-to-1 advantage in contributions from individuals.\n\nBut here\u2019s the point I want to make. Amendment 69 could never happen in Washington DC. for the simple reason that our federal government has no \u201ccitizens initiative\u201d process. Practically speaking: at the federal level, only well-funded, full-time corporate lobbyists have dedicated access to our President and Congressional leaders.\n\nLast week, a petition appeared on the website of the Physicians for a National Health Program, arguing that ACA is a failure, and that only a national single-payer program will be able to solve the social and financial problems inherent in America\u2019s current healthcare system.\n\nAs of last week, the petition had been signed by about 2,300 physicians. The program proposed by the physicians looks remarkably similar to the program that Colorado voters will be voting on in November. You can review the PNHP petition (and sign it, if you wish) at this website.\n\nA short excerpt:\n\nWe propose to replace the ACA with a publicly financed National Health Program (NHP) that would fully cover medical care for all Americans, while lowering costs by eliminating the profit-driven private insurance industry with its massive overhead. Hospitals, nursing homes, and other provider facilities would be nonprofit, and paid global operating budgets rather than fees for each service. Physicians could opt to be paid on a fee-for-service basis, but with fees adjusted to better reward primary care providers, or by salaries in facilities paid by global budgets. The initial increase in government costs would be offset by savings in premiums and out-of-pocket costs, and the rate of medical inflation would slow, freeing up resources for unmet medical and public health needs.\n\nThis is actually not rocket science. Every major industrialized nation \u2014 except the U.S. \u2014 has instituted a universal healthcare system for its citizens, and although every system has its own quirks and problems, every major industrialized nation spends a smaller portion of its GDP on healthcare, while also producing a greater life expectancy than in the U.S. In many cases, per capita healthcare costs are half what we now spend here in America.\n\nFollowing his presentation to the Archuleta Board of County Commissioners last Tuesday, I buttonholed Pagosa Springs Medical Center CEO Brad Cochennet in the parking lot, to ask if he had any sense how ColoradoCare might affect the operations of our local hospital, if the voters were to pass it.\n\nMr. Cochennet admitted that he was no an expert on the topic, but he was able to offer a few comments.\n\n\u201cYou understand the rotation to Medicaid that has happened, from private pay to Medicaid? We went from 8 percent Medicaid to over 20 percent. And we\u2019re better off because of it\u2026 just as a medical provider, in general. If ColoradoCare would pass, and there would be more people with coverage, then in theory we\u2019d be even better off.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so expensive, the way they\u2019ve approached it, I don\u2019t see how it can pass. But it\u2019s getting the idea out there \u2014 that if more people had coverage, and the payments were spread out all across the population, then we\u2019d have enough money to cover people\u2026\u201d\n\nWe discussed a number of the interesting issues raised by Amendment 69, and finally, Brad cocked his head slightly and asked, \u201cDo you think this has a chance of passing?\u201d\n\nI admitted that I think it has a chance.\n\nThe Republic of Colorado has already blazed a voter-approved trail towards sensible, public control of marijuana.\n\nWe could do the same thing with sensible, public control of healthcare costs. If the voters agree.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pagosadailypost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/16LogoPDP_120.jpg"}, "article_summary": "In 2014, more than half of all overdue debts on credit reports were related to medical care.\nA consortium of doctors, nurses, public health professionals and grassroots organizers have petitioned a proposed constitutional amendment onto the November ballot.\nMeanwhile, the medical industry, the pharmaceutical industry and the insurance industry had a great deal of influence, from what I\u2019ve read about the way Washington DC operates.\nIn many cases, per capita healthcare costs are half what we now spend here in America.\nWe could do the same thing with sensible, public control of healthcare costs."}
