Other features inside the exhibit, which will remain open until August, include a Donna the Hippo Memorial and \u201cZoo Directors through the Years.\u201d (AP Photo/The Evansville Courier & Press, James Vaughn) (Photo: JAMES VAUGHN, AP)\n\nMesker Park Zoo\u2019s history hangs from the ceiling and on the walls inside the new Kley Exhibit Hall at Indiana\u2019s oldest zoo on Evansville\u2019s northwest side.\n\nThe book \u201cA Pictorial History of Mesker Park Zoo\u201d comes to life for visitors who venture into the Timeless Treasure exhibit.\n\nAn Evansville Press photo from the 1920s shows Kay, the zoo\u2019s first elephant, being given the \u201croyal welcome.\u201d\n\nPhotos highlighting construction of the zoo\u2019s koi pond follow.\n\nEnter the \u201940s and \u201950s.\n\nThe zoo\u2019s first penguins and Bunny the elephant share that section of the wall.\n\nIn the back left corner of the 4,000-square-foot space, a photo of Bunny standing on its hind legs hangs on the wall.\n\nAmy Schneider\u2019s 4-year-old daughter hopped up on a stepping stool in front of the photo to pose with Bunny.\n\nSchneider snapped a quick shot.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen it a couple of times,\u201d Schneider said about the exhibit. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard with small children to see everything. They get bored and want to move on.\u201d\n\nSchneider and her two daughters spend many weekends at the zoo. \u201cThere\u2019s an educational value to it,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Evansville native tried to remember the first time she visited the zoo. She said it would have been in the early 1980s.\n\n\u201cI was definitely little,\u201d Schneider said. \u201cI remember always liking the monkeys.\u201d\n\nOn the right side of the room, the 1960s and \u201970s take center stage. A few more steps, and the \u201980s and \u201990s section highlights the arrival of giraffes, the Lemur Forest and the zoo\u2019s Discovery Center.\n\nSince 2000, Amazonia opened and a new entrance was constructed.\n\nMarketing Director Abigail Adler said the exhibit, which celebrates the zoo\u2019s 86-year history and provides a glimpse of future plans, drew inspiration from the shared passion of many zoo employees.\n\n\u201cSo far visitors have really enjoyed exploring the exhibit,\u201d Adler said. \u201cFor some, it has been very emotional as it transports them to the zoo of their childhood and memories with loved ones who have passed.\u201d\n\nAnother feature in the exhibit, which will remain open until August, is a Donna the Hippo Memorial. Antiques, such as a machine with a sign that reads: \u201cFeed the animals crackers 25 cents,\u201d rest at the back of the room.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://cjky.it/PwE2E2", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Mesker Park Zoo\u2019s history hangs from the ceiling and on the walls inside the new Kley Exhibit Hall at Indiana\u2019s oldest zoo on Evansville\u2019s northwest side.", "og": {"site_name": "The Courier-Journal", "description": "Mesker Park Zoo\u2019s history hangs from the ceiling and on the walls inside the new Kley Exhibit Hall at Indiana\u2019s oldest zoo on Evansville\u2019s northwest side.", "title": "Evansville zoo exhibit takes look to the past", "url": "http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/indiana/2014/04/05/evansville-zoo-exhibit-takes-look-past/7347009/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/courier-journal.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mesker Park Zoo\u2019s history hangs from the ceiling and on the walls inside the new Kley Exhibit Hall at Indiana\u2019s oldest zoo on Evansville\u2019s northwest side.", "title": "Evansville zoo exhibit takes look to the past", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cf45956edb7d1d5a84249b4cc5d95a4eca2fb704/c=0-256-1536-1792&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/05/exchangeevansvillezoohistory2.jpg", "creator": "@courierjournal", "site": "@courierjournal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600030236", "fb": {"app_id": 128534137209813}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Geography/Evansville", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Geography/Evansville", "title": "Evansville zoo exhibit takes look to the past", "author": "James Vaughn", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "news/local/indiana", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ac138ae3e5d56d378a81ec1264d6a985fa02c339/c=0-0-1536-2048/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/05/exchangeevansvillezoohistory2.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0e67cc7fcb36a41489d948cf4d9a1975b36d6356/c=0-256-1536-1792/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/05/exchangeevansvillezoohistory2.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ed39e1395d05b2665f9dde8ff1568b7bc506f816/c=0-448-1536-1600/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/05/exchangeevansvillezoohistory2.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d9724d91d56520faa86d74181f6daaaa19f69d19/c=0-592-1536-1456&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/05/exchangeevansvillezoohistory2.jpg", "publishtime": "2014-04-05T11:40:00-04:00", "shorthed": "Evansville zoo exhibit takes look to the past", "articleid": 7347009, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aa29b2361d453f11ba3fa8fc7715334a893da550/c=0-592-1536-1456/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/05/exchangeevansvillezoohistory2.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5edd3a5126994de671c37ba75908ae7d46fd545c/c=192-0-1344-2048/local/-/media/Louisville/2014/04/05/exchangeevansvillezoohistory2.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": ""}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab0f\"", "article_summary": "Mesker Park's history hangs from the ceiling and on the walls inside the new Kley Exhibit Hall at Indiana's oldest zoo in Evansville, Ind.\nThe book \u201cA Pictorial History of Mesker Park Zoo\u201d comes to life for visitors who venture into the Timeless Treasure exhibit.\n\u201cSo far visitors have really enjoyed exploring the exhibit,\u201d Adler said.\nThe Evansville native tried to remember the first time she visited the zoo.\nMarketing Director Abigail Adler said the Timeless Treasure exhibit celebrates the zoo\u2019s 86 year history and provides a glimpse of future plans, drew inspiration from the shared passion of many zoo employees."}
