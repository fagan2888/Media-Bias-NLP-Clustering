But on average, women are still earning just 77 cents on every dollar that a man does. Women with college degrees may earn hundreds of thousands of dollars less over the course of her career than a man at the same educational level. And that\u2019s wrong. This isn\u2019t 1958, it\u2019s 2014. That\u2019s why the first bill I signed into law was called the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \u2014 and it made sure that it was easier for women to sue if they weren\u2019t being paid the same as men.\n\nAnd in the coming weeks, Congress will have a chance to go even further by voting yes or no on what\u2019s called the Paycheck Fairness Act. Right now, a majority of the senators support that bill but so far Republicans have blocked it. We\u2019ve got to get them to change their minds and join us in this century \u2014 because a woman deserves equal pay for equal work. It\u2019s pretty straightforward.\n\nAnd Congress should not stop there. A woman deserves workplace policies that protect her right to have a baby without losing her job. It\u2019s pretty clear that if men were having babies \u2014 we\u2019d have different policies. I mean, we know that, that\u2019s for certain. A woman deserves to take a day off to care for a sick child or a parent without running into hardship.\n\nSo Congress needs to act so that Americans join every other advanced nation on Earth by offering paid leave to folks who work hard every day. It\u2019s time to do away with some of these workplace policies that belong in a \u201cMad Men\u201d episode. We\u2019ve got to make sure that every woman has the opportunities that she deserves \u2014 because when women succeed, America succeeds. I truly believe that.\n\n\u2026.\n\nAnd in the roundtable I just had there were at least three or four folks in that roundtable, the majority of the women I just talked to had an instance in their lives where either because of a sick child or a premature baby or an ailing parent, they would be bankrupt had they not had health insurance. Broke. So when you hear folks talking about Obamacare and I\u2019m not using it because I\u2019ve got health insurance or I\u2019m healthy, well, yes, you don\u2019t need health insurance until you need health insurance. It seems like a drag until you actually confront what life does to all of us at some point. Some unexpected thing happens and you want to make sure that you\u2019ve got that support.\n\nNow, none of that has stopped Republicans in Congress from spending the last few years not focused on legislation to create jobs, or raise wages, or help more young people afford college. They\u2019ve taken 50 votes to try to repeal or undermine this law \u2014 50. You know what they say \u2014 the 50th time is the charm. Fifty times. And it\u2019s not just to try to improve the law or here\u2019s a particular problem. No, we just want to scrap it so that millions of people who now have health insurance, we want them to go back to not having health insurance.\n\nWell, that\u2019s not going to happen. They can keep wasting their time repealing \u2014 trying to repeal the ACA; we\u2019re going to keep working to make this law work better because every person and every woman deserves to control her own health care choices \u2014 not her boss, not her insurer, surely not Congress.\n\nPresident Obama was on quite a roll. In the same twenty plus minute speech, he drilled Republicans for opposing equal pay, and he pointed out what a giant waste of time their fifty odd attempts to repeal Obamacare is. The two issues are related. The Republican agenda involves both controlling women in the workplace and in the doctor\u2019s office.\n\nThe president was correct. Soon the majority of America\u2019s highly educated workforce will be women, and these women deserve equal pay for equal work. All women deserve not to have their gender use as an excuse for discrimination.\n\nIt\u2019s about more than politics. The fundamental question is will the United States be a 21st Century nation, or will Republicans be allowed to drag us back to the 19th or 20th centuries? While Republicans are trapped in the past, Obama and the Democrats have a vision for the future of this country. That future involves a path to universal access to healthcare, and equal pay for women.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In Florida today, President Obama dropped the queen mother of all truth bombs on the Republicans, as the president wiped the floor with the GOP for opposing equal pay for women, and for having wasted the country's time on 50 attempts to repeal the ACA.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "In Florida today, President Obama dropped the queen mother of all truth bombs on the Republicans, as the president wiped the floor with the GOP for opposing equal pay for women, and for having wasted the country's time on 50 attempts to repeal the ACA.", "title": "Obama Obliterates Republicans With a Sunshine State Equal Pay and ACA Truth Bomb", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2014/03/20/obama-obliterates-republicans-sunshine-state-equal-pay-aca-truth-bomb.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/obama-fl-women-min-wage.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-03-20T17:59:50+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "obama,florida,obama speech Valencia College,equal pay,aca repeal,Valencia College,Featured News,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Featured News", "published_time": "2014-03-20T17:59:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-03-20T17:59:50+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5dd\"", "article_summary": "So when you hear folks talking about Obamacare and I\u2019m not using it because I\u2019ve got health insurance or I\u2019m healthy, well, yes, you don\u2019t need health insurance until you need health insurance.\nSoon the majority of America\u2019s highly educated workforce will be women, and these women deserve equal pay for equal work.\nWe\u2019ve got to get them to change their minds and join us in this century \u2014 because a woman deserves equal pay for equal work.\nNo, we just want to scrap it so that millions of people who now have health insurance, we want them to go back to not having health insurance.\nThat future involves a path to universal access to healthcare, and equal pay for women."}
