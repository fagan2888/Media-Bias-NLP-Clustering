After beating Colorado in five sets Saturday to win the four-team NCAA sub-regional at Moby Arena, the Colorado State Rams are in the sweet 16 and headed to Minneapolis for next weekend’s regional.

The Rams, now 31-2, won 25-22, 25-21, 23-25, 24-26, 16-14.

Rams senior outside hitter Marlee Reynolds had 18 kills.

I wasn’t at the match, so these quotes are courtesy of the CSU sports information department.

“It’s just incredible,” Reynolds said. “That fifth set, I was looking around and … it was awesome. Just seeing Moby packed like that, they’re the reason we won this game. They were behind us 110 percent. It was incredible.”

She added of her match, “I think it’s just something that flowed tonight. I just kind of went out there and was pretty relaxed and played with freedom, and I knew we had nothing to lose so I might as well just take some cracks at the ball and see what happens. And good things happened.”

CSU coach Tom Hilbert called it a “fantastic match in front of an unbelievable crowd in a great venue. This is what college sports is supposed to be like. I am glad we are able to take the sport of volleyball and put it in that arena (with) that type of event. It was amazing. … This has been the happiest and greatest match I have been a part of in 18 years here at CSU. It was a big moment for CSU, volleyball, and the state of Colorado.”

CU coach Liz Kritza said of the Buffs’ comeback: “They are winners, they have guts, and steel in their spine. They simply refused to just let it go. We didn’t play our best volleyball today, and we are honest with each other and we didn’t.”

The appearance in the Sweet 16 will be the 10th for the Rams, and they’ll meet Texas on Friday.
