But on the Affordable Care Act, her embrace was more flexible than dogmatic. Clinton said that she wanted to \u201ckeep what works\u201d but that she was open to changes, including the Republican idea of allowing insurance companies to compete across state lines.\n\nClinton\u2019s opening act is a listening tour through the early primary and caucus states, and aides said she does not plan to start rolling out a detailed policy agenda until late spring or summer, but her Iowa swing offered a preview of what is to come.\n\nWith crowds of supporters waiting for her, Hillary Rodham Clinton stopped at a coffee house in Mount Vernon, Iowa. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nRhetorically, Clinton is offering herself as a champion of everyday Americans at a time of economic renewal. But with deep anxiety coursing through the nation, she also is trying to channel voters\u2019 desire for change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out in our country how to get back on the right track,\u201d Clinton told a group of students and educators Tuesday in rural Monticello.\n\nAfter chatting in a Le Claire coffee shop with a college student who is spiralling into debt, Clinton lamented, \u201cPeople are struggling.\u201d\n\nAnd the next day in Norwalk, Clinton told small-business owners that although the economy had bounced back, \u201cWe need to do more than just get by. We need to get ahead and stay ahead.\u201d\n\nSo far, Clinton has not pointed fingers at Obama. In fact, during a private meeting with local Democratic leaders in Mount Vernon, she likened the Obama recovery to the booming economy during husband Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency to draw a favorable contrast to what she considered the poor economic records of the past few Republican presidents, according to one attendee.\n\nHowever, Clinton did say she wanted to change the tenor in Washington, making a subtle contrast with Obama\u2019s leadership style.\n\n\u201cI want to get things done,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI\u2019m willing to work with people who have good ideas, who are on any side of the political divide, but we have to start breaking down the divisions that have paralyzed our politics.\u201d\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton listens to small-business owners during a roundtable discussion at Capitol City Fruit in Norwalk, Iowa. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nTo that end, she advocated getting rid of \u201cunaccountable money\u201d in political campaigns, even if does so requires a constitutional amendment.\n\nObama\u2019s unpopularity as well as history \u2014 only once in the past half century has a two-term president been succeeded by a candidate from the same party, President George H.W. Bush in 1989 \u2014 might persuade Clinton to break with the president. But she and her campaign advisers have decided to stand by Obama \u2014 in part out of necessity, considering she served as his first-term secretary of state.\n\nClinton\u2019s loyalty to the president she once served will be tested once she reveals a robust menu of specific ideas that inevitably will draw some distinctions with the president\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cEven if politicians try very hard to imitate others, they\u2019re going to fail because they have their own outlook and their own approaches, and I\u2019m quite sure that she does,\u201d said William A. Galston, a former Clinton White House policy adviser and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nClinton signaled that health care could be one such area of differentiation. She defended the Affordable Care Act but left an opening to prescribe her own changes to the law. \u201cPart of what I\u2019ll be doing during the campaign is looking for ways that we keep what works . . . [but] figure out how we fill all these gaps,\u201d she said Wednesday in Norwalk.\n\nClinton said she was considering a proposal that would allow insurance companies to compete across state lines. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to have a free-market system, then we need a free market where we\u2019ve got people competing on costs and quality,\u201d she said.\n\nHearing that, Galston said, \u201cI nearly fell out of my seat. I was surprised, because that has been an important plank of the Republican approach from the very beginning.\u201d He said this was \u201ca very prudent course,\u201d because it signals to congressional Republicans that she is open to their ideas.\n\nAndy Stern, a former Service Employees International Union president, said Clinton has come out with \u201ca seemingly strong declaration that she\u2019s for Main Street.\u201d He singled out her support for free community college for qualified students, an Obama priority.\n\n\u201cThe thematics are impressive and pretty clean. The policies and the people will tell the next chapters of the story,\u201d Stern said. He said he wants to see whether Clinton is open to fresh, progressive thinking or whether the centrist economists from her husband\u2019s administration will have her ear.\n\nClinton is likely to flesh out some foreign policy differences with Obama. She has said that in 2012 she advocated arming rebels in Syria fighting in the civil war there and that Obama decided not to heed her advice. The president eventually took that action, but not until after Clinton had left office and the war had escalated.\n\nOn Iran, the nuclear negotiations that are a pillar of Obama\u2019s foreign policy record were set in motion on Clinton\u2019s watch. She publicly supported the negotiations but also voiced strong skepticism that Iran could either make or honor an acceptable deal.\n\nClinton is in what aides call a \u201cramp-up phase,\u201d road-testing only broad policy themes, which gives her campaign policy team, led by Maya Harris, Ann O\u2019Leary and Jake Sullivan, time to craft detailed proposals.\n\nA proud policy wonk throughout her life, Clinton spent considerable time pondering an agenda before deciding to run. Last fall, Sullivan led a thorough review of big challenges and potential policy solutions. The result was a 500-page briefing book, which Clinton took with her on Christmas vacation in the Dominican Republic.\n\nBut Clinton is sensitive to being accused of pronouncing policy from on high, so she is first absorbing input from citizens she encounters on the campaign trail, according to people familiar with the campaign.\n\nFor instance, one of these people said, Clinton was struck after several discussions during her first day in Iowa that nobody asked her about income inequality, the economic issue du jour among political elites and a core theme of her nascent campaign.\n\nIn her campaign announcement video, Clinton says, \u201cThe deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top.\u201d It\u2019s a line she repeated across Iowa.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong when CEOs make 300 times more than the typical worker,\u201d Clinton said in Monticello. Referencing her road trip into Iowa, Clinton added, \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong when hedge fund managers pay lower tax rates than nurses or the truckers that I saw on I-80 as I was driving here over the last two days.\u201d\n\nDavid Axelrod, a former Obama strategist, said this is the tension that will shape the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cPlainly, the economic issue of our day is how the 21st century could regenerate a strong, thriving, secure middle class; how we create more economic mobility so that if you work hard you could actually get ahead; how do we do things that reduce the huge polarity in our economy?\u201d he said. \u201cThat requires a real plan. That requires ideas. How she approaches that is absolutely essential.\u201d\n\nDan Balz and Anne Gearan contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "She ventured into new territory on campaign finance and regulation, and expressed flexibility on health care.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PhilipRuckerWP", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "She ventured into new territory on campaign finance and regulation, and expressed flexibility on health care.", "title": "What Hillary Clinton\u2019s debut on the trail reveals about her policy agenda", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-hillary-clintons-week-on-the-trail-reveals-about-her-policy-agenda/2015/04/16/1ff1edba-e458-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/04/15/Others/Images/2015-04-15/__%20h%2091429130115.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PhilipRucker"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/what-hillary-clintons-week-on-the-trail-reveals-about-her-policy-agenda/2015/04/16/1ff1edba-e458-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Hillary Clinton policy, clinton policy, hillary policy, hillary clinton policy agenda, clinton policy agenda, clinton healthcare, hillary healthcare", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/PhilipRuckerWP"}, "eomportal-uuid": "1ff1edba-e458-11e4-b510-962fcfabc310", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Hillary Clinton policy, clinton policy, hillary policy, hillary clinton policy agenda, clinton policy agenda, clinton healthcare, hillary healthcare"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdadbb\"", "article_summary": "Pastor Traci Blackmon prays as Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton listens at Christ the King United Church of Christ in Florissant, Mo, near Ferguson.\nWith crowds of supporters waiting for her, Hillary Rodham Clinton stopped at a coffee house in Mount Vernon, Iowa.\nJune 23, 2015 Pastor Traci Blackmon prays as Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton listens at Christ the King United Church of Christ in Florissant, Mo, near Ferguson.\nWhitney Curtis/Getty ImagesThe newly official 2016 presidential candidate hits the road in Iowa on a campaign kickoff tour.\nThe newly official 2016 presidential candidate hits the road in Iowa on a campaign kickoff tour."}
