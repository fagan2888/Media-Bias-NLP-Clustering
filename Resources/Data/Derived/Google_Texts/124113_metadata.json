But insurers say a mix of state laws governing nurses\u2019 ability to practice independently complicates such efforts. They say they have taken other steps to expand primary care services, often using nurse practitioners in \u201cmedical homes,\u201d where doctors, nurses and other professionals work together to provide care.\n\n\u201cWe think the future is in the coordination of team-based care,\u201d said Alissa Fox, senior vice president of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association. \u201cAnd nurses are a key part of the team.\u201d\n\nPhysician groups, which have often opposed nurse practitioners\u2019 efforts to operate independently, question whether allowing nurses to bill insurers directly would increase access to primary care.\n\nThe ANA argues that insurers selling plans in the new marketplaces should be required to credential a minimum number of advanced practice nurses. Under its recommendation, insurers would need to include as few as 20 nurse practitioners in some states and more than 600 in others.\n\nThe group submitted its recommendation in July as part of formal comments on proposed health law rules that the Obama administration is expected to finalize later this year. An administration official declined to comment.\n\nClare Krusing, a spokeswoman for America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, wouldn\u2019t comment directly on the recommendation, but noted the percentage of HMOs that credential nurses is rising, \u201ca reflection that new models of care are being implemented.\u201d\n\nCredentialing Is New Strategy\n\nThe focus on credentialing is the latest strategy in a long running battle by nurse practitioners, marked mainly by efforts to expand their authority under state law to provide care without direct physician oversight. In 2010, the Institute of Medicine endorsed such efforts, urging state and federal regulators to remove barriers so nurse practitioners can make full use of their training, which includes instruction on examining, diagnosing and treating patients.\n\nA National Governors Association report in 2012 made similar suggestions and noted that studies showed nurse practitioners provided care comparable to physicians.\n\nControversy has continued, however. While proponents say nurse practitioners can perform many of the primary care services that physicians do \u2014 and at lower cost \u2014 doctor groups say they should do so only as part of doctor-led teams. They also question whether the approach would increase access to primary care.\n\n\u201cAbsent that team approach, patients will be at serious risk,\u201d Paul R. Phinney, president of the California Medical Association, said in a statement opposing a bill that would expand nurse autonomy. \u201cIn California, where we already have integrated medical teams in many areas, removing nurse practitioners to set up shop elsewhere will only create a new access problem where one does not currently exist.\u201d\n\nNevada was the latest state to allow nurse practitioners to hang out their own shingles, with Gov. Brian Sandoval signing a bill in June. Still, in most states, nurse practitioners require collaborative arrangements with physicians for oversight of their diagnoses and treatment, according to a report by researchers at the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan research group in Washington.\n\nWhile each state has its own licensing and certification criteria, advanced practice nurses generally can diagnose and manage common illnesses such as strep throat, order tests and give patients prescriptions for medications. Those specially certified can administer anesthesia.\n\nSuch laws generally do not specify exactly what tasks nurse practitioners can perform, but \u201cauthorize a broad range of practice and spell out whether or not physician supervision is required to carry out tasks,\u201d the report says.\n\nShortage of Primary Care Docs\n\nWith up to 30 million Americans expected to gain coverage through private insurance and Medicaid in the next decade, a projected shortage of primary care physicians is leading to questions about who will care for all the new patients. Because nurse practitioners undergo a shorter training time \u2014 a master\u2019s degree program after becoming an RN, plus up to 700 hours of supervised clinical experience \u2014 their numbers can be increased more quickly than physicians.\n\nCurrently, about 250,000 advanced practice nurses, including nurse practitioners, midwives and anesthetists, are licensed nationwide, according to the ANA. About 6,000 nurse practitioners run their own offices, according to the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP). The U.S. Department of Labor says about half of the nation\u2019s nurse practitioners work in physician practices.\n\nMore nurse practitioners would go into business for themselves if insurers included them in their networks and they could bill directly, said Deanna Tolman, an advanced practice nurse who opened her own office several years ago in Aurora, a suburb of Denver.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in this gray area: Insurers are fine with us providing care as long as we\u2019re working for physicians. But some of us don\u2019t want to work for physicians,\u201d said Tolman.\n\nJerry Driscoll, a Philadelphia-area nurse practitioner, for instance, runs an agency that delivers primary care to 1,000 patients in their homes. But since he is not credentialed by several of the state\u2019s major insurers, his company must bill through physicians with whom he has collaborative agreements. In addition, \u201cpeople can\u2019t find my name or the name of my company\u201d in insurers\u2019 providers\u2019 lists, he said.\n\nOpposition From Doctors\u2019 Groups\n\nCredentialing policies vary. While nurse practitioners may be included in an insurer\u2019s network \u2014 allowing patients access \u2014 they might not be credentialed. Researchers said that insurers may be hesitant to credential more nurse practitioners because of the paperwork burden or because of the mix of state rules governing nurse autonomy.\n\nPhysician concerns are also part of the mix.\n\n\u201cThere are longstanding debates between physicians and nurse practitioners about the clinical roles of each,\u201d said Alwyn Cassil, a spokeswoman for the Center for Studying Health System Change. \u201cAside from those clinical issues, there isn\u2019t any denying there are economic issues on the table as well that revolve around nurse practitioners being able to bill independently of physicians.\u201d\n\nNurse practitioners say some insurers sign them up no matter where their offices are located, while others do so only in rural areas and places where primary care physicians are in short supply.\n\nIn Massachusetts, which in 2006 became the first state to require residents to have insurance, demand for medical care rose after the law\u2019s passage. Responding to that, Massachusetts lawmakers required insurers to recognize nurse practitioners as primary care providers, among other changes.\n\nBut insurers \u201ccan still write a policy that makes it difficult,\u201d said Nancy O\u2019Rourke, a regional director for the American Association of Nurse Practitioners. Even though the number of nurse practitioners in the state has grown by a few hundred to about 6,000 since the law\u2019s passage, the state\u2019s major insurers have credentialed very few, she said.\n\nBlue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts said it has about 3,200 nurse practitioners in its network, but fewer than 100 are credentialed as primary care providers.\n\nAbout 74 percent of 258 large HMOs nationwide said they credential nurse practitioners as primary care providers, according to a 2012 study by the national Nursing Centers Consortium, which advocates for independent practice nursing. That was an increase from 53 percent of those surveyed in 2007. While the sample included HMOS with the largest enrollment in each state, it didn\u2019t include all HMOs or other forms of insurance policies, such as preferred provider organizations (PPOs).\n\nNurse advocates are encouraged, but not satisfied.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made progress, but we\u2019re not there,\u201d said Tay Kopanos, vice president for state policy at the American Association of Nurse Practitioners.\n\n[Image from Lower Columbia College]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nurse practitioners say efforts to expand primary care to millions of Americans under the health law are hampered by insurance industry practices that limit or exclude their participation.\r\nDespite laws in 17 states and the District of Columbia allowing...", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Nurse practitioners say efforts to expand primary care to millions of Americans under the health law are hampered by insurance industry practices that limit or exclude their participation.\r\nDespite laws in 17 states and the District of Columbia allowing...", "title": "Nurse practitioners lobby for guaranteed participation in health insurance marketplaces", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/4473159343_901ba0ef6d.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-08-07T18:23:31-04:00", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2013/09/nurse-practitioners-lobby-for-guaranteed-participation-in-health-insurance-marketplaces/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/4473159343_901ba0ef6d.jpg", "description": "Nurse practitioners say efforts to expand primary care to millions of Americans under the health law are hampered by insurance industry practices that limit or exclude their participation.\r\nDespite laws in 17 states and the District of Columbia allowing...", "card": "summary", "title": "Nurse practitioners lobby for guaranteed participation in health insurance marketplaces - MedCity News"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,doctors, health insurance exchange, health insurance marketplace, how to become a nurse, insurance, nurse practitioner, nurses, Nursing, Obamacare, payers, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Hospitals", "tag": "payers", "published_time": "2013-09-09T07:55:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-07T18:23:31-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf33\"", "article_summary": "About 6,000 nurse practitioners run their own offices, according to the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP).\nNurse practitioners say efforts to expand primary care to millions of Americans under the health law are hampered by insurance industry practices that limit or exclude their participation.\nCurrently, about 250,000 advanced practice nurses, including nurse practitioners, midwives and anesthetists, are licensed nationwide, according to the ANA.\nThe U.S. Department of Labor says about half of the nation\u2019s nurse practitioners work in physician practices.\nResponding to that, Massachusetts lawmakers required insurers to recognize nurse practitioners as primary care providers, among other changes."}
