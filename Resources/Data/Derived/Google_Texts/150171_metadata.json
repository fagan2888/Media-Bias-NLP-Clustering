In 2013, he led the charge on a patent reform bill, and more recently, he\u2019s quietly pushed for tax changes that favor the tech industry. No surprise, then, that ITIC \u2013 whose member companies include Facebook, HP, Google and Intel \u2013 voted McCarthy \u201cLegislator of the Year\u201d in 2012.\n\nWhen McCarthy was majority whip, he was responsible for counting votes for the GOP leadership. Now, as majority leader, his key role will be in setting such priorities as the House floor vote schedule.\n\nRelated: New House Leaders Primed for Internal Power Struggles\n\nThe son of a firefighter and first Republican in his immediate family, McCarthy has long advocated for a business environment that gives entrepreneurs the freedom to both fail and take risks. \u201cAs we see entrepreneurs such as Burt Rutan and Richard Branson dare to achieve the unthinkable, we must ensure that they have the freedom to innovate and create without government making their lives more difficult,\u201d McCarthy wrote in a 2013 pp-ed. \u201cWe need to simplify the lives of our innovators so they can focus on pushing the envelope, and not on pushing endless streams of paperwork from Sacramento and Washington bureaucracies.\u201d\n\nTech industry insiders stress the importance of McCarthy\u2019s work to bridge the gap between congressional leaders and industry leaders. Dubbing his Rayburn office a \u201cstartup for ideas,\u201d he is the only member of the House leadership to have a member of his team 100 percent dedicated to coalitions, a position currently held by Danielle Burr.\n\nThe position was previously held by Brian Worth, who served as McCarthy\u2019s director of coalitions for more than three years before leaving in May to take a job as Uber\u2019s federal public policy lead. As the National Journal reported, Worth was the lead on a series of meetings designed to get key business lobbying groups \u2013 such as the National Federation of Independent Business, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Boeing \u2013 to support extending the Bush tax cuts.\n\nIn 2013, McCarthy led a delegation of House Republicans on an \u201cInnovate to Create\u201d tour of Silicon Valley. Visiting startups and entrepreneurs, the team got a crash course of sorts on how innovation leads to American job creation and economic growth.\n\nRelated: Mark Cuban on How Obamacare Could Help Startups\n\n\u201cSilicon Valley is the cradle of twenty-first century innovation and the home to businesses that have effectively harnessed the entrepreneurial spirit that has made this country so great,\u201d McCarthy said in a statement about the California junket.\n\n\u201cWashington must be mindful of the impact its policies have in either fostering or hindering this growth. House Republicans are committed to unshackling entrepreneurs from onerous government-manufactured burdens that threaten to dampen opportunities for development so that there are no limits to what America\u2019s innovators can imagine for our future.\u201d\n\nGoogle, Facebook, the Internet Association Roundtable, and Good Technology were among several stops on the tech tour, as Politico reported. The group also paid a visit to Engine Advocacy, a group dedicated to getting \"tech startups, entrepreneurs and technologists\" involved in public policy.\n\n\u201cHe understands our industry and has been very proactive in reaching out to us to learn what we think,\u201d said Halataei of ITIC.\n\nMcCarthy even knows about using social media \u2013 Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, YouTube, Instagram \u2013 to communicate his priorities and make connections. He even applies the \u201call politics is local\u201d rule to his state and his diet: Check out his Instagram feed for a glimpse of his \u201cdouble double time\u201d at In-N-Out Burger.\n\nRelated: LinkedIn Data Reveals the Most \u2018InDemand\u2019 Employers\n\n\u201cRep. McCarthy has his finger on the pulse of Silicon Valley. He intuitively understands the industry\u2019s culture of innovation and knows what\u2019s needed to protect it,\u201d said Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s vice president of U.S. Public Policy. \u201cHe is also an early adopter of technology in both his professional and personal life, and there\u2019s no better way to understand the Valley\u2019s unique contributions to the economy.\u201d\n\nPerhaps there\u2019s also no better way to earn the Valley\u2019s financial backing, although McCarthy is hardly the only congressperson they\u2019ve supported. According to OpenSecret.com, Larry Ellison, founder and CEO of Oracle, contributed $31,500 to McCarthy\u2019s campaign and leadership PAC during the 2012 campaign cycle, and another $7,500 in 2014. Google pitched in $20,000 in 2012 and another $10,000 to his Leadership PAC in 2014. Microsoft gave $17,500 in 2012 and another $5,000 to his Leadership PAC in 2014. Salesforce.com, a global cloud computing company headquartered in San Francisco, gave $9,000 to McCarthy\u2019s campaign committee in 2014.\n\nTech friends of McCarthy\u2019s are optimistic about future legislative goals. \u201cHe\u2019s coming in with the knowledge base of what the tech community needs to grow jobs,\u201d Halataei said. \u201cWe have [more] priorities as an industry that we hope the House will move on by the end of the year,\u201d he said, citing the trade agenda and tax extensions.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As Congressman Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) climbed the House leadership ladder to majority l", "title": "With McCarthy\u2019s Rise, Tech Sector Gets a Boost", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/22/McCarthy-s-Rise-Tech-Sector-Gets-Boost", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06192014_Kevin_Mccarthy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/22/McCarthy-s-Rise-Tech-Sector-Gets-Boost", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/06192014_Kevin_Mccarthy.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As Congressman Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) climbed the House leadership ladder to majority l", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "In 2013, he led the charge on a patent reform bill, and more recently, he\u2019s quietly pushed for tax changes that favor the tech industry.\nAs Congressman Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) climbed the House leadership ladder to majority leader this past week, the tech world ascended with him.\nTech friends of McCarthy\u2019s are optimistic about future legislative goals.\nThe group also paid a visit to Engine Advocacy, a group dedicated to getting \"tech startups, entrepreneurs and technologists\" involved in public policy.\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming in with the knowledge base of what the tech community needs to grow jobs,\u201d Halataei said."}
