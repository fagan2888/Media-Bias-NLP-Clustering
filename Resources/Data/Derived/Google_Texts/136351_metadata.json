My name is Gus Bilirakis. I serve as Vice-Chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee. And I represent the people of Florida\u2019s 12th Congressional District.\n\nToday, on behalf of my constituents and behalf of all Republicans, I would like to deliver a message directly to America\u2019s veterans, our true American heroes:\n\nAmerica is what she is because of you. We are free because of you. You have borne the battle, and we have vowed to take care of you and yours.\n\nI only wish that your government always lived up to this promise. It has been nearly two years since VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned amid a series of scandals. At the time, the president said\u2014and I quote\u2014\u2019the number one priority is making sure that problems get fixed.\u2019\n\nBut problems have not been fixed, and it\u2019s not clear whether it\u2019s a priority for this administration.\n\nDespite receiving more funding, the VA is still taking too long to process claims. Wait times are actually worse.\n\nDespite receiving more authority to clean up the bureaucracy, the VA has held almost no one accountable for manipulating wait times. Meanwhile, some of the same people responsible for these problems received bonuses as if nothing happened. That\u2019s unacceptable as far as I\u2019m concerned.\n\nTo you, these are life and death issues. But too often at the VA, it is business as usual.\n\nWe cannot accept that. That\u2019s why, in recent months, the House and Senate have been working on reforms to boost accountability and improve care. Just last week, the House passed legislation\u2014bipartisan legislation, by the way\u2014to address the drug addiction problem that is so prevalent among our veterans.\n\nAnd this week, the House passed legislation that funds the VA. In it, we have used our constitutional authority to hold the VA accountable. That means making the VA meet requirements for improving electronic health records. It means adding hundreds of new employees to tackle claims appeals. And it means prohibiting all VA Senior Executive Service Managers from receiving bonuses.\n\nBecause we can\u2019t throw money at the problem all the time, ok? It won\u2019t go away just doing that. We need real and meaningful reforms at the VA.\n\nAnd we need President Obama to keep his word to you, and make it his top priority to fix the problems at the VA.\n\nWe will not rest until he does.\n\nThat\u2019s the least we can do.\n\nThank you for listening, and thank you for your service to this great country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "GOP Rep Bilirakis: VA 'Wait Times Are Actually Worse,' 'Has Held Almost No One Accountable'", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "GOP Rep Bilirakis: VA 'Wait Times Are Actually Worse,' 'Has Held Almost No One Accountable'", "title": "GOP Rep Bilirakis: VA 'Wait Times Are Actually Worse,' 'Has Held Almost No One Accountable' - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Bilirakis-521-Thumbnail.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2016-05-21T08:33:40-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2016/05/21/gop-rep-bilirakis-va-wait-times-are-actually-worse-vahas-held-almost-no-one-accountable/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GOP Rep Bilirakis: VA 'Wait Times Are Actually Worse,' 'Has Held Almost No One Accountable'", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/05/Bilirakis-521-Thumbnail.jpg", "title": "GOP Rep Bilirakis: VA 'Wait Times Are Actually Worse,' 'Has Held Almost No One Accountable' - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Gus Bilirakis, VA, veterans, Veterans Affairs,Breitbart TV,VA", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2016-05-21T08:05:18-07:00", "section": "Breitbart TV", "modified_time": "2016-05-21T08:33:40-07:00", "tag": "Veterans Affairs", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Representative Gus Bilirakis (R-FL) stated that the VA\u2019s wait times have gotten worse \u201cthe VA has held almost no one accountable for manipulating wait times.\nDespite receiving more authority to clean up the bureaucracy, the VA has held almost no one accountable for manipulating wait times.\nWait times are actually worse.\nIn it, we have used our constitutional authority to hold the VA accountable.\nMeanwhile, some of the same people responsible for these problems received bonuses as if nothing happened\u201d and during Saturday\u2019s GOP Weekly Address."}
