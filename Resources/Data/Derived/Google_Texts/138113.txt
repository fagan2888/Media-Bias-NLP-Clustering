Former Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating says he is considering a run to replace Sen. Tom Coburn, whose term ends in 2016, Politico reports.

Coburn announced last week, in the midst of his newest cancer diagnosis, that he will not be seeking re-election. The senior Republican has served in the U.S. Senate since 2005 after spending six years in the U.S. House of Representatives.

Keating, a former two-term Republican governor of the Sooner State (1995-2003), now serves as president and CEO of the American Bankers Association.

POLITICO quoted him as saying, "I've had a number of people call me to encourage me, and at this stage, I'm just watching to see how things evolve. I've not decided 100 percent no or 100 percent yes."

Four days after Coburn announced he was stepping down, U.S. Rep. James Lankford (R-Oklahoma) threw hit hat in the ring. He is the first to officially announce his candidacy.

Names rumored to be considering a run include T.W. Shannon, J.C. Watts and Kenneth Corn.

Coburn, who has built his reputation as a staunch fiscal conservative, requested that Gov. Mary Fallin hold the special election on the same dates as the state's scheduled elections, so taxpayer money would be spent at a minimum.
