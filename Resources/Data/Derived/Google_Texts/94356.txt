Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, attempting to cope with what he says is a growing mental health crisis among inmates at the county jail, said up to 9,000 people who have been incarcerated have signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act in an attempt to get the care they need.

“Systemically, over the course of decades, we’ve sort of carved back all the mental health services to the point where there is this question, we’ve carved it back to next to nothing,” Dart said on “The Sunday Spin” on WGN AM-720.

The sheriff said that the process of closing mental health institutions under the goal of putting the mentally ill into community-based treatment has led to 3,000 of the jail’s 10,000 inmates requiring treatment. As a result, he said, costs have increased and jail staff has undergone greater training.

Dart said the Cook County Jail is now the largest mental health provider in the state and perhaps the largest in the country. He said he is traveling next month to accept an award from the National Alliance on Mental Illness for trying to cope with the problem. But "it’s not a good thing, not a good thing at all. And this is truly a national issue, a national problem,” Dart said.

He said the closure of community-based mental health facilities has led to a criminalization of the illness, with incarceration costs far in excess of what medical treatment would cost.

Through the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare as the president’s signature health care coverage law is known, Dart said enrollees now “have the ability to at least have care paid for -- if they can find it someplace that’s still open. But that’s the big problem, to find a place that’s still open.”
