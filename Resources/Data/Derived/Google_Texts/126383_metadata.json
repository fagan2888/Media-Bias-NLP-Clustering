That is, until a television commercial at the bar where Charmaine works seems to speak directly to her about another way to live.\n\nLess venturesome sci-fi than Atwood\u2019s recent MaddAddam trilogy, \u201cHeart\u201d is closer in sensibility, plausibility and grit to this year\u2019s artificial intelligence thriller film \u201d Ex Machina.\u201d One source in the book cites an unemployment rate around 40 or 50 percent, hitting young men the hardest. In other words: a powderkeg. And it\u2019s not clear if it\u2019s already gone off, or if it\u2019s fixing to get worse.\n\nThere are market solutions to such chaos, of course, and we know one well already: Prison for profit. But with an ingenious innovation: it\u2019s a prison designed to appeal to, serve and make use of non-criminals. They\u2019re more plentiful than criminals and easier to control, to boot. This sort of plain, unsavory, darkly funny reasoning is plentiful in the novel, making it a more palatable kind of dystopian satire than the obsessively dark stuff that has been on trend.\n\nIn the twin cities of Positron and Consilience \u2014 a closed system, open only to approved applicants, how flattering \u2014 residents alternate months as prisoners and as guards or citizens supporting the prison in their warped good-old-days, Doris Day town.\n\nIt\u2019s also a life-long contract.\n\nZero percent homelessness, 100 percent employment, better profits than even the most Orwellian present-day systems.\n\nWeighed against the open hellscape Stan and Charmaine inhabit, shelter and a bit of routine sound great, even if it means being a slave worker half the time (and really, that\u2019s not all bad). So in they go to the twin cities, against the counsel of Stan\u2019s brother, something of a crimelord who has heard ugly things about the prison known as \u201cThe Positron Project,\u201d including that there\u2019s really no exit, except \u201cin a box, feet first.\u201d\n\nCharmaine and Stan spend their Consilience months together and their Positron months separated, and at first life is objectively better inside, if a bit dulled, all the better for Atwood to deliver sharply contrasting reality checks. The music is censored, no communication goes in or out, and they order all of their belongings, from clothing to dinnerware, via the official catalog. And of course there are gradual realizations of other tradeoffs, some predictably morbid \u2014 this is a dystopia, after all.\n\nIn the past decade, Atwood has been laugh-out-loud hilarious and occasionally too giddily over-the-top, as in some moments of \u201cThe Year of the Flood.\u201d Happily, even at its cutest, the jokes in \u201cHeart\u201d land.\n\nDeployed in \u201cHeart,\u201d the combination of levity and gravity produce a fine, quick entry point to Atwood\u2019s work and a welcome return for those fans who didn\u2019t keep up with the full MaddAddam trilogy.\n\nThere\u2019s more sex than you\u2019d expect, and it\u2019s not particularly sexy. There\u2019s a villain who once did a thesis project on \u201cParadise Lost.\u201d There are quick, dark turns, often rationalized as being necessitated by the greater good.\n\nAt its darkest, you almost have to put the book down for a break. It\u2019s not gore. There\u2019s nothing especially graphic. It\u2019s skin-crawling satire and doublespeak mastery. It\u2019s too close to some version of our shared truth for comfort.\n\nDave Burdick: 303-954-1957, dburdick@denverpost.com\n\nFICTION DYSTOPIAN SATIRE\n\nThe Heart Goes Last\n\nby Margaret Atwood (Nan A.
