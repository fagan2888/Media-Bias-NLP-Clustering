Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer said Tuesday on “Special Report with Bret Baier” that while the administration is celebrating hitting 7.1 million enrollees in the Affordable Care Act, that figure just isn’t accurate.

“This is a phony number, and it’s wonderfully precise. These guys go six months without any idea what the numbers are, and all of a sudden, it’s to a decimal point,” Krauthammer said. “But of course it’s meaningless because…we don’t know how many of them have paid…and how many were previously uninsured.”

He said if it turns out the overwhelming majority of those who signed up for the Affordable Care Act had been previously insured, and only signed up for the ACA because they couldn’t keep their plans, the administration may have fallen short of its intended goal of insuring those without health insurance.

Krauthammer went on to press the media to continue pursuing the real numbers, asking, “Are they going to say seven [million] is done and not revisit how many have actually paid, how many were previously uninsured, and of course how many are young and healthy?”
