Here, The Post's Ed O'Keefe points out a few of the most notable components of the legislation. (Davin Coburn/The Washington Post)\n\nThis item has been updated and revised.\n\n\n\nThe $1.01 trillion spending bill unveiled late Tuesday will keep most of the federal government funded through next September -- and it's packed with hundreds of policy instructions, known on Capitol Hill as \"riders,\" that will upset or excite Democrats, Republicans and various special interest groups.\n\nSo, what's in the bill? We've sifted through the legislation, consulted supporting documents from Democratic and Republican aides, and called out some of the more notable and controversial elements below. (If you want to review detailed reports on all 12 parts of the spending bill, click here.)\n\nPlease note: This is a fluid report that will be updated to add more detail or correct errors. What notable changes did we miss? What notable changes did you spot? Contact us or share details in the comments section below:\n\nABORTION:\n\nThe bill once again bans using federal funding to perform most abortions; blocks the use of local and federal funding for abortions in the District of Columbia; and blocks the use of federal dollars for abortions for federal prisoners. Republicans say that there's also new language directing the secretary of health and human services to ensure that consumers shopping for health-care coverage on the federal exchange can tell whether a plan covers abortion services.\n\nAFFORDABLE CARE ACT:\n\nThe law is still funded, but there's no new money for it. There's also no new ACA-related funding for the Internal Revenue Service and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the two agencies most responsible for implementing the law. The bill also would cut the budget of the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- what Republicans have called \"the death panel\" -- by $10 million.\n\nAFGHANISTAN:\n\nCongress withholds funding for the Afghan government \"until certain conditions are met,\" including implementing the bilateral security agreement reached with the United States.\n\nAMTRAK:\n\nThe nation's rail passenger service earns $1.39 billion, the same amount it currently receives. The rail service carries passengers through 46 states and hit an all-time high of 31.6 million passengers during the last fiscal year, according to Democratic aides.\n\nCAMPAIGN FINANCE:\n\nThe bill would dramatically expand the amount of money that wealthy political donors could inject into the national parties, drastically undercutting the 2002 landmark McCain-Feingold campaign finance overhaul. Bottom line: A donor who gave the maximum $32,400 this year to the Democratic National Committee or Republican National Committee would be able to donate another $291,600 on top of that to the party\u2019s additional arms -- a total of $324,000, ten times the current limit. Read more on this here.\n\nCENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL:\n\nThe agency would get more than $6.9 billion, an increase of about $42.7 million. The nation's leading disease-fighters also get $30 million to help fight Ebola (see below).\n\nCLEAN WATER ACT:\n\nIn a win for Republicans, the spending bill blocks the Environmental Protection Agency from applying the law to certain farm ponds and irrigation ditches -- a move that GOP aides said would benefit farmers.\n\nDODD-FRANK:\n\nDemocrats agreed to make some of the biggest changes yet to the 2010 financial regulatory reforms. In a deal sought by Republicans, the bill would reverse Dodd-Frank requirements that banks \"push out\" some of derivatives trading into separate entities not backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporations. Ever since being enacted, banks have been pushing to reverse the change. Now, the rules would go back to the way they used to be. But in exchange, Democrats say they secured more money for the enforcement budgets at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nEBOLA:\n\nRoughly $5.4 billion is provided across several agencies to combat the spread of the disease in the United States and around the world. The amount is less than the $6 billion Obama requested.\n\nEGYPT:\n\nThe beleaguered country gets $1.3 billion in military aid and $150 million in economic aid -- but the money is subject to \"democracy and human rights conditions,\" while the secretary of state can make exceptions for counterterrorism and border security operations.\n\nEMBASSIES:\n\nThere's $5.4 billion for security at U.S. embassies worldwide, $46 million more than Obama requested. The total includes new money to implement recommendations from the Benghazi Accountability Review Board. The bill also once again bans any embassy construction money to be spent on the lavish new U.S. embassy in London.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY:\n\nThe agency gets $8.1 billion, down $60 million from the last fiscal year. The agency's budget has been slashed by $2.2 billion, or 21 percent, since fiscal 2010, according to GOP aides. The cuts mean that EPA will have to reduce its staffing to the lowest levels since 1989.\n\nERIC CANTOR:\n\nWell, kind of. The former House majority leader stunned the political world by losing in a GOP primary last summer. But Congress agreed to provide $12.6 million for his signature legislative achievement -- the Gabriella Miller Kids First Act, which authorizes new federally-funded pediatric research. The bill was paid for by slashing federal funding for political conventions.\n\nFEDERAL WORKER PAY (AND CONFERENCES):\n\nThe bill allows a 1 percent pay raise ordered by Obama to take effect in January. And the legacy of embarrassing spending scandals at federal agencies persist as Congress once again banned or put limits on certain conferences, official travel and some employee awards.\n\nFOOD SAFETY (AND THE FDA)\n\nThere's $2.589 billion for the Food and Drug Administration, a $37 million increase from last year. There's $27 million in new funding for the Food Safety Modernization Act. The Food Safety and Inspection Service would receive $1.016 billion, a $5 million increase.\n\nGUANTANAMO BAY:\n\nOnce again the Obama administration is banned from transferring terrorism detainees to the United States from the U.S. military facility in Cuba. There's also a ban on building or buying any facility in the U.S. to house detainees. But the bill allows for the ongoing transfer of detainees to other countries.\n\nHEROIN:\n\nIn a modest attempt to address a growing crisis with the illicit drug, lawmakers are adding $7 million for a new anti-heroin task force run out of the Justice Department's COPS Office. The money will be used as part of a competitive grant program for drug enforcement, including investigations and operations to stop the distribution or sale of the drug, according to Democrats.\n\nIMMIGRATION:\n\nThe bill only funds the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees most immigration policy, until February. But negotiators gave new money for immigration programs at other federal agencies. There's $948 million for the Department of Health and Human Service's unaccompanied children program -- an $80 million increase. The program provides health and education services to the young migrants. The department also gets $14 million to help school districts absorbing new immigrant students. And the State Department would get $260 million to assist Central American countries from where of the immigrant children are coming.\n\nINTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE:\n\nOne of the GOP's favorite targets will see its budget slashed by $345.6 million. The nation\u2019s tax agency also would be banned from targeting organizations seeking tax-exempt status based on their ideological beliefs.\n\nISRAEL:\n\nThere's $3.1 billion in total aid for the country plus $619.8 million in defense aid.\n\nJOE BIDEN:\n\nThe legislation once again enacts a pay freeze for the vice president \"and senior political appointees.\"\n\nLIBYA:\n\nThe troubled country cannot receive any U.S. aid until the secretary of state confirms the country is cooperating with ongoing investigations into the September 2012 attack at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nJORDAN:\n\nThe Arab kingdom would receive $1 billion in economic and military aid, in addition to U.S. humanitarian aid for millions of Syrian refugees.\n\nLIGHT BULBS:\n\nThe bill once again prohibits new standards that would ban the use of cheaper, less energy efficient incandescent bulbs. The proposal was first introduced and set in motion by the Bush administration, but the Obama White House allowed the change to continue, despite sustained consumer demand for older bulbs.\n\nMARIJUANA:\n\nThe District of Columbia will be prohibited from legalizing marijuana for the much of the coming year. The development -- upending a voter-approved initiative -- shocked elected D.C. leaders, advocates for marijuana legalization and civil liberties groups. The bill also would block the Justice Department from interfering with state-level medical marijuana measures and prohibits the Drug Enforcement Agency from interfering with industrial hemp production.\n\nMETRORAIL:\n\nThe D.C. region's subway and bus system would earn $150 million in federal dollars for continued improvements. That's part of $10.9 billion set to be doled out for transit programs nationwide, including the construction of new rail and rapid bus projects in California, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, North Carolina and Texas. But Republicans stress that the bill has no new federal funding for high-speed rail projects, especially the ambitious Los Angeles-to-San Francisco routes envisioned by California Democrats.\n\nMILITARY PAY AND PERKS:\n\nMilitary service members will receive a 1 percent pay increase next year. But there's a pay freeze for generals and flag officers. The bill also ends a five percent discount on tobacco and tobacco-related products sold at military exchanges.\n\nNATIONAL MUSEUM OF AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY:\n\nThe agreement includes $24 million to complete the federal government's contribution to the new museum being built on the Mall. The rest of the money will be raised through private donations.\n\nNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH:\n\nThe nation's premier medical research agency would receive $30.3 billion, a $150 million overall increase. Democrats noted that the new funding helps especially for ongoing Alzheimer's and brain research programs.\n\nOFFICIAL PORTRAITS:\n\nYou're a government official and want an official portrait? You'll have to pay for it (or raise the funds). The bill bans taxpayer funding for official portraits of any Executive Branch employees, lawmakers and heads of legislative agencies.\n\nOVERSEAS MILITARY OPERATIONS:\n\nThere's $1.3 billion for a new Counterterrorism Partnership Fund; $5 billion for military operations to combat the Islamic State, including $1.6 billion to train Iraqi and Kurdish forces; $500 million for a Pentagon-led program to train and equip vetted Syrian opposition fighters; $810 million for ongoing military operations in Europe, including requirements that at least $175 million is spent in support of Ukraine and Baltic nations.\n\nPALESTINIAN AUTHORITY:\n\nThe bill stops assistance to the Palestinian Authority if it becomes a member of the United Nations or UN agencies without an agreement with Israel. It also prohibits funds for Hamas.\n\nPENSIONS:\n\nFor the first time, the benefits of current retirees could be severely cut, part of an effort to save some of the nation\u2019s most distressed pension plans. The change would alter 40 years of federal law and could affect millions of workers, many of them part of a shrinking corps of middle-income employees in businesses such as trucking, construction and supermarkets. Read more on this here.\n\nU.S. POSTAL SERVICE:\n\nYou like your mail on Saturdays? You'll keep your mail on Saturdays. The bill requires the mail service to continue six-day deliveries, despite a years-long attempt to cut back on service to save money.\n\nPOTATOES:\n\nWhite potatoes, to be exact. The Women, Infants and Children program that provides food aid to low-income families would receive $6.6 billion, a $93 million cut from the last fiscal year. But the program will be required to ensure that \"all varieties of fresh vegetables, including white potatoes, are eligible for purchase\" through the program, said Republicans. The change is a big victory for the potato lobby, which has long fought to be part of the food assistance program.\n\nRACE TO THE TOP:\n\nThe bill cuts funding for Obama's signature education initiative -- a big blow to his education legacy, according to The Post's Valerie Strauss. Overall, the Education Department would take a slight hit in funding; at $70.5 billion, down $133 million below the fiscal year 2014, but special education grants to states would get $25 million more than last year, up to $11.5 billion. There is also no funding for the controversial Common Core State Standards in this legislation.\n\nRAILROADS:\n\nAmong other things, there's $3 million to expand inspections along the roughly 14,000 miles of track used by trains hauling oil tankers.\n\nSAGE-GROUSE:\n\nIn a victory for the GOP, the bill would ban the Fish and Wildlife Service from adding the rare bird found in several Western states to the Endangered Species List. Republicans argue that adding the bird to the list \"would have severe economic consequences on Western states and the nation\u2019s efforts to become energy independent.\" But there's also $15 million for the Bureau of Land Management to conserve sage-grouse habitats.\n\nSCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM:\n\nThe school lunch nutritional changes sought by First Lady Michelle Obama take a hit. The bill allows more flexibility to school districts to implement new whole grain nutrition standards \"if the school can demonstrate a hardship\" when buying whole grain products, according to Republicans. The bill also relaxes new sodium standards until they are \"supported by additional scientific studies.\"\n\nSEXUAL ASSAULT IN THE MILITARY:\n\nThere's $257 million for the Pentagon's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response programs, including $25 million more to expand the Sexual Assault Victims\u2019 Counsel program. But Democrats, led by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), are expected to make a final push to expand the program this week.\n\nTRUCKING:\n\nIn a victory for the trucking industry, the bill blocks new Transportation Department regulations requiring truckers to get two nights of sleep before starting a new work week. The regulation slashed a typical trucker's work week to 70 hours, down from 82 hours.\n\nUNITED NATIONS:\n\nThe perennial ban on providing money for the ongoing renovation of U.N. Headquarters in New York remains intact.\n\nU.S. CAPITOL (AND RELATED AGENCIES):\n\nThere's $21 million to continue restoring the cast-iron Capitol Dome. And $348 million for the U.S. Capitol Police (a force with 1,775 officers). Lawmakers also plan to save $10,000 by allowing the congressional Office of Compliance to email congressional staffers about their employment rights. Old rules required the office to send such notices by snail mail. Finally, for the first time the agency formerly known as the Government Printing Office is now officially known as the Government Publishing Office.\n\nVETERANS:\n\nAfter a year of embarrassing scandals at the sprawling Department of Veterans Affairs, lawmakers are making good on promises to provide more money and oversight. There's a total of $159.1 billion in discretionary and mandatory spending. Of that, $209 million was added to address new costs related to the bipartisan veterans' reform bill passed last summer. The legislation calls for adding medical staff and expanding dozens of facilities. In order to specifically addressing the \"wait list\" scandal, the VA's inspector general is getting a $5 million budget increase to continue investigating lapses in patient care.\n\nWHISTLEBLOWERS:\n\nThe bill includes language ensuring that government contractors are not barred from reporting allegations of waste, fraud or abuse if they sign a confidentiality agreement. And the Occupational Safety and Health Administration would receive a $500,000 increase for its enforcement of existing whistleblower laws.\n\nWHITE HOUSE BUDGET:\n\nThere's $222 million for executive mansion operations, a $10 million increase. The money pays for the National Security and Homeland Security councils, the Council of Economic Advisers, the vice president's office and the executive residence. The bill doesn't provide any new funding \"to address security weaknesses at the White House complex,\" according to Democrats. But the U.S. Secret Service would be allowed to use some of its funding \"to prepare and train for the next presidential election campaign,\" Democrats said.\n\nWOLVES:\n\nWell, only if you're attacked. There's $1 million in the bill \"to compensate ranchers for livestock killed by wolves.\"\n\nYUCCA MOUNTAIN:\n\nThere's no new money for the site, but current money for it must be spent pursuant to a recent court decision. Republicans say that the bill continues to leave open the possibility that the site could be used someday to store nuclear waste -- but that won't happen as long as Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) is around.\n\nMichael Fletcher, Matea Gold, Christopher Ingraham, Valerie Strauss and Eric Yoder contributed to this report.\n\nWhat notable changes did we miss?
