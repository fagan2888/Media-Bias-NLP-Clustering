The House GOP\u2019s latest budget is yet another example.\n\nRepublican opposition to Obamacare, at its core a centrist health-care reform, stepped out of the realm of the rational and into the realm of the theological long ago. One indication has been the hysteria over the law\u2019s \u201cdeath panels.\u201d Experts and professional fact-checkers have debunked the notion that the Affordable Care Act would empower a faceless government board to deny critical health-care procedures, the Obama-era equivalent of pushing inconvenient seniors onto ice floes. But the GOP\u2019s death-panel nonsense still has a hold on the party, its illogic written explicitly into the House\u2019s budget.\n\n\u201cThis budget repeals the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), an unelected, unaccountable board of 15 bureaucrats charged with making coverage decisions on Medicare,\u201d the document reads.\n\nLet\u2019s translate that. If Medicare spending gets out of control, rapidly claiming more and more national wealth and robbing funding from other important priorities, Obamacare has charged a panel of experts, the IPAB, to step in and make recommendations about how to keep costs under control without affecting coverage or the quality of care. The point is to wring needless costs out of the program, not to deny important treatments. The board is hardly unaccountable: A supermajority in Congress can vote down IPAB recommendations. Lawmakers just can\u2019t ignore them, which was the problem with IPAB\u2019s utterly toothless predecessor, MedPAC. The IPAB arrangement is a modest cost-control measure that Republicans misconstrued into a dangerous health-care rationing regime years ago and continue to slander now.\n\nRepublicans should recognize how bad their repeal idea is. They claimed the mantle of fiscal responsibility during the Obama years, insisting that big entitlement programs such as Medicare need reform to forestall a painful fiscal reckoning. Their preferred reform is voucherizing Medicare, which is worth considering. But even in the system Republicans favor, one would still expect a debt-conscious Congress to demand oversight assuring that the massive amount of taxpayer money going to seniors\u2019 health care isn\u2019t squandered. Yet Republicans take pride in their proposal to destroy a board designed to do exactly that. At the least, one would expect a debt-conscious Congress to maintain the cost-control mechanisms already in place. But making IPAB a point of demagoguery instead is an easy way to make Obamacare seem to be the monstrous disaster it\u2019s not.\n\nIf anything, IPAB should be given more power to assess the comparative effectiveness of various treatments \u2014 based on real data, not the political preferences of Congress \u2014 and to recommend Medicare payment standards that would make health care better, or that at least would achieve similar outcomes with less money. Instead, the board is limited to recommending broad payment and innovation policies\n\nRepublicans are right that Congress can\u2019t sit back and assume that all the money the nation devotes to health care is spent wisely.
