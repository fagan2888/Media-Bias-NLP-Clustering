He\u2019s actually right that a government shutdown or a debt-ceiling showdown, one way to fight Obamacare, won\u2019t be good for the economy per se, but he\u2019s absolutely wrong to suggest that the Republican House\u2019s opposition to Obamacare doesn\u2019t have sound economic justifications.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no serious evidence that the [Affordable Care Act], which has kept the rise of health-care costs to their lowest level in 50 years, is harming economic growth,\u201d the president said. This is not a serious statement.\n\nObamacare might be a great law, but it imposes serious costs to the U.S. economy: The law will levy $1 trillion in taxes over the next ten years \u2014 which, regardless of whether the transfers it funds are socially desirable, is undeniably a large drag on the economy; taxes are inherently inefficient. And the ACA\u2019s taxes, which will increase double taxation of capital, impose excise taxes on an important industry (medical devices), and raise the costs of employment, are especially damaging. The law\u2019s provisions will increase the implicit, marginal income tax on labor by about 5 percentage points, according to the University of Chicago\u2019s Casey Mulligan. An NBER study found that the large expansion in means-tested free insurance the ACA will provide could cause almost a million Americans to drop out of the labor force \u2014 which makes the unemployment rate look better, but is undoubtedly a bad development for the economy overall. While we don\u2019t know the full effects of Obamacare on working hours and full-time employment yet, it is an unequivocally bad thing for the efficiency of the labor market to force employers to provide health insurance once employees average 30 or more hours a week, and once a business hires its 51st employee. One could go on.\n\nThere are economic benefits to broader health-care coverage \u2014 to the extent that it improves health outcomes (Medicaid probably doesn\u2019t, but private insurance should), we\u2019ll have a healthier work force; there are upsides to ensuring people can leave their jobs without losing access to insurance, etc. \u2014 but Obamacare is going to present massive fiscal and regulatory costs (and already has) without getting that many more people covered (which it hasn\u2019t yet). It would probably be fair to say that the economic effects of the law so far have been negative overall, and the jury is still out on the long-term balance \u2014 but many well-respected, mainstream economists predict it\u2019ll be a net negative for the economy.\n\nThe president went on to contend that no independent (or serious, or whatever) economist would argue that getting rid of Obamacare should be the U.S.\u2019s top economic priority \u2014 that is indeed a less well-supported contention than believing it will merely be a net economic negative. Even less mainstream a view is held by those who consider Obamacare so harmful it would be (as a question of economic growth alone) worth incurring the economic costs of a government shutdown or a debt-ceiling debate to have a slim chance at defunding it for a few months \u2013 that would indeed not be a view held by many economists. But denying that there\u2019s any evidence at all the ACA is a bad economic policy is silly, and downright offensive to the president\u2019s audience.\n\nThe president\u2019s other citation of the consensus of \u201cindependent economists\u201d in today\u2019s address came when he criticized Republicans for supporting spending cuts, especially those that came in the sequester, with the president contending they had slowed economic growth. He\u2019s right that the consensus of academic economists, generally relying on a Keynesian model, would probably agree with this assessment (it\u2019s also sort of a truism in the short term, unless you hold a truly radical understanding of government spending and its effect on economic growth, since government spending is part of GDP). What he doesn\u2019t mention is that the same \u201cindependent economists,\u201d using the same models, would agree that the fiscal-cliff deal he insisted on (which increases taxes by tens of billions of dollars this year), the payroll-tax hike he allowed to happen, and the tax increases imposed by his health-care law are also all government policies that are dragging down economic growth. Lastly, I\u2019d actually note that both sides of the fiscal drags this year \u2014 spending cuts and tax increases \u2014 have actually not been quite as bad as many of those experts predicted, though they\u2019ve definitely shown up.
