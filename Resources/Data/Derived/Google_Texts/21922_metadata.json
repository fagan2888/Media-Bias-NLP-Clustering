(Photo: File ) Story Highlights I am extremely disappointed in your failure to cover a huge event that occurs every year in our city. The Otter Street Fishing Club's annual Walleye Fishing Tournament.\n\nFirst off-Congratulations for the Northwestern's No. 1 rank, in the entire United States, in the category of \"adult contact every week.\" (June 15). However in light of this accomplishment and the commendable job you do in promoting Oshkosh - The Event City. I am extremely disappointed in your failure to cover a huge event that occurs every year in our city. The Otter Street Fishing Club's annual Walleye Fishing Tournament.\n\nThis year's event on, June 14 and 15, was not mentioned or covered by the Northwestern on Friday, Saturday, Sunday or Monday, not even in the little \"Daily Events\" column. Who won? Who knows!\n\nYou folks should have ambled down to Menominee Park Sunday afternoon during the weigh-in of the fisherperson's catch and see who won?\n\nThen amble over a taken a look at all the fancy 30+ thousand dollar boats, (5) thousand dollar trailers, 40+ thousand dollar trucks and the additional thousands of dollars of equipment in the boats, as to have an appreciation for the financial aspect of these people who have come to town to fish in our Oshkosh town on our great Lake Winnebago.\n\nKeep in mind there were nearly 300 hundred 2 person teams entered in the tournament. Probably, at least, two-thirds were from out of town.\n\nThese folks are here on Thursday and Friday for pre-fishing practice and of course, Saturday and Sunday. This is a lot of motel money, food money and more that our local establishments profit form significantly!\n\nThen amble over to where the weigh in is taking place and observe the camaraderie of the folks. The wives, their children, girlfriends, boyfriends and other friends.\n\nCheck out the \"catch board\" to see who caught what. Have a beer, a pop, a brat, or burger and say \"hi\" to friends and neighbors.\n\nThis Otter Street Fishing Club event should be included in the Oshkosh-The Event City's line up. It deserves the recognition and appreciation of the city and in particular the Oshkosh Northwestern.\n\nJim Patterson\n\nOshkosh\n\nWisconsinoutdoorfun.com: More fishing news from around the state\n\nRead or Share this story: http://oshko.sh/1s0d899", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "I am extremely disappointed in your failure to cover a huge event that occurs every year in our city.
