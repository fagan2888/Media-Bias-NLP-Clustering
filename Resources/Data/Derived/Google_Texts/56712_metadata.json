We\u2019re at Day 37. \u2026 If (a beacon) is still going it is very, very quiet at this point,\u201d Jeff Densmore told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union with Candy Crowley.\u201d\n\nDensmore, director of engineering for Dukane Seacom, said his company has been helping search officials interpret the data from recent audio signals in the southern Indian Ocean, where the plane is thought to have been when it reached the end of its fuel supply.\n\nThe signals were definitely man-made, he said, but there is no way to be 100% sure they came from the flight data recorder in the tail of the plane or the cockpit voice recorder until wreckage or the so-called black boxes are found on the ocean floor.\n\nThe batteries that send out the signals were certified to last 30 days, a deadline that\u2019s already passed.\n\n\u201cWe are in a transition period at the moment,\u201d retired Lt. Col. Michael Kay of the Royal Air Force told CNN, referring to the fact that searchers will soon have to give up hunting with pinger locators and switch to sonar. \u201cWe know that the (data recorder) batteries last between 30 and 40 days.\u201d\n\nBlack boxes are vital to determine cause\n\nA top Malaysian official on Sunday reaffirmed the importance of finding the black boxes from the Boeing 777 if the mystery of the missing airliner is ultimately to be solved.\n\nFor instance, it would be difficult for investigators to clear crew or passengers until the two recorders are located, Malaysia\u2019s acting transport minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, said at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nThe inspector general of police has found nothing suspicious about the passenger manifest, Hishammuddin said, but \u201che did not say that they all had been cleared on the four issues that the police are still investigating, which is the possible hijacking, issues of terrorism, psychological and personal problems.\n\n\u201cThat is an ongoing thing, and I don\u2019t think the IGP would have meant that they have all been cleared, because unless we find more information, specifically on data in the black box, I don\u2019t think any chief of police would be in the position\u201d to declare the cases cleared, he said.\n\nThe plane\u2019s senior pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, 53, has received a lot of attention in the media in the wake of the disaster. Investigators believe it was his voice speaking the last words heard from Flight 370, \u201cGood night, Malaysian 370.\u201d\n\nIn recent years Zaharie was active on social media, posting videos in which he explained how to optimize an air conditioning system to reduce electricity bills and showing photos of his many gadgets. He loved food and cooking.\n\nHe was also passionate about politics, urging people to vote out the current Malaysian government. But nothing in his social media posts would seem to suggest foul play in MH370\u2019s disappearance.\n\nStill seeking pings\n\nThe search continued Sunday, 36 days after the plane carrying 239 people vanished from radar screens early March 8 during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.\n\nAfter a week during which the search area in the southern Indian Ocean shrank each day, it grew significantly on Sunday \u2014 by almost 40%.\n\nThe Australian Maritime Safety Authority said teams would conduct a visual search of approximately 22,200 square miles (57,500 square kilometers). The center of the search area lies about 1,370 miles (2,200 kilometers) northwest of Perth, Australia.\n\nUp to 11 military aircraft, one civil aircraft and 14 ships assisted in Sunday\u2019s search for the missing airliner, the Australia\u2019s Joint Agency Coordination Centre said.\n\nThe search area has shifted each day as officials look at new data and study the ocean currents. Still, no debris has been found and promising audio signals heard days ago were far apart.\n\nJeff Wise, an aviation analyst, said Sunday\u2019s enlarging search area makes observers wonder.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really inspire confidence (in the people running the search),\u201d he told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d\n\nHe said the fact that searchers haven\u2019t heard pings in five days makes him wonder whether it\u2019s time to send down underwater vehicles with sidescan sonar.\n\n\u201cUnless they have some other information that we are not aware of, it seems like if they really did think this was the plane that they would go down and really try to locate it,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Saturday, searchers aboard the Australian vessel Ocean Shield continued towing the ping locator \u2014 referred to as a TPL \u2014 at a walking pace through the water in hopes of picking up new signals from either or both of the locator beacons that were attached to the plane\u2019s cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder, said Cmdr. William Marks, the U.S. Navy commander in charge of the American presence involved in the search effort.\n\nOnce the searchers conclude there is no hope that the batteries could still power the beacons, searchers will lower into the water a sonar device called the Bluefin-21 to scour the ocean floor. The Bluefin\u2019s pace is slower than that of a TPL, Marks said.\n\nFour pings, one dud\n\nOn April 5, the towed pinger locator detected two sets of underwater pulses of a frequency close to that used by the locator beacons. Three days later, last Tuesday, it reacquired the signals twice.\n\nAll four signals were within 17 miles of one another.\n\nA fifth ping, detected Thursday by a sonobuoy dropped from an airplane, is \u201cunlikely to be related to the aircraft black boxes,\u201d Australian chief search coordinator Angus Houston said a day later.", "article_metadata": {"description": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (CNN) -- The batteries that power the beacons attached to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370's black boxes are \"most likely\" dead or almost depleted, an official with the company that designs and builds the pingers told CNN on Sunday.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "FOX2now.com", "description": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (CNN) \u2014 The batteries that power the beacons attached to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370\u2019s black boxes are \u201cmost likely\u201d dead or almost depleted, an offi\u2026", "title": "MH370: Black box pingers are \u2018most likely\u2019 dead, official says", "url": "http://fox2now.com/2014/04/13/mh370-black-box-pingers-are-most-likely-dead-official-says/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvktvi.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/mh370-pinger1.jpg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvktvi.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/mh370-pinger1.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@fox2now", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fox2now"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "St. Louis News, Weather & Sports From FOX 2", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=339559940", "fb": {"pages": 48244074227}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://fox2now.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/755e6b237618f1b2fe250cb518a56c05?s=16", "application-name": "FOX2now.com", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox2now", "published_time": "2014-04-14T00:00:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-13T23:19:52+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox2now"}, "keywords": "news,", "google-site-verification": "v2FI_hS3rbbnwol7DXZ8ZI4CeJjQgWkN7jruGb7UZfc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd093d\"", "article_summary": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (CNN) \u2014 The batteries that power the beacons attached to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370\u2019s black boxes are \u201cmost likely\u201d dead or almost depleted, an official with the company that designs and builds the pingers told CNN on Sunday.\nA fifth ping, detected Thursday by a sonobuoy dropped from an airplane, is \u201cunlikely to be related to the aircraft black boxes,\u201d Australian chief search coordinator Angus Houston said a day later.\nThe batteries that send out the signals were certified to last 30 days, a deadline that\u2019s already passed.\nStill, no debris has been found and promising audio signals heard days ago were far apart.\nThe search area has shifted each day as officials look at new data and study the ocean currents."}
