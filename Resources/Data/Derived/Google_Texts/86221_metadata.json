The Texas senator was the first presidential candidate to go on television, releasing a commercial in Iowa about \u201cthe transformative love of Jesus Christ\u201d over Easter weekend last year, weeks before the other Republican candidates even entered the race. Cruz had wisely hired two separate firms to coordinate media: a hip, young Hollywood operation to design viral content, and a more staid firm in Washington that would craft more traditional issue and biographical spots like the Easter ad.\n\nA couple of the viral ads have proven memorable because of their humor. In one, Cruz reads Christmas stories like \u201cHow Obamacare Stole Christmas\u201d and \u201cRudolf the Underemployed Reindeer\u201d aloud to his family. In another, bankers and journalists clutching legal pads and laptops scurry across the border while a Mission Impossible-like soundtrack thuds in the background.\n\nBut the Cruz ads that matter most are the ones where he talks straight into the camera. In January, the television analytics firm Ace Metrix assembled a panel to assess which campaign ads from the Republican race had been most effective. They singled out the 11 best, and five had been produced for Cruz. The single highest-scoring ad showed the Texas senator earnestly holding forth for 30 seconds, saying: \u201cEvery Islamic militant will know if you wage jihad against us, you\u2019re signing your death warrant. And under no circumstances will I ever apologize for America.\u201d\n\nWhen Marco Rubio tried this format, he struggled to summon emotion for the cameras and ended up looking like he had food poisoning. Cruz, however, an actor in high school (he played Rolf, the delivery boy-turned-Nazi, in The Sound of Music) and law school, knows how to convey sentiment on the small screen. You almost empathize with him, no matter what you think about that other Ted Cruz, because he cares so much about America, looks so earnest, and is so troubled about the direction we\u2019re heading in.\n\nThese ads haven\u2019t always paid off\u2014heavy rotations in South Carolina yielded Cruz nothing in that primary\u2014but it appears they\u2019re working in Wisconsin, where the Texas senator is locked (alongside Republican establishment groups) in a battle to derail Trump. Two of Cruz\u2019s five new ads in the Badger State are set around the same kitchen table. Another looks like it was filmed in his living room. \u201cAs American families sit around their kitchen tables, they\u2019re worried,\u201d Cruz says in one. \u201cWorried they\u2019re falling behind, worried about their jobs, their freedom, their security.\u201d Soft lighting and soaring music add the uplifting ethos. With the camera focused on him for a full 30 seconds, Cruz looks like a plainspoken guy who\u2019s eschewing all the campaign chicanery to tell voters what he really thinks.\n\nOne secret to these ads\u2019 success in Wisconsin might be familiarity: They strongly resemble the commercials that have helped Governor Scott Walker win two elections (and one recount) in Wisconsin\u2014ads in which Walker talked directly to viewers about job creation or abortion from what looked like his living room.\n\nMore important, many Wisconsin Republicans are clearly looking for an antidote to Trumpism. The state\u2019s unusually influential conservative radio hosts are bemoaning Trump on the airwaves. Charlie Sykes, for example, says Wisconsinites are \u201cnot buying the vulgar buffoonery that Trump is selling\u201d\u2014and the polls, including a recent one showing Cruz with a ten-point edge in the state, indicate that he\u2019s on to something. Meanwhile, the Ted Cruz that Wisconsin TV viewers are seeing looks like Trump\u2019s polar opposite\u2014no vulgarity, no buffoonery, no celebrity, no insult-shouting. Just Ted Cruz, vastly underrated actor, performing sincerity, and performing it very well.\n\nTHIS WEEK\u2019S ADS:\n\nWhile there were some commercials airing in New York this week, in the long build-up to its April 19 primary, Wisconsin\u2014which votes next Tuesday\u2014was the state most bombarded with new ads. We\u2019ve analyzed ten ads that debuted this week and listed the rest below. You can see every presidential campaign ad that\u2019s run during this cycle at the New Republic\u2019s 2016 Campaign Ad Archive.\n\nJohn Kasich: \u201cNose\u201d\n\nType: Attack ad\n\n\n\nWho Paid for It? New Day for America, the super PAC supporting John Kasich\n\nReach: Aired in Wisconsin as part of a $500,000 ad buy\n\nImpact: This ad includes what may be the single most disturbing image this presidential cycle: Cruz\u2019s nose growing so long and creeping around his neck that it eventually strangles him in a fleshy, nasal noose. It\u2019ll surely strike fear into the hearts of children everywhere\u2014not to mention ruin Pinocchio for good.\n\nThis week\u2019s other ad from New Day for America: \u201cAgain\u201d\n\nTed Cruz: \u201cOpportunity\u201d\n\nType: Issue ad\n\n\n\nWho Paid for It? The Cruz campaign\n\nReach: Aired in Wisconsin\n\nImpact: Ted Cruz sometimes seems like he\u2019s straining for rhetorical flourishes in his campaign ads\u2014to wit, from this one, \u201cmachinists with callouses on their hands,\u201d \u201cpeople place solutions over slogans,\u201d and \u201ccourageous conservatives reigniting the promise of America.\u201d Please lay off the alliteration, TrusTed.\n\n\n\nTed Cruz: \u201cWalker\u201d\n\nType: Endorsement ad\n\n\n\nWho Paid for It? The Cruz campaign\n\nReach: Aired in Wisconsin\n\nImpact: One awkward politician endorses another. Scott Walker and Ted Cruz are a match made in heaven. They both try to frame themselves as plainspoken, average Americans. They even look somewhat similar with their thinning, dark hair. Walker\u2019s endorsement should pack a sizable punch in the Badger State, where the Wisconsin governor is still popular among Republicans.\n\nTed Cruz: \u201cEvery Day Fighter\u201d\n\nType: Issue ad\n\n\n\nWho Paid for It? The Cruz campaign\n\nReach: Aired in Wisconsin as part of a $350,000 ad buy\n\nImpact: The car shop featured in this Cruz spot is a picturesque Republican idyll\u2014a small business decked out with American flags, old cars, and strapping white men. No wonder the campaign chose to film it here.\n\nTed Cruz: \u201cTax Plan\u201d\n\nType: Issue ad\n\n\n\nWho Paid for It? The Cruz campaign\n\nReach: Aired in Wisconsin as part of a $350,000 ad buy\n\n\n\nImpact: This is another earnest Ted Cruz ad set to music, notable mainly because the narrator says his tax plan would \u201cEND the IRS\u201d and insists on drawing a bold X over IRS in case we didn\u2019t already get the message.\n\nTed Cruz: \u201cWorried\u201d\n\nType: Issue ad\n\n\n\nWho Paid for It? The Cruz campaign\n\nReach: Aired in Wisconsin as part of a $350,000 ad buy\n\n\n\nImpact: Yet another earnest Ted Cruz ad set to music! While the message isn\u2019t particularly memorable, the impression of Cruz that it leaves with viewers\u2014that he\u2019s thoughtful, concerned, and relatively sympathetic\u2014is what might make the difference when the Texas senator goes head-to-head with Donald Trump in Wisconsin on Tuesday.\n\nClub for Growth: \u201cMath\u201d\n\nType: Attack ad\n\n\n\nWho Paid for It? Club for Growth, an anti-tax group that has endorsed Ted Cruz\n\nReach: Aired in Wisconsin as part of a $1 million ad buy\n\nImpact: This ad from the makes the same argument that conservatives have been trotting out whenever they want Kasich to leave the race: That he\u2019ll never come anywhere close to the 1,237 delegates he would need to win the nomination outright.\n\nIt\u2019s a valid point! But this ad frames the issue as \u201cmath,\u201d and then does no math whatsoever, apart from piling two little blocks on one another.\n\nTed Cruz: \u201cKasich Won\u2019t Play\u201d\n\nType: Attack ad\n\n\n\nWho Paid for It? Trusted Leadership PAC, an outside group supporting Ted Cruz\n\nReach: Aired in Wisconsin\n\nImpact: Tired sports cliches are a fixture in political campaigns, but this ad takes \u2018em to a new level. It photoshops the dweeby Ohio governor John Kasich into various athletic settings, including one animated image of Xs and Os moving around a basketball court drawn on a chalkboard.\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton: \u201cNew York\u201d\n\nType: Issue ad\n\n\n\nWho Paid for It? The Clinton campaign\n\nReach: Aired in New York\n\nImpact: This ad, which takes viewers around New York City from Ellis Island to a deli counter, is the first time Hillary Clinton has directly taken on Donald Trump in a campaign ad. Her message is simple: \u201cNew York values\u201d really mean inclusivity and multiculturalism, not bigotry and xenophobia.\n\nThis week\u2019s other ads from the Clinton campaign: \u201cEducation\u201d and \u201cWork Hard\u201d\n\nThis week\u2019s other ads from Our Principles PAC: \u201cKnow\u201d and \u201cTrust\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "As Wisconsin TV viewers are discovering this week, nobody\u2019s better at the \u201ctalking directly to you\u201d ad than the Texas senator and former thespian.", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "As Wisconsin TV viewers are discovering this week, nobody\u2019s better at the \u201ctalking directly to you\u201d ad than the Texas senator and former thespian.", "title": "Ted Cruz Is a Damn Good Actor", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/d6c653f29e33a0cc6cd9bfc48b8d4adaf3f6e0c6.png?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/132294/ted-cruz-damn-good-actor", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As Wisconsin TV viewers are discovering this week, nobody\u2019s better at the \u201ctalking directly to you\u201d ad than the Texas senator and former thespian.", "title": "Ted Cruz Is a Damn Good Actor", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/d6c653f29e33a0cc6cd9bfc48b8d4adaf3f6e0c6.png?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "creator": "@laurareston", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/d6c653f29e33a0cc6cd9bfc48b8d4adaf3f6e0c6.png\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Ted Cruz Is a Damn Good Actor \",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/132294/ted-cruz-damn-good-actor\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"pub_date\":\"2016-04-01T10:00:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":132294,\"author\":\"Laura Reston\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Politics\",\"Election 2016\",\"Wisconsin\",\"Advertising\",\"Ted Cruz\",\"Scott Walker\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Politics", "published_time": "2016-04-01"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "article_summary": "You can see every presidential campaign ad that\u2019s run during this cycle at the New Republic\u2019s 2016 Campaign Ad Archive.\nThe Cruz campaignReach: Aired in Wisconsin as part of a $350,000 ad buyImpact: Yet another earnest Ted Cruz ad set to music!\nJust Ted Cruz, vastly underrated actor, performing sincerity, and performing it very well.\nTed Cruz: \u201cWorried\u201dType: Issue adWho Paid for It?\nTed Cruz: \u201cEvery Day Fighter\u201dType: Issue adWho Paid for It?"}
