Five other people in several other vehicles suffered lesser injuries.\n\nIn the months before the shooting, Harris posted videos of himself fanning a big handful of $100 bills and boasting about luxury cars, prostitutes and living in a house full of women who paid him. Records showed he lived in Miami, Atlanta and Las Vegas.\n\nHe has never been convicted of pimping. But he was convicted in South Carolina in 2004 of felony possession with intent to sell a stolen pistol and in Atlanta of misdemeanor marijuana possession.\n\n_____\n\nFind Ken Ritter on Twitter: http://twitter.com/krttr", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Nevada judge agreed Wednesday to postpone sentencing until Feb. 26 for a self-described pimp who was convicted of sexual assault last September in one case and is due to stand trial later this year in a Las Vegas Strip shooting and fiery crash that left three people dead.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A Nevada judge agreed Wednesday to postpone sentencing until Feb. 26 for a self-described pimp who was convicted of sexual assault last September in one case and is due to stand trial later this year in a Las Vegas Strip shooting and fiery crash that left three people dead.", "title": "Sentencing reset for Las Vegas carnage defendant", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/15/date-may-be-reset-for-las-vegas-carnage-defendant/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/15/cc0b09f71d51f202480f6a70670098ed.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/15/cc0b09f71d51f202480f6a70670098ed.jpg", "description": "A Nevada judge agreed Wednesday to postpone sentencing until Feb. 26 for a self-described pimp who was convicted of sexual assault last September in one case and is due to stand trial later this year", "card": "summary", "title": "Sentencing reset for Las Vegas carnage defendant"}, "Author": "KEN RITTER", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Ammar Asim Faruq Harris, Robert Langford"}, "article_summary": "Records showed he lived in Miami, Atlanta and Las Vegas.\nHe remains jailed, facing a possible sentence of life in state prison after a jury found him guilty in the June 2010 sex attack on an 18-year-old woman at a Las Vegas condominium.\nLAS VEGAS (AP) - A Nevada judge agreed Wednesday to postpone sentencing until Feb. 26 for a self-described pimp who was convicted of sexual assault last September in one case and is due to stand trial later this year in a Las Vegas Strip shooting and fiery crash that left three people dead.\nIn the months before the shooting, Harris posted videos of himself fanning a big handful of $100 bills and boasting about luxury cars, prostitutes and living in a house full of women who paid him.\nLangford has said they may appeal on grounds that Harris didn\u2019t receive a fair trial."}
