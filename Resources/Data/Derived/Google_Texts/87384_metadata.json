Clinton: Vote for your dreams\n\nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. \u2014 Former President Bill Clinton on Tuesday made a tailored pitch to young voters, urging students to back Democrats on the 2014 ballot because they are \u201ctoo young\u201d to cast votes of \u201cresentment.\u201d\n\nThose comments came at the University of Arkansas\u2019 flagship campus on the third stop of Clinton\u2019s two-day, four-stop tour stumping for Arkansas Democrats.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWhy are all these people trying to get you to cast resentment votes?\u201d Clinton, the state\u2019s beloved former governor, said of national Republicans. \u201cYou\u2019re too young. You should be voting for what you\u2019re for. \u2026 You should be voting for your dreams.\u201d\n\nIt was an echo of remarks he made a day earlier, when Clinton argued that the GOP was trying to convince Arkansans to view the midterm elections as their last chance to vote against President Barack Obama, who is deeply unpopular here. Clinton has been making the case that Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mike Ross should be viewed on their own merits and that the national party is irrelevant in their races.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Why the Supreme Court punted on gay marriage)\n\nBut polls show that Ross is behind GOP candidate Asa Hutchinson and Pryor is in one of the closest races of the cycle, against Rep. Tom Cotton.\n\nClinton\u2019s emphasis here, speaking to a pavilion packed with cheering students, was more focused on the importance of the youth vote \u2014 a group that tends to back Democrats but also tends to stay home during midterms.\n\n\u201cThe reason this keeps happening is, you don\u2019t show up in midterms!\u201d he admonished as he lamented congressional gridlock.\n\nAs he did in earlier stops, Clinton noted that the polls show the Democrats either locked in close races or trailing \u2014 but he said that was based on the assumption that young people don\u2019t vote.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: CIA didn't know it had 'torture' report)\n\n\u201cThis is all about whether you show up,\u201d he said here, saying that midterms are \u201cevery bit as important to your future as elections when there is a presidential candidate on the ballot.\u201d\n\nClinton zeroed in on issues like student loans and equal pay for men and women, hot-button issues for the base. But he couldn\u2019t help waxing nostalgic about his past. He reminisced about the \u201cbroad-based prosperity\u201d enjoyed during his administration. And he described his time teaching law at this school as among the happiest times he and his wife \u2014 possible presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton \u2014 experienced.\n\n\u201cI got to live my dreams,\u201d he said, hitting the podium as he reflected on the \u201csix jobs\u201d he worked through law school, the gig he held down as an undergrad and his eventual ability to pay down his student debt. He argued that the Democrats on the ballot want to make that kind of future more accessible for everyone \u2014 and that students here should care about that, too.\n\nClinton, reminding the students to take the election personally, told the crowd: \u201cI\u2019ve got more yesterdays than tomorrows. You\u2019ve got more tomorrows than yesterdays.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "He tells Arkansas students to back Democrats and reject Republican attacks.", "title": "Clinton: Vote for your dreams", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/bill-clinton-arkansas-voters-111669.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/10/07/141007_bill_clinton_ap_605.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Elections,2016 Elections,Arkansas,Bill Clinton", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "He tells Arkansas students to back Democrats and reject Republican attacks.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd04f7\"", "article_summary": "Clinton: Vote for your dreamsFAYETTEVILLE, Ark.\n'You should be voting for your dreams,' Clinton tells students.\nClinton, reminding the students to take the election personally, told the crowd: \u201cI\u2019ve got more yesterdays than tomorrows.\nStory Continued Below\u201cWhy are all these people trying to get you to cast resentment votes?\u201d Clinton, the state\u2019s beloved former governor, said of national Republicans.\nAs he did in earlier stops, Clinton noted that the polls show the Democrats either locked in close races or trailing \u2014 but he said that was based on the assumption that young people don\u2019t vote."}
