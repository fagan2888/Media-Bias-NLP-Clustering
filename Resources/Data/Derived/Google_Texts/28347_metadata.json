Nobody can screw up the courage to say what he means, and even if he could he had better not. Political correctness has something to do with it, but mostly it\u2019s an inability to confront reality, and the language reflects that. The evidence lies all about. There are no more dead-end streets, but streets with No Outlet. Traffic barriers have been replaced by \u201cimpact attenuators.\u201d The dead have become the \u201cdeceased,\u201d attended not in mortuaries but in \u201cfuneral homes.\u201d The disabled have become the \u201cdifferently abled.\u201d Words, like money, are fungible. Who knew?\n\nThe politicians caught on early. Congress often tries to disguise the meaning of unpopular legislation by calling it something that\u2019s it\u2019s not. This enables congressmen too busy to read the legislation they\u2019re about to enact to get a hint, and hints are usually enough, to what the legislation is all about. The crafty and the clever with words called legislation to nibble at the rights of free men \u201cthe Patriot Act.\u201d Legislation wrecking health care was called the Affordable Care Act, which is turning out to be not very affordable for most Americans, with little thought for actual care.\n\nAliens who jump the line to get ahead of legal immigrants are no longer called what they are, illegal aliens, in bibliographies, the guides to the written word, at the Library of Congress. Sophomores at Dartmouth College petitioned the library to ban the term because it\u2019s \u201cracially charged,\u201d and the librarians meekly surrendered. Another guardian of the language went down for the count. Even the sophomores at Dartmouth were surprised by what sophomore power had wrought. \u201cWe were surprised,\u201d says a third-year sophomore sociology major. \u201c\u2018Illegal alien\u2019\u201d is a dehumanizing, racially charged term. It\u2019s about how we talk about things. The word \u2018alien\u2019 makes undocumented people seem far removed, [like an] extraterrestrial.\u201d Bonnie and Clyde would understand. They didn\u2019t like being called bank robbers, preferring \u201cbank examiners.\u201d Today they might call robbing banks merely \u201cunauthorized withdrawals.\u201d\n\nThe latest wordplay comes from the Department of Justice (some would say that the department itself is inaccurately named), which now shuns accurate descriptions of young criminals lest it hurt their feelings. In an earlier day teenage criminals were described as, well, teenage criminals. Some, like Michael Brown at Ferguson, Mo., who was slain when he tried to disarm a cop after he had robbed a convenience store, were even called \u201cthugs.\u201d Everyone knew what that meant. Young lives mattered, and punishment is necessary to protect everyone else, and it was the first step toward rehabilitation and a better life. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch now calls such young toughs and thugs \u201cjustice-involved youth.\u201d Once upon a time the way to successful rehabilitation was to teach \u201cjustice-involved youth\u201d how to get their lives together, not to spray perfume on the bad things they had done.\n\nPresident Obama wants to make sure that certain lawbreakers do not suffer the stigma of \u201cmislabeling,\u201d and the crimes he considers particularly abhorrent are not necessarily murder, armed robbery, car theft or vandalism, but the production of methamphetamines, and domestic violence. A justice-involved youth should be careful to beat up his neighbor, not his girlfriend, and stick to heroin and coke and leave meth alone. Putting a clean label on a sordid crime, like putting lipstick on a razorback hog, does not alter reality. But it might make a thug feel better about himself on his way to a mark.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This is the age of euphemy, and sophomores rule.
