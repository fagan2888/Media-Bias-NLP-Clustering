Surely a top contender would be the time Jindal, as an up-and-coming Republican governor, delivered his party\u2019s response to President Barack Obama\u2019s first address to a joint session of Congress, back in 2009.\n\nIn a word, it was awful. The stilted choreography, the cheesy slo-mo delivery \u2014 it seemed like our governor was caught in a gravitas-removal machine. Worst of all, he mocked \u201csomething called \u2018volcano monitoring\u2019 \u201d as an example of outlandish federal waste. The top man in Louisiana \u2014 a state rocked repeatedly by disaster and desperately dependent on federal dollars \u2014 made fun of investments in disaster-warning systems that protect mountain communities. (A few weeks later, Alaska\u2019s Mount Redoubt erupted.)\n\nThe performance was widely panned. Now, even Jindal makes fun of it. But that wasn\u2019t Jindal\u2019s worst political gaffe. Not in my book, anyway. That had happened a year and a half earlier, and I bet you\u2019ve never heard about it.\n\nOn Sept. 20, 2007, then-gubernatorial candidate Jindal was campaigning in Shreveport. After a speech to LSU students, he was asked about a massive civil rights march that took place in Jena that day. Jindal\u2019s reply: \u201cWe don\u2019t need anybody to divide us. We certainly don\u2019t need outside agitators to cause problems.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s put that statement in context. The Jena march was formed to protest racial injustice after excessive charges \u2014 attempted murder, no less \u2014 were filed against five black teenagers who beat up a white student at Jena High School. There had been reports of racial tensions at the school in prior weeks \u2014 nooses, for example, had been hung from the \u201cwhite tree\u201d where white students congregated for lunch.\n\nAs the story gained attention, civil rights leaders claimed the black students got a disproportionately heavy charge because of their race and that their treatment was the symptom of a larger problem.\n\nThe Rev. Jesse Jackson got involved and offered this explanation for the march:\n\n\u201cJust as Selma was about the right to vote, and Little Rock was about the right to first-class schools, this is about fairness in criminal justice, which is increasingly unfair. Criminal justice has become an industry \u2026 as in Angola.\u201d\n\nConsidering the international attention that Louisiana\u2019s incarceration \u201cindustry\u201d has (finally) received in recent years, one might admire Jackson\u2019s prescience.\n\nMartin Luther King III and his sister Bernice King were among the estimated 15,000 who marched in Jena. They spoke about the need for both justice and reconciliation, and urged citizens to tell elected officials that \u201cselective justice\u201d will not be tolerated.\n\nSo, while predominantly black crowds marched peacefully, Jindal opted to warn North Louisianans about \u201coutside agitators\u201d who might \u201ccause problems.\u201d\n\n\u201cOutside agitator\u201d is, of course, coded language \u2014 a loaded term. It was a key rhetorical tool used by Southern segregationists who were committed to preserving racist Jim Crow laws. The \u201coutside agitator\u201d myth reinforced the notion that everything would be fine (and separate and unequal) in the South if people from outside the state would mind their own business. Segregationists blamed outsiders for stirring up trouble that wasn\u2019t really there. The argument was used for decades. It\u2019s a line of thinking that sat well with racists such as the contemptible state Rep. Wellborn Jack, D-Shreveport, among many others.\n\nThe Jindal gubernatorial campaign in 2007 was a finely-honed effort that didn\u2019t stray off message. So it\u2019s interesting that Jindal made such a horrendously stupid public utterance. The least charitable interpretation is that he employed race-baiting code words on purpose to scare up votes in North Louisiana. Or, perhaps he is alarmingly ignorant of 20th-century American history.\n\nMy theory is that Jindal made a ham-handed attempt to expropriate the deft dismissal of the \u201coutside agitator\u201d slur embodied in the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s famous letter from Birmingham jail:\n\nMoreover, I am cognizant of the interrelatedness of all communities and states. I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial \u201coutside agitator\u201d idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.\n\nMy hunch is that Jindal or someone on his communications team plucked the phrase from King\u2019s speech without bothering to read the context and supporting argument. Conservatives regularly use King\u2019s words to make policy arguments King would have rejected. For example, in 2003 Jindal told the Times-Picayune he was against affirmative action measures \u2014 \u201cquotas,\u201d as he called them \u2014 and invoked King\u2019s maxim about judging others by the content of their character, not the color of their skin. (King supported policies similar to affirmative action.)\n\nPlucking the \u201coutside agitators\u201d meme from King\u2019s Birmingham letter and carelessly or intentionally using it in a way exactly opposite what King intended is intellectually repulsive, of course. But how else to explain Jindal\u2019s choice of rhetorical code words, his decrying of anyone who might divide \u201cus,\u201d even as King\u2019s daughter and son trod Louisiana soils in a march for justice!\n\nThis is much worse than the volcano-monitoring blunder of 2009. It\u2019s unlikely Jindal even wrote that speech. He was over-coached and worried about talking too fast.\n\nBut the \u201coutside agitators\u201d statement \u2014 that was all him. A 21st-century governor responded to a query about Jena using a term tinged with racism from the Jim Crow era.\n\nSuppose Jindal made that kind of statement during one of his fundraising trips to Florida during the Trayvon Martin furor. Imagine him warning Panhandle residents about the divisiveness of \u201coutside agitators?\u201d National media would have grilled Jindal and eaten him for lunch \u2014 and rightfully so. As he spluttered apologies, his hopes for a place on the 2016 presidential ticket would have gone up in smoke.\n\nBut Jindal never had to explain himself in 2007, because Louisiana media never made much of the blunder. Some Louisiana bloggers, including me, were appalled, but the only mainstream media attention was a Shreveport Times opinion piece by Tannie Lewis Bradley.\n\nSee, back then Jindal was the golden-boy reformer, the dragon-slaying whiz kid, the uncorrupted wonk with contagious \u201cgeek appeal.\u201d Nowadays, media criticism of Jindal is in vogue.\n\nDuring his time in office, his poll numbers have drooped, he has endured political setbacks and controversy, and to many Louisianans, his naked yearning for the White House has become obnoxious, especially given the many messes right here at home.\n\nAs Jindal gets ready to pursue his White House dream in earnest, he can heave a sigh of relief: His biggest political blunder is in the rear-view mirror, and not that many people even noticed when it happened.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Lens", "description": "Remembering the time \u2014 against the backdrop of the Jena protests \u2014 that Jindal revived coded language from the Jim Crow era.", "title": "Jindal\u2019s worst political blunder is one you probably never heard about", "url": "http://thelensnola.org/2014/01/29/jindals-worst-political-blunder-is-one-you-probably-never-heard-about/", "image": "http://thelensnola.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Bobby-Jindal-at-CPAC-140x140.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thelensnola", "card": "summary", "creator": "@moseleylensnola"}, "news_keywords": "Opinion", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6fc2\"", "article_summary": "Gage SkidmoreIf you had to pick Bobby Jindal\u2019s worst political blunder, what would it be?\nWe certainly don\u2019t need outside agitators to cause problems.\u201dLet\u2019s put that statement in context.\nBut the \u201coutside agitators\u201d statement \u2014 that was all him.\nBut that wasn\u2019t Jindal\u2019s worst political gaffe.\nImagine him warning Panhandle residents about the divisiveness of \u201coutside agitators?\u201d National media would have grilled Jindal and eaten him for lunch \u2014 and rightfully so."}
