Vince McAllister missed another roll call vote in the House on Tuesday as fallout from his infidelity scandal continued to escalate, with the husband of the staffer involved in the caught-on-camera incident telling the media that he's leaving his wife and accusing the congressman of destroying his family.\n\nHeath Peacock told \"Inside Edition \" that the conservative freshman lawmaker, who ran for the northeast Louisiana seat as a devoted Christian father of five, is to blame for the problems in his marriage.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had a hand in not only turning my life upside down, but my son\u2019s also. He doesn\u2019t care. He thinks he\u2019s untouchable,\u201d Peacock said, according to a press release from the syndicated tabloid-news program. Peacock's wife, Melissa Hixon Peacock, and McAllister were captured kissing in the congressman's district office by a surveillance camera and the footage was mysteriously leaked and posted online Monday.\n\nSince then, McAllister has issued a short statement asking for \"forgiveness\" and given a more detailed explanation to his hometown newspaper , in which he said he won't resign, admitted to the infidelity and said he and his wife are working through the incident. But he hasn't been seen on Capitol Hill, where his office is locked and he missed two votes Monday and another Tuesday afternoon.\n\nRelated stories: 8 Things to Know About Rep.-Elect Vance McAllister Vance McAllister Kissing Video Could Prompt Flood of GOP Challengers", "article_metadata": {"description": "Rep.
