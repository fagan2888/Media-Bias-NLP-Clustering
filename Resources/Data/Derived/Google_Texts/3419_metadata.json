Facts \u2013 not ideology \u2013 determine reality,\u201d they warn.\n\nThis child-health advocacy group has released a report that determines, among other things:\n\n1. Human sexuality is an objective biological binary trait: \u201cXY\u201d and \u201cXX\u201d are genetic markers of health \u2013 not genetic markers of a disorder.\n\n\u201cThe norm for human design is to be conceived either male or female. Human sexuality is binary by design with the obvious purpose being the reproduction and flourishing of our species,\u201d they observe. \u201cThis principle is self-evident. The exceedingly rare disorders of sexual differentiation (DSDs), including but not limited to testicular feminization and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, are all medically identifiable deviations from the sexual binary norm, and are rightly recognized as disorders of human design. Individuals with DSDs do not constitute a third sex.\u201d\n\n2. No one is born with a gender. Everyone is born with a biological sex. Gender (an awareness and sense of oneself as male or female) is a sociological and psychological concept; not an objective biological one.\n\nLet\u2019s take it a step further. The \u201cgender\u201d phenomenon is, in the larger sense, an artificial and anti-theist-tainted social construct. It\u2019s an overt act of fist-shaking rebellion against the laws of nature and nature\u2019s God.\n\nAnd it\u2019s dangerous.\n\nJohns Hopkins Hospital was the pioneer in \u201cgender reassignment surgery.\u201d It now refuses to perform these discredited cosmetic procedures. Dr. Paul R. McHugh, the hospital\u2019s former psychiatrist-in-chief and current distinguished service professor of psychiatry, is among those who participated in the ACPeds report. He has noted in the past that, as even the left-leaning APA reluctantly acknowledges, transgenderism is a \u201cmental disorder\u201d and that the idea of a \u201csex change\u201d is \u201cbiologically impossible.\u201d \u201cPeople who identify as \u2018feeling like the opposite sex\u2019 or \u2018somewhere in between\u2019 do not comprise a third sex. They remain biological men or biological women,\u201d determines ACPeds.\n\n3. A person\u2019s belief that he or she is something they are not is, at best, a sign of confused thinking.\n\n\u201cWhen an otherwise healthy biological boy believes he is a girl, or an otherwise healthy biological girl believes she is a boy, an objective psychological problem exists that lies in the mind not the body, and it should be treated as such,\u201d notes the report. \u201cThese children suffer from gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria (GD), formerly listed as Gender Identity Disorder (GID), is a recognized mental disorder in the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-V). The psychodynamic and social learning theories of GD/GID have never been disproved.\u201d\n\n4. Puberty is not a disease, and puberty-blocking hormones can be dangerous.\n\n\u201cReversible or not, puberty-blocking hormones induce a state of disease \u2013 the absence of puberty \u2013 and inhibit growth and fertility in a previously biologically healthy child,\u201d notes ACPeds.\n\n5. According to the DSM-V, as many as 98 percent of gender confused boys and 88 percent of gender confused girls eventually accept their biological sex after naturally passing through puberty.\n\nAnd so what do we call a physician or a parent who takes a gender-confused boy, with a 98 percent chance of full recovery, and severely and irrevocably harms that child with dangerous hormones or sterilization surgery?\n\nWe should be calling them what they are: criminals.\n\nTo its credit, the ACPeds report goes on to identify this so-called \u201cgender ideology\u201d for exactly what it is: \u201cChild abuse.\u201d\n\n6. Children who use puberty blockers to impersonate the opposite sex will require cross-sex hormones in late adolescence. Cross-sex hormones are associated with dangerous health risks including but not limited to high blood pressure, blood clots, stroke and cancer.\n\nSo much for the Hippocratic Oath: \u201cPractice two things in your dealings with disease: either help or do not harm the patient.\u201d\n\nGender ideology is anathema to good medicine and sound science.\n\n7. Rates of suicide are 20 times greater among adults who use cross-sex hormones and undergo sex reassignment surgery, even in Sweden which is among the most LGBQT\u2013affirming countries.\n\n\u201cWhat compassionate and reasonable person would condemn young children to this fate knowing that after puberty as many as 88 percent of girls and 98 percent of boys will eventually accept reality and achieve a state of mental and physical health?\u201d the report asks.\n\n8. Conditioning children into believing a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.\n\n\u201cEndorsing gender discordance as normal via public education and legal policies will confuse children and parents, leading more children to present to \u2018gender clinics\u2019 where they will be given puberty-blocking drugs. This, in turn, virtually ensures that they will \u2018choose\u2019 a lifetime of carcinogenic and otherwise toxic cross-sex hormones, and likely consider unnecessary surgical mutilation of their healthy body parts as young adults.\u201d\n\nThere you have it. \u201cGender ideology\u201d is child abuse \u2013 empirically and irrefutably. Isn\u2019t it high time, at least where minors are concerned and as a matter of public policy, that we begin treating it as such?\n\nIf such abuse were associated with anything other than the \u201cLGBQT\u201d political special interests, we already would have.", "article_metadata": {"description": "George Orwell famously wrote, In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.\r\n.05/27/2016 6:07:55AM EST.", "author": "Matt Barber", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "George Orwell famously wrote, In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.", "title": "Matt Barber - \u2018Transgender\u2019 Conditioning is \u2018Child Abuse\u2019", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/mattbarber/2016/03/20/transgender-conditioning-is-child-abuse-n2136616", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/54/f6ac068c-e251-4d6f-9198-2ccf67dd3c4d.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "George Orwell famously wrote, In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.", "title": "Matt Barber - \u2018Transgender\u2019 Conditioning is \u2018Child Abuse\u2019", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/mattbarber/2016/03/20/transgender-conditioning-is-child-abuse-n2136616", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/54/f6ac068c-e251-4d6f-9198-2ccf67dd3c4d.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "\u2018Transgender\u2019 Conditioning is \u2018Child Abuse\u2019, Matt Barber, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Conditioning children into believing a lifetime of chemical and surgical impersonation of the opposite sex is normal and healthful is child abuse.\n\u201cGender ideology\u201d is child abuse \u2013 empirically and irrefutably.\n\u201cReversible or not, puberty-blocking hormones induce a state of disease \u2013 the absence of puberty \u2013 and inhibit growth and fertility in a previously biologically healthy child,\u201d notes ACPeds.\nEveryone is born with a biological sex.\nTo its credit, the ACPeds report goes on to identify this so-called \u201cgender ideology\u201d for exactly what it is: \u201cChild abuse.\u201d6."}
