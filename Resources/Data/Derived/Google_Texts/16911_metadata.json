All hopes of a comeback were dashed when more allegations of post-Congressional sexting emerged. Although Weiner\u2019s wife, Huma Abedin, stood by his side at a press conference in the wake of the scandal, the embarrassing plot thickened when his sexting partner revealed herself to be Sydney Leathers. She then proceeded to reveal plenty of more details about their naughty online relationship. To make matters worse, Weiner\u2019s communications director, Barbara Morgan, went on an expletive-filled rant against a former intern while speaking to a reporter. The uphill battle following the publicity disaster proved too steep to recover from, and Weiner ultimately finished a distant fifth place in the election with just under 5 percent of the city\u2019s vote.\n\nPaula Deen destroys her entire empire with one word\n\nPaula Deen admitted to using the N-word \u2014 but not in a \u201cmean\u201d way \u2014 in a deposition last May after a former restaurant employee filed a lawsuit against the celebrity chef. Deen quickly begged for forgiveness, but that didn\u2019t prevent the Food Network from parting ways with her. Even after a teary-eyed appearance on \u201cToday\u201d aimed at convincing viewers she was not racist, professional relationships with QVC, Sears, Kmart, Target and diabetes drug maker Novo Nordisk soured. The discrimination lawsuit that spurred Deen\u2019s dramatic downfall was amicably resolved in August, and she began making public appearances again in September. Only time will tell if she\u2019ll ever truly be able to move beyond the shadow of one of the mightiest PR messes of 2013.\n\nToronto Mayor Rob Ford addresses drug problem by promising to work on his weight problem\n\nToronto\u2019s trouble with Rob Ford became an American fascination in May when Gawker editor John Cook described a video he had seen featuring the politician smoking crack. The report quickly triggered a media frenzy on both sides of the Canadian border. While Ford denied the allegations, he became a common punchline on late-night programs across the country. Ford finally came clean about using the illegal street drug in November, but instead of promising constituents and critics that he\u2019d get help for his addiction, he made media rounds to address the real problem: His weight.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in any drug treatment programs,\u201d Ford told \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer last month. \u201cI have a weight issue. I\u2019ve been training every day. All I can say, Matt, actions speak louder than words. I invite you to come back. Give me five or six months and if they don\u2019t see a difference, I\u2019ll eat my words.\u201d\n\nAlso more important than rehab? Launching a talk show on television. It was swiftly cancelled, allowing Canada\u2019s most controversial politician more time to focus on his exercise regimen.\n\n\u201c60 Minutes\u201d interviews a witness to the 2012 Benghazi attack\u2026 who didn\u2019t actually witness the attack\n\n\u201c60 Minutes\u201d made an embarrassing mistake in October when it failed to properly vet Dylan Davies, a British security officer claiming to have fought off a terrorist during the 2012 attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. According to multiple incident reports, he was never even there, leading correspondent Lara Logan to issue an apology for the faulty reporting. The apology, however, was not enough for many critics, and lampooned in late-night comedy. Logan and \u201c60 Minutes\u201d producer Max McClellan were prompted to take a leave of absence from the show after a journalistic review inspired CBS News chairman Jeff Fager to \u201cmake adjustments at \u201960 Minutes\u2019 to reduce the chances\u201d of a similar incident happening again.\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act debuts to problem after problem after problem\n\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, was a tough sell from the start, and was constantly challenged by opponents up until the Supreme Court ruled in favor of upholding the law last June. Obama\u2019s administration hoped help from Hollywood could turn the tide of public opinion, but the real opportunity to silence critics came with the launch of the program via HealthCare.gov. Unfortunately, the website was riddled with technical problems and left many Americans unable to enroll, allowing for an encore from the program\u2019s loudest naysayers. While Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius took the fall for the faulty website, the President\u2019s polls took a dive after Americans began receiving cancellation notices for their insurance policies that the new healthcare law rendered inadequate \u2014 a scenario Obama previously promised would not arrive. He apologized and quickly proposed a plan to extend policies that do not meet new government regulations. Still, studies are finding Americans are largely confused by the ACA, and the subject is still a hot topic for political pundits looking to talk a little trash on the Commander in Chief.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Deen_Weiner-Publicity-Disasters-150x150.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Greg Gilman", "description": "Never forget (try not to repeat)", "generator": "WooFramework 6.2.0", "og": {"site_name": "TheWrap", "description": "Never forget (try not to repeat)", "title": "Best & Worst 2013: 5 of the Year's Biggest Publicity Disasters Besides Justine Sacco's AIDS Tweet", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 618, "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Deen_Weiner-Publicity-Disasters.jpg", "height": 412}, "updated_time": "2014-07-10T19:38:31+00:00", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/best-worst-2013-5-memorable-publicity-disasters-year/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Never forget (try not to repeat)", "creator": "@GregAtTheWrap", "url": "http://www.thewrap.com/best-worst-2013-5-memorable-publicity-disasters-year/", "image": {"src": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Deen_Weiner-Publicity-Disasters-340x300.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Deen_Weiner-Publicity-Disasters-340x300.jpg"}, "title": "Best & Worst 2013: 5 of the Year\u2019s Biggest Publicity Disasters Besides Justine Sacco\u2019s AIDS Tweet", "site": "@thewrap", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-12-24T18:45:00+00:00", "sailthru.title": "Best & Worst 2013: 5 of the Year\u2019s Biggest Publicity Disasters Besides Justine Sacco\u2019s AIDS Tweet", "wp-parsely_version": "1.6", "fb": {"app_id": 228236404181023}, "google-site-verification": "-PpFSIrGHybVDxbndrL6MCngw3j6BXdy0xDVBVVOacI", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "section": "Media", "published_time": "2013-12-24T10:45:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-10T19:38:31+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/GregMFnGilman"}, "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Best & Worst 2013: 5 of the Year\u2019s Biggest Publicity Disasters Besides Justine Sacco\u2019s AIDS Tweet\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/best-worst-2013-5-memorable-publicity-disasters-year\\/\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/www.thewrap.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2013\\/12\\/Deen_Weiner-Publicity-Disasters-150x150.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"196637\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-24T18:45:00Z\",\"section\":\"Media\",\"author\":\"Greg Gilman\",\"tags\":[]}", "sailthru.category": "media", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Deen_Weiner-Publicity-Disasters.jpg", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda09a\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019m not in any drug treatment programs,\u201d Ford told \u201cToday\u201d host Matt Lauer last month.\nPresident Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act debuts to problem after problem after problemPresident Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, a.k.a.\nTo make matters worse, Weiner\u2019s communications director, Barbara Morgan, went on an expletive-filled rant against a former intern while speaking to a reporter.\nHe apologized and quickly proposed a plan to extend policies that do not meet new government regulations.\nDeen quickly begged for forgiveness, but that didn\u2019t prevent the Food Network from parting ways with her."}
