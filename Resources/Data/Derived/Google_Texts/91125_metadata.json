Last year, he traveled to Southern California to appear on a panel at a conference sponsored by the Republican mega-donors Charles and David Koch. At one point, according to accounts provided by two sources present, Randy Kendrick, a major contributor and the wife of Ken Kendrick, the owner of the Arizona Diamondbacks, rose to say she disagreed with Kasich\u2019s decision to expand Medicaid coverage, and questioned why he\u2019d expressed the view it was what God wanted.\n\n\n\nThe governor\u2019s response was fiery. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you, lady,\u201d he said as he pointed at Kendrick, his voice rising. \u201cBut when I get to the pearly gates, I\u2019m going to have an answer for what I\u2019ve done for the poor.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe exchange left many stunned. About 20 audience members walked out of the room, and two governors also on the panel, Nikki Haley of South Carolina and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, told Kasich they disagreed with him. The Ohio governor has not been invited back to a Koch seminar \u2014 opportunities for presidential aspirants to mingle with the party\u2019s rich and powerful \u2014 in the months since.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s worth contemplating just how deeply Kasich\u2019s heresy runs. Conservatives disagree about the optimal health-care policy they would implement in a world without political constraints. The closest a Republican can come to insisting upon the need to provide some alternative to Obamacare is to insist that repealing the law is not enough, that the party must put in place an alternative plan as well. A Republican can argue that their alternative plan is better than Obamacare, and that their alternative plan is better than the pre-Obamacare status quo. The thing you cannot say, and remain a Republican in good standing, is that Obamacare is better than the pre-Obamacare status quo.\n\n\n\nBut that is the fissure Kasich exposed. As a governor, the choice he faced was not the hypothetical one that Republicans prefer, between Obamacare and an imagined Republican plan that doesn\u2019t impose costs on anybody. His choice was whether to accept the Medicaid expansion or let poor Ohioans suffer. He chose the former. And he defended his choice by stating that the alternative is cruel and barbaric.\n\nPolitico flags a fiery exchange between GOP presidential hopeful and Ohio Gov.
