And he wants you to know how difficult it was. He even wrote a blog post about it.\n\n\u201cEarlier this afternoon, I sat down to try and enroll in the DC exchange under the president\u2019s health care law,\u201d he wrote. \u201cLike many Americans, my experience was pretty frustrating. After putting in my personal information, I received an error message. I was able to work past that, but when I went to actually sign up for coverage, I got this \u2018internal server error\u2019 screen\u201d: [Here he embedded an image of an internal server error screen.] Despite multiple attempts, I was unable to get past that point and sign up for a health plan. We\u2019ve got a call into the help desk. Guess I\u2019ll just have to keep trying \u2026\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bummer Boehner got that error message. Tyranny almost. But if he\u2019d reached the point at which he was signing up for coverage, it means he\u2019d already had a chance to shop around and pick a plan. His post is oddly quiet about that part of the experience. Which is curious. As a 64-year-old heavy smoker, it\u2019s a marvel Boehner will be able to purchase individual market coverage at all. I wonder what crazy law guarantees that he can?\n\nAt any rate, since he didn\u2019t disclose which plan he\u2019d settled on, or what his options were, I thought I\u2019d try to re-create his experience for you. So on Thursday night I possibly perjured myself, and created an account on D.C.\u2019s health insurance exchange for a nonexistent 64-year-old man seeking individual coverage.\n\nBecause he\u2019s shopping on the D.C. exchange, and not in Ohio under Healthcare.gov, I am assuming that his wife, Debbie Boehner, a real estate agent in suburban Cincinnati, has her own coverage, and so he\u2019s not purchasing a spousal plan.\n\nIt turns out, Boehner, who as speaker makes $223,500 a year, has a lot of affordable options to choose from.\n\nThe cheapest policy for a 64-year-old is a high-deductible, bronze-plated BlueCross BlueShield plan with a $372.14 premium.\n\nJust under 2 percent of Boehner\u2019s income. Not bad for a man on the cusp of his golden years!\n\nNow Boehner just had a birthday, so in less than a year he\u2019ll qualify for Medicare. If I were him, I\u2019d probably take my chances with a cheap plan like this one and pocket the savings for my retirement, which could come as early as January 2015. Who\u2019s to say?\n\nThen again, Boehner has a stressful job, and that smoking habit. Plus, his net worth is in the low millions. Under the circumstances (and since he\u2019ll only be enrolled for a year anyhow) it might be worth it for him to purchase something more expensive.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The ACA is actually a great deal for a 64-year-old smoker with a high-stress job.
