Jordan Cronkrite had two first-half touchdowns and Kelvin Taylor's long run in the fourth quarter helped No. 11 Florida hold off South Carolina 24-14 on Saturday.

The Gators (9-1, 7-1 Southeastern Conference) were up 17-0 heading to the fourth quarter, with the defense having allowed only 44 yards.

But South Carolina (3-7, 1-7) rallied with a throwback 17-yard touchdown from receiver Pharoh Cooper to quarterback Perry Orth, followed by Orth's 38-yard scoring throw to Cooper moments later that cut the lead to 17-14 with 4:49 remaining.

Florida was facing third-and-8 from midfield when Taylor broke free on a 53-yard run to the South Carolina 1. He finished the drive a play later with 2:01 left that closed the door on South Carolina.

Cronkrite scored on a 3-yard run and a 41-yard reception from quarterback Treon Harris.
