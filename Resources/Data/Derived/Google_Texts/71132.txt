North Henderson's Logan Spellicy didn't start the season on the varsity soccer squad, but he's there now and he's making his presence known.

On Wednesday night, the sophomore scored North's lone goal in a 1-0 victory over rival West Henderson. Spellicy was brought up from the junior varsity because the Knights have been riddled with injuries.

He's scored two goals this season so far and both have been game-winners. The first came at home against North Buncombe, and the second against West on Wednesday night.

“It felt amazing,” the sophomore said of the goal on Wednesday night. “I just knew I had to put the ball in. We had to win.”

And that's how Spellicy attacks the field, North coach Wayne Nock said. He's a spark plug alongside leading goal scorer Mario Robles.

“He's just electric on the field,” the coach said.

The match was a stalemate when Spellicy put the ball in the goal at the 17:49 mark in the second half. The goal came at a time when North (8-8-1, 3-4-1) needed it the most.

West was in full-blown attack mode early as five different times a shot was fired at North goalie Celedonia Cardenas. Cardenas made the five saves, but four of the balls came off of his hands. The Falcons (8-8, 2-5) had opportunities but couldn't take advantage.

And that's plagued West over the last four matches, coach Brian Brewer said. He's got hope that that will change soon. The Falcons were scoring gobs of goals early in the season.

“At some point and time, that offense that was scoring a bunch of goals at the beginning of the season will erupt,” Brewer said.

As for North, Nock is happy with what he saw on Wednesday night.

“They were making us earn every touch,” he said. “Our guys dug deep.”

West will play at Smoky Mountain on Monday. North will host Tuscola on Wednesday.
