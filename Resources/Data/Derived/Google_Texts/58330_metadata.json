She requested that the principals of each school inform the teachers that their supplements will be less than expected due to cuts in state funding.\n\nThe district\u2019s funding difficulties, Miller said, are due to a $1.1 million loss in Minimum Foundation Program revenue and higher-than-expected insurance costs.\n\nMiller said the loss in MFP funding, which is based on a state formula for financing each student during a school year, was due to a reduction in anticipated student enrollment.\n\nMiller declined to detail how many students actually enrolled in district schools this year.\n\nShe said that the district\u2019s insurance costs increased perhaps because of the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cYou had more employees adding family members because of that, so our health care costs also rose,\u201d said Miller.\n\nSt. Landry Parish experienced a similar budget crisis in in July 2011 when the district declared a financial exigency or emergency after Miller predicted a $4 million deficit.\n\nSeveral months later, Superintendent Mike Nassif resigned and in 2012 the board saved money mainly by reducing maintenance costs.\n\nSince then, the district has finished the fiscal year with budget surpluses.\n\nIn an interview on Thursday, Superintendent Edward Brown said he and other school officials spent about 90 minutes earlier in the day discussing financial issues.\n\nMiller said she told the board\u2019s Finance Committee about this year\u2019s possible deficit, but no action was taken on the matter, and it was not discussed at last week\u2019s regular meeting.\n\nBrown said he is concerned about the amount of money the district is spending on substitute teachers.\n\nThe board\u2019s committees are scheduled to meet again on Monday, Miller said.\n\nBrown said that he and his central office advisers are devising ways to deal with the projected deficit and their proposals will be presented at the June regular meeting.\n\nIn another matter, the board listened to representatives from three companies who made separate presentations about how to save money on energy costs.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Baton Rouge, LA /News/Acadiana/: OPELOUSAS \u2013  The St. Landry Parish School Board was told during a special meeting on Thursday that the district anticipates a $3 million deficit by the end of the 2015-16 fiscal year.
