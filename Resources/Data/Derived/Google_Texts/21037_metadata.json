OK, maybe a little. But I was also trying to convey my impatience with our bipolar political discourse, with the idea that I was required to pick a team. I was trying to preserve for myself the right to think a thing through and come to my own conclusion regardless of ideological branding.\n\nBut at the same time, I knew what I was being asked. When they said, \u201cAre you liberal or are you conservative?\u201d those words had concrete meaning, embodied real political concepts.\n\nBut that is no longer the case \u2014 at least where the latter term is concerned.\n\nOnce upon a time, when a person identified as conservative, you knew the ideas he or she meant to convey \u2014 low taxes, small government, resistance to social change. But a word that once encoded a definite set of values and beliefs now seems utterly bereft of internal cohesion, less a name for an ideology than for a mood: surly, nasty and put-upon.\n\nThey don\u2019t like the rest of us. Nor do they seem to like each other all that much, feuding with a bitterness and constancy that would make even the Hatfields and McCoys tell them to tone it down. Yes, ideology still gets lip service, but its importance has become secondary, if that.\n\nHow else to explain that people who once considered Christian faith their foundation stone have coalesced behind a candidate who can\u2019t name a Bible verse? Or that people who once valued a grown-up, clear-eyed approach to foreign policy support candidates who want to \u201ccarpet bomb\u201d the Middle East and pull out of NATO? Or that people who once decried \u201ca culture of victimization\u201d now whine all day about how they are victims of biased media, bullying gays and political correctness?\n\nHow to explain that people who once vowed to safeguard American moral decency from the nefarious irreverence of liberals \u2014 think President Bush chastising \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in the era of \u201cfamily values\u201d \u2014 now put forth candidates who tell penis jokes?\n\nA few days ago New York Times, columnist David Brooks professed to be excited by this act of self-immolation \u2014 \u201cThis is a wonderful moment to be a conservative,\u201d he gushed \u2014 because after this debacle, conservatives will be able to reinvent themselves, unencumbered by \u201cexisting mental categories and presuppositions.\u201d Like when a comic book or movie franchise gets re-booted, I suppose. One had the sense of a man desperately painting lipstick on a pig.\n\nThe right is rotting from within, putrefying on its own grievance and rage. It seems bereft of core values and beliefs unless you count its determination to always oppose anything the left supports, up to and including motherhood and sunshine. That\u2019s as close to principle as conservatives come these days.\n\nGiven the way they have spurned their party\u2019s 2012 election \u201cautopsy\u201d report, which called for greater inclusion and a gentler tone, one wonders if these folks are capable of, or even interested in, the reinvention Brooks predicts. Conservatives do not need to be \u201cliberal-lite\u201d \u2014 no ideology has a monopoly on good ideas. On the other hand, when your base is the Ku Klux Klan, Ted Nugent and people sucker-punching strangers at rallies, it\u2019s a sign that a little self-reflection is overdue.\n\n\u201cAre you liberal or are you conservative?\u201d\n\nI had a smart aleck answer 20 years ago. But it occurs to me that if they asked that now, I\u2019d have to request clarification. My worldview hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nBut I no longer have any idea what \u201cconservative\u201d means.\n\n(Leonard Pitts is a columnist for The Miami Herald, 1 Herald Plaza, Miami, Fla., 33132.
