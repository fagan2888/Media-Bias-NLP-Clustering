CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\n\nMany of us may glance at a glowing Apple on the back of a laptop screen and sense innovation, an artsy-hip kid, or Steve Jobs. Or perhaps you\u2019re repulsed by a Coca-Cola label due to the company\u2019s crimes in third-world countries, similarly to how you might avoid eye contact with an enemy. That\u2019s because humans often perceive brands with the same psychological mechanism that\u2019s used to recognize faces, according to a new survey out of the Institute for Experimental Business Psychology at Leuphana University of L\u00fcneburg in Germany.\n\nIn the study, the researchers had participants view 16 common brands, including Coca-Cola, Rolex, Porsche, and Apple. They then measured their reaction to 18 computer-generated human faces and compared and contrasted the psychological mechanisms behind recognition. The participants were asked to evaluate both the brands and the faces based on trustworthiness, care, strength, or assertiveness \u2014 emotions or attributes that can be used to describe humans, but also companies.\n\nThey found that the participants relied on two main aspects in identifying their feelings about both brand and face: trustworthiness and the impression of strength \u2014 both of which can be associated with detecting intentions, whether they are good or bad, the authors concluded.\n\n\u201cThe results of this study enhance the findings of previous research that in many ways brands are perceived similarly as humans,\u201d the authors wrote. \u201cThis yields a fruitful basis for further investigations on how brand perception is formed and can be influenced.\u201d\n\nThis is why celebrities are used to advertise certain brands as a way to increase trust for the product. Or also perhaps why negative figures, like Subway Jared, are booted from campaigns immediately after breaking public trust.\n\n\u201cIn advertising campaigns the choice of a brand face that represents a personality that is coherent with the intended brand personality may make up the difference between a strong and a weak brand, and even may have an impact on economic success of brand management,\u201d the authors wrote.\n\nWhile the study is mainly meant to help brand designers come up with effective advertising campaigns, we might be able to glean more from it on a psychological level. We can gauge our own reactions to certain brands better if we realize that ads often manipulate us with celebrity faces to build good impressions of trust and strength \u2014 when in reality there may be negative aspects of the brand beneath the surface. The face of Coca-Cola \u2014 the polar bears \u2014 may be adorable, but the company itself is not.\n\nSource: Lange A, H\u00f6ger R. Do Brands and Faces share the same Perceptual Space?
