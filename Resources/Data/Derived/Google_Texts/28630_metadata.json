There are new forms that have been created to address it, such as the 1094-B and C, and 1095-B and C. I believe the most important thing for accountants at this time is to educate their tax clients and their business clients about the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nBhansali thinks it\u2019s important to be proactive. \u201cWe have observed that most people don\u2019t start things proactively,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the peak of the tax season, they get bombarded by their clients about all these questions. So it is extremely important, we believe, that they should start sending emails and newsletters to their clients about this.\u201d\n\nHe noted that AccountantsWorld provides newsletters to clients who use its Website Relief system. \u201cAs part of the website, we provide them electronic newsletters that go on their website so clients can get educated,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that is going to be one very important thing.\u201d\n\nAnother important matter relates to business tax returns.\n\n\u201cI talked to about seven or eight accountants in the last two to three weeks about how much time they spend,\u201d said Bhansali. \u201cBefore they can do their business tax returns, they have to close the books. About 25 to 30 percent of small businesses don\u2019t use any accounting system. They write manual checks and then they dump everything on their accountant\u2019s desk\u2014all their canceled checks and bank statements\u2014sometimes in January and sometimes as late as February. And accountants struggle to close the books at that time when they\u2019re busy with other tax returns.\u201d\n\nHe estimates that many accountants need to spend 20 to 30 percent of their time closing the books for their small business clients.\n\n\u201cThat creates a total catastrophe during tax season, as you can understand,\u201d said Bhansali. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason accountants are so busy.\u201d\n\nHe noted that his company\u2019s client write-up system, part of the cloud-based Accounting Power, enables accountants to spread that work throughout the year so it doesn\u2019t interfere with tax season.\n\n\u201cRather than waiting for clients to bring in their canceled checks and credit card statements and bank statements, accountants can download the data from banks and credit card institutions right into the write-up system on a regular basis,\u201d said Bhansali.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.accountingtoday.com/blogs/debits-credits/news/getting-ready-for-tax-season-and-year-end-crunch-76220-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.accountingtoday.com/media/ui/webcpa-socialshare-logo.png", "site_name": "Debits & Credits", "title": "Getting Ready for Tax Season and Year-End Crunch"}, "google-site-verification": "j5muKh-DQfTuFwnYFV7lcz1jyUXULO2A4sj9MiXsHc4", "description": "AccountantsWorld CEO Dr. Chandra Bhansali is warning about the tax season crunch that many accountants will be facing in a few months when their clients come in to not only do their taxes, but also close the books on their small businesses, while getting help complying with the Affordable Care Act.", "news_keywords": "accountantsworld, chandra bhansali, tax season, affordable care act, aca", "title": "Getting Ready for Tax Season and Year-End Crunch"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb5d4\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI believe that is going to be one very important thing.\u201dAnother important matter relates to business tax returns.\n\u201cBefore they can do their business tax returns, they have to close the books.\n\u201cAt the peak of the tax season, they get bombarded by their clients about all these questions.\n\u201cThat creates a total catastrophe during tax season, as you can understand,\u201d said Bhansali.\n\u201cAs part of the website, we provide them electronic newsletters that go on their website so clients can get educated,\u201d he said."}
