In reality, it makes some headaches.\n\nParticipants of the Chatfield Reservoir Reallocation Project took their turn before the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission in Lamar on Friday, formally presenting the \u201cFish, Wildlife and Recreation Mitigation Plan\u201d essential for approval of the proposal to double the water storage in the south Denver reservoir. The presentation started the 60-day review clock for commission approval required by state statute and offered a closer look at the likely impacts to one of Colorado\u2019s most popular state parks.\n\n\u201cNo water project is without environmental impacts and the statute doesn\u2019t require that the impacts be eliminated, it requires that we mitigate them,\u201d said Mike King, executive director of Colorado\u2019s Department of Natural Resources. \u201c(The participants and stakeholders) are to be commended for being creative in getting us to this point. I\u2019m hopeful that we can get this across the finish line in the next couple of months.\u201d\n\nThe hurdles to be overcome at Chatfield range far beyond the environmental, however. The 1,423-acre reservoir and surrounding topography serve as a cornerstone of the state park system, annually attracting more than 1.5 million visitors and generating some $2.2 million in revenue. Impacts to the park during and after inundation of 587 additional acres are expected to be significant.\n\nWide fluctuations in water levels are anticipated as additional municipal and agricultural water storage join the reservoir\u2019s current primary uses of flood control and recreation. An additional 12 vertical feet of potential water fluctuations is likely to have considerable impact on park operations and will require the relocation of multiple facilities when the reservoir fills to its new level.\n\nThe law does not require that a mitigation plan for recreation impacts be approved by the commission, however project participants have proposed plans to alleviate unavoidable impacts to recreation facilities and amenities.\n\n\u201cAreas that were recognized as being potentially impacted included the park, fish and wildlife, recreation and financial,\u201d said Randy Knutson, board member of the Central Colorado Water Conservancy District. \u201cMitigation plans for all these impacts either have been developed or are in the development phases.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe feel that we\u2019ve gone above and beyond the state law requirement,\u201d added Randy Ray, water resources manager for the Centennial Water & Sanitation District. \u201cThis plan addresses all the concerns.\u201d\n\nWhile the 11 project participants have pledged up to $116 million to finance the potential impacts identified in studies by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Colorado Parks and Wildlife, concerns remain. Foremost among them is the reservoir\u2019s dramatically fluctuating water level.\n\nUnder the state park\u2019s current operating agreement with Denver Water, Chatfield typically fluctuates no more than five feet between Memorial Day and Labor Day, offering recreational users reliable water levels for boating, fishing and other summer activities. The \u201cFish, Wildlife and Recreation Mitigation Plan\u201d notes that the new \u201cfluctuation zone\u201d could be up to 21 feet, citing a comparison study of six other Front Range reservoirs showing that impacts (mud, weeds, mosquitoes, etc.) would be negligible.\n\nProject participants insist that the reallocation proposal will have a positive impact on the South Platte River downstream from Chatfield, including an improved fishery as water is conveyed to downstream users from mid to late summer and through fall and winter. The \u201cnew reservoir\u201d effect of added nutrients also has potential to improve fishing within Chatfield in the short term, although fluctuating water levels have been associated with elevated mercury levels in walleye at other reservoirs.\n\nReallocation participants have agreed to maintain water levels in the reservoir during critical walleye and smallmouth bass spawn periods. They also announced a new plan to preserve a gravel pond popular among recreational users that was initially subject to inundation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing process. I feel better about some of the changes that they\u2019ve made but we\u2019ve got 60 days still to work through some of the details,\u201d said Ken Kehmeier, a CPW aquatic biologist working on the project. \u201cBottom line is that it won\u2019t be the Chatfield that everybody knows right now.\u201d\n\nScott Willoughby: swilloughby@denverpost.com or twitter.com/willoughbydp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Willoughby: Chatfield Reservoir expansion plan in hands of commission", "title": "Willoughby: Chatfield Reservoir expansion plan in hands of commission", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/11/16/willoughby-chatfield-reservoir-expansion-plan-in-hands-of-commission/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131117__Chatfield-Reservoirp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131117__Chatfield-Reservoirp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-11-16T19:34:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T16:21:27+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd40c1\"", "article_summary": "LAMAR \u2014 Philosophically, the proposed water storage expansion of Chatfield Reservoir makes some sense.\nThe law does not require that a mitigation plan for recreation impacts be approved by the commission, however project participants have proposed plans to alleviate unavoidable impacts to recreation facilities and amenities.\nParticipants of the Chatfield Reservoir Reallocation Project took their turn before the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission in Lamar on Friday, formally presenting the \u201cFish, Wildlife and Recreation Mitigation Plan\u201d essential for approval of the proposal to double the water storage in the south Denver reservoir.\nReallocation participants have agreed to maintain water levels in the reservoir during critical walleye and smallmouth bass spawn periods.\n\u201cBottom line is that it won\u2019t be the Chatfield that everybody knows right now.\u201dScott Willoughby: swilloughby@denverpost.com or twitter.com/willoughbydp"}
