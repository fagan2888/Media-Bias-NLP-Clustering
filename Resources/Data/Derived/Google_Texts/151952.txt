White House officials do not believe terrorism is behind the incident at a D.C. Metro station Monday that claimed one life and injured 60 more.

One woman died and dozens more were injured after smoke filled the L’Enfant Plaza Station and forced the closure of that station and several others in the Metro system. The National Transportation Safety Board is heading up an investigation.

“The early indications are this did not involve terrorism but involved a mechanical failure that occurred,” White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters.
