Yet it will be the most decisive question in the 2016 presidential election. Since the last presidential election, the major provisions of the Affordable Care Act have taken effect. Millions of people are now enrolled in Medicaid, or are receiving health insurance subsidies through state exchanges, who were not enrolled or subsidized in November of 2012. Obamacare skeptics may disparage these benefits as inefficient, counter-productive, and excessively costly. Fine. Those who receive them won\u2019t cherish them any less. The mortgage-interest deduction is not exactly a model of economic rationality. Try taking it away. Go ahead. Try. Related Story The State-Level Future of Healthcare Reform Exact numbers of Obamacare beneficiaries are difficult to compute. However, healthcare economists estimate 11.2 million added to the Medicaid program since open enrollment under ACA began, and 10 million receiving subsidies through exchanges. And, since 2010, an estimated 5.7 million young adults between the ages of 19 and 25 gained coverage, mostly through their parents\u2019 plans. If the ACA were repealed without a replacement, one would expect most or all of these people to lose their coverage. Repeal of the ACA is the declared goal of all Republican presidential candidates. While most have some vision of replacement, that vision tends to be highly unspecific\u2014and still likely to radically reduce the coverage Obamacare now provides.\n\nJeb Bush is probably the least fire-breathing opponent of the Affordable Care Act among the Republican candidates, as worried conservatives have anxiously noted. He consistently emphasizes \u201creplacement\u201d alongside \u201crepeal.\u201d But when he speaks in anything like detail, as he did in Iowa in March, this is what he says: The effort by the state, by the government, ought to be to try to create catastrophic coverage, where ... if you have a hardship that goes way beyond your means of paying for it, that you have\u2014the government is there or an entity is there to help you deal with that. The rest of it ought to be shifted back where individuals are empowered to make more decisions themselves. That\u2019s consensus conservative doctrine. Yet to a current ACA beneficiary it must sound ominous. \u201cIf you have a hardship that goes way beyond your means of paying for it \u2026\u201d Even small proposed changes in Medicare have up-ended American politics. Back in 1995, the government of the United States shut down for a total of 27 days over budget fights that included a disagreement over $11 per month in Medicare Part B premiums. That shutdown framed the election of 1996, in which Bill Clinton won a second term, while Republicans lost two seats in the House (offset by a gain of two in the Senate). Many millions of Americans have much more at stake in 2016 than $11 a month. How will their interest sway the election? A couple of maps compiled by the Center for Equitable Growth offer some clues: Medicaid Expansion Particularly Benefits Poor Regions of the United States Washington Center for Equitable Growth Not all states have taken part in the Medicaid expansion. The Supreme Court ruling upholding the constitutionality of the ACA also recognized the right of states to opt-out from the Medicaid component of the law, a right that 16 states have exercised, and another five continue to discuss. Most of the states that have expanded Medicaid would be expected to go blue in 2016 anyway. But not all: Ohio, for example, without which no GOP nominee has ever won the presidency; Indiana, for another, the reddest state in the Midwest; and Arkansas, Kentucky, Nevada, North Dakota, and West Virginia. Affordable Care Act Subsidy Benefits Are Concentrated In The South Washington Center for Equitable Growth Unless the Supreme Court strikes down subsidies in the federal exchange in the pending case of King v. Burwell, ACA insurance subsidies are paid everywhere in the country. As the next map shows, eligibility for subsidy is concentrated in the red states. Not all of those eligible claim the subsidy. Many of those who do receive subsidies might be expected to vote Democratic in 2016 even if healthcare were not an issue. But some Republican-leaning voters will feel the hit\u2014and especially in a tightly balanced state like Florida, that hit could have real consequences.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican candidates need to address the concerns of millions of Americans terrified that they will lose their health insurance.", "author": "David Frum", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Republican candidates need to address the concerns of millions of Americans terrified that they will lose their health insurance.", "title": "The Question That Will Decide the 2016 Election", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2015/04/RTR4S23G/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/the-question-that-will-decide-the-2016-election/391137/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1adb\"", "article_summary": "Since the last presidential election, the major provisions of the Affordable Care Act have taken effect.\nYet it will be the most decisive question in the 2016 presidential election.\nJeb Bush is probably the least fire-breathing opponent of the Affordable Care Act among the Republican candidates, as worried conservatives have anxiously noted.\nMany of those who do receive subsidies might be expected to vote Democratic in 2016 even if healthcare were not an issue.\n\u201cWill you take away my health insurance?\u201d That question does not get asked often at Republican presidential forums."}
