Both attended the oral arguments at the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Obama administration weighed in on the marriage litigation before the Supreme Court in a friend-of-the-court brief calling for a ruling that would strike down all remaining bans on same-sex marriage around the country.\n\nAsked whether Obama sees such a ruling as a possible decision from the court, Earnest again declined to make a prediction about the ruling and talked about the strength of the federal government\u2019s argument.\n\n\u201cAgain, we\u2019re going to let the Supreme Court decide, but Don Verrilli made a very cogent and persuasive argument about what he believes, and what the federal government believes, should be the outcome here,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cAt this point, I\u2019m not going to try to distill the arguments that he was making in this setting. I\u2019ll just say that we feel very confident in the strength of the legal argument that he made, but we\u2019ll let the Supreme Court decide as they should.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declined to make a prediction on the outcome of marriage litigation before the U.S. Supreme Court.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Blade: Gay News, Politics, LGBT Rights", "description": "White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declined to make a prediction on the outcome of marriage litigation before the U.S. Supreme Court.", "title": "White House 'very confident' about arguments on marriage", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 460, "identifier": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2014/04/Josh_Earnest_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "height": 470}, "updated_time": "2015-04-29T17:50:34-04:00", "url": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/2015/04/29/white-house-very-confident-about-legal-arguments-on-marriage/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declined to make a prediction on the outcome of marriage litigation before the U.S. Supreme Court.", "creator": "@chrisjohnson82", "image": "http://www.washingtonblade.com/content/files/2014/04/Josh_Earnest_460x470_c_Washington_Blade_by_Michael_Key.jpg", "title": "White House 'very confident' about arguments on marriage", "site": "@WashBlade", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 13357499221}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/WashingtonBlade", "section": "homepage news", "tag": "White House", "published_time": "2015-04-29T17:33:42-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-29T17:50:34-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "news_keywords": "gay news, Washington Blade, gay marriage, Josh Earnest"}, "article_summary": "Earnest said President Obama was briefed on the arguments by White House counsel Neil Eggleston and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett.\n\u201cI have previously warned against drawing conclusions about what the Supreme Court will decide based exclusively on the public arguments,\u201d Earnest said.\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest declined to make a prediction Wednesday on the outcome of marriage litigation before the U.S. Supreme Court, but said the administration remains \u201cvery confident\u201d in the aftermath of oral arguments about the case presented by the federal government.\nBoth attended the oral arguments at the Supreme Court.\nI\u2019ll just say that we feel very confident in the strength of the legal argument that he made, but we\u2019ll let the Supreme Court decide as they should.\u201d"}
