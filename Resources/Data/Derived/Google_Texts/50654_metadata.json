Snapchat, YouTube and Twitter also had more than 20% of teen \u201chyperusers.\u201d\n\nTwice as many pre-teens and teens use Facebook than use Snapchat, Pinterest or Tumblr. And the combined number of teenage Instagram and WhatApp users still isn\u2019t as high as the number of teens on Facebook.\n\nOther studies, like this teen social media privacy study by Pew Research, have shown that Facebook\u2019s popularity among teens has decreased. But Forrester researcher Nate Elliott cautioned that there are gaps between actual social usage and what is reported.\n\nBusinesses and marketers who are looking to attract pre-teen and teenage consumers should take note of these trends when making their youth-targeted strategies.\n\nIt is important to look at the entire picture when making social media strategies. Even if the number of Facebook users does drop, keep in mind how many users are still active and how engaged those users are.\n\nGet Free Updates!
