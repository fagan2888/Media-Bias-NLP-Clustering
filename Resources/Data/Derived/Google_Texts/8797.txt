Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vermont Independent, said that while the economy is better off than it was six years ago, he would have been more aggressive than the president in confronting the big banks after the 2008 financial crisis.

“I would have been stronger than President Obama in a number of areas,” Mr. Sanders said at an event Mondayat the Brookings Institution. “I think he missed the opportunity, politically, of doing what Roosevelt did when he was elected and making it clear to the American people what is happening and why.”

Mr. Sanders was responding to the question of what he would have done that the country didn’t do to get the economy moving again looking back on the last six years.

“What Roosevelt said was ‘the economic royalists hate me and I welcome their hatred,” Mr. Sanders said. “I think that’s what President Obama should have [said]: ‘These people have destroyed millions of lives because of their greed and recklessness. I will take them on and we’re going to rebuild an economy [so] that it works for all people and not just the very wealthy.”

Mr. Sanders said he voted for the Affordable Care Act, commonly referred to as Obamacare, and that it’s done some good things, but that he would have tried to fight for a single-payer system, or at least “greatly expanding” Medicare to make it simpler and more inclusive.

Mr. Sanders also said during a question-and-answer session that he does not plan to attend Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s upcoming address to a joint session of Congress, which some congressional Democrats are likening to a slap at Mr. Obama by House Speaker John A. Boehner, who extended the invitation.
