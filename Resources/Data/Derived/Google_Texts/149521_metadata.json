They have set up 50 traps across Tulsa County then wait, picking up the traps a week later.\n\nThe good news?\n\n\"Strangely enough the mosquitoes that carry West Nile virus proliferate and do well in years where it's hot and dry, they like the dirty nasty water that's been sitting around for months and weeks at a time,\" said Scott Meador.\n\nThe bad news? Other types of mosquitoes thrive in wet weather conditions.\n\n\"There are other species of mosquitoes that are high in numbers and voracious biters,\" said Scott Meador.\n\nSo while the risk for breeding virus-carrying pests may be lower, the so called \"biters\" will soon be out in full force.\n\nThe Tulsa County Health Department's solution, dump out, drain and dry up any standing water and clean up wet leaf litter.\n\n\"If you don't have water, mosquitoes can't breed and reproduce,\" said Scott Meador.\n\nThe Tulsa County Health Department says they typically see mosquitoes that carry West Nile during mid to late summer.\n\nTulsa County Health Department - Mosquito Information", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-17", "Description": "Rain, rain and more rain means most of northeast Oklahoma is having a wet spring.While the rain is great for drought conditions, it is creating a perfect environment for mosquitoes.", "author": "Erin Conrad", "og": {"url": "http://www.newson6.com/story/29028885/health-department-ramps-up-mosquito-control-efforts", "image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/7727311_G.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Rain, rain and more rain means most of northeast Oklahoma is having a wet spring.While the rain is great for drought conditions, it is creating a perfect environment for mosquitoes.", "title": "Health Department Ramps Up Mosquito Control Efforts"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KOTV.images.worldnow.com/images/7727311_G.jpg", "description": "Rain, rain and more rain means most of northeast Oklahoma is having a wet spring.While the rain is great for drought conditions, it is creating a perfect environment for mosquitoes.", "card": "summary", "title": "Health Department Ramps Up Mosquito Control Efforts"}, "wnreadableurl": "health-department-ramps-up-mosquito-control-efforts", "ROBOTS": "index,follow,noarchive", "owner": "KOTV", "fb": {"app_id": 497059410331845}, "date": "2015/05/11", "KEYWORDS": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS25", "verify-v1": "67+ifqPKEX7ZTB2sopjxTD1c6nx6ScxupNN92EqnIpc=", "news_keywords": "tulsa,media,news,weather,tv,cbs,local,tornado,storm,oklahoma,kotv.com,channel 6,channel six,green country,television,the news on 6,the news on six,six in the morning,live"}, "article_summary": "Tulsa County Health Department - Mosquito Information\nThe Tulsa County Health Department is gearing up and takes mosquito season seriously.\nThe Tulsa County Health Department says they typically see mosquitoes that carry West Nile during mid to late summer.\nThe Tulsa County Health Department's solution, dump out, drain and dry up any standing water and clean up wet leaf litter.\nThey have set up 50 traps across Tulsa County then wait, picking up the traps a week later."}
