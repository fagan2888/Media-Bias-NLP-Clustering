However, rising patient out-of-pocket expenses \u2013 expected to reach $420 billion in 2015 \u2013 are just beginning to show their effects. Healthcare providers will need to address this growing issue head-on if they hope to stay profitable and stay in business.\n\nDue to factors such as the Affordable Care Act and health insurers' aspiration for continual quarter-on-quarter earnings growth in a mature market, it is increasingly common for patient deductibles to be upward of $5,000 for in-network providers, and $10,000 for out-of-network providers \u2013 which for ACA plans includes many if not most specialists.\n\nToday, patients often have co-insurance rates as high as 30 percent. Yet given that 62 percent of Americans have less than $1,000 in savings, many patients lack the liquidity to cover these out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nSome may borrow from loved ones or creditors to pay bills; others may neglect them entirely\u2014translating to losses for medical providers that refuse to update their business practices.\n\nHealthcare providers should consider taking the following steps to mitigate these effects and minimize loss:\n\nVerify insurance coverage\n\nProviders should always verify patient coverage and that the plan is active just prior to all visits and procedures. During verification, providers should inquire about the patient\u2019s un-met deductible, co-payment, and co-insurance responsibilities.\n\nCollect the patient's responsibility at the time of service\n\nOn average, claims processing, payments, billing, bad debt and other aspects of revenue cycle management cost the healthcare industry $315 billion annually\u2014with providers taking the brunt of these expenses.\n\nBy requiring that all patients fulfill their financial responsibility at the time of service, medical providers can simultaneously transfer the financial risk to entities such as banks that are in the business of lending and collecting money, and decrease billing-related expenses for the medical provider.\n\nAdditionally, the medical provider may also reduce frivolous malpractice claims filed solely to avoid payment by not having to collect from the patient after the time of service.\n\nObtain an accurate estimate of allowable amounts\n\nIt is critical for providers to use accurate estimates when collecting the patient responsibility, as inaccuracies can generate added follow-up expenses, such as refunds and bills, which may turn profitable procedures into losses. Since obtaining current allowable amounts directly from payers can be challenging, to say the least, providers should use software tools that assess historical data and estimate allowable expenses for specific payers and procedures.\n\nEducate patients\n\nWhen presenting the estimated allowable for a procedure, or collecting for a visit at the time of service, providers should use the interaction as an opportunity to educate patients so that they may better understand both their coverage and financial responsibility.\n\nIt is very helpful to provide handouts (bi-lingual) that clearly define key terms such as premium, co-pay, deductible, co-insurance, and allowable.\n\nDe-code the codes\n\nProvider billing systems and CMS claim forms were traditionally designed for communicating with insurers, listing secret codes and meaningless usual and customary fees. CPT and ICD-10 codes are difficult for patients to understand, and the usual and customary billed charges only cause confusion.\n\nProviders should include layman\u2019s descriptions for codes, and a plain language calculation of the estimated patient responsibility, so that patients can understand why they are writing a check.\n\nSimplify the collection process\n\nFor providers that collect from a patient following a procedure, rather than at the time of service, it is imperative to simplify the collection process; this not only maximizes revenue and reduces days in A/R, but also increases the likelihood that the patient will return for future visits.\n\nProviders should look for opportunities to consolidate bills and improve collection communications, including: summarizing services alongside the status of insurance claims, clearly indicating what is due, providing multiple payment options - such as online and phone bill pay - to meet patients\u2019 personal preferences, and providing contact information to engage with patients who have questions.\n\nDiscussing financial responsibility is a sensitive part of the patient-provider relationship, but by actively engaging with patients and resolving accounts with the least amount of hassle, healthcare organizations can go a long way in enhancing patient satisfaction, while improving their bottom line.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare organizations must take six critical steps to safeguard their revenue streams and ensure that patients remain accountable for their share of costs.", "author": "RevCycleIntelligence", "og": {"url": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/news/6-steps-for-safeguarding-the-healthcare-revenue-stream", "site_name": "RevCycleIntelligence", "image": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_2_8456952717.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "6 Steps for Safeguarding the Healthcare Revenue Stream"}, "twitter": {"description": "Healthcare organizations must take six critical steps to safeguard their revenue streams and ensure that patients remain accountable for their share of costs.", "creator": "@RevCycleIntel", "image": {"src": "http://revcycleintelligence.com/images/site/articles/imageedit_2_8456952717.jpg"}, "title": "6 Steps for Safeguarding the Healthcare Revenue Stream", "site": "@RevCycleIntel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index, follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe39ec\"", "article_summary": "Some may borrow from loved ones or creditors to pay bills; others may neglect them entirely\u2014translating to losses for medical providers that refuse to update their business practices.\nHealthcare providers will need to address this growing issue head-on if they hope to stay profitable and stay in business.\nHowever, rising patient out-of-pocket expenses \u2013 expected to reach $420 billion in 2015 \u2013 are just beginning to show their effects.\nCPT and ICD-10 codes are difficult for patients to understand, and the usual and customary billed charges only cause confusion.\nCollect the patient's responsibility at the time of serviceOn average, claims processing, payments, billing, bad debt and other aspects of revenue cycle management cost the healthcare industry $315 billion annually\u2014with providers taking the brunt of these expenses."}
