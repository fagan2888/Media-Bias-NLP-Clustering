Unfortunately, as Folsom resident Jaclyn Caramazza found out, that particular home remedy is nothing but movie magic.\n\nAs reported by FOX 40, the Caramazza family was out enjoying the scenery of their local bike trail when son Vinny accidentally stepped on a baby rattlesnake. Before long, Vinny\u2019s leg swelled purple from the venom and the nine-month pregnant Jaclyn responded as best as she knew how. \"Mama bear instinct in me decided to suck the venom because that\u2019s what Bonanza does,\" Jaclyn told FOX 40. Suffice to say, taking advice from a 14 season-long TV western probably isn\u2019t the most medically sound approach, not least of which because someone sucking out the venom may very well end up poisoning themselves as well.\n\nAs it turns out, there are much safer and more practical ways to deal with a snakebite. \u201cUse your basic wound type stuff, soap and water, wash the area, keep it clean and call 911 immediately,\u201d Chris Stoots of California Fish and Wildlife told FOX 40. Other basic pointers to avoid getting bitten in the first place are to come prepared with proper footwear and avoiding any sort of confrontation with a spotted snake. \"Any type of boot or some type of leather, something good is going to protect your feet and ankle area, which is a common area for bites,\" Stoots said.\n\nLuckily, both mom and son are perfectly fine after their ordeal, with Vinny receiving proper medical care and antivenoms soon after the bite. More than anything else, it seems their story will serve as a good cautionary tale for anyone else who tries to be the next snakebite expert.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "california, mom, learns, hard, way, you, shouldnt, suck, venom, out, snakebite", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Cali mom shows exactly what not to do when faced with a snakebite.", "title": "What Not To Do With A Snakebite [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/california-mom-learns-hard-way-you-shouldnt-suck-venom-out-snakebite-337822", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/11/california-mom-learns-hard-way-you-shouldnt-suck-venom-out-snakebite.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cali mom shows exactly what not to do when faced with a snakebite.", "title": "What Not To Do With A Snakebite [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/california-mom-learns-hard-way-you-shouldnt-suck-venom-out-snakebite-337822", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/styles/pulse_featured_video/public/2015/06/11/california-mom-learns-hard-way-you-shouldnt-suck-venom-out-snakebite.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/06/11/california-mom-learns-hard-way-you-shouldnt-suck-venom-out-snakebite.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-06-11T19:23:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-11T19:23:21-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Cali mom shows exactly what not to do when faced with a snakebite."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ae1\"", "article_summary": "\"Mama bear instinct in me decided to suck the venom because that\u2019s what Bonanza does,\" Jaclyn told FOX 40.\nAs reported by FOX 40, the Caramazza family was out enjoying the scenery of their local bike trail when son Vinny accidentally stepped on a baby rattlesnake.\n\u201cUse your basic wound type stuff, soap and water, wash the area, keep it clean and call 911 immediately,\u201d Chris Stoots of California Fish and Wildlife told FOX 40.\nBefore long, Vinny\u2019s leg swelled purple from the venom and the nine-month pregnant Jaclyn responded as best as she knew how.\nLuckily, both mom and son are perfectly fine after their ordeal, with Vinny receiving proper medical care and antivenoms soon after the bite."}
