The next step, and likely fight, will be over how to implement the budget deal.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nDemocrats are warning that if Republicans decide to attach conservative policy provisions such as defunding Planned Parenthood, the Environmental Protection Agency, or Obamacare, they will reject the bill and shut down the government.\n\nBut some Republicans say they are not worried about having a confrontation with Democrats over attaching appropriations that are in line with conservatives principles. They say they\u2019re ready to fight.\n\n\u201cEngland didn\u2019t just hand the United States our freedom; it had to be fought for\u201d Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) told Breitbart News. \u201cThe \u2018big government\u2019 control freaks in Washington are not going to just give Americans \u200etheir freedom either.\u201d He added that, \u201cIt will require a dedicated fight and will, likewise, be worth the fight.\u201d\n\nRep. Jim Jordan told Breitbart News that this is Congress\u2019 time to show the American people whose side they\u2019re on.\n\n\u201cFighting for conservative policies in any appropriations bills will show that Republicans are finally starting to listen to ordinary Americans who feel that this town has forgotten them\u201d said Jordan.\n\n\u201cThe American people are sick and tired of Congress spending more each year on lobbyists\u2019 priorities, while kicking the can down the road on actual reforms\u201d Jordan added. \u201cWe need to articulate a conservative vision that shows we understand what\u2019s wrong in America and have a plan to solve those problems.\u201d\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has warned Republicans that a bill with conservative policy provisions, which he calls \u201cpoison pill riders,\u201d will not be passed by Democrats and will lead to a government shutdown.\n\n\u201cNow, the path forward to avoid a shutdown is very simple,\u201d warned Schumer on Tuesday after a Senate Democrat Policy luncheon. \u201cWe don\u2019t have time to do individual bills, we should pass an omnibus bill that steers clear of poison pill riders.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo rather than playing with fire and attempting to insert poison pill riders that will bog down individual appropriations bills, Republicans should move quickly to complete negotiations on an omnibus bill that skips the riders and fully funds our national and economic security.\u201d\n\nThe situation will be a test for Paul Ryan (R-WI) who just replaced John Boehner as Speaker of the House. Ryan can either risk a fight with Democrats and put together a spending bill that satisfies the various conservative factions, or play nice with Democrats and risk a fight with Republicans.\n\nRyan has so far said that he is open to the idea of attaching a policy provision that strips funding for Planned Parenthood, something that Democrats have repeatedly warned against.\n\nFormer House Speaker John Boehner refused to fight for defunding Planned Parenthood, so many Republicans will be looking to see whether Ryan is willing to fight for a cause important to many conservatives.\n\nAlthough Ryan says he\u2019s open to putting up a fight for conservative principles, he appears to be lowering expectations.\n\n\u201cI think we need to be very clear about what it is we can and cannot achieve and not set expectations that we know we can\u2019t reach, given the constraints of the Constitution,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union.\n\nThe bill will need President Obama\u2019s signature by December 11, 2015 in order to avoid a government shutdown.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republicans in Congress say they won't back down from a fight over the budget and will make sure conservative policies are put in place.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Republicans in Congress say they won't back down from a fight over the budget and will make sure conservative policies are put in place.", "title": "Republicans Prepared for Government Shutdown Fight", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/AP_259166463441.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/11/12/exclusive-republicans-in-congress-prepared-for-possible-government-shutdown-fight/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Republicans in Congress say they won't back down from a fight over the budget and will make sure conservative policies are put in place.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/AP_259166463441.jpg", "title": "Republicans Prepared for Government Shutdown Fight", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "budget, John Boehner, Paul Ryan,Big Government, Economics,shutdown", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Big Government", "tag": "Paul Ryan", "published_time": "2015-11-12T11:20:45-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,Economics"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Ryan can either risk a fight with Democrats and put together a spending bill that satisfies the various conservative factions, or play nice with Democrats and risk a fight with Republicans.\nFormer House Speaker John Boehner refused to fight for defunding Planned Parenthood, so many Republicans will be looking to see whether Ryan is willing to fight for a cause important to many conservatives.\nAlthough Ryan says he\u2019s open to putting up a fight for conservative principles, he appears to be lowering expectations.\n\u201cNow, the path forward to avoid a shutdown is very simple,\u201d warned Schumer on Tuesday after a Senate Democrat Policy luncheon.\nThe bill will need President Obama\u2019s signature by December 11, 2015 in order to avoid a government shutdown."}
