PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Pittsburgh Catholic Diocese Bishop David Zubik is taking the United States government to court on Wednesday.

Bishop Zubik is challenging part of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.

“Very clearly this is a case about religious freedom,” Bishop Zubik said.

Bishop Zubik is the lead plaintiff, joined by other challengers, including Catholic charities, various Catholic colleges and other religious groups, going to the Supreme Court.

They say the government has no right to force those groups to be involved in providing contraception to women covered under their health plans.

Churches themselves are exempt.

“But once you come outside the church and take a look at the Little Sisters of the Poor for example, or Catholic charities, that’s where the fines would be attached,” he said.

The faith-based nonprofits are asking that the government find a way that does not involve them, or their insurers in providing birth control to women covered by their health plans.

Only arguments will be heard Wednesday. A ruling is not expected for a couple of months.

On Wednesday, Bishop Zubik joined the “KDKA Morning News” with Larry and John from Washington, D.C. shortly before he was to appear in front of the Supreme Court.

He said he is not taking issue with all of Obamacare and the idea that as an employer, the church needs to provide healthcare to their employees.

“The Catholic Church has long been supportive of healthcare for everybody and I think by and large we were very supportive of the Affordable Health Care Act. It was this particular mandate that goes against our principles,” said Zubik
