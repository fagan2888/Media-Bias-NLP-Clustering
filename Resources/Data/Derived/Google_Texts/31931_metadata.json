Low inpatient occupancy has been linked to hospital closures, with the 25 acute-care hospitals nationwide that closed in 2013 having an average inpatient occupancy of 34 percent, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission reported.\n\nBut Mercy Iowa City\u2019s profit margin remains strong, with a median 7.3 percent for the last five years \u2014 higher than the 6 percent median for UIHC, according to data reported to the Iowa Department of Public Health. At a time when UIHC and hospitals in Cedar Rapids are in a building frenzy, Mercy Iowa City has made small-scale investments in emerging specialty services that have paid off for the Catholic hospital.\n\nSince Mercy Iowa City doesn\u2019t focus on research or education of medical students, service is the top priority, Reed said.\n\nThe hospital had higher patient satisfaction scores in every category than UIHC, Mercy Medical Center in Cedar Rapids and UnityPoint Health-St. Luke\u2019s in Cedar Rapids, according to Medicare.gov\u2019s Hospital Compare.\n\n\u201cMercy is always going to be my institution of choice,\u201d said John Rutherford, of Iowa City, whose wife, Kris Kluseman, was recovering from a blood infection at Mercy Iowa City last week.\n\n\u201cSaturday morning, we called 911,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cThey wanted to know where we wanted to go. I said, \u2018Please, let it be Mercy.\u2019\u201d\n\nFriends across the river\n\nRutherford\u2019s and Kluseman\u2019s children, Aaron and Claire, were born at Mercy Iowa City and grew up going to doctors at Pediatric Associates, Rutherford said. When he learned in April 2014 the UI bought the pediatric clinic for $4.1 million, he was surprised and disappointed.\n\n\u201cWe decided not to follow them to the University of Iowa,\u201d he said.\n\nPediatric Associates, founded by Mercy Iowa City doctors in 1974, moved to UIHC because doctors wanted to be able to admit patients to the UI Children\u2019s Hospital, according to Dr. Stanley Hackbarth, quoted in the Daily Iowan on April 29, 2014. Before that, Pediatric Associates patients who needed hospital care could go only to Mercy Iowa City, the UIHC reported.\n\n\u201cIt was our intent to maintain existing relationships with hospital and physician groups within the Iowa City and Coralville area,\u201d Hackbarth wrote in a UI ad about the move. \u201cHowever, our request to continue privileges was denied by Mercy Iowa City.\u201d\n\nMercy Iowa City hired six new pediatricians to replace the lost clinic, Reed said.\n\nTen months later, the UIHC bought the Iowa City Heart Center for $1.17 million, which meant Mercy Iowa City had to hire four new cardiologists, Reed noted. He won\u2019t say how much the hires cost, but the \u201cacceleration of a physician employment strategy and additional debt related to this strategy\u201d was cited as a reason Moody\u2019s Investors Service downgraded Mercy Iowa City\u2019s bond rating in November.\n\n\u201cThe hospital is challenged by a competitive service area with a sizable academic medical center that is also seeking to integrate more closely with physicians,\u201d Moody\u2019s wrote.\n\nJust as Moody\u2019s doesn\u2019t name the UIHC, Reed rarely refers to the 715-bed academic medical center by name, instead calling it \u201ca very large teaching and research organization\u201d and \u201cour friends across the river\u201d. He says Mercy Iowa City doesn\u2019t compete with UIHC, but collaboration between the hospitals is limited.\n\nNiche markets\n\nMercy Iowa City isn\u2019t afraid to tout advantages.\n\nThe website for the Mercy Wound and Vein Center, opened in 2010, says it\u2019s the \u201conly facility of its kind in Johnson County\u201d for outpatient treatment of chronic and non-healing wounds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very big niche,\u201d said Dr. Mark Gomez, who treats wounds that include diabetic ulcers and bone infections.\n\nAmong treatment options is hyperbaric oxygen therapy, in which patients undergo a 20-day to 40-day course of 90-minute sessions inside a chamber pressurized with 100 percent oxygen. The pressure helps reduce swelling and discomfort while providing the body with 10 times the normal supply of oxygen to heal damaged tissue, according to the website.\n\nThe investment for the two chambers was about $300,000, Program Manager Judy Bennett said.\n\nMercy Iowa City also introduced a new bariatric surgery program earlier this year for people who are obese and have medical conditions, such as diabetes or hypertension.\n\n\u201cBariatric is one area contributing to increased revenue,\u201d Reed said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done something like 36 cases in the past year.\u201d\n\nChange, consolidation\n\nThe past five years have been turbulent for American hospitals struggling to adapt to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\nMercy Iowa City is considering joining the Mercy Health Network, which owns hospitals in Des Moines, Dubuque, Clinton, Mason City and Sioux City, Reed said.\n\n\u201cIn Iowa, you have UnityPoint and the Mercy Health Network. We\u2019re currently outside of both of those networks,\u201d he said. \u201cAll hospitals will be evaluating this over time.\u201d\n\nSo far, most patients who want to visit Mercy Iowa City haven\u2019t been prohibited by their insurance \u2014 but that could change if large insurers sign contracts with hospital networks that limit choices, Reed said.\n\nMercy Iowa City hasn\u2019t signed a contract with any of the four out-of-state managed care companies chosen to manage Iowa\u2019s 560,000 Medicaid managed-care recipients starting March 1. Reed said he first wants to know more about what the companies would provide.\n\nMercy Iowa City\u2019s low inpatient occupancy is a challenge because the hospital gets half its revenue from inpatients, Reed said. While all hospitals are seeing a shift to outpatient care, the national average hospital bed occupancy in 2013 was 60 percent \u2014 nearly double Mercy Iowa City \u2019s, reported the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent Congressional agency.\n\nBut Mercy Iowa City has taken the opportunity to convert two-person rooms to singles and uses some inpatient beds for observation of patients who have had outpatient procedures. Without costly building projects, Mercy Iowa City has capacity for more patients as the population of Johnson County grows and more patients are covered by the ACA, Reed said.\n\n\u201cOur hope is we can continue to provide choice in the community.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The Gazette | IOWA CITY - Mercy Iowa City, a private hospital started by nuns in 1873, has managed to stand alone without joining a hospital network and, in its own way, comp", "og": {"site_name": "The Gazette", "description": "IOWA CITY - Mercy Iowa City, a private hospital started by nuns in 1873, has managed to stand alone without joining a hospital network and, in its own way, compete with the crosstown goliath, the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.", "url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/health/mercy-iowa-city-proud-of-service-independence-20151227", "image": "http://www.thegazette.com/storyimage/GA/20151227/ARTICLE/151229779/EP/1/9/EP-151229779.jpg", "article": {"section": "Default"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thegazette.com/subject/news/health/mercy-iowa-city-proud-of-service-independence-20151227", "title": "Mercy Iowa City proud of service, independence", "description": "IOWA CITY - Mercy Iowa City, a private hospital started by nuns in 1873, has managed to stand alone without joining a hospital network and, in its own way, compete with the crosstown goliath, the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.", "site": "@gazettedotcom"}, "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "bt": {"title": "Mercy Iowa City proud of service, independence", "type": "thegazette_default", "pubDate": "2015-12-27T09:00:00-05:00", "modDate": "2015-12-26T20:06:00-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 163646090334606}, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cMercy is always going to be my institution of choice,\u201d said John Rutherford, of Iowa City, whose wife, Kris Kluseman, was recovering from a blood infection at Mercy Iowa City last week.\nMercy Iowa City is considering joining the Mercy Health Network, which owns hospitals in Des Moines, Dubuque, Clinton, Mason City and Sioux City, Reed said.\nIOWA CITY \u2014 Mercy Iowa City, a private hospital started by nuns in 1873, has managed to stand alone without joining a hospital network and, in its own way, compete with the crosstown goliath, the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.\nTen months later, the UIHC bought the Iowa City Heart Center for $1.17 million, which meant Mercy Iowa City had to hire four new cardiologists, Reed noted.\nSince Mercy Iowa City doesn\u2019t focus on research or education of medical students, service is the top priority, Reed said."}
