TV: ESPN\n\nOnly this time, quarterback Deshaun Watson was never knocked out of the game (though he did briefly require medical attention). And this time, that explosive offense did find its stride.\n\nBut credit No. 12 Clemson\u2019s defense, which made three interceptions in the first half, for lifting the Tigers to a 41-10 victory over visiting Appalachian State.\n\nThe Tigers\u2019 offense sputtered early with penalties, punts and a Watson interception on his second attempt, and led 3-0 after one quarter. Clemson\u2019s defense, however, continued to looked eerily similar to the 2014 version that ranked No. 1 in the nation in total defense.\n\n\u201cNo dropoff,\u201d defensive end Shaq Lawson said. \u201cWe feel like we\u2019ve got better players than we did last year.\u201d\n\nBetter than last year\u2019s squad that over the summer had 11 players on NFL rosters?\n\n\u201cI mean, we were part of that crew too,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cAll our players are different styles, and bring something different to the table.\u201d\n\nTen games remain for the Tigers (2-0), so comparisons can wait, but the mood in Clemson\u2019s locker room might have been different if not for Jayron Kearse snuffing an Appalachian State drive with an interception in the end zone, followed by Carlos Watkins and Ben Boulware picking off App State passes deep in Mountaineers territory.\n\nWatkins, a defensive tackle, dropped back in zone coverage and picked off quarterback Taylor Lamb\u2019s pass, trotting 15 yards for a touchdown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really every big guy\u2019s dream to get in the end zone,\u201d said Watkins. \u201cThat\u2019s probably something I\u2019ll remember forever.\u201d\n\nTwo plays later, Boulware snared a Lamb pass, setting up a short field for the first of two touchdown receptions by fifth-year senior receiver Charone Peake. Very quickly, Clemson turned a three-point lead into a 21-0 cushion with 14 points off turnovers in a two-minute span.\n\n\u201cI thought our defense played well early and really gave us a chance,\u201d App State coach Scott Satterfield said. \u201cBut giving them a free seven points on the pick-six really put us in a bind. You can\u2019t do that against a good football team.\u201d\n\nClemson outgained Appalachian State, 280-88, in the first half on its way to a 31-0 halftime lead.\n\n\u201cDefensively dominant,\u201d Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said. \u201cReally, really good, that first group.\u201d\n\nPeake, who has been on the shelf or a forgotten asset for most his college career, answered the bell with the first multi-touchdown game of his career.\n\n\u201cIt was not a surprise for the coaches because we\u2019ve seen it through spring and fall camp,\u201d offensive coordinator Jeff Scott said. \u201cIt was really a matter of Charone getting those opportunities, and capitalizing on them.\u201d\n\nRunning back Wayne Gallman added a 23-yard touchdown, bulldozing Mountaineers safety Alex Gray over the goal line.\n\nThe exclamation point on Clemson\u2019s second-quarter outburst was Peake\u2019s second touchdown of the afternoon. With the ball on the Tigers\u2019 own 41, Watson dropped back and launched a pass that Peake caught and ran in for a 59-yard touchdown.\n\n\u201cI just looked up, and I didn\u2019t even think he could throw it that far,\u201d Peake said.\n\nAs Peake pulled it in, Watson pumped his fists, twirled to face the student section and saluted.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Clemson overcomes rocky start to beat App State, 41-10, Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nrsssports, Appalachian State-Clemson,Carlos Watkins,Charone Peake,Clemson football,Deshaun Watson", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "CLEMSON \u2014 There was a slight twinge of deja vu, kind of like those days a year ago when Clemson\u2019s offense couldn\u2019t get out of its own way, and the defense, sick and tired of earning more criticism than praise, took the game into", "title": "Clemson overcomes rocky start to beat App State, 41-10", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150912/150919740/clemson-overcomes-rocky-start-to-beat-app-state-41-10", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150912/PC20/150919740/AR/0/AR-150919740.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150912/PC20/150919740/AR/0/AR-150919740.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CLEMSON \u2014 There was a slight twinge of deja vu, kind of like those days a year ago when Clemson\u2019s offense couldn\u2019t get out of its own way, and the defense, sick and tired of earning more criticism than praise, took the game into", "title": "Clemson overcomes rocky start to beat App State, 41-10", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150912/PC20/150919740/AR/0/AR-150919740.jpg?201509121932", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150919740}}, "keywords": "Clemson overcomes rocky start to beat App State, 41-10 , Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nrsssports, \r\nrsssports, Appalachian State-Clemson,Carlos Watkins,Charone Peake,Clemson football,Deshaun Watson", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-12T15:59:31Z", "modified_time": "2015-09-12T19:32:00Z", "author": "Aaron Brenner"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "CLEMSON \u2014 There was a slight twinge of deja vu, kind of like those days a year ago when Clemson\u2019s offense couldn\u2019t get out of its own way, and the defense, sick and tired of earning more criticism than praise, took the game into"}, "article_summary": "Clemson defensive tackle Carlos Watkins (94) returned an interception for a touchdown in the Tigers\u2019 41-10 victory over Appalachian State.\n12 Clemson\u2019s defense, which made three interceptions in the first half, for lifting the Tigers to a 41-10 victory over visiting Appalachian State.\nClemson\u2019s defense, however, continued to looked eerily similar to the 2014 version that ranked No.\n\u201cI thought our defense played well early and really gave us a chance,\u201d App State coach Scott Satterfield said.\n\u201cReally, really good, that first group.\u201dPeake, who has been on the shelf or a forgotten asset for most his college career, answered the bell with the first multi-touchdown game of his career."}
