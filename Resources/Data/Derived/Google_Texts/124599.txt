Several states are mulling the possibility of merging their healthcare exchanges under the federal program, according to a report from The Hill. There are currently 13 state-run exchanges, and state leaders are citing budgetary concerns, as federal subsidies are set to run out next year.

“What is happening is states are figuring out the money is running out,” Jim Wadleigh, who runs the state exchange in Connecticut told The Hill. “At the end of 2016, everyone has to be self-sustaining.”

In lieu of a full merger, some are said to be considering multi-state exchanges. The so-called “shared marketplace” option is drawn from an obscure clause in the Affordable Care Act.

If state exchanges are not financially self-sufficient by 2016, they will be forced to join the federal system, accessible via HealthCare.gov.

Others believe a case currently before the U.S. Supreme Court, King v. Burwell, is driving merger talks. The court is expected to decide whether federal subsidies to help low-income families afford insurance are legal in states that opted not to create their own exchanges.

“If the court rules against the Obama administration, millions of people in states across the country will lose subsidies,” Sara Ferris wrote for The Hill.
