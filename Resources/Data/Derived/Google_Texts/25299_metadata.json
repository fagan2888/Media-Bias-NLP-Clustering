Hundreds of people are expected by organizers at a rally this weekend, some hoping it\u2019ll be the largest rally in the tri-city area\u2019s history, in part because thirty seconds of the incident, showing cops trying to use a stun gun and then shooting Zambrano, were caught on video:\n\nA \u201cspecial unit\u201d of various local police are investigating the shooting, while Pasco police say cops fired because they felt threatened by Zambrano. The police chief, Bob Metzger, spoke with organizers at a local caf\u00e9, telling them police would give them anything they need. \u201cAt the end of the day, we want to be safe,\u201d he told them. \u201cWe all want to make sure we got home safely to our families. That\u2019s really what I am here to help you with.\u201d Court records show Zambrano had been previously arrested for allegedly throwing objects at officers and allegedly trying to grab an officer\u2019s gun, but wasn\u2019t convicted, and police aren\u2019t saying cops were aware of that.\n\nThe county coroner says he is considering whether to request an inquest into the homicide\u2014he\u2019s only done so twice in the last twenty years but says it\u2019s an \u201copen and transparent\u201d process. He may wait until the police investigation is over.\n\nOne of the three cops involved in the shooting, Ryan Flannigan, was previously the target of a federal civil rights lawsuit over excessive use of force, where he was accused of brutalizing a 30-year-old mother on her way to pick up her children because she was a Hispanic woman like the teenager police say they were looking for. She says she suffered second degree burns from Flannigan and another cop pressing her face into the hood of their car after she asked for an interpreter. She was briefly charged with \u201chindering\u201d the investigation but those charges were dismissed. The city settled for $100,000 and Flannigan kept his job.\n\nZambrano is the fourth man shot by police in Pasco, a city of 68,000, in the last six months. The previous three shootings, each described by police as a confrontation involving an armed suspect, were all ruled justified\u2014one of the men was killed by a SWAT team during a four-hour stand-off after firing more than 70 rounds at police, another after allegedly leading cops on a chase in a stolen car and pointing a pellet gun at them.\n\nThe third, Brad Jensen, was shot while refusing to drop a knife after police responded to a call about a man brandishing a knife. He was the son of a former city detective and councilman. If the shooting of Zambrano is ruled justified, it\u2019s likely to be described as a confrontation with an armed man as well.\n\nRelated: Police registries and other policies to help cops chill out.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Thirty seconds of the incident were caught on video, helping to spur protests expected to be some of the area's largest.", "title": "Police Shoot Rock-Throwing Man, Could Lead to Largest Protest in Washington State Tri-City Area", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/02/13/police-shoot-rock-throwing-man-could-lea", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14238508054616.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thirty seconds of the incident were caught on video, helping to spur protests expected to be some of the area's largest.", "title": "Police Shoot Rock-Throwing Man, Could Lead to Largest Protest in Washington State Tri-City Area", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14238508054616.jpg", "creator": "@edkrayewski", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Washington", "published_time": "2015-02-13T18:09:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ed-krayewski"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd704d\"", "article_summary": "Zambrano is the fourth man shot by police in Pasco, a city of 68,000, in the last six months.\nIf the shooting of Zambrano is ruled justified, it\u2019s likely to be described as a confrontation with an armed man as well.\nThe police chief, Bob Metzger, spoke with organizers at a local caf\u00e9, telling them police would give them anything they need.\nPolice in Pasco, Wash., shot and killed Antonio Zambrano-Montes, a 35-year-old orchard worker, after he allegedly threw rocks at police and then tried to run away.\nThe third, Brad Jensen, was shot while refusing to drop a knife after police responded to a call about a man brandishing a knife."}
