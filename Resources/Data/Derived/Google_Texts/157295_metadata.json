This is yet another piece of the puzzle that explains why our media is so out of touch and why our pundits have been so wrong about everything for so long.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWhile our media overlords in Washington DC and Manhattan relentlessly push to further-empower government by presenting government as the solution to every problem, 58% of the American people see government as their worst fear.\n\nThis can\u2019t be good news for Hillary Clinton.\n\nHow out of touch is our media? More people fear gun control (36.5%) and ObamaCare (35.7%) than they do illness (34.4%), a nuclear attack (33.6%) or \u2014 get this \u2014 Global Warming (30.7%).\n\nPeople are more afraid of government bureaucrats, gun control, and ObamaCare than they are of unemployment (23.8%).\n\nHere\u2019s the real kicker. Despite the media\u2019s attempt to paint their Global Warming hoax as an imminent catastrophe and illegal immigration as the bringer of candy-colored rainbows and chocolate rivers, people are almost as afraid of illegal immigration (29.7%) as they are of Global Warming (30.7%).\n\nMoreover, despite a two-year propaganda campaign based almost exclusively on lies, only 12.2% named Hate Crimes.\n\nDespite what the media tells you, losing faith in government is actually very healthy for our society. It breeds self-reliance, and there is nothing better for the human spirit than self-reliance.\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC", "article_metadata": {"description": "Media Fail: Americans #1 Fear is Government Corruption", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Media Fail: Americans #1 Fear is Government Corruption", "title": "Media Fail: Americans #1 Fear is Government Corruption - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/GettyImages-492553438.jpg", "height": 479}, "updated_time": "2015-10-15T07:24:42-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/15/media-fail-americans-1-fear-is-government-corruption/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Media Fail: Americans #1 Fear is Government Corruption", "creator": "@noltenc", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/GettyImages-492553438.jpg", "title": "Media Fail: Americans #1 Fear is Government Corruption - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "2016 Poll, Government Corruption, Media Bias,Big Government, Big Hollywood,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-10-15T07:15:26-07:00", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-10-15T07:24:42-07:00", "tag": "Media Bias", "categories": "Big Government,Big Hollywood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "More people fear gun control (36.5%) and ObamaCare (35.7%) than they do illness (34.4%), a nuclear attack (33.6%) or \u2014 get this \u2014 Global Warming (30.7%).\nDespite what the media tells you, losing faith in government is actually very healthy for our society.\nDespite the media\u2019s attempt to paint their Global Warming hoax as an imminent catastrophe and illegal immigration as the bringer of candy-colored rainbows and chocolate rivers, people are almost as afraid of illegal immigration (29.7%) as they are of Global Warming (30.7%).\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIn a Chapman University poll of 1541 adult Americans about their fears and anxieties, number one by a country mile, with 58%, was the fear of corrupt government officials.\nHow out of touch is our media?"}
