Syracuse, N.Y. -- The open enrollment period for Obamacare began Saturday and runs through Feb. 15. I am answering readers' questions about enrolling for the first time or renewing their coverage.

Here we go:

I have been enrolled since last year. Do I have to do anything or will my coverage automatically renew/roll over? -- Venetia Kanellos

If you enrolled last year and you don't do anything, your existing coverage will be automatically renewed unless your plan has been discontinued. If you are receiving subsidies to reduce premium costs you will get the same same subsidies if you are automatically re-enrolled. Experts, however, advise against automatic re-enrollment. That's because the plan you have now may change in 2015. Premiums and other costs associated with your plan could increase. Some of the doctors and other providers participating in your plan now may not do so next year. Benefits provided by your plan could also change. Any changes like those should be outlined in notices consumers are getting from insurers. That's why consumers are being advised to review their coverage and shop around. You may be able to get a better deal. You can do this on your own online on the New York health insurance exchange or seek help from a navigator or broker. The exchange has an online directory of navigators and brokers who can help you. If you switch plans you must do so by Dec. 15 to have coverage effective Jan. 1.
