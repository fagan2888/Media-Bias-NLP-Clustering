Less than 25 percent of women say that they always orgasm during sex, and there are still only a few resources for women trying to achieve that oh-so-invigorating moment. Delving deeper into possible biological causes to the problem, a recent study finds that women who had difficulty reaching orgasm also tended to have smaller clitorises, which were also located further from the vagina.\n\nAlthough most people should be familiar with the clitoris\u2019 extra-sensitive external part, called the glans, few know that it extends beneath the skin, into a wishbone-like shape. Beyond the glans, there\u2019s the body, which curves downward toward the vaginal opening. From where it curves, it splits into a wishbone-like structure called the crura (plural for crus), which extends outwards, and is mostly associated with urethral and perineal tissue, and nerves and ligaments. Also connected to the clitoris, in-between the crura, are two bulbs \u2014 essentially spongy erectile tissue that becomes engorged when stimulated \u2014 that \u201chug\u201d the vaginal opening, according to the Museum of Sex.\n\nResearchers of the current study found that women who were diagnosed with anorgasmia, an inability to orgasm even after stimulation, had a larger distance between their clitoral glans and body, and the vaginal opening. In all, the distance was about five to six centimeters longer \u2014 on average, the crura and body can be up to 10 centimeters \u2014 and these women also tended to have smaller clitorises. \u201cPerhaps a larger clitoris has more nerve endings, and perhaps with direct contact and stimulation, the clitoris can have more sensation, resulting in orgasms,\u201d Dr. Susan Oakley, a co-author of the study and OBGYN at Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, told LiveScience.\n\nIs There A Way To Achieve Orgasm?\n\nOakley and her colleagues discovered this through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of 30 women, consisting of 10 with anorgasmia and 20 who could achieve orgasm. Besides looking at the distance, they also had the women fill out questionnaires, which asked about their sex life, body image, and their levels of desire and arousal. Although problems with orgasm may come from a woman\u2019s unique anatomy, other factors could also play a part, Oakley said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of subjectivity involving female pleasure. Some of it is psychosocial, some of it is anatomy and function,\u201d she told LiveScience. \u201cWe were trying to focus on anatomy.\u201d\n\nAlthough the team couldn\u2019t find an association between women\u2019s perceived body image and confidence, they were able to find a correlation with reported pleasure and sexual positions. Women who weren\u2019t able to achieve orgasm also preferred missionary position. Conversely, women who achieved orgasm preferred being on top of their partner, allowing for more clitoral stimulation. \u201cMaybe women without orgasms have a small clitoris, but if they were to try female dominant positions, maybe they could get closer stimulation to the clitoris and overcome the fact that it is small,\u201d Oakley told LiveScience.\n\nOakley also said that it\u2019s still unclear whether it\u2019s a woman\u2019s anatomy that influences orgasm or orgasms that change anatomy. Regardless, there are things a woman can do to try to improve sexual pleasure and function. One such thing is orgasmic meditation, which involves creating a deeper spiritual connection between man and woman through long-lasting stimulation \u2014 essentially slow sex (see video here).\n\nAnother technique women can try is pelvic floor training, which are also called kegels. This kind of training is easy, only requiring a woman (or man, even) to contract the muscles they would normally use to hold their urine. The National Institutes of Health says that the easiest way to see if you\u2019re doing it right is to try to stop urinating mid-flow. These muscles, which control the vagina, bladder, and anus, will tighten if done correctly. Tighten them and count to 10, then relax until 10 again \u2014 do this three to five times a day. \u201cThe orgasm is an intense contraction, and a stronger pelvic floor can definitely intensify that, and even make it easier to have G-spot orgasms,\u201d sex therapist Dr. Laura Berman told The Huffington Post. \u201cThis is because you are creating greater tension around the G-spot and around him (the man\u2019s penis).\u201d\n\nSource: Oakley S, Vaccaro C, Crisp C, et al.
