Luckily, I have supportive bosses and maintain a strict schedule. No one will make me leave but me.\u201d\n\nThe event at the liberal think tank was used to advocate \u201cpaid family leave, paid sick days and flexibility arrangements\u201d for men. Earnest used the opportunity to promote President Obama\u2019s budget, released earlier this week.\n\n\u201cSocietal pressure and understanding bosses help,\u201d he said, \u201cbut in the president\u2019s budget, there is more money for paid leave when a child gets sick and an increase in childcare. While I am lucky, many workers don\u2019t have these types of influences in their workplace. That is the major role for policy.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s proposal for paid sick leave sparked debate about the unintended consequences it may cause.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation\u2019s James Sherk, a senior policy analyst in labor economics, last month noted that 91 percent of businesses already provide some form of sick leave.\n\n\u201cThe popularity of Obama\u2019s paid sick leave proposal depends on workers not realizing it ultimately comes out of their paychecks,\u201d Sherk wrote for The Daily Signal. \u201cIf the president\u2019s proposal becomes law, many workers will lose the equivalent of seven days of pay a year.\u201d\n\nFollowing Earnest\u2019s remarks, panelists debated the role of families in the workforce.\n\n\u201cThe ideals of being a good father are changing,\u201d said Erin Rehel, consultant at Advisory Board Co. \u201cMore men are involved in childcare and domestic labor. Stay-at-home dads are also on the rise and studies show an increase in worker-family conflict for men.\u201d\n\nLoren Harris, director of family economic security at the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, said, \u201cIn the fight for gender equality, we often miss men.\u201d\n\nWhile the panelists acknowledged the culture within workplaces has shifted, they also argued for more government intervention.\n\n\u201cWhen you make paid leave available to fathers, you get more applicants,\u201d Rehel argued. \u201cIt makes men more active parents.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "How does Josh Earnest balance being the White House press secretary and a father?", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "How does Josh Earnest balance being the White House press secretary and a father?", "title": "Josh Earnest Opens Up About Fatherhood in Pitch for Obama's Paid Leave Proposal", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/5875545254_58a06793cf_o.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-06T13:28:49+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1DNn07L"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "How does Josh Earnest balance being the White House press secretary and a father?", "title": "Josh Earnest Opens Up About Fatherhood in Pitch for Obama's Paid Leave Proposal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/5875545254_58a06793cf_o.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Economy", "tag": "labor", "published_time": "2015-02-07T03:01:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-06T13:28:49+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "paid leave, family, father, workers, Josh Earnest, Barack Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe01dc\"", "article_summary": "That is the major role for policy.\u201dObama\u2019s proposal for paid sick leave sparked debate about the unintended consequences it may cause.\n\u201cThe popularity of Obama\u2019s paid sick leave proposal depends on workers not realizing it ultimately comes out of their paychecks,\u201d Sherk wrote for The Daily Signal.\n\u201cWhen you make paid leave available to fathers, you get more applicants,\u201d Rehel argued.\nNo one will make me leave but me.\u201dThe event at the liberal think tank was used to advocate \u201cpaid family leave, paid sick days and flexibility arrangements\u201d for men.\nEarnest used the opportunity to promote President Obama\u2019s budget, released earlier this week."}
