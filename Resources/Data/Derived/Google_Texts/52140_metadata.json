Darrell Issa, R-Calif., told reporters in the Capitol Friday morning.\n\nOther names that have been floated include Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, another member well respected among conservatives and moderates alike; John Cline, R-Minn., the chairman of the House Education Committee; Tom Cole, R-Okla., the deputy whip and a Boehner ally; and Issa.\n\nBut some members of Congress and analysts warn that the next House speaker \u2014 whether Ryan or someone else \u2014 has little chance of taming a conference bent on being this unruly, with the repercussions likely to be felt soon by the American public.\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s historic majority in the House, they said, has proved not only ungovernable but also incapable of governing the country. The agenda of the party is now largely driven by the party\u2019s right flank \u2014 40 or so members of the House Freedom Caucus, who have insisted that their legislative leaders shun all compromise and take the country to the brink if necessary to forward their policy agenda.\n\n\u201cSometimes you need to hit rock bottom,\u201d McCarthy told The National Review on Thursday about what it would take to proceed.\n\nThose urging Ryan to consider a bid say that he, unlike McCarthy, would have the 218 votes in the full House of Representatives necessary to take the gavel. But it\u2019s unclear if Ryan will have political capital beyond that to get members to step into line.\n\n\u201c[Ryan] could help bring people together, but at the end of the day, it\u2019s not who we put in the job but how we change the underlying political dynamic that got us in this situation,\u201d Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, told reporters on Friday morning, coming out a closed-door strategy session for House GOP members. \u201cHow do we move bills? How do we get functionality \u2014 doing the most basic things that we\u2019re supposed to do?\u201d\n\nThe take-no-prisoners tactics of the hard-line members in 2013 led to a three-week government shutdown over funding for the Affordable Care Act and a near breach of the nation\u2019s debt ceiling when GOP lawmakers refused to raise the nation\u2019s spending cap over fiscal concerns. Many of the same members urged Boehner to shut down the government over federal funding for Planned Parenthood, the embattled women\u2019s health organization and abortion provider, and threatened his ouster if he failed to toe the line.\n\nAlthough those issues have largely been resolved, other critical deadlines now loom for Congress. A temporary spending bill that is funding the federal government expires on Dec. 11. Legislation to fund the nation\u2019s transit system is urgently needed. Most significant, Nov. 5 is the deadline to once again raise the nation\u2019s spending cap, according to the Treasury Department, with disastrous consequences for the global economy if lawmakers can't come to an agreement.\n\n\u201cAt this point in time, the House is dominated by a group of conservatives that don\u2019t feel any need to engage in any of the basic necessities of governing,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former longtime aide to Senate Democrats. \u201cI don\u2019t think the Lord himself could be elected speaker right now. Someone on the far right would have complaints.\u201d\n\nThe irony, said John Hudak, a fellow in governance studies at the Washington-based Brookings Institution, said GOP House members, many of them hailing from deeply conservative districts, are unlikely to face electoral consequences for their insurgency.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of Americans in conservative districts who want their representatives to behave in exactly the way they\u2019re behaving,\u201d he said.\n\nThe GOP brand and other candidates competing in closer 2016 elections are a different story.\n\n\u201cIf Republican antics in the House wreak havoc on the American economy or have the prospect of wreaking havoc on the American economy, Republican senators seeking re-election are going to pay the price, and the Republican nominee for president is going to pay the price,\u201d Hudak said. \u201cThe House is causing the trouble, and everybody else has to deal with the consequences.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A tall order faces the next speaker of the House, with consequences looming for American public", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/10/9/can-the-house-gop-be-tamed.html", "image": {"width": 1460, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/10/9/can-the-house-gop-be-tamed/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.McCarthy-Ryan.1444421693701.jpg", "height": 911}, "type": "article", "description": "A tall order faces the next speaker of the House, with consequences looming for American public", "title": "Choosing a new House speaker is unlikely to calm GOP turmoil"}, "LastModifiedDate": "Fri, 09 Oct 2015 20:15:29 GMT", "twitter": {"image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2015/10/9/can-the-house-gop-be-tamed/jcr:content/headlineImage.adapt.1460.high.McCarthy-Ryan.1444421693701.jpg", "description": "Analysis: A tall order faces the next speaker of the House, with consequences looming for American public", "site": "@AJAM", "card": "summary", "title": "Choosing a new House speaker is unlikely to calm GOP turmoil"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Politics, Republican Party, Congress, U.S.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd8ab\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI don\u2019t think the Lord himself could be elected speaker right now.\nMost significant, Nov. 5 is the deadline to once again raise the nation\u2019s spending cap, according to the Treasury Department, with disastrous consequences for the global economy if lawmakers can't come to an agreement.\nThe Republican Party\u2019s historic majority in the House, they said, has proved not only ungovernable but also incapable of governing the country.\nBut it\u2019s unclear if Ryan will have political capital beyond that to get members to step into line.\n\u201cSometimes you need to hit rock bottom,\u201d McCarthy told The National Review on Thursday about what it would take to proceed."}
