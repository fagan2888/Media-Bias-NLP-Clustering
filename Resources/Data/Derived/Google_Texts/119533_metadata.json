Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented.\n\nMillions of people will be affected by the court's decision, including 132,253 in Alabama. The justices were trying to determine whether the law makes people in all 50 states eligible for federal tax subsidies to cut the cost of insurance premiums. Opponents said that only residents of states that set up their own insurance markets can get federal subsidies to help pay the premiums.\n\n\"It's a great day for healthcare in Alabama,\" said Jim Carnes, policy director of Arise Citizens' Policy Project.\n\nRoughly three dozen states did not set up their own exchanges and instead relied on the federal healthcare.gov. The Obama administration said it would make no sense to condition subsidies on where people live, and that doing so would set off a \"death spiral\" in which enrollment declines, driving premiums up and leaving only the sickest, and costliest, people insured.\n\nIn Alabama, 145,763 citizens obtained coverage through the Affordable Care Act this year, and about 90 percent of them received subsidies. Insurance premiums will increase by an average of 321 percent for those who lose subsidies after the decision. Alabama has one of the highest percentages of consumers receiving subsidies, and some of the lowest prices for insurance on the exchange.\n\nIf the court ruled against the subsidies, two-thirds of those who bought coverage using the tax credits were expected to drop the insurance, which would have created a \"death spiral\" for the law.\n\nSally Speaker of Jasper said her son was able to obtain coverage in the first year of the healthcare law for less than $100 a month with subsidies. Before the law went into effect, she and her husband paid more than $300 a month for his health insurance.\n\nHer son has an eye injury that requires regular treatment. Without access to healthcare, he could go blind in one eye, she said.\n\nHer 31-year-old son works in technical theater, a field that does not offer many full-time jobs with benefits, she said. He has moved from state-to-state looking for work, without considering whether he moved to one that set up its own exchange \u2013 where he would be eligible for tax credits.\n\n\"He may end up being a freelancer,\" Speaker said. \"I don't know if he'll end up working for someone who actually offers his benefits. He works in dome stadiums and he works on a catwalk \u2013 with one good eye. And it's high-stakes for us because we cannot insure him anymore.\"\n\nStill, critics of the law say it has pushed up insurance prices with costly coverage mandates. A report issued in June by the Heritage Foundation found that 463,000 people in Alabama would save money on insurance premiums if the law was overturned. The group expressed disappointment in today's ruling.\n\n\"The law continues to be unaffordable for everyday Americans,\" said Nina Owcharenko, director of Heritage's Center for Health Policy Studies. \"Obamacare's costly insurance regulations have made coverage more expensive. Even now, double-digit rate increases are being submitted for 2016.\"\n\nCarnes said his organization plans to keep working to enroll more Alabamians in marketplace coverage and work on expanding Medicaid.\n\n\"Now with this case settled, we can focus on closing the coverage gap,\" he said.\n\nUpdated at 9:34 a.m. with quotes from Jim Carnes of Arise.
