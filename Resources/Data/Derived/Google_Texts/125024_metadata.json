Williams explains how the penalties vary and how big they can get.\n\nPresident Barack Obama hugs Edna Pemberton, who introduced him, before speaking with volunteers who helped people enroll through the HealthCare.gov site at Temple Emanu-El in Dallas. Penalties for not signing up for health insurance vary but are likely higher than the assumed $95.\n\nStories about the Affordable Care Act often tell readers that they\u2019ll have to pay a $95 penalty if they don\u2019t get adequate health insurance coverage. But, like a lot of other things I read about the health law, that\u2019s not quite correct. The penalty (which the Supreme Court said is actually a tax) could be less or, more likely, a lot more. It\u2019s a complicated story.\n\nThe basic penalty is $95 in 2014\u2014if you\u2019re unmarried with no dependents and your income is less than $19,500. If your income is higher, you\u2019ll owe more: 1 percent of the amount by which your income exceeds the sum of a single person\u2019s personal exemption and standard deduction in the federal income tax. That\u2019s $10,000 in 2013. But be warned: Income equals adjusted gross income (AGI\u2014that number on the last line on page 1 of your tax return) plus any tax-exempt interest and excluded income earned abroad. If you make $30,000, your penalty will be $200.\n\nStill with me? Good, because it is about to get more confusing.\n\nRecommended: Obamacare 101: Seven ways you can sign up, despite Web woes\n\nIf you\u2019re married or have kids, you\u2019ll owe a minimum of $95 per person for yourself, your spouse, and each dependent over age 17 plus half that amount for each child under 18. But the total can\u2019t exceed three times the basic $95 tax, or $285. Except it can. If 1 percent of your income (minus your and your spouse\u2019s personal exemptions and standard deduction\u2014$20,000 in 2013\u2014plus those add-ons) is more than $285, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll owe. Oh, and you\u2019ll have to include your dependents\u2019 income in the calculation.\n\nBut there\u2019s a cap. Your total penalty can\u2019t exceed the national average premium for a bronze-level health policy for your family\u2019s size. We don\u2019t know what that is yet but it\u2019s surely more than $95. CBO projects that the average bronze premium in 2016 will be between $4,500 and $5,000 for an individual plan and more than $12,000 for families. If your income exceeds $1.2 million next year, that ceiling might apply.\n\nThat\u2019s just for 2014. The penalty will grow over time: The dollar minimums will be $325 in 2015 and $695 in 2016 and will grow with inflation after that (rounded down to multiples of $50). By 2023, it will hit a projected $800. And the percentage of income penalty also grows\u2014to 2 percent in 2015 and 2.5 percent after that.\n\nSome people won\u2019t have to pay the tax. Even if you don\u2019t have insurance, you\u2019re safe if you have religious objections to health insurance, are an American Indian, are in jail, or are \u201cnot lawfully present\u201d in the U.S., among other reasons. You\u2019re also protected if buying insurance would impose economic hardship. That happens if it would cost more than 8 percent of your income (defined slightly differently of course).\n\nIf you owe a penalty, you\u2019re supposed to pay it with your income tax return. But there\u2019s not much the IRS can do if you don\u2019t pay. They can\u2019t put you in jail or garnish your wages. In fact, about the only way the IRS can collect is if you\u2019re due a refund. They can deduct the penalty from this year\u2019s and future refunds.\n\nA well-known radio personality is urging people to avoid the penalty by making sure you won\u2019t get a tax refund. Ignore him. Trying this requires many years of careful planning and is easy to mess up. Besides, most Americans love their refunds.\n\nThere is, of course, a simpler way to avoid the penalty: Sign up for health insurance.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.content.id": "7e134f215faf2ab60071d40b6271f373", "sailthru.author": "Roberton Williams", "description": "The penalty for not getting adequate health insurance is likely higher than the assumed $95.
