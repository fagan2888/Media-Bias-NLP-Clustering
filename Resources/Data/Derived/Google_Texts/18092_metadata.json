California alone had 900,000 individual policies cancelled, adding to a national total of several million.\n\nDoug Holtz-Eakin, former head of the Congressional Budget Office, says \"if you look at the 7 million and you shave off the 20 percent who probably haven\u2019t paid, you've got about 5 and a half million people and that's roughly the number of people that were in the individual market and started having their policies cancelled.\"\n\nThat 20 percent number who don't pay has often been cited by insurance sources. Blue Cross/Blue Shield this week confirmed that up to 20 percent of those enrolled by February 1 still have not paid a premium.\n\nAs far as the potential cancellations, Carney referred to the 14 million as a \"sliver\" of the population, even though it's double the number of current signups.\n\n\u201cYou need to look at the 7 million in the context of the U.S. population, and that's about 330 million people,\" says Dan Mendelson of Avalere Health, a non-partisan consulting and analysis firm. \"So, this, this program is going to insure about two percent of the total folks who live in the United States.\"\n\nSo while the administration portrayed that two percent as victory, the five percent facing cancellations was minimized, leading Holtz-Eakin to observe that \" it can\u2019t be the case that, you know, five percent is no big deal and signing up two percent is a triumph, those two can\u2019t stand simultaneously.\"\n\nSome of those who were cancelled were forced into ObamCare, which added to the enrollment numbers, even though they only needed insurance because their policies had been cancelled, not because they were uninsured.\n\nJim Angle currently serves as chief national correspondent for Fox News Channel (FNC).
