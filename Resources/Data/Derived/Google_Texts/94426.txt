Arkansas State Capitol

LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (April 20, 2016) – Following this afternoon’s Senate vote on the appropriation to fund continuation of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion, Americans for Prosperity – Arkansas issued the following statement:

"We applaud the Senators who voted against funding the continuation of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion in Arkansas. This program adds billions to in new government spending, makes more Arkansans dependent on a federal entitlement program, and robs future taxpayers who will have to foot the bill for this unsustainable program."



AFP issued a key vote alert for SB121, the appropriation for DHS Medical Services, which funds Obamacare's Medicaid expansion. Since Governor Hutchinson has made clear his intent to line-item veto language ending the program, the end result of this appropriation will advance Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion. Americans for Prosperity will be scoring “Nay” and “Present” votes as a vote consistent with opposing/ending Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion and “Yea” votes as consistent with supporting Obamacare's Medicaid expansion.
