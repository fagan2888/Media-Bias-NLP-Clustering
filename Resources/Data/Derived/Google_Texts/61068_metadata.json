Everywhere you look, there are big red warning signs flashing urgently and signaling the coming collapse. In the last month and a half, his national polling numbers have crashed from a tied-for-first 25 percent to a fourth-place 10 percent. In Iowa, where he was positioned to dominate among the state\u2019s evangelical conservative voters, he\u2019s crashed from a field-leading 30 percent to, once again, fourth place. In New Hampshire he was once runner-up to Donald Trump; now he\u2019s languishing in the basement with Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul.\n\nThe broadly accepted reason for the Carson implosion has been his impossible-to-ignore unfamiliarity with the basics of national security and foreign policy, which sunk him in the aftermath of the Paris terrorist attacks and the San Bernardino shootings. And while that\u2019s undoubtedly true, his troubles were magnified by the fact that his campaign organization is a shambolic and chaos-ridden operation that does nothing for the candidate besides raise money.\n\nThis crippling disorder is very much Carson\u2019s fault, as he doesn\u2019t seem to understand how to manage or coordinate with his subordinates. Yesterday he gave an interview to the Washington Post and suggested that he was planning an overhaul of his campaign staff and strategy \u2013 the \u201cshake up\u201d that so many past struggling campaigns have slogged through in a last-ditch attempt to arrest the skid into oblivion. \u201cI\u2019m looking at every aspect of the campaign right now,\u201d he told the Post. \u201cEverything is on the table, every job is on the table. And we\u2019re going to analyze it very carefully.\u201d As it turns out, he hadn\u2019t coordinated with his staff before saying this or even told his campaign manager that he was having an interview with the Post.\n\nAnd so a scramble ensued as the campaign tried to clean up the mess the candidate had made. This culminated with Carson himself going on CNN and disavowing what he had told the Post.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As he sinks in the polls, Ben Carson's organizational failures are sending his campaign into a death spiral", "title": "Behold the Ben Carson shambles: Once a GOP frontrunner, his campaign is collapsing and flailing", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "As he sinks in the polls, Ben Carson's organizational failures are sending his campaign into a death spiral", "title": "Behold the Ben Carson shambles: Once a GOP frontrunner, his campaign is collapsing and flailing", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/24/behold_the_ben_carson_shambles_once_a_gop_frontrunner_his_campaign_is_collapsing_and_flailing/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/gop-2016-carson.jpeg19-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As he sinks in the polls, Ben Carson's organizational failures are sending his campaign into a death spiral", "title": "Behold the Ben Carson shambles: Once a GOP frontrunner, his campaign is collapsing and flailing", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/gop-2016-carson.jpeg19-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 2016 Elections, 2016 GOP primary, 2016 Republican primary, Ben Carson, iowa primary, Iowa Republicans, Washington Post", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: 2016 Elections, 2016 GOP primary, 2016 Republican primary, Ben Carson, iowa primary, Iowa Republicans, Washington Post, Elections News, Politics NewsBen Carson\u2019s presidential campaign is in trouble.\nThis culminated with Carson himself going on CNN and disavowing what he had told the Post.\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at every aspect of the campaign right now,\u201d he told the Post.\nAnd so a scramble ensued as the campaign tried to clean up the mess the candidate had made.\nEverywhere you look, there are big red warning signs flashing urgently and signaling the coming collapse."}
