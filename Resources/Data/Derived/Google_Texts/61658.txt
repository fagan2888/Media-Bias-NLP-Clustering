A casino owner made a donation to an Alabama school district for students lacking insurance allowing them to take home iPads.

The Montgomery Advertiser reports that VictoryLand owner Milton McGregor announced this week that he donated $25,750 to cover the $50 insurance payments for 515 students at three Macon County schools.

McGregor felt compelled to help after hearing about students' inability to pay insurance costs for iPads following Apple's donation to the three cash-strapped schools this summer.

Apple's grant provided iPads for students at BTW-Tuskegee, Tuskegee Public Elementary and Notasulga High School. The grant was part of its ConnectED grants that coincided with the White House's ConnectED initiative.

The grant also aided Macon County in updating its internet infrastructure within the school buildings and provided professional development for employees.
