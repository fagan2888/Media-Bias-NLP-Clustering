Luke Shaefer, co-author of the important new book, $2.00 a Day: Living on Almost Nothing in America. Co-written with the distinguished sociologist Kathryn Edin, the book includes poignant interviews with many families trying to survive on virtually no cash income in America in 2015.\n\nEdin and Shaefer document that over a million U.S. households \u2013 including about 3 million children \u2013 live in extreme poverty in which their cash incomes are less than $2 per person per day. Many of the people affected are workers \u2013 or are trying to work \u2013 within an unforgiving economy that offers meager wages and hours to those stuck at the very bottom of the blue-collar economy.\n\nIn Part 1, Shaefer and I talk about how families survive on such meager incomes. What are the accompanying costs to adults and children of doing without basic necessities, of moving from shelter to shelter, of precariously doubling-up with friends and relatives, of having to sell blood plasma, or of becoming dependent on a dubious male partner who offers one\u2019s children a couch to sleep on?\n\nTwenty years ago, traditional cash welfare was highly flawed, but at least offered some floor for poor parents and kids with no other source of support. What happened to these programs after welfare reform? In Part 2, I ask Shaefer whether Medicaid is helping these poorest of the poor \u2013 and whether Medicaid expansion might offer hope for the poorest states. Since I write frequently for this blog about Medicaid, we\u2019ve led with that segment and included a transcript of that Medicaid-specific conversation below, but for a fuller discussion of the book and its findings, be sure to watch Part 1.\n\n\n\nWriting about this book in the New York Times, William Julius Wilson concludes:\n\nThis essential book is a call to action, and one hopes it will accomplish what \u00adMichael Harrington\u2019s \u201cThe Other America\u201d achieved in the 1960s \u2014 arousing both the nation\u2019s consciousness and conscience about the plight of a growing number of invisible citizens. The rise of such absolute poverty since the passage of welfare reform belies all the categorical talk about opportunity and the American dream.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more important or poignant subject this campaign season. It\u2019s a special pleasure to hold this conversation, since I was one of Professor Shaefer\u2019s graduate school mentors.\n\nTranscript of Medicaid discussion:\n\nHarold Pollack: Hey Luke, this is Harold Pollack at healthinsurance.org doing a Curbside Consult with Luke Shaefer and this is actually sort of a little interlude in the interview that we did. We were talking about your book if you want to hold up your book \u2026\n\nLuke Shaefer: With pleasure \u2026\n\nHarold: \u2026 $2 a Day, which is just a rocking best-seller by academic standards at the moment. It\u2019s really had a big impact and we were talking about how you\u2019ve been doing briefings in Washington DC at the Center on Budget & Policy Priorities and with Senate folks and have some great excerpts planned which I won\u2019t spoil but a lot of media outlets that are showing interest in the book. Why do you think by the way it\u2019s attracted such interest?\n\nLuke: I think that\u2019s a good question. I mean I\u2019ve been interested to see what people picked up on and I think of all the articles that have gotten play perhaps the one that has come back to mean more the most was an excerpt in The Atlantic \u2026 it really focused on Jessica Compton \u2026 one of the moms who tries to donate plasma twice a week. It\u2019s the only source of income that her family has.\n\nThat seemed to have a very much a visceral impact on people I think so \u2026 so you know what we really try to do was tell a big-picture story about what\u2019s going on in the low-wage labor market and what\u2019s going on with our government programs for the poor. And a big piece of that is Medicaid, so I\u2019m excited to talk about that. But to do it through stories and to do it through people\u2019s lives and I think to some just degree we were successful in sort of capturing people\u2019s attention and bringing some of it home, so I\u2019m really happy about that.\n\nThe impact of Medicaid\n\nHarold: Now let\u2019s talk about Medicaid because Medicaid is the main tool in some ways that we\u2019ve used certainly to provide healthcare to poor people and I should say that you and I actually \u2026 our first work together was on Medicaid and on the impact of Medicaid and CHIP for kids \u2026 and maybe we should just start by reviewing since you\u2019re the first author \u2026 we should at least mention that I\u2019m sure that everyone that\u2019s listening to this is a regular subscriber to Health Services Research and some of the other journals \u2026\n\n[cross talk]\n\nHarold: But why is CHIP so important and Medicaid so important for low-income kids?\n\nLuke: Well, we note this in our book and it was really the genesis of this paper of one of the great things we did in the 1990s was pass SCHIP in 1997 \u2026 so sort of on the heels of the \u201896 welfare reform. And I think going along with this trend towards trying to provide supports to low-income working families.\n\nSo we did this expansion of SCHIP and allowed states some flexibility in just providing coverage to poor and low-income kids of the income distribution and states really responded. And I think all states have SCHIP eligibility thresholds that reach 200 percent or twice the property rate \u2026 some go up to 300 and even a little bit more than that \u2026 and it really caused a shock downwards in the number of uninsured kids.\n\nAnd there was lot of concern at the time about crowdout \u2026 how much were these kids that would\u2019ve had private insurance that was just shifting over to public insurance. And you and I, as I recall, wanted to try to further develop the conversation about what the impacts of SCHIP were and we were thinking in particular public health insurance tends to be more comprehensive and costs families less \u2026 you know, less in premiums \u2026 less on co-pays \u2026\n\nAnd so you might see this big financial effect of reducing what people were paying themselves and there was some methodological challenges of selection into the program and we particularly saw that kids who were in worse health tended to move from private to public and we dealt with that in using some instrumental variables that were well documented in the literature.\n\nAnd we found this quite significant impact on reducing medical costs for families of a switch from private to public and I think since then that\u2019s been substantiated in some experimental results that we had out of Oregon of course.\n\nHarold: And we\u2019ll get to Oregon in a minute but I think just to build on what you said for a moment \u2026 both the good and bad about what we found \u2026 good in terms of sick kids in particular really benefited from going on to CHIP and there was definitely more of a movement of kids with health issues into the program than there was among other kids and at one point we calculated it\u2019s worth something like $1,500 per family that was provided when you think about the two-dollar-a-day standard in your book that\u2019s a substantial amount.\n\nNow one of the challenges that really bring out the importance of the Medicaid expansion is implicit in that paper which is as we expanded CHIP there are more and more families where adults would go without insurance and they\u2019d be like \u201cOK, I can get my kid on CHIP. I can\u2019t really afford insurance for myself \u2026\u201d and there was a lot of that in our data and there\u2019s actually a lot of that in your book \u2026 a lot of the kids that you talk about they\u2019re pretty well insured as you describe it but not at all true and for the adults.\n\nSobering personal stories\n\nLuke: Yep that\u2019s absolutely what we found in fact I might say that Medicaid did the best of blanket covering people \u2026 for kids and then for the adults, we would see a lot that weren\u2019t covered and we had a few experiences \u2026 which I think we\u2019re not that uncommon \u2026 where often, when a state hits a budget crunch, it\u2019s adult Medicaid services that are the first to go \u2026 so like adult dental coverage in Medicaid.\n\nWe saw examples where we had Jennifer Hernandez in Chicago \u2026 has a long work history \u2026 super hard worker. Her gums were in just awful condition. And I found it a little hard look at her I\u2019m embarrassed to say. We \u2026 I actually had a trained social worker call around the city of Chicago just trying to find a free dental clinic that would give her free care. She has no money and there was not a \u2026 we couldn\u2019t find a place \u2026 that\u2019s not to say doesn\u2019t exist but trained social worker couldn\u2019t find it and we looked into it the adult Medicaid dental insurance had just been cut like a month before we met her and I think that\u2019s indicative \u2026 you know so you had on coverage not on coverage for the adults as well as sort of changes in what that means at least around the edges.\n\nHarold: Now how do people in states that just didn\u2019t expand Medicaid \u2026 I mean you went down to the Mississippi Delta and actually I guess in your Tennessee work Medicaid did not expand \u2026 was it palpable that there was a real difference there for families because there was no Medicaid expansion or is that something that\u2019s a little early to see? What you see as far as the Medicaid issue goes.\n\nLuke: Well I think we saw it so like one interesting story was Paul Heckwelder and his wife in Cleveland \u2026 they were in one of these situations where all of their kids were grown. They had like 20 people living in their two-bedroom house but she was terribly sick and had no health insurance so I think she was maybe 59, 60 \u2026 she was in this sort of gap. So all of her kids are grown she wasn\u2019t eligible and she had a stack of medical bills that was I mean I think we took a picture of it like it was this high.\n\nAnd that should be solved in Ohio I mean at least there\u2019s something we can get her on now with the expansion right and we saw that in Chicago too \u2026 I think the adults were more likely but you know we were mostly with adults with kids but I think everyone we talked to in Appalachia \u2026 the parents were not covered and in the Mississippi Delta I think I mean we didn\u2019t exactly look at this but you know another problem in the Mississippi Delta was just plain access.\n\nYou know, there was a county one of the counties in the area we were in \u2026 there\u2019s no ambulance service, we were told by multiple people, so people can\u2019t even get to the hospital.\n\nMedicaid\u2019s role in the \u2018ecosystem\u2019\n\nHarold: You know one of the points that that raises is that there\u2019s sort of two ways that Medicaid expansion helps \u2026 it helps the individual secure access but it also provides the financial foundation for the whole ecosystem of care and so one of the things that so many of the severely poor people that you\u2019re interviewing \u2026 even if they\u2019re in a state that has Medicaid expansion \u2026 if they\u2019re undocumented or if they have life issues they may be turning to things like the emergency department and one of the things that has been really strong since health reform is that uncompensated care costs have just plummeted in the expansion states and they haven\u2019t budged in the non-expansion states at all.\n\nAnd if you look at all the major private for-profit hospitals in their financial reports, they\u2019ve all emphasized this and in fact their stock all spikes whenever there was a \u2026 both Supreme Court decisions that were favorable to the Affordable Care Act \u2026 their stock spiked the moment that there was favorable news. And so if you want to pay for an ambulance \u2026 even if an individual is uninsured \u2026 for that ride if there\u2019s sort of seven other people that you can get paid for, then you can actually have an ambulance.\n\nLuke: It\u2019s almost like an insurance pool for the providers. I mean it reduces the risk, I guess, I\u2019m not sure how to say that.\n\nHarold: And there\u2019s also economies of scale that make it easy for \u2026 you know if there\u2019s big fixed costs, Medicaid can help pay for those and then it\u2019s a lot easier to help that extra patient who\u2019s got an issue that\u2019s hard to get paid for and you go down to the Mississippi Delta and there\u2019s just no oxygen for that medical ecosystem. It\u2019s a really tough situation and it\u2019s a really tough situation for the local economy too because probably some of the people you interviewed could have driven that ambulance or could have done something.\n\nResults since reform implementation\n\nLuke: Yep. Exactly. Have we seen \u2026 so we\u2019ve seen reductions in uncompensated care \u2026 have we seen any changes in the cost curve, Harold? Do we think it\u2019s going to result in lowering costs overall or does it still sort of remain to be seen?\n\nHarold: I think it remains to be seen. The remarkable thing is that it certainly has not increased costs. I mean, Medicaid is so cheap, compared to other forms of insurance. The irony is all of the political debate is about people who are really not that expensive to take care of and \u2026 on average \u2026 I mean some of the people you interviewed had really serious health problems and have to be dealt with. A lot of those people \u2026 they have pretty basic needs and overall, they\u2019re not that expensive.\n\nSo what\u2019s happened in terms of the cost curve is that the overall cost curve has been bent down in a favorable direction and there are parts of ACA that have helped with that. I think it\u2019s mostly helped in Medicare and some other parts of the system. But the Medicaid expansion has been quite economical and I think its\u2019 been \u2026 I think there have been some services that there\u2019s more intense needs for and some of it comes up in your book \u2026 a lot of people using mental and behavioral health services.\n\nThere\u2019s just a lot of mental health need among some of the new enrollees so we have to deal with that. We haven\u2019t figured out how to get some of the systems like substance abuse treatment that have existed off on their own in a silo \u2026 they have to figure out how to work with Medicaid. And some of that\u2019s very nitty gritty stuff [crosstalk] does our computer system bill Medicaid and all that kind of stuff.\n\nSo the jury is still out about the blocking and tackling of it but one thing that we do know is that the cost of it has \u2026 you know the forcecast for costs going out are actually lower than they were predicted to be in 2010 for Medicaid even taking into account that not every state\u2019s expanded and all that kind of stuff.\n\nYou also mentioned the Oregon experiment which speaks to how Medicaid helps but maybe doesn\u2019t help enough in peoples lives. I wonder if you wanted to pick up on that.\n\nThe Oregon experiment\n\nLuke: Well yeah so the Oregon Medicaid experiment was sort of a randomized trial of adults who were not eligible in Oregon off of a very long waiting list and my interpretation \u2026 and you\u2019re more expert than this \u2026 we randomized and we followed health outcomes for a couple of years and financial outcomes and mental health outcomes and the physical health outcomes, I think, were maybe a disappointment to people that there wasn\u2019t a lot of impact in things that you know some of our best people thought we should be able to impact.\n\nThe financial outcomes, I think, were pretty good \u2026 right \u2026 that we actually saw reduced out-of-pocket expenditures maybe at levels that were in the similar scale of what we found in our paper and actually there was some really positive mental health results \u2026 right \u2026 that we reduced sort of anxiety and depression. And as I\u2019ve been meeting with families, I think, you know in terms of the physical health, there\u2019s just this \u2026 it seems to me like there\u2019s this compounding effect for people at the very bottom that you\u2019re talking about repeated exposure to stress and to trauma.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know if I mentioned in our last segment but I got into the literature on toxic stress and was \u2026 it was just really quite striking as I\u2019d read the papers and then go out into the field and I\u2019d feel like I could see the manifestations of toxic stress exactly as they sort of had been written about in the paper. And I think it just takes a long time to, I think, impact health outcomes when you\u2019re dealing with that situation and frankly I think it\u2019s probably too much to ask the health care system to do on its own \u2026 you know the problems that are really impacting the health and I know you\u2019ve written on this \u2026 are really outside of the domain.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got these unstable living arrangements \u2026 unstable jobs \u2026 it\u2019s very hard to keep continuity of care \u2026 right \u2026 among physicians and you know \u2026 if you\u2019re just constantly dealing with the stress of \u201cwhere\u2019s my \u2026 where\u2019s the money gonna come to keep on going for another day\u201d \u2026 you know \u2026 I\u2019m just not sure we can sort of expect that providing health insurance to solve sort of all the health problems that people face.\n\nHarold: I think that\u2019s right although I also think \u2026 I tend to think the Oregon one \u2026 that it was more helpful than a lot of people have taken from it in a couple of ways. One is some of the basic issues people worry about at Medicaid turned out to be much less of an issue. There\u2019s this stereotype that if you have Medicaid you can\u2019t get in to see your doctor \u2026 that it\u2019s basically like a fake insurance card \u2026\n\nAnd people were very happy with the coverage that they got. People get into \u2026 all the data we have are when people get onto Medicaid, they get appointments \u2026 you know, they\u2019re just as happy with their coverage as basically they would be under the kind of private insurance they\u2019re likely to get if they say \u201cAre they as happy with Medicaid as they might be with insurance that Harold Pollock gets that cost $20,000 a year for my family?\u201d Probably not. There\u2019s a difference there but that\u2019s not what that\u2019s not what they\u2019re going to be getting \u2026 and also some of the expectations \u2026 the Oregon experiment was pretty short and there weren\u2019t that many people with serious health problems.\n\nSo we really have no idea based \u2026 I think we learned from that experiment if you\u2019re expecting a really quick benefit on something like high blood pressure, you\u2019re probably not going to see it right away.\n\nLuke: Yeah, it\u2019s going to take a while \u2026 and was it a pretty low take-up, Harold, in terms of the take-up group?\n\nHarold: Yeah. It was pretty low take-up for a variety of reasons just having to do with the mechanics of running an experiment. It was beautifully done experiment that took all of that stuff into account but what that led to was it meant that you would\u2019ve had to have seen a pretty dramatic effect in a pretty small number of people in order for the experiment to actually see that there\u2019s benefit.\n\nSo if we for example looked at people with diabetes \u2026 were we lowering their blood sugar level? Really, they just didn\u2019t have the ability to see that although I think that I was disappointed that we didn\u2019t see more benefit for some things like blood pressure and also things like smoking \u2026 I think this is where gets into the whole psychosocial dimension. All your folks were \u2026 a lot of your folks were smoking \u2026 and we don\u2019t see any real benefits from improving people\u2019s health behaviors and I think that that\u2019s a big \u2026 that\u2019s one area where health insurance just seems to be less powerful than we\u2019d like it to be.\n\nSo if you look at things like obesity, diet, smoking \u2026 you know \u2026 you really don\u2019t see any concrete evidence that we\u2019re getting people to live healthier lives although we do see that we\u2019re managing people\u2019s health conditions better. So it\u2019s both \u2026 so it\u2019s a half-full half-empty thing: people don\u2019t have to worry about losing their house because they\u2019re going to get sick which is fantastic \u2026\n\nLuke: That\u2019s a good outcome \u2026\n\nHarold: Yeah and you in your case people will be less likely to be homeless or chased around by bill collectors \u2026 But we\u2019ve got some work to do on the health side. So I know \u2026\n\nHope for the system?\n\nLuke: You\u2019re probably watching the new health insurance numbers that came out a couple of days ago and I thought it\u2019s striking that sharp reduction in the number of uninsured. I think we went from 13-something percent to 10.1 percent. I mean that\u2019s that\u2019s a success \u2026\n\nHarold: Yeah out it\u2019s kind of amazing especially since it\u2019s been a rocky road; it\u2019s been a big challenge, but I think you could argue that the past five years have been the best five years in the history of health policy if you look at \u2026 costs have really come under control to a much greater degree \u2026 The quality of healthcare has gone up a lot \u2026 More people are insured and there\u2019s been continued progress that I don\u2019t think people fully appreciate. Death rates have really been dropping consistently over like the past 20 years and it\u2019s been continuing.\n\nIf you look at age-adjusted death rates in America it\u2019s just remarkable \u2026 we just continue to \u2026 largely because cardiovascular diseases \u2026 we\u2019re doing a better job on \u2026 smoking is down \u2026 Americans are really living longer and the health system is genuinely getting better. Now it shouldn\u2019t cost $3 trillion to get the kind of outcomes we\u2019re seeing but I\u2019m thinking, you know, if we can have another five years that looks like the last five years in terms of progress \u2026 especially if we can get a couple of states like Texas and Florida and Mississippi to come into the Medicaid expansion \u2026 we\u2019re going to have a healthier country.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a little hard to see that now because we\u2019re sitting here debating Donald Trump-level of policy discourse, but it\u2019s there and I hope that \u2026 I think your book actually is going to contribute to this because it highlights the problems that we\u2019re not dealing with well at the very bottom where we really do have a lot of public health problems we could deal with.\n\nAnd so congratulations on its success but also I\u2019m rooting for your book success partly because I\u2019m rooting for you but partly because I just think that it\u2019s highlighting these issues that we just we need to get to and that we have the capacity now with the Medicaid expansion and other tools to really go after in a better way.\n\nLuke: Thanks, Harold.\n\nHarold: Ithink this is good place to to stop this portion of the interview but I\u2019m very gratified that you\u2019re getting the kind of attention that you\u2019re getting because I think there are a lot of those people living on $2 a day could use a little exposure and your book does that beautifully so congratulations on that.\n\nLuke: I appreciate that \u2026 and in this interview I feel like I learned more from you then you possibly learned from me so \u2026 It\u2019s always good to talk to you.\n\nHarold: Well, thank you. You paid me tuition so it seems like it should go that way. Great to talk to you.\n\nLuke: All right.
