But with President Barack Obama about to release his eighth and final budget, you can really feel the chill between him and congressional Republicans.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nFor starters: The White House plans to roll out a $10-a-barrel \u201cfee\u201d on oil as part of its budget on Tuesday, to pay for a \u201cclean\u201d transportation agenda that would include investments in high-speed rail, self-driving cars and a variety of other initiatives. (The Agenda\u2019s Michael Grunwald was first on that: http://politi.co/1UOlNpc. And Pro Transportation\u2019s Lauren Gardner has more: http://politico.pro/1L1K4CO)\n\nThis might be about as good a time as any for Obama to propose this sort of tax, given the tumble that oil prices have taken. But while the oil companies would be charged that tax, it would almost certainly lead to higher prices at the pump, as ExxonMobil and the rest pass at least some of the new costs on to consumers. And surprising virtually no one, top GOP lawmakers including House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady almost immediately lashed out at the plan, as Pro Energy\u2019s Elana Schor reports. http://politico.pro/20v180c\n\nBut come on \u2014 partisan sniping over budget proposals that are unlikely to become law is a rite of passage in Washington.\n\nThis is new, however: Sen. Mike Enzi and Rep. Tom Price, the chairmen of the congressional budget committees, decided not to invite Obama\u2019s budget director to the Hill to discuss the president\u2019s plan. Both Enzi and Price said having Shaun Donovan testify would basically be a waste of time, as our Brian Faler reported. http://politico.pro/1R7QExO\n\nWhite House budget chiefs appear to have testified about their administration\u2019s frameworks for close to two decades running, leading the administration and its congressional allies, like Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), to call out Republicans for breaking protocol. \u201cThis appalling decision to reject long-standing, bipartisan tradition is the latest evidence that the tea party controls this Congress,\u201d said Van Hollen, the top Democrat at House Budget.\n\nANOTHER WEEK IS ALMOST IN THE BOOKS. Hope everyone\u2019s getting their queso ready for Super Bowl Sunday. We\u2019re hoping our friends who are Panthers or Broncos fans can avoid each other come Sunday. While you\u2019re waiting for the commercials, let us know the scoop. Email:bbecker@politico.com, teckert@politico.com, bfaler@politico.com, kodonnell@politico.com. Twitter: @berniebecker3, @tobyeckert, @brian_faler, @katyodonnell_ , @POLITICOPro and @Morning_Tax.\n\nDON\u2019T WANT TO LET GO: As we noted Thursday, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee haven\u2019t exactly been broadcasting that dealing with FAA taxes is on their to-do list. But your Morning Tax author also notes that senior GOP tax writers suggested Thursday that they\u2019ll need plenty of convincing to go along with House Transportation Chairman Bill Shuster\u2019s plan to shift oversight of air traffic control to a nonprofit board, and to largely trade out the taxes that pay for the system for user fees. Tax writers are unnerved both because they don\u2019t think they understand Shuster\u2019s ideas yet, and because they like having control over FAA taxes. \"The last thing we want to do is to give up oversight and the ability to have input on how FAA operates,\" said Rep. Dave Reichert. He added that Shuster\u2019s plan is \"an idea. But it's not an idea that's the only idea.\" http://politico.pro/1PlAL2l\n\nTHE NEVER-ENDING \u2018CADILLAC TAX\u2019 BATTLE: The Obamacare tax on costly insurance plans isn\u2019t scheduled to go into effect for another four years \u2014 and lots of folks around town believe it never will \u2014 but the lobbying remains fast and furious. Our Brian Faler reports that organized labor, Obama\u2019s allies on lots of other issues, says it won\u2019t be swayed by the White House\u2019s proposal to tinker with the Cadillac tax. http://politico.pro/1Pa8zRX\n\nOn the Hill, Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch and Rep. Erik Paulsen (R-Minn.), a Ways and Means member, want to blunt the Cadillac tax\u2019s impact on Health Savings Accounts and other benefits key to the middle class, Brian and Katy O\u2019Donnell report. http://politico.pro/23Mu9Ud\n\nPROBLEM SOLVED?: It turns out any concerns about long-term systems outages at the IRS were unnecessary, and we can all go back to waiting by the mailbox for our tax refunds. The agency said Thursday that it started processing tax returns again at around 5 p.m., about a day after announcing a hardware failure had halted that process. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said the agency worked nonstop since Wednesday to get everything up and running. \u201cOur processing systems are back in business. Taxpayers should see little, if any, impact on their tax returns or refunds,\u201d said Koskinen, who nonetheless apologized for any inconvenience.\n\n\u2014 WHAT REALLY HAPPENED? In its statement, the IRS said it\u2019s investigating what caused Wednesday\u2019s outage, but added the situation appeared to be a hardware failure and the agency didn\u2019t suggest that any outside sabotage had occurred. (For whatever it\u2019s worth, the agency did admit when cyber thieves had breached a transcript program last year.) But House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, speaking Thursday before the IRS systems were fixed, told Fox Business that \u201cmy initial gut reaction is that may be a hack.\u201d Chaffetz added that he didn\u2019t think systems just conked out the way the IRS suggested. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they run out of batteries or something,\u201d he said.\n\nBERNIE VS. HILLARY, CONT\u2019D: We\u2019re admittedly partial to taxes, so this opinion could be somewhat biased. But taxes always seem to be just below the surface in the Democratic contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, with Clinton\u2019s plan of limiting tax increases to the rich showing off her pragmatism and Sanders\u2019 idea of using broader tax hikes to pay for a single-payer health system underscoring his call to revolution.\n\nThat does not mean that taxes played a big role in Thursday\u2019s debate between Clinton and Sanders. (They did not.) Clinton knocked Sanders\u2019 tax plan, saying that a number of outside analysts have questioned the math underpinning it. Sanders talked up a financial transaction tax, and went after Boeing and General Electric for their offshore tax practices. Maybe more next time.\n\nZERO\u2019S A LONG WAY DOWN: The NYT\u2019s Josh Barro takes a deeper dive into Marco Rubio\u2019s proposal to eliminate taxes on capital gains and dividends \u2014 which, let\u2019s be honest, doesn\u2019t mesh with the plan\u2019s more family-friendly ideas, like increasing the child tax credit. Barro notes zeroing out capital gains was much too far for Mitt Romney, frequently pilloried as the prototypical GOP rich guy. But there are economic rationales for taxing investment income less than wages, and Barro casts Rubio\u2019s proposal as a microcosm of his battle with Sen. Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cThe fight over taxes mirrors the divide that has emerged between the Republican Party\u2019s elite supporters and its voter base. Mr. Cruz\u2019s and Donald Trump\u2019s tax plans offer significantly lower tax rates than Mr. Rubio\u2019s to the sorts of highly paid workers that form a key Republican voting constituency. But they are not as generous to people who live off investment income \u2014 a group that, not incidentally, includes many of the people who fund Republican super PACs.\u201d http://nyti.ms/1SvL4ak\n\nINTERNATIONAL NEWS \u2014\n\nDON\u2019T CALL IT A COMEBACK: Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president, is making tax cuts a central plank in his pitch to regain his old office, the Financial Times reports. \u201cSarkozy, who lost his bid to retain the presidency four years ago to socialist leader Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, promised to cut taxes on households and businesses by \u20ac25bn in the first few months of a new term, including a 10 percent cut in income taxes and a \u20ac13bn reduction in employers\u2019 social charges. He also said he would abolish the wealth tax, increase the pension age from 62 to 64 by 2025 and allow companies and their workers to scrap the 35-hour maximum working week.\u201d http://on.ft.com/1nKHxrf\n\nIT\u2019S STILL SWITZERLAND: Federal officials on Thursday charged bank Julius Baer of Zurich with conspiring to help American clients evade their U.S. taxes. The Justice Department and the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York also announced that they reached a deferred prosecution agreement with Julius Baer, in which the bank admits to wrongdoing and agrees to pay more than a half-billion in penalties. And two Julius Baer client advisers pleaded guilty in Manhattan, after being originally charged in 2011 and then going underground until Monday.\n\nSTATE UPDATE \u2014\n\nOREGON SECRETARY OF STATE WILL HELP INVESTIGATE ENERGY TAX CREDITS: Individuals who applied for the controversial Business Energy Tax Credit are being investigated by Oregon Secretary of State Jeanne Atkins for fraud and misconduct, The Oregonian reports. \u201cShe said the goal is to conduct a preliminary audit on a random sampling of the 12,000 tax credits the department issued after 2007 to determine if there are systemic issues or individual tax credits that warrant a forensic review or referral to the State Department of Justice.\u201d Atkins indicated the review was authorized after discovering there were major gaps in the files documenting some $1 billion in state tax credits. \u201cThe agency was overwhelmed by a tsunami of tax-credit applicants in the years after the Legislature super-sized its energy incentives, making them the most generous state subsidy for renewable energy and conservation projects in the country.\u201d http://bit.ly/1PVesQo\n\nGET ACCESS TO PRO\u2019S NEW BUDGET AND APPROPRIATIONS BRIEF : The fiscal 2017 budget and appropriations season kicks off in two business days.
