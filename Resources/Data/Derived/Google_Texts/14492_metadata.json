Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said in a statement.\n\n[READ: 'The Interview' and the Reckoning]\n\n\u201cThis is only the latest example of the need for serious legislation to improve the sharing of information between the private sector and the government to help companies strengthen cybersecurity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe must pass an information sharing bill as quickly as possible next year.\"\n\nFeinstein has been among the lawmakers pushing for comprehensive cybersecurity reform for several years. Previous attempts failed because of pushback from businesses about fears that setting standards on cybersecurity or data breach notification would be counterproductive or expensive, so Congress has shifted most of its attention to bills that would ease information sharing on threats between the government and companies.\n\nThe latest information sharing bill proposed by Feinstein also failed this year in part because of criticism from civil liberties advocates such as the Center for Democracy and Technology, which argued the bill would share too much private data with the government and enable broader surveillance.\n\nThe House is losing one of the top advocates for cybersecurity information sharing with the retirement of Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich, but Rep. C.A. \u201cDutch\u201d Ruppersberger, D-Md., tells U.S. News he hopes the Sony hack \u201cwill move Congress to pass cyber information sharing legislation and deliver it quickly to the president\u2019s desk.\u201d\n\n\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s cyber attack on Sony was extremely severe, forcing Sony to take its entire system offline, destroying computers, and stealing confidential information,\u201d Ruppersberger says. \u201cWe need to stop dealing with cyber attacks after the damage is done. We need to have foresight and prevent them from occurring in the first place.\u201d\n\nPrevious information sharing bills introduced by Rogers and Ruppersberger have passed the Republican-controlled House, so it is possible that the new Republican majority in the Senate could ease passage with fewer voices concerned about the privacy risks of those bills.\n\n[ALSO: Sony Hack Takes Darker Turn With 'Interview' Terror Threat]\n\nInformation sharing between government and the private sector can be helpful if legislation is well-crafted to ensure data privacy, but it will not be enough to prevent online attacks like the breach of Sony\u2019s networks, says Jake Laperruque, a fellow with the Center for Democracy and Technology.\n\n\u201cThe info sharing that these bills would grant would not have prevented these attacks, which were the result of poor digital hygiene and system monitoring,\u201d Laperruque says. \u201cThese companies have the capacity to take stronger measures.\u201d\n\nA lack of cybersecurity preparations at U.S. companies are blamed for enabling hackers to breach networks and steal data, according to recent studies by groups including the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank and PricewaterhouseCoopers industry research firm. Only 49 percent of companies surveyed by PwC have a formal plan for dealing with security breaches conducted by current and former employees, for instance.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Cybersecurity [News]", "title": "Lawmakers Demand Cybersecurity Reform After Sony Hack", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "The breach of Sony's systems is the latest example of the need for cybersecurity reform.", "title": "Lawmakers Demand Cybersecurity Reform After Sony Hack", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/12/19/lawmakers-demand-cybersecurity-reform-after-sony-hack", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/26/95/f307fb5142b4ade6ee25a39dee57/141219-sonylot-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The breach of Sony's systems is the latest example of the need for cybersecurity reform.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Lawmakers Demand Cybersecurity Reform After Sony Hack"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Dec. 19, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Tom Risen,Pulse,Sony,North Korea,cybersecurity,Cybersecurity [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The breach of Sony's systems is the latest example of the need for cybersecurity reform."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd891d\"", "article_summary": "The House is losing one of the top advocates for cybersecurity information sharing with the retirement of Rep.
