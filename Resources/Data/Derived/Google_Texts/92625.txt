California and its counties are exploring ways to provide undocumented immigrants with access to health care.

In a California Healthline audio report by Tara Siler, experts say the state could be a good test for the rest of the country to determine if the benefits of providing health care to such residents outweigh the costs.

The report includes comments from:

Candice Anderson, a Contra Costa County supervisor;

Rosa Maria Arriaga, a 72-year-old patient;

Álvaro Fuentes, director of Contra Costa County’s Community Clinic Consortium;

Gerald Kominski, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research;

Gabrielle Lessard, a health policy attorney with the National Immigration Law Center;

Ira Mehlman, with the Federation for American Immigration Reform;

Teshina Wilson, a physician at a Richmond clinic; and

Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California (Siler, California Healthline, 11/11).
