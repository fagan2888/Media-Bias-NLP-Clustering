I am thirty-two pounds lighter; my waist is ten inches tinier and my clothing four sizes smaller.\n\nNever in my wildest dreams did I think I\u2019d ever see this again. I had given up trying to lose weight and just accepted that I would always be stuck in a body I hated.\n\nThen a stroke saved my life.\n\nAnd here I am at the beginning of the first full year of making my dreams come true. In addition to my shrinking body my confidence has soared, my mojo has come back and I even caught a teen-age young man flirting with me at the grocery store. No, I\u2019m not a Cougar but it is sure good for my ego!\n\nSince my last bariatric column the holidays have come and gone. I had no doubt I would not overdo it with all the tasty food that comes with that time of year. As of January first I had only gained five pounds. (The national average is up to ten pounds.) A week later I was back to where I should be and the effort wasn\u2019t difficult. Ever since my body started to recognize leptin, the hormone that tells you to stop eating, my endeavor to become a healthy weight is becoming a reality.\n\nAt my last check up with Dr. Carter he said I\u2019m doing great and that my stomach is the size it should be. I was afraid it may have stretched out over the course of the three months in between appointments, but my fears were unfounded. And with that, the thought of my height and weight being proportionate again no longer seems like an unattainable dream; it becomes more real each day. Every time the scale or tape measure registers smaller numbers, the more my hope becomes truth.\n\nExercise for me consists of an hour on the treadmill on a slight incline and a fast pace that is not quite running. I also clean houses three times a week which burns lots of calories too.\n\nMy friend Kathy Dent of Kathy\u2019s Fitness has been a cheerleader for me from the beginning and is assisting me in starting a strength training program. Kathy has lost 200 pounds by diet and exercise alone. She says that once she started strength training the weight came off much faster than without it.\n\nFriends and family have noticed my weight loss and have told me so, especially in reference to my baggy jeans. Dr. Carter said it looked like there was enough room to carry rocks. My friend Carol said I looked like a size 16. When I started this journey I was a size 22. There was no way I could be a size 16. I had made it to size 20 and agreed that I should try an 18, but 16? No way. I bought the 18\u2019s and wore them for a day. They were too baggy. Could it be, alas, that I could get into a 16? Gathering my courage I took the 18\u2019s back and exchanged them for 16\u2019s. I didn\u2019t bother to try them on since I would eventually be this size if not now.\n\nI should have bought a lottery ticket that day. They fit. For the first time in twenty years I could get into jeans this size! Even though it\u2019s not the size I want to stay I never thought I\u2019d see this stage again.\n\nAnd with that my Self love grew. I\u2019m not worth more now that my body is smaller. I\u2019ve always been a person of great worth and value but for various reasons didn\u2019t know it before. In the past my weight loss efforts failed and failed again. What I didn\u2019t know was that my own body was sabotaging my attempts to improve my health. Now that my body recognizes leptin it\u2019s not difficult to stay the course. I will only backslide by my own actions and nothing else. And all this is to say the realization that I\u2019m not a failure increases. That definition has fallen to the wayside.\n\nAs a result the love I have for myself continues to grow, as yours should for you too. Happy Valentine\u2019s Day!\n\nRead more of Claire\u2019s work at Feed the Mind, Nourish the Soul in the Communities Digital News and Greater Fort Worth Writers.\n\nJoin her on Twitter; Facebook; Feed the Mind, Nourish the Soul FB Page; Greater Fort Worth Writers Group FB Page", "article_metadata": {"description": "Here I am at the beginning of the first full year of making my dreams come true.", "generator": "Powered by Visual Composer - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "author": "Claire Hickey", "og": {"site_name": "Communities Digital News", "description": "Here I am at the beginning of the first full year of making my dreams come true.", "title": "My bariatric journey: loving myself", "url": "http://www.commdiginews.com/life/my-bariatric-journey-loving-myself-36375/", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Heart-Hug-widewallpapers.net_.jpg", "height": 534}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here I am at the beginning of the first full year of making my dreams come true.", "title": "My bariatric journey: loving myself", "image": "http://www.commdiginews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Heart-Hug-widewallpapers.net_-435x375.jpg", "creator": "@commdiginews", "site": "@commdiginews", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "valentine\\'s day,health,weight loss,bariatric,claire hickey,valentines day", "propeller": "a20eada6e38f74d5c5bf31354ee9760c", "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-14T21:44:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-14T21:44:23+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Claire Hickey, Health, Valentines Day, Weight loss"}, "article_summary": "There was no way I could be a size 16.\nMy friend Carol said I looked like a size 16.\nEver since my body started to recognize leptin, the hormone that tells you to stop eating, my endeavor to become a healthy weight is becoming a reality.\nSince my last bariatric column the holidays have come and gone.\nWhen I started this journey I was a size 22."}
