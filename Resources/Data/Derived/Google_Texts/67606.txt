The sector also brought in $2.1 billion in debt and public market financing, including six IPOs, bringing the total corporate funding raised in the sector in 2014 to almost $7 billion.

"The healthcare IT sector, in the five years since we started tracking funding data, raised $8.8 billion in VC funding and another $3.6 billion in public market and debt financings bringing the total to $12.4 billion â€“ largely driven by the HITECH and Affordable Care Act," said Raj Prabhu, CEO and co-founder of Mercom Capital Group, in a news release that detailed the findings. "However, the enthusiasm in the sector shown by the VC community was not quite matched by the public markets when you look at market performance of companies that went the IPO route in 2014."
