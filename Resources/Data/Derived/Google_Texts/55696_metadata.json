Instead, he was steady and unspectacular \u2014 and probably didn\u2019t wow many Heisman voters still figuring out contenders from pretenders.\n\nWatson is content with the only role he considers important \u2014 the starting quarterback of an undefeated team seeking bigger mountains to climb as the season unfolds.\n\n\u201cMy mind is not on the Heisman right now. That\u2019s going to take care of itself,\u201d Watson said Monday. \u201cI\u2019m just here to do my part, do my job and get wins.\u201d\n\nSo far, so good \u2014 even if it\u2019s not always so pretty.\n\nClemson will look to clean things up during its bye week before facing No. 6 Notre Dame on Oct. 3. Right behind is No. 20 Georgia Tech on Oct. 10, a one-two punch that should go a long way toward determining Clemson\u2019s championship hopes and Watson\u2019s opportunity to win college football\u2019s biggest individual prize.\n\nIf Watson is concerned about the accolades, he has not shown it, said offensive lineman Eric Mac Lain.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s had (pressure) throughout his career,\u201d Mac Lain said. \u201cThis is a kid who\u2019s been successful at the college and high school rank. I\u2019ve never seen Deshaun have a weak moment to where he\u2019s too big or full of himself.\u201d\n\nWatson completed 21 of 30 passes for 199 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions in the Louisville win. The lanky 6-foot-3 sophomore also ran for 54 yards as Clemson kept things churning with 202 yards rushing, its first time over the 200-yard mark in six Atlantic Coast Conference games since posting 226 in defeating North Carolina State 41-0 last October.\n\nWatson did have a couple of stellar moments with a 32-yard touchdown pass to Hunter Renfrow to start the scoring and a 25-yard TD pass to Jordan Leggett in the third quarter that put the Tigers up for good. He also had a few throws that made you wince, particularly a pair of interceptions that blunted Clemson\u2019s momentum at the start of each half.\n\nClemson coach Dabo Swinney thought Watson was not helped by receiver Leggett on the first pick. The second one was just a bad throw, Swinney acknowledged.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one he\u2019d like to have back,\u201d the coach said.\n\nWatson also wanted back a couple of runs where he came close to breaking free before getting tripped up by Louisville.\n\n\u201cI was a little disappointed in myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI probably should\u2019ve kept standing and running and could\u2019ve scored.\u201d\n\nClemson is far from a finished product. Swinney told the story of his senior year at Alabama in 1992 when the Tide won the national championship and needed several early escapes \u2014 Alabama led Louisiana Tech 6-0 in the fourth quarter before David Palmer\u2019s 63-yard punt return TD added a cushion \u2014 to remain on track.\n\n\u201cWe got better as the year went on,\u201d Swinney said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I want to see our team do.\u201d\n\nWatson leads the ACC with seven touchdown passes, but is just sixth in passing yards per game. He\u2019s gone the past two games without the Tigers\u2019 top deep threat in Mike Williams, a 1,000-yard receiver a year ago who broke a bone in his neck in the team\u2019s opening win over Wofford.\n\nJust because Watson didn\u2019t dazzle fans with the longball against Louisville does not mean he won\u2019t later on, co-offensive coordinator Jeff Scott said.\n\n\u201cIt maybe wasn\u2019t as exciting and glamorous as we want it to be, but when the defense challenges you to be patient, I felt like we did a really good job of not trying to force things,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.gainesvilletimes.com/archives/112265/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/gainesville/article/2015/09/21/0922DeshaunWatson.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "CLEMSON \u2014 Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson isn\u2019t worried about his Heisman Trophy status or looking for the longball, not with the 11th-ranked Tigers off to a perfect start.", "title": "Clemson Tigers' quarterback Deshaun Watson looking for wins, not accolades"}, "twitter": {"site": "@gtimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Clemson Tigers' quarterback Deshaun Watson looking for wins, not accolades"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc731\"", "article_summary": "CLEMSON \u2014 Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson isn\u2019t worried about his Heisman Trophy status or looking for the longball, not with the 11th-ranked Tigers off to a perfect start.\nClemson coach Dabo Swinney thought Watson was not helped by receiver Leggett on the first pick.\nIf Watson is concerned about the accolades, he has not shown it, said offensive lineman Eric Mac Lain.\nMany were expecting Watson to put on a show for a national audience last Thursday night in Clemson\u2019s 20-17 victory over Louisville.\nWatson is content with the only role he considers important \u2014 the starting quarterback of an undefeated team seeking bigger mountains to climb as the season unfolds."}
