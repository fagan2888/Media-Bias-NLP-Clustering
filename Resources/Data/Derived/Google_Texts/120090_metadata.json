The union\u2019s 1,900 members do such jobs as housekeeper, lab assistant, receptionist, and certified nursing assistant. The big sticking point is staffing. While Kaiser\u2019s member numbers grow (spurred by the Affordable Care Act) and profits soar, it has closed its Honolulu urgent care clinic and laid off staff. The weeklong walkout follows four one-day strikes since 2013. Local 5 and the National Union of Healthcare Workers are the only Kaiser unions with still-open contracts. In January, NUHW\u2019s mental health workers in California held their own weeklong strike, also over staffing\u2014while the California Nurses Association reached a deal, averting strike plans. The national agreement between Kaiser and the coalition of unions led by the Service Employees (SEIU) expires in September. \u2013 Alexandra Bradbury\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I first started in 2004, patient care was a lot more personal. We were able to get to know the patients. Lines were not chaotic. CEOs used to walk around and get to know members and our concerns. Now there are long lines at the pharmacy and cashier registration desk, and longer waits on mail-order prescriptions\u2026\n\nWhat started as a two- to three-minute patient intake now takes five to 10 minutes. It is no longer a personal experience, but a list of 21 questions for the patient to fill out. When the appointment is done, we are administering immunizations, scheduling short-term appointments, and conducting minor procedures. This repeats through the entire day\u2014on top of phone calls, patient emails, and patient walk-ins\u2026\n\nA lot of times, I don\u2019t get the chance to sit until my lunch break or at the end of my shift\u2026 By the end of the workday I feel like I\u2019ve worked enough for two to three people.\n\n\u2013 Jonah Pascual, medical assistant, Honolulu\n\n\u2666 \u2666 \u2666\n\nWorkers like myself have been quite frustrated for several years due to the decrease in staff and support\u2026 It saddens me when patients are just being shuffled through our health care system, and health care workers have to hustle our patients like it\u2019s a fast-food driveway.\n\n\u2013 Cindy Aban, medical assistant, Honolulu\n\n\u2666 \u2666 \u2666\n\nIt\u2019s disconcerting when I see and hear patients in here calling for help but can\u2019t be heard; when doctor\u2019s orders are delayed, due to lack of staff and cuts to staffing. Patients are forced to travel further to get care since the nearby clinic was closed.\n\n\u2013 Gerald Penaflor, lab assistant, Moanalua\n\n\u2666 \u2666 \u2666\n\nThere is also a lack of bargaining in good faith by Kaiser. They will attend bargaining, but they will not make decisions on that day\u2014and they don\u2019t have the info needed that was requested from us at the last bargaining date. And they still say they are bargaining in good faith.\n\n\u2013 Ray Bragado, surgical technician, Moanalua\n\n\u2666 \u2666 \u2666\n\nI have been on the picket lines all week. Kaiser is accusing us of \u201cpurposely blocking patients\u201d from receiving care from our facilities. We are encouraging patients to come in, not blocking them\u2026 Kaiser closed urgent care at Honolulu and is laying off workers. They\u2019re the ones blocking patients from getting the care they deserve.\n\n\u2013 Gracie Esperanza, ward clerk, Moanalua", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "https://labornotes.org/sites/dc.lndev.opa.labornotes.org/files/logo_with_slogan.png"}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe236f\"", "article_summary": "Local 5 and the National Union of Healthcare Workers are the only Kaiser unions with still-open contracts.\nWe are encouraging patients to come in, not blocking them\u2026 Kaiser closed urgent care at Honolulu and is laying off workers.\n\u2013 Alexandra BradburyWhen I first started in 2004, patient care was a lot more personal.\nMembers of UNITE HERE Local 5 walked out February 2 on a six-day strike that closed down 10 of Kaiser Permanente\u2019s 22 Hawai\u2019i clinics.\nThe national agreement between Kaiser and the coalition of unions led by the Service Employees (SEIU) expires in September."}
