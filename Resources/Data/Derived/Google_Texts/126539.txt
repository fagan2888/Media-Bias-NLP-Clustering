The Colorado State Fair’s legislative barbecue Friday night attracted more than U.S. Sen. Mark Udall and Republican gubernatorial candidate Bob Beauprez — it lured out-of-state media wanting a chance to watch Colorado’s election up close and personal.

The presence of The Washington Post, MSNBC and even Colorado news outlets that normally don’t travel to Pueblo to cover the annual dinner further cements Colorado’s status as a swing state.

The match-up between Udall and his Republican challenger, Rep. Cory Gardner, could determine which party controls the U.S. Senate after November. Gardner wasn’t at the dinner, but participated in the State Fair parade the next day.

Beauprez has already gotten plenty of help from the Republican Governors Association, from the RGA’s controversial meddling in the GOP primary to the association’s clever pool hall ad attacking Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper.

Pueblo County Commissioner Sal Pace, who received some of that national press two years ago when he ran for Congress, said among the topics he was asked about include Colorado’s switch to same-day voter registration. The mood of Colorado voters — our economy’s better but we’re still mad about guns — was also another topic.

The dinner regularly attracts lawmakers and lobbyists, other elected officials, the governor’s staff and Pueblo civil leaders.

For Beauprez, the son of a dairy farmer, going to the State Fair brings back plenty of memories. His dad Joe showed the champion steer in 1935, and father and son showed dairy cows in the 197s and 1980s.

“This is all very familiar,” Beauprez said.

When Gov. Hickenlooper had his photo taken with Rep. Lois Landgraf, R-Fountain, he popped the usual joke about he wasn’t certain whether it helped her or hurt her. “I’m running unopposed,” she said, which got a big laugh from the governor.
