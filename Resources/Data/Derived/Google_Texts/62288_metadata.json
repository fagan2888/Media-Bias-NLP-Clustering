(AP) - Painted on one wall of Pastor Nancy Butler\u2019s bedroom is a quote from the Bible: \u201cLet us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.\u201d On a wall facing her bed and painted in various colors and fonts are the names of more than 40 inspirational people, from Martin Luther King to Gandhi to Corrie ten Boom. A painting of Jesus Christ holding a sheep hangs on another wall.\n\n\u201cThis is where I\u2019m going to die,\u201d Butler said. \u201cAnd when I die, I don\u2019t want to look at an empty wall.\n\n\u201cI needed to see something inspirational. I will see all the names of the people who inspired me over the years and that\u2019s what I want to see before I leave.\u201d\n\nButler knows a thing or two about inspiration, and perseverance.\n\nButler is in a wheelchair, in the late stages of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. The progressive and fatal neurological disease attacks nerve cells and robs people of the control over their muscles even as the brain remains strong and intact.\n\nHer 100-member flock at Riverfront Family Church in Glastonbury has watched and prayed for her as the disease takes more and more of her body each week, the children asking all sorts of innocent questions: How does she get dressed each day? How does she eat?\n\nAfter her diagnosis in February 2015, she ran services and preached the weekly sermon as long as she could, eventually handing over the reins to a team of three, including her daughter, in February.\n\nBut don\u2019t look for her to raise her fists in the air and ask: \u201cWhy me?\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone suffers,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we suffer, our faith grows.\n\n\u201cWe become better, stronger people, and we know Christ better,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s through pain we become like Christ.\u201d\n\nButler, 57, said she was diagnosed with ALS a few months after she started \u201ctripping over her toes.\u201d She was first told it may be PLS, or primary lateral sclerosis, a primarily non-fatal form of the disease. But on her grandson\u2019s birthday, she learned the truth.\n\nShe calls her new home in Marlborough - known as \u201cCamp Gaga\u201d (what her grandchildren call her) - a \u201chouse that love built.\u201d She and her husband, Greg Butler, spent much of their retirement money to make life as comfortable as possible for her. The 9-acre property has ribbons of sidewalks filled with flowering shrubs where she can go in her wheelchair. SureHands, a motorized lift system, runs from the bedroom to the bathroom. There\u2019s another system in the living room. Butler has renamed the lifts \u201cthe sure hands of God.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is our retirement,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was all done so I could be comfy and happy. We have an indoor pool so I can do therapy, but I am too weak. The grandchildren and dogs love it, though.\u201d\n\nWith the inspirational names on the wall comes a bookcase filled with multiple copies of their autobiographies and books about them. Whenever someone comes to visit - friends, physical therapists or nurses - she asks them to take a copy.\n\n\u201cIt not only helps, but everyone leaves inspired,\u201d she said.\n\nButler has had her caregiver, Valerie Peters, by her side for much of the past year. When she first received the news she has ALS, the doctor gave her some advice: Anything you want to do, do it now. Do not make your husband your caregiver. And buy a good ceiling lift.\n\n\u201cReally the strength of family has gotten me through this,\u201d she said. \u201cThey go together. We take marriage very seriously. Two really did become one. I\u2019m proud of my husband. We both feel we are over our heads sometimes, but we stay committed to each other and I couldn\u2019t have done this without him.\u201d\n\nThe disease has progressed faster than doctors and the Butlers expected. Nancy Butler quickly went from a cane to a walker, and by last May she could barely walk, beginning her life in a wheelchair. Last month, she had a feeding tube inserted into her stomach and now sometimes uses a ventilator to help her breathe.\n\n\u201cThis disease is utterly dreadful on so many levels,\u201d Greg Butler said. \u201cBut there are lovely gifts embedded. We as a family have learned to cherish treasured moments. They are very expensive and have come at a high cost, but they are gifts nonetheless.\u201d\n\nShe stopped giving traditional sermons in December as her voice weakened. For the past few months she has been wheeled up to the front of her congregation where she has used a combination of short talks and pre-recorded videos of sermons she made at home the previous week. Her final sermon as lead pastor was on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cEveryone, especially the children, sees me worse and worse each week,\u201d Nancy Butler said. \u201cWe have an open conversation and talk about death. Death is part of life. It\u2019s an opportunity to teach everybody. We do not grieve as the world grieves. We believe life is eternal. This isn\u2019t the whole story.\u201d\n\nShe promises to attend her church every Sunday, noting all she \u201cneeds to stay alive is food and air.\u201d When she had the feeding tube inserted and couldn\u2019t make it during a Sunday in February, Greg used FaceTime on his smartphone so she could watch the service. She joked that she \u201cfelt like God looking in.\u201d She plans to participate in the Easter Sunday service.\n\n\u201cI felt like Jesus kept teaching right up until the end, so I will keep teaching until I can\u2019t. You can really turn suffering into a great opportunity if we see it as that. God uses our weaknesses for good,\u201d she said.\n\nNancy Butler, who grew up in Cazenovia, New York, said her life with God began at Bible camp in Cortland, New York, when she was 9. Her life philosophy came from the words of a song the campers would sing: \u201cto know Christ and then to make him known.\u201d\n\nShe said she knew she \u201cwanted to make a difference in this world\u201d and participated in missionary work as a teen.\n\n\u201cHow many people give their lives to God when they are 9? It made a big impact in my life,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter graduating from Duke University, where she majored in religion, she got a job in Washington, D.C., with a defense contractor that made missiles. She married her high school sweetheart, Greg Butler, and believed they would give their lives to God and forgo what was expected: the minivan, the two children, the house with the white picket fence. Or at least that was the plan.\n\nAfter a year of missionary work in Hong Kong, the pair ended up settling down and raising two girls. But Nancy Butler never gave up on her goal of serving Jesus. After obtaining a master\u2019s degree in divinity studies at Yale University, she looked to rented space in the atrium of the former G. Fox building in Hartford to begin her ministry\n\nUnhappy with the traditional evangelical church views of women and gays that \u201cmade me cringe,\u201d Butler wanted to create the first welcoming and affirming evangelical church in the area. The church focuses on being \u201ctheologically open minded, diverse, empowering women and affirming of LGBT people.\u201d She also founded the Association of Inclusive Evangelical Churches, whose mission is to increase the quantity and quality of inclusive evangelical churches and college fellowship groups through social networking.\n\nButler said she believed it was easier to be innovative and start something new rather than to try to turn around an older church and battle with the politics. She wanted something refreshing, something that would draw people in.\n\nHer first attempt began by hiring University of Hartford music theater students to perform skits during her services in the atrium of the G. Fox building. She had a professional sound crew and musicians to provide the inspirational music. As Greg Butler said, \u201cit was a Disney-level, multi-media extravaganza in the G. Fox building.\u201d The church lasted about four years, from 2008 to 2012, and had about 70 members at its height. They were spending $1,000 per service and \u201cit wasn\u2019t financially sustainable,\u201d Nancy Butler said.\n\n\u201cThe church didn\u2019t grow. People weren\u2019t looking for the best church in town, they just didn\u2019t go to church. So we picked Glastonbury and we actually saw our membership shrink. I discovered I was trying to create a church with a marketing and business plan. It wasn\u2019t working.\u201d\n\nThe church lost half its members and it was time to begin again in the exercise room they rent from the town at the Riverfront Community Center along the Connecticut River in Glastonbury.\n\nButler kept the same values and vision for the church but took a more hands-off approach and let a team of others help. The result is a church whose membership is growing with a \u201cchange the community, change lives\u201d attitude and promotes itself as \u201cChurch \u2026 Just Different.\u201d\n\nThe services are held Sunday mornings at 10:30 a.m. Most people coming into the building can hear the group\u2019s music through the walls of the center. Inside, strollers line the hallways and children run around playfully. Musicians play guitars, keyboards and drums.\n\nThe service is a mix of silent prayer and the boisterous singing of hymns. Part of the service is called \u201ctestimony time,\u201d when anyone in the congregation can talk about what the sermon meant to them, how Jesus and God affected their lives during the week, or whatever is on their minds.\n\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day, Butler officially turned the reins of the church over to her daughter Liza, an ordained Baptist pastor, along with co-lead pastors and church members Ben Dubow and Jen Moyer-Washington. Butler said that during some meetings of the church board, Liza will say, \u201cSorry founding pastor, you\u2019ve been out-voted.\u201d And Butler, a self-described control freak and introvert, says she\u2019s OK with that.\n\n\u201cI took the hands off the wheel and trust in God\u2019s will,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI feel very proud of the new leadership and proud of the church. I don\u2019t want to see the church drift. I didn\u2019t want it to die. I want it to thrive without me.\u201d\n\nScott Thumma, a professor of sociology of religion and doctor of ministry director at Hartford Seminary, had Butler as a student and has been impressed with her efforts as a pastor \u201ctrying to plant a nontraditional church.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe always believed the church needed to be re-invented to attract a new generation,\u201d Thumma said. \u201cShe could have taken another church and revitalized it, but she wanted to start from the beginning from the ground up and created something new and original. She wanted something more progressive in social issues while maintaining the deep commitment to the Bible along with faith and worshipping.\n\n\u201cShe wanted a church that reflected the God she experienced in daily life,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has that deeply spiritual, culturally relevant and progressive church she always wanted.\u201d\n\nChurch members have been saddened but inspired as they watched the weekly physical toll the disease has taken on their leader.\n\n\u201cWhen you are facing a fatal disease there were tears and frustration,\u201d said Cindy Martinez, a member of the church since its formation. \u201cBut it is all about how we handle the challenges. Instead of feeling sorry for herself she immersed herself into creating hero stories - people who overcame huge odds when their body, mind and soul were broken. But they did and she\u2019s studied them all.\u201d\n\nEvelyn Mantilla, who attends services with her wife and two young daughters, has been with Butler since the days at the old G. Fox building.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s brought an example of true female leadership, especially in the eyes of my daughter,\u201d Mantilla said. \u201cBeing taught about spirituality from a strong woman brings a strong example to our daughter. I can\u2019t begin to describe what that means. She\u2019s given us courage to be different and do what\u2019s right.\n\n\u201cJust watching her walk her path and maintaining her positivity is inspirational. We admire her ability to be open about the process and her condition. She leads by example.\u201d\n\nNancy Butler said she has always believed in \u201ctaking up the cross\u201d and following Jesus. She believes God always has a plan even if it\u2019s \u201cin a very strange way.\u201d If she got the disease earlier, Butler said, she never would have been able to start her new church and see it grow. She believes ALS has only intensified her faith.\n\n\u201cThrough all the struggles, we got it right. God took it and did something with it,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted my life to count and make a difference and to make Christ known.\u201d\n\nThumma, who as a young man watched an uncle fight ALS and try to make sense of it, said that while there is some of that in Butler, she has \u201caccepted her fate with faith and Godly peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the ultimate Easter story,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s able to express love and joy through her suffering. \u2026 She\u2019s an inspiration for all of us facing mortality. The bitter irony of it is just as she gets the dream of her life going and standing on its own, she\u2019s no longer able to stand on her own. But she has handled it with grace and dignity.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Hartford Courant, http://www.courant.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Painted on one wall of Pastor Nancy Butler's bedroom is a quote from the Bible: \"Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us.\" On a wall facing her bed and painted in various colors and fonts are the names of more than 40 inspirational people, from Martin Luther King to Gandhi to Corrie ten Boom.
