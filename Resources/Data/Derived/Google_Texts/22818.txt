RIO DE JANEIRO — Angel Di Maria will not start for Argentina in the World Cup final against Germany after struggling with a thigh injury.

Di Maria also missed the semifinal win over the Netherlands, and the speedy winger’s absence is a big blow for Argentina’s attack.

Germany starts with the same lineup that beat Brazil 7-1 in the semifinals after center back Mats Hummels was declared fit despite a minor knee problem.

Lionel Messi spearheads Argentina’s attack alongside Gonzalo Higuain, with Sergio Aguero on the bench. Aguero has also struggled with a thigh injury. Argentina also stayed with the same lineup that started in the semifinals.

Lineups:

Germany: Manuel Neuer; Philipp Lahm, Mats Hummels, Jerome Boateng, Benedikt Hoewedes; Sami Khedira, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Toni Kroos, Mesut Ozil, Thomas Mueller; Miroslav Klose.

Argentina: Sergio Romero; Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis, Ezequiel Garay, Marcos Rojo; Lucas Biglia, Javier Mascherano, Enzo Perez; Ezequiel Lavezzi, Gonzalo Higuain, Lionel Messi.
