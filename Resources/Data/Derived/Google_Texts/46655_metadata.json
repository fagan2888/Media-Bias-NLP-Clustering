More people are insured, but deductibles are higher,\u201d Ron O\u2019Halloran, Temporary Administrator, North Valley Hospital\n\nO\u2019Halloran discusses changes to healthcare in ACA\n\nTONASKET \u2013 Clarice Nelson, reporting for the Long Range Focus committee at the April 9 North Valley Hospital Board of Commissioners meeting said five Skype interviews of hospital administrator candidates were scheduled for the end of March, but two of the candidates had taken other jobs already.\n\nThe first Skype interview was done last week, and two candidates were scheduled to be interviewed Tuesday, April 14. One of them was a \u201cno-show\u201d according to Nelson, and the other one is no longer in the running after being interviewed. An interview with a third candidate is intended to be set up for next week. The on-campus interviews have been postponed, and the linked-in ad for the new administrator will be expanded for another 30 days.\n\nMeanwhile, Ron O\u2019Halloran began serving as interim hospital administrator April 1, and is dedicated to holding the helm as long as necessary.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had fun trying to meet the staff and greet the community as I go around,\u201d O\u2019Halloran said at the board meeting. \u201cI\u2019m pleased with staff and their commitment to the community, which takes us a long way to meet the goals of the strategic plan. While I am here, we will get out into the community. If you have a service organization and want us to come and talk, let us know.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Halloran said it is important for people to understand what is going on with changes in healthcare through the Affordable Care Act/Obama Care.\n\n\u201cIt is changing reimbursement structure through the state. More people are insured, but deductibles are higher,\u201d O\u2019Halloran said.\n\nBoard Chair Helen Casey reported that \u201cThe ICD10 (Insurance Diagnostic Codes manual) is coming and will change lives forever\u2014how we bill, how we treat people. There\u2019s an awful lot to go along with that in prep work. Doctors would like to be doctors and not have to deal with that.\u201d\n\nAccording to O\u2019Halloran, the ICD regulates how doctors and nurses chart what they learn from the patient, how they envision care for the patient and how they carry that out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all dictated and documented,\u201d O\u2019Halloran said, \u201cacuity of care codes for service a patient receives. Each digit on the hand has a code and how it relates to the wrist, elbow and shoulder; it all has a code and that is how you get reimbursed.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Halloran said there were thousands of codes, all related to the healthcare plan the physician has ordered, how it\u2019s carried out, and how the patient responds. He said the ICD9 had been \u201cout there for years, and they\u2019ve added tens of thousands of more codes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shocking what has to be done to get reimbursed. If they don\u2019t get every detail of care down, they don\u2019t get a payment. If you use the wrong codes, there are penalties for that.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Halloran said the coding was very difficult, particularly for older doctors who found it overwhelming.\n\n\u201cThey are saying, \u2018Just let me be a doctor.\u2019 The younger ones do much better. Because of smart devices, if you follow the algorithms, codes come up automatically in place. Newer doctors are getting this as part of their training, whereas other ones have to pick it up,\u201d said O\u2019Halloran. \u201cIt\u2019s all evolving.\u201d\n\nCasey asked staff to review the 2013/14 Strategic Plan to recognize goals met and others that still needed to be addressed.\n\n\u201cSome goals we can cross off and say \u2018good job,\u2019 others we still need to focus on,\u201d Casey said, adding, \u201cWe haven\u2019t done the education we need; we\u2019ve been more reactive than proactive.\u201d\n\nAccording to O\u2019Halloran, Casey was referring to staff time and energy being funneled into financial concerns.\n\n\u201cI think because of budget constraints they have been fighting through, they have forgone themselves the opportunity to go to classes sponsored by the hospital association, vendors and state agencies to keep themselves informed of the opportunity to affect positive change. It is important for board and staff to take advantage of continuing education,\u201d said O\u2019Halloran. \u201cWe need to put enough money into the budget so they can seek other certifications to improve their ability to come back and serve the community.\u201d\n\nAs an example, O\u2019Halloran said the hospital has a dietician who is not certified in diabetic education.\n\n\u201cWe like to think we could help her achieve that,\u201d said O\u2019Halloran. \u201cSometimes an extra help can set someone up to achieve that extra level of ability to serve the community.\u201d\n\nNVH holds a Diabetes Support Group meeting the first Tuesday of every month in the hospital board room. The cost-free meeting, facilitated by R.N. Phil Gleason, runs from 5:30 to 7 p.m. and pre-registration is not necessary.\n\nQuality reports from employees at each board meeting continued with Radiology Manager Shane Pyper reporting on imaging.\n\nPyper reported the new Optima 660 CT scanner was \u201cdoing great and the patients love it. We\u2019ve done almost 500 scans this year so far, and this week we\u2019ve already done 40 scans. It\u2019s been a busy week.\u201d\n\nPyper attributes steady business of the scanner to healthcare using \u201cmore diagnostic scans nowadays.\u201d He said approximately 80 million scans were done in the United States in 2014, 1683 of those done at NVH.\n\nWith the increase in CT scans, several states have passed legislation requiring tracking of radiation doses per patient. Washington is not yet one of those states.\n\n\u201cWe are now asking patients if they\u2019ve had one done recently, and we pull up their records and track their dose,\u201d Pyper said, adding that repeated CT scans happen for cancer or oncology patients, or patients who \u201cdon\u2019t get the answer they want, so they go somewhere else and rescan.\u201d\n\nPyper said another example might be someone with ongoing migraine headaches who comes in, and if they see a new doctor he might not know the patient just had a head scan done a couple weeks ago.\n\n\u201cA lot of patients don\u2019t realize it (radiation) adds up over time,\u201d Pyper said, adding that if Washington state passed legislation requiring radiation doses to be monitored, \u201cOur scanner is set up and ready to go. It would just be a matter of implementing the tracking.\u201d\n\nThe Optima 660 has Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction, ASIR, which allows lower dose scanning. The ASIR software corrects it to still have a high-quality image, according to Pyper.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to use up to 40% ASIR dose reduction,\u201d Pyper said. The scanner is calibrated daily, and monitored yearly by a physicist.\n\n\u201cIf the numbers started to stray, we would call in a service technician, and if they couldn\u2019t fix it we would call in a physicist,\u201d said Pyper.\n\nPyper said one year of natural radiation is about three millisieverts of radiation, and a chest Xray equaled about seven millisieverts. A CT scan is equal to about 200 chest Xrays, according to Pyper.\n\nFor Board Member Committee reports, Herb Wandler said his favorite item to comment on \u201cis finance, as it keeps improving. When I look back at the Strategic Plan of 2013/14, we were not in good shape. We have made great progress,\u201d said Wandler, adding that regarding Caribou Trail Orthopedics, Mid Valley Hospital was still struggling to pay their warrants.\n\nNVH had $1,518,422 cash on hand as of April 9.\n\n\u201cIt would be good to have 90 days cash on hand,\u201d said Casey. \u201cWe\u2019re not quite there, but we\u2019ve done well.\u201d\n\nAccording to O\u2019Halloran, the hospital is about a quarter of the way to having 90 days cash on hand.\n\nTheresa Hughes said the Nursing Home Success Team put on a couple of good pubic forums, and would be looking at what to do next.\n\n\u201cThey want to do another one of the forums here in Tonasket,\u201d said O\u2019Halloran. \u201cWe had a great turnout in Oroville and would like to see that happen here as well.\u201d\n\nCasey reported the hospital\u2019s Wellness Programs have been well-received by the people participating in them. The next course will be Thursday, April 16 from 6:00 to 7:00 p.m. OT R/L John D. Ehlers will present a course on Occupational Therapy focusing on what a person can do to improve and extend functional safety and independence within their personal residence. The cost is free, but people are asked to register ahead of time.\n\n\u201cIt is changing reimbursement structure through the state. More people are insured, but deductibles are higher,\u201d O\u2019Halloran said.\u201cIt is changing reimbursement structure through the state.
