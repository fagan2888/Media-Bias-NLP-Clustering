We\u2019ve been tested.\u201d\n\nIn response to an audience member asking how he has changed since his previous campaign, Santorum answered:\n\n\u201cGoing through the experience campaigning in 30 states is a tremendous experience. You run a campaign and you realize that the best thing to do in your campaign is to quit worrying about everybody else, quit trying to be on the attack mode all the time.\u201d\n\nHe continued:\n\nFor me, this is a race where I\u2019m going to step back, not worry about anybody else and just try to be who I am. I\u2019m not running against anybody this time. I\u2019m running for something. I\u2019m trying to run for America.\n\nClaiming Hardin County as the 29th county he has visited in Iowa this year, Santorum had more town-hall style meetings planned in the state throughout the day.", "article_metadata": {"description": "During a campaign stop at a coffee shop today, Rick Santorum worked to recapture the Iowa magic that helped spark his surprise run for president in 2012.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "During a campaign stop at a coffee shop today, Rick Santorum worked to recapture the Iowa magic that helped spark his surprise run for president in 2012.", "title": "Over Coffee, Rick Santorum Tries to Recapture Iowa Success", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Santorum.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-10T18:36:21+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1B49vUB"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "During a campaign stop at a coffee shop today, Rick Santorum worked to recapture the Iowa magic that helped spark his surprise run for president in 2012.", "title": "Over Coffee, Rick Santorum Tries to Recapture Iowa Success", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/Santorum.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Politics", "tag": 2016, "published_time": "2015-06-09T19:48:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-10T18:36:21+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Rick Santorum, election, 2016, Iowa, politics, Hardin County"}, "article_summary": "IOWA FALLS, Iowa\u2014During a campaign stop at a coffee shop Tuesday morning, Rick Santorum worked to recapture the Iowa success that helped spark his run for president in 2012.\nAt the coffee shop in Hardin County, Iowa, as locals enjoyed their morning cup of joe, the former Pennsylvania senator spoke on national security, the economy and what makes him different from other 2016 presidential candidates.\nI\u2019m trying to run for America.\nClaiming Hardin County as the 29th county he has visited in Iowa this year, Santorum had more town-hall style meetings planned in the state throughout the day.\nWe\u2019ve been tested.\u201dIn response to an audience member asking how he has changed since his previous campaign, Santorum answered:\u201cGoing through the experience campaigning in 30 states is a tremendous experience."}
