Oklahomans walked for heat health Saturday in downtown Tulsa. The annual Tulsa Heart Walk started at 8 a.m. at ONEOK Field with more than 8,000 walkers taking part.

The event raised more than $900,000 for research and health initiatives, according to Lindsey Hansen of the American Heart Association.

The non-competitive 5K walk had many participants on four legs as the Heart Association welcomed dogs at no extra charge.
