For the second time, President Barack Obama has likened a government issue to gaming. Looking to quell some worry over the Affordable Care Act, the difficulties many have experienced when registering for health insurance through the marketplace, the President explained, "Unlike the day after Thanksgiving sales for the latest PlayStation or flat screen TVs, the insurance plans don't run out."

"They're not going to sell out," the President said. "They'll be available through the marketplace throughout the open enrollment period. The prices that insurer's have set will not change. So everybody who wants insurance through the marketplace will get insurance. Period."

The same can't be said of the PS4, or even the Xbox One for that matter; both are currently sold out for launch at many retailers including Gamestop, the largest video game retailer in the United States. Of course, both next-gen consoles will eventually be in stock again, and likely for the same price as Thanksgiving/Holiday sales won't really apply to the brand new consoles anyway. So if you haven't pre-ordered the Xbox One or PS4, and haven't been able to register for health insurance, it seems all you can do is wait.

The mention comes not long after the President dropped an Xbox reference when speaking about the Government shutdown.

"The American people do not get to demand a ransom for doing their jobs," he said earlier this month. "You don't get a chance to call your bank and say, 'I'm not going to pay my mortgage this month unless you throw in a new car and an Xbox.'"

A free Xbox for paying my mortgage sure does sound nice though.
