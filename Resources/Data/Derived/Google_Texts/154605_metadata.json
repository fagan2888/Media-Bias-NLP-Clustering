But his campaign struggled to respond when a prominent Republican district chairman kicked off the rally with an anti-Semitic joke.\n\nJohn Whitbeck, the chairman of Virginia\u2019s 10th Congressional District Republican Committee, started the event by noting that he is a Catholic and that those in his faith recently celebrated the new Pope. He told a lengthy joke about a tradition in which the \u201chead of the Jewish faith goes to the Vatican and brings a ceremonial piece of paper\u201d to the new Pontiff:\n\nWHITBECK: This time around, the Pope says, \u201cI gotta find out what\u2019s on this piece of paper.\u201d So he actually takes it from the head of the Jewish faith, he opens it, he looks at, he closes it, he grimaces. And his Jewish counterpart says, \u201cWhat what is?\u201d And he says, \u201cWell, that was the bill from the Last Supper.\u201d So, on that note, we\u2019re waiting for Ken Cuccinelli and he\u2019s on his way.\n\nWatch the video:\n\nWhile Cuccinelli was not present to hear Whitbeck\u2019s remarks, his did not denounce the joke in his speech nor immediately afterward.\n\nCuccinelli campaign strategist Chris LaCivita, who handled media strategy for the infamous Swift Boat Veterans for Truth in 2004, tried to distance the campaign from its supporter. \u201cI don\u2019t even know who the guy is,\u201d he told the Washington Post. \u201cIt\u2019s wholly inappropriate and not connected to the campaign. And it\u2019s not reflective of Ken Cuccinelli.\u201d\n\nBut in May, an activist tweeted a photo of Whitbeck, giving one of the nomination speeches for Cuccinelli at the state Republican convention. Whitbeck\u2019s own Twitter feed and the 10th District Committee\u2019s Facebook page show him with Cuccinelli at numerous campaign events. And, as Ben Tribbett noted on his Not Larry Sabato blog, Cuccinelli\u2019s political director worked closely with Whitbeck to win the 10th district committee elections in 2012 in order to take over the Republican State Central Committee \u2014 a key component of his strategy to change the nomination process in Cuccinelli\u2019s favor.\n\nAmazingly, the Cuccinelli campaign also posted the Post article \u2014 noting the Whitbeck comment \u2014 on its campaign news page.\n\nThe Jewish Daily Forward slammed Whitbeck for combining \u201ctwo of the most toxic anti-Jewish stereotypes into a single punchline: God-killers [and] Cheapskates.\u201d Also, Whitbeck demonstrates a stunning ignorance of Judaism in suggesting that there is a Pope-like \u201chead of the Jewish faith.\u201d There is not.\n\nThe Cuccinelli campaign did not respond to a ThinkProgress request for additional comment.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Ken Cuccinelli's campaign struggled to respond when a prominent Republican district chairman kicked off a campaign rally with an anti-Semitic joke.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Ken Cuccinelli's campaign struggled to respond when a prominent Republican district chairman kicked off a campaign rally with an anti-Semitic joke.", "title": "Cuccinelli Closely Linked To Party Chairman Who Made Anti-Semitic Joke At His Rally", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2013/09/18/2640571/cuccinelli-anti-semitic-joke/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CuccinelliWhitbeck3x2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ken Cuccinelli's campaign struggled to respond when a prominent Republican district chairman kicked off a campaign rally with an anti-Semitic joke.", "creator": "@jeisrael", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CuccinelliWhitbeck3x2-321x214.jpg", "title": "Cuccinelli Closely Linked To Party Chairman Who Made Anti-Semitic Joke At His Rally", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-justice", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CuccinelliWhitbeck3x2.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/CuccinelliWhitbeck3x2.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-18T11:35:45+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joshisraelinvestigates"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc2eb\"", "article_summary": "But his campaign struggled to respond when a prominent Republican district chairman kicked off the rally with an anti-Semitic joke.\nJustice Cuccinelli Closely Linked To Party Chairman Who Made Anti-Semitic Joke At His Rally CREDIT:John Whitbeck and Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli (R-VA)Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II (R) hosted a \u201cConstitution Day\u201d rally with right-wing shock jock Mark Levin on Tuesday, in support of his campaign to be Virginia\u2019s next governor.\nThe Cuccinelli campaign did not respond to a ThinkProgress request for additional comment.\nAmazingly, the Cuccinelli campaign also posted the Post article \u2014 noting the Whitbeck comment \u2014 on its campaign news page.\nCuccinelli campaign strategist Chris LaCivita, who handled media strategy for the infamous Swift Boat Veterans for Truth in 2004, tried to distance the campaign from its supporter."}
