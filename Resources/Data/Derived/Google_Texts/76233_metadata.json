Hospital care is the most expensive. Nursing and skilled nursing facilities are less so, but still costly. Both can be impersonal.\n\nLast year, federal auditors found that 33 percent of skilled nursing facility patients were infected or injured because of lack of care. They were taken to a hospital, where the average bill was more than $10,000.\n\nThe more affordable option can be hospice care.\n\nWhen it becomes apparent to a doctor that the patient has a terminal condition, Medicare encourages the medical community and families to move the patient to hospice care.\n\nIt can be delivered in a nursing home or an assisted-living facility. Many times, it gives people an opportunity most of us want \u2014 to die at home.\n\nUnlike hospitals and nursing homes, hospice care givers don\u2019t have much oversight for safe practices. The standards they are required to meet aren\u2019t made public, either.\n\nThe price is lower than for hospital or nursing home stays. Medicare pays an average of about $150 a day until the patient reaches a crisis and needs constant care. At that point, the pay goes to roughly $881 a day.\n\nHospice care companies must be licensed to get paid by Medicare. But there are fewer checks on their practices than there are on other types of care.\n\nHospice care is paid for on a daily basis, no matter the amount of services delivered.\n\nIn a report released last week, federal auditors found that hospices treating patients in assisted living facilities were getting as much as $1,100 a week for less than five hours of care.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act directed federal health officials to come up with a different hospice reimbursement method. It also requires a tighter safety and quality regime, and a way to make that available to the public.\n\nHospital and nursing home quality can be checked on Medicare websites (medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/search.html and medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/search.html). Hospice care ratings aren\u2019t there yet.\n\nLast week\u2019s report on hospice at assisted-living facilities was written by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\n\u201cWe found that Medicare paid a lot more money for hospice care provided in assisted-living facilities, compared to hospice care provided in other settings like private homes or nursing facilities,\u201d said Jenell Clarke-Whyte, a team leader for the OIG Office of Evaluation and Inspections.\n\nOnce a doctor says a patient probably has less than six months to live, Medicare pays for hospice care for two 90-day periods and will keep paying in 60-day increments as warranted.\n\nThe OIG found that, in 2012, hospice patients in assisted-living facilities were under hospice care an average of 98 days. The average for a hospice patient receiving care at home was 45 days.\n\nBecause of the longer stays, the cost of hospice care soared. Between 2007 and 2012, Medicare\u2019s spending for hospice at assisted-living facilities increased from less than $1 billion to $2.1 billion.\n\nAlso disturbing to the auditors was the type of care delivered in assisted-living facilities.\n\n\u201cSome hospice providers are targeting certain beneficiaries with medically uncomplicated conditions because they may offer hospices the greatest financial gain,\u201d Clarke-Whyte said.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nChange the payment system from a daily rate to paying for what\u2019s actually done. And rate hospice care givers publicly on such measures as their willingness to deliver care on weekends, Clarke-Whyte said.\n\nFollow Jim Landers on Twitter at @landersjim.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The system under which Medicare pays for hospice care needs to change, and rating standards need to be imposed, an official says.", "og": {"description": "The system under which Medicare pays for hospice care needs to change, and rating standards need to be imposed, an official says.", "title": "Landers: Hospice care in need of stricter oversight, auditors say", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20150119-landers-hospice-care-in-need-of-stricter-oversight-auditors-say.ece", "image": {"width": 345, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "height": 345}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-01-20T03:43:11Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2015-01-20T03:24:06Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Landers: Hospice care in need of stricter oversight, auditors say\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/columnists/jim-landers/20150119-landers-hospice-care-in-need-of-stricter-oversight-auditors-say.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2143240\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-20T03:24:06Z\", \"section\": \"Jim Landers\", \"author\": \"Jim Landers\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/resrsc/images/facebook-default.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-01-20T03:24:06Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "And rate hospice care givers publicly on such measures as their willingness to deliver care on weekends, Clarke-Whyte said.\nThe OIG found that, in 2012, hospice patients in assisted-living facilities were under hospice care an average of 98 days.\nUnlike hospitals and nursing homes, hospice care givers don\u2019t have much oversight for safe practices.\nThe more affordable option can be hospice care.\nHospice care is paid for on a daily basis, no matter the amount of services delivered."}
