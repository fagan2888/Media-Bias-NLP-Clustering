Isn\u2019t this just so much inside baseball, you know, media droning on about media?\n\nI can answer that.\n\nHe protected us.\n\nOPINION\n\nFollow @CarolMarin\n\nAll of us.\n\nLiberals, moderates, conservatives, libertarians, citizens, politicians, reporters. And always, first and foremost, readers.\n\nSteve was my first boss at the Chicago Sun-Times back when the publisher and executive editor, John Cruickshank and Michael Cooke, foisted me upon him in 2004 to fill the space on the editorial page once occupied by legendary political columnist Steve Neal.\n\nAt the time, the paper was reeling from Neal\u2019s suicide and from the aftershocks of the federal fraud investigation of our felonious owner/chairman, Conrad Black, and his henchman, David Radler.\n\nAnd then I arrived. A longtime television reporter suddenly thrust into a print newsroom, I braced myself for pushback. Print has always seen itself as hallowed space \u2014 the high church of journalism \u2014 and historically viewed television types as blown-dry hairdos with not much under the hair.\n\nBut Steve Huntley, a languid Southern gentleman, warmly welcomed me on my first day 11 years ago. What, he inquired, was I planning to write? And how soon would I be ready to file?\n\nAs editor of the editorial page back then, he could easily have tried to steer my columns in one direction or another.\n\nHe never did.\n\nNot once.\n\nMoreover, when I would explain the position I was taking \u2014 on the mayor, the Catholic Church, the state Legislature \u2014 he gave no sign of agreement or disagreement. He cared only about facts and fairness.\n\nLike my columnist colleague, Mark Brown, I was shocked to discover when Steve become a columnist that he had truckloads of opinions.\n\n\u201cI am always most struck,\u201d wrote Mark in an email, \u201cby Steve being such a consummate journalism professional that most of us didn\u2019t have an inkling of the depth of his conservative views until he started writing his column.\u201d\n\nTough on Obamacare, an abiding supporter of Israel, and no friend of Hillary, Steve offered a full range of conservative views that were eloquently argued and written. While I admit he and I often see the world from different perspectives, it is a respectful disagreement.\n\nRespect is what Steve offered every day in the newsroom to colleagues and to readers.\n\nWhile some people in our business are larger than life, imposing and self-promoting, he is the opposite. What he promoted for the all the years he was our editor was the news.\n\nAnd, on the opinion pages, the free and unfettered exchange of views.\n\nIt is a lucky ink-stained wretch who can brag that he or she once worked for Steve Huntley. Because every one of us knows he made us better than we otherwise might have been.\n\nThank you, boss.\n\nEmail: cmarin@suntimes.com\n\nFollow Carol Marin on Twitter: Follow @CarolMarin", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarolMarin\">Follow @CarolMarin</a></p>", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/carol-marin-thanks-steve-huntley-for-your-grace-and-skills/", "site": "@suntimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Carol Marin: Thanks, Steve Huntley, for your grace and skills"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282828", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "Chicago News, Sports, Politics, Entertainment, Weather and More", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://chicago.suntimes.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "og": {"url": "http://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/carol-marin-thanks-steve-huntley-for-your-grace-and-skills/", "type": "article", "site_name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "title": "Carol Marin: Thanks, Steve Huntley, for your grace and skills"}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "Chicago Sun-Times", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/chicagosuntimes/assets/images/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda4df\"", "article_summary": "Carol Marin: Thanks, Steve Huntley, for your grace and skillsFollow @CarolMarinSteve Huntley operates with an unassuming grace.\nIt is a lucky ink-stained wretch who can brag that he or she once worked for Steve Huntley.\nBut Steve Huntley, a languid Southern gentleman, warmly welcomed me on my first day 11 years ago.\nLike my columnist colleague, Mark Brown, I was shocked to discover when Steve become a columnist that he had truckloads of opinions.\nAs editor of the editorial page back then, he could easily have tried to steer my columns in one direction or another."}
