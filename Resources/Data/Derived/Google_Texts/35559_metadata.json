One challenge facing consumers will be wide swings in prices. Some insurers are seeking double-digit price increases\u2026\n\nThe top executive for H&R Block, the nation\u2019s largest tax preparer, on Wednesday said he expected President Obama\u2019s health care law to add \u201csignificant complexity\u201d to next year\u2019s tax season...\u201cAs expected, the forms are very detailed and can present significant complexity, depending on a filer\u2019s coverage status during the year, income level, and household composition,\u201d Cobb said. \u201cDepending on their situation, there are instances where filers may need to file multiple new tax forms and complete additional worksheets.\u201d Starting with next year\u2019s tax season, individuals who do not have health insurance that meets federal requirements will be subject to penalties. But there are various categories of individuals who could be exempted. \u201cDepending on the type of exemption, the process to claim it could be quite cumbersome and time consuming,\u201d Cobb said.\n\nSmall, rural hospitals like Linden have always struggled to remain viable, but things are getting worse, fast. Rural communities are shrinking at a time when healthcare providers are being pressured to cut costs and release patients sooner. Twenty-four rural hospitals have closed across the country since the start of 2013, double the pace of the previous 20 months, according to the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program\u2026.Now the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare, is bringing additional pressure. Obamacare is designed to fold the poor and uninsured into the healthcare system, but changes in how the federal government pays for the disadvantaged are already pressuring the hospitals that cater to them, such as rural ones.\n\n\n\n(5) Thanks, taxpayers. Please enjoy the unironic use of \"unlikely:\"\n\nWith an $8 billion tax on insurers due Sept. 30 \u2014 the first time the new tax is being collected \u2014 the industry is getting help from an unlikely source: taxpayers. States and the federal government will spend at least $700 million this year to pay the tax for their Medicaid health plans. The three dozen states that use Medicaid managed care plans will give those insurers more money to cover the new expense. Many of those states \u2013 such as Florida, Louisiana and Tennessee \u2013 did not expand Medicaid as the law allows, and in the process turned down billions in new federal dollars. Other insurers are getting some help paying the tax as well. Private insurers are passing the tax onto policyholders in the form of higher premiums. Medicare health plans are getting the tax covered by the federal government via higher reimbursement.\n\n(7) The federal health spending \"cost curve\" continues to point up, not down (as promised), as health spending increases, via the government's own actuaries:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe combined effects of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s coverage expansions, faster economic growth, and population aging are expected to fuel health spending growth this year and thereafter (5.6 percent in 2014 and 6.0 percent per year for 2015\u201323)...Because health spending is projected to grow 1.1 percentage points faster than the average economic growth during 2013\u201323, the health share of the gross domestic product is expected to rise from 17.2 percent in 2012 to 19.3 percent in 2023.\n\nLast month, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York published two surveys of regional employers\u2014one focused on manufacturing businesses, one on service companies\u2014and asked them how Obamacare was affecting their businesses. For 2015, 33.3 percent of service firms said Obamacare was increasing their costs \u201ca lot,\u201d whereas 51.2 percent of manufacturing firms said the same. While almost no firms said they would be dropping health coverage for their workers, 16.9 percent of service firms and 21.6 percent of manufacturers said they would be reducing their workforce due to Obamacare. 21.8 and 20.5 percent, respectively, said they would be reducing wage and salary compensation. 25 and 36.4 percent, respectively, said they would be raising prices for their customers.\n\n\n\nAvik Roy spells out the three primary ways in which the \"Affordable\" Care Act acts as a wet blanket on the US job market: (a) Obamacare is one of the largest tax increases in U.S. history; (b) Obamacare increases the cost of employing workers; (c) Obamacare\u2019s exchange subsidies encourage many workers to drop out.
