General Assembly Wednesday evening.\n\nGovernor Pat McCrory listed new initiatives for North Carolina in his State of the State address at the N.C. General Assembly Wednesday night.\n\nIn his second State of the State since being sworn in as governor in 2013, McCrory touched on a range of topics\u2014including the economy, education, healthcare and transportation and infrastructure. He both highlighted his accomplishments as governor and laid out his plan for North Carolina\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cDespite this tremendous accomplishment, there are still a lot of communities, small businesses and individuals that are hurting,\" McCrory said. \"There is still much work to be done.\u201d\n\nThe State of the State address is given by the governor every other year.\n\n\n\nMcCrory was vocal about the topic of health care reform, an issue that is prominent in both state and national dialogues. He said that he would work with state legislators to develop a North Carolina plan for Medicaid expansion in the coming year.\n\nMcCrory recommended a North Carolina plan that would expand the Medicaid program, which provides health insurance for those below the poverty line. Under McCrory's proposal, the state would obtain a waiver from the federal government which would allow it to bypass some of the expansion requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act while still receiving funding from the federal government.\n\n\u201cI will only recommend a North Carolina plan, not a Washington plan, so we can put patients first,\u201d McCrory said.\n\nDemocratic legislators expressed cautious support for the governor's Medicaid expansion plan. Democratic Representative Tricia Cotham acknowledged that McCrory had to be mindful of political concerns within his own party.\n\n\u201cHe [McCrory] gently from a political standpoint took a step in the right direction,\u201d she said.\n\nMcCrory noted that Medicaid was a hotly contested issue in the last legislative session.\n\n\u201cLast session, we came close to passing Medicaid reform, but progress stalled on the one-yard-line. Let\u2019s not take another pass this year,\u201d he said.\n\nAlso on the topic of health and safety, McCrory highlighted state efforts to combat drug addiction. He specifically highlighted the Let's Talk It Out underage drinking advertising campaign currently being run by the state.\n\n\u201cThese ads about underage drinking hit you at the heart,\u201d he said.\n\nMcCrory\u2019s rhetoric about health and wellness as it relates to youth and veterans also appealed to Cotham.\n\n\u201cAs a former high school principal, I was really glad to hear talk about underage drinking and drug abuse.\u201d she said\n\nMcCrory additionally discussed how health and wellness issues relate to veterans\u2019 affairs, placing a big emphasis on programs to aid veterans as they re-enter to civillian life. He announced plans to expand the Veterans Treatment Courts program, which could be expanding into Durham.\n\nOn the topic of courts, McCrory announced several efforts to reform the criminal justice system in an attempt to improve retention of correction officers. Initiatives he discussed included implementing intelligence-based crime prevention initiatives and efforts to reduce drug use and gang membership in prisons.\n\nMcCrory announced several other new initiatives\u2014including structural reforms to oversight of worker\u2019s compensation claims, the NC Competes job program, a historic preservation tax credit and a plan to raise teacher base pay to $35,000 per year.\n\nDespite all the new initiatives he announced, McCrory acknowledged the budget strain that North Carolina still faces, even in the years since the recession. McCrory noted that entitlements like pensions are still a major expenditure.\n\n\u201cAll of our challenges and initiatives will require money and resources\u2014like last session, money will be tight,\" he said. \u201cMuch of our budget is already obligated as we sit down to write the budget in the coming weeks.\u201d\n\nLeah Abrams, a high school junior from Carrboro and state senate page who attended the speech, said she enjoyed listening to the governor talk about the economic plans for North Carolina\u2019s future. However, she also expressed concern that McCrory didn't cover some important issues in his speech.\n\n\n\n\u201cI wish there was more on Medicare, women\u2019s rights and unfreezing teacher pay,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://ds4q8c259towh.cloudfront.net/20160415XJlq9-dXcb/dist/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "description": "The Chronicle is Duke University's independent student newspaper where you can find campus news, Blue Devil sports coverage, features, opinions and breaking news online and in print four days a week.", "generator": "Gryphon 20160217001 (Foundry 6.1-20150615001)", "og": {"site_name": "The Chronicle", "description": "The Chronicle is Duke University's independent student newspaper where you can find campus news, Blue Devil sports coverage, features, opinions and breaking news online and in print four days a week.", "title": "McCrory offers \u2018North Carolina plan\u2019 in State of State address", "url": "http://www.dukechronicle.com/article/2015/02/mccrory-offers-north-carolina-plan-state-state-address", "image": "http://ds4q8c259towh.cloudfront.net/20160415XJlq9-dXcb/dist/img/dtc-ph.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@DukeChronicle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TheChronicle", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://ds4q8c259towh.cloudfront.net/20160415XJlq9-dXcb/dist/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "TheChronicle", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9aed\"", "article_summary": "McCrory offers \u2018North Carolina plan\u2019 in State of State addressBy Sarah Kerman | Thursday, February 5 2015Photo by Anthony Alvernaz | The Chronicle Governor Pat McCrory, presented his annual State of the State address at the N.C.
