The rule sets parameters for how long hospital visits can be before becoming inpatient stays. Critics have said the \u201ctwo midnights\u201d benchmark is too rigid. The SGR bill would delay the rule for six months\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-KY, promised quick action on the bill when the Senate returned the week of April 13.\n\n[Also: SGR bill delays 'two midnight' rule]\n\nHowever, the deadline for the last \u201cdoc fix\u201d on SGR expired April 1, which meant the 21 percent pay cut to physicians would take effect at that time.\n\nCMS will delay processing claims, but said any delay after April 15 would negatively affect providers\u2019 cash flow.\n\n\u201cBecause we have an obligation to make sure that physicians are paid for services furnished, starting on April 15, we will begin to process claims at the 21-percent lower payment rate if the law is not changed,\u201d CMS said in its notice. Should Congress act after April 15, CMS would reprocess those claims paid at the lower payment rate to reflect the new payment rates, it said.\n\nThe bill , H.R. 2, repeals the automatic Medicare payment cuts to doctors and was overwhelmingly passed the House on March 28.\n\nTwitter: @SusanMorseHFN", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/cms-cut-medicare-rates-after-april-15-sgr-bill-not-approved", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/group-of-doctors-feature.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "The agency is also briefly delaying enforcement of the 'two midnight rule' until Senators have a chance to vote on the bill.", "title": "CMS to cut Medicare rates after April 15 is SGR bill not approved"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/group-of-doctors-feature.gif"}, "description": "The agency is also briefly delaying enforcement of the 'two midnight rule' until Senators have a chance to vote on the bill.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CMS to cut Medicare rates after April 15 is SGR bill not approved"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Starting April 15, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said it will begin reducing physician payment for Medicare claims by 21 percent, the rate mandated under the sustainable growth rate, if legislation is not passed.&#13; The reduced payment will be retroactive to claims received on or after April 1, according to the notice.&#13; [Also: House passes SGR bill by huge margin]", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab7e\"", "article_summary": "2, repeals the automatic Medicare payment cuts to doctors and was overwhelmingly passed the House on March 28.\nIn addition to the rate delay, CMS said it is pushing back enforcement of the \u201ctwo midnight rule\u201d for 30 days.\nShould Congress act after April 15, CMS would reprocess those claims paid at the lower payment rate to reflect the new payment rates, it said.\n[Also: SGR bill delays 'two midnight' rule]However, the deadline for the last \u201cdoc fix\u201d on SGR expired April 1, which meant the 21 percent pay cut to physicians would take effect at that time.\nCMS will delay processing claims, but said any delay after April 15 would negatively affect providers\u2019 cash flow."}
