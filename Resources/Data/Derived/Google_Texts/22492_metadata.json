Mike Rogers, Mo Brooks, Martha Roby, Bradley Byrne, Robert Aderholt and Gary Palmer all signed the two-page letter. Sens. Jeff Sessions and Richard Shelby were among the Senators supporting the earlier Senate efforts.\n\nThe House letter is different: instead of addressing it to Iran's leaders, the Congressmen have sent it sent it directly to the president. The message is the same, however.\n\n\"A final comprehensive nuclear agreement must constrain Iran's nuclear infrastructure so that Iran has no pathway to a bomb and that agreement must be long-lasting,\" they wrote. \"As the Administration continues to negotiate with Iran, we are prepared to evaluate any agreement to determine its long-term impact on the United States and our allies.\"\n\nThe Obama administration is up against a March 31 deadline to reach an agreement with Iran over its nuclear programs. Republicans, as well as key ally Israel, have criticized the efforts.\n\nThe Representatives echoed those feelings of concern, saying \"permanent sanctions relief from Congressionally mandated sanctions would require new legislation.\"\n\nWhat else is going on in D.C.?\n\nToday marks the five-year anniversary of the Affordable Care Act. Rep. Gary Palmer said the day is nothing to celebrate.\n\n\"Five years later, the ACA has not lived up to its promises. People are losing their health care plans, are seeing their premiums rise rapidly, being forced to buy coverage they cannot afford, and being penalized if they don't. It is also adding billions to the deficit. Unfortunately, this is just the start of the problems it will create,\" he said.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "AL in DC, opinion", "title": "There's a new Iran letter from Congress and 6 Alabama reps have signed it: AL in DC", "og": {"site_name": "AL.com", "description": "Just weeks after 47 Senators caused an uproar by warning Iranian leaders any deal inked with the Obama administration could be undone once the president left office, 367 Representative have written their own warning missive.", "title": "There's a new Iran letter from Congress and 6 Alabama reps have signed it: AL in DC", "url": "http://www.al.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/03/theres_a_new_iran_letter_from.html", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/opinion/photo/iran-letterjpg-e896dd7b0f56b0db.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just weeks after 47 Senators caused an uproar by warning Iranian leaders any deal inked with the Obama administration could be undone once the president left office, 367 Representative have written their own warning missive.", "creator": "@LeadaGore", "image": "http://image.al.com/home/bama-media/width620/img/opinion/photo/iran-letterjpg-e896dd7b0f56b0db.jpg", "title": "There's a new Iran letter from Congress and 6 Alabama reps have signed it: AL in DC", "site": "@aldotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, March 23, 2015,  4:45 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "AL.com", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/leada.gore"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Monday, March 23, 2015,  4:08 PM", "article_author": "Leada Gore | lgore@al.com", "Description": "Just weeks after 47 Senators caused an uproar by warning Iranian leaders any deal inked with the Obama administration could be undone once the president left office, 367 Representative have written their own warning missive."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd959e\"", "article_summary": "Alabama Reps.
