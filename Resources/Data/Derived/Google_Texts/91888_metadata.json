Steve Russell, an Oklahoma GOPer and a retired U.S. Army officer, demanded paperwork outlining the performance of two women who recently graduated from the vaunted Army Ranger School at Georgia\u2019s Fort Benning.\n\nRussell\u2019s spokesman said he wanted to \u201cmake sure that all of the people who passed the course deserved to pass it\u201d \u2013 about a month after Capt. Kristen Griest and 1st Lt. Shaye Haver became the first women to graduate from the rigorous program.\n\nNow the congressman is about to face his own scrutiny. Several women who graduated from West Point have filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking the Ranger School file for Russell, who earned the Ranger designation in November 1987.\n\nSue Fulton, a 1980 West Point graduate, told the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer why she filed the request. From the report:\n\n\u201cIf Congressman Russell claims that Rangers lie, and can be influenced to ignore standards, perhaps he experienced that when he went through Ranger School,\u201d Fulton said. \u201cWe would like to see definitive proof that he is entitled to his tab.\u201d \u2026Fulton was in the first West Point class to include women. She said about a dozen West Point women graduates have joined her in the call for Russell\u2019s records. A large group of West Point women attended the Ranger School graduation on Aug. 21 when Griest and Haver were awarded their tabs in a historic first. She compared what is happening now with the questioning of the women who have attended and completed Ranger School with what she and her West Point classmates endured. \u201cIt is the same stuff we heard in the early years at West Point,\u201d Fulton said. \u201cThat is why you are seeing these women say enough is enough. They are getting in the way of making the Army stronger. We made the Army stronger. These women will make the Army stronger.\u201d\n\n***\n\nTalk about awkward timing.\n\nGov. Nathan Deal\u2019s visit to automakers in Germany comes as Volkswagen is embroiled in a widening scandal over its admission to rigging emissions testing in the U.S. and growing questions over whether it did the same thing in Europe.\n\nDeal and economic development commissioner Chris Carr visited the headquarters of Porsche, a subsidiary of Volkswagen, this week to thank the company for locating its North American headquarters at a complex near Atlanta\u2019s airport.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the growing crisis was mentioned at the meeting. But to be a fly on the wall \u2026\n\n***\n\nNew DeKalb County Commissioner Nancy Jester said she\u2019s getting police protection after she received threats from a local political group.\n\nFrom our AJC colleague Mark Niesse:\n\nDeKalb County Commissioner Nancy Jester says protesters opposing recent police shootings threatened her, but the activists say there were no threats and they don\u2019t condone violence. Jester called a press conference Wednesday to bring attention to statements by members of the DeKalb County Coalition for Justice and Police Accountability, which has been seeking reforms in how police handle officer-involved shootings of unarmed black men. The activists\u2019 dispute with Jester came after she and other DeKalb officials met with victims\u2019 families last week. The activists say they are concerned because Jester didn\u2019t comment or show compassion during the meeting.\n\nCoalition leader Makungu Akinyela said the group denounces \u201csuch threats or attempts to charge us in making such threats.\u201d\n\n***\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Ben Carson is headed to Gainesville next month.\n\nThe Gainesville Times reports he\u2019ll be at the Free Chapel on Sunday, Oct. 11.\n\nHe\u2019s running in the top tier in most presidential polls, and so far he\u2019s given scant attention to Georgia.\n\n***\n\nRep. Tom Price got a shout-out from another GOP presidential contender, Carly Fiorina, during one of her stops in South Carolina on Thursday.\n\nThe former Hewlett-Packard chief executive told a luncheon crowd in Greenville that the Georgia Republican\u2019s healthcare plan was among the conservative alternatives to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHere\u2019s the transcript:", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "Political Insider blog", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://politics.blog.ajc.com/2015/09/25/oklahama-rep-questions-whether-women-deserved-to-pass-fort-bennings-ranger-school/", "image": "https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2015/09/rangers2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An Oklahoma Republican is learning firsthand the art of the boomerang effect.\r\n\r\nIt started when Rep.
