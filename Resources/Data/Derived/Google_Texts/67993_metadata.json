The video, which was set to stirring music, showed Ryan saying this in a speech:\n\n\u201cWhat really bothers me the most about politics these days is this notion of identity politics: that we\u2019re going to win an election by dividing people, rather than inspiring people on our common humanity and our common ideals and our common culture on the things that should unify us. We all want to be prosperous. We all want to be healthy. We want everybody to succeed. We want people to reach their potential in their lives. Now, liberals and conservatives are going to disagree with one another on that. No problem. That\u2019s what this is all about. So let\u2019s have a battle of ideas. Let\u2019s have a contest of whose ideas are better and why our ideas are better.\u201d\n\nRyan staffers denied that the video was some sort of political campaign ad, so let\u2019s give them the benefit of the doubt on that. The video wasn\u2019t an ad. It was just a regular video with the look, feel, music can\u2019t-we-all-get-along tone of a general election presidential campaign ad that was released just as speculation about Ryan\u2019s prospects in the 2016 campaign have been rapidly escalating.\n\nBesides all that, nothing to see here.\n\nObviously, Ryan knew what he was doing. He has played a curious role throughout the deranged GOP primary, popping up now and then to give vaguely worded criticisms of one Donald Trump comment or another, and then receding into the background. But in the past week, as the chances of a brokered Republican convention have spiked, Ryan\u2019s name has kept popping up.\n\nThe scenario is simple enough: the Republicans get to Cleveland, Donald Trump can\u2019t get a majority of delegates to back him, and instead of going with runner-up Ted Cruz\u2014who, unlike Ryan, has actually been winning lots of votes and primaries\u2014the party installs Ryan as its savior for November. Ryan then presumably sails across America, uniting the people behind his cheerful conservative vision.\n\nOf course, as with everything about Republican politics, this has relatively little to do with substance. Despite Ryan\u2019s gee-whiz persona, he\u2019s the most right-wing House Speaker in decades, with a well-documented devotion to Ayn Rand and a long history of pushing extreme economic proposals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Paul Ryan is not-so-subtly hinting at a brokered-convention bid for the presidency.
