Each summer, Cherokee students retrace the path their Cherokee ancestors were forced to walk along the northern route of the Trail of Tears.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do this ride for years,\u201d said Cassie Moore, a 24-year-old student at Northeastern State University. \u201cI am very excited to be selected and ready to accept the challenge that will come with it. I\u2019m not only excited to meet new people, but help my fellow riders endure this journey that our ancestors overcame.\u201d\n\nThe Remember the Removal Bike Ride begins in New Echota, Georgia in late May and will follow the northern route of the Trail of Tears ending in Oklahoma. The 950-mile journey spans Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Missouri, Arkansas and Oklahoma.\n\nRiders will put their bodies to the test as they travel an average of 60 miles a day for three weeks, mirroring in part the hardships of their Cherokee ancestors who made the same trek on foot. Of the estimated 16,000 Cherokees who were forced to make the journey to Indian Territory, 4,000 died due to exposure, starvation and disease giving credence to the name Trail of Tears.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Each summer, Cherokee students retrace the path their ancestors were forced to walk along the northern route of the Trail of Tears.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "leeanne", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/08/cherokee-nation-selects-2014-remember-removal-riders-153832", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/remember-the-removoval-bike-riders.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Cherokee Nation Selects 2014 Remember the Removal Riders"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-03-08T15:00-05:00", "dc": {"title": "Cherokee Nation Selects 2014 Remember the Removal Riders"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/03/08/cherokee-nation-selects-2014-remember-removal-riders-153832", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Cherokee Nation, Trail of Tears, Native American students, Native American History", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "Cherokee Nation Selects 2014 Remember the Removal Riders"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4091\"", "article_summary": "The Cherokee Nation has selected 13 Cherokee students for the 2014 Remember the Removal Bike Ride.\nEach summer, Cherokee students retrace the path their Cherokee ancestors were forced to walk along the northern route of the Trail of Tears.\nRiders will put their bodies to the test as they travel an average of 60 miles a day for three weeks, mirroring in part the hardships of their Cherokee ancestors who made the same trek on foot.\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do this ride for years,\u201d said Cassie Moore, a 24-year-old student at Northeastern State University.\n\u201cI am very excited to be selected and ready to accept the challenge that will come with it."}
