Finally, the President will discuss ways his Administration can partner with the tech sector to further grow the economy, create jobs and address issues around income inequality and social mobility.\u201d\n\nThe meeting comes one day after a federal judge ruled that an NSA phone data collection program likely violates the Constitution, and one week after eight tech giants released an open letter to Obama and Congress protesting the scale of government surveillance programs. \u201cThis summer\u2019s revelations highlighted the urgent need to reform government surveillance practices worldwide,\u201d AOL, Apple, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter, Yahoo wrote in the letter. \u201cThe balance in many countries has tipped too far in favor of the state and away from the rights of the individual \u2014 rights that are enshrined in our Constitution.
