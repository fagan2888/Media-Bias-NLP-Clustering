For broader and more technical perspectives, consult our monthly \u201cCurrent Wisdom.\u201d\n\nYesterday it was announced by the World Meteorological Organization (an arm of the United Nations), with front page coverage by the global media, that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) last year reached a new high value (396 parts per million, ppm) and got there in record time (2.9ppm/yr). Although newer data (through July of 2014) indicate that the rate of rise has fallen back again to levels more characteristic of the past decade, the signal remains\u2014carbon dioxide is building in the atmosphere and rising to levels that have probably not been seen in along time (hundreds of thousands of years).\n\nThis rise is a continued reminder of the steady drumbeat of human progress. The carbon dioxide that is building in the atmosphere, at least in part, gets there through human emissions of carbon dioxide that are the by-product of burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) to produce the vast majority the energy that has powered mankind\u2019s industrial and technical ascent since the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe gradual increase in the rate of the rise of the carbon dioxide concentration is a sign that we are continuing to expand our energy use and availability, primarily in developing countries like India and China. With more than a billion people still without much access to electricity (and many more than that who would like access to more) and all the life-improving benefits that come with it, we still have a long way to go.\n\nConsequently, we should anticipate that the atmospheric CO 2 concentration will continue to grow for many years to come.\n\nThe benefits that fossil use have delivered to humanity are enormous. A taste of them can be found at Cato\u2019s HumanProgress.org website and a compelling case for why we should continue to embrace and expand fossil fuel use is made by Alex Epstein of the Center for Industrial Progress in his excellent (and very soon forthcoming) book The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels.\n\nThe only concern that arises from growing atmospheric CO2 levels stems from the potential climate changes that may result. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that acts basically to trap heat trying to escape from earth to space. But a growing body of scientific evidence suggests that the projections of climate change that have been made by the current family of computerized climate models has been overdone\u2014that the world will warm up significantly less than has been predicted as a result of our ongoing carbon dioxide emissions. We continue to detail the evidence that the earth\u2019s \u201cclimate sensitivity\u201d to carbon dioxide is less than expected. Our most recent summary of the new, relevant literature on this topic is available here. Less warming means less resultant impacts which mean less worry about rising CO2 levels (and less impetus for government action).\n\nSo rather than accompanying the WMO announcement with hand-wringing and talk of self-destructive doom and gloom\u2014which was obiquitous in media coverage of the data release\u2014the more appropriate response would be to applaud our progress in energy expansion across the world.\n\nThe last time an announcement of atmospheric CO 2 levels reaching some new high (an announcement that could be made virtually every day), we wrote:\n\n[The rise] of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere should remind us of our continuing success at expanding the global supply of energy to meet a growing demand. That success which ultimately leads to an improvement of the global standard of living and a reduction in vulnerability to the vagaries of weather and climate. [The rise] is cause for celebration.\n\nThe same holds today, and will do so far into the future.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The on-going rise in the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is a continued reminder of the steady drumbeat of human progress.", "og": {"site_name": "Cato Institute", "description": "The on-going rise in the level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is a continued reminder of the steady drumbeat of human progress.", "title": "CO2 Going Up.
