But, the lofty ambitions, trite messages, half-hearted allegories and over-the-top caricatures make director Tarsem Singh\u2019s (\u201cThe Cell,\u201d \u201cThe Fall\u201d) latest a misguidedly campy experience.\n\nHere, the dying man, Damian (Kingsley), is possibly the worst person in the world. In the opening scene, he destroys a young competitor who is aiming to encroach on his real estate empire.\n\nDamian, you see, is extremely wealthy and powerful. He\u2019s \u201cthe man who built New York from the ground up\u201d and he can ruin another\u2019s life before lunch, almost for sport.\n\nHe\u2019s also only got six months to live. His cancer has metastasized and he has yet to come to terms with it. He hasn\u2019t even told his daughter (\u201cDownton Abbey\u2019s\u201d Michelle Dockery in a tiny role), although we\u2019ll soon find out that they\u2019re estranged.\n\nThis is a selfish, egotistical man. The type who walks all the way over to the driver\u2019s side of his town car to knock on the window so the driver will get out and open the passenger seat door for him. The type who is so consumed with his own specialness that he will pay $250 million for a new \u201cvessel\u201d for his brilliant mind. The type who also craves immortality so wholly that he doesn\u2019t ask too many questions about the origins of the new body.\n\nThe doctor behind the controversial \u201cshedding\u201d procedure, Albright (a mustache-twirling Matthew Goode), snivels that the bodies are grown in labs. Right.\n\nAnyway, in his new, youthful body Damian goes off to live in New Orleans to play pickup basketball, party and get girls \u2013 a lot of them. (There\u2019s an entire montage of young beauties falling on his bed). Because even with 86 years of wisdom, when you\u2019re suddenly given the body of Ryan Reynolds, priorities shift. So much for using that great mind!\n\nAnd this is the main problem. In Mr. Kingsley\u2019s Damian was a sour, ruthless, brilliant man who\u2019d constructed his own empire in a lifetime. Mr. Reynolds\u2018 Damian is a little dopey, deeply curious and empathetic from the start, lacking even an ounce of that bitter, eagle-eyed intensity and captain of industry drive.\n\nIt\u2019s as though they\u2019re just two completely different men, which makes for a far less interesting film, especially when Damian begins to suspect that perhaps his new body didn\u2019t come out of a lab.\n\nYoung Damian starts having visions of a life on a farm with a woman and child. Albright swears they\u2019re hallucinations, but Damian is compelled to investigate \u2013 perhaps his most out of character move. Why would he start caring about others now?\n\nThat curiosity gets him entangled in the lives of the women in his visions, Madeline (Natalie Martinez) and young daughter Anna (Jaynee-Lynne Kinchen), who he now feels obligated to protect from a murderous Albright and his thugs.\n\nThe rest of the movie is a cat and mouse chase. Despite some gorgeous, studied visuals, it all feels rather standard with increasingly diminished returns.\n\n\u201cSelf/less\u201d imagines itself as a high-concept redemption tale. But in execution, it\u2019s more concerned with the action than the big questions or dark implications, which stay at surface level in the script from Alex Pastor and David Pastor.\n\nDamian makes a few sacrifices along the way (although they\u2019re also primarily selfish acts) and finds a certain peace amid the chaos, but we never cared. The movie just assumes the audience will develop some empathy for him along the way, never wondering why we\u2019d ever root for this awful billionaire\u2013 even in Ryan Reynolds\u2018 body.\n\n\u201cSelf/less,\u201d a Focus Features release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association of America for \u201csequences of violence, some sexuality, and language.\u201d Running time: 116 minutes.
