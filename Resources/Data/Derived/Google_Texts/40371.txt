WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders says he opposes a unilateral American no-fly zone in Syria, arguing that it could pull the U.S. into the Syrian civil war and "lead to a never-ending U.S. entanglement in that region."

Sanders says he supports President Barack Obama's efforts to fight the Islamic State group in Syria and efforts by Syrian rebels to overthrow President Bashar Assad. But his opposition to a no-fly zone in Syria puts him at odds with Democratic presidential rival Hillary Rodham Clinton. She announced her support of a no-fly zone this week.

Supporters have said a no-fly zone would help stem the flow of refugees and neutralize Assad's warplanes and helicopters. The White House has so far resisted the calls, saying it would be difficult to enforce.
