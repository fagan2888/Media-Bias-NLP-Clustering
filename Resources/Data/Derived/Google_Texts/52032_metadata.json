But that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening here. Instead of echoing partisan cliches, San Diego\u2019s elected officials are actually compromising and getting things done.\n\nOn the same day as the divisive House of Representatives vote to overturn President Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration, Mayor Kevin Faulconer, a Republican, called for comprehensive immigration reform during this State of the City speech.\n\nAt a time when the Republican majority in Congress is seeking an ironclad border, Faulconer speaks of the San Diego-Baja region as one, and is planning regular meetings with this counterpart in Tijuana.\n\nRep. Scott Peters, a Democrat, has sought to increase the military budget, which has been limited by the automatic sequestration designed to check government spending. He recently helped secure funding for the refueling and overhaul of the nuclear carrier USS George Washington to keep the Navy\u2019s aircraft carrier fleet at 11.\n\nPeters has also strayed from the Democratic mainstream by joining many Republicans in seeking a repeal of the medical device tax in the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. He cited concerns that the tax would stifle innovation in health care.\n\nA year and a half ago, when most Republicans in Congress voted against increasing the national debt limit, Rep. Darell Issa voted to raise it. This helped the United States avert a default, which would have brought the world economy to an abrupt halt and made the Great Depression seem like a happy time.\n\nAt the state level, Toni Atkins, a Democrat, has been a strong proponent of tax credits for business under the California Competes program. She has personally championed a bill to make it easier to create dockside seafood markets throughout the state.\n\nWith California facing a record-breaking drought, the state Republican Party is calling for more dams to be built. In San Diego, however, the Republican-dominated City Council is quietly investing in large-scale water recycling with a goal of getting a third of our water this way in two decades.\n\nThe San Diego County Board of Supervisors, officially a non-partisan body but dominated by Republicans, unanimously voted for incentives to encourage all taxicabs serving Lindbergh Field to convert to alternative fuels. \u201cWe have an opportunity at our airport to encourage 100 percent conversion of our older polluting taxis to new low-emitting hybrid electric or alternative fuel vehicles,\u201d said Supervisor Greg Cox, the measure\u2019s sponsor.\n\nNo to be outdone on the environment, Faulconer pledged in his State of the City speech to make San Diego the \u201cgreen-energy capital of the world\u201d and create a \u201csustainable tomorrow\u201d for residents.\n\nTo be sure, former Mayor Bob Filner\u2019s tenure did not reflect well on San Diego. But in the nearly two years since his resignation, San Diego politics looks very pragmatic. If the purpose of a local government is to solve problems for all residents of the city, then San Diego appears to doing a very good job.\n\nAfter the final tally in his close re-election victory in November, Peters summed up the centrist philosophy this way:\n\n\u201cMy commitment to San Diego is to continue\u2026working with members of both parties to break the gridlock and get things done for my district and the nation,\u201d he said in his victory statement. \u201cMy campaign moved beyond the false choices that dominate the current dialogue in Washington, and answered the voters\u2019 demand for practical, centrist solutions.\u201d\n\nMaybe the \u201cAmerica\u2019s Finest City\u201d slogan should be changed to \u201cAmerica\u2019s Smartest City\u201d \u2014 at least when it comes to politics.\n\nChris Jennewein is editor and publisher of Times of San Diego.\n\n>> Subscribe to Times of San Diego\u2019s free daily email newsletter!
