Some very potent intercourse takes place between a working-class high school student and an upper-class artist, but that is only half the story. \u201cI actually believe that the other themes in the film, specifically the social class division \u2014 there\u2019s a gap \u2014 are problems that are even more important in our society,\u201d director Abdellatif Kechiche recently told Interview. Where the two lovers come from is essential to the thrust of his fifth feature. \u201c[T]hematically, what really interested me the most was a love story between two women, or two people that came out of very different social milieus,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd to deal with the breakup, which is the result of belonging to different social milieus.\u201d\n\nA devoted practitioner of Renoirian realism, the filmmaker hired two actresses who shared his heroines\u2019 socio-economic backgrounds. L\u00e9a Seydoux, granddaughter of the chairman of Path\u00e9, \u201ccomes from an extremely wealthy, bourgeois, very comfortable milieu\u201d and plays Emma. Relative neophyte Ad\u00e8le Exarchopoulos, who \u201ccomes from something that is definitely much more modest,\u201d plays Ad\u00e8le. Kechiche admitted in The Guardian last week that he chooses working-class actresses like Exarchopoulos as a \u201cpolitical\u201d move, saying \u201cit\u2019s a real satisfaction for me to bring them into a profession that wouldn\u2019t have been open to them otherwise.\u201d Though he denied a preference for either \u201cBlue\u201d character, Kechiche told Collider he felt an affinity for Adele in terms of \u201cwhere she\u2019s coming from in the social class \u2013 the proletarian working class that I grew up in and identify with and that she works and exists in.\u201d\n\nThe class conflict that eventually ruptures the film\u2019s romance mirrors the real-life war that recently erupted between Kechiche and Seydoux. In a now-infamous interview with The Daily Beast following \u201cBlue\u2019s\u201d Cannes premiere, Exarchopoulos suggested Kechiche was disrespectful in the way he filmed her sex scenes with Seydoux and that he exercised \u201ca kind of manipulation.\u201d She said the stars \u201cwere really suffering\u201d during a fight sequence in which Seydoux was encouraged to hit Exarchopoulos numerous times. \u201cIt was horrible,\u201d Seydoux acceded and abruptly announced she would \u201cnever\u201d work with Kechiche again. In a subsequent interview with The Independent, she added that the film\u2019s sex scenes made her feel \u201clike a prostitute.\u201d\n\nIn response, Kechiche waged what appeared to be a class war, using Seydoux\u2019s privilege as ammunition. In reference to her interview with the Beast, he reportedly told Canal+, \u201cIf L\u00e9a hadn\u2019t had such a sheltered upbringing she would have never said that.\u201d In an op-ed for the French website Rue 89, Kechiche criticised the 28-year-old actress for having \u201cthe arrogance of a spoiled child\u201d and belonging to \u201can untouchable caste that turns her into a sort of \u2018Princess and the Pea.\u2019\u201d He also accused her of hypocrisy. \u201cIf she really lived what she says, why did she come to Cannes crying, thanking, climbing the stairs, spending days trying on dresses and jewelry? What job does she have, actress or gala artist?\u201d But the coup de grace came when he told Canal+, \u201cL\u00e9a Seydoux is part of a system that doesn\u2019t want me, because I disturb it.\u201d\n\nThat system is French film and the disturbance, according to Kechiche, is his ethnicity. \u201cBecause of my social origins and my roots, I have a hard time getting judged like an artist,\u201d the Tunisia-born Frenchman said in Telerama. Lia Brozgal, Assistant Professor in UCLA\u2019s Dept. of French and Francophone Studies, said the \u201cpalpable and pervasive\u201d tension between the French and North African (including Tunisian) immigrants stems from the lengthy war for Algerian independence, which lasted from 1954 to 1962. \u201cEven today, many French feel deep animosity toward the Algerians \u2014 animosity rooted in the events of the war and its aftermath,\u201d she said via email. \u201cAs if this weren\u2019t already unfortunate, Tunisians and Moroccans, who make up a proportionally smaller number of North African immigrants than Algerians, nonetheless get lumped into the same camp.\u201d In 2007, Kechiche admitted in Le Monde that his upbringing \u201cwas marked by the difficulties and racism suffered by a child of immigrants.\u201d\n\nPanivong Norindr, Associate Professor of French and the Comparative Literature Chair at USC, has written about Kechiche\u2019s \u201cpolitical cinema\u201d and agrees that the filmmaker\u2019s background is the reason he is not often cited as a French auteur. \u201cPeople want to peg him as an immigrant filmmaker, of \u2018beur\u2019 or Tunisian descent,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he\u2019s not didactic, he\u2019s not moralistic, he doesn\u2019t take the position of the victim.\u201d According to Brozgal, the term \u201cbeur,\u201d a colloquialism for those born in France whose parents emigrated from North Africa, \u201cindicates a very low status, socio-economically.\u201d Despite being a successful filmmaker, Kechiche reportedly still chooses to live in Paris\u2019s \u201cArab town,\u201d Belleville. \u201cFor me the important thing about living there is that it\u2019s a working-class district,\u201d he told the Guardian.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sex and sexuality are only half the film's story.
