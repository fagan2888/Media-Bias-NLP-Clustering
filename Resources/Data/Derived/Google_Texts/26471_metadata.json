He said the driver turned himself in several hours after the crash.\n\n\n\nNews of the accident traveled around the University of Arizona campus. Sunday afternoon, some students admitted that they\u2019re extra cautious when walking around Tucson after this accident.\n\n\n\nClaire Lorenzetti said she and some friends avoided major roadways Saturday night after hearing about what happened on Euclid.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were walking to dinner and just kind of took the back roads because we were afraid of the main cars getting to us,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nAustin Martin, who lives in a nearby dorm, said he immediately thought of his roommates when he heard the news.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe fact that it was so close to where we live, so close to home that for me it\u2019s so scary,\u201d he said. \u201cIt gets to me that it could have been one of us.\u201d\n\n\n\nMartin said he will be looking both ways several times before crossing any streets and no longer trusting cars with turn signals on until they make the turn.\n\n\n\nJavier Ortega, who said he\u2019s seen close calls in the same area as the accident, said there\u2019s not much more that pedestrians can do to stay safe, so it\u2019s up to the drivers around campus.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s someone careening through a crosswalk you don\u2019t really have much control over that, unfortunately,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cIt definitely makes me think twice about where I\u2019m going and paying attention to my surroundings.\u201d\n\n\n\nUniversity of Arizona President Ann Weaver Hart released the following statement about the accident:\n\n\"We all hurt when tragedy strikes the Wildcat family and it is especially painful when several students are involved. The thoughts and best wishes of all of us are with our students injured in yesterday's incident and with their families. I also want\n\nto thank the emergency medical staff and police who responded so quickly to help. We hope for a complete recovery for all and their swift return to campus.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2015 Tucson News Now.
