Miller, the former general counsel of America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), joined the firm as a partner in its Antitrust and Health Care groups.\n\nBased in the firm's Washington, D.C. office, Miller advises clients on a broad range of health care and antitrust issues, including health care reform risk and regulatory issues arising under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, and developing corporate compliance policies.\n\n\"Joe is an exceptional lawyer,\" said Angela B. Styles, chair of Crowell & Moring. \"He enhances our Antitrust and Health Care groups and brings with him exemplary experience as a trusted advisor for both strategic transactions and health care regulatory issues.\"\n\nAs the former general counsel of AHIP, the national trade association of the health insurance industry, Miller was at the forefront of critical legal, regulatory, and policy issues facing the health industry. He supervised a team of attorneys on all aspects of AHIP's legal work, including policy development, strategic advice, and general corporate work. Miller also served as AHIP's policy lead on cybersecurity.\n\nBefore joining AHIP, Miller served as assistant chief of the Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division's Litigation 1 Section, where he was responsible for antitrust enforcement in the health industry and other sectors.

He started his legal career as a trial attorney in the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition.\n\n\"Joe's deep industry knowledge will strengthen our preeminent health care antitrust and regulatory practices,\" said Arthur N. Lerner, leader of the firm's Health Care Industry Initiative. \"His experience \u2014 first as a government antitrust enforcer and more recently as an industry association executive during a time of momentous industry change \u2014 will be extremely valuable to clients navigating critical business strategy issues, particularly those involving government enforcement, internal compliance, new regulations, or broader health care policy issues.\"\n\n\"This is an exciting opportunity to join a firm that already has a deep well of expertise in the areas of health care and antitrust,\" said Miller. \"I look forward to expanding the firm's capabilities and the opportunity to work with Crowell & Moring's many talented lawyers, serving health clients as well as clients in other fields.\"\n\nMiller earned his J.D. from George Mason University School of Law and his B.A. from Emory University.
