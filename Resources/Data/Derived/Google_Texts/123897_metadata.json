Currently, the federal government picks up the entire $600,000 tab for Delaware\u2019s navigators.\n\nA recent survey shows that the percentage of uninsured adults in Delaware declined from 14.3 percent in 2013 to 10.8 percent last year, with the most significant gains in the black population, according to state officials.\n\nBut Landgraf said on Aug. 6 that more work needs to be done to reach the Hispanic community, especially in Sussex County. State officials said last month that the percentage of uninsured Hispanics grew from 37.1 percent in 2013 to 40.2 percent last year. Landgraf said she is working with members of a subcommittee of the Delaware Hispanic Commission to address the issue.\n\nLandgraf also noted that Delaware lagged behind national averages in enrolling adults aged 18 to 44 under the Affordable Care Act and the state had fewer enrollees in \u201csilver\u201d level insurance plans, despite the availability of government subsidies.\n\nThe Obama administration has asked states to carefully scrutinize big rate increases sought by insurers providing coverage under the health law so that insurance can remain affordable for consumers.\n\nIn Delaware, Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield has filed for an average rate increase of 25.4 percent for 2016 ACA individual plans. The specific rate increase would vary by plan, ranging from 19.6 percent to 29.2 percent.\n\nAetna Health Inc. and Aetna Life Insurance Co. are seeking to raise average premium rates for individual plans by more than 16 percent.\n\nRelated:\n\nCopyright 2016 Associated Press.
