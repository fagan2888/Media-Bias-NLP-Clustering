A Tampa General Hospital nurse was charged with leaving the scene of a fatal accident on Saturday. Police say Danielle Nichole Goeller was driving a car that hit a pedestrian who had stepped into the roadway, but allegedly left the scene, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

After being alerted of a damaged Volvo in a nearby parking lot, Tampa police arrested Goeller, the Times reports.

In another case, the prison sentence of a South Florida pill mill kingpin has been reduced after he cooperated with prosecutors, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reports.

Christopher George testified last summer during the trial of two doctors he hired to prescribe painkillers to addicts, but U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra rejected a request to shave six years off George’s sentence. Instead, he reduced the 17 ½ -year sentence to 14 years, the Sun Sentinel reports.

His twin, Jeffrey George, pleaded guilty for his role in operating clinics in Broward and Palm Beach Counties and is serving 15 ½ years in federal prison.
