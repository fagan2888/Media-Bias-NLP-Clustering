(Source: KPHO/KTVK)\n\nInvestigation documents released by the Arizona Department of Public Safety this week show what the I-10 freeway shooting suspect told police during his interrogation.\n\nThe 1,200+ page investigation report also details interviews with Leslie Merritt Jr., his wife and co-workers.\n\nMerritt Jr. vehemently denied being responsible for the August 29 and 30 freeway shootings that terrorized the Valley.\n\nMerritt Jr. was arrested outside a Wal-mart on September 18. Detectives interrogated him after the arrest.\n\n\"I have never fired a shot on the freeway,\" Merritt told detectives according to the investigation report. \"Dude, that's just - I'm telling you, that's the stupidest (expletive) anybody could do.\u201d\n\nMerritt also claimed he hadn\u2019t fired his 9mm Hi-Point handgun in the previous two months before his arrest. According to the documents, he did, however, admit to carrying the weapon almost everywhere he went before pawning the gun in Phoenix following several of the freeway shootings.\n\n\"I don't shoot my gun in the city like that. That's just stupid. That's just - I'm not that dumb man,\u201d Merritt Jr. allegedly told detectives.\n\nHowever, police have said between August 29 and August 30 of last summer four cars were shot while driving along various stretches of the I-10. Detectives found bullets and bullet fragments in each case. Ballistics tests matched all of them to Merritt Jr.'s 9mm handgun, according to the investigation documents. According to DPS, Merritt Jr. pawned the gun in Phoenix right after the shootings started.\n\nAfter Merritt Jr.\u2019s arrest, his wife visited him in jail and their conversation was recorded.\n\n\u201cSo, I got my alibis, Tio Tony, Tia Sophie, and TJ, to say that, yes, we were there, Saturday and Sunday. I got my dad too,\u201d said a quote from the report attributed to Merritt Jr.\u2019s wife during a visit with Merritt Jr. behind bars.\n\nBut the investigation documents also said phone records show Merritt Jr. and his wife were not at the places mentioned in her alibi on August 29.\n\nMerritt Jr.\u2019s attorneys were not able to comment on this story because they\u2019re under gag order from the court. Merritt Jr. is due back in court March 24.\n\nCopyright 2016 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
