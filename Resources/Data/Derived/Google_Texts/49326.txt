The United States and Canada are joining forces to fight cyberattacks in the wake of a spree of ominous hacking attempts on North American hospitals and the growing threat of “ransomware,” a type of virus that demands payment from the hacking victim.

One case that has raised the alarm in the health care sector was the cyberattack on Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles. Hackers infiltrated the hospital’s system and then demanded a ransom to leave. The hospital quickly paid the $17,000 ransom demanded in bitcoins, the cyber currency.
