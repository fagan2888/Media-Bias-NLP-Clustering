But, much like opening up a gift and finding clothes, drafting a player who becomes a bust is no fun. Luckily for all the fantasy enthusiasts out there, I\u2019ve compiled a list of a couple players owners should watch out for.\n\nQuarterback\n\nDrew Brees, New Orleans Saints \u2014 Drew Brees has long been a coveted pick for fantasy owners, an elite quarterback in fantasy for more than half a decade. This year, however, it looks as if the Saints\u2019 quarterback is finally out of gas. Brees lost his top target in Jimmy Graham to a trade to Seattle. The team\u2019s former deep threat, wide receiver Kenny Stills, is now in Miami. Wide receiver Marques Colston is 32 years old, which leaves Brees with a relatively young receiving corps and a rejuvenated run game led by 5th-year man Mark Ingram.\n\nRunning Back\n\nDeMarco Murray, Philadelphia Eagles \u2014 OK, this is a long one. DeMarco Murray was probably the biggest surprise from last year\u2019s fantasy football season. Murray led all running backs with 1,845 yards and 13 rushing touchdowns while gathering an additional 416 receiving yards. Murray had a whopping 392 carries last year, surpassing the the next highest back \u2014 LeSean McCoy, ironically enough \u2014 by 80 carries.\n\nHistorically speaking, that doesn\u2019t bode well for Murray. From Kansas City\u2019s Larry Johnson, who had 416 carries in 2006 and went on to miss eight games in 2007, to Denver legend Terrell Davis, who also had 392 carries in 1998 only to play four games the following year (though he did have 369 carries in 1997), the NFL\u2019s history books have more than a few tales of running backs who couldn\u2019t come back from having more than 370 carries.\n\nThe \u201cCurse of 370\u201d is well-documented when it comes to Murray, but consider it from a different angle. Monday, Chip Kelly held Murray out of practice because he wasn\u2019t hydrated enough (Kelly places emphasis on sports science). It\u2019s not too far-fetched to suggest that Kelly may scale Murray\u2019s carries back this season in order to keep him healthy.\n\nIf that\u2019s too much of a stretch, let\u2019s consider Murray\u2019s debut season in Philadelphia, starting with the Eagles\u2019 offensive line. This year, they\u2019re looking to fill the void left by Evan Mathis and Todd Herremans, their two starting guards. Their line is probably not going to be as good as Dallas\u2019 was last year.\n\nSecond, Murray\u2019s not the only name in town at the running back position. Darren Sproles and Ryan Mathews aren\u2019t slouches either. Both have been viable fantasy backs in the past.\n\nFinally, remember the shenanigans Kelly pulled with three running backs last year? Sorry to bring up a sore spot for LeSean McCoy owners, but who can forget Chris Polk vulturing two touchdowns on his lone two carries of the night \u2014 in Week 15 no less? Chip Kelly favors to be the new Bill Belichick of fantasy football \u2014 orchestrating schemes in which a player scores four touchdowns one week and then isn\u2019t heard from the rest of the season. OK, maybe Kelly won\u2019t be that bad, but the point is this: There are many reasons to doubt an encore from Murray.\n\nWide receiver\n\nJeremy Maclin, Kansas City Chiefs \u2014 Maclin had a breakout season last year, emerging as a top 10 wideout with 1,318 yards and 10 touchdowns with the Philadelphia Eagles. Maclin performed more than admirably as the No.1 wideout in Philly last year, but don\u2019t expect a repeat performance.\n\nMaclin has been reunited with former Eagles coach Andy Reid in Kansas City. Yes, the same Kansas City that didn\u2019t have a single touchdown scored by a wide receiver last year. But that was last year and KC revamped its receiving corps by adding Maclin. But who else is there? Jason Avant, another member of Reid\u2019s Eagles, and rookie Chris Conley out of Georgia, most notably. Also, Maclin\u2019s new quarterback is Alex Smith, who isn\u2019t known for slinging the ball around (unless checkdowns count). As embarrassing as it is for an NFL team to not have a single receiver score a touchdown over the course of an NFL season, look for Maclin to get in the end zone more than once this year. Just don\u2019t draft him expecting to see last year\u2019s result.\n\nBrandon Marshall, New York Jets \u2014 This is more of an indictment of the Jets\u2019 offense than of Marshall the player. Reports from New York suggest that Geno Smith is finally looking the part of franchise quarterback and has yet to throw an interception in training camp. There\u2019s still reason to be skeptical of Smith, however, and any shaky play would create problems for Marshall\u2019s production.\n\nThere are also concerns about the offensive line. Left tackle D\u2019Brickashaw Ferguson has been on the decline, and the team is looking to fill a void at right guard, though former Seahawk James Carpenter seems to be the man for the job. Also, Marshall wasn\u2019t exactly the pinnacle of health last year, he missed five games last season. He missed one game with an ankle injury and the final four after breaking his ribs. The 31-year-old receiver is no longer among the NFL\u2019s elite. That much is obvious, but he\u2019s still a risky option at best, even as a second receiver on fantasy teams.\n\nTight End\n\nJulius Thomas, Jacksonville Jaguars \u2014 Good on Julius Thomas for landing a 5-year, $46 million contract with Jacksonville ($24 million of that is guaranteed). Thomas has been beastly these past two seasons. He was the third-best tight end in 2013. Last year, Thomas had 489 yards and 12 touchdowns, ranking him seventh among all fantasy tight ends. Unfortunately for Thomas and fantasy owners, Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning had a lot to do with that success. Now Thomas has sophomore quarterback Blake Bortles to catch balls from. Bortles isn\u2019t Manning, and as such, Thomas\u2019 numbers are going to take a dive. And Thomas\u2019 injury history should be a red flag.\n\nWHO TO WATCH\n\nMatthew Stafford, Detroit Lions quarterback \u2014 Matthew Stafford isn\u2019t quite a bust, but there is reason for concern. He was looking good heading into the offseason, but Detroit\u2019s offense has changed. Gone are the days of Stafford throwing for 5,000-plus yards and 41 touchdowns as he did in 2011. Lions offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi is entering his second year in Detroit, and he\u2019s looking to implement a more balanced approach. While Lombardi\u2019s approach will certainly mean fewer yards and passing attempts for Stafford, it should also cut down on Stafford\u2019s turnovers. Last year, he threw just 12 interceptions, a career low. Stafford also threw for just 4,257 yards last season \u2014 his lowest since 2011.\n\nBottom line: Stafford may be heading in the same direction as Tony Romo. He\u2019ll be a prolific, efficient passer with the weapons to have some big games, but the balance between run and pass means he\u2019ll struggle over the course of the season to produce at an elite level.\n\nAlfred Blue, Houston Texans running back \u2014 As soon as I was typing that Arian Foster would be a bust, Foster went down with a groin injury. This piece was going to say: \u201cFoster has yet as yet to play a full season since the 2012, but despite that, he still managed to be one of the NFL\u2019s elite last year. The volume will likely be there for Foster again this year, especially with wide receiver Andre Johnson in Indianapolis.\u201d\n\nThe same is true for Foster\u2019s backup Alfred Blue, but he was able to only tally 88 yards against the Giants, despite them being a team that yielded the seventh most points to opposing running backs last year, according to NFL.com. On the positive side, Blue rushed for 156 yards during Week 11 in Cleveland. This year, Blue is flanked by former Eagles back Chris Polk and Jonathan Grimes and will likely split some carries with them. Polk has been dealing with a hamstring injury and has been sidelined the past couple days. From sheer volume, Blue is worth a look, but don\u2019t overpay for him. He\u2019s likely to lose production after Foster\u2019s return or because Houston decides to commit to a running-back-by-committee approach.\n\nNext week, I\u2019ll look at potential sleepers.\n\nHugh Johnson: 303-954-1037, hjohnson@denverpost.com or twitter.com/HughJohnsonDP", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Fantasy Football busts for 2015: Drew Brees and DeMarco Murray", "title": "Fantasy Football busts for 2015: Drew Brees and DeMarco Murray", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/08/fantasy-football-busts-for-2015-drew-brees-and-demarco-murray/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808__murrayp1-1.jpg", "height": 513}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808__murrayp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-08T18:44:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T09:42:43+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Fantasy Football"}, "article_summary": "QuarterbackDrew Brees, New Orleans Saints \u2014 Drew Brees has long been a coveted pick for fantasy owners, an elite quarterback in fantasy for more than half a decade.\nDeMarco Murray was probably the biggest surprise from last year\u2019s fantasy football season.\nMurray led all running backs with 1,845 yards and 13 rushing touchdowns while gathering an additional 416 receiving yards.\nMurray had a whopping 392 carries last year, surpassing the the next highest back \u2014 LeSean McCoy, ironically enough \u2014 by 80 carries.\nWHO TO WATCHMatthew Stafford, Detroit Lions quarterback \u2014 Matthew Stafford isn\u2019t quite a bust, but there is reason for concern."}
