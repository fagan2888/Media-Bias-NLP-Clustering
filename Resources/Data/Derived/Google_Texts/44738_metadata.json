Do I dare raise the incendiary topic of health care? I can practically hear the \"thanks, Obamas\" piping hot off the tongues of folks who are tired of a system failing them.\n\nBut this is not a column examining the successes or failures of Obamacare. Instead, I\u2019d like to take a look at one care model that seeks to treat families when appointment-based care isn\u2019t available and the waiting room at the ER appears interminable.\n\nIn the health care food chain, the urgent health care center is a rung above a retail clinic (such as a pharmacy\u2019s walk-in clinic where you might get a strep culture). Urgent care centers are generally staffed and equipped for broken bones, burns and other conditions that retail clinics are not equipped to handle. Their copay is usually lower than an ER's, as is their waiting time.\n\nBut are these clinics good for Chattanooga? Do they skirt the long-term relationship that primary care physicians intend to have with their patients?\n\nIn Chattanooga, we have at least two urgent care clinics that specialize in pediatrics. These clinics are open late hours, as it is guaranteed that kids will invariably spike a fever, break an arm or develop uncontrollable diarrhea during hours when their primary care physicians have long since left the office. Would you like to be the \"uncontrollable diarrhea, party of two\" in the ER waiting room? The urgent care clinics can be a real gift for many parents.\n\nIn my case, the late-night pediatric clinic poses no threat to my kids\u2019 relationship with their primary care physicians. We have visited both P.M. Pediatrics and the Beacon Health Pediatric Night Clinic, and received excellent care. We also received Popsicles in the cases when my kids had strep throat\u2014love getting that copay\u2019s worth.\n\nI realize I\u2019m speaking from a position of significant privilege, though. I carry health insurance through my employer that makes this care accessible for my family. Many urgent care facilities do not accept Medicaid/TennCare. Additionally, the two pediatric night clinics I\u2019ve visited are within blocks of one another. They may be too much of a hike for many families in Chattanooga, especially those dependent on public transportation.\n\nI don\u2019t purport to be an expert in equitable health care solutions, so, I leave it to you, dear readers: What do you think of urgent care facilities in Chattanooga? Do you use them? Do you think they are disassembling the patient-primary care physician relationship? Does Chattanooga need more of these, or is there another health care model that can help fill in the gaps between appointment-based care and the ER?\n\nKendra Stanton Lee is a transplant to Chattanooga via Boston.
