He plans to live on an iceberg in a kevlar boat/shelter for eight to 12 months to \u201cto demonstrate just how quickly things are changing\u201d in the arctic. His plan is to park his boat/shelter on an iceberg off Greenland this spring, and float around for a while \u201cdocumenting the melting process as [the iceberg] disappears completely.\u201d\n\nBellini might be up there a while. Arctic sea ice levels are up 30 percent this winter, and ice levels at both poles combined is above the long-term average. But here\u2019s the thing: Ice builds in the arctic every winter, then as spring and then summer comes, those icebergs melt. Bellini will only be dramatically \u201cdocumenting\u201d something that is entirely natural and happens every year.\n\nBesides, an iceberg already in the ocean off Greenland \u2014 which is where Bellini will park his boat \u2014 does not increase sea leverl rise. Here\u2019s an experiment you can do at home: Fill a glass with water and ice. Mark the level. Let it melt. Once melted, it will be a the same level.\n\nSpending months all alone worrying about an increasing population of polar bears finding you easier prey than waiting for a seal to surface in an air hole sure seems a strange way to \u201cprove\u201d nothing. But I\u2019m not a global warming nut, so whatever (eventually) floats Bellini\u2019s boat.\n\n(NOTE: If you\u2019re interested in what is really happning to the climate \u2014 science based on observable data, rather than flawed climate models aimed at political ends \u2014 visit the Climate Change Reconsidered by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), and also check out Heartland\u2019s eight international conferences on climate change where you can view more than 100 video presentations.)\n\n[HT: Breitbart", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://blog.heartland.org/2014/01/italian-climate-nut-to-live-on-iceberg-to-prove-global-warming/", "site_name": "Somewhat Reasonable", "image": "http://blog.heartland.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/alex-bellini-iceberg-global-warming-climate-change.jpg", "type": "activity", "title": "Italian Climate Nut to Live on Iceberg to \u2018Prove\u2019 Global Warming"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdde6c\"", "article_summary": "(NOTE: If you\u2019re interested in what is really happning to the climate \u2014 science based on observable data, rather than flawed climate models aimed at political ends \u2014 visit the Climate Change Reconsidered by the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC), and also check out Heartland\u2019s eight international conferences on climate change where you can view more than 100 video presentations.)\nBut I\u2019m not a global warming nut, so whatever (eventually) floats Bellini\u2019s boat.\nIt looks like we\u2019re going to get two stunts back to back that turn into disasters for the science-denying extremists who insist man is causing run-away, catastrophic global warming.\nThe first was around Christmas when University of New South Wales climate professor Chris Turney set sail on the Good Ship Global Warming (the Russian charter, Akademik Shokalskiy) to prove human activity was melting the East Antarctic ice sheet .\nArctic sea ice levels are up 30 percent this winter, and ice levels at both poles combined is above the long-term average."}
