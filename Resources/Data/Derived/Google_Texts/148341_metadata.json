plan Senators hope for deal soon on mental health bill MORE (R-Ky.) and his party to work with Democrats on a \"clean\" budget deal that would ensure that the government remains open beyond Dec. 11, when the stopgap spending measure expires.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cNow it\u2019s time for responsible members of the Republican party to grab the reins and move quickly to put together a bipartisan deal,\u201d Schumer said in a conference call with reporters.\n\nSchumer said that a deal couldn't include any \u201cideological poison-pill riders\" and must end sequestration and raise the spending caps set two years ago.\n\nHe argued that Republicans slipped their policy preferences into the last spending bill without discussing them on the Senate floor because \"they know the public is against them on these issues and they know they\u2019d lose.\"\n\n\"So what they\u2019re trying to do, particularly the hard-liners, is trying to shove these riders down the American people\u2019s throats by saying even though we couldn\u2019t pass these on their own, we\u2019re saying we\u2019re going to shut down the government unless we get our rider,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201dInstead, what we need to do is to work in a bipartisan way to come up with an agreement for three simple reasons: for jobs, jobs and jobs.\u201d\n\nLast month, McConnell offered a bipartisan stopgap spending bill free of the Planned Parenthood dispute at the center of budget talks in the upper chamber.\n\nMcConnell has vowed not to repeat the government shutdown of two years ago.\n\nSchumer also called for any agreement to include matching funding for programs that help middle-class Americans for every dollar spent on defense.\n\nStabenow said what is needed is a Murray-Ryan 2.0 budget plan because \u201cwe\u2019re fundamentally at a crossroads fighting for a budget that is rigged for the wealthy at the expense of everyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to update that budget and avoid what could be catastrophic,\u201d she added.\n\nThe groups, including Planned Parenthood, the AFL-CIO and League of Conservation Voters, all said that preserving any of the more than 100 policy riders in the stopgap measure would take much-needed funding from women\u2019s healthcare, consumer protection, worker safety, public health and the environment.\n\nDawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood \u2014 which has been at the center of a fight among conservatives \u2014 said that the budget fight shouldn\u2019t turn ideological because it is about \u201caccess to critical healthcare to millions [of people].\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood has defended its record on Capitol Hill after videos emerged showing how the group handles fetal tissue provided to health-related researchers.\n\nThe group has said it did nothing wrong and didn't break federal law.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Two Senate Democrats joined labor and women\u2019s healthcare
