In a Nov. 25 press release, the township outlined a number of reasons for the increase, such as low real estate sales, the impact of the Affordable Care Act, an increase in general operating costs and the cost of the current level of public safety services. Forty percent of the General Fund Budget goes to the police department, Perrone said. \u0093No other department consumes that much of the budget,\u0094 he said. \u0093Clearly, in the General Fund, the police department is the driving force.\u0094\n\nAlso playing a role in the increase are federal and state mandates for which the township is not given funding, such as the MS4 stormwater management requirements, the press release stated.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerrone pointed out that Upper Gwynedd is one of only eight communities in Montgomery County that offers the Homestead Exemption, a statewide tax relief program that reduces the assessed value of all owner-occupied residential properties by $30,000 for tax purposes. The exemption was put into place in 2006.\n\n\u0093We believe that approximately 70 to 75 \u0097 maybe even 80 \u0097 percent of our taxpayers have enrolled in the program,\u0094 Perrone said. Anyone wishing to sign up can find an outline of the process on the township\u0092s website, www.uppergwynedd.org.\n\nAnother increase comes in the form of the sewer rates, which will increase by 15 percent in 2014. According to the township\u0092s press release, the increase will result in a residential increase of approximately $48.\n\nThe increase in the sewer rates has resulted partly from mandates imposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, including an expansion of the township\u0092s wastewater treatment plant. \u0093We are frequently faced with improvements on our sewer system,\u0094 Perrone said. Also figuring into the equation are the additional operating costs associated with these mandates, such as manpower and chemicals.\n\nThe 2014 budget is available to the public at the township building, located at 1 Parkside Place, and a summary of the budget will be advertised within the next few days, Perrone said. The budget is expected to be approved at a Dec. 23 public meeting.\n\nFollow Victoria Wolk on Twitter at @VictoriaWolk.
