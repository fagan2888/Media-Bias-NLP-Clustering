Divide and multiply peonies

Fall is the best time to dig, divide and plant peonies. Members of the Minnesota Peony Society will demonstrate how to dig and clean roots prior to dividing them. You can use the roots to create new beds or share with other gardeners. Peony growers will also auction peony roots in a wide variety of colors and flower form, including some rare collectible peonies. The demonstration is at noon Sept. 29, followed by the auction fundraiser at 1 p.m., Bachman’s, 6010 Lyndale Av. S., Mpls. Call 612-861-7600.
