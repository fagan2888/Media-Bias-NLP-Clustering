It hasn\u2019t cut taxes or simplified them. It hasn\u2019t reformed immigration law. And it hasn\u2019t managed to prevent President Obama\u2019s deal to lift the nuclear sanctions that had been imposed on Iran. It did, however, manage to haul before it a leading Democratic candidate for president, Hillary Clinton, and subject her to 11 hours of questioning about her email and the deaths, in an attack that began on September 11, 2012, of four Americans at Benghazi, Libya.\n\nIn one sense, Clintons\u2019 career was coming full circle to where it began more than 40 years ago, in 1974, when Hillary Rodham, as she was then known\u2014a newly minted graduate of Yale Law School\u2014joined the staff of the House Judiciary Committee that was preparing to impeach Richard Nixon for Watergate. The collection of lawyers employed by Peter Rodino, a Democrat from New Jersey\u2014William Weld, who became a Republican governor of Massachusetts; Bernard Nussbaum, who became White House counsel to President Bill Clinton; Robert Sack and Pierre Leval, who both eventually served on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; and John Doar, a hero of the legal fight against segregation\u2014may have been the greatest assembly of legal talent since Daniel Webster dined alone.\n\nNixon\u2019s resignation in response to that onslaught by a Congress controlled by an opposing party provided a precedent so dramatic that succeeding Congresses were tempted to attempt to repeat it, regardless of whether the crimes of the presidents who followed came anywhere near Nixon\u2019s. Thus, Reagan was subjected to the Iran-Contra hearings. Bill Clinton endured the Whitewater investigations of Rep. Dan Burton and Senator Alfonse D\u2019Amato. And President Obama\u2019s secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who back in Nixon\u2019s day was a congressional lawyer-investigator herself, now finds herself on the receiving end of congressional inquiries.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only sense in which the Benghazi hearings amount to a kind of poetic justice. Some Democrats\u2014and Donald Trump\u2014blame George W. Bush, rather than the Islamist terrorists, for the deaths on September 11, 2001. It\u2019s just as illogical to blame Clinton\u2014rather than the Islamist terrorists\u2014for the deaths at Benghazi.\n\nJust because both sides do it doesn\u2019t make it right. Not for nothing did Rep. Kevin McCarthy find himself out of the running for Speaker of the House immediately after committing the gaffe of boasting about the effect the Benghazi committee has had in driving down Hillary Clinton\u2019s poll numbers.\n\nThe best substantive defense of the Benghazi hearings that I have seen was by Elliott Abrams, who was writing on the web site of the Council on Foreign Relations. Abrams served in the State Department and at the National Security Council during the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations and also on the staffs of Democratic Senators Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson and Daniel Patrick Moynihan (he was pardoned by George H.W. Bush after a misdemeanor guilty plea related to Iran-Contra). Abrams focuses on the failure of requests for additional security from the American ambassador in Libya, Chris Stevens, to reach Clinton. \"She was exchanging emails on Libya with Sidney Blumenthal\u2014but not with Chris Stevens,\" Abrams writes. \"Putting politics aside that is a bureaucratic failure, an indictment of the management and information system she established in the Department.\"\n\nMaybe so. Yet the Republican Party\u2019s management of its legislative business and leadership succession in Congress isn\u2019t exactly a shining case study in deftness, either.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder that after all these years of blame-casting, gotcha politics, recrimination, and the attempted criminalization of policy differences, voters are looking to fresh faces without a lot of Washington experience. What is the prize for a Ben Carson or a Donald Trump or a Marco Rubio who wins the presidency? Being the next to reap the bitter harvest planted by young Hillary Rodham and her colleagues on the Watergate Committee so long ago.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The Benghazi hearings amount to a kind of poetic justice.", "title": "Benghazi Circus Was Born in Hillary's Watergate Past", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/10/26/benghazi-circus-poetic-justice", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1445886001996.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/1445886001996.jpg", "description": "The Benghazi hearings amount to a kind of poetic justice.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Benghazi Circus Was Born in Hillary's Watergate Past"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-10-26T20:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/ira-stoll"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s not the only sense in which the Benghazi hearings amount to a kind of poetic justice.\nThe best substantive defense of the Benghazi hearings that I have seen was by Elliott Abrams, who was writing on the web site of the Council on Foreign Relations.\nIt\u2019s just as illogical to blame Clinton\u2014rather than the Islamist terrorists\u2014for the deaths at Benghazi.\nBeing the next to reap the bitter harvest planted by young Hillary Rodham and her colleagues on the Watergate Committee so long ago.\nAnd President Obama\u2019s secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, who back in Nixon\u2019s day was a congressional lawyer-investigator herself, now finds herself on the receiving end of congressional inquiries."}
