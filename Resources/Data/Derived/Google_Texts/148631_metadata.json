Instead of potato, cheese or sauerkraut, Kaczor stuffs these with apple, lemon, blueberry, even chocolate. And after a light dusting with powdered sugar, pierogi is reminiscent of a puff pastry and a funnel cake.\n\nAfter passing out samples at a Glassport grocery store earlier this year, Kaczor had another eureka moment. He wasn't far from Kennywood \u2014 a place big on fun food, in an area rich with ethnic food tradition.\n\n\u201cThat's right in the heart of pierogi country,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere I really needed to be.\u201d\n\nKaczor made an appointment with the West Mifflin park. In April, he met with food service management, who greeted him, fryers at the ready.\n\n\u201cOne bite out of it and they were like, \u2018this is a really good product for the park,' \u201d Kaczor said.\n\nKennywood introduced the fruit-filled pierogi in May, selling them at the funnel cake stand near the Log Jammer.\n\nFor $5.25, guests get three pierogi with their choice of filling. The deep-fried treats can be ordered plain or topped with strawberries and ice cream.\n\nIf Kennywood deems them a success, it's likely the dessert dumplings will return next summer.\n\nThe menu item is catching on, according to Mike Henninger, the park's food service director.\n\n\u201cIt's something unique you don't see at a lot of places,\u201d Henninger said. \u201cIt fits really well with Pittsburgh.\u201d\n\nFor 50-year-old Kaczor, the road to Kennywood \u2014 and full-time pasta production \u2014 has proved as interesting as any of the amusement park's rides.\n\nHe founded his company in 2011, selling ravioli, gnocchi and pierogi at local festivals, for fundraisers and at area grocery stores.\n\nHis Italian mother taught him how to make ravioli when he was a teen. For years, Kaczor crafted homemade pasta for holidays and special occasions, often with the help of his wife, Marsha, and their friends. He worked at Key Bellevilles near Leechburg for years, but always dreamed of entering the pasta business.\n\n\u201cI was always still wanting to do my ravioli gig, you know?\u201d he said.\n\nHe took the chance three years ago when a coworker scoffed at his dream.\n\nKaczor went home that night and put $6,000 down on an Italian-made ravioli machine. Two years later, he left Key Bellevilles behind.\n\nNow he's working out of the same kitchen where his mother taught him to make ravioli. Half of the duplex is his headquarters, while 92-year-old Ann Kaczor makes her home on the other side.\n\nAnn said she always knew her son would be a successful business owner, but didn't realize he'd do so using her meat ravioli recipe.\n\n\u201cHe was just a young boy, not even a teen, yet talking about his own business,\u201d she said.\n\nShe credits his father, Stanley, with instilling in their children a sense of perfectionism and a solid work ethic.\n\nShe said she's proud he's using her meat ravioli recipe, along with the pierogi with potato and cheese that he learned from a Polish aunt.\n\nTaken together, it seems Kaczor's family instilled in him a recipe for success.\n\n\u201cI'm doing what my dad taught me to do, be an independent thinker and don't back down,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what I bring to the table.\u201d\n\nJulie E.
