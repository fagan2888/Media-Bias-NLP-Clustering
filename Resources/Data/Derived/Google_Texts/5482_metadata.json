Marco Rubio (R-FL) seemingly opted for responsible fiscal policy over smart politics in Thursday night\u2019s Republican presidential debate in Miami.\n\nWhile Republican frontrunner Donald Trump pandered to millions of seniors in the Sunshine State by declaring that Social Security reform would be off-limits in a Trump administration, Rubio under sharp questioning by a CNN moderator spelled out his plan to avert the long-term bankruptcy of the national retirement program while exempting current retirees from the effects of his cuts.\n\nRelated: This Is What the GOP\u2019s Surrender to Trump Looks Like\n\nSocial Security has long been known as the Third Rail of Politics \u2013 touch it and you die. Spending last year on Social Security benefits totaled $877 billion, or nearly a quarter of all federal spending. The Congressional Budget Office projects that \u2013absent significant changes in policy \u2013 the Social Security retirement and disability insurance funds taken together will be exhausted in 2029, requiring a 29 percent reduction in benefits from the scheduled amounts.\n\nMany seniors\u2019 advocacy organizations and liberal Democrats take a hard line against any tampering with the program \u2013 whether in the short-term or long term. And Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the Democratic presidential candidate, is pushing for a major expansion of Social Security benefits financed by an increase in the federal payroll tax.\n\n\u201cI will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security \u2013 to leave it the way it is, to make this country rich again, to bring back our jobs, to get rid of deficits, to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country,\u201d Trump said during the debate.\n\nTrump has spouted this nonsense before that he could slow the growth of the national debt by eliminating waste, fraud and abuse in Social Security and other spending programs without changing the basic benefits structure or retirement age. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget notes, however, that even if the Social Security system could stop all improper payments, that would save only $3 billion of the $150 billion of savings that will be required in the coming decade to render Social Security solvent.\n\nRelated: Thousands of Defense Jobs Could Be Lost If Trump Gets Elected\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is we can\u2019t just continue to tiptoe around this and throw out things like, \u2018I\u2019m going to get at fraud and abuse,\u2019\u201d Rubio said last night. \u201cYou still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you\u2019re going to have to make up. And here\u2019s the thing: If we do not do it, we will have a debt crisis.\u201d\n\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich echoed Rubio\u2019s concerns about the need to address the long-term threat of Social Security insolvency. \u201cSocial Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it\u2019s irresponsible,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAnd any politician that doesn\u2019t step forward and address it is not being a real leader.\u201d\n\nRubio for months has called for reforms to slow the growth of Social Security spending\u2014including forcing younger people to work longer before they can qualify for benefits, but until last night, he was vague as to the specifics. About one in five Florida residents \u2013 or about four million people \u2013 receive retirement benefits, and survivors and disability insurance through Social Security.\n\nUnder the current law, the retirement age for full Social Security benefits is 67 for people born in 1960 and thereafter. People who retire earlier receive lower benefits.\n\nRelated: Rubio, Now a Zombie Candidate, Under Pressure to Quit\n\nUnder questioning by CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, the 44-year-old Rubio said, \u201cSomeone my age would retire at 68 . . . We'd allow the retirement age to increase until it hits 70, so my children would retire at 70.\"\n\nRubio has also said he would slow the rate of growth of benefits for wealthier seniors and abolish the retirement earnings test, which he complains discourages older Americans to keep on working while doing nothing to address the long-term solvency of Social Security.\n\nRubio says he would also open up the federal Thrift Savings Plans to non-government workers. That program is similar to a 401 (k) program and invests in an array of stock and bond mutual funds, and not merely the types of government bonds held by the Social Security Administration.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton are vowing to protect and even expand on existing Social Security benefits and dismiss calls for reforms as an unwarranted conservative attack on a program that serves as a lifeline for many middle- and lower income senior citizens.\n\nRelated: Democrats Promise to Expand Social Security Regardless of the Risk\n\nSanders has called for increasing benefits by an average of $65 a month, beefing up cost-of-living adjustments and boosting the minimum benefits for low-income seniors. He would finance these expanded benefits while keeping the program solvent for another 50 years by raising the amount of earnings that are subject to the federal payroll tax that supports Social Security.\n\nFor her part, Clinton would preserve the existing system by requiring the wealthiest seniors to contribute more \u2013 although she provides no real details on how she would go about doing that. Clinton has said she would also favor expanding benefits for widows and for people who took time off from their jobs to care for their children or for sick family members.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "As he desperately seeks a victory next week in Florida\u2019s critical GOP primary, Sen.", "title": "Rubio Confronts Long-Term Debt Crisis Calling for Social Security Reform", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/11/Rubio-Confronts-Long-Term-Debt-Crisis-Calling-Social-Security-Reform", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-rubio_4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/03/11/Rubio-Confronts-Long-Term-Debt-Crisis-Calling-Social-Security-Reform", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-rubio_4.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "As he desperately seeks a victory next week in Florida\u2019s critical GOP primary, Sen.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "John Kasich echoed Rubio\u2019s concerns about the need to address the long-term threat of Social Security insolvency.\nSpending last year on Social Security benefits totaled $877 billion, or nearly a quarter of all federal spending.\nUnder the current law, the retirement age for full Social Security benefits is 67 for people born in 1960 and thereafter.\nAbout one in five Florida residents \u2013 or about four million people \u2013 receive retirement benefits, and survivors and disability insurance through Social Security.\n\u201cSocial Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it\u2019s irresponsible,\u201d Cruz said."}
