On Friday night, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow appeared on Late Night with Seth Meyers and offered a sobering assessment of the Democrats’ chances of holding on to the Senate in the midterm elections this fall.

Maddow suggested that if Democrats are going to try to distance themselves from the White House and President Barack Obama’s achievements, then maybe they deserve to lose.

For instance, she said, Democrats are not touting the success of the Affordable Care Act and the fact that none of the dire predictions Republicans made about Obamacare have come true.

“So, Republicans spent the last, hmmm, six years decrying Obamacare as the end of the world,” said Maddow. “Now we have Obamacare. It’s kind of working. Costs are down, lots of people signed up, sky didn’t fall. Literally, it’s working the way it’s supposed to. Millions of people have health care who didn’t have it before. Working.”

“So,” she went on, “the Republicans’ reason for living has just disappeared. The main thing they like to talk about, they can no longer talk about.”

“If your opponent loses the thing that they’ve been using as a crutch for six years and you just let them walk away from it like it never existed, maybe you don’t deserve to win,” said Maddow. “They just don’t have the killer instinct it takes to make their opponents pay for a big mistake and I don’t understand why the Democrats are doing that.”
