As robotic surgical systems moved through research and testing, many doctors hoped the new technology would double down on those advances.\n\nThe companies building surgical robots were certainly optimistic. In product names like Zeus, Aesop, and da Vinci, one can hear great humanitarian aspirations.\n\nZeus and Aesop were slain by da Vinci, whose Silicon Valley manufacturer, Intuitive Surgical, bought the company that made them and scrapped the projects. But many of those hopes still hang on da Vinci, which was first approved for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000.\n\nThe da Vinci surgical system continues to be the shiny new toy that hospitals and private surgical practices boast about on billboards and websites. The system doesn\u2019t resemble a robot so much as a video game: The surgeon sits comfortably behind a screen and looks at a magnified view of the surgical site while operating the machine\u2019s robotic arms.\n\nThe robotic arms can ostensibly get into hard-to-reach places, promising patients less bleeding, faster recovery, less chance of damage to important nerves, and smaller scars than traditional surgeries.\n\nDa Vinci\u2019s price tag partly explains why buyers might want to brag: A single robot costs about $2 million. Some of the attachments that go on the arms are disposable, and their sole manufacturer is Intuitive. Robotic surgery generally costs as much as $3,500 more than a comparable laparoscopic operation.\n\nSo is this the brave new world of medicine or an expensive boondoggle?\n\n\u2018A Solution in Search of a Problem\u2019\n\nOne thing is certain: The da Vinci hasn\u2019t improved patient outcomes as dramatically as the first wave of minimally invasive surgery did. A decade into its use, the laparoscope had proven that patients fared better with its smaller incisions than they did with \u201copen\u201d surgeries, or those that require a large incision.\n\n\u201cAs laparoscopic surgery has continued to succeed, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a person on the planet who would have an open operation. And that\u2019s only over 20 years or so, so that\u2019s a rapid shift,\u201d said Dr. Jay Redan, the president of the Board of Trustees of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons and a charter member of the Society of Robotic Surgery.\n\nFifteen years into use of the da Vinci system, evidence that it trumps other methods is lacking.\n\nThe ECRI Institute, a nonprofit organization that synthesizes data on medical procedures, drugs, and devices to support hospitals and doctors in creating quality protocols, has analyzed more than 4,000 studies on robotic surgery.\n\n\u201cThe evidence isn\u2019t strong enough to determine whether or not a robot is better than traditional minimally invasive surgery, but the evidence does indicate that it\u2019s better compared to open surgery \u2014 more evidence from higher quality studies may change this conclusion,\u201d said Chris Schabowsky, Ph.D., a program manager at ECRI.\n\nTo justify its price \u2014 roughly ten times that of a high-end laparoscope \u2014 da Vinci would need to do a lot better overall.\n\n\u201cThis is a technology that is costing the healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars and has been marketed as a miracle \u2014 and it\u2019s not,\u201d said Dr. John Santa, medical director at Consumer Reports Health. \u201cIt\u2019s a fancier way of doing what we\u2019ve always been able to do.\u201d\n\nThis is a technology that is costing the healthcare system hundreds of millions of dollars and has been marketed as a miracle \u2014 and it\u2019s not. Dr. John Santa, Consumer Reports Health\n\nDa Vinci was originally designed to do cardiovascular surgery, but it\u2019s fallen out of favor for heart surgeries. Next it was picked up for gynecological surgeries. In 2013, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said it wasn\u2019t the best or even the second-best option for non-cancerous gynecological surgeries. Some critics called the da Vinci a \u201csolution in search of a problem.\u201d\n\nDa Vinci finally hit its groove in urology. Prostate removals were difficult to do laparoscopically, and many surgeons continued to use open incisions. The da Vinci made it easier to do minimally invasive prostatectomies. Nearly 90 percent of these surgeries are now done robotically.\n\nPatients lose less blood, but in the measurements that count most \u2014 how likely they are to be impotent or incontinent after surgery \u2014 the robot is no better than open surgery.\n\nThere are horror stories about robotic surgeries gone awry found in the pages of thousands of lawsuits. But experts interviewed by Healthline lay the blame for these negative outcomes at the surgeons\u2019 feet, not at the robot\u2019s. Whenever a new technique enters the operating room, some doctors make mistakes with it. They are, after all, only human.\n\n\u201cWhen [laparoscopic surgery] was introduced, there was a spike in patient complications. That was because, in general, the surgical field was getting trained; there were errors, there were mistakes. Now fast-forward, this is just kind of par for course when it comes to introducing a disruptor. You\u2019re going to run into these issues,\u201d said the ECRI Institute\u2019s Schabowsky.\n\nThe key is for patients to minimize their chances of being one of the mistakes by ensuring their surgeons have ample experience with any device they plan to use in the OR. That information can be hard to get, the experts agreed \u2014 only cardiac surgeons currently make such records available to the public.\n\nBut consumers aren\u2019t doing their part, either.\n\nDude, Where\u2019s My Robot?\n\nAmerican consumers want the newest, shiniest thing in the operating room as much as they do in the living room.\n\n\u201cAmericans tend to think that the latest and greatest technology has got to be better, and it\u2019s not in this case,\u201d said Santa, of Consumer Reports Health.\n\nIntuitive has greased the wheels by undertaking direct-to-consumer marketing for its robots. As a result, patients often demand robotic surgery, doctors said. (Intuitive declined Healthline\u2019s requests for an interview.)\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many patients come in who say, \u2018I want robotic surgery with a laser\u2019 \u2014 and they\u2019ll find somebody to do that,\u201d said Dr. Eric Genden an ear, nose, and throat surgeon at the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. \u201cThis is a beautiful illustration of how American medicine and the patients tend to become enamored of technology without ever really asking the question, \u2018What are we getting for the technology?\u2019\u201d\n\nRedan agreed.\n\n\u201cPatients will go to someone who has the robot because it\u2019s been marketed so much,\u201d he said.\n\nHospitals advertise their da Vinci machines in part as a response to perceived consumer demand. They see the robots as a way to bring more patients through their glass doors rather than their competitors\u2019, studies have shown. But hospital advertisements also help drive the perception that robots make the best surgeons.\n\nOne study of how hospitals talk about robotic surgery found that many copied directly from Intuitive\u2019s marketing materials. Only a minority pointed to potential risks. Unlike doctors and drug companies, hospitals aren\u2019t required to disclose risks in their advertising.\n\nMarketing has played such a big part in drumming up demand for da Vinci machines that one surgeon who has developed a substantial online following under the pen name Skeptical Scalpel concluded in a blog post on robotic surgery that, \u201cThe decline of medicine as a profession began when it became legal for doctors and hospitals to advertise.\u201d\n\nDr. Fabrizio Michelassi, the chair of the department of surgery at Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York and chair of the board of governors of the American College of Surgeons, said surgeons are obligated to educate their patients on what the evidence says are the pros and cons of robotic surgery.\n\n\u201cUnless we inform the patient population on this, there will be a drive from the consumer that trumps everything else, because at that point hospitals and physicians are caught in a difficult dilemma,\u201d Michelassi said. \u201cHospitals and physicians are caught in the dilemma to either continue to deliver optimal care or to respond to market requests.\u201d\n\nBalance Is Due\n\nThe irony is that hospitals lose money on robotic surgeries because insurance companies reimburse all minimally invasive surgeries, whether laparoscopic or robotic, at the same rates.\n\nDr. Richard Newman, a pancreatic and endocrine surgeon at Saint Francis Medical Group in Hartford, Connecticut, researched the cost-effectiveness of the da Vinci by pairing cases of gallbladder removal with identical outcomes, one laparoscopic, one robotic. He found that the robotic surgeries cost three times more.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good deal for the hospitals,\u201d he said. \u201cThe administrators that are in place have been in a very volume-driven field, where if the competition across town gets one, you get one.\u201d\n\nHospitals do seem to recoup the cost of the robots through volume.\n\nOne way is by using the machine as much as possible. Several doctors uncomfortably confirmed that hospital administrators, who are the gatekeepers for their rooms, staff, and equipment, are inclined to okay robotic surgeries to defray the cost of the multimillion-dollar machines.\n\nThe ECRI Institute ranks robotic surgery among its top 10 healthcare hazards for 2015; it appeared on the same list in 2014. ECRI doesn\u2019t fault the device. Instead, it points to inadequate certification requirements at the hospitals that use it. The group is pushing hospitals to develop appropriate processes for approving doctors to use the robotic systems.\n\nSome hospitals may require a surgeon to perform three robotic surgeries before giving him or her the okay to operate on a patient with a robot; others may require 50 or 100 operations. Hospital policies are not routinely disclosed to the public.\n\n\u201cYou do three robotic cases and you\u2019re credentialed,\u201d Redan said, by way of example. \u201cBut people spend a year in their fellowships learning how to do conventional surgeries.\u201d\n\nIn some of the lawsuits pending against Intuitive, some plaintiffs claim that the company lobbies hospitals to ease their so-called credentialing requirements to allow more doctors to use the machines.\n\nIntuitive has expanded the training it offers doctors to get them started. But many still think it\u2019s not enough. Although device manufacturers aren\u2019t required to train doctors on their equipment, experts say Intuitive has done more to push patient demand than to train surgeons.\n\n\u201c[Intuitive\u2019s] direct-to-consumer marketing is just criminal. Their lack of training, in my opinion it borders on criminal. Dr. Eric Genden, the Mount Sinai Hospital\n\n\u201cIntuitive are probably the worst at doing this and probably the most responsible. Their direct-to-consumer marketing is just criminal. Their lack of training, in my opinion it borders on criminal,\u201d said Genden.\n\nIntuitive has also continued to push into new surgical departments, making the case most recently that da Vinci works well for head and neck surgery and even the open, and usually relatively low-cost, category of general surgery.\n\nFor example, based on his experience using the da Vinci, Mount Sinai's Genden said it had been a boon for trans-oral surgeries to remove tumors in the throat, shaving hours off the operating time \u2014 which correlates with lower patient risk, Genden said.\n\nBut rather than stop there, Intuitive has pushed for the da Vinci to be used for thyroid removal. Although thyroidectomy is generally done with an open incision, the robotic procedure took significantly longer and didn\u2019t give better results, Genden added.\n\nThe Mount Sinai Hospital does not offer robotic thyroidectomies. But here\u2019s what Intuitive had to say about the procedure in its 2013 annual report, the most recent one available: \u201cOpen surgery is an effective surgery in terms of oncologic control and has low complication rates. However, it leaves a prominent neck scar. Surgeons, predominantly in Asia, are now using the da Vinci Surgical System to perform thyroidectomies entering the body from the axilla (armpit) in order to avoid the visible scar on the neck.\u201d\n\nIntuitive is hardly unique in its efforts to find new uses for its product, said Santa, of Consumer Reports Health.\n\n\u201cIt highlights another problem in our system, which is oftentimes nobody\u2019s happy confining something to a fairly narrow corridor. They want to make as much money as they can off of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see this with drugs, we see this with devices, that if it works for A, B, and C, let\u2019s try it for D.\u201d\n\nMount Sinai's Dr. Genden prepares the da Vinci robot.\n\nDa Vinci is both a cause and a symptom of a U.S. healthcare system that costs far more than comparable systems in other countries without offering better results.\n\nRelated News: Men Still Overtreated for Prostate Cancer \u00bb\n\nThere\u2019s some evidence that among consumers, who may see surgery under the care of an unerring robot as less scary, and hospitals, pressured to recoup the costs of the robot, the result may be surgeries in cases where they\u2019re not entirely necessary.\n\nAs robotic surgery has become the most common way to do prostatectomies, the number of these surgeries has risen against a backdrop of medical guidance that increasingly identifies the best way to treat prostate cancer as \u201cwatch and wait.\u201d\n\nDr. Quoc-Dien Trinh, a Harvard urologist who uses the da Vinci, was reluctant to conclude that people who don\u2019t need surgery are getting surgery. But the data nevertheless points in that direction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to incriminate the individual, but if you look at general trends in the population, that\u2019s what it shows. These new technologies have always disseminated mostly in low-risk populations,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated News: U.S. Healthcare Is the Worst Among Developed Countries \u00bb\n\nRedan has an idea of how to rein it all in.\n\n\u201cCurrently, I think robots should just be used in certain centers of excellence where they are evaluating the efficacy, efficiency, and economics of this type of surgery,\u201d he said.\n\nBureaucrats to the Rescue?\n\nThere\u2019s another possible hero in 21st century medicine, though it\u2019s far less sexy than a robotic surgeon: the beleaguered Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe law establishes a new compensation model, called Accountable Care Organizations, that rewards doctors and hospitals for good results. Part of that effort includes pushing Medicare-certified hospitals to publicize information on how their patients fare. Many hope that medical professional groups will follow suit.\n\nThat information would let patients have more informed conversations about whether to undergo robotic surgery.\n\nAccountable care is a radical shift from the status quo, in which doctors are paid based on the volume of care they provide. Few hospitals or doctors are sure exactly how it will work yet. But doctors are increasingly evaluating care in terms of value, defined as the quality of the medical outcome divided by the cost of treatment.\n\nThat approach will put the squeeze on high-cost procedures, like robotic surgery, that don\u2019t demonstrate any big advantages over cheaper alternatives.\n\n\u201cIf you do the same equation of outcome divided by cost, you\u2019ve got to get a really better outcome to justify the cost, because the cost is immense,\u201d said Michelassi of the American College of Surgeons.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s also possible that technological innovation will prevail in the end. The da Vinci could get even shinier and more high-tech, or it could hit upon a new innovation that will deliver on its promises to send patients home sooner with better long-term results.\n\n\u201cI remember when we started to perform laparoscopic surgery, the instrumentation was very rough. Now, 25 years later, there is no question that some operations are easier laparoscopically than open, but for a while then every operation was more difficult laparoscopically. Maybe the da Vinci platform will continue to evolve to a point of becoming much more affordable or offering major advantages over other surgical approaches,\u201d Michelassi said.\n\nWe\u2019re just not there yet.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgical systems, Intuitive Surgical, da vinci, da vinci surgical system, Board of Trustees of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons, Society of Robotic Surgery, ECRI Institute, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists", "og": {"site_name": "Healthline", "description": "A robotic surgeon with tiny lights, tiny cameras, and steady hands sounds like a miracle of technology.
