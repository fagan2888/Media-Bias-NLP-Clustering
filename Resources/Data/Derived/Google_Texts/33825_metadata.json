The former adjoins the 160-guest-room Prescott Resort and Conference Center situated on \"Top of the Rock\" of Prescott, Arizona's \"Mile High City\". The existing resort offers stunning views of the town and the nation's largest continuous forest of Ponderosa pines. Free \"Gold Rush\" express shuttle buses run daily from Phoenix, located less than 100 miles southeast of Prescott. Other tribal enterprises include a 250-acre shopping center, Frontier Village, featuring a large collection of national brands, and Sundog Business Park, located just two minutes from Prescott and housing more than a dozen industrial office businesses. Of the approximately 150 enrolled members of the Yavapai-Prescott tribe, 115 live on the reservation.\n\nThe tribe's newest endeavor is slated for a 12-acre site along the main highway, Arizona 69, at the intersection of the Yavpe Connector. The tribe anticipates a late 2016 opening.\n\nA formal press conference made the rumors official on Saturday, April 5. Tribal General Manager Rich Marcum has confirmed the basics with Indian Country Today Media Network: the as-yet-unnamed lodging and gaming site will offer 50,000 square feet of casino space and up to 80 hotel rooms.\n\n\u201cAt this point, we don\u2019t know what we\u2019ll call it or what the design will look like,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re planning a strategic focus group for tribal member input and we have the summer to determine those details. The next milestone will be an architect\u2019s rendering expected in late June. The tribe has long wanted a more modern hotel destination to replace the aging Bucky\u2019s and Yavapai casinos; and with other tribes building \u201cresort-style\u201d properties, they felt the time for them to build was now.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Yavapai College Regional Economic Development Center study, the new casino will be an economic boon for the growing Prescott Valley. \u201cFor this project, it worked out to an $80 million impact to the region over the next 18-24 months,\u201d said Marcum. That figure reflects direct and indirect benefits of the project cost as well as related increased spending in the local economy.\n\nThe 99-year-old Leo A. Daly architecture, engineering and interior design firm will lead construction and development of the project.\n\nThe destination hotel and gaming facility is intended to attract new customers from outside the region, in addition to local gamers. The new casino will feature several restaurants serving a variety of cuisines, a central bar, and flexible event space to accommodate a variety of entertainment events.\n\nAccording to the Arizona Department of Gaming, the state\u2019s gaming compact with the Yavapai-Prescott tribe allows for 566 slot machines and 90 card tables. The existing Bucky\u2019s Casino has 309 slots, 11 poker tables and half a dozen blackjack tables, while Yavapai Casino offers 244 slots. Early information indicates the operations of the two, current facilities will be consolidated in some fashion, temporarily, and Marcum has been quoted as saying that once the new hotel is open sometime in 2016, the two older casinos will close.\n\n\u201cJobwise, there will be an offset,\u201d said Marcum. \u201cThere will be some downsizing through attrition during the consolidation phase with job increases expected on the hotel-side of the new casino. Overall we expect little or no job loss and only small employment gains, perhaps 20 to 30 employees.\u201d\n\nThe modernization of the resort is expected to generate more revenue. \u201cWe estimate, conservatively, that casino revenues will increase between 10-15 percent over current volume,\u201d Marcum said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The worst-kept gaming secret among Arizona's tiny Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe has been confirmed: There\u2019s a new destination, resor", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "klb678", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/05/buzz-about-arizonas-newest-casino-resort-154327", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/hwy69yavpeconnector.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "The Buzz About Arizona's Newest Casino Resort"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-04-05T11:28-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/04/05/buzz-about-arizonas-newest-casino-resort-154327", "dc": {"title": "The Buzz About Arizona's Newest Casino Resort"}, "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.title": "The Buzz About Arizona's Newest Casino Resort"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbda0\"", "article_summary": "The 1,400-acre reservation in central Yavapai County, Arizona, is adjacent to Prescott, which is already home to two facilities: Bucky\u2019s Casino and Yavapai Casino.\nThe existing Bucky\u2019s Casino has 309 slots, 11 poker tables and half a dozen blackjack tables, while Yavapai Casino offers 244 slots.\nThe worst-kept gaming secret among Arizona's tiny Yavapai-Prescott Indian Tribe has been confirmed: There\u2019s a new destination, resort-style casino on the drawing boards.\nOf the approximately 150 enrolled members of the Yavapai-Prescott tribe, 115 live on the reservation.\nThe former adjoins the 160-guest-room Prescott Resort and Conference Center situated on \"Top of the Rock\" of Prescott, Arizona's \"Mile High City\"."}
