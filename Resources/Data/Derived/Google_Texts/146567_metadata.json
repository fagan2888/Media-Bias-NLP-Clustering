That\u2019s what Democrats and their media parrots keep saying. Except that it isn\u2019t, and the same people who rammed through the law want to \u201cfix\u201d it:\n\nWith millions more covered, Democrats see high deductibles, copays as next health care issue. http://t.co/Ue7S344KSN \u2014 AP Politics (@AP_Politics) May 23, 2015\n\nIn that article, the AP didn\u2019t seem too interested in pointing out the irony of the Democrats scrambling to fix problems they created.\n\nIt\u2019s referred to as \u201cskimpy insurance.\u201d You know what that means the \u201csolution\u201d will be:\n\ni.e. 'More money' https://t.co/Z8ZqDhUhKk \u2014 Bob \u0646 (@BobHicks_) May 23, 2015\n\nDing! Ding! Unbelievable. The \u201cAffordable\u201d Care Act is unaffordable and short on \u201ccare\u201d:\n\nAfter paying premiums, many low- and middle-income patients still face high costs when trying to use their coverage. There\u2019s growing concern that the value of a health insurance card is being eaten away by rising deductibles, the amount of actual medical costs that patients pay each year before coverage kicks in. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be the next big problem,\u201d said Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., a congressional leader on health care. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some 17 million more people covered \u2026 but they can\u2019t access the care they seem to be entitled to,\u201d McDermott said. \u201cIt costs too much to use the care. That\u2019s the deceptive part about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeceptive\u201d is right \u2014 and that\u2019s from a congressman who voted for it. But other than that, the law\u2019s working great!\n\nSo who\u2019s up for letting the same people who created the problem provide the \u201cfix\u201d?\n\nWhy is this a problem? It\u2019s called the AFFORDABLE Care Act. https://t.co/kay8UvEklt \u2014 Jay Caruso (@JayCaruso) May 23, 2015\n\n@AP_Politics @AP Jeez, you're not just carrying water for the left. You're changing their bedpans and wiping their asses too. Pathetic. \u2014 Gary Eaton (@garysteveneaton) May 23, 2015\n\n@AP_Politics @AP as \"next\" issue? Our premiums doubled while our coverage shrank. Thanks! \u2014 Kyle Jordan (@kj_106) May 23, 2015\n\n@AP_Politics @AP underinsurance? really? Dems & Obama had no idea what was in the law when they voted to pass, now won't admit we're screwed \u2014 David Gritts (@dlgritts) May 23, 2015\n\n@AP_Politics @AP @TheDemocrats how about exorbitant premiums? \u2014 TB (@tbagnulo) May 23, 2015\n\n#killing #families #costofcare15 can't afford to be treated. I'd be better off making less & having government help. https://t.co/8mdtS5F8kS \u2014 Kelly C.
