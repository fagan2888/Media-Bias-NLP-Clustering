Coming up tonight at 9, Piers Morgan opens his New York studio for a very special edition of his primetime program, one that he aptly calls "Three Generations of Buffett."

With business tycoon Warren Buffett sitting by his son, Howard Graham Buffett, and his grandson Howard Warren Buffett, talk turns to technology, and the "Piers Morgan Live" host encourages the Buffett patriarch to produce his cell phone.

"This is the one Alexander Graham Bell gave me," jokes Buffett, as he reveals a Nokia flip phone, a relic as compared to today's smart phones. "I don't throw anything away until I've had it 20 or 25 years."

Switching from mobile to mail, Morgan asks his guest about the land of InBoxes and Spam.

"I sent one e-mail in my life," reveals Warren Buffett. "I sent it to Jeff Raikes at Microsoft and it ended up in court in Minneapolis, so I am one for one."

Whether its automobiles, phones, computers, or property, Buffett insists against the excessive collection of material goods:

"I have everything I want. I'm happy."

Watch the clip for more of Morgan's conversation with the Buffetts, including the tale of Howard Warren Buffett's childhood farm and car loan, and for the next edition of "Piers Morgan Live," watch CNN every night at 9.
