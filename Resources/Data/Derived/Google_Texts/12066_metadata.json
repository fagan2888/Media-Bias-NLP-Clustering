The survey, released on April 1st, but apparently not as an April Fool\u2019s joke, shows Ted Cruz gaining ground on the leaders, and sitting in a strong third place position for the Republican nomination. His presidential announcement speech at Liberty University appears to have resonated with Republican voters.\n\nCruz has surged from 5 percent support a little over a month ago, to 16 percent now. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker still leads with 20 percent support. Jeb Bush is in second at 17 percent and Ted Cruz is at 16 percent. Ben Carson and Rand Paul sit at 10 percent each. Four other candidates (Marco Rubio, Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie, and Rick Perry) remain mired in the single digits.\n\nWith Republican Party voters, Ted Cruz is popular. 52 percent of GOP voters have a favorable opinion of Senator Cruz, to just 30 percent who view him unfavorably. His support is especially strong with Republicans who identify themselves as Tea Party supporters. With Tea Party Republicans, Cruz enjoys a 74 percent favorable rating to 21 percent unfavorable rating.\n\nIt would be very easy to dismiss Senator Cruz\u2019s candidacy as a joke, given his penchant for outlandish remarks, and impractical proposals like abolishing the IRS and repealing every single word of Obamacare. However, his particular brand of madness seems to have attracted him new supporters from within the ranks of the GOP electorate.\n\nPolling consistently shows that Republican voters are not warming up to Jeb Bush\u2019s candidacy. GOP primary voters are seeking a more conservative alternative who will give voice to their radical right-wing perspectives, informed as they are by talk radio hosts and the 24/7 bash Obama cycle over at FOX News.\n\nSenator Cruz has tapped into Republican resentment, stoking the politics of rage to fuel his campaign. Whether or not his polling surge is but a temporary bump, or a more permanent boost that could make him a threat to seize the Republican nomination, remains to be seen. But one thing is now clear. Ted Cruz\u2019s policy prescriptions may still be a joke, but his candidacy no longer is. America had better be ready because if Senator Cruz\u2019s momentum continues to grow, the Republican primary could descend into madness, dragging the whole country along for the ride.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A PPP poll shows Ted Cruz pulling into contention with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Keith Brekhus", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "A PPP poll shows Ted Cruz pulling into contention with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.", "title": "GOP Descends Into Madness As Ted Cruz Vaults Into Top Tier Of 2016 GOP Candidates", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/04/01/gop-descends-madness-ted-cruz-vaults-top-tier-2016-gop-candidates.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ted-cruz-smarmy.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-01T20:26:02+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Elections,Featured News,Republican Party,White House,Ben Carson,Chris Christie,GOP Primary,Internal Revenue Service,Jeb Bush,liberty university,Marco Rubio,Mike Huckabee,Political Endorsement,Rand Paul,Republicans,Rick Perry,scott walker,Tea Party,Ted Cruz,Voting Result,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "White House", "published_time": "2015-04-01T20:26:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-01T20:26:02+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Ben Carson, Chris Christie, GOP Primary, Internal Revenue Service, Jeb Bush, liberty university, Marco Rubio, Mike Huckabee, Political Endorsement, Rand Paul, Republican Party, Republicans, Rick Perry, scott walker, Tea Party, Ted Cruz, Voting Result"}, "article_summary": "With Republican Party voters, Ted Cruz is popular.\n52 percent of GOP voters have a favorable opinion of Senator Cruz, to just 30 percent who view him unfavorably.\nJeb Bush is in second at 17 percent and Ted Cruz is at 16 percent.\nHis presidential announcement speech at Liberty University appears to have resonated with Republican voters.\nSenator Cruz has tapped into Republican resentment, stoking the politics of rage to fuel his campaign."}
