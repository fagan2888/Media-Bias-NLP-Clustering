Participants in the programs are more likely to smoke, she said, and copays can be a barrier to getting help.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very busy time of year for quitting,\u201d Mason said.\n\nFor the past 10 years, the state\u2019s Department of Human Services has covered smoke cessation medications and services in public health insurance programs, said Nathan Moracco, an assistant commissioner.\n\nWith the new policy, enrollees won\u2019t be charged medication copays of $1 to $3 in Medicaid, and $3 per prescription in MinnesotaCare.\n\nMedicaid provides health insurance to people at or below the poverty line, while MinnesotaCare covers a slightly higher-income group. In 2013, enrollees in the programs paid about $90,000 on copays for smoking cessation.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step to try to get folks to reduce or eliminate their dependency on smoking,\u201d Moracco said, adding that the change was passed by the Legislature in 2015. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a huge benefit there for the enrollee. \u2026 We would expect our costs to come down because the costs related to smoking are significant.\u201d\n\nThe state health department estimates that smoking in Minnesota racks up around $2.5 billion annually in medical costs. More than $563 million of these costs are covered by state Medicaid, according to the Department of Human Services.\n\nThe ACA requires that preventive services, including tobacco cessation therapies, be available without copays to people newly covered under the health law by Medicaid.\n\nBut the law didn\u2019t eliminate copays for groups that were eligible for Medicaid before the ACA, said Erika Seward of the American Lung Association. Minnesota is the first state to address that gap, Seward said.\n\nMeanwhile, the American Lung Association is concerned about the premium surcharges that increasingly are being asked of smokers in large employer health plans.\n\n\u201cWe know that the penalties are not effective in encouraging people to get the help they need to quit,\u201d Seward said. \u201cWe know that 70 percent of smokers want to quit. And we know that it takes upward of seven to nine times to quit successfully.\u201d\n\nIn its 2015 survey of employers with more than 500 people, Mercer found the median reduction in annual premiums was about $500 among companies that vary the employee contribution for health insurance based on tobacco-use status.\n\nIt\u2019s a comparable figure in the Twin Cities, said Seng of Dorsey & Whitney, adding that smokers typically can avoid surcharges if they\u2019re trying to quit.\n\nIn 2012, about 19 percent of larger firms surveyed by Mercer said they varied the employee contribution amount based on tobacco-use status, or provided other incentives to encourage employees not to use tobacco. By 2015, the share was up to 29 percent.\n\nWhether the premium surcharges should be considered penalties or incentives is up for debate, Seng said. Opinions are mixed as to the effectiveness of the surcharges, he said, but some of their popularity a few years ago stemmed from CEOs who were particularly bullish on the idea.\n\nThe enthusiasm at the top of organizations has diminished to a degree, Seng said, but surcharges remain a prominent feature of many large employer health plans.\n\nAn emerging trend, he added, is that more companies are considering smoking cessation help for all employees \u2014 not just those in the employee health plan \u2014 in new forms such as apps and enhanced phone counseling and classes.\n\n\u201cI think that some interesting experimentation is going on at the employer level,\u201d Seng said, \u201cto find a new way to fix this problem.\u201d\n\nTwitter: @chrissnowbeck", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "On Jan. 1, the state of Minnesota started waiving copays in the Medicaid and MinnesotaCare programs for prescriptions of FDA-approved smoking cessation medications.", "title": "Still racking up billions in medical costs, smoking returns as health plan target", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/still-racking-up-billions-in-medical-costs-smoking-returns-as-health-plan-target/363873681/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14411404906323.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14411404906323.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "On Jan. 1, the state of Minnesota started waiving copays in the Medicaid and MinnesotaCare programs for prescriptions of FDA-approved smoking cessation medications.", "title": "Still racking up billions in medical costs, smoking returns as health plan target", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/still-racking-up-billions-in-medical-costs-smoking-returns-as-health-plan-target/363873681/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14411404906323.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/ows_14411404906323.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "On Jan. 1, the state of Minnesota started waiving copays in the Medicaid and MinnesotaCare programs for prescriptions of FDA-approved smoking cessation medications."}, "article_summary": "The mix of health plan incentives takes aim at the big health care costs connected with smoking.\n\u2026 We would expect our costs to come down because the costs related to smoking are significant.\u201dThe state health department estimates that smoking in Minnesota racks up around $2.5 billion annually in medical costs.\nMedicaid provides health insurance to people at or below the poverty line, while MinnesotaCare covers a slightly higher-income group.\nFor the past 10 years, the state\u2019s Department of Human Services has covered smoke cessation medications and services in public health insurance programs, said Nathan Moracco, an assistant commissioner.\nThe group hasn\u2019t looked at whether changes in health insurance have contributed to the decline in use, Mason said, but it supports the change in Medicaid and MinnesotaCare."}
