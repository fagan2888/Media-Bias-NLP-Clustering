NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Alfred Lumsdaine, interim chief executive officer of Healthways (NASDAQ: HWAY), today announced that the Company is revising its financial guidance for 2015. This revision is due to lower than expected revenue from a single health plan contract, slower than expected business development and implementation of Dr. Ornish’s Program for Reversing Heart Disease™ (Ornish Reversal Program), and slower than expected business development of the Company’s Blue Zones Project by Healthways® (Blue Zones projects).

The Company now expects revenue for 2015 in a range of $770 million to $785 million compared to a previous range of $800 million to $825 million and revenues of $742 million for 2014. The Company expects the resulting impact on EBITDA from this revenue reduction to be approximately $20 million at the mid-point of the revised revenue guidance range. EBITDA will be further reduced, as previously announced, by approximately $5 million from compensation-related expenses associated with its CEO transition. Consequently the Company now expects EBITDA margin for 2015 in a range of approximately 8.0% to 8.5%.

“We feel it is prudent to revise 2015 guidance now, based on the three factors that have emerged since announcing our first quarter results and the CEO transition,” said Lumsdaine.

The Company anticipates that one significant contract with a commercial health plan will have lower than expected growth in net engaged lives during 2015 primarily because members are currently being graduated from one of the programs at a faster rate than expected. The Company is working collaboratively on both the enrollment and graduation processes with this customer and expects this dynamic to reverse before the end of 2015.

Healthways has also experienced slower implementation and sales cycles for the Ornish Reversal Program. As it gains experience, the Company has realized that health system customers need longer time frames for facility upgrades, program deployment and initial cohort enrollments. All contracts signed prior to 2015 have been implemented and are graduating cohorts. Further, the Company continues to sign new contracts, albeit at a slower pace than previously anticipated.

Finally, the Company has encountered a slower pace of near-term business development for Blue Zones project opportunities originally anticipated for 2015. Healthways has experienced annual revenue growth in the Blue Zones project since 2011 and continues to have an active pipeline of new opportunities.

Lumsdaine added, “We will provide comprehensive financial guidance for 2015 when we announce second-quarter financial results on July 23, 2015.”
