It was Aug. 10, 2015, only four days before the end of his military service commitment and his scheduled return home.\n\nKrypychenko, a private in the Ukrainian army\u2019s 53rd separate mechanized brigade, found himself alone in no man\u2019s land. When an intelligence unit of separatists appeared and approached with weapons drawn, he assumed they were going to execute him.\n\n\u201cI was mentally ready to die,\u201d Krypychenko, 36, tells The Daily Signal in an interview following his release Feb. 20 after 195 days as a prisoner of war in the hands of combined Russian separatist forces.\n\n\u201cIt was a wonder that I lived,\u201d he adds.\n\nMonths into his captivity, while isolated in solitary confinement and with his body covered in wounds from bouts of torture, Krypychenko turned to his religious faith, and even a little humor, to avoid succumbing to despair.\n\n\u201cI felt grateful to God,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m a believer. I was grateful that God saved me from the worst. I was still alive at least. But the hardest part was not knowing what to expect each day.\u201d\n\nIn the dank solitude of his cell, Krypychenko would laugh to himself as he recalled funny childhood memories. In particular, he remembered a trip to a zoo as a boy when a friend stuck his fingers inside a bear cage.\n\n\u201cThe bear bit off one of his fingers,\u201d Krypychenko says, smiling. \u201cAt the time, it was horrible. But when I thought back on it, it seemed so funny for some reason. Humor is helpful in all situations.\u201d\n\nTorture and Wounds\n\nKrypychenko sits in an office in a Kyiv hospital wearing loose blue scrubs. His dark brown hair is long and disheveled. He is clean-shaven and jokes about the beard he grew in captivity. Light blue scars line his pale face and the bridge of his nose.\n\nHe speaks softly and succinctly, sitting slightly hunched forward with his shoulders rounded. He seems tired but not exhausted, exuding an air of simultaneous relief and being slightly overwhelmed by his surroundings. Yet he cracks a small grin as he matter-of-factly explains the conditions of his captivity.\n\n\u201cA couple times, I felt like I was losing hope,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I strengthened myself.\u201d\n\nAs part of ongoing negotiations between Kyiv and the Russian-backed separatist territories in eastern Ukraine, the separatists released four Ukrainian prisoners of war, including Krypychenko. According to Ukrainian news reports, Ukraine released five captured separatists and a priest in exchange for the servicemen.\n\nThe interrogations were \u201cvery rude,\u201d Krypychenko says, as he describes how his captors tortured him with electric shocks and beat him with their fists and wooden planks.\n\nThe first interrogation lasted for about three hours, he explains, but they got shorter as time went on. He was never threatened with execution during those sessions, but the guards occasionally made offhand death threats.\n\nAs to the nationality of his interrogators, whether Ukrainian separatists or Russian intelligence operatives, Krypychenko says he had no reason to believe any were Russian.\n\nHis captors held Krypychenko in solitary confinement for the entirety of the 195 days. They allowed him to leave his cell and go outside under open skies only two times, each at night for about two minutes, so that he could smoke a cigarette. He recalls:\n\nI became indifferent to everything at the end of my captivity. Food even began to lose its taste. I used to ask, \u2018Why me? How could this happen only four days before I was supposed to go home?\u2019\n\nNo Escape\n\nThroughout his captivity, Krypychenko was held in three separate locations. His captors placed a bag over his head when transporting him, which, in addition to his isolation in solitary confinement and lack of contact with fellow prisoners, robbed him of any sense of his surroundings.\n\n\u201cThere was no possibility to escape,\u201d he says. \u201cI never knew where I was.\u201d\n\nHe also was physically ill prepared for an escape attempt.\n\nWhile never denied food or water, sparse meals left Krypychenko weak. He wore only trousers and sandals\u2014no shirt or shoes. Inside his cell he had nothing but a mattress and a blanket, a plastic water bottle he used as a pillow, and a few cigarettes. His worldly possessions were all gifts from a benevolent guard who, Krypychenko explains, was the only person to demonstrate any compassion.\n\n\u201cHe was the only one to show me kindness,\u201d Krypychenko says.\n\nThis same guard allowed Krypychenko to make his two trips outside to smoke a cigarette, allowed him to call home on a cellphone from time to time, and ultimately delivered news of his release.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Krypychenko says. \u201cThe guard who helped me, he came and told me I was going to be released. I didn\u2019t believe it at first. I couldn\u2019t believe that I was going home.\u201d\n\nStalemate in the Conflict\n\nThe exchange of prisoners between Kyiv and the self-proclaimed separatist republics has been a drawn out, sticky point of contention marring full implementation of the Minsk II cease-fire deal, which went into effect in February 2015.\n\nPrisoner exchanges often occur outside official government channels, with personal favors, bribes, and the efforts of individual families to get their soldiers back driving the negotiations. Consequently, captured Ukrainian soldiers have become both political bargaining chips and a means to extort bribes for their release.\n\nThe return of prisoners was supposed to have been accomplished in March 2015, within five days after both sides withdrew heavy weapons from the front lines, according to the terms of the Minsk II cease-fire.\n\nThe weapons pullback was scheduled for two days after the truce went into effect Feb. 15, 2015. But more than a year later, the Ukraine war appears to be heating up again.\n\nOn Monday, Kyiv reported 69 attacks on Ukrainian positions from a variety of combined Russian separatist weapons, including 82 mm and 120 mm mortars, grenade launchers, machine guns, and small arms. At least five Ukrainian troops died in combat last week.\n\nBoth sides periodically accuse the other of violating the cease-fire\u2019s terms, delaying the full release of prisoners as a way to maintain negotiating leverage.\n\nIt is not immediately clear how many separatist fighters are in Kyiv\u2019s custody. An unconfirmed statement in October by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic (one of the breakaway territories in eastern Ukraine) claimed that more than 1,000 of its fighters were imprisoned.\n\nAnd while combined Russian-separatist forces have released about 3,000 Ukrainian troops from captivity since the conflict began, more than one year after the Minsk II cease-fire, 123 Ukrainian soldiers remain held prisoner, according to the Ukrainian Security Service, or SBU.\n\nWhen he was told about his impending release, Krypychenko says, he was conflicted, flooded with simultaneous feelings of relief and guilt. He knew that other Ukrainian prisoners of war had been in captivity longer\u2014some for more than a year\u2014and many of them never had been properly treated for their injuries.\n\n\u201cI thought if I had the possibility, I would have refused to go home and let someone go in my place,\u201d he says.\n\nThe four prisoners released Feb. 20 were driven to a location on the front lines, where they met Ukrainian officials. They immediately received cell phones to call their families with the good news.\n\n\u201cThe first person I called was my mom,\u201d Krypychenko says.\n\nOn-the-Job Training\n\nIf taken prisoner, U.S. military personnel are required to abide by the \u201cCode of Conduct for Members of the Armed Forces of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe Code of Conduct is an \u201cethical guide\u201d for personal behavior in captivity. It addresses escape attempts, what information is permissible to give the enemy, and how to handle preferential treatment and early release. The document acknowledges the human limits of resistance to torture, as well as how to avoid being exploited for propaganda.\n\nCadets at the U.S. Air Force Academy, for example, are required to memorize the six articles of the Code of Conduct and recite them verbatim while under physical duress. (Punishment for mistakes usually includes a lot of push-ups and burpees.)\n\nAdditionally, U.S. military personnel considered at risk of capture are required to go through what is called Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape (SERE) training, which includes mock capture, interrogation, and torture scenarios.\n\nThe training draws on decades of lessons learned from returned prisoners of war, providing trainees an opportunity to confront the sometimes ethically complicated decisions that arise in captivity.\n\nKrypychenko, however, said the Ukrainian military never provided him any formal training on conduct as a POW. While under the threat of torture and extended captivity, he could rely only on his personal judgment. He basically had to wing it.\n\nThe interrogation sessions, for example, focused on Ukrainian troop positions and the amount and type of weaponry positioned on the front lines.\n\n\u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t tell the truth,\u201d Krypychenko says. \u201cI pointed to wrong places on the map. I had friends in those positions. I couldn\u2019t tell the truth. I didn\u2019t want my friends to get hurt.\u201d\n\n\u2018Traces of Trauma\u2019\n\nAlexander Naumenko, the civilian doctor who first treated Krypychenko and the three other prisoners of war released Feb. 20, says this was his first time treating returned prisoners of war. He had no specific protocol to follow for their rehabilitation.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of expertise with this,\u201d the doctor tells The Daily Signal. \u201cBut we have all the specialists we need.\u201d\n\nNaumenko says all four returned POWs were in stable condition with no fresh wounds to treat when they arrived. Their bodies, however, offered clues to their ordeals in captivity.\n\n\u201cWe see the traces of trauma, on their skulls and across their whole bodies,\u201d Naumenko says. \u201cBut it\u2019s impossible to tell what caused these traumas. It\u2019s impossible for me to say it was torture.\u201d\n\nBeyond the physical scars, Naumenko says, the four released soldiers all demonstrated symptoms of post-traumatic stress.\n\n\u201cThey are very depressed,\u201d he says. \u201cTheir psychological conditions require long-term medical treatment.\u201d\n\nVadym Krypychenko suffered no permanent or disabling injuries from his captivity. The wounds inflicted by the electric shocks and beatings have healed, leaving behind faint scars. His skin is ashen white from months without sunlight. Yet his time as a POW has affected him in more subtle ways.\n\nHe says he suffers from insomnia\u2014not due to flashbacks or lingering fear from his captivity, he insists, but because he still can\u2019t believe that he actually is free. The mental \u201carmor\u201d he put up to maintain hope and strength in the darkest hours of his captivity is not so easy to take down, he says:\n\nWhen I wake up, I still have to remind myself that I\u2019m free. It\u2019s not a tragic emotion; I only have to remind myself that I\u2019m finally safe. I just cannot get to the idea that I\u2019m free.\n\nLife Goes On\n\nBefore Krypychenko was drafted into military service in 2014, he was an auto mechanic living in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine\u2019s third largest city.\n\nOnce released from the hospital in Kyiv, Krypychenko plans to return home and resume his old life.\n\n\u201cI want to go home,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a military man anymore.\u201d\n\nAfter the interview with The Daily Signal, Krypychenko steps outside the back door of the hospital and smokes a cigarette. He wears a cardigan over his hospital scrubs. The day is gray and rainy, but he has open sky over his head.\n\nHe takes a long, last puff of his cigarette, tosses it to the ground, and puts out the butt with the twisting heel of his sandal-covered foot.\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t believe I\u2019m free,\u201d he says, shaking his head and smiling.", "article_metadata": {"description": "This 36-year-old soldier was held as a prisoner of war for 195 days by combined Russian-separatist forces.
