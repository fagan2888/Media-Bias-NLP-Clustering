So impressive was their set, it encouraged other EDM artists to go all-out with their production. Add Skrillex to the list of those who have lived up to the challenge: his no-prisoners Coachella set was loud, raw and utterly entertaining, thanks to his non-stop energy and the launch of a major set-piece that was completely jaw-dropping.\n\nCOACHELLA 2014: FULL COVERAGE\n\nSkrillex\u2019s prop of choice was a gigantic, arena-ready fighter-jet (think of an X-wing from \"Star Wars\"). The set-piece was larger than the ones he has played in over previous years and was abetted with an ever-increasing amount of lasers that blasted out above the packed crowd, wings that moved, and billowing smoke machines that gave the producer (real name: Sonny Moore) the appearance of flight.\n\n\n\nNot that Skrillex needed the help finding his wings: he actually launched himself high in the air regularly, coming out of his cockpit/booth to get the crowd amped up before taking a giant leap back to his seat, landing (of course) just as the bass dropped.\n\n\n\nIf that were it, it\u2019d still have been an EDM set that could convert genre naysayers. But Moore\u2019s production also utilized the whole of the Sahara tent\u2019s monstrous lighting rig, allowing huge trusses to level themselves mere inches above the crowd\u2019s head, then fly back up two stories and back down again, making the crowd even more a part of the show (similar technology was used on last year\u2019s Nine Inch Nails tour).\n\n\n\nThe audience, of course, responded in kind, especially when Skrillex invited fellow DJ Dillon Francis to lead an audience-participation bit (the overused but still fun \u201cget down as low as you can and then jump all together\u201d routine), or when hip-hop star A$AP Rocky bounded onstage for a frantic version of their collaboration \u201cWild for the Night.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt doesn\u2019t hurt that the music Moore has far more personality than that of many of his dance-music counterparts. His signature sound \u2013- heard on the tracks of his new album \u201cRecess\u201d -- is a bottom-heavy din that evolves into a four-on-the-floor big beat, but it somehow approaches genre conventions rather than embraces them. Even as Skrillex has become something of a mainstream name his sound still reeks of rawness and danger. All the better, than, for it to be juxtaposed with massive videos of throwback anime and, uh, the title screen to the \u201890s sitcom \u201cFull House.\u201d\n\n\n\nAll these components together meant the set -- and the spectacle \u2013 resonated loudly. It was no Daft Punk, but nothing may ever hit that peak again. At least Moore\u2019s helming a ship that\u2019s approaching the same orbit.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Billboard", "description": "Skrillex blows minds with a props that rivals Daft Punk's classic Coachella pyramid.", "title": "Coachella 2014: Skrillex Takes Control of the Cockpit During Stellar Set", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6051841/coachella-2014-skrillex-takes-control-of-the-cockpit-during", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/skrillex-coachella-560-430.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Skrillex blows minds with a props that rivals Daft Punk's classic Coachella pyramid.", "title": "Coachella 2014: Skrillex Takes Control of the Cockpit During Stellar Set", "url": "http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/music-festivals/6051841/coachella-2014-skrillex-takes-control-of-the-cockpit-during", "image": "http://www.billboard.com/files/media/skrillex-coachella-560-430.jpg", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Skrillex blows minds with a props that rivals Daft Punk's classic Coachella pyramid.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Coachella 2014: Skrillex Takes Control of the Cockpit During Stellar Set | Billboard"}, "article_summary": "When Daft Punk played Coachella in 2006 with their now-legendary, sensory-overloading pyramid-light show, they laid down the gauntlet for every major electronic act thereafter.\nSo impressive was their set, it encouraged other EDM artists to go all-out with their production.\nCOACHELLA 2014: FULL COVERAGESkrillex\u2019s prop of choice was a gigantic, arena-ready fighter-jet (think of an X-wing from \"Star Wars\").\nEven as Skrillex has become something of a mainstream name his sound still reeks of rawness and danger.\nIf that were it, it\u2019d still have been an EDM set that could convert genre naysayers."}
