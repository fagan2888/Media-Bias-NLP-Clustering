REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\n4608370\n\nOminous signs are proliferating among 22 Obamacare health insurance co-ops of imminent financial collapses that could leave more than a million Americans without coverage, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group analysis.\n\nAll but one of the federally funded co-ops are experiencing accelerating net losses. President Obama\u2019s signature health care reform program established the co-ops to provide non-profit competition to private sector health insurance providers.\n\nMany of the 22 co-ops could soon follow an Obamacare co-op that defaulted earlier this year, suffering $163 million in operating losses in a single year. That collapse left 120,000 customers without coverage on Christmas Eve.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly going to have fewer co-op\u2019s by the end of the year,\u201d Thomas Miller, a resident health care fellow at the American Enterprise Institute think tank, told DCNF.\n\nNew figures compiled by Miller and Marie-Grace Turner, president of the Galen Institute, show that net losses for the co-ops reached a record $614 million in 2014. Both AEI and Galen are Obamacare critics.\n\nThe figure is nearly three times the $234 million in losses suffered through the first three quarters of 2014 as reported by Standards & Poor\u2019s in a February 2015 report. It means that the burn rate for the experimental Obamacare co-ops is quickening.\n\n\u201cAll but one of the co-ops,\u201d S&P noted, \u201creported negative net income through the first three quarters of 2014.\u201d\n\nInsurance ratings firm A.M. Best also warned in January that as of September 30, 2014, \u201cthe ratio of surplus notes outstanding to capital and surplus exceeded 100% for all of the co-ops.\u201d\n\nArizona\u2019s Meritus Mutual Health Partners co-op has long-term loans that are nearly 1,000 percent of the value of its capital and surplus, according to A.M. Best.\n\nS&P identified the co-ops suffering the worst capital ratios as those in Illinois, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada and Maryland.\n\nThe Community Health Alliance co-op in Tennessee reported that it\u2019s net losses were 314% of its federal funding, according to the S&P report.\n\nCommunity Health said in January that it would no longer offer insurance on the state exchange, according to the Tennessean daily newspaper. The co-op enrolled 140 customers and received $73 million from Obamacare, a cost of more $521,ooo per enrollee.\n\nAnother indication of serious co-op financial weakness is the fact that CMS gave out $317 million in additional \u201csolvency loans\u201d to one out of every three co-ops last year.\n\nThe injection of the federal funds was to prevent co-op capital reserves from falling below the minimum capital rates set by each state insurance commissioner.\n\nThe emerging picture of massive losses across all of the federal co-ops was forecast by an original White House Office and Management and Budget estimate that warned up to four of every 10 co-ops could default.\n\nThe human wreckage left behind a failing co-op was seen earlier this year when regulators in Iowa and Nebraska liquidated the assets of a failing federal health care co-op known as Co-Opportunity Health. Insurance regulators officially declared the co-op was in \u201chazardous condition\u201d last December.\n\nCo-op supporters hailed Co-Opportunity health because it had initially enrolled 50,000 customers, the second highest in the nation.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased with the market response to our products,\u201d said David Lyons, Co-Opportunity\u2019s chief executive officer and a politically-connected former Iowa insurance commissioner.\n\nWhat Lyons failed to say was that Co-Opportunity slashed prices and offered very low, below-market premiums to attract new customers.\n\nThe low premiums came at a cost. Co-Opportunity\u2019s ratio of costs to premiums was 140 percent. That meant that for every dollar it collected in premiums, it had to pay out $1.40 in medical claims.\n\nThe ratio is not much better among the other remaining co-ops. According to Scott E. Harrington of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Leonard David Institute of Health Economics, \u201cThe ratios for the first three quarters of 2014 produced \u201ca total ratio of costs-to-premiums of 116 percent.\n\n\u201cMost co-ops\u2019 weak operating performance is a result of high medical claims,\u201d concluded S&P, adding, that the medical costs were \u201chopelessly high\u201d for many of the co-ops.\n\nBrian Gillette, the chief operating officer of the Urbandale, Iowa-based Group Benefits Limited, said that the unexpected closure of Co-Opportunity Health was \u201cmassively disruptive\u201d to 800 of his employer groups and for thousands of individual policyholders.\n\n\u201cWe were notified on Christmas eve that the insurance division was taking over Co-Opportunity Health,\u201d Gillette told the DCNF in an interview. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was without precedent in my career.\u201d\n\nHints of the financial Co-Opportunity debacle came last September when the co-op abruptly announced it was dumping more than 10,000 of its poorest and sickest customers and transferring them to the state\u2019s Medicaid program.\n\nThat harsh action appeared contrary to the originally stated mission of the consumer-oriented co-op as presented by Obama administration officials.\n\nAt its formation, federal officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services promised the co-ops would offer \u201caffordable, consumer-friendly and high quality health insurance options.\u201d\n\nSally Pipes, another Obamacare critic who is president of the Pacific Research Institute think tank, called the dumping of enrollees \u201ctotally, absolutely immoral.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were dumped on Medicaid, I\u2019d be furious,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Richard Pollock", "description": "All but one of the 22 remaining co-ops suffer large net operating losses", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Ominous signs are proliferating among 22 Obamacare health insurance co-ops of imminent financial collapses that could leave more than a million Americans without coverage, according to a Daily Caller", "title": "Are Obamacare\u2019s 22 Health Insurance Co-ops Near Financial Collapse?", "url": "http://dailycaller.com/2015/06/18/are-obamacares-22-health-insurance-co-ops-near-financial-collapse/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cdn01.dailycaller.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014-05-11T111452Z_1_CBREA4A0V8T00_RTROPTP_4_USA-HEALTHCARE-TECHNOLOGY-e1434574559532.jpg", "height": 516}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "All but one of the 22 remaining co-ops suffer large net operating losses", "title": "Are Obamacare\u2019s 22 Health Insurance Co-ops Near Financial Collapse?
