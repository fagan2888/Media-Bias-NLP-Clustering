Welcome to Monday, the 138th day of 2015 and the 119th year since the Supreme Court, upheld the pro-segregation “separate but equal” doctrine in the landmark Plessy v. Ferguson case, which was the law of the land for nearly six decades despite evidence that “equal” tended not to be part of the equation. African-Americans during the Jim Crow era that followed didn’t have equal access to quality housing or education, creating conditions that analysts say has led to several generations of urban poverty. Here is your Three-Minute Briefing, all the News You Can Use in 180 seconds or less:

Obamacare Death Panel: As the positives for Obamacare continued to accrue – increases in insurance coverage, less public acrimony and no health care apocalypses as had been predicted – and a conservative-backed challenge to the law made its way to the Supreme Court, congressional Republicans suggested they’d fix things if SCOTUS gutted the law. But now that the court is on the brink of ruling in the King v. Burwell case, there’s no clear Republican plan on a temporary Obamacare fix, and the GOP in fact may be choreographing a victory dance.

Charles in Charge: Criminal justice reform is becoming a thing, and not just on the campaign trail. Taking a cue from senators and best bros Corey Booker of New Jersey and Rand Paul of Kentucky, the latter of whom just happens to be running for president, Congress is taking up the mantle of change for a system that disproportionately puts African-Americans behind bars, largely because of nonviolent drug offenses. And there appears to be a new and unlikely proponent of said change: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa, a conservative who delivered a speech and other remarks recently that hint he’s open to talking about adjusting mandatory minimum drug sentences.
