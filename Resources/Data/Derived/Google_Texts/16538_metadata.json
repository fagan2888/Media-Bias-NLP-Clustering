Regardless, the proposal passed with 50.3 percent supporting more stringent quotas on entry to Switzerland from the EU. The BBC analyzed the significance of the referendum after Sunday\u2019s tally:\n\nThe BBC\u2019s Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the vote has shown up traditional divisions, with French-speaking areas against the quotas, German-speaking regions divided, and the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino firmly in favour.

[...] In a statement, the European Commission said it regretted that an \u201cinitiative for the introduction of quantitative limits to immigration has been passed by this vote. \u201cThis goes against the principle of free movement of persons between the EU and Switzerland.
