HIPAA breach thereafter. Test us.\u201d\n\nSomeone operating under the shadowy auspices of Anonymous, with the handle AnonMercurial, tweeted that at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital during the notorious attack this spring.\n\nd0x, for the uninitiated, is hackerspeak referring to publicly posting personal information. Indeed, Anonymous had already revealed some personal information about Joseph Johnson, the judge presiding over the case of Justina Pelletier, with which Anonymous took issue.\n\n\u201cWe knew they were serious at this point,\u201d Daniel Nigrin, MD, CIO of Boston Children\u2019s said. \u201cThis was a little bit weird, a little bit scary and frankly caught us off-kilter.\u201d\n\nAs serious as it is, Anonymous is only one of a cadre of threat actors \u2014 and others, including nation-states, are far more organized, have deeper pockets and more sophisticated technologies at their disposal.\n\n\u201cWe know bad guys are out there. They\u2019re very good at what they do. They're now targeting healthcare. We\u2019re on the hook now \u2014 and we have data that our adversaries want,\u201d said Cris Ewell, CISO of Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital. \u201cWe know our adversaries' ability to attack outpaces our ability to stop them.\u201d\n\nGeopolitics of cybersecurity\n\nBoston Children\u2019s is not even the most recent incident. The attack last month on Community Health Systems, wherein Chinese hackers reportedly stole 4.5 million records via the Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL, was the first known attack in which a nation-state targeted a U.S. healthcare entity.\n\n\u201cCybersecurity activity is following the geopolitical landscape,\u201d said Jim Routh, chief information security office of Aetna. \u201cWe in healthcare not only have to deal with organized crime that have sophisticated capabilities, we also have to deal with nation states. They have more skill and competence than we have.\u201d\n\nIndeed, U.S. cyberenemies are going after intellectual property, the intelligence on medical devices, as well as treatment regiments for things like cancer, population health management, or plans for handling the Ebola outbreak, according to Esmond Kane, deputy CISO at Partners HealthCare.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hacktivism in these criminal syndicates,\u201d Kane added.\n\nTime to rethink security in a substantive way\n\nChief information security officers including Routh and Ewell advocated for dramatic shifts away from compliance-based security and toward a risk management approach at the HIMSS Media and Healthcare IT News Privacy and Security Forum in Boston in early September.\n\n\u201cThe threat landscape is changing far too quickly for just a compliance-based approach to security,\u201d Routh said, urging that hospitals need both a compliance program that aligns with federal mandates and risk management. \u201cI take risks in order to manage risks more effectively.\u201d\n\nRouth pointed toward three massive changes to the threat landscape: organized cyber criminals, the proliferation of mobile devices, and the aforementioned shifting geopolitical landscape.\n\n\u201cToday,\u201d Routh explained, \u201cthe whole attack surface has fundamentally changed.\u201d\n\nWhich is part of the reason Seattle Children\u2019s CISO Ewell recommends the Assumption of Breach methodology as part of risk management.\n\n\u201cForget about \u2018protecting the perimeter\u2019 because that philosophy is gone,\u201d Ewell said during an interview. \u201cYou can\u2019t put up larger walls, you can't post more guards, you can\u2019t do those things to keep the people out, therefore change your philosophy to \u2018they\u2019re already inside.\u2019\u201d\n\nTexas Health Resources CIO Ed Marx recommends building resiliency into hospital security programs \u2014 and following clinicians\u2019 footsteps into making decisions informed by information.\n\n\u201cOur security program is based on measurement and based on data, not emotion,\u201d Marx said, explaining that his team has a daily rhythm to identify current threats. \u201cWe\u2019re able to take that data and then do some proactive intelligence.\u201d\n\nWhen Marx and Chief Security Officer Ron Mehring heard about the attack on Community Health Systems, for instance, the team was able to evaluate what happened to the other organization and address any similar potential problems or security holes Texas Health might have within 48 hours.\n\nAetna\u2019s Routh added that seeking cybersecurity intelligence and sharing information help him make better decisions if only because they know what's out there, understand priorities to guard against immediately, and can grasp those threats that are perhaps not as bad as they might appear before conducting such analysis.\n\n\u201cRisks are everywhere,\u201d Marx said. \u201cIf you think about it all the time you\u2019d never sleep and have less hair than I do. That\u2019s no way to live.\u201d\n\nMore exposed than ever\n\nPart of the problem is that healthcare is among the last American business sectors undergoing industrialization and, as such, security has been something of an afterthought.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of flown under the radar,\u201d said Nathan Russ, director of healthcare for security vendor Symantec, while the focus has been on attacking other industries. Claiming that \u201cSymantec sees more ugly stuff out there than anyone in the world,\u201d Russ explained that healthcare is now more exposed than ever.\n\n\u201cSecurity is underfunded in healthcare,\u201d Russ said. \u201cNot enough people, too many threats.\u201d\n\nSometimes cyber and non-cyber attacks can alter fate. Take the Boston Marathon bombing in April 2013, for instance.\n\nAs John Halamka, MD explained it, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where he is concurrently CIO and acting CISO, did not previously have a buttoned-up cyber risk management framework prior to the attack.\n\n\u201cWe just had people get together and discuss what we believed to be the biggest threats at that particular time,\u201d Halamka said. Since then, however, BIDMC has instituted a framework and engages in the sort of cybersecurity threat intelligence Marx and Routh espouse.\n\nSo when Community Health Systems was attacked, Halamka and his team were able to determine that CHS was running a Juniper SSL VPN, just like BIDMC, that uses the OpenSSL stack vulnerable to Heartbleed and, had they not already taken corrective action when Heartbleed was first revealed, BIDMC would have been able to quickly plug the hole.\n\nHacktavism is real\n\n\u201cIt all started in March,\u201d Boston Children\u2019s CIO Nigrin said. \u201cIt was a shot across our bow \u2014 a real event that we suffered through.\u201d\n\nThe Anonymous attack began with threatening posts on Twitter and Pastebin. Nigrin explained that the information the hacktivists obtained initially, such as Boston Children\u2019s IP address as well as some names and phone numbers, are \u201cnot too hard to get.\u201d\n\nBut it progressed. Three weeks after the threats, Nigrin identified low-level Distributed Denial of Service attacks in a cat-and-mouse fashion.\n\n\u201cWe put a fix in, they hit us a little harder,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was quite frustrating. They could tell we were adjusting to their tactics, and they were accommodating those changes and altering their approach.\u201d\n\nThen, on Patriot\u2019s Day Weekend, which in 2014 was also Easter and of course one year after the marathon bombing, Boston Children\u2019s experienced a massive uptick beginning on Friday night.\n\n\u201cWe couldn't keep up. They filled our Internet pipe, we had no access,\u201d Nigrin (pictured at left) said, explaining that a number of its web sites spanning philanthropy, research, patient and provider portals, as well as Mass Medical and Wayside Youth went down. \u201cAt the same time, they hit us with a massive volume of malware-laden emails.\u201d\n\nNigrin made a gutsy move: Intentionally shutting down Boston Children\u2019s email. Without it, he and his staff literally went around on foot to get the word out to employees about what was going on and thow critical it was to not fall prey to suspicious emails, social engineering, even odd phone calls, such as the few that came in from a (000) 000-0000 origin with a recorded message saying the employees\u2019 personal bank account had been compromised.\n\n\u201cWhat happened next is really interesting and goes back to Anonymous,\u201d Nigrin said.\n\nA new posting on Twitter from the handle @YourAnonNews: \"To all the \u201cAnons\u201d attacking the CHILDRENS HOSPITAL in the name of Anonymous \u2013 IT IS A HOSPITAL: STOP IT.\"\n\nThat Twitter handle had 1.24 million followers at the time \u2014 while @AnonMercurial had a grand total of 6.\n\n\u201cThe attack, I won\u2019t say immediately, went down to a trickle,\u201d Nigrin explained. \u201cIt didn\u2019t go to zero, they must have forgotten to disarm some of the bots, but suffice it to say it was over.\u201d\n\nAnd Boston Children\u2019s slowly started bringing its externally-facing Web sites back online over three weeks\u2019 time.\n\nUsual suspects\n\nNigrin evoked commonly-accepted adjectives when describing Anonymous such as \u201cloose\u201d and \u201cdecentralized\u201d as a group of individual hacktivists.\n\nThose may be true but Anonymous has enough gravitas to at least grab international attention when threatening in a YouTube video to launch \u201ca complete assault\u201d against the \u201cvirtual government\u201d of those supporting the State of Iraq and Syria, aka ISIS, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar, and others.\n\nISIS, while largely a ground effort, has eked out recognition for the potential to wreak cyber havoc, though few attacks have actually been traced back to the group.\n\nAetna\u2019s Routh said that Ukraine has \u201coutstanding technical talent in hackers\u201d but most are focused on Russia for the time being. And Chinese hackers, of course, aptly demonstrated with Community Health Systems their interest in attacking American targets.\n\nPerhaps most telling about the Cybersecurity Cold War: Those are just a fraction of the reported cases, leading one to wonder how many more the public does not even know about.\n\n\u201cBack in the day, life was simpler. It was organized crime coming after financial services because that\u2019s where the money was. It was easy to predict the motive and keep up with the changing tactics,\u201d Routh reflected. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the geopolitical space is having a direct impact on the private sector \u2014 and it\u2019s also having a direct impact on healthcare.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "With the war already underway, how can hospitals and networks prepare?
