Reinforcing rhetoric that feminizes emotional expression and masculinizes violence has the power to stunt empathy, drive dominance, and connect respect with fear. Boys are born loving creatures, but at a very young age they are taught the traits, diminutive language, and mindset that aligns them with society\u2019s concept of what it means to be a man.\n\nThe United States has designed an unrealistic definition of American masculinity. Every single day, there is a boy who feels inferior because he is unable to fit the standard. For some that manage to, it is only an exhaustive fa\u00e7ade covering the truth of his likes, dislikes, emotions, priorities, and passions \u2014 he is constantly putting on a show for the rest of society. In the case of young boys, this happens in school, the ultimate microcosm of our country. School is a time in a child\u2019s life when he postures himself by finding a group of friends, a favorite class subject, sports, hobbies, and musical preferences. Ultimately, it's a time to discover who he is in the world.\n\nFeminism only speaks of one lopsided perspective in the gender inequality story. There is a common misconception that men are a gender exempt from burdening expectations, stereotypes, and societal pressures; free from glass ceilings and slut shaming. But in truth, boys may be faced with a force entirely different, more complicated, and more painful \u2014 being told to fit into a hyper masculine and misogynistic mold. They must mask their emotions. If boys have a natural love for art, theatre, or singing they are immediately categorized, boxed up, and put on a shelf where children are called \u201cgay\u201d and \u201cfag.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were perceptions about males in theatre and up until about 10th grade \u2014 I was a pretty quiet kid,\u201d 26-year-old Thomas Policastro of Long Island, N.Y. told Medical Daily. \u201cI was hit with a couple of mocking jabs along the lines of \u2018real men don't do drama\u2019 in grades 7 and 8.\u201d\n\nPolicastro reflects back to middle school and high school theatre, when kids brought their stereotyping jabs along with their book bags to school. But he attributes his happy childhood to being surrounded by an accepting support system of family and friends who disregarded the ridicule. It\u2019s difficult to tease someone who doesn\u2019t care for the negative and embraces the positive.\n\nThe Battle for Boy Belongingness\n\nNo one can fault a child for walking school halls burdened by the natural desire to fit in, feel accepted, and be well-liked. Both the failure and success of trying to fit the mold of this male illusion can be linked to bullying, high male suicide rates, and even sexism. Cultivating a sense of belongingness among boys is the psychological fertilizer that grows gangs, cliques, and tightly knit friendships all the way into adulthood. It\u2019s the reason why the school cafeteria is the center for socialization, where who you sit with reflects the group you fit into.\n\nBarbara Williams, who holds a master\u2019s degree in counseling psychology and mothers three boys aged 18, 15, and 12, recalls a memorable lunchroom experience with her youngest son: \u201cIn the beginning of the school year, Ethan was pushed off the school lunch bench by a boy from his basketball team and told he wasn't cool enough to sit there anymore. He didn\u2019t tell me for over a month. Then the boy shoved him very hard on the basketball court. Ethan told the coach and then it all came pouring out. What hurt him the most was that his friends didn\u2019t say anything or stand up to the bully.\u201d\n\nPrevious research looking into patterns of social bullying \u2014 also called relational aggression \u2014 among both boys and girls found that boys engaged in mean verbal behavior in attempts to exclude the target from the social group. It also found they were more physically aggressive than girls, which is no surprise. Harming others through damaging or manipulating relationships is often more derimental to a boy's self-esteem, whether it's done verbally, or by physically shoving the child out of the group.\n\nOftentimes, bullying stems from a home environment in which emotional expression is suppressed.

After his parents divorced, he was raised by a father with a history of getting kicked out of sporting events. Williams recognizes that \u201canger and anxiety don\u2019t just pop out of the blue.\" They come \"from somewhere, whether it\u2019s problems at home or school.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t a story about bullying, however; bullying is only a mask boys wear. It represents a long-held lineage of teaching aggressive and powerful patterns born out of the emotional silence, according to the widely read parenting book Raising Cain: Protecting the Emotional Life of Boys. Society needs to transform into one that provides role models who show boys emotion doesn't equate to weakness, and exerting dominance leads to fear rather than respect.\n\nA Gender of Silence\n\nThey are the aggressors, the ones who slam fists against lockers and have fights on the school bus. We\u2019re raising large groups of the human population to lock themselves within their anger, and it isn\u2019t long before they become prisoners to it. We can break these barriers down easily; a dad who cries during a sad movie or recognizes the beauty of a flower teaches his son that it's okay to be sensitive, Williams said. She also points out, of course, that not everyone has a father. Those circumstances are when uncles, grandfathers, coaches, and teachers need to step in and recognize their responsibility to show that child a healthy model of masculinity.\n\n\u201cThe problem we see with boys \u2014 they don\u2019t have an emotional literacy,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThey say \u2018I\u2019m angry\u2019 or nothing at all. They don\u2019t have the tools to express exactly what they\u2019re feeling, and we created that problem as a collective society. Parents and schools need to take part in promoting self-expression.\u201d\n\nThat verbal expression, of course, should start with the parents. One study found mothers may be the best initiators of this emotional literacy, since they tend to use more emotional words with their children than fathers. However, they're also more likely to use those words in conversations with their daughters and not their sons. Changing this, so that mothers can talk to their sons in the same way, could teach boys how to express themselves without fear.\n\nTeaching boys empathy and emotional awareness will help them navigate through social traumas as children and teenagers, which will equip them for the pressures they\u2019re bound to face in adulthood. Williams said her school district has already made great strides in encouraging both boys and girls to confront their emotions through the anti-bully, anti-drug, and anti-drinking and driving video lessons they\u2019re exposed to as early as sixth grade.\n\nWithout an outlet or opportunity to foster healthy emotional expression, any child, boy or girl, can be left with dead ends and a deafening sense of loneliness. Every day, at least three boys commit suicide in the U.S., according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Males dominate suicide statistics and it is no coincidence they are the gender more likely to suppress emotions. They resort to violence or extreme behaviors, desperate to express themselves, yet unable to fit the stereotype of what it means to be \u201ca real man.\u201d The frustration can quickly build, fester, and ultimately manifest into shame and humiliation.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, girls are also hurting. Boys may have more successful suicide attempts, but girls resort to less lethal avenues, with pills and self-mutilation. We constantly search for ways to improve misconceptions on gender, but feminism has monopolized the podium. Women publicize their unhappiness with gender inequalities because they have been given the tools to weave together beautiful, expressive words. But who will stand up and speak for our boys? It's time we did something about it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "what, it, means, be, man, how, male, gender, stereotypes, try, fit, growing, boys, mold, and, fail", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Boys are often taught to be strong and withhold their emotions, but such an upbringing could lead to emotional ineptitude, and lead to psychological problems later in life.", "title": "Male Gender Stereotypes Are Ruining Boys' Futures", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/what-it-means-be-man-how-male-gender-stereotypes-try-fit-growing-boys-mold-and-fail-326450", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/21/male-gender-roles.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Boys are often taught to be strong and withhold their emotions, but such an upbringing could lead to emotional ineptitude, and lead to psychological problems later in life.", "title": "Male Gender Stereotypes Are Ruining Boys' Futures", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/what-it-means-be-man-how-male-gender-stereotypes-try-fit-growing-boys-mold-and-fail-326450", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/21/male-gender-roles.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/21/male-gender-roles.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Opinion", "published_time": "2015-03-22T10:54:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-23T12:52:49-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Boys are often taught to be strong and withhold their emotions, but such an upbringing could lead to emotional ineptitude, and lead to psychological problems later in life."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda352\"", "article_summary": "Every day, at least three boys commit suicide in the U.S., according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.\nBoth the failure and success of trying to fit the mold of this male illusion can be linked to bullying, high male suicide rates, and even sexism.\nBoys may have more successful suicide attempts, but girls resort to less lethal avenues, with pills and self-mutilation.\n\u201cThe problem we see with boys \u2014 they don\u2019t have an emotional literacy,\u201d Williams said.\nIn the case of young boys, this happens in school, the ultimate microcosm of our country."}
