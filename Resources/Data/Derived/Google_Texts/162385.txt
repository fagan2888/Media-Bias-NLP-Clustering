A Colorado-sponsored effort to popularize Obamacare as something more cool like “Brobamacare” is taking off nationally, with some eye-catching ads that may endorse keg stands as much as they endorse health care.

Perhaps some unfortunate timing that the ads appeared on the same day we wrote about frustrating consumer problems with Colorado’s web sites for the new health insurance. But the progressive groups sponsoring the ads are forging ahead anyway, and getting free attention for their efforts. Here you go, from the folks at the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative and ProgressNow Colorado Education, the “Got Insurance?” ad. No word yet whether Colorado’s burgeoning microbrew industry will be competing to sponsor the space on the silver keg.
