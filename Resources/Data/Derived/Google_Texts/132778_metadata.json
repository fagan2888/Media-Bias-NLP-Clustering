John McCain stumbled badly six years ago in his presidential contest against Democrat Barak Obama, and the one-time political maverick has been trying ever since to rebrand himself as the Republicans\u2019 unparalleled spokesman on foreign policy and defense.\n\nIn recent months, the hard-charging Arizona Republican has sharply critiqued President Obama on virtually every major facet of his foreign policy, from battling the ISIS terrorists in Iraq and Syria to countering Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of eastern Ukraine to negotiating with Iran on the future of that country\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nRelated: How a GOP Senate Would Challenge Obama on Foreign Policy\n\nMcCain, 78, can be expected to step up his demands for a more robust and combative U.S. posture in January, when he becomes chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee as part of the GOP takeover of the Senate.\n\nThe heavily decorated Vietnam War era Navy pilot and prisoner of war will share the foreign policy portfolio with Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, the likely new chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, and Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, the incoming chair of the Intelligence Committee.\n\nBut by dint of his forceful personality and perseverance, McCain is likely to dominate the spotlight \u2013 especially early in the new Congress, when Obama\u2019s choice to succeed ousted Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel will be grilled by members of the Armed Services Committee in confirmation hearings.\n\n\u201cAs a general matter, we are likely to see a lot of aggressive efforts on the part of a Republican Senate to put the administration on the defensive,\u201d said Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert with the American Enterprise Institute.\n\nRelated: McCain: Give Obama More War Powers Against ISIS\n\n\u201cWith McCain, he\u2019s got a lot of differences with the administration on these policies and I think he will be doing his best to put officials on the defensive,\u201d Ornstein added. \u201cAnd in some ways it\u2019s not going to be difficult to put them on the defensive, because there are some real questions about what to do . . . in this world where it\u2019s very hard to do things given the asymmetric threats and the limits to our power and resources.\u201d\n\nExperts say McCain \u2013 along with calling for a tougher stance in the Middle East and eastern Europe \u2013 will also play a key role in writing the defense authorization bill, which sets policies on everything from defense spending to weapons systems to closing military bases. .\n\nWhile the appropriations committees technically control the government\u2019s purse strings, McCain will have a big say in how the Defense Department spends its money. He\u2019ll fight to lift artificial spending caps on defense spending to prevent what he fears might be a hollowing out of the military.\n\nAt the same time, however, he will pound away at what he views as wasteful spending on outmoded and ineffective weapons systems.\n\nRelated: U.S. Military Campaign Against ISIS May Cost $15 Billion a Year\n\n\u201cMcCain has really been tough on defense contracting and cost overruns,\u201d said Lawrence Korb, a military analyst and senior fellow with the Center for American Progress. \u201cHe knows cost overruns are why we haven\u2019t been able to get more bang for the buck.\u201d\n\nWhile unforeseen events are certain to shape McCain\u2019s future positions, here is where he stands for now on six pressing defense issues facing the Obama administration, judging by his speeches and previous statements:\n\nOne: Eliminating spending caps\n\nMcCain has said he\u2019ll lead the effort to end sequestration, which mandates automatic across-the-board spending cuts to control the long-term deficit. \u201cI want to start an examination of our policies in the world and then find out whether we have the capability to meet these expectations,\u201d McCain said.\n\nTwo: Granting the president new war powers\n\nHe\u2019s prepared to give Obama a wide berth in pursuing the war against ISIS in Syria and Iraq as part of new war powers authority that Congress is likely to approve. \u201cI would like to see an authorization that frankly does not restrict the commander in chief,\u201d McCain said.\n\nRelated: The New Senate Power Grid: Here\u2019s Who Has the Juice\n\nThree: Defeating ISIS\n\nMcCain believes Obama\u2019s strategy for degrading and defeating ISIS through airstrikes and training and arming friendly rebel forces is woefully inadequate, especially with Obama\u2019s pledge to avoid putting U.S. boots on the ground. McCain would provide weapons directly to the Kurdish Pershmerga freedom fighters in Iraq, create a no-fly zone in Syria, provide a more robust arming of the Free Syrian Army, dispatch more forward air controllers on the ground and dramatically increase U.S. and allied airstrikes.\n\nWhy This Matters\n\nIn recent years Republicans have blasted President Obama\u2019s foreign policy and defense strategies without really having to answer for the blunders in Iraq and Afghanistan of former president George W. Bush. Now Sen. John McCain and other GOP leaders will assume leadership positions on the top Senate committees overseeing defense issues \u2013 and will have to assume greater responsibility for the war against ISIS and other Mideast terrorists, especially as rising costs become a key concern.\n\nFour: Standing up to Putin in Ukraine\n\nMcCain says the U.S. should provide weapons to the Ukrainian army and do what it can to repel Russian-backed rebels from the Crimea. Under Obama\u2019s do-nothing policy, Putin is \u201cwinning,\u201d said McCain, by provoking the slaughter of over 4,000 Ukranian soliders and dismembering a country in Europe for the first time since the end of World War II. \u201cWe won\u2019t give [Ukraine] weapons to defend themselves,\u201d he has complained.\n\nFive: Resisting a weak deal with Iran over nukes\n\nMcCain is keeping a close eye on important nuclear talks with Iran about approaches that would limit that country\u2019s nuclear stockpile and centrifuges. He views Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment program as a direct threat to Israel, and has called on the Senate to pass bipartisan sanctions against Iran should current negotiations fail.\n\n\u201cThe Iranians have a long record of cheating, of concealing their nuclear capabilities,\u201d he said. \u201cThey continue to develop the warhead and the missiles to deliver nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nRelated: John McCain Is the Least Popular Senator in the Country\n\nSix: Standing by Israel at all cost\n\nMcCain says bluntly that U.S. recognition of a Palestinian state is not in the cards, and that there cannot be peace in that region until Hamas extremists dedicated to the destruction of Israel are driven out of Gaza. \u201cThank God for Iron Dome [the Israeli missile defense system], otherwise we would have seen carnage in Israel,\u201d he said.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Ever since Sen.
