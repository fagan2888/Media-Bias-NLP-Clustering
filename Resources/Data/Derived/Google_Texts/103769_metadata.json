Gothard had already been placed on leave pending an investigation into the allegations, which span the last three decades.\n\nGothard, who is unmarried, founded IBLP in 1961 to hawk his \u201cBasic Seminar,\u201d which purports to teach families how to solve interpersonal conflicts. IBLP quickly expanded and now functions as an umbrella organization for a fundamen- talist Christian empire that includes prison ministries, homes for troubled youth and a law school.\n\nAn early advocate of the Christian home-school movement, Gothard also produced a fundamentalist curriculum under the banner of the Advanced Training Institute (ATI), a branch of IBLP.\n\nGothard\u2019s material has found its way into various public institutions. Zack Kopplin\u2019s recent Slate expos\u00e9 of Responsive Education Solutions, a Texas-based charter school system, revealed that the ostensibly secular company lifted material directly from Gothard\u2019s curriculum and relied on IBLP buzzwords.\n\n\u201cSome of Responsive Ed\u2019s lessons appear harmless at first, but their origin is troubling,\u201d Kopplin wrote. \u201cStudents also learn about \u2018discernment,\u2019 which is defined as \u2018understanding the deeper reasons why things happen.\u2019 In other sections, students learn other moral lessons such as \u2018values\u2019 and \u2018deference.\u2019\u201d\n\nResponsive Ed, which educates approximately 12,000 students in Texas alone and has a presence in other states, received taxpayer funds through a voucher plan to push Gothard\u2019s extremist views in classrooms.\n\nGothard\u2019s teachings have also found their way into prisons. IBLP trains prison chaplains and delivers Gothard\u2019s Basic Seminar to inmates in voluntary programs. His approach has received praise from elected officials, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida state Rep. Charles Van Zant.\n\nFormer Fla. Gov. Jeb Bush, who promised to lead a \u201cmoral and spiritual awakening\u201d in the state during his inauguration in 1999, also had a fondness for Gothard\u2019s work. Under Bush\u2019s guidance, hundreds of state employees who oversaw welfare programs were trained in a controversial program cal\u00adled \u201cCharacter First.\u201d The Fort L\u00adau\u00add\u00ad\u00aderdale Sun-Sentinel reported that Goth\u00adard\u2019s program teaches \u201cthe importance of meekness, deference and obedience\u201d \u2013 at least as Gothard interprets them.\n\nAdditionally, IBLP runs a network of \u201ctraining centers,\u201d which advertise themselves as safe havens for troubled youngsters. An eyewitness investigation by WTHR-TV, an NBC affiliate in In\u00addiana, revealed that IBLP\u2019s Indian\u00ada\u00adpo\u00adlis Training Center (ITC) abused its juv\u00adenile residents \u2013 with the state\u2019s help.\n\n\u201cHundreds of young people from around the country come to the ITC \u2013 some sent by their parents, others by juvenile court \u2013 for a special brand of Bible-based learning and counseling,\u201d the report read.\n\nITC, like all IBLP training centers, answered directly to Gothard and used his religious curriculum and disciplinary methods to work with minors. According to WTHR, a local juvenile court judge sent more than three dozen children to the center.\n\nGothard even has close ties to Hobby Lobby President Steve Green, whose case over the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraceptive mandate has reached the U.S. Supreme Court. In 2002, Green, acting through his family trust, purchased and then leased a vacant college campus to Gothard\u2019s ministry. A year later, Green, this time acting through Hobby Lobby itself, purchased a shuttered hospital in Little Rock, Ark., and donated it to Gothard for the purposes of building a local training center.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Green has not said anything about Gothard\u2019s predicament on the record. Neither have Huckabee or Van Zant, and it\u2019s not known whether any of Gothard\u2019s famous friends will continue their work with his ministry.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"admins": "756885656, 10150361922348092"}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0707\"", "article_summary": "Persistent allegations of sexual harassment and failure to report child abuse appear to have damaged the lengthy career of an influential Religious Right leader.\nITC, like all IBLP training centers, answered directly to Gothard and used his religious curriculum and disciplinary methods to work with minors.\nGothard had already been placed on leave pending an investigation into the allegations, which span the last three decades.\nJeb Bush, who promised to lead a \u201cmoral and spiritual awakening\u201d in the state during his inauguration in 1999, also had a fondness for Gothard\u2019s work.\nZack Kopplin\u2019s recent Slate expos\u00e9 of Responsive Education Solutions, a Texas-based charter school system, revealed that the ostensibly secular company lifted material directly from Gothard\u2019s curriculum and relied on IBLP buzzwords."}
