Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) played in making it happen have nuggets of information that show why I\u2019ve been harping about the possibility of impeachment since June. As the article on the revolt notes, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and his allies said they had the votes to pass a border bill that not only speeded up deportations but also had a $659 million price tag, which was considerably less than the $3.7 billion President Obama asked for. And then the bill was pulled from the floor \u2014 like so many others before it. ... With all the talk of Obama\u2019s lawlessness, his imperial presidency, his shredding of the Constitution, his acting like a king, his unwillingness to follow the laws as written by Congress, his use of executive action, etc., Boehner\u2019s caucus will be right to wonder why they aren\u2019t punishing him while he is still in office. This will especially be so if Republicans succeed in taking over the Senate in November. Once that happens, if past is prologue, Cruz will be leading the charge and Boehner will be powerless to stop him.\n\nIt's been obvious for years that Boehner is incapable of running the House effectively. It's also clear that the House likes it that way. Chaos suits them.\n\nDoyle McManus stares into that chaos.\n\nThe emergency immigration bill House Speaker John A. Boehner initially proposed last week was never going to become law \u2014 and he knew it. President Obama had already promised a veto, so the bill was mostly a political message, designed to show that House Republicans could act decisively in a crisis. Except they couldn't. Tea party conservatives revolted, demanding a chance to undo Obama's decision to defer deportations of young immigrants. And the speaker added to the picture of disarray by calling on Obama to use more executive power in the border crisis \u2014 only a few days after authorizing a lawsuit against the president for excessive use of executive power. The disaster was a public humiliation for both Boehner and his newly elevated majority leader, Kevin McCarthy (R-Bakersfield) \u2014 on McCarthy's first week in his new job. But it was only the most recent of many such battles in the House Republicans' unresolved civil war.\n\nNow, keep all this in mind as we move to the next bit.\n\nJonathan Turley looks at the mythology of impeachment.\n\nPeople pushing for President Obama\u2019s impeachment have cited rationales ranging from the border crisis to Benghazi to Obamacare to the dismantling of \u201cour constitutional republic, our national security, our electoral system, our economic strength, our rights and liberties.\u201d In other words, anything goes. This echoes the characterization by Gerald Ford, who as House minority leader in 1970 made the ill-considered statement that \u201can impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.\u201d (This interpretation was, not surprisingly, part of a frivolous effort to impeach Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas, whom Ford denounced for espousing \u201cliberal opinions,\u201d for defending the \u201cfilthy\u201d Swedish film \u201cI Am Curious (Yellow)\u201d and for writing a magazine article that \u201cpraises the lusty, lurid, and risque along with the social protest of left-wing folk singers.\u201d) ... But Congress\u2019s exclusive power to impeach does not license it to abuse that power, any more than the Supreme Court\u2019s final say on laws gives it license to deliver arbitrary rulings. The framers carefully defined the grounds for impeachment as \u201ctreason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors\u201d \u2014 language with British legal precedent. They clearly did not want removal of the president subject to congressional whim. Indeed, they rejected the addition of \u201cmaladministration\u201d after James Madison cautioned that \u201cso vague a term will be equivalent to a tenure during pleasure of the Senate.\u201d\n\nTurley's piece is your read-it-all assignment for the morning (yes, even though Turley has testified against President Obama more than once). However, note that Turley's conclusion is that Obama will not be impeached, first because he's not committed an impeachable offense and second because it wouldn't make political sense. To which I say, please review the Capehart and McManus pieces to see how much either of these things actually matter in the current House.\n\nAnd hey, the next time you read a piece about Gerald Ford, great healer of the nation, who did the right thing by forgiving Nixon, remember that Ford wasn't so eager to forgive when the person in his crosshairs was a liberal.\n\nSerge Schmemann does the political calculus on a trio of stories, including why this isn't just a repeat of every other time Israel went into Gaza.\n\nThis miniwar between Israel and Hamas is very different from previous ones. A central difference is in the way the \u201cArab spring\u201d has altered the political calculations of the Arab states and their feelings toward Hamas. Egypt, now back under military rulers hostile to Islamists, along with Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf autocracies, have not-so-secretly welcomed Israel\u2019s campaign to crush Hamas. That has reduced the ranks of mediators Washington can draw on to lean on the Islamic militants. Mahmoud Abbas, the leader in the West Bank, has little sway over Hamas, despite a purported political alliance formed in April; the United Nations, which joined Washington in seeking a cease-fire, has no credibility with Israel after decades of lopsided votes against the Jewish state. So Mr. Kerry has been compelled to work through Qatar and Turkey, two states that can still communicate with Hamas. But Hamas itself has no urgent reason to end the fighting. As in the past, the huge toll in civilian lives, along with the tragic strikes on schools, beaches and homes, have roused an international outcry against Israel. Hamas evidently believes that sustaining the fighting can eventually rouse enough international pressure on Israel to compel it to open Gaza and release Palestinian prisoners.\n\nIsrael... does not agree.\n\nRoger Cohen looks at why Americans continue to support Israel, even when almost no one else does.\n\nTo cross the Atlantic to America, as I did recently from London, is to move from one moral universe to its opposite in relation to Israel\u2019s war with Hamas in Gaza. Fury over Palestinian civilian casualties has risen to a fever pitch in Europe, moving beyond anti-Zionism into anti-Semitism (often a flimsy distinction). Attacks on Jews and synagogues are the work of a rabid fringe, but anger toward an Israel portrayed as indiscriminate in its brutality is widespread. ... In the United States, by contrast, support for Israel remains strong (although less so among the young, who are most exposed to the warring hashtags of social media). That support is overwhelming in political circles. Palestinian suffering remains near taboo in Congress. It is not only among American Jews, better organized and more outspoken than their whispering European counterparts, that the story of a nation of immigrants escaping persecution and rising from nowhere in the Holy Land resonates. The Israeli saga \u2014 of courage and will \u2014 echoes in American mythology, far beyond religious identification, be it Jewish or evangelical Christian. ... Oppressed people will respond. Millions of Palestinians are oppressed. They are routinely humiliated and live under Israeli dominion. When Jon Stewart is lionized (and slammed in some circles) for \u201crevealing\u201d Palestinian suffering to Americans, it suggests how hidden that suffering is. The way members of Congress have been falling over one another to demonstrate more vociferous support for Israel is a measure of a political climate not conducive to nuance. This hardly serves America\u2019s interests, which lie in a now infinitely distant peace between Israelis and Palestinians, and will require balanced American mediation.\n\nSorry, world. Get back to us when you need something blown up. More blown up.\n\nRuth Marcus looks at the ups, downs, and sidewayses of Richard Nixon.\n\nJust when you thought you could no longer be shocked by Nixon\u2019s willingness to abuse power, his seething resentments and paranoia and his florid anti-Semitism, another round of tapes emerges. ... In Watergate, the crime, it turns out, was even worse than the coverup. \u201cI want it implemented on a thievery basis,\u201d Nixon explodes at aides. \u201cGoddamn it, get in there and get those files. Blow the safe and get it.\u201d Nixon is referring to an earlier, aborted plan to burglarize the Brookings Institution. By the time of the break-in at the Democratic National Committee \u2014 and it took the bungling burglars several attempts \u2014 Nixon had already orchestrated a burglary at the office of Daniel Ellsberg\u2019s psychiatrist.\n\nMarcus shows how silly it is that \"-gate\" gets appended to every perceived political scandal, because nothing comes close to the levels of duplicity that encompassed Watergate. Or maybe... WMD-gate?\n\nLawrence Downes looks at how legalization is working out for Colorado.\n\nFor seven months Coloradans have been lawfully smoking joints and inhaling cannabis vapors, chewing marijuana-laced candies and chocolates, drinking, cooking and lotioning with products infused with cannabis oil. They are growing their own weed, making their own hash oil and stocking up at dispensaries marked with green crosses and words like \u201chealth,\u201d \u201cwellness\u201d and \u201cnatural remedies.\u201d Tourists are joining in \u2014 gawking, sampling and tripping in hotel rooms. Business is growing, taxes are flowing, cannabis entrepreneurs are building, investing and cashing in. Cannabis sales from January through May brought the state about $23.6 million in revenue from taxes, licenses and fees. That is not a huge amount in a $24 billion budget, but it\u2019s a lot more than zero, and it\u2019s money that was not pocketed by the black market. ... The ominously predicted harms from legalization \u2014 like blight, violence, soaring addiction rates and other ills \u2014 remain imaginary worries. Burglaries and robberies in Denver, in fact, are down from a year ago. The surge of investment and of jobs in construction, tourism and other industries, on the other hand, is real.\n\nDear other states, apparently you would rather spend taxes on overflowing prisons than to make money from legal sales tax. So... are you sure it's marijuana that makes you stupid?\n\nNASA isn't actually calling a holiday from the laws of physics, but...\n\nNasa is a major player in space science, so when a team from the agency this week presents evidence that \"impossible\" microwave thrusters seem to work, something strange is definitely going on. Either the results are completely wrong, or Nasa has confirmed a major breakthrough in space propulsion. ...a US scientist, Guido Fetta, has built his own propellant-less microwave thruster, and managed to persuade Nasa to test it out. The test results were presented on July 30 at the 50th Joint Propulsion Conference in Cleveland, Ohio. Astonishingly enough, they are positive. The Nasa team based at the Johnson Space Centre gave its paper the title \"Anomalous Thrust Production from an RF [radio frequency] Test Device Measured on a Low-Thrust Torsion Pendulum\".\n\nWhich may not sound like a revolution, be trust me, it is. Essentially, this is an unequal reaction -- thrust without propellant. Either that, or a big screw up in measurement, which at the moment is far more likely.
