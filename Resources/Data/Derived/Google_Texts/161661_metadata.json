Yeah, that\u2019s a great idea. Come on!\u201d\n\nAfter reading the suggestions, Fox and her cameraman read the instructions and discover the items were intended to spur discussion about how individual choices can affect the environment \u2014 which they see as evidence of liberal hypocrisy.\n\n\u201cInstead of teaching them an economic benefit to their behavior, they want to just mandate behavior and control,\u201d the unidentified cameraman says as Fox\u2019s eyes glaze over. \u201cAnd dictate and use guilt like an emotional thing instead of just economics of it \u2014 this would save you money if you did this.\u201d\n\nThe pair then complain about Obamacare, saying that exemption waivers are available to Democratic political donors and other favored liberals.\n\n\u201cWhat is eco-tourism?\u201d she asks about a suggestion on environmentally friendly vacations. \u201cIs that where you use recycled towels and things in a recycled hotel? And eat recycled food? Do people regurgitate it for you, and then you eat that? What is eco-tourism?\u201d\n\nShe also mocks suggestions about easily washed cotton clothing and buying clothing at thrift stores, saying Al Gore probably buys all of his suits at Brooks Brothers.\n\n\u201cWe shop at the thrift, but we shop there because it\u2019s economical,\u201d Fox says. \u201cWe don\u2019t shop there because we want to feel like good people. When we want to feel like good people, we are kind to one another \u2014 or we go to church.\u201d\n\nShe and her cameraman agree the suggestions for environmentally friendly living amount to a liberal Bible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like the 10 Commandments \u2014 it\u2019s made out of something heavy, like stone,\u201d Fox says, as she turns the pages to a book that\u2019s intended to remain outside and withstand the elements. \u201cThese are the commandments right here, we found them \u2014 the modern sins.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are the sins, and if you commit these sins, you must buy your carbon-credit indulgences,\u201d she adds, echoing an observation by her cameraman.\n\nFox, who is being sued for defamation by an employee of the Orland Park library over an ongoing dispute about online pornography, frequently claims that dinosaurs and reptiles are, in fact, dragons.\n\nShe has been posting links lately on her Facebook page of Christmas sweaters that show dinosaurs \u2013 which she offers as proof to various nonscientific claims.\n\n\u201cANOTHER SWEATER SHOWS ALTERNATIVE TAKE on dragons and what they eat,\u201d Fox wrote about a sweater showing a Tyrannosaurus rex eating a reindeer. \u201cThis one shows dragons and reindeer interacting. Can scientists prove this never happened?\u201d\n\nFox, in between posts about the library in a neighboring suburb and the spending habits of its employees, frequently complains about scientists and their methods.\n\nShe argued that the recent discovery of a species of frog in New Jersey should undercut any claims to authority by scientists.\n\n\u201cSure feels like there are a lot of scientists in New Jersey,\u201d Fox said. \u201cBut, they missed this frog for all those decades (if not centuries). A few things are always interesting to remember in moments like these: (1) scientists don\u2019t know everything and are \u2018surprised\u2019 by something seemingly every day; (2) there are more animals that exist that have not been \u2018discovered\u2019 than scientists would have you believe; (3) if scientists don\u2019t know about every animal alive right now then how could they know what animals existed back in the caveman prehistoric days?\u201d\n\nWatch part one of Fox\u2019s video audit of the Brookfield Zoo posted online:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Megan-Fox-800x430.png", "height": 430}, "title": "Homeschool mom who destroyed evolution at a museum heads to the zoo in search of dragons"}, "fb": {"app_id": 212555972273585}, "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=0.1, maximum-scale=10.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7a5d\"", "article_summary": "Megan Fox (YouTube)Science-hating homeschooling mom Megan Fox went looking for evidence of dragons and liberal bias \u2014 and found both \u2014 in her video \u201caudit\u201d of a suburban Chicago zoo.\n\u201cThere are tons of (displays) here that say, you know, humans are bad,\u201d Fox says.\n\u201cANOTHER SWEATER SHOWS ALTERNATIVE TAKE on dragons and what they eat,\u201d Fox wrote about a sweater showing a Tyrannosaurus rex eating a reindeer.\n\u201cCome on, this is laughable.\u201dShe mocks suggestions she encounters for conserving energy and natural resources as impractical and inconvenient.\nCome on!\u201dAfter reading the suggestions, Fox and her cameraman read the instructions and discover the items were intended to spur discussion about how individual choices can affect the environment \u2014 which they see as evidence of liberal hypocrisy."}
