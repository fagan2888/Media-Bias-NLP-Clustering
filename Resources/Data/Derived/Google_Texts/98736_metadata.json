Any U.S. drive to try to turn tribesmen against the militants, as the Americans did with Sunnis during the Iraq war, faces an uphill battle.\n\nSome tribes in Syria and Iraq already oppose the Islamic State group. For example, the Shammar tribe, which spans the countries\u2019 border, has fought alongside Kurdish forces against the extremists in Iraq. The U.S. and Iraqi governments have proposed creating a national guard program that would arm and pay tribesmen to fight, though the effort has yet to get off the ground.\n\nBut in Syria in particular, tribes have no outside patron to bankroll or arm them to take on IS, leaving them with few options other than to bend to Islamic State domination or flee.\n\n\u201cThere are people who want to go back and fight them,\u201d said Hassan Hassan, an analyst with the Delma Institute in Abu Dhabi. \u201cBut the circumstances now mean that you can\u2019t provoke ISIS because the strategy they\u2019ve followed and tactics are to prevent any revolt from inside.\u201d\n\nThe rulers of the self-styled caliphate have mastered techniques of divide and rule. Tribes are powerful institutions that command the loyalty of their members across the largely desert regions of Syria and Iraq. But they are also far from cohesive. Large tribes are divided up into smaller sub-tribes and clans that can be pitted against each other. Such divisions also emerge on their own, often in connection to control over local resources like oil wells or land.\n\nAlso, the Islamic State group itself has roots in the tribes. Though hundreds of foreign fighters have flocked to join the group, most of its leaders and foot soldiers are Iraqis and Syrians \u2014 and often belong to tribes.\n\nIn eastern Syria\u2019s Deir el-Zour province, for example, the Ogeidat is one of the largest tribes. One of its major clans, the Bu Jamel, has been a staunch opponent of the extremists. Another, the Bakir, long ago allied itself to the group.\n\nIS operatives use threats or offers of money or fuel to win public pledges of loyalty from senior tribal sheikhs. The group has also wooed younger tribesmen with economic enticements and promises of positions within IS, undermining the traditional power structure of the tribe.\n\n\u201cThey offer many sweeteners,\u201d said Abu Ali al-Badie, a tribal leader from the central city of Palmyra in Syria\u2019s Homs province. \u201cThey go to the tribes and say, \u2018Why are you fighting against Muslims? We\u2019ll give you weapons and cars and guns, and we\u2019ll fight together.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cThey offer diesel and fuel. They bring barley and animal feed from Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cThey build wells at their own expense for the tribes and they say, \u2018Others have neglected your needs.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn Syria, IS has won the acceptance of many tribesmen in Raqqa and Deir el-Zour provinces by ending chaos that reigned when the areas were controlled by a patchwork of rebel warlords. IS provides services including electricity, fuel, water and telephone lines, as well as flour for bakeries, said Haian Dukhan, a researcher at the University of St. Andrews Center for Syrian Studies.\n\n\u201cThings have started to become stable to a degree, and this is something that people were really desperate about,\u201d said Dukhan.\n\nThe group has \u201ctribal affairs\u201d officials to handle relations with the tribes, calibrating its style to local dynamics. Often they will allow loyal tribesmen to run their communities\u2019 services, said Hassan.\n\nThe group also has removed its own commanders who caused tension with tribes in their areas. The idea, Hassan said, is \u201cto remove some of the toxins.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the group sends a clear message to those who resist.\n\nIn August, IS militants shot and beheaded hundreds of members of the Shueitat tribe in eastern Syria. Activists reported death tolls ranging from 200 to 700. Photographs in the Islamic State\u2019s English-language \u201cDabiq\u201d magazine showed black-clad fighters shooting prisoners said to be Shueitat, lined up on the sandy ground.\n\nIn Iraq, IS killed more than 200 men, women and children from the Al Bu Nimr tribe in Anbar province, apparently in revenge for the tribe\u2019s siding with security forces and, in the past, with American troops. It has also shot dead several men from the Al Bu Fahd tribe.\n\n\u201cEveryone is hiding or fled. They will chop us in pieces if they see us,\u201d said Sheikh Naim al-Gaoud, a leader in the Al Bu Nimr. \u201cThey want us to support them and to join their fight. In return, they say they will let us live in peace.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Dukhan says there\u2019s little chance for a revolt unless tribes are confident the extremists are losing.\n\n\u201cI think that for the time being, seeing a large-scale uprising against IS is just a fantasy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Vivian Salama in Baghdad and Diaa Hadid in Beirut contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Islamic State group is employing multiple tactics to subdue the Sunni Muslim tribes in Syria and Iraq under its rule, wooing some with gifts \u2014 everything from cars to feed for their animals \u2014 while brutally suppressing those that resist with mass killings.", "Author": "Ryan Lucas", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Islamic State group is employing multiple tactics to subdue the Sunni Muslim tribes in Syria and Iraq under its rule, wooing some with gifts \u2014 everything from cars to feed for their animals \u2014 while brutally suppressing those that resist with mass killings.", "title": "Islamic State: With incentives and brute force, terror group subdues tribes", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/27/islamic-state-incentives-and-brute-force-terror-gr/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/23/mideast-islamic-state-child-soldiersjpeg-0266e.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/23/mideast-islamic-state-child-soldiersjpeg-0266e.jpg", "title": "Islamic State: With incentives and brute force, terror group subdues t", "description": "The Islamic State group is employing multiple tactics to subdue the Sunni Muslim tribes in Syria and Iraq under its rule, wooing some with gifts \u2014 everything from cars to feed for their animals \u2014 whil", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Environment, War Conflict, Syria, Iraq, Beirut"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd14d2\"", "article_summary": "Some tribes in Syria and Iraq already oppose the Islamic State group.\nAlso, the Islamic State group itself has roots in the tribes.\nTribes are powerful institutions that command the loyalty of their members across the largely desert regions of Syria and Iraq.\nFor example, the Shammar tribe, which spans the countries\u2019 border, has fought alongside Kurdish forces against the extremists in Iraq.\nBut in Syria in particular, tribes have no outside patron to bankroll or arm them to take on IS, leaving them with few options other than to bend to Islamic State domination or flee."}
