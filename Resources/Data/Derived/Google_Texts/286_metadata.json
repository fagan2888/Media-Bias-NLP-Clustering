Marco Rubio said Saturday he couldn\u2019t afford to be patient.\n\nTalking to a crowd of around 1,500 people at the Hilton Head Island High School gymnasium, Rubio, 44, said he bucked the GOP establishment in 2010 when he decided to run for the U.S. Senate and again last year when he opted to dive into the presidential race.\n\n\u201cThey told me \u2018You have to wait,\u2019 and my answer is \u2018Wait for what?\u2019\u201d the Florida senator said. \u201cAfter seven years of (President) Barack Obama, this is no time for patience. If we get this election wrong, there will be no turning back for America.\n\n\u201cThis nation cannot afford four years of Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nRubio was kicking off 2016 with several stops through South Carolina, the first southern state where votes will be cast in the presidential primaries and caucuses starting next month.\n\nHe spoke on the island after plane troubles forced postponement of an event planned Saturday morning in Easley, and he was scheduled to wrap up the day with a trip to Lexington.\n\nMaking his second appearance in Beaufort County since he announced his candidacy, Rubio spent most of his time lamenting that America has become \u201ca great nation in decline\u201d under the Obama administration.\n\nHe joined the other 10 Republicans still in the race in calling for a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and said Obama has been reckless on national defense and belittled financial success.\n\n\u201cIn 2008, this country unfortunately elected a president who wasn\u2019t interested in fixing the things going wrong; it elected a president who was interested in changing America,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cNow, we are told free enterprise is bad, that if you\u2019re successful financially, you must have cheated your workers. You must have cheated your customers.\u201d\n\nFocusing the bulk of his speech on national security, Rubio said \u201cgrotesque\u201d cuts to the U.S. military and intelligence agencies have weakened the nation\u2019s ability to fight terrorist groups such as the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThese defense cuts are doing zero, nothing, to balance our budget,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t carpet bomb ISIS if you don\u2019t have bombs and airplanes. We have a president who, instead of fighting to fund our military, would rather spend time fighting to fund Planned Parenthood. ISIS is killing people, burning people in cages, and we have a president who says the greatest risk we face in the world is climate change.\u201d\n\nRubio said America\u2019s security also depends how the country begins to address illegal immigration, an issue on which he has moved to the right after receiving criticism from fellow Republicans who have accused him of being in favor of amnesty.\n\nRubio\u2019s first trip to Hilton Head in November came shortly after Republican candidate Sen. Ted Cruz noted Rubio\u2019s involvement in the 2013 \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill that sought immigration reform and included a path to citizenship.\n\nAt the time, Rubio shot back, pointing out that Cruz proposed a legalization amendment and a massive expansion of the federal green card program.\n\nA son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio said he has a better understanding of the issue than any other candidate. He added he would not support amnesty and is now in favor of building 700 miles of fencing along the Mexican border.\n\n\u201cImmigration is no longer about simply people coming here for a better job and life; it has become a national security issue, where terrorists are utilizing the loopholes in our system,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWhen things in our lives change, we need to change the way we react. We need to change the way we treat even legal immigration now, too.\u201d\n\nRubio drew a comparison to \u201ca time when nobody ever locked their doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow everybody locks their doors because society has changed,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t lock our doors because we hate the people outside of our home. We lock our doors because we love the people inside of our home.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m president, we\u2019re going to be guided by a very simple principle. If we\u2019re not 100 percent certain of who you are and why you\u2019re coming, you cannot come into the United States.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Bluffton News, Bluffton, South Carolina", "og": {"site_name": "Bluffton Today", "description": "Despite being told by his party's establishment wing he was too young or not ready to run for president, Republican hopeful Sen.
