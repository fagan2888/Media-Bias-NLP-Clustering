Still, I can\u2019t imagine accompanying my bearded 20-something son on a job interview. I may be in the minority here because taking Mom and Dad on job searches and to interviews appears to be a weird new trend.\n\nAccording to a 2012 survey of more than 500 college graduates, 8 percent said they had a parent go with them to a job interview. And 3 percent had Mom or Dad sit in on the actual interview, according to Adecco, a human resources firm, which conducted the study.\n\nAnother study from the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers said 6 percent of recent U.S. college graduates wanted their parents to get a copy of their job offer letter and 2 percent wanted their parents to get a copy of their performance review. That study polled 44,000 people from more than 20 countries, a report in the Wall Street Journal said.\n\nApparently, I\u2019m not the only one puzzled by the growing practice of parents escorting their college graduates to job interviews.\n\n\u201cIt seems nutty,\u201d John Challenger, CEO of the human resources consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, in Chicago, tells me. \u201cIt would cause most employers to downgrade the candidacy of someone. They\u2019re looking for someone who\u2019s able to act on their own, independently. Bringing your parents to an interview is absurd.\u201d\n\nThe Journal says some companies are encouraging parental involvement to attract and retain Millennials \u2013 kids born between 1981 and the early 2000s \u2013 particularly as they make the transition from college to the workplace.\n\nGoogle just held its second \u201cTake Your Parents to Work Day,\u201d hosting more than 2,000 parents at its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters, the Journal reported.\n\nLinkedIn, the social media website for professionals, will host its first \u201cBring In Your Parents Day\u201d in November at its offices in 14 countries. Spokeswoman Danielle Restivo told the paper that employees who have their parents\u2019 support are happier.\n\nNorthwestern Mutual, a Milwaukee-based financial firm, routinely invites the parents of college-aged interns for open houses. Some managers let parents come along to interviews and hear details of job offers. Coddling Junior, and his parents, have worked out well for the company. The number of interns who\u2019ve met sales targets rose more than 40 percent since 2007, the Journal said.\n\nChallenger says companies that invite parents to their kids\u2019 workplace usually have a larger share of younger workers. He says it\u2019s an extension of company practices that have included inviting workers\u2019 spouses to dinner and other social events.\n\n\u201cCompanies are looking for ways to create tighter bonds among employees to build culture, to tie families to the work environment. It helps to retain workers,\u201d Challenger says. \u201cYou\u2019re more likely to see this at companies with young workers. If I brought my 87-year-old dad in to my office, he\u2019d have to come in with a walker.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Ryan Hsuh31/Flickr\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Ok, so maybe some of us baby boomers deserve the \u201chelicopter parents\u201d label for the way we hover over our kids.
