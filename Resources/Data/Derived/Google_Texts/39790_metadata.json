He urged voters to \u201cdo their homework\u201d and \u201cuse their common sense.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI think people a lot of times do ultimately look at \u2018pocketbook issues,\u2019\u201d Chabot said. \u201cI\u2019d say for probably two-thirds of the people ultimately it will come down to the economy, who they think is best positioned to improve the economy because the economy probably effects their family as much or more than anything else does.\u201d\n\nThe Ohio Republican has been a member of the House Small Business Committee for 20 years and has spent the past two years as its chair. He was the ranking member of the committee for two years before that.\n\nThree big issues plague small-business owners, according to Chabot, including: overregulation and red tape, taxes, and access to capital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to repeal Dodd-Frank or to modify it to get rid of some of the worse things about it for a few years now,\u201d Chabot said of the controversial finance law signed by President Barack Obama in 2010, adding that the modifications he\u2019d like to see are able to be passed in the House but not in the Senate.\n\n\u201cEven if we got it through the Senate, the president would likely veto it because he likes Dodd-Frank, because it\u2019s one of his accomplishments kind of like Obamacare,\u201d the congressman continued. \u201cGetting back to regulations, that\u2019s another piece of legislation that has made it much tougher on small-business folks now \u2014 much more expensive, harder for them to provide insurance for their employees.\u201d\n\nHe argued that Americans are now receiving \u201cinferior health care\u201d under Obamacare and advocated \u201cthat\u2019s another thing we need to get rid of to help small-business owners across the country.\u201d\n\nWhile Chabot has called GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump\u2019s call for a moratorium on Muslim immigrants \u201cill-advised,\u201d he has said he will support the billionaire businessman should he secure the Republican Party\u2019s nomination.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Kaitlyn Schallhorn (@K_Schallhorn) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;
