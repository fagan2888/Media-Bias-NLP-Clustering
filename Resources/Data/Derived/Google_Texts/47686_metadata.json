His love and dedication for Dalmatians is well known throughout his hometown of Santiago, Chile where he is called the \u201cDalmatian Man,\u201d a name he got from the 42 liver spotted canines living in his backyard. Vergara is so obsessed with the popular breed that he even painted black dots on his white van.\n\n\u201cIt all started because of that film,\u201d Vergara says. \u201cThat was computer-generated. But I wanted to do the real thing.\u201d But the true reasons behind his passion is to save the millions of stray dogs which roam Chile\u2019s streets every day. The number rises even further during working hours when pet owners leave their dogs outside. These dogs are not very well taken care of either \u2013 they are never sprayed for fleas or neutered. Vergara\u2019s intentions are purely humanitarian for he wants to raise awareness about the growing number of stray dogs which the country\u2019s Humane Society considers alarming.\n\nSo far, Vergara has rescued all the starving and sick dogs he found; he fed and took care of them with donations since he doesn\u2019t have a paying job. His goal is to help all unfortunate dogs, not only Dalmatians. \u201cI wanted to help \u2013 not just the Dalmatians but all dogs, because in Chile we need a solution to the canine problem,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery day you see news of abandoned dogs roaming, but no one does anything about it. If we had a shelter, we wouldn\u2019t have these kinds of problems,\u201d Vergara states.\n\nUnfortunately, all his hard work might have been in vain \u2013 neighbors constantly complain about the noise and smell coming from his modest home and he and his dogs risk being evicted. If this were the 1996 Disney movie, Vergara\u2019s story would have a happy ending, but since he\u2019s a real-life dog lover we can only hope that the 55-year-old hippy with green, yellow and red bands in his hair will be allowed to keep his home along with his 42 Dalmatians.\n\nPhotos: El Mercurio via El Salvador\n\nSource: Associated Press", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chilean Nelson Vergara earned the nickname \"Dalmatian Man\" after he became inspired by Disney's 101 Dalmatians and started taking in as many stray dalmatian", "og": {"site_name": "Oddity Central", "description": "Chilean Nelson Vergara earned the nickname \"Dalmatian Man\" after he became inspired by Disney's 101 Dalmatians and started taking in as many stray dalmatian dogs as he could find", "title": "Disney\u2019s 101 Dalmatians Inspires Dog Lover to Take in as Many Spotted Canines as He Can Find | Oddity Central - Collecting Oddities", "url": "http://www.odditycentral.com/animals/disneys-101-dalmatians-inspires-dog-lover-to-take-in-as-many-spotted-canines-as-he-can-find.html", "image": "http://www.odditycentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Nelson-Vergara-550x355.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.odditycentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Nelson-Vergara-550x355.jpg", "description": "Chilean Nelson Vergara earned the nickname \"Dalmatian Man\" after he became inspired by Disney's 101 Dalmatians and started taking in as many stray dalmatian dogs as he could find", "card": "summary", "title": "Disney\u2019s 101 Dalmatians Inspires Dog Lover to Take in as Many Spotted Canines as He Can Find | Oddity Central - Collecting Oddities"}, "fb": {"admins": 597853801}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-14T11:45:38Z", "modified_time": "2013-10-14T11:45:38Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd23f\"", "article_summary": "Nelson Vergara loved the movie \u201c101 Dalmatians\u201d so much that after watching it, he couldn\u2019t help himself from adopting any spotted dog that crossed his path.\nVergara\u2019s intentions are purely humanitarian for he wants to raise awareness about the growing number of stray dogs which the country\u2019s Humane Society considers alarming.\n\u201cI wanted to help \u2013 not just the Dalmatians but all dogs, because in Chile we need a solution to the canine problem,\u201d he says.\nBut I wanted to do the real thing.\u201d But the true reasons behind his passion is to save the millions of stray dogs which roam Chile\u2019s streets every day.\nHis goal is to help all unfortunate dogs, not only Dalmatians."}
