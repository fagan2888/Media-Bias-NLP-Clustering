It isn\u2019t good.\n\nIn six separate columns addressing the Obama claim\u2019s truthfulness between 2008 and 2012, the Tampa Bay Times\u2019 influential fact-checking group did not once correctly label it as false.\n\nThis was despite ample evidence to the contrary \u2014 often noted in those same columns. Their harshest judgments were that his promise was \u201chalf true.\u201d Even those rulings were grudging.\n\nThe first of these six Politifact columns ran Oct. 7, 2008, and evaluated Obama's comment, \u201c[I]f you've got a health care plan that you like, you can keep it.\u201d It rated this as \u201ctrue\u201d since Obama was \u201caccurately describing his [then-proposed] health care plan.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it was grading him on the basis of \u201cDid he really promise this?\u201d and not the more relevant \u201cIs this a plausible promise?\u201d\n\nPolitifact followed up on Aug. 11, 2009, when Obama said: \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.\u201d\n\nThis time there was legislation to evaluate and Politifact conceded: \u201cIt's not realistic for Obama to make blanket statements that \u2018you\u2019 will be able to \u2018keep your health care plan.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat would undermine Obama\u2019s claim, right? Not according to Politifact, which stated: \u201c[O]ne of the points of reform is to change the way health care works right now. So we rate Obama's statement Half True.\u201d\n\nThat may have been \u201cone of the points of reform\u201d but that was not relevant to Obama's claim. Politifact was simply moving the goalposts.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.created": "11-05-13", "dc.format": "text/html", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dcterms.modified": "11-05-13", "og": {"url": "http://nation.foxnews.com/2013/11/05/never-trust-politifact-again", "type": "article", "image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/pinocchio_1.jpg", "site_name": "FoxNation.com", "title": "Never Trust Politifact Again"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://nation.foxnews.com/sites/nation.foxnews.com/files/styles/story_624_300/public/pinocchio_1.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:cGFnZTE=", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"title\":\"Never Trust Politifact Again \",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2013\\/11\\/05\\/never-trust-politifact-again\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/pinocchio_1.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox News\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-05T09:38:21-05:00\",\"identifier\":\"58552\"}", "prism.section": "nation", "dc.date": "2016-05-25", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Never Trust Politifact Again \",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/2013\\/11\\/05\\/never-trust-politifact-again\",\"image_url\":\"http:\\/\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/sites\\/nation.foxnews.com\\/files\\/styles\\/story_624_300\\/public\\/pinocchio_1.jpg\",\"section\":\"nation\",\"author\":\"Fox Nation\",\"tags\":[],\"type\":\"article\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-05T09:38:21-05:00\",\"post_id\":\"58552\"}", "fb": {"admins": 100000924384522, "app_id": 155242997843474}, "dc.language": "en-US", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "dc.title": "Never Trust Politifact Again"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd858\"", "article_summary": "Not according to Politifact, which stated: \u201c[O]ne of the points of reform is to change the way health care works right now.\nSo we rate Obama's statement Half True.\u201dThat may have been \u201cone of the points of reform\u201d but that was not relevant to Obama's claim.\nPolitifact was simply moving the goalposts.\nTheir harshest judgments were that his promise was \u201chalf true.\u201d Even those rulings were grudging.\nIn six separate columns addressing the Obama claim\u2019s truthfulness between 2008 and 2012, the Tampa Bay Times\u2019 influential fact-checking group did not once correctly label it as false."}
