Hurst officials are investigating after a RaceTrac fuel truck burst into flames on Loop 820, killing the driver.

The fire was reported just after 5:30 a.m. on Loop 820, near Highway 10.

A nearby hotel evacuated, and Highway 10 and Loop 820 were closed for several hours while the fuel burned.

Officials confirmed later that the driver died, but didn’t release a name.

A RaceTrac spokeswoman said the tanker was owned by Energy Dispatch, which transports fuel to RaceTrac and RaceWay.

“The Energy Dispatch family is saddened by the death of our team member and our thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and fellow team members during this difficult time,” the spokeswoman wrote in an emailed statement.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call Hurst police at 817-788-7149.
