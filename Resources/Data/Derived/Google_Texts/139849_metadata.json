A vote against the resolution could be used to paint contenders as weak on national security, which has fast become the No. 1 concern among voters, and force candidates not in the Senate to comment on the proposal. A vote on the AUMF has a potential political benefit for McConnell, as well. Such a highly-charged vote will no doubt make it into campaign ads this November when Republicans will be fighting to maintain their Senate majority.\n\nRelated: From Duck Hunter to Pawn Star, Reality TV Celebs Line Up for the GOP\n\nIt could also have an impact on the Democratic Party primary, as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton seeks to blunt the momentum of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in the early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire by focusing on foreign policy. A \u2018no\u2019 vote by Sanders would give Clinton a new opening to paint Sanders as too unproven to destroy ISIS.\n\nThe proposal goes far beyond the AUMF President Obama submitted to Congress nearly a year ago. That resolution arrived with a thud, as members reacted to language prohibiting \u201cenduring\u201d ground operations. Republicans argued the vague text boxed in military leaders, while Democrats thought it opened the door to another long-term U.S. commitment in the Middle East. The AUMF also expired after three years, unless reauthorized.\n\nRelated: What the Liberal Attacks on Bernie Sanders Are Really About\n\nSince then, multiple war powers resolutions have been floated by both parties, none of which gained traction.\n\nEarlier this month House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) tasked key committee chairs with holding \u201clistening sessions\u201d to determine what rank-and-file members would like to see an AUMF, though some thought the push would ultimately prove futile since McConnell previously played down the idea of taking up a resolution in the last year of Obama\u2019s presidency, making his move on Thursday all the more surprising.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Lindsey Graham is poised to influence the 2016 presidential election in a way he never did as a White House contender.", "title": "Congress May Finally Authorize Force Against ISIS, with Help from Lindsey Graham", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/22/Congress-May-Finally-Authorize-Force-Against-ISIS-Help-Lindsey-Graham", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07102013_Congress_Clouds_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/01/22/Congress-May-Finally-Authorize-Force-Against-ISIS-Help-Lindsey-Graham", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/07102013_Congress_Clouds_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Lindsey Graham is poised to influence the 2016 presidential election in a way he never did as a White House contender.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5a9f\"", "article_summary": "A \u2018no\u2019 vote by Sanders would give Clinton a new opening to paint Sanders as too unproven to destroy ISIS.\nLindsey Graham is poised to influence the 2016 presidential election in a way he never did as a White House contender.\nA vote against the resolution could be used to paint contenders as weak on national security, which has fast become the No.\n1 concern among voters, and force candidates not in the Senate to comment on the proposal.\nThe proposal goes far beyond the AUMF President Obama submitted to Congress nearly a year ago."}
