But the president decided to give himself a gift anyway - a trip to California ending up with a dinner at the posh Annenberg ranch in California with King Abudllah of Jordan.\n\nOn Friday afternoon he'll travel to Fresno, to discuss the devastating drought with farmers, and he'll finish off the day over a dinner with King Abdullah II of Jordan at Sunnylands, the Annenberg ranch in Rancho Mirage, Calif. The President will remain at the desert retreat for a weekend of golfing. The Obama ladies have separate plans for Presidents Day Weekend. They will be \"be away on their own travels,\" the New York Times reported. The first couple actually already had their Valentine's Date, on Feb. 8, with a meal at Oyamel, a Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s restaurant in D.C. In 2013, President Obama traveled to Georgia for a speech on Valentine's Day but arrived home in time to take his wife to Minibar, another Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s restaurant, in Penn Quarter.\n\nWhile he's jetting off to California at taxpayer's expense, Investors Business Daily reminds us what he's leaving behind:\n\n\"The king is going out to California,\" Carney announced. He might have been referring to King Abdullah II of Jordan, who is scheduled to meet Obama in Rancho Mirage, but we're not sure. Never mind the House of Representatives had to pass a debt ceiling extension on Tuesday to avoid hitting the limit in two weeks. Never mind that the national debt has increased $6.6 trillion under Obama. Never mind the national debt is $17,263,025,875,604.41. Never mind that median household income is 4.4%, or $2,500, less since Obama's \"recovery\" began. Never mind that the average health insurance premium has risen $2,500 since ObamaCare became law. Never mind that the share of underemployed has climbed to 17.7%. Never mind that the payroll-to-population rate dropped to 42% from 63.5% in January 2010. Never mind that 46.5 million Americans are living in poverty. Never mind that this is the worst recovery in U.S. history. Never mind most American families can't afford to jet off to separate vacations over Presidents Day weekend. Let's just hope these trips are cheaper than the $100 million sojourn the Obamas took to Africa during sequestration last year, or the quarter-million-dollar \"date night\" Barack and Michelle enjoyed in New York in 2009. But as president, Obama reminded us recently, you \"can do whatever you want.\" It's good to be king.\n\nNo doubt in between bites with His Royal Highness, the president will ask for some royal pointers on what a king might do. He's actually running out of things he can screw up so \"doing whatever you want\" becomes a matter of state.\n\nEditor Lifson points out that just as Washington is going into a deep freeze, the president jets off to sunny California to play some golf.\n\nI'm sure it's just a coincidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/02/obamas_valentines_day_gift_to_himself_dinner_with_royalty_without_michelle.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/assets/images/at-painter-og-image.png", "title": "Blog: Obama's Valentine's Day gift to himself; dinner with royalty without Michelle"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd150a\"", "article_summary": "According to the New York Post, the Obamas have already had their Valentine's Day night out - on February 8.\nIn 2013, President Obama traveled to Georgia for a speech on Valentine's Day but arrived home in time to take his wife to Minibar, another Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s restaurant, in Penn Quarter.\nNever mind most American families can't afford to jet off to separate vacations over Presidents Day weekend.\nThe Obama ladies have separate plans for Presidents Day Weekend.\nBut as president, Obama reminded us recently, you \"can do whatever you want.\""}
