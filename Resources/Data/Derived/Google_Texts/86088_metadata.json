Those data\u2019s release highlighted the reality that American health care prices are completely arbitrary, with some hospitals charging more than 10 times for the same service as other hospitals in the same region do.\n\nBlum says that the doctor payment data can empower consumers by giving them another tool to assess whether or not they\u2019re getting the most efficient care. \u201cData like these can shine a light on how care is delivered in the Medicare program,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey can help consumers compare the services provided and payments received by individual health care providers. Businesses and consumers alike can use these data to drive decision-making and reward quality, cost-effective care.\u201d\n\nDoctors\u2019 groups warned that the planned data release is far too broad and could actually improperly bias patients against quality physicians. \u201cThe AMA is concerned that CMS\u2019 broad approach to releasing physician payment data will mislead the public into making inappropriate and potentially harmful treatment decisions and will result in unwarranted bias against physicians that can destroy careers,\u201d said AMA president Dr. Ardis Dee Hoven in a statemet.\n\nHealth care price transparency has become an increasingly important issue as the Affordable Care Act is implemented. The health law contains provisions that penalize medical providers who perform too many unnecessary tests or don\u2019t see a significant improvement in patient wellness. Some states are also working to make health care price and insurance payment data more readily available. For instance, North Carolina passed a law requiring the state\u2019s hospitals to disclose how much they charge and how much various insurance companies pay them for 140 common medical procedures.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The administration will release Medicare payment data for nearly one million physicians for the first time in history in an effort to help consumers make better choices.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The administration will release Medicare payment data for nearly one million physicians for the first time in history in an effort to help consumers make better choices.", "title": "Obama Administration Takes Big Step Towards Making Health Care More Transparent", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/04/03/3422418/medicare-doctor-payments-to-be-released/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/doc-money-e1396527662893.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The administration will release Medicare payment data for nearly one million physicians for the first time in history in an effort to help consumers make better choices.", "creator": "@the_sy_guy", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/doc-money-e1396527662893-321x214.jpg", "title": "Obama Administration Takes Big Step Towards Making Health Care More Transparent", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/doc-money-e1396527662893.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/doc-money-e1396527662893.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-04-03T09:00:54+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fded2d\"", "article_summary": "Health care price transparency has become an increasingly important issue as the Affordable Care Act is implemented.\nSome states are also working to make health care price and insurance payment data more readily available.\nHealth Obama Administration Takes Big Step Towards Making Health Care More Transparent CREDIT: ShutterstockThe Obama administration on Wednesday announced in a letter to the American Medical Association (AMA) that it will release Medicare payment data for nearly one million physicians for the first time in American history in an effort to make U.S. health care more transparent and encourage consumers to make better choices.\n\u201cThey can help consumers compare the services provided and payments received by individual health care providers.\nBlum says that the doctor payment data can empower consumers by giving them another tool to assess whether or not they\u2019re getting the most efficient care."}
