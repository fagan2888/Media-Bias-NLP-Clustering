A legitimate question is \u2014 is the American public ready to move from the system we have now \u2014 yes we have high deductibles for many people, yes they are paying high premiums \u2014 but are we willing to move and float all of the those expenses through the government coffers and pay much higher payroll taxes and much higher income taxes?\u201d\n\nRehm asks Rovner \u2014 what would Bernie Sanders proposal cost?\n\n\u201cA lot more than he has floated in income tax increases,\u201d Rovner said. \u201cThe Urban Institute last week estimated that it is $18 trillion short of paying for itself.\u201d\n\nWith that statement, Rovner gave the back of her corporate hand to David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler, who recently wrote that the Urban Institute\u2019s estimates \u201care ridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey project outlandish increases in the utilization of medical care, ignore vast savings under single-payer reform, and ignore the extensive and well-documented experience with single-payer systems in other nations \u2014 which all spend far less per person on healthcare than we do,\u201d they wrote.\n\nRovner said that \u201cit\u2019s important to know that what Bernie Sanders is proposing is not what Medicare is.\u201d\n\n\u201cMedicare as it exists today has lots and lots of requirements for patients for co-pays,\u201d Rovner said. \u201cThe deductibles are not that high in Medicare, although the hospital deductible is substantial. But the ongoing out of pocket costs can be enormous. That\u2019s why most people who have Medicare have supplemental insurance. What Bernie Sanders is talking about is that there would be no need for supplemental insurance \u2014 that this new Medicare would pay pretty much for everything. That is what would make it so expensive. And that would be a level that even other countries who have single payer plans don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nIgnoring the results of the Gallup poll, Armour says that while single payer \u201chas intrigued people for decades, it has never gotten a majority of support and in the current political climate, it would be very difficult.\u201d\n\nGiven that Rehm had three guests dissing single payer, she felt she had to stand up for it. Since when, she asked, did Congress start ignoring \u201cwhat people want\u201d?\n\nArmour said that while single payer has always had strong support, \u201cit\u2019s been a plurality, not a majority.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere simply isn\u2019t fifty percent plus one and there hasn\u2019t been,\u201d Armour said. \u201cWhat we are seeing now is the other side \u2014 give people more skin in the game. Make them pay more of their own health care bills. And maybe they will shop better.\u201d\n\nShop better? You mean like in states like West Virginia where there is exactly one insurance company in the Obamacare marketplace?\n\nShop better?\n\nThe last time the Diane Rehm show devoted an hour to single payer was in May 2009.\n\nThe guests were Bernie Sanders, David Himmelstein, Roger Hickey \u2014 who was pushing a public option \u2014 and Susan Dentzer, who was then identified as senior policy adviser, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and on-air analyst on health issues, PBS NewsHour.\n\nDuring that show, Rehm asked Dentzer why we don\u2019t have a single payer system in the United States and Dentzer replied \u2014 \u201cwe had a private insurance industry develop.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt now has revenues in excess of $400 billion a year. And it\u2019s a very effective interest group,\u201d Dentzer said.\n\nDentzer should know.\n\nWhile Dentzer\u2019s group calls itself The Network for Excellence in Health Innovation, in fact if you look at its board of directors, it\u2019s dominated by executives affiliated with health insurance companies (Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and HCA) and drug companies (Genzyme Corporation, Sanofi and Merck.)", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 3.8.14", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The last time the Diane Rehm show devoted an hour to single payer was in May 2009.\n\u201cBernie Sanders Medicare for All program would create a single payer system,\u201d Dentzer said.\nIn response, Armour, Dentzer and Rovner all talked about how much more expensive single payer would be than Obamacare.\nOnly Diane Rehm seemed sympathetic to single payer.\nBut single payer wasn\u2019t raised as a possibility by any of the guests \u2014 until a caller raised it about three quarters of the way through the show."}
