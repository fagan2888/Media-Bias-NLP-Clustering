Now, a new study suggests many of the guidelines that offer physicians a moral toolkit may need revising.\n\nPatient records aren\u2019t confined to clipboards hung on exam room doors anymore. In today\u2019s Information Age, people are migrating their lives online, which means doctors have nearly limitless opportunities to learn about the people they care for. Sometimes that means changing direction in treatment. Sometimes it means denying it altogether. Until now, drawing the line at what is acceptable to look up has been a perplexing task.\n\n\"As time goes on, Googling patients is going to become more and more common, especially with doctors who grew up with the Internet,\" said Maria J. Baker, associate professor of medicine at Penn State College of Medicine lead study author, in a statement. Baker found inspiration for the recent report from a woman who had faked a cancer diagnosis in order to drum up fundraising money. Since the patient\u2019s family history couldn\u2019t be verified, Baker, a medical geneticist, turned to Google to see if she could shed any light on the issue. That\u2019s when she realized the scam.\n\nNot all cases will end this way. It\u2019s entirely possible a curious doctor could find nothing but personal details about the patient, in which case the doctor may be undermining the patient\u2019s assumption of trust. \"Health care providers need guidance on when they should do it and how they should deal with what they learn,\" Baker said. In the report she co-authored with two of her colleagues, the team calls for a clearer set of prescriptions for deciding when physicians should and shouldn\u2019t Google.\n\nThey outline 10 criteria:\n\nDuty to re-contact/warn patient of possible harm\n\nEvidence of doctor shopping \u2014 visiting different doctors until a desired outcome is acquired.\n\nEvasive responses to logical clinical questions\n\nClaims in a patient's personal or family history that seem improbable\n\nDiscrepancies between a patient's verbal history and clinical documentation\n\nLevels of urgency/aggressiveness are not justified by clinical assessment\n\nReceipt of discrediting information from other reliable health professionals that calls the patient's story into question\n\nInconsistent statements by the patient, or between a patient and their family members\n\nSuspicions regarding physical and/or substance abuse\n\nConcerns regarding suicide risk\n\nBehind the dilemma of \u201cTo Google or not to Google\u201d is a decidedly more complex change in how doctors interact with their patients. Before the Internet gave physicians such robust access to their patients\u2019 lives, they had to rely on what they were told. From these self-reports they formed hard opinions on which diagnoses they could rule out, which treatment methods were superior, and, ultimately, how the patient\u2019s future might look. That dynamic is changing.\n\nGoogle has produced a \u201cblind spot,\u201d Baker says. The Hippocratic Oath demands that doctors do no harm, but what happens when patients\u2019 own inconsistencies, however intentional, put them in harm\u2019s way? \"We're hoping that by offering scenarios that raise important ethical questions about the use of search engine technology, we can initiate a conversation that results in the eventual development of professional guidelines,\" Baker said. \"What are the justifications? How is this information that you might potentially learn going to impact the patient-provider relationship and how are you going to document the information about the patient that you might learn?\"\n\nWhile most medical societies do have rules on the books that outline how doctors should use social media and the Internet, they lack a set of formal guidelines specific to patient information. The addition Baker and her colleagues suggest is overdue, they contend.\n\n\"Any professional medical society's policy statements on the use of the Internet and social media \u2014 which they should all have \u2014 should undergo revision to help provide guidance to their various health care providers.\"\n\nSource: Baker M, George D, Kauffman Jr. G.
