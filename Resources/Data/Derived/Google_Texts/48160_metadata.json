Over the years, we\u2019ve seen servicemen and women, athletes, heroes, astronauts and survivors. Many times, the President references them specifically in his address.\n\nThe White House says the special guests for this year\u2019s address represent progress that has been made since the President\u2019s first State of the Union.\n\nGovernor Malloy, according to the White House, has initiatives and ideas that are in line with some of the President\u2019s priorities, from criminal justice reforms, gun safety laws and raising the minimum wage to $10.10.\n\nMalloy released a statement in response to the White House\u2019s invitation to sit in First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s box at President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly an honor. I want to thank the President and the First Lady for this once-in-a-lifetime invitation. We\u2019re doing big things in Connecticut. We\u2019ve passed the smartest gun law in the nation, and we\u2019ve helped drive a national conversation to help prevent gun violence. The President is taking action on this important issue just as we have in Connecticut \u2013 it is commonsense to keep guns out of the hands of those who shouldn\u2019t have them. We\u2019re proud of that record, just as we are proud of the myriad other initiatives Connecticut has led on, from Second Chance, to being the first state in the nation to raise the minimum wage to $10.10, to the first state to pass paid sick days, to launching a first-in-the-nation green bank to tackle global warming, to the best implementation of the Affordable Care Act in America. Connecticut has an amazing story to tell over the past few years \u2013 and we\u2019re proud to tell it.\u201d\n\nYou can see the President\u2019s State of the Union followed by the Republican response Tuesday night on News 8, starting at 9 p.m.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "ct news, connecticut news, president obama, barack obama, first lady, michelle obama, governor, dannel malloy, state of the union, guest, white house, invited, malloy to DC", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488522642", "og": {"site_name": "WTNH Connecticut News", "description": "Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy will attend Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address in Washington DC, as a guest of the President.", "title": "Malloy to attend State of the Union as Obama\u2019s guest", "url": "http://wtnh.com/2016/01/10/malloy-to-attend-state-of-the-union-as-obamas-guest/", "image": {"width": 660, "identifier": "https://lintvwtnh.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/malloy-obama-rally.jpg?w=1200", "height": 371}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy will attend Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address in Washington DC, as a guest of the President.", "title": "Malloy to attend State of the Union as Obama\u2019s guest", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwtnh.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/malloy-obama-rally.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WTNH", "site": "@wtnh", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "ct news, connecticut news, president obama, barack obama, first lady, michelle obama, governor, dannel malloy, state of the union, guest, white house, invited, malloy to DC", "msapplication-tooltip": "Connecticut News, CT Weather, Conn Traffic and Roads", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wtnh", "fb": {"pages": 48010180735}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtnh.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/4eb8f03fcc8a8756ac275dd34c27b214?s=16", "application-name": "WTNH Connecticut News", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WTNH8", "published_time": "2016-01-10T05:01:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-10T16:51:22+00:00"}, "msvalidate.01": "25404283363C09DE121A55A903F03873", "google-site-verification": "ZhFDO7qoefSEo7HNtJIuKwhzd9Scb3I7EiPvU_GALiE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy will attend Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address in Washington DC, as a guest of the President."}, "article_summary": "WASHINGTON (WTNH) \u2014 Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy will attend Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address in Washington DC, as a guest of the President.\nMalloy released a statement in response to the White House\u2019s invitation to sit in First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s box at President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address:\u201cIt\u2019s truly an honor.\nThe White House says the special guests for this year\u2019s address represent progress that has been made since the President\u2019s first State of the Union.\nEvery year, the White House invites a number of special guests to sit with the first lady.\nGovernor Malloy, according to the White House, has initiatives and ideas that are in line with some of the President\u2019s priorities, from criminal justice reforms, gun safety laws and raising the minimum wage to $10.10."}
