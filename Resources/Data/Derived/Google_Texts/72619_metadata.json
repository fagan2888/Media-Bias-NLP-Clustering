Seriously. I mean it. This is huge. And nobody wants to talk about it.\n\nOK, it\u2019s actually more complicated than that. Other potential explanations paint an even less flattering picture of the current conservative conspiracy craze. But whatever it is, conservatives\u2014at least in the current political moment\u2014are significantly more prone to embrace conspiracy theories, and the more they know, the more they embrace them\u2026 at least if the conspiracies make liberals look bad. The same is not true of liberals\u2014at least not now\u2014according to a new paper published in the American Journal of Political Science that takes some major strides toward making sense of conspiracy theories as less of a puzzling black sheep phenomenon than it\u2019s usually taken to be.\n\nWhile a lot of recent progress has been made in understanding the psychological underpinnings of conspiracy endorsement, the ideological dynamics have lagged behind until now. The new paper, \u201cConspiracy Endorsement as Motivated Reasoning: The Moderating Roles of Political Knowledge and Trust,\u201d makes a promising start in catching up and pointing the way for future research. It may also shed light on what\u2019s happening in the unfolding GOP primary.\n\nLead co-author Joanne Miller, a political scientist at the University of Minnesota, explained the key concept to Salon. \u201cIn a nutshell, motivated reasoning is the notion that people like to maintain the attitudes they have, preserve the attitudes they have, the beliefs they have, protect their identities, especially if their attitudes are wrapped up in their identities,\u201d she said. Political knowledge comes into the picture naturally, as motivated reasoning encounters favorable or unfavorable information, and the role of trust is equally obvious: distrust is the mother\u2019s milk of all conspiracy theories. The idea of viewing conspiracy theories as a form of motivated reasoning isn\u2019t new (see Salon\u2019s 2013 interview with Stephen Lewandowsky, for example) but bringing it into focus in this particular framework\u2014foregrounding ideology, knowledge and trust\u2014is new, and it potentially opens up important new lines of inquiry.\n\nResearchers have identified a broad range of factors that can contribute to motivated reasoning; many of the politically relevant ones were integrated in the seminal 2003 paper \u201cPolitical Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition.\u201d I interviewed the paper\u2019s lead author, Jonathan Jost, in March 2015. But it\u2019s not just conservatives the concept applies to; it\u2019s completely general, as Miller went on to explain:\n\nWhen you are confronted with information that contradicts your attitudes, beliefs, impugns your identity, or groups that you identify with, you\u2014we\u2014all of us are motivated to reason through that information in a way that keeps our original attitudes intact. So, we\u2019ll counter argue, we\u2019ll criticize the data source, not pay attention to information that contradicts our pre-existing attitudes. At the very extreme we won\u2019t allow ourselves to be exposed, in the first place, to information that contradicts.\n\nConspiracy theories neatly fold into this, as the paper points out, \u201cendorsing ones that attribute nefarious intent to political opponents can serve an ideological worldview-confirming function by reinforcing one\u2019s political views through impugning opposing viewpoints.\u201d Indeed, the elaborate, even ornate nature of many conspiracy theories is the mirror opposite of their strategic simplicity in fending off a threatening other. As Miller summed up, \u201cIt\u2019s a way to feel better about your own worldview, in that it\u2019s the other side that\u2019s doing all this conspiratorial plotting against the greater good.\u201d In this context, adding more knowledge may only make the theories more elaborate, exactly the opposite of the hoped-for impact that more knowledge would have, and that democratic theorists have long assumed. Significantly, the paper found that knowledge did have this hoped-for effect overall, at least modestly, but not for conservatives when it came to conspiracies that make liberals look bad.\n\n\u201cWhen we look at all of our conspiracy theories together, don\u2019t pay attention to which ones impugn liberals, which ones impugn conservatives, and just create a whole index, it does turn out that people who know more about politics score lower on overall index of endorsement,\u201d Miller explained. \u201cSo the conventional wisdom, in a sense, is right.\u201d\n\nAs for the role of trust, \u201cThere\u2019s an intuitive hypothesis there,\u201d Miller\u2019s principle co-author, Kyle Saunders of Colorado State University, pointed out. \u201cThe less trusting citizens are, the more likely they are to engage in this motivated reasoning process, and therefore more likely to endorse conspiracy theories that impugn their rivals.\u201d There\u2019s a long history of survey data showing declining levels of trust in government and other institutions, and one set of data they drew on\u2014the 2012 American National Election Study (ANES) Time Series survey\u2014asked specifically about trust in government, but they also crafted their own online survey as well, using Amazon.com\u2019s Mechanical Turk (MTurk).\n\n\u201cWe wanted to get a broader measure of trust beyond whether you trust the federal government or whether you are not your trust in people,\u201d Saunders explained. \u201cAnd so in our own, in the MTurk measures we also have it [ask about] trust in the media as well as trust the police. Then we aggregated that from a measure of what we called generalized trust. Because I think it\u2019s tempting to say this is just about a declining trust in government; it\u2019s also about how connected, and how trusting citizens are with regard to the overall context of their daily lives and the other institutions that may or may not have power over them as well as other people who may have power over them.\u201d\n\nThe resulting generalized trust measure was ideologically balanced, and their finding was that \u201cThe more trusting you are, the less likely you are to engage in overall conspiracy endorsement, as well as conspiracy endorsement that impugns political rivals,\u201d Saunders said. A finding \u201cthat makes a lot of sense on its face.\u201d\n\nBut the role of information, and the interactions involved produced a more complicated picture. Before we delve into that, it\u2019s helpful to take note of the role of psychological factors.\n\n\u201cMuch of the research has been psychological, not disorders, but the predispositions that lead some people to be more likely to think in terms of conspiracies,\u201d Miller said. One such factor she cites is \u201ca need for control, but more specifically, a need to restore control. So if you think about the context in which conspiracies are thrown about, they tend to be when unexpected events happen, they\u2019re typically scary, they typically either involve loss of life or threats to life, and there\u2019s a lot of speculation about what the heck happened.\u201d In such situations,\u201dwe\u2019re all motivated in a sense to a search for meaning, for understanding of those events, because they\u2019re scary, and because we feel like we\u2019ve lost control, and if only we could understand the event we could gain better control, or feel like we have better control over our environment.\u201d\n\nThe fact that conspiracies can be wholly imaginary might be odd, but not inexplicable. Miller pointed to experiments showing that people experiencing loss of control are much more likely to see images in random dots on a computer screen. \u201cSo if you think of conspiracy theories as making connections between things that don\u2019t really belong together, conspiracy theories are one of the things that we go to in order to try to explain something that is unexplainable, because we need to restore control,\u201d she said.\n\nReducing anxiety is another motivation, she noted, but \u201cWhat\u2019s always odd about it to me, frankly, is that believing that someone plotted to do something awful actually reduces anxiety. Wouldn\u2019t you think that that would do the exact opposite? But it\u2019s something about the not knowing that\u2019s more anxiety producing than the knowing, or the believing that one has the answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s intriguing to me about this is this whole line of research is so full of these paradoxes,\u201d Saunders added. It\u2019s not a research field that\u2019s easily navigated. Which is why this paper is so promising. First, there\u2019s the main findings it established about roles of ideology, knowledge and trust, and confirming the soundness of viewing conspiracy theories through the lens of motivated reasoning. Second, there are significant wrinkles in the findings, such as the fact that the most intensely believed liberal conspiracy theory\u2014that the Bush administration lied about WMDs in Iraq\u2014isn\u2019t a conspiracy at all. And, third, it opens up promising lines for further research, most notably by establishing a model that can be applied in other countries, with a range of other conditions and conspiracy theories.\n\nThree Core Hypotheses\n\nThe paper\u2019s main findings are organized around a set of hypotheses it set out to test. The first was that \u201cconservatives will evidence greater motivated conspiracy endorsement than liberals,\u201d which is \u201cconsistent with the \u2018conspiracy theories are for ideologically motivated losers\u2019 argument.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe results bear that out,\u201d Miller said. In particular a \u201cconservative index\u201d of conspiracy theories making liberals look bad reflected higher levels of conservative endorsement than a similar \u201cliberal index\u201d of conspiracy theories that make conservatives look bad. This was true both for the ANES and the MTurk surveys.\u201cIf that didn\u2019t happen we would\u2019ve packed up and gone home,\u201d she added, since the rest of their theorizing depends on that foundation.\n\nThe \u201cconspiracy theory is for losers\u201d argument has historical support, Miller explained, documented in the 2014 book \u201cAmerican Conspiracy Theories\u201d by Joseph Uscinski and Joseph Parent, which looked at letters to the editor to the New York Times from 1890 to 2010, and found that the villains in conspiracy theories were more often on the left when a Democrat was president, and on the right when a Republicans was in the White House. But that analysis couldn\u2019t say anything about who the letter-writers were. Moreover, ideology and party ID are not the same thing, though Saunders points out, \u201cThey\u2019re very very highly correlated, and increasingly so for the last two or three decades.\u201d So it was reasonable to expect this hypothesis to hold, but it hadn\u2019t been tested\u2014until now.\n\n\u201cSo, confirmed,\u201d Miller said. \u201cConservatives endorse conspiracy theories that make liberals look bad to a greater extent than liberals endorse conspiracy theories that make conservatives look bad.\u201d But it\u2019s not a complete confirmation of the underlying \u201closer\u201d theory, Miller warned, since \u201cwe don\u2019t have a condition under which liberals are on the losing side, in terms of the presidency.\u201d\n\nThe second hypothesis was that \u201cthe more knowledgeable conservatives/liberals are, the more likely they will be to endorse ideologically consistent CTs,\u201d with a sub-hypothesis that conservatives would do it more, given the \u201cconspiracy theories are for ideologically motivated losers\u201d argument. But this time the main hypothesis was dis-confirmed: \u201cWe see it on the conservative side but we don\u2019t see it on the liberal side,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMore specifically, the paper explains:\n\nAmong MTurk respondents, knowledge is not related to endorsement of the liberal CTs for liberals, but negatively related to endorsement for conservatives. Among ANES respondents, knowledge is negatively related to endorsement of the liberal conspiracies for both liberals and conservatives, but the slopes are not significantly different from one another.\n\nSo\u2014at least under current conditions\u2014it\u2019s only conservatives who are more conspiracy-minded if they are more knowledgeable. Liberals act just as Enlightenment theory predicts\u2014the more knowledgeable they are, the freer of parochial viewpoints.\n\n\u201cFor the corollary\u2014that it would be high-knowledge conservatives that would do this more than high-knowledge liberals\u2014that is confirmed, because high-knowledge liberals don\u2019t do it at all,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting that. We were expecting [the effect in] both high-knowledge conservatives and high-knowledge liberals, just that the high-knowledge conservatives\u2019 [effect] would be bigger.\u201d\n\nThe third hypothesis was that \u201ctrust will \u2018turn off\u2019 the positive effect of knowledge on conspiracy beliefs,\u201d so that \u201cknowledge will have a positive effect on endorsement of ideologically consistent CTs among low-trust conservatives/liberals, but a negative effect on endorsement of ideologically consistent CTs among high-trust conservatives/liberals.\u201d A sub-hypothesis said that \u201cthe three-way interaction among ideology, knowledge, and trust will be larger for conservative CTs than for liberal CTs,\u201d in line with the \u201cideological loser\u201d argument.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The right has a conspiracy theory to explain everything they don't like.
