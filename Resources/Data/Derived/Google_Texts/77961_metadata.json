It removes the government from the decision at all. And since I\u2019m a doctor and since the College of Obstetrics and Gynecology has recommended it, I\u2019m okay with that. If the docs who care for women think that\u2019s the way it should be, then that\u2019s the way it should be,\u201d Cassidy said, using the former name of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \u201cWe should just remove the government from the decision, allow it to be sold over the counter.\u201d\n\nThe American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, that group of doctors who care for women, by the way, also advocates against laws that restrict access to abortion, such as the one Louisiana recently passed that requires physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. Cassidy\u2019s first public appearance after the primary election was to receive the endorsement of a national anti-abortion group.\n\nEveryone was all smiles after the interview, which was held at the Tiger TV studios in Hodges Hall on the LSU campus, recalls Kristen Althouse, of Mandeville, who at the time was the station\u2019s news director. (She now is station manager of Tiger TV.)\n\nThe next day, however, Cassidy\u2019s communications director, John Cummins, sent Bonacquisti a scathing email, blistering the young student for acting unprofessionally by asking a question not on the list approved by the campaign, Althouse said,\n\nCassidy, Cummins and other staffers on his campaign did not respond to three requests for comment Wednesday.\n\nTiger TV is a television channel that operates on campus and is designed as a learning workshop for LSU journalism students. The interview became more public when radio talk show host, Jim Engster, who is on a student media advisory committee, played portions of the interview on Tuesday.\n\nWhile access to contraception was one of the major issues in the 2012 presidential campaign, the subject has been little mentioned in Louisiana Senate race.\n\nIn Washington, the debate has broken along party lines with much of the controversy focusing on whether birth control should be easily available and, if so, the way to pay for it.\n\nWisconsin Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, whom Cassidy often cites as one of the congressmen he most admires, sponsored legislation called the \u201cSanctity of Human Life Act,\u201d which would define life as beginning at conception and would eliminate most common forms of birth control.\n\nBoth chambers of Congress, as well as the judiciary, also have been bickering over whether corporations of a certain size should be required to provide to their employees health care insurance that covered contraception.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Louisiana Politics", "description": "Republican U.S. Senate candidate Bill Cassidy favors over-the-counter sales of birth control.
