In the mid-’80s, Karen Loewen’s mother was around 50 when she went to get a mammogram.

“They told her that her whole breast was a lump,” Loewen, 47, said. “Both breasts.”

Her mother had calcification formations in mass. She quickly had a double mastectomy and her breast tissue was sent to the lab.

“They found absolutely no cancer,” Loewen said. “But they think it could have turned cancerous at any time. It was on the verge of changing.”

Mom survived, had breast reconstruction surgery and is approaching her 80s in good health.

This year, Loewen went in for her mammogram and the results came back.

“So here I am, 47 and I get my mammogram and the word ‘calcification’ hits,” she said. “I’m headed right down the same path as Mom.”

Loewen said she has a team of doctors who “are watching everything that happens in my tissue with a fine-tooth comb. The trick is catching it before it turns to cancer.”

The upbeat Loewen, who ran the Remember When antiques shop from 2002-2012 before landing a job in communications, said she would not have caught the calcification problem if not for the Affordable Care Act, aka Obamacare.

“I worked my (tail) off and I could not afford health insurance when I was a small business owner,” Loewen said. “People just don’t know how much it costs. Now, with Obamacare, I have health insurance for the first time in 15 years. That’s how this (calcification) got found.”

While Loewen keeps a close eye on her health, she gets plenty of exercise by using her bicycle as her primary mode of transportation around the city. She also volunteers with Meals On Wheels, where she uses her bike to travel 20 to 25 miles per day delivering food to elderly citizens in Frenchtown.

“We love to do it by bike,” she said.
