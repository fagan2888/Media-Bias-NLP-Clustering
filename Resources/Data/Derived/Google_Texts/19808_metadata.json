It is a state with people who do not like candidates who insult other people.\u201d\n\nIssues, he said, should be discussed, analyzed and resolved in order to move the country forward.\n\n\u201cThe issues are your lives,\u201d he said.\n\nA \u201ccorrupt campaign finance system is undermining American democracy,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocracy does not need billionaires buying elections.\u201d\n\nAmerica\u2019s economy is also \u201crigged,\u201d he said.\n\nHe specifically pointed out the Walton family, who he called the wealthiest family in America, while their employees \u201care on food stamps, Medicaid and subsidized housing.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho pays for that?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou do.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to get the Waltons off welfare and get them to pay you workers a living wage,\u201d he said to cheers.\n\n\u201cWe need to create an economy that works for all of us, not just the top 1 percent. If you work 40 to 60 hours a week you should not live in poverty,\u201d said Sanders.\n\nChange, said Sanders, doesn\u2019t come from the top down, but from the bottom up.\n\nHe referenced the labor movement, the Civil Rights movement and the women\u2019s suffrage movement as examples and called repeatedly for a revolution.\n\n\u201cChange comes about when people look around them and say, \u2018the status quo is not acceptable,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nSanders spoke in support of minority groups, starting each segment with the words, \u201cthis campaign is listening to \u2026\u201d then listing groups and the challenges they face one by one.\n\n\u201cThis campaign is listening to our brothers and sisters in the Latino community,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are tired of being exploited, tired of living in the shadows, tired of living in fear. We need comprehensive immigration reform and if Congress doesn\u2019t do the job, I will use the executive powers of the president to do all I can.\u201d\n\nHe said his campaign is listening to the African American community: \u201cHow can we spend trillions of dollars fighting a war in Iraq we never should have gotten into but somehow we don\u2019t have the money to rebuild the Flint water system?\u201d\n\nThey are listening to the Native American community, he said, who were lied to and cheated from the Europeans\u2019 first arrival. \u201cWe have a moral responsibility to address the many, many bad things we have done to the first Americans,\u201d he said, then honored them for teaching us respect for the environment and segued to the \u201cdevastating harm\u201d of climate change.\n\nOther groups he singled out for support were women, who deserve equal pay for equal work \u2013 and should get the support of men for that; and youth, who shouldn\u2019t be saddled with debt for getting the education they need in today\u2019s world, he said.\n\nHe spoke against a \u201cbroken criminal justice system,\u201d the war on drugs, and the fossil fuel industry. He said the Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t go far enough and pointed out several areas where the U.S. is behind other countries, such as not offering paid medical leave.\n\n\u201cNot for sale,\u201d read one sign hoisted by a supporter. \u201cUtah Hispanics are with Bernie,\u201d read another. Others read: \u201cWe are the 99 percent,\u201d \u201cGoths for Bernie,\u201d \u201cRepublicans 4 Bernie,\u201d and \u201cBernie has big hands.\u201d\n\nIt was mostly a young crowd that attended.\n\n\u201cHe has a clean record,\u201d said Grayson Coppock. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy you can believe in.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe seems like a genuine guy,\u201d said Rich Vosepka. \u201cHe wants to change the way we do things, how the electoral system and works and the economy is organized.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love the message of unity,\u201d said Brent Hamilton, who was there with his wife.\n\n\u201cHe seems to have common sense,\u201d said Nick Thomas. \u201cHe\u2019s not pulled by all the interests but is willing to speak for what he believes in rather than to please the general public. He\u2019s not afraid to say what will make people angry because he believes in it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2013 Raucous cheers greeted Bernie Sanders on his visit to West High on Monday.", "title": "Sanders calls for revolution, change", "og": {"image": "http://matchbin-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/public/sites/31/thumbs/6A6O_1_IMG_0309.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Sanders calls for revolution change - SALT LAKE CITY Raucous cheers greeted Bernie Sanders on his visit to West High on Monday.
