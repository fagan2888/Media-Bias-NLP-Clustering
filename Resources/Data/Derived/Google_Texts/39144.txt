An official at the University of California, San Francisco on Sunday took to Twitter to voice her opinions about those who oppose the president’s health care law. Stephanie Handler, who works in fundraising and alumni relations for the university, argued that those opposed to Obamacare ought to be denied access to care.

Shortly thereafter, Handler deleted both her Twitter and LinkedIn accounts. She told Twitchy that the posts to her account were intended to be humorous, not offensive, and that tweet in question has nothing to do with her work at UCSF. In addition, Handler said that she has alerted the university’s human resources department about her tweet.
