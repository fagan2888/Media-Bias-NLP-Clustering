The host of the show pointed out that premiums for health insurance were actually going up as high as 13 percent.

Christie predicted that the healthcare system would only get worse.

Christie said that Obama exhibited “extraordinary overreach” by pushing through his plan, and he suggested that Democrats would suffer politically.
