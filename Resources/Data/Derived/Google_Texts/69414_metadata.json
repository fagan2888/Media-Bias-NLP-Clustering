After the tour, President Hollande said at one point: \u201cAnd then President Jefferson purchased Louisiana from Napoleon, and today we\u2019re not demanding anything.\u201d (people present laughing)\n\nPresident Obama: \u201cIt was still a good deal, though.\u201d\n\nWhat was it that President Obama characterized as \u201ca good deal\u201d? From whose perspective was it \u201ca good deal\u201d? In 1803, the U.S. government purchased France\u2019s claim to \u201cthe colony and province\u201d called \u201cLouisiana,\u201d which was named after Louis XIV, King of France from 1643 to 1715. That vast area is 875,025 square miles in extent. That\u2019s 560 million acres of Indian nations\u2019 territories which had been claimed by France (and Spain) based on the Doctrine of Christian Discovery.\n\nFrance\u2019s claimed right of discovery was premised on a simple idea: When the exploring representatives of a Christian \u2018sovereign\u2019 managed to \u201cdiscover\u201d the mouth of a river, such as the Mississippi, the family of Christian sovereigns regarded that \u201cdiscovering sovereign\u201d as having had the right to claim \u201cdominion\u201d over all the watersheds that drained into that particular river, all the way to its source. What President Jefferson purchased from Napoleon was France\u2019s \u201cdiscovery\u201d claims to all the territories of Indian nations within that 875, 025 square miles.\n\nThe first French explorer to sail down the Mississippi River in 1682, from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico, was Rene-Robert de La Salle. In The Louisiana Purchase and Our Title West of the Rocky Mountains (U.S. Government Printing Office, 1900), Binger Hermann, then Commissioner of the U.S. Land Office, wrote: La Salle, standing with Tonty, Dautray and other companions on the banks of the most western channel of the Mississippi, about three Leagues from its mouth, on April 9, 1862, took possession of the country in the name of Louis XIV, and setting up a column, or, as Dr. Kohl insists, \u201ca cross with arms of the King,\u201d buried a plate, unfurled the flag of France, sung a Te Deum and naming the country \u201cLouisiana\u201d in a loud voice\u2026\n\nHermann said that La Salle had proclaimed the extent of Louisiana to be \u201cfrom the mouth of the great river St. Louis, on the eastern side, otherwise called Ohio, Alighin, Sipore, or Chiskagona,\u201d and this was done \u201cwith the consent of the Chaonanons, Chikachas, and other people dwelling therein, with whom we have made alliance, as also along the river Colbert, or Mississippi and rivers which discharge themselves therein\u2026\u201d[p. 12]\n\nThe explanation continues by referring to a place \u201cbeyond the Kious or Nadonessians, and this with their consent, and with the consent of the Motanties, Illinois, Mesigameus, Natches, Koroas, which are the most considerable nations dwelling therein, with whom we have also made alliance \u2026 as far as its mouth at the sea or Gulf of Mexico.\u201d The French invaders made their claim, said the account, \u201cupon the assurance which we have received from all these [Indian] nations that we are the first Europeans who have descended or ascended the said river Colbert [Mississippi].\u201d (Ibid.)\n\nIn an effort to make his actions appear legitimate, La Salle claimed that the original nations had consented to the French claiming their territories as a French possession. There is, of course, no way of verifying La Salle\u2019s account. Nor is there a way to verify what the French had said to the Indian nations, or what those nations understood, or didn\u2019t. I suppose we are expected to simply accept the idea that the French account is truthful. Undoubtedly, a tremendous amount of historical information, such as what the Indian nations truly thought of the invader\u2019s claims, was never adequately or accurately recorded by the French.\n\nWe do know that in the 1823 U.S. Supreme Court ruling Johnson v. M\u2019Intosh, handed down just two decades after the 1803 Louisiana Purchase Treaty, Chief Justice Marshall, who wrote the ruling, referred to the Indian nations in that vast area as \u201cin fact independent.\u201d This is evidence of the original free and independent nationhood or our nations and peoples that I am in the obsessive habit of pointing out.\n\nReturning to presidents Obama and Hollande, who could have guessed that history connected to the Doctrine of Christian Discovery would have come up in a couple of off-hand comments between the two heads of state? And because that history did get alluded to, it is a great time for American Indian leadership to seize the opportunity to challenge on the world stage the destruction that has been visited upon our nations and peoples as a result of the Doctrine of Christian Discovery.\n\nSteven Newcomb (Shawnee-Lenape) is co-founder and co-director of the Indigenous Law Institute, and author of Pagans in the Promised Land: Decoding the Doctrine of Christian Discovery (Fulcrum, 2008).
