Health insurance.\n\n\"I feel like it\u2019s a necessity,\" Thompson said. \"I feel like not being able to afford prescriptions that you're prescribed is a real shame.\"\n\nBut Thompson, 25, and her husband, 27, are young and healthy. So they are rolling the dice for now, until they can find an insurance plan that is affordable.\n\nThey are among the \"young invincibles\" \u2014 a term for the millions of young, healthy adults ages 18-34 who are the most desired demographic for any insurance company.\n\nYoung invincibles pay their premiums but use very little health care. They subsidize the cost of older, sicker Americans. They are essential for any well-functioning health insurance system.\n\nThe only problem?\n\nThey aren't signing up.\n\n* * *\n\nWhen it comes to a healthy individual market, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates \"young invincibles\" should make up at least 40 percent of the mix.\n\nAs of February, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, they make up 28 percent.\n\nDan Schuyler, a senior director with Leavitt Partners, said that figure isn\u2019t really surprising.\n\nImagine this: You\u2019re a 27-year-old single individual with no kids. You earn $40,000 a year, meaning you're not eligible for any subsidies.\n\nThe least expensive silver plan \u2014 the most popular kind \u2014 would cost $2,412 a year in premiums with a $2,000 deductible, according to Schuyler\u2019s calculations.\n\nThe least expensive catastrophic plan would cost $2,088 a year in premiums with a deductible of $6,580.\n\n\"For somebody who's only making $40,000 trying to pay college debt or saving for a house, it's a difficult proposition for them to consider buying insurance,\" Schuyler said. \"We just haven't done a satisfactory job of communicating to the young and healthy the reason why they need insurance.\"\n\nFor Melanie Skankey, a 27-year-old mother of two from Saratoga Springs, the family \u201cwould have to have some serious, serious medical problems to make it worth it.\u201d\n\nBetween her part-time teaching gig and her husband\u2019s GIS mapping job, the family pulls in about $4,000 a month.\n\nSkankey said she filled out an application on healthcare.gov and was told the family didn't qualify for any subsidies. The cheapest plan was $550 a month for a $10,000 deductible.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018This is silly,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nSkankey knows it\u2019s important to be insured. When her first daughter was born, she had to get braces and make extra doctor\u2019s visits for hip dysplasia. At the time, the Skankeys were insured and hit their $8,000 deductible with ease.\n\nIf something like that happens again, they\u2019ll be out of luck.\n\nBrenan and Marlena Thompson sit with their newborn, Virginia, and dog, Indie, near their home in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 22, 2016.

They\u2019re trying to save up enough money to buy a house. And they originally planned to have a third child. That's now on the back burner, and Skankey is considering going back to work for the health benefits.\n\n\"We both tried to study in fields that were high market potential so that when we graduated, we could stop eating ramen noodles every night,\" Skankey said. \"And we're still in the same place a year later.\n\n\"We might end up insuring the girls,\" she added. \"And then we're big, tough adults, I guess.\"\n\n* * *\n\nFor individuals and families, the consequences can be severe.\n\nAs an emergency physician at the University of Utah, Dr. Troy Madsen sees it all when it comes to young invincibles: Concussions. Broken bones. Torn ACLs.\n\nMadsen tries talking to patients about getting health insurance. But \"I don't know how successful (the discussions) are,\u201d he said.\n\n\"The challenge becomes if something happens, it really is a gamble because the bills from that sort of thing can be so big,\" Madsen said.\n\nWalk into the ER and you\u2019ll get a $500 bill before having a single procedure or tests done, he said. Get an X-ray or MRI and watch another few thousand dollars get tacked on. Go in for an operation? Be prepared for a $5,000 to $10,000 hit.\n\nMadsen says it\u2019s even more common to see young adults come in with illnesses that could have been avoided if they had gotten preventive care. That includes simple infections that turn into oozing abscesses, high blood sugar from untreated diabetes and asthma that flares up because they haven't been taking their medication.\n\nChase Harrison, a 26-year-old college graduate who just found employment as a blogger for a marketing company, decided he didn\u2019t want to take that risk.\n\nHarrison is trying to save enough money to move out of his mom\u2019s house, do a little bit of traveling, and have enough money left over for the weekends.\n\n\u201cNothing super exorbitant or anything,\" he said. \"A Saturday matinee is enough for me.\"\n\nHarrison worked with a broker and found a plan on the marketplace for $182 per month with a $6,800 deductible.\n\nThat seemed high, and he balked. For a minute, he wondered whether he could get away with not buying insurance.\n\n\"To me, that doesn't come across as being lazy and socially irresponsible,\" Harrison said. \"It's just that for a lot of people, you have to draw the line somewhere if you're on a limited budget. And I can see that as being one of those things that would easily go.\"\n\nHarrison ended up buying the plan because he didn\u2019t want to incur a fine. But he still wonders if it was worth it.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been sick enough to need to go to the doctor for five years,\u201d he said. \"I don't have any reason to need insurance other than getting struck by a bolt of lightning.\u201d\n\nPart of the issue is misinformation, said Jason Stevenson of the Utah Health Policy Project.\n\nPeople like Harrison appear to be stuck in what\u2019s called the coverage gap. Because Utah didn\u2019t expand Medicaid, Harrison doesn\u2019t qualify for federal aid or for subsidies.\n\nBut families like the Thompsons and Skankeys should qualify for several hundred dollars per month in subsidies, Stevenson said.\n\nUsing the window-shopping tool at healthcare.gov/see-plans, Stevenson pulls up a silver plan for a family of four that would cost $322 a month with a deductible of $2,300.\n\nBrenan and Marlena Thompson take a walk with their newborn, Virginia, and dog, Indie, near their home in Salt Lake City on Friday, April 22, 2016.

She said she filled out an application on the website and received an email shortly thereafter saying that she doesn\u2019t qualify for any subsidies.\n\nFor the Thompsons, Stevenson found a SelectHealth plan for $52 a month with no deductible.\n\nBut Thompson didn\u2019t spend much time on the site because it was so difficult to navigate, she said. Nor did she know that Take Care Utah, a program run by the Utah Health Policy Project, has navigators on hand for free assistance.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think that I would be much more able to navigate that site,\u201d said Thompson, who used to work \u2014 ironically enough \u2014 at an insurance company.\n\n\u201cNot only are there tons of different websites claiming to be the website you need to be on, (but also) to walk through it, it\u2019s pretty confusing,\u201d she added.\n\nThompson and her husband have decided to apply for Medicaid instead, though it's not certain whether they\u2019re eligible.\n\nShe\u2019s worried about her husband, who has stopped taking his ADHD medication because it\u2019s too expensive. Thompson said she can tell he is growing more distracted and less effective.\n\n\"I feel like we're doing well enough that it shouldn't be federal aid at this point,\" Thompson said. \"But the pharmaceutical companies are so out of control that at this point, yes, young people who are average young couples need federal aid.\"\n\nNavigators and insurers need to do a better job at helping young adults, Stevenson acknowledged. But he said that negative perception about the Affordable Care Act has also turned many young adults against the marketplace.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest barrier we have with young invincibles \u2014 the fact that they\u2019re getting inaccurate information or not getting an accurate representation of what kind of insurance they could get,\u201d Stevenson said.\n\nSchuyler says health officials and insurers need to make a better pitch to young adults \u2014 and fast.\n\nOn Tuesday, one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers announced it would pull out of Obamacare exchanges in 2017, citing concerns about their profitability.\n\nSchuyler called UnitedHealth Group\u2019s exit a \u201cmajor concern.\u201d\n\nIf more healthy people don\u2019t sign up soon, insurers will continue to lose money on patients, he said. That means carriers will continue to raise prices to make up for the loss. And that will make health insurance even less appealing to young adults, starting a vicious cycle that analysts call the \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t fix this problem, all the carriers are going to be in jeopardy,\u201d Schuyler said.\n\nHe said the administration should consider allowing more flexibility and innovation by loosening the essential benefits requirements so insurers can tailor plans for young adults.\n\nInsurance companies and navigators also need to do more to get the message out to youths, he said.\n\nLastly, lawmakers have to start addressing the issue in a nonpartisan way, according to Schuyler.\n\n\"The premise of Obamacare makes sense, but you've got to address the shortcomings and problems,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe conversation,\u201d he added, \u201cneeds to start now.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nTake Care Utah\n\nThis network of 90 navigators and enrollment specialists offers statewide enrollment help for health insurance.
