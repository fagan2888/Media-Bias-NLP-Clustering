White House chief of staff Denis McDonough and deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes informed an official from the Armenian National Congress of America of the decision in a meeting at the White House on Tuesday. [\u2026] \"This is a betrayal of the truth, a betrayal of trust, a disgraceful national surrender to a foreign gag order being imposed by the government of Turkey,\" said Aram Hamparian, executive director of the Armenian National Committee of America, who attended the White House meeting.\n\nTurkey devotes a huge chunk of its diplomatic efforts to discourage the world from using the G-word, out of concern that doing so besmirches the memory of the country's founding hero, Kemal Ataturk. Senior Turkish officials have gone ballistic against the Pope and the European Parliament for their recent calls for Istanbul to come clean about the century-old massacre. Meanwhile, too many Europeans in particular have taken this historical criticism to absurd and illiberal ends by making denial of the genocide a crime (one which free-speech hero George Clooney's international-lawyer wife Amal Clooney is only too happy to help enforce).\n\nWe should not be surprised that a country that can't even produce a clean yes-or-no \"state sponsor of terror\" list without subjecting it to politics and diplomatic wheedling should find itself, year after year, letting its basic language be held hostage by its own anxious reliance on a strategic NATO ally to project power in the broader Middle East. But it should serve as a cautionary tale most of all to humanitarian interventionists such Ambassador to the United Nations Samanth Power\u2014the diplomat formerly know as \"genocide chick,\" whose plaintive 2008 promise to the Armenian-American community remains one of the great emetics in U.S. politics.\n\nI've written a lot about this issue over the years; if you're interested, start from last year's post and work your way backward through the links.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Official language remains hostage to U.S.-Turkey relations", "title": "Obama Breaks Promise to Call the Armenian Genocide a \u2018Genocide\u2019 for 7th Year in a Row", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/04/21/obama-breaks-promise-to-call-the-armenia", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14296519422962.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "On the 100th anniversary of the beginning of Turkey\u2019s genocide against an estimated 1.5 million Armenians, a handful of na\u00efve and/or indefatigable Armenian-American activists had been hoping that somehow, despite a convincing track record to the contrary, President Barack Obama would use this April 24 National Day of Remembrance of Man's Inhumanity to Man (in which U.S. presidents are tasked", "title": "Obama Breaks Promise to Call the Armenian Genocide a \u2018Genocide\u2019 for 7th Year in a Row", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14296519422962.jpg", "creator": "@mattwelch", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "World", "published_time": "2015-04-21T21:40:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/matt-welch"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "White House chief of staff Denis McDonough and deputy national security advisor Ben Rhodes informed an official from the Armenian National Congress of America of the decision in a meeting at the White House on Tuesday.\nYeah, no:President Barack Obama will not use the word \"genocide\" to describe the massacre of up to 1.5 million Armenians in his annual statement commemorating the historic atrocity later this month.\nI've written a lot about this issue over the years; if you're interested, start from last year's post and work your way backward through the links.\nSenior Turkish officials have gone ballistic against the Pope and the European Parliament for their recent calls for Istanbul to come clean about the century-old massacre.\n[\u2026] \"This is a betrayal of the truth, a betrayal of trust, a disgraceful national surrender to a foreign gag order being imposed by the government of Turkey,\" said Aram Hamparian, executive director of the Armenian National Committee of America, who attended the White House meeting."}
