Everyone at Pygmy Boats is covered by the company-sponsored health care plan.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act exempts companies with fewer than 50 workers from having to provide medical benefits, but small manufacturers are thinking twice before pointing employees to the now-open state or federal exchanges.

Moreover, many of the smallest manufacturers that have never been able to afford health care are, for the first time, finding coverage for employees through PPACA’s Small Business Health Options Program, or SHOP, even though that program has yet to be made widely available. Many of these small manufacturers are qualifying for SHOP’s tax credits to help get them started.
