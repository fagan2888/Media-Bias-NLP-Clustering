More than scheme, though, the key difference will be philosophical -- attacking, aggressive.\n\nRodriguez calls it a \"fresh start\" for everyone, and one of those fresh starts we can report is the move of senior Sani Fuimaono (6-1, 294) from nose guard to 3-technique tackle, a more glamorous position on the defensive line.\n\nHe'll line up between the offensive guard and the tackle, or outside the tackle depending on how what the offense is running.\n\n\"What I am trying to get back to is being comfortable with the open room I have off the edge during pass rushes, just setting the edge and getting to the quarterback as quickly as I can,\" Fuimaono said.\n\n\"It's been a while since I've rushed off the edge, but it's slowly coming. I got a couple of good runs in there these last couple of days.\"\n\nRushing the passer?\n\nWell, that is different.\n\nAs a nose guard in a three-man front, Fuimaono's task was to eat up multiple blocks in order to give the linebackers open alleys to make tackles and accept the glory.\n\nTypically, the 3-technique tackle is supposed to be a playmaker in the opposing team's backfield.\n\n\"I'm excited to not have to worry about trying to take on all the double teams, triple teams down the middle,\" Fuimaono said with a smile. \"I'm excited that Coach trustd me to move outside and let me play there.\"\n\nSNAPPING COUNTS\n\nArizona has to replace two starting offensive linemen, including center Cayman Bundage, who stepped into the position because of injury as a senior after starting at guard for most of the previous three seasons.\n\nHis toughness and tenacity were unquestioned, but errant shotgun snaps in critical times were a source of frustration.\n\nAs many as seven offensive linemen are snapping during practice, but the top three are senior Zach Hemmila, sophomore Levi Walton and redshirt freshman Nathan Eldridge, according to offensive line coach Jim Michalczik.\n\n\"The biggest thing about snapping is consistency,\" Michalczik said.\n\n\"Last year, unfortunately, it was some inconsistent moments that cost us. The guys understand the importance. It's something they have to work on on their own because we can't work with them with the ball when we're not in practice.\"\n\nElsewhere on the line, Arizona has to find a new right tackle to replace Lene Maiava. One candidate could be freshman Keenan Walker, who delayed his enrollment until this January while he rehabbed an ACL injury.\n\nHe's a full-go in practice, Rodriguez said.\n\n\"He has all the stuff that you want,\" Rodriguez said of Walker, a four-star recruit from Scottsdale Chaparral High School. \"He's a big, athletic guy. He has a nastiness and a physicalness to him. He's going to have some growing pains this spring and this summer, but we like what we've seen so far.\"\n\nArizona OL coach Jim Michalczik on freshman lineman Keenan Walker after today\u2019s practice pic.twitter.com/FbaSZcUxSf \u2014 Matt Moreno (@MattGOAZCATS) February 14, 2016\n\nTAKING A BREAK\n\nAfter holding practice on Friday and Saturday, the Wildcats will now take a week off.\n\nWhy?\n\nRodriguez will be at a Nike-sponsored coaches conference in Hawaii.\n\n\"Believe it or not, I'm telling the truth here: It's probably as good a week of professional development as you can have, because there are 20 or 25 other coaches there who are at the top of the game and all we do is lay around and talk ball most of the time,\" Rodriguez said.\n\n\"We do talk a lot of football. Not all day, but just enough to make it look like a business deal.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Wildcats will lift weights Monday and Wednesday and meet with their position coaches on Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nSOAKING IN THE SUN\n\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh made news recently when he announced he would take his team to Florida for a week of spring practice.\n\nRodriguez said he could see this idea catch on for cold-weather schools.\n\n\"If that's a recruiting tool for them for one week, it's a recruiting took for us year round,\" he said.\n\n\"That's what we've been saying. If you want to come to where the weather is nice, you don't have to wait until spring break. We have spring break every week.\"\n\nNOTABLE\n\n--Sophomore Jamarde Cobb, who spent last season at fullback, has returned to linebacker. He could end up with spot-duty on offense. \"He will probably still run some fullback for us,\" Rodriguez said. \"I think last year, he only ran two plays, so if he can just remember those same two plays, he can maybe play a little both ways.\"\n\n--Sophomore Darrell Cloy Jr., a little-used tight end last season, asked to move to the defensive line, Rodriguez said. He is 6-2, 259. \"With our needs on the D-line, I think it was a good move,\" Rodriguez said. Cloy is 6-2, 259.\n\n--Previously: RB Orlando Bradford into the spotlight\n\nArizona\u2019s new coaches are doing a lot more showing instead of telling.
