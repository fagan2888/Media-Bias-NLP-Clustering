Australian Parliament Approves Medical Marijuana Growing

The Australian Parliament took the first step in medical cannabis legalization recently when they approved the growing of marijuana for medical and research purposes.

“This is an historic day for Australia and the many advocates who have fought long and hard to challenge the stigma around medicinal cannabis products so genuine patients are no longer treated as criminals,” said Minister for Health Sussan Ley in a statement.

There is still a way to go before registered patients in Australia will be able to get marijuana prescribed by their doctors; for now the new law is supposed to allow for a legal supply to be used for scientific research and clinical trials.

The measure itself amends the country’s Narcotic Drugs Act, which only allowed for cannabis to come from other countries for research.

Countries around the world, in the face of states in the U.S. liberalizing their marijuana laws, are deciding that the days of cannabis prohibition are numbered; including Mexico and Canada.

A new day is dawning, one that could lead to liberty for cannabis users worldwide.
