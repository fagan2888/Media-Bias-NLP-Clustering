The two behavioral scientists wrote in their 2008 book \"Nudge\" that government policies can be crafted in a way that \"nudges\" citizens to behave in a certain way.\n\nSunstein proposed one idea Tuesday which would automatically enroll utility customers in green energy plans unless they opt out, citing a similar experiment conducted in Germany which led to a tenfold increase in people choosing clean energy.\n\nPresident Obama's health care law also appears to contain plenty of language and experimentation designed to \"nudge\" citizens' perception and actions. For example, perhaps the most controversial re-framing was the way the Obama administration labeled the individual mandate as a penalty rather than a \"tax,\" as Republicans claimed it was.\n\nAnother Obamacare nudge involved the government sending \"reminder letters to individuals who had started to apply for health insurance,\" which \"led to 13 percent more completed applications,\" according to a White House fact sheet released Tuesday. To help identify which presentation was more effective, the Department of Health and Human Services \"sent one of eight behaviorally designed letter variants to each of more than 700,000 individuals who had already begun the health insurance enrollment process but had not yet completed an application. Those sent the most effective version of the letter were 13.2 percent more likely to enroll in health insurance than those sent no letter, with enrollment rates of 4.56 and 4.03 percent, respectively. \"\n\n\"The desired choices almost always advance the goals of the federal government, though they are often couched as ways to cut overall program spending,\" according to The Daily Caller.\n\nIn the U.K.'s similar program, one experiment found that sending a letter to late taxpayers which read \"9 out of 10 people in Britain pay their taxes on time\" resulted in a 15 percent increase in timely payment compliance.\n\nTo kick-start the program, federal agencies are encouraged to recruit behavioral scientists and develop relationships with researchers in order to better implement \"empirical findings from the behavioral sciences.\"\n\nResearchers from MIT, Harvard and the Brookings Institute, among others, have signed on to the program, according to the White House.", "article_metadata": {"Description": "The idea is to use behavioral psychology to push citizens to make better decisions by simplifying forms, sending reminders and re-framing their choices by tinkering with the content, format, timing and medium by which information is conveyed.", "Copyright": "2016 Headlines & Global News", "Author": "Headlines & Global News", "og": {"site_name": "Headlines & Global News", "description": "The idea is to use behavioral psychology to push citizens to make better decisions by simplifying forms, sending reminders and re-framing their choices by tinkering with the content, format, timing and medium by which information is conveyed.", "title": "Obama Orders Agencies To Use Americans' Behavioral Data To Further Government Programs", "url": "http://www.hngn.com/articles/130290/20150916/obama-orders-agencies-use-americans-behavioral-data-further-government-programs.htm", "image": "http://images.hngn.com/data/images/full/134819/obama.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "hngn.com", "description": "The idea is to use behavioral psychology to push citizens to make better decisions by simplifying forms, sending reminders and re-framing their choices by tinkering with the content, format, timing and medium by which information is conveyed.", "creator": "@HNGNcom", "url": "http://www.hngn.com/articles/130290/20150916/obama-orders-agencies-use-americans-behavioral-data-further-government-programs.htm", "image": "http://images.hngn.com/data/images/full/134819/obama.jpg", "title": "Obama Orders Agencies To Use Americans' Behavioral Data To Further Government Programs", "site": "@HNGNcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "syndication-source": "http://www.hngn.com/articles/130290/20150916/obama-orders-agencies-use-americans-behavioral-data-further-government-programs.htm", "robots": "index, follow", "Googlebot-News": "index, follow", "Keywords": "Headlines & Global News", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-16"}, "Subject": "hngn.com", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0;", "news_keywords": "obama, orders, agencies, use, americans, behavioral, data, further, government, programs"}, "article_summary": "To kick-start the program, federal agencies are encouraged to recruit behavioral scientists and develop relationships with researchers in order to better implement \"empirical findings from the behavioral sciences.\"\n(Photo : Getty Images)President Obama's latest executive order, announced Tuesday, authorizes and encourages government agencies to begin conducting behavioral psychology experiments on U.S. citizens in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of government programs.\nObama Orders Agencies To Use Americans' Behavioral Data To Further Government ProgramsThe idea is to use behavioral psychology to push citizens to make better decisions by simplifying forms, sending reminders and re-framing their choices by tinkering with the content, format, timing and medium by which information is conveyed.\nResearchers from MIT, Harvard and the Brookings Institute, among others, have signed on to the program, according to the White House.\nPresident Obama's health care law also appears to contain plenty of language and experimentation designed to \"nudge\" citizens' perception and actions."}
