It\u2019ll happen, as it already has among health insurers and Big Pharma, because it has to \u2014 the better to navigate a health care landscape being reshaped fundamentally by technology and the controversial Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cYes, I believe\u201d consolidation \u201cis coming, and given that it\u2019s coming we will not turn a blind eye to it,\u201d Fox said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re not in active discussions with anybody. We\u2019ve got a full plate.\n\n\u201cOur priority is to make sure we have a successful merger. Anybody who\u2019s in my job with an IQ over 80 has to look at who\u2019s in the neighborhood. And I assume others are doing it, too. The next step is where the billion-dollar players are merging with each other. I can\u2019t predict the timing on that.\u201d\n\nThe three-way merger of Beaumont, Oakwood and Botsford closed 13 months ago, creating Michigan\u2019s largest hospital system with annual revenue of $4.3 billion and 35,000 employees. It melded three organizations into one with eight hospitals in two counties and 168 sites, including doctors\u2019 offices, outpatient surgery centers, imaging and therapy centers and nursing homes.\n\nFox arrived last March from Emory Medical Center in Atlanta, an outsider free of the bias and baggage that an insider can bring to running a combined company seeking to create a new corporate culture. The transition, much of it put in motion by his predecessor, resulted in just 11 departures in senior management \u2014 some through retirement, a \u201cmuch smaller fallout than I expected,\u201d Fox says.\n\nGone is the Beaumont burgundy and the Oakwood green in the system\u2019s livery, replaced by blue-and-white branding that proved to be trusted and reassuring to focus groups. All of the system\u2019s employees are on a single Beaumont email system; financial management and accounting are combined.\n\nThe effort to launch common electronic medical records, accessible by all Beaumont hospitals and properly accredited doctors, is nearly complete. Botsford Hospital, the smallest of the three founding entities, is the last to adopt the new system and should be complete by month\u2019s end.\n\n\u201cOverall, we\u2019re doing well,\u201d Fox says, adding that the combination of three health systems is coalescing around the common metrics of quality, safety and other standards for care. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a little better than budget. Volumes are up.\u201d\n\nUncertainty is, too. Rolling implementation of Affordable Care Act continues to reshape the building blocks of American health care. Merger mania is not done for hospitals, or pharmaceutical companies or insurers, giving bigger players in the industry\u2019s co-dependent segments more power to move pricing up and some benefits down.\n\nHe predicts mergers and acquisitions among health insurers will produce three mega players \u2014 Aetna, Anthem and United Healthcare \u2014 theoretically reducing competition in ways the Affordable Care Act\u2019s architects did not intend. That doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t happening.\n\nThe Michigan market is not immune, either. A push toward developing a statewide presence, and more scale, could drive more mega-mergers here, where the top nine hospital systems deliver 80 percent of the health care bought by employers for their employees.\n\nThose are trends hospital systems cannot control so much as manage as they look for opportunities. Closer to home, Fox envisions the suburbs-based Beaumont working with competitors to look for ways to become more closely connected to Detroit and its needs.\n\nShould Beaumont be exploring seriously the prospect of opening clinics in the city? Could it work with competitors and perhaps the county mental health authorities to devise a regional mental health care system to address needs \u201cso patients don\u2019t get stuck in the middle,\u201d as he put it?\n\nNot bad ideas for a dynamic health-care sector around here whose leaders have a bias for dictating events instead of the other way around. They\u2019re building and investing, leading as much in redevelopment as they are managing seismic change.\n\nHenry Ford Health System, a would-be partner with Beaumont until their proposed merger fizzled over control, is pressing ahead with a $110 million cancer center, part of its $500 million project in the neighborhood near its flagship hospital. Detroit Medical Center has a new heart hospital and is beginning construction on a new Children\u2019s Hospital of Michigan.\n\nAll good, that, evidence that change remains the biggest constant for major health care providers around here, John Fox\u2019s Beaumont included.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1LfDFHg", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Hospital giant focusing on building one company, but will keep eye on \u2018who\u2019s in the neighborhood.\u2019", "og": {"site_name": "Detroit News", "description": "Hospital giant focusing on building one company, but will keep eye on \u2018who\u2019s in the neighborhood.\u2019", "title": "Howes: Beaumont CEO sees more change in MI health care", "url": "http://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/columnists/daniel-howes/2015/10/06/howes-beaumont-ceo-predicts-change-bigger-mergers-michigan-healthcare/73434370/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/detroitnews.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Hospital giant focusing on building one company, but will keep eye on \u2018who\u2019s in the neighborhood.\u2019", "title": "Daniel Howes: Beaumont CEO predicts more change, bigger mergers in MI healthcare", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8bffdadca4bb5195488d9c97aeebcafb792828ca/c=0-16-1002-1018&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/06/DetroitNews/B99311610Z.1_20151006075833_000_GUQJRE7S.1-0.jpg", "creator": "@detroitnews", "site": "@detroitnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=904391631", "fb": {"app_id": 175422022549521}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "Daniel Howes, Detroit News, Beaumont Health, John Fox, mergers, consolidation"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaa86\"", "article_summary": "Not necessarily now, and not necessarily for the combination of Royal Oak-based Beaumont, Oakwood Health System and Botsford that he leads.\nAll good, that, evidence that change remains the biggest constant for major health care providers around here, John Fox\u2019s Beaumont included.\nJohn Fox (Photo: Beaumont Health System)Southfield \u2014 The view from John Fox\u2019s office window is all freeway, but the CEO of the combined Beaumont Health can see more consolidation coming in the hospital business.\nRolling implementation of Affordable Care Act continues to reshape the building blocks of American health care.\nThose are trends hospital systems cannot control so much as manage as they look for opportunities."}
