Yes you can. Grassley says no to doing the work assigned him by the constitution. He gets paid a hell of a lot of money for that. He has a big staff, a huge office plus offices around the state that we pay for. Since his last election, despite the good pay and incredibly excellent benefits, Chuck Grassley has refused to do his job.

The past couple of years have been almost landmark in how to dis your boss (us) and stay employed. Grassley signs a letter that interferes in negotiations with Iran. Is it treason? You decide, but it is certainly a kick in the face for our country.

Then as chair of the Judiciary Committee, Grassley has pretty much stopped appointing judges to the federal bench. This is causing a crisis in our judicial system. Why? Just to obstruct the President, that is all. Thwarting the constitution bust to obstruct the president.

Grassley also jumped on the big train to tear down Hillary Clinton. Apparently Ms. Clinton hasn’t given Grassley the proper respect so for a while he held up all appointments to the State Department. Grassley must not have realized Ms. Clinton was no longer Secretary of State. This little snit on Grassley’s part almost caused major problems for the US at the time of the terrorist attacks in Paris. Leaders in other countries tried to deal with our embassies at that time only to find many way understaffed to deal with a crisis.

Now we come to the death of a Supreme Court Justice. The founders anticipated that men would become feeble and die, so they made provisions for replacement of these men. How to do this is in the constitution. Grassley as a senator refuses to do his job.

When an elected public official refuses to do their job, we have an obligation to remove that official. It is too bad that there isn’t some provision for withholding pay and benefits (including those free flights home) until said official decides it is in his interest to do his job. Makes one also wonder why he needs a staff.

Ultimately we do have the power, if we decide to use it. We should be sick and tired of Grassley’s games by now. At this point he is laughing at us and our inability to remove him from office. We are the ones who must stand up and tell him that he represents us and not his party.

Grassley has represented his party and not represented Iowa for decades. Now that his party is only the party of not just NO but HELL NO (to quote John Boehner) it is time to tell Chuck “you’re FIRED!” His refusal to represent us while only representing his party is doing us and the country harm. The game is over, Chuck.
