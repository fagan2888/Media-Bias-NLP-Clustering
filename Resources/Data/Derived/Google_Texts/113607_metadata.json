So he goes with a little bit of a reckless abandon,\u201d coach Mike Krzyzewski said after the 15th-ranked Blue Devils beat Boston College 81-64 in the Atlantic Coast Conference opener for both teams.\n\n\u201cHe usually is either knocked to the floor or he falls to the floor because of those Herculean plays that he makes,\u201d Krzyzewski said.\n\nAllen does the same thing in practice, but his coach doesn\u2019t dare tell him to take it easy.\n\n\u201cI think you have a greater chance of getting hurt by tempering your natural instincts,\u201d Krzyzewski said.\n\nAllen had 17 points, nine rebounds and five assists for the Blue Devils (12-2), and Brandon Ingram finished with 25 points and nine rebounds. Duke fell behind by six points early in its first true road game of the season before scoring 20 of the next 25 points.\n\n\u201cI think we had a little bit of nervousness at the beginning,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut first time playing on someone\u2019s home court, first ACC game, that\u2019s expected.\u201d\n\nLuke Kennard added 17 points, and Matt Jones had 16 to help Duke beat BC for the 10th consecutive time.\n\nEli Carter scored 19 points for Boston College (7-7, 0-1), and Jerome Robinson had 15 points and seven rebounds.\n\nBC led 12-6 with 7 minutes gone in the game before Derryck Thornton made a jumper on an assist from Allen and then Jones made a 3-pointer to cut the deficit to one point. Allen then stole the ball from Robinson and took it in for a dunk to give Duke its first lead of the game.\n\nAllen was slow to get up after landing hard among the media sitting courtside.\n\nIt was 18-17 Duke before the Blue Devils made eight consecutive free throws. Duke scored the last five points of the first half to take a 37-24 lead.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No. 15 Duke beats Boston College 81-64 in ACC opener", "title": "No. 15 Duke beats Boston College 81-64 in ACC opener", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "No. 15 Duke beats Boston College 81-64 in ACC opener", "title": "No. 15 Duke beats Boston College 81-64 in ACC opener", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/01/03/no_15_duke_beats_boston_college_81_64_in_acc_opener/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/duke-boston-college-basketball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "No. 15 Duke beats Boston College 81-64 in ACC opener", "title": "No. 15 Duke beats Boston College 81-64 in ACC opener", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/01/duke-boston-college-basketball.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Jimmy Golen", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Eli Carter scored 19 points for Boston College (7-7, 0-1), and Jerome Robinson had 15 points and seven rebounds.\nSo he goes with a little bit of a reckless abandon,\u201d coach Mike Krzyzewski said after the 15th-ranked Blue Devils beat Boston College 81-64 in the Atlantic Coast Conference opener for both teams.\nDuke scored the last five points of the first half to take a 37-24 lead.\nIt was 18-17 Duke before the Blue Devils made eight consecutive free throws.\nAllen had 17 points, nine rebounds and five assists for the Blue Devils (12-2), and Brandon Ingram finished with 25 points and nine rebounds."}
