TOMS RIVER â€“ What began as a car crash on Route 9 Tuesday night ended with two township men in handcuffs.

Nicholas Corsair was driving a 2007 Infinity G35 at 9:50 p.m. Tuesday when it left the roadway and slammed into a utility pole, according to a news release from Officer Ralph Stocco.

Neither he, nor the passenger, Robert Latronico, was injured, Stocco said. But the car and utility pole were damaged. Police had to set up detours on Route 9 so crews from Jersey Central Power & Light could repair the pole.

When police arrived at the scene of the crash, they determined 19-year-old Corsair was under the influence of alcohol, Stocco said. He was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated.

Police found Latronico, 23, with heroin, Stocco said. He was charged with heroin possession and had five outstanding warrants from Toms River and Brick, amounting to $1,500.
