Nixon. The 37th President demonstrated his perilous lack of self-awareness in exquisitely succinct fashion when he told Sir David Frost that there are moments when it is necessary, even laudable, for the executive to break the law.\n\n\u201cWell, when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal,\u201d Nixon told his interlocutor. For decades, the ghastly hubris displayed in this comment appalled both the conscientious left and the right.\n\nAs long as it comes from the mouth of an ideological ally, the paradoxical nature of this statement would probably be lost on today\u2019s liberals. The ends, it seems, increasingly justify the means.\n\nTake, for example, the analysis of Brian Beutler, of the gutted New Republic, on how Hill Democrats are reacting to the hideously named \u201cCromnibus\u201d (a funding package designed to keep the government open while setting up the fight in 2015 over de-funding the president\u2019s unilateral extension of legal status to millions of illegal immigrants).\n\nThat $1.1 trillion measure has ignited outrage on both the right and the left. Populist conservatives are appalled at the spending in that budget deal, for which the only concession Republicans exacted from Democrats were the loosening of restrictions on Wall Street contained within Dodd-Frank.\n\n\u201cYou can tell how complete Boehner\u2019s capitulation is by the fact that Democrats are willingly going along with the farce that this is a Republican principles bill while admitting that their votes are necessary to save the bill,\u201d wrote RedState\u2019s Leon Wolf. \u201cInstead they are sending out a couple safe Dems to mount token public opposition for their base while (not very subtly) smiling that for the next year the Republicans will not be able to provoke budget fights over anything including a meaningful fight over Obama\u2019s wildly unpopular executive amnesty.\u201d\n\nAccording to Beutler, the Democratic opposition to this bill is not \u201ctoken\u201d at all. In fact, it is indicative of how the party will comport itself in the minority.\n\nNeeding votes is a matter of mathematical precision. Deciding what\u2019s responsible and what isn\u2019t is a matter of subjective judgment. A subtext of her comment is that [House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is] the House Democrat best positioned to make that determination. Three days later, she\u2019s taking her own analysis out of the abstract, and testing critics, who have urged her to relinquish power. This afternoon, her office has issued at least five urgent press releases, threatening implicitly to pull Democratic support for legislation to fund the government unless Republicans strip a provision from that bill that would allow FDIC-backed financial institutions to trade a wider range of derivatives, after the Dodd-Frank financial reform law relegated many such trades to uninsured subsidiaries. Translated: if John Boehner and Republicans insist on keeping this rider in the bill, they will shut down the government.\n\n\u201cShut down the government?\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound like Republicans are inclined to pursue this course at all. In fact, it sounds like Democrats are the party most eager for that outcome.\n\n\u201cHere, in microcosm, is the Democratic old guard making the case that they\u2019re actually best prepared to lead the party in the minority, by showing that Democrats know how to exact a toll when Republicans use their power to advance unpopular aspects of their agenda quietly,\u201d Beutler concludes.\n\nAnd you thought that a government shutdown was the ultimate demonstration of a party\u2019s intransigence and unwillingness to serve as a responsible partner in governance. That\u2019s so 2013.\n\nBeutler doesn\u2019t sound nearly as opposed to this course of action as he was when Republicans embarked on this disastrous course. Perhaps he is so self-assured in his apparent support for Democratic shutdown brinkmanship because he continues to believe, as he wrote in Salon in 2013, that Republicans will \u201calways (rightly) be blamed for shutdowns.\u201d\n\n\u201cVoters might not be attuned to the minutiae of policy, but I think they know pretty well which party cares more about government employees and keeping the government in working order,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou can\u2019t just camouflage a decades long raison d\u2019\u00eatre with a handful of messaging votes.\u201d\n\nIn short, Democratic partisans will always extend Democrats the benefit of the doubt.\n\nBeutler\u2019s prognosis above does, however, contrast with his analysis just prior to the shutdown that also appeared in Salon.\n\n\u201c[A shutdown is] perhaps the only way to persuade monomaniacal House Republicans that there\u2019s a difference between negotiation and extortion,\u201d Beutler asserted, \u201cthat if their extreme demands touch off a visible crisis like a government shutdown, everyone will know who\u2019s at fault. That\u2019d be great for Democrats for obvious reasons.\u201d\n\nHeads, I win. Tails, you lose.\n\nA government shutdown led by Democrats might be the unlikeliest of outcomes ahead of the next Congress. Contrary to Beutler\u2019s analysis, the party that shuts down the government is the party that is most likely to be blamed for that suboptimal state of affairs. The wounded Democratic Party can hardly afford to alienate more Americans.\n\nIt is worth noting that for some partisans, however, a government shutdown becomes a bold and attractive course of action when it is their side that is doing the obstruction.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Shutdown for thee.", "title": "When Democrats do it, it\u2019s not a government shutdown", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2014/12/10/when-democrats-do-it-its-not-a-government-shutdown/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-11T01:41:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-11T03:06:51+00:00"}, "keywords": "brian beutler, cromnibus, government shutdown, Nancy Pelosi,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0c8a\"", "article_summary": "A government shutdown led by Democrats might be the unlikeliest of outcomes ahead of the next Congress.\nThe wounded Democratic Party can hardly afford to alienate more Americans.\nBeutler\u2019s prognosis above does, however, contrast with his analysis just prior to the shutdown that also appeared in Salon.\nIn fact, it sounds like Democrats are the party most eager for that outcome.\nBeutler doesn\u2019t sound nearly as opposed to this course of action as he was when Republicans embarked on this disastrous course."}
