Stirling Ackroyd \u2026\n\nOne of the reasons Mr. Fulton said he was attracted to the 701-square-foot penthouse was \"the amazing view overlooking Queen Square. Being on the seventh floor gave us a panoramic view through windows on the north, west and south sides of the building.\" Stirling Ackroyd \u2026\n\n\"The penthouse is light and airy with a fresh, smart, cool feel,\" said Mr. Fulton. \"With so much natural light, it gives the feeling of space whilst living in central London.\" Stirling Ackroyd \u2026\n\nLocated at the back of the apartment, the en-suite master bedroom includes fitted wardrobes.
