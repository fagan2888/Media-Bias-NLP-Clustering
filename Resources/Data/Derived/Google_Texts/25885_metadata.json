The pads were popping, the sweat was flying and neither team\u2019s offense seemed in sync.\n\nGranite Bay\u2019s senior middle linebacker Ryan MacIntosh helped his team scratch the scoreboard first as he picked off a Jesuit pass at their own five-yard line and returned it for a touchdown.\n\nBut MacIntosh wasn\u2019t the only defensive player making a splash.\n\nSafety Sam Cusano helped the Grizzlies clinch the win with a timely 33-yard interception return for a touchdown to put Granite Bay up, 21-0, with just 6:26 left in regulation.\n\n\u201cThey outscored our offense,\u201d head coach Jeff Evans said of his defense.\n\nGranite Bay\u2019s stout defensive unit did not surrender a single point to Jesuit until the game\u2019s final four minutes. For that, Evans praised his 34 seniors on the team for their \u201coutstanding\u201d leadership during Granite Bay\u2019s perpetration for and execution in the home opener.\n\n\u201cThat was one of the things that made the (coaching) transition easier for me,\u201d admitted the first-year head coach. \u201cKnowing that this was going to be the group of seniors that I was walking in with, on top of the coaching staff. There\u2019s some years where we just don\u2019t feel or look like \u2018a Granite Bay\u2019 football team. This team looks like \u2018a Granite Bay\u2019 football team, and those seniors made that happen.\u201d\n\nThe Grizzlies, who historically favor the running game, made an effort to air it out early in the game. Despite two consecutive holding penalties, both which negated substantial offensive gains, the home team never gave up on the passing game.\n\n\u201cIt was more mental mistakes by us than Jesuit,\u201d said junior running back Isaiah Lewis, who\u2019s 14-yard reception in the fourth quarter produced Granite Bay\u2019s only offensive touchdown of the evening.\n\nLewis received especially high praise from coach Evans after the win.\n\n\u201cEvery so often, we get a special athlete,\u201d Evans explained. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few of them in the past, like Sammie Stroughter and Devon Wylie and Miles Burris, guys like that. He\u2019s that type of guy \u2014 just an extremely supreme athlete. He looked like a man among boys tonight, even against Division I guys that were on (Jesuit).\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to do some big things for us.\u201d\n\nGranite Bay will now take its 1-0 record on the road as the Grizzlies travel to Elk Grove next week to square off with 2014 Capitol Valley Conference champion Consumnes Oaks. Kickoff for that game is scheduled for 7:15.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "geo.position": "37.09024;-95.712891", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 169449507770}, "ICBM": "37.09024, -95.712891", "keywords": "news, the press tribune,local news, Roseville News, Granite Bay news, national news, state news, breaking news, crime log, sports, national sports, local sports, classifieds, Roseville photos, Roseville health, Roseville fitness, Roseville dinning guide,ski Roseville report, Roseville sports score, living, Roseville arts, Roseville entertainment", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Local Roseville news.
