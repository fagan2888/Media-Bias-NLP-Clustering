How do you see your research work helping them accomplish that?\n\nThe first thing I will tell growers is to not be afraid of change. The market is more demanding nowadays. Consumers have a high knowledge about produce and so they are more exigent in the quality and the sustainability of the products they pay for. We need to bring that.\n\nWe need to produce higher-quality fruits in a more sustainable way, at the same time we\u2019re reducing the labor costs. The use of machines for pruning, thinning, and harvest is changing the orchard. From new rootstocks to new planting systems, mechanization will play an important role here. New technologies will help in getting higher yields with uniformly high quality. For instance, growers will have on their smartphone the exact amount of water or nutrition they need to apply to every single tree in the orchard.\n\nAt Cornell we\u2019re working to bring all this knowledge and tools to the farmers. New Geneva rootstocks and precision crop management practices will help growers to know the best choice right from the beginning, from before planting the orchard to the full mature harvest.\n\nHow long have you been doing research in support of fruit growers?\n\nI started working in research in 2009 in the Institute of Research and Technology, Food and Agriculture (IRTA, located in Catalonia), where I did my Ph.D. after finishing a postgraduate at UC Davis. Since January 2015, I have worked at Cornell University.\n\nWhat made you want to get into ag research as a profession?\n\nI was born in a family of farmers, I have been related to and enjoyed fruit tree growing since my childhood, when I started working in apple and pear orchards on my father\u2019s farm. I earned a good knowledge in agriculture through a B.S. in Agricultural Engineering specializing in Horticulture at the University of Lleida (Catalonia). After that, I carried out an M.S. in Agronomy and Crop Science simultaneously at University of Lleida and University of Bologna (Italy).\n\nMore from GenNext Growers", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Growing Produce", "description": "As the next generation of growers become leaders and decision makers in their own operations, they won\u2019t have to make those decisions on their own.
