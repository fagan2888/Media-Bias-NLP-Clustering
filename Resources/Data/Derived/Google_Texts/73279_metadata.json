Abraham Lincoln was a big fan of William Shakespeare, and Macbeth was Lincoln\u2019s favorite play. The main link, however, between the two pieces was not thematic but linguistic: Both effectively used monosyllabic language that was rich in imagery.\n\nSome of the most memorable lines from Macbeth are entirely monosyllabic:\n\n\u201cOut, damned spot! Out, I say!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s done is done.\u201d\n\n\u201cFair is foul, and foul is fair.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf chance will have me king, why chance may crown me...\u201d\n\n\u201cI go, and it is done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe queen, my lord, is dead.\u201d\n\nThe play\u2019s most famous speech in Act V is also heavily laced with monosyllables: \u201cLife is but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot full of sound and fury, signifying nothing!\u201d (39 words, 31 monosyllables.)\n\nIn a similar manner, monosyllabic language dominates Lincoln\u2019s \u201cGettysburg Address,\u201d which is beautifully structured around the simple metaphor of birth-death-rebirth. Of the 272 words in the address, 210 are monosyllables\u2014almost 75%; additionally, I count another 42 words as having two syllables, leaving just 20 words in the address as having more than two syllables, \u201cdedicate\u201d or \u201cdedicated\u201d being the most common (6x). The point is that the language was simple, powerful , memorable, and evocative. A similar analysis of Lincoln\u2019s\u201d Second Inaugural Address\u201d\u2014believed by some to be even better than the \u201cGettysburg Address\u201d\u2014yields similar results: 703 words, 505 monosyllables (72%).\n\nLike Shakespeare, unrhymed iambic pentameter (blank verse) is Lincoln\u2019s preferred method of writing and predominates in his address. Consider this line: \u201cThe world will little note, nor long remember, what we say\u2026\u201d It consists of 14 syllables in perfect iambic pentameter\u2014an unaccented syllable followed by an accented syllable. Just like the most famous speech from Macbeth, the address is full of alliteration\u2014the repetition of initial consonant sounds. \u201cFour\u2026forth; \u201cnew nation\u201d; \u201clittle note\u2026nor long remember\u2026\u201d; \u201cpeople\u2026perish,\u201d etc. I used to tell my students that the \u201cGettysburg Address\u201d is the closest that prose comes to being poetry.\n\nIn September of 1940, another devotee of simple yet powerful language made one of the most memorable speeches of the 20th century. His name was Winston Churchill, and here is what he had to say about the pending Nazi invasion of England:\n\n\u201cWe shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s 42 memorable words, 85% monosyllabic.\n\nIn a conversation once with Hartford\u2019s Harriet Beecher Stowe, Lincoln told her how important it was for him as an elected representative of the people to speak and to write in simple, comprehensible language: \u201cThe people will understand it,\u201d he insisted. In the Federalist Papers his notable presidential predecessor, James Madison, expressed a similar preoccupation with simple, clear language from elected representatives :\n\n\u201cIt will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood.\u201d (39 words; 30 monosyllables.)\n\nContrast the simple, direct, and clear language of Madison, Lincoln, and Churchill with the following direct quotation from a recent piece of federal legislation:\n\n\u201cThe Secretary shall adopt operating rules under this subsection, by regulation in accordance with subparagraph (C), following consideration of the operating rules developed by the non-profit entity described in paragraph (2) and the recommendation submitted by the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics under paragraph (3)(E) and having ensured consultation with providers.\u201d\n\nGot that? I didn\u2019t think so. That was a direct quotation from Section 1104-- ironically entitled \u201cAdministrative Simplification\u201d-- in the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as \u201cObamacare.\u201d\n\nSenator Thomas Carper, a Democrat and Delaware\u2019s senior senator, said this about the Affordable Care Act: \u201cI don\u2019t expect to actually read the legislative language because reading the legislative language is among the more confusing things I\u2019ve read in my life.\u201d (Senator Carper voted for it anyway.)\n\nThe occasion of the sesquicentennial of the \u201cGettysburg Address\u201d offers us an opportunity to remember the power of simple and clear language. Madison, Churchill, and Lincoln: All are noteworthy and memorable for the beautiful simplicity and clarity of their writings and speeches. All three men used simple and powerful language to connect with their people. Lincoln strongly felt that elected leaders should speak and write in a way that is readily comprehensible to the people who elected them, a goal that he undeniably achieved in the \u201cGettysburg Address.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Durham-Middlefield, CT Patch", "description": "November 19, 2013, marks the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address, a work demonstrating the power of simple, powerful, comprehensible language, an aspect of writing Lincoln felt to be vital to a democracy.", "title": "The Memorable Monosyllables of Lincoln\u2019s \u201cGettysburg Address\u201d", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.patch.com/users/106260/2013/11/T800x600/f80b9c1b03b0707e109cfcbc2f251fbf.jpg", "url": "http://patch.com/connecticut/durham/the-memorable-monosyllables-of-lincolns-gettysburg-address", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": 116541048368485, "section": "Community Corner", "published_time": "2013-11-19T05:32:51-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-19T06:19:07-05:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521361477908471}, "description": "Durham-Middlefield, CT - November 19, 2013, marks the 150th anniversary of the Gettysburg Address, a work demonstrating the power of simple, powerful, comprehensible language, an aspect of writing Lincoln felt to be vital to a democracy.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde885\"", "article_summary": "In a similar manner, monosyllabic language dominates Lincoln\u2019s \u201cGettysburg Address,\u201d which is beautifully structured around the simple metaphor of birth-death-rebirth.\nI used to teach Lincoln\u2019s \u201cGettysburg Address\u201d as a companion piece to Shakespeare\u2019s Macbeth.\nI used to tell my students that the \u201cGettysburg Address\u201d is the closest that prose comes to being poetry.\nThe occasion of the sesquicentennial of the \u201cGettysburg Address\u201d offers us an opportunity to remember the power of simple and clear language.\nA similar analysis of Lincoln\u2019s\u201d Second Inaugural Address\u201d\u2014believed by some to be even better than the \u201cGettysburg Address\u201d\u2014yields similar results: 703 words, 505 monosyllables (72%)."}
