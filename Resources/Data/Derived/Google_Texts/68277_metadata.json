Yet I\u2019m here to make one. Because, as more than one observer has noted, the parallels between the rise of Adolf Hitler and that of Donald Trump have become too neon to ignore.\n\nLike Hitler, Trump has watched approvingly as his followers use violence to silence hecklers, dissenters and protesters. Like Hitler, Trump offers few real plans or strategies for confronting the nation\u2019s challenges, giving voters instead the assurance that he, by force of personality alone, will defeat them.\n\nLike Hitler, Trump has presented the electorate a scapegoat for its fears and vulnerabilities. Hitler gave his people the Jews. Trump has given his the Muslims.\n\nLike Hitler, Trump proposes to register, surveil and restrict the scapegoat populace. Nor, like Hitler, is he overly concerned with the niceties of civil or human rights. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to do certain things that were frankly unthinkable a year ago,\u201d he has said.\n\nIt is in that context that Rose Hamid stood up last week in South Carolina.\n\nHamid, a 56-year-old Muslim flight attendant attending a Trump rally in Rock Hill, came to her feet and stood silently as Trump equated refugees from Syria with Islamic State terrorists. She was wearing a hijab and a blue T-shirt that said, \u201cSalam, I come in peace.\u201d Several others stood in solidarity.\n\nThis passive protest was enough of a provocation that the audience began chanting their leader\u2019s name like a mantra \u2013 \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d \u2013 and a police officer escorted Hamid out. She told CNN that while some Trump followers apologized to her, others pelted her with abuse.\n\n\u201cGet out!\u201d one person shouted.\n\n\u201cYou have a bomb?\u201d another cried.\n\nIt all brings home something that has become glaringly obvious: While many of us have lamented Trump\u2019s improbable rise to political prominence, the real problem is not him and never was.\n\nRather, the problem is that thing deep down in some of us that responds to him, that small, primeval thing so filled with uncertainty, fear and fury that it will suspend both logic and compassion to worship a man whose very name has become a symbol of all that is hateful and hostile to American ideals.\n\nNo, Trump is not Hitler. Hitler was a singular figure who committed a singular crime. Nor do I believe Trump will even be president. But his dominance of the Republican field is instructive just the same, offering vivid evidence of the depth of alienation on that side of the political spectrum. The rest of us ignore or underestimate that alienation at our own peril. The threat it poses to our hopes for a just and inclusive America is real and grave and should be treated as such.\n\nTo read of how fascism stole over Germany is to repeatedly ask yourself how an enlightened nation could have fallen for such transparent garbage. Well, the answer is unfolding before us in real time and it ought to horrify good people into taking a stand.\n\nOne woman already did.\n\nLeonard Pitts is a columnist for The Miami Herald.
