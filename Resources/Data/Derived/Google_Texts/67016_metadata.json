According to the Bristol Post:\n\nLily-Grace Hooper, who is seven, suffered a stroke when she was just four days old, which left her virtually blind. But her school, Hambrook Primary School, has now told the youngster she can no longer use her walking cane, because it could trip up teachers and other pupils at the school. A risk assessment by Gary Learmonth from Sensory Support Service \u2013 done on behalf of the school \u2013 said the cane caused a high risk to other people around Lily-Grace, and that she should instead have full adult support \u201c100 per cent\u201d at all times.\n\nIn other words, at the risk assessor\u2019s behest, the school is ready to create a dependent and incapacitated child out of a bold and bubbly girl who was getting around just fine. In fact, she\u2019d come up with the cane idea herself, after tripping over some wrapping paper rolls at Christmas, and then realizing she could use them to tap her way around.\n\nHer mother is, not surprisingly, beside herself:\n\n\u201cWhat about the health and safety of my girl? I like school, they are a good school, but this really is very poor advice.\u201d\n\nPerhaps. But to a certain bureaucratic mind, it\u2019s not poor advice at all. It\u2019s sensible! Jo Dent, the head of the school, insists, \u201cThe pupil has not been banned from bringing in their cane, we have simply asked them to not use it around school as a temporary measure, until we have the chance to meet with the parent and discuss the situation.\u201d\n\nWhich is sort of like saying the gasping patient can have the oxygen tank in his room, he just can\u2019t use it until after some more discussions.\n\nFortunately, an exec from Britain\u2019s Health and Safety brigade has weighed in and said there is nothing that prevents a child from using a \u201cwalking stick\u201d in school.\n\nNothing except a mindset that can\u2019t see the forest for the tripping hazards. Quoth Ms. Dent:\n\n\u201cWe have to consider all our pupils, so it\u2019s important that we have an opportunity to discuss the situation before we make any decisions.\u201d\n\nNow there\u2019s a lady who likes to discuss. Maybe once those discussions ensue she will see the light: Independence is the goal. Not blind adherence to bureaucracy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Falling down dumb", "title": "Blind Girl Denied Use of Cane in School Because It's a Tripping Hazard", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/11/19/blind-girl-denied-use-of-cane-in-school", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14479415916664.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14479415916664.jpg", "description": "Falling down dumb", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Blind Girl Denied Use of Cane in School Because It's a Tripping Hazard"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Culture", "published_time": "2015-11-19T14:07:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/lenore-skenazy"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "A blind girl in Britain has been told she cannot use her cane at school because it presents a tripping hazard.\nBut her school, Hambrook Primary School, has now told the youngster she can no longer use her walking cane, because it could trip up teachers and other pupils at the school.\nA tripping hazard, that is, to the people who can see her\u2014and her cane.\nI like school, they are a good school, but this really is very poor advice.\u201dPerhaps.\nAccording to the Bristol Post:Lily-Grace Hooper, who is seven, suffered a stroke when she was just four days old, which left her virtually blind."}
