Adoption rates in Michigan have gone up, and Republicans in the state responded to the achievement by making it harder for some Michigan residents to adopt. On Thursday, Gov. Rick Snyder signed into law three bills passed by the Republican legislature that allow agencies to refuse adoption to same-sex couples based on religious beliefs.

Now that all the brouhaha over gay weddings and pizza parlors over in Indiana has died down, Snyder has become the latest governor to sign discrimination into law, despite his promises to veto any so-called religious freedom bills back in April. According to the state Department of Human Services, religious adoption agencies are budgeted to receive nearly $10 million in state and federal monies this fiscal year.

Snyder took less than 18 hours to sign the trio of bills after the Republican-controlled state Senate unexpectedly sent the legislation to the governor Wednesday evening.
