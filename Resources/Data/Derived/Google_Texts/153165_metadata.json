This week of action aims to expand outreach to the farthest corners of the community.\"\n\n#AAPI groups hailed SCOTUS\u2019 decision last year to again uphold the Affordable Care Act https://t.co/I5tnAqIKut #SOTU pic.twitter.com/Xuf5jEWZDA \u2014 NBC Asian America (@NBCAsianAmerica) January 13, 2016\n\nThe week of action kicks off Tuesday with a call between Surgeon General Vivek Murthy and stakeholders in the Asian-American community.
