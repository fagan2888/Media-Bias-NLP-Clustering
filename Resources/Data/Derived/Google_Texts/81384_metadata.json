Most of the insurance companies and medical groups participate in both markets, she noted.\n\n\n\n\u201cCovered California would like data specific to its enrollees, but it doesn\u2019t exist yet, because the program is too new,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThey are hoping to point people in our direction to look at the report card and use that as a proxy for how the health plans and medical groups do for their enrollees.\u201d\n\n\n\nHMOs get an overall patient satisfaction score, based on a survey, and are also graded on specific details of their interaction with patients, including access to care and ability to get answers to questions.\n\n\n\nThe medical groups are also rated based on how well they communicate with patients and whether they promote good health, coordinate care effectively, offer timely appointments and have helpful office staff.\n\n\n\nPatient-generated scores are more limited for PPOs.\n\n\n\nThere are some incongruities in the data, Abbott conceded. For example, even health plans with top patient ratings fare much worse if you drill down into the more detailed questions.\n\n\n\nThough Kaiser got four stars (excellent) in its overall patient rating, it got only two (fair) when patients were asked how easy it was to get appointments or answers to their questions. Health Net had a three-star (good) overall rating from patients, but was classified as poor on those two questions.\n\n\n\nAbbott noted that fewer patients answer the detailed questions than the general one, so the data sample is smaller. And the answers may be more negative, she speculated, because patients who are \u201cvery disappointed and annoyed\u201c are more likely to respond to those questions than people who either have not used their health plans or \u201cgot excellent service.\u201d\n\n\n\nAbbott conceded that \u201ca relatively small number of people presently\u201d take the time to consult the report card. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to try really hard to fix that.\u201d\n\n\n\nYoung Invincibles, a group that advocates on behalf of people ages 18-34, plans to work with the Office of the Patient Advocate and Covered California to spread the word about the report card, said Linda Leu, the group\u2019s policy director.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs young people, most of us are buying health insurance for the first time, and the more information we can have access to, the better,\u201d Leu said.\n\n\n\nAnthony Wright, executive director of Health Access, a Sacramento-based consumer advocacy group, noted that under the Affordable Care Act people who were previously unable to get insurance \u2013 or to switch health plans \u2013 because of a pre-existing medical condition now have no such restrictions.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo this is a tool for people with a new ability to shop around during open enrollment,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nContact the writer: 714-796-2440 or bwolfson@ocregister.com", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "US-CA", "content_section": "business", "description": "Business: Kaiser tops health report card in Orange County, state | health, care, patient, medical, report, patients, california, stars, people, groups", "geo.position": "33.745573;-117.867834", "author": "BERNARD WOLFSON", "og": {"site_name": "The Orange County Register", "description": "Kaiser Permanente got top marks among HMOs and medical groups in Orange County and across California, according to the most recent edition of a state-sponsored health care report card released Wednesday.
