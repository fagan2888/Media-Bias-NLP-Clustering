The website, www.healthcare.gov, comes up on screen but will not allow many to log in and get insurance.\n\n\u201cI just want to get signed up. That\u2019s all I want to do,\u201d said Goodenough.\n\nInstead, you get this message on the screen.\n\n\u201c\u2018We have a lot of visitors on the site right now. Please stay on this page,'\u201d Goodenough read off the screen.\n\nBut if you do stay, the message often changes to this: \u201cThe system is down at the moment.\u201d\n\nJoanne Peters, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement: \u201cExperts are working around the clock and were able to expand system capacity somewhat overnight, cutting by one-third the volume of people waiting to apply. Work on the site continues today.\u201d\n\nTo say that the website has been overwhelmed is putting it mildly.\n\nIn the first 48 hours, more than seven million Americans have tried to log on to get health insurance.\n\nGovernment officials say, try the old-fashioned way \u2014 make a phone call to the 800-number.\n\nThat\u2019s what Erin Ninehouser from the Pennsylvania Health Access Network did.\n\n\u201cI actually just called them a few minutes ago and it took me less than one minute to connect with a live person,\u201d said Ninehouser.\n\nGoodenough tried to do the same, and after a few recorded prompts, she got a human being, too.\n\nBut if you prefer online, just wait a few weeks.\n\n\u201cThere is absolutely no need to sign up immediately. As long as you do it by Dec. 15, coverage starts Jan. 1,\u201d noted Ninehouser.\n\nRELATED LINKS:\n\nMore Local News\n\nMore Reports by Jon Delano", "article_metadata": {"description": "Unable to get health insurance because of a pre-existing condition, Julie Goodenough of Crafton was excited to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, but so far it's been frustrating.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2013/10/03/too-many-customers-overwhelm-obamacare-website/", "image": {"width": 420, "secure_url": "https://cbspittsburgh.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/health_error.jpg?w=420", "identifier": "https://cbspittsburgh.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/health_error.jpg?w=420", "height": 316}, "type": "article", "description": "Unable to get health insurance because of a pre-existing condition, Julie Goodenough of Crafton was excited to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, but so far it's been frustrating.", "title": "Too Many Customers Overwhelm Obamacare Website"}, "twitter": {"site": "/CBSPittsburgh", "image": "https://cbspittsburgh.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/health_error.jpg?w=420", "description": "Unable to get health insurance because of a pre-existing condition, Julie Goodenough of Crafton was excited to sign up for coverage under the Affordable Care Act, but so far it's been frustrating.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Too Many Customers Overwhelm Obamacare Website"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and the Best of Pittsburgh", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Pittsburgh", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPittsburgh", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSPittsburgh"}, "keywords": "affordable care act, health, local, news, politics, syndicated local, affordable health care act, health care, health insurance, healthcare, healthcare.gov, jon delano, obamacare, online, u.s. department of health and human services, website", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/97501d9d4ef7a23e7663780b0a506821?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable health care act, health care, health insurance, healthcare, healthcare.gov, jon delano, obamacare, online, u.s. department of health and human services, website"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0347\"", "article_summary": "Goodenough tried to do the same, and after a few recorded prompts, she got a human being, too.\nGovernment officials say, try the old-fashioned way \u2014 make a phone call to the 800-number.\nThe website, www.healthcare.gov, comes up on screen but will not allow many to log in and get insurance.\nWork on the site continues today.\u201dTo say that the website has been overwhelmed is putting it mildly.\n\u201cSo they said, try again in a few days, and still can\u2019t get in there.\u201dShe\u2019s hardly alone."}
