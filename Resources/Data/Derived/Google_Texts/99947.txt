Some authors write “whodunits” or tomes about history.

Joseph Gabra wrote a book about Obamacare and income taxes.

The Camarillo certified public accountant wrote the 90-page “Affordable Care ‘Tax.’” It details the tax implications of federal tax reform, including the 1095-A form many people have received from Covered California and the penalties facing many of the people who remain uninsured.

“I find many people have misunderstandings, even people in the industry,” said Gabra, who’s already planning his next book on the Affordable Care Act, focusing on tax implications for small and large businesses.

The book is available at www.amazon.com.
