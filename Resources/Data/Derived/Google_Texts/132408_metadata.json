She says that for most people, those conditions are uncomfortable, but that those with some health conditions \u2014 including high blood pressure and diabetes, or those taking certain medications \u2014 can be much more sensitive.\n\nFor those prisoners, exposure to heat can lead to long-term health consequences or death. And the number of inmates prone to this sensitivity has been growing; the elderly prison population has been increasing for years, and people with mental illness make up a disproportionate percentage of inmates in the U.S.\n\nPrisoners' rights lawyers and others have been arguing for decades about what constitutes a reasonable temperature. One lawyer, Mercedes Montagnes, filed a lawsuit last year demanding that the heat index \u2014 a calculation of heat and humidity \u2014 on Louisiana's death row not go above 88 degrees. A judge agreed and ordered air conditioning installed, but that's on hold as the state appeals the decision.\n\nMontagnes knows that plenty of people outside prison don't have air conditioning. But prisoners have a right to reasonable temperatures and can't escape the heat the way the unincarcerated can, she says.\n\n\"Those individuals have the ability to go to a freezer, to get cold water, to go to a mall, to go to a movie theater ... to take action in order to mitigate the effect of the heat on them,\" she says.\n\nThe argument for air conditioning prisons has found allies in some unlikely places.

Because of that litigation, state officials wouldn't talk on the record, but the state corrections department said in a statement that it is trying to mitigate the high temperatures. Those efforts include purchasing more than $50,000 in industrial-grade cooling fans to test at seven facilities.\n\nFormer Texas warden Keith Price, now a professor of criminology and sociology at West Texas A&M University, said that it's important to accommodate heat-sensitive prisoners, but that inmates also need to acknowledge that prison is not a five-star hotel.\n\n\"You know, they don't get to go get a cheeseburger whenever they want to, either,\" Price said. \"So, I mean, you know there's a certain amount of things that you give up when you become incarcerated.\"\n\n\n\nCopyright 2014 NPR.

When he was found, the temperature in his cell was at least 100 degrees - the exact cause of his death is still under investigation. But Alisa Roth reports the case is renewing attention to a long-standing problem in jails and prisons.\n\nALISA ROTH, BYLINE: Dr. Susi Vassallo grew up in Texas. So she\u2019s not afraid of heat. But she still remembers her reaction when she stood in an un-air-conditioned prison cell one summer.\n\nSUSI VASSALLO: When you closed the doors. they had just little dots in them, which provided any ventilation from the outside. Even after five minutes, it was absolutely stifling, it was inconceivable to live there 23 hours a day, day after day.\n\nROTH: Vassallo is a physician and professor at NYU\u2019s medical school. And an expert on heat-related illnesses. Who\u2019s often called to testify in lawsuits about temperatures in jails and prisons. She says for most people those conditions are uncomfortable. But for some people, they\u2019re actually dangerous because health conditions or medications they take make them more sensitive.\n\nVASSALLO: Specific conditions, such as mental illness or high blood pressure or diabetes, we think of those conditions and the medications used to treat as rendering those people more, more susceptible to heat.\n\nROTH: Prisoners\u2019 rights lawyers - and others - have been arguing, literally for decades about what constitutes a reasonable temperature. But the issue has taken on more urgency, because the populations of both elderly and mentally ill prisoners have been growing.\n\nOne of those lawyers is Mercedes Montagnes. She says prisoners have a right to certain things.\n\nMERCEDES MONTAGNES: Food, access to drinking water, a roof over their heads, medical care.\n\nROTH: And, she argues, reasonable temperatures. She filed a lawsuit last year demanding that the heat index equal a calculation of heat and humidity - on Louisiana\u2019s death row not go above 88 degrees.\n\nShe knows plenty of people outside prison don\u2019t have air conditioning. But, unlike prisoners, they have the freedom to do something about it:\n\nMONTAGNES: Of course those individuals have the ability to go to a freezer, to get cold water, to go to a mall, to go to a movie theater\n\nROTH: And the argument for air conditioning prisons has found allies in some unlikely places. Last year, a group of prison guards from Texas joined a lawsuit against the state\u2019s Department of Corrections.\n\nLANCE LOWRY: The officers are required to enter housing areas and work in housing areas where the inmates are housed and are exposed to this constant bombardment of heat.\n\nROTH: Lance Lowry is a former prison guard in Texas. Who now works with the guards\u2019 union. He says guards have many of the same health conditions as prisoners - obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure. Even mental illness.\n\nLOWRY: Officers frequently suffer from heat cramps and a lot of heat illnesses.\n\nROTH: He says prisoners are harder to manage in the heat. There are more fights and more psychiatric emergencies. Texas is among several states facing lawsuits over temperatures in its correctional facilities. And because of the ongoing litigation it wouldn't talk on the record. But in a statement, the corrections department said it tries to mitigate the high temperatures. Keith Price is a professor of criminology and sociology at West Texas A and M. And a former Texas warden. He says prison is not a five-star hotel, and prisoners need to acknowledge that.\n\nKEITH PRICE: You know, they don\u2019t get to go get a cheeseburger whenever they want to, either. So I mean you know there\u2019s a certain amount of things that you give up when you become incarcerated.\n\nROTH: On the other hand, he says, it\u2019s important to accommodate prisoners who are heat-sensitive. The challenge is it is hard to know exactly how many prisoners are living in what we considered overheated conditions. But for example lawyers say that if the more than 150,000 prisons beds in Texas, only around 550 are climate controlled. For NPR News, I'm Alisa Roth in New York.
