NEW YORK (MainStreet) - The Obama administration's fight for the middle class, trumpeted in last week's State of the Union address also includes an all-out war on 529 College Saving plans and people who are saving for their kids' education.

Savers currently put after-tax dollars into a 529 account which are run mainly by states. It grows tax free and money is withdrawn tax free when its time for school. Obama wants to end tax-free withdrawals from these accounts, beginning with new contributions, supposedly to eliminate a tax break for the wealth. His intentions were announced in the State of the Union Fact Sheet, a little-known document released on January 17, three days before his speech to Congress.

Observers from the Left and Right immediately cried foul-charging that Obama's plan would penalize those that should be helped-and were already trying to help themselves.

According to the Washington, D.C.-based College Savings Foundation, almost 10% of accounts are held by families with an income below $50,000 per year. Over 70% are owned by families with incomes below $150,000.

A survey produced by SavingForCollege.com finds that 59% of those who open a 529 account did it mainly to get federal tax benefits.

"The President claims that 529 savings plans only help the wealthy, but we couldn't disagree more," said Kathryn Flynn, content director at SavingForCollege.com. "Many hard working families are currently taking advantage of these benefits to help ensure a solid future for their children. In fact, we found that 73% of SavingforCollege.com visitors that were planning to open a 529 account in the next 12 months had household incomes of less than $150,000."
