Scott Walker's cabinet. He continued:\n\n\"She once met a young boy from a very poor family. And every day at school, he would get a free lunch from a government program. He told Eloise, he didn't want a free lunch. He wanted his own lunch, one in a brown paper bag, just like the other kids. He wanted one, he said, because he knew a kid who had a brown paper bag had someone who cared for him. This is what the left does not understand.\"\n\nBut as a Talking Points Memo commenter noticed, the story appears to be cribbed from a 2011 book called An Invisible Thread. Author Laura Schroff says it's the story of her friendship with Maurice. Her website says, \"We met on 56th street in Manhattan in 1986, when I was a 35-year-old single, successful ad sales executive, and he was an 11-year-old homeless panhandler.\" An except of the book:\n\nWonkette says, \"Somebody Is Stealing Children To Put In Paul Ryan Speeches!\" The Wire reached out to Anderson for comment; we'll update when we hear back. Update: Anderson tells The Washington Post that she saw an interview with Maurice Mazyck on TV, even though she'd previously told the story as if it happened to her. Her spokesman says she \"misspoke.\"\n\nBefore he launched into the brown bag story, Ryan was talking about how Obamacare will \"will discourage millions of people from working,\" causing the economy to shrink. (Maurice's circumstances in 1986, it's worth noting, were somewhat starker than having subsidized health insurance through Obamacare.)\n\nRyan's possibly stolen story spoke to a recurring theme at CPAC \u2014 people don't need a law to guarantee humane treatment, they just need compassion and understanding between two unregulated individuals. A few hours after Ryan spoke, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal reminded the audience that he was a \"pre-existing condition\" when his mom was pregnant with him. Jindal's father's insurance wouldn't cover the expenses of his birth. So Jindal's dad promised the doctor, \"I\u2019m going to pay you every month as much as I can\u2019\u2026 And that\u2019s exactly what they did.\" Jindal added, \u201cNo contracts. No paperwork. No government program. Just two guys in a hospital in Baton Rouge, shaking hands.\u201d Whatever you think of the conclusions Jindal draws from this story, at least it's his own.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday,\u00a0Paul Ryan told a touching anecdote of a poor boy who said he didn't want a free lunch at school, but a brown bag one, because \"a kid who had a brown paper bag had someone who cared for him.\"", "title": "News, opinion and aggregation on business, politics, entertainment, technology, global and national \u2013 The Wire", "og": {"site_name": "The Wire", "description": "At the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday,\u00a0Paul Ryan told a touching anecdote of a poor boy who said he didn't want a free lunch at school, but a brown bag one, because \"a kid who had a brown paper bag had someone who cared for him.\"", "title": "Paul Ryan's Heartwrenching Tale of a Hungry Kid Also Appears in a Heartwrenching Book", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/03/06/AP231631285756/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.thewire.com/politics/2014/03/paul-ryans-heartwrenching-story-about-hungry-kid-also-appears-heartwrenching-book/358902/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At the Conservative Political Action Conference on Thursday,\u00a0Paul Ryan told a touching anecdote of a poor boy who said he didn&#39;t want a free lunch at school, but a brown bag one, because \"a kid who had a brown paper bag had someone who cared for him.\"", "title": "Paul Ryan's Heartwrenching Tale of a Hungry Kid Also Appears in a Heartwrenching Book", "image": "http://cdn.thewire.com/media/img/upload/wire/2014/03/06/AP231631285756/lead_large.jpg", "creator": "@elspethrb", "site": "@thewire", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "app_id": 192759427473466}, "keywords": "The Wire, TheWire.com, TheWire.com, news, opinion, aggregation, business, politics, entertainment, technology, global, national", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheAtlanticWire"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b00\"", "article_summary": "He wanted one, he said, because he knew a kid who had a brown paper bag had someone who cared for him.\nHe wanted his own lunch, one in a brown paper bag, just like the other kids.\nAnd every day at school, he would get a free lunch from a government program.\nBefore he launched into the brown bag story, Ryan was talking about how Obamacare will \"will discourage millions of people from working,\" causing the economy to shrink.\nHe told Eloise, he didn't want a free lunch."}
