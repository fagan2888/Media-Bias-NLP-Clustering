It serves the southern Sequoia region of California's Central Valley.\n\n[Also: NorthShore University using predictive analytics for on-demand healthcare staffing]\n\nThe John XXIII Health Clinic at Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County, a 60-year-old social services organization, will likewise benefit from CEP America's physician staffing and oversight. The latter group will provide physician supervision via telephone for an onsite physician assistant who sees patients twice a week. Once per week, a CEP physician will also be onsite to support two Kaiser Permanente internal medicine residents.\n\n\"We opened the clinic in 2014 to offer integrated primary and behavioral healthcare and social services to diverse people falling through the cracks of our medical system,\" said Jackie Copeland-Carson, COO of Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County, in a statement. She said the partnership will allow the group to expand its primary care services.\n\nNeighborhood Healthcare-Valley Parkway in Escondido, meanwhile, will receive a boost from CEP's urgent care services. The center provides primary care services to patients of all ages and is expanding its evening and weekend hours to increase access for medical care. The facility is within walking distance to three other health centers.\n\nTwitter: @JELagasse", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/cep-america-staffs-three-acute-healthcare-providers-california", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/sierraviewfeat.png", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Acute care management provider CEP America is partnering with three California healthcare providers -- Sierra View Medical Center, Neighborhood Healthcare in Escondido, and the Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County -- to deliver medical services to patients beginning this month.", "title": "CEP America staffs three acute healthcare providers in California"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/sierraviewfeat.png"}, "description": "Acute care management provider CEP America is partnering with three California healthcare providers -- Sierra View Medical Center, Neighborhood Healthcare in Escondido, and the Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County -- to deliver medical services to patients beginning this month.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CEP America staffs three acute healthcare providers in California"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Acute care management provider CEP America is partnering with three California healthcare providers -- Sierra View Medical Center, Neighborhood Healthcare in Escondido, and the Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County -- to deliver medical services to patients beginning this month.&#13; Imamu Tomlinson, MD, president of CEP, said in a statement that his organization had the resources to serve each of its partnering entities.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Acute care management provider CEP America is partnering with three California healthcare providers -- Sierra View Medical Center, Neighborhood Healthcare in Escondido, and the Catholic Charities of Santa Clara County -- to deliver medical services to patients beginning this month.\nOnce per week, a CEP physician will also be onsite to support two Kaiser Permanente internal medicine residents.\nShe said the partnership will allow the group to expand its primary care services.\nThe center provides primary care services to patients of all ages and is expanding its evening and weekend hours to increase access for medical care.\nNeighborhood Healthcare-Valley Parkway in Escondido, meanwhile, will receive a boost from CEP's urgent care services."}
