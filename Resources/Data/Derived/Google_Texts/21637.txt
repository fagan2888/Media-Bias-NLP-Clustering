The nearly 80,000 people coming through downtown Wichita for Garth Brooks tour increased some businesses quota by 12 times.

Louis Lopez says he prepared his restaurant, Lou's Charcuteria, to handle three times the normal business. Lopez says his business quadrupled what he prepared for.

"People everywhere, people having a great time, I cannot believe how great it has been," Lopez said.

Garth Brooks preformed six shows in Wichita, selling out Intrust Bank Arena each show.

It was the first time in 17 years the Brooks had performed in Wichita.
