Care Health Plan said it had contracted with PayNearMe to give its insurance exchange enrollees the option of paying premiums with cash (HEX E-Alert, 4/22/15). A few months earlier, Humana Inc. unveiled a similar arrangement through its partnership with CVS Health\u2019s retail division and InComm, an electronic payment network. Other health plans are eyeing such strategies that give members more ways to pay their premiums.\n\nPrior to the launch of public insurance exchanges in 2013, an estimated 41 million individuals lacked health coverage \u2014 about half of them either didn\u2019t have a bank account, or had one but relied on alternative financial services, such as payday loans.\n\nPrior to the enactment of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), health plans generally weren\u2019t equipped to accept any form of payment outside of payroll deduction, notes David Vielehr, senior vice president and general manager of InComm Healthcare & Affinity.\n\nWhile hospitals and physician offices have long been able to process credit cards at the point of service, \u201chealth plans see credit card payments as being too costly due to interchange and transaction fees,\u201d he adds.\n\nInComm was formed in 1992 to allow people to purchase prepaid long distance telephone minutes with cash. The company is now one of the world\u2019s largest issuers of prepaid Visa and MasterCard debit cards. It moved into the health care space in 2011. Including CVS stores, InComm\u2019s cash bill pay retail footprint includes about 20,000 retail locations nationally. Vielehr anticipates adding more health plan clients this summer.\n\nSince the beginning of last fall\u2019s open-enrollment period, people who select exchange-based plans from Humana can pay premiums at any participating CVS/pharmacy location. A barcode printed at the bottom of its statements can be scanned at the checkout where the member can use cash, credit or debit to pay all or part of the premium.\n\nUsing the same barcode, a member could break up a monthly premium into four weekly payments. Humana sells coverage through exchanges in a dozen states, while CVS/pharmacy is the retail division of CVS Health, which operates more than 7,600 drugstores nationally. About 2% of Humana\u2019s exchange members pay in cash through InComm. Humana partnered with CVS in 2013 to educate individuals and their families about their health care coverage options under the ACA.\n\nWant a Slurpee With That?\n\nAs an insurance carrier that caters to low-income populations, offering a cash option was a priority to L.A. Care\u2019s board of governors. In a case of serendipity, Laura Jaramillo, L.A. Care\u2019s director of commercial and group plan operations, was seated at a conference next to Trish Burgess-Curran, vice president of business development at PayNearMe. The two struck up a conversation. Jaramillo tells HEX she was intrigued by PayNearMe\u2019s technology because no personal health information is involved in the transactions.\n\nMembers receive a unique barcode via email or text, which is tied to their L.A. Care Covered account (L.A. Care\u2019s exchange product). Members can then print the barcode or take their smartphone to the cashier at a participating retail location, such as a 7-Eleven, along with their cash payment, as if they were making any other purchase. The cashier scans the barcode and accepts the payment, which is credited to the member\u2019s account within 24 hours, she explains. The program is being promoted through letters and postcards mailed to members. PayNearMe is relatively new to the health care space. The company\u2019s technology initially was aimed at utility payments, child support and rent.\n\nThe vast majority of L.A. Care\u2019s 1.7 million members are enrolled in a Medicaid managed care plan. About 21,000 people have enrolled in L.A. Care\u2019s exchange-based product, and approximately 19,000 have paid their premium. The carrier has just a handful of individual enrollees outside of Covered California, the state\u2019s insurance exchange.\n\nPayNearMe has 17,000 retail payment locations nationally, including nearly 2,000 in California.\n\nThe recent partnership with L.A. Care has prompted some new connections with insurance carriers and accelerated existing conversations, Burgess-Curran tells HEX.\n\nWhen the member is at a 7-Eleven or other retailer, the carrier or provider can tell the system to accept the payment and provide a confirmation receipt, or reject it and provide an explanatory receipt. \u201cThis is particularly important as insurers work to manage member payments around the 90-day grace period to reduce exposure to claims, retro-cancellations and reinstatements,\u201d says Burgess-Curran.\n\nBoth PayNearMe and InComm charge carriers a small fee per transaction, but allow the consumer to submit payment at no charge. The cost is 30% to 60% less than a typical credit card fee, according to Vielehr.\n\nCovered Calif. Considered Cash Rule\n\nIn fall 2013, the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) clarified that all qualified health plan (QHP) issuers must accept several types of payment such as checks, cashier\u2019s checks, money orders, direct bank transfers and debit cards. It didn\u2019t require that they accept cash payment, but that was clearly something they could allow if they chose, says Jenny Sullivan, director of Enroll America\u2019s Best Practices Institute.\n\nIn the months before launching in 2013, Covered California\u2019s board discussed requiring participating carriers to include a cash option for paying premiums. The exchange\u2019s leaders, however, opted against such a requirement after some pushback. \u201cSome carriers felt that it would be too complicated to pursue a cash option.\u2026Others didn\u2019t think the exchange should be setting specific premium payment policy,\u201d Jaramillo says.\n\nChildren\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (CHIPs) in California, Florida and several other states traditionally have accepted cash for premiums in select locations. Many CHIP enrollees have family members who have coverage through a public exchange, Sullivan notes. But such payments often must be made via prepaid credit card or with a money order through Western Union, which can be costly for consumers.\n\n\u201cSupporting unbanked and underbanked members has been a necessary focus for all health plans offering products through the federal and state marketplaces,\u201d says Mark Waterstraat, chief strategy officer and co-founder of Benaissance, a SaaS technology and premium payment processing company that works with exchanges. \u201cAll of our [health plan] customers have accepted pre-paid debit cards and money orders as forms of payment from the beginning. Many also accept cash for payment in their offices.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 2015 by Atlantic Information Services, Inc.
