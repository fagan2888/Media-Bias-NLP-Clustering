But after reading Jeffrey Goldberg\u2019s immense article on \u201cThe Obama Doctrine\u201d in the Atlantic, which was based on several lengthy interviews with the president and his inner circle of advisors, I suspect Obama also knows that the charge contains a germ of truth, on a deep karmic or psychological level most of his critics are unlikely to grasp.\n\nGoldberg\u2019s Obama magnum opus is well written, highly intelligent and impressively researched. It\u2019s also massively narcissistic and sycophantic, in vintage Beltway-insider style, marinating in details and locations and celebrating its author\u2019s access to power. We\u2019re in the White House dining room, or John Kerry\u2019s private office at the State Department, or aboard Air Force One on the runway in Kuala Lumpur. We are discussing serious things: the perceived personality defects of Vladimir Putin, the contemporary relevance of Thomas Hobbes\u2019 \u201cLeviathan,\u201d and the importance of America\u2019s relationship to Asia \u2014 a question Obama hoped would be central to his presidency that got trumped, or Trumped, by other concerns.\n\nEven as Goldberg sinks, little by little, into the swamp of Washington groupthink \u2014 honestly, he should know better than to refer to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the late Venezuelan president, as a \u201cdictator\u201d \u2014 he teases out an intriguing portrait of the blend of caution, calculation and hopefulness that have characterized Obama\u2019s foreign policy. Through it all, we can also discern a depiction of the president\u2019s central flaw. It may not be a flaw at all, depending on your view of such things; it is certainly preferable to other flaws we could name. (Obama is presumed to favor Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders, but Clinton is portrayed throughout the Goldberg article as an incautious military interventionist who drove the administration\u2019s disastrous Libya policy and wanted to compound the error in Syria. It\u2019s a lot more like an indictment than an endorsement.)\n\nObama is frequently described as cool or sardonic or detached or analytical or deliberative; he is without doubt the most intellectually gifted American president in many decades. (Woodrow Wilson would be the most recent candidate, and before him probably Lincoln.) But what underlies Obama\u2019s impressive book-learning and nuanced strategic thinking is a well-known failing of the intellectual class: He doesn\u2019t seem to know much about human nature, and appears continually surprised by how stupid, fearful and irrational his fellow citizens and fellow planetary inhabitants are. He has read more than enough of Hobbes and John Locke, more than enough foreign-policy papers by officials of the George H.W. Bush administration. (His avatar in that field is, no kidding, Brent Scowcroft, which explains a lot.) He\u2019s a little short, so to speak, on Freud and Nietzsche, on \u201cSympathy for the Devil\u201d and \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d and \u201cBlue Velvet.\u201d\n\nTo my mind, the most illuminating of Goldberg\u2019s numerous Obama-up-close anecdotes is the one about the presidential press conference at a G20 summit in Turkey last November, a few days after the ISIS attacks in Paris that killed 130 people. Obama seemed increasingly exasperated and puzzled that the press corps never asked him about climate change or the conflict in Ukraine or the Iranian nuclear negotiations or any other possible summit topics. Every question was about ISIS and terrorism, culminating in a CNN reporter\u2019s infamous outburst: \u201cWhy can\u2019t we take out these bastards?\u201d\n\nThat was the week when Trump first proposed barring all Muslims from entering the United States, a suggestion that all normal and reasonable people immediately rejected as outrageous \u2014 and that propelled him to a huge lead in the Republican campaign he has yet to surrender. Every Republican elected official everywhere in the country seized on the Syrian refugee crisis as a potential wedge issue, demanding that no more migrants be admitted under any circumstances (except maybe the Christians, in Ted Cruz\u2019s iteration). Obama barely appeared to have noticed any of this. An unnamed official told Goldberg that it wasn\u2019t until the next day, after a flight to Manila, that the president\u2019s advisors figured out that \u201ceveryone back home had lost their minds.\u201d\n\nWhoever said that \u2014 it may have been Obama himself \u2014 was entirely correct. America\u2019s reaction to the Paris attacks came pretty close to mass hysteria, and had nothing to do with the actual danger represented by ISIS, which was and is insignificant. There are many valid criticisms to raise about Obama\u2019s approach to foreign policy and national security, including the dubious effects of the drone war and his administration\u2019s obsessive crackdown on leakers and whistleblowers. But we have been very fortunate, in my judgment, to have had a president for seven-plus years who has valued logic over panic when it comes to the issue of Islamic terrorism, and who has consistently sought to frame that problem in global and historical terms and not to exaggerate its importance.\n\nI\u2019m delighted to learn, via Goldberg, that Obama often reminds his staff that far more Americans die every year from falls in the bathtub than die at the hands of Muslim terrorists. (John Kerry, on the other hand, comes off like a raving lunatic, envisioning a future in which ISIS destroys European society and leads to the return of 1930s-style fascism. Thank Christ he didn\u2019t get elected.) I can understand why he doesn\u2019t say this stuff in public, but Obama is justified in describing Syria \u2014 and, by extension, the larger quagmire of the Middle East \u2014 as a \u201cshit show\u201d that won\u2019t be solved during his presidency or the next one or the one after that. On any logical basis, it\u2019s difficult to challenge his argument that the least bad choice in Middle East policy is to disentangle and disconnect to the greatest extent possible and pivot toward America\u2019s relationship with the developing nations of Asia, Africa and Latin America, where constructive change is far more achievable.\n\nBut Americans, as you may have noticed, don\u2019t do logic all that well. We do fear and passion and soaring guitar chords and \u201cfreedom isn\u2019t free.\u201d We love tough talk and paranoid fantasies and bizarre, apocalyptic delusions. Obama is a master of political oratory, which is what got him elected in the first place. But given his apparent puzzlement that the stupid, primitive and seductive passions that run throughout human history \u2014 and the deranged current of jingoistic nationalism that runs throughout American history \u2014 have not been conclusively vanquished by the light of reason, he still adds up to the strangest and unlikeliest president ever. So I think it\u2019s about halfway true that Obama\u2019s persistent mode of cool drove us crazy and paved the way for the empty hotness of Trump, although it\u2019s a lot more true to say that we were already crazy and Trump was ready and waiting.", "article_metadata": {"description": "No, Republicans, you can't blame Obama.
