The night before, former President Clinton spoke at a dinner for attendees at the Oceanaire Seafood Room.\n\n\u201cI like it more each year,\u201d said Janet Davas, a New Orleans-based social enterprise consultant attending the conference for the third time. At last year\u2019s conference she met both former President Clinton and Hillary Clinton, an experience she described as \u201cthrilling.\u201d\n\nThe marathon networking and business-card trading was yet to wear on many by Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cActually not as stuffy as one might think,\u201d Jarvez Hall, an outreach manager for the Small Business Majority, said of the conference. Hall\u2019s group, based in Washington, D.C., works in 12 states to advocate for small-business owners.\n\n\u201cI go to some knock-down, drag-out water conferences, so for me this is great,\u201d Eklund said.\n\nBeyond Clinton appearances and time with like-minded experts and thinkers, attendees were wowed by the host city. This is Denver\u2019s second consecutive year hosting the conference. Attendees from the east coast, like the Manhattan-based Stacey Bossard, whose organization works to find jobs for veterans, were especially struck.\n\n\u201cI needed this,\u201d she said, noting the thrill of waking up to see snow-capped mountains in the distance.\n\nMatthew Nussbaum: 303-954-1666, mnussbaum@denverpost.com or twitter.com/MatthewNussbaum", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CGI attendees enjoy Clintons, each other and host city", "title": "CGI attendees enjoy Clintons, each other and host city", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/06/09/cgi-attendees-enjoy-clintons-each-other-and-host-city/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150609__CGIp1.jpg", "height": 385}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150609__CGIp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-09T16:50:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T08:13:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28d1\"", "article_summary": "The night before, former President Clinton spoke at a dinner for attendees at the Oceanaire Seafood Room.\nBeyond Clinton appearances and time with like-minded experts and thinkers, attendees were wowed by the host city.\nThe conference, focused on issues of education and economic development in the United States, entered its second day at the downtown Sheraton.\nAttendees from the east coast, like the Manhattan-based Stacey Bossard, whose organization works to find jobs for veterans, were especially struck.\n\u201cI needed this,\u201d she said, noting the thrill of waking up to see snow-capped mountains in the distance."}
