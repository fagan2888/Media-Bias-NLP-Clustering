Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton will campaign for Democratic U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan at an early vote event in Charlotte.

Hagan's campaign said Saturday that Clinton will participate in the early vote event Oct. 25 at the Charlotte Convention Center. Early voting begins two days earlier, on Thursday, Oct. 23.

Tickets are required and are free. They're available at various campaign offices in the Charlotte region.

Hagan is locked in a tight race for re-election with Republican House Speaker Thom Tillis.
