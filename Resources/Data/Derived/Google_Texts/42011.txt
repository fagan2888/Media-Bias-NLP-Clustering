Two more arms were added to the Washington Nationals bullpen on Friday. Left-handed veteran Oliver Perez and right-hander Shawn Kelley agreed to terms with the club, the team announced.

Perez, 34, signed a two-year contract. He was a starter who has found new life as a reliever. His resurrection began in 2012 with the Seattle Mariners. After posting a 6.80 ERA with the New York Mets in 2010, Perez was out of baseball. He made the Mariners’ roster in 2012 after a strong spring training performance when he showed an increase in velocity. He finished with a 2.12 ERA that season and has been a power matchup against left-handed batters since. Lefties hit .185 versus Perez last season.

Though his last three seasons have shown him to fade late in the year. From 2013-15, his ERA in August is 5.79. In September, it’s 6.10. The Nationals could use Perez almost exclusively against left-handed batters, freeing Felipe Rivero for a setup role in the seventh or eighth inning.

Last season was the best of Kelley’s career. With the San Diego Padres, Kelley put together a 2.45 ERA along with a 1.09 WHIP. Keeping with his career numbers, Kelley struck out more than a batter per inning, finishing 2015 with 11.05 strikeouts per nine innings.

During his final 45 appearances of the 2015 season, Kelley went 2-0 with a 1.05 ERA. Right-handed batters hit .215 against Kelley last season. From May 30 through the end of the year, Kelley did not allow an extra-base hit to a right-handed batter, a stretch that spanned the final 98 right-handed hitters he faced. He signed a three-year deal.

Earlier in the week, the Nationals also signed right-handed Yusmeiro Petit. A former starter, Petit can be used as a long man out of the bullpen. Petit had a 3.67 ERA for the San Francisco Giants last season.

With the addition of Kelley, the Nationals currently have 39 players on their 40-man roster
