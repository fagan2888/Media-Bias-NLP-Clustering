The updates are expected to:\n\nAllow consumers to compare whether different exchange plans cover specific physicians, hospitals or medications;\n\nhelp the website to provide more accurate estimates of plans\u2019 total annual out-of-pocket costs, including premiums, deductibles and copayments; and\n\nbolster smartphone and tablet usability.\n\nHowever, things don\u2019t appear to be going smoothly as planned upgrades to the site which were expected to debut during the Affordable Care Act\u2019s upcoming open enrollment being potentially delayed because of testing setbacks, according to The Associated Press .\n\nAccording to CMS Communications Director Lori Lodes, the Obama administration is \u201cworking closely with the insurance companies to make sure their data is accurate and validated and to identify and fix any potential issues\u201d with the upgrades, the Sacramento Bee reported. And America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) spokesperson Clare Krusing stated that while the updated tools will provide \u201cimportant data for consumers to have,\u201d she asserted that it is \u201ceven more important that the tools are working as intended. Individuals should confirm with their health plan that their specific providers and medications are including before picking their coverage during open enrollment.\u201d\n\nThe website testing is being done in collaboration with insurers, and parties on both sides are casting blame for the unresolved issues reports The Times. Insurers claim government officials did not adequately test the tools, while the feds say only about half of insurers submitted requested data on their providers and drugs in the requested format by Oct. 1.\n\nHealthCare.gov has also updated its privacy protections, including a new privacy manager that allows consumers to opt-out of third party tools that the site uses to collect data, according Kevin Counihan, CEO of the federal marketplace. \u201cIf you choose to opt-out, you\u2019ll still have access to everything on the site, but we won\u2019t use information from your visit to analyze the site\u2019s technical performance or use digital advertising to remind you about helpful information like deadlines,\u201d Counihan wrote. \u201cThe Internet is constantly changing, and we have an obligation to keep evolving alongside it. We\u2019ll keep re-evaluating our own privacy notice, the tools we use and how they intersect with the evolving landscape of privacy on the Web. We are committed to protecting the information you entrust with us at HealthCare.gov.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"description": "<p>Testing on new features of the government&rsquo;s online marketplace is going down to the wire. <em>By Christine Kern, contributing writer</em></p>", "title": "Efforts To Fix Healthcare.Gov Bugs Before November 1 Deadline Intensify", "image": {"src": "http://vertassets.blob.core.windows.net/image/5ee9666e/5ee9666e-4605-48fe-9042-5cbc15f76dec/approaching_deadline.jpg"}, "creator": "Christine Kern", "site": "HITOutcomes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Testing on new features of the government&rsquo;s online marketplace is going down to the wire.
