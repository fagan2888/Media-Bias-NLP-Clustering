They suggested this might not be the best P.R. approach. Unfortunately, the poor fellow who made that mistake was smacked down hard by the NRA suits and they publicly apologized. It seems even they don\u2019t have the freedom to say what they think about guns without getting some blowback from people who have serious firepower and aren\u2019t afraid to use it \u2014 their own members. The New York Times reported on the flap at the time:\n\n\u201cThe truth is, an alert went out that referred to this type of behavior as \u2018weird\u2019 or somehow not normal, and that was a mistake. It shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d Chris W. Cox, the group\u2019s chief lobbyist, said in an interview on Tuesday on an N.R.A.-hosted program that was posted on the group\u2019s website on Wednesday. \u201cThe National Rifle Association supports open carry,\u201d Mr. Cox said. \u201cWe support concealed carry. We have led the charge across the country to not only protect our members\u2019 rights to self-defense, but to expand it.\u201d\n\nIt would appear that Texas gun owners want to expand their rights yet again. And you won\u2019t believe what new right their creator endowed them with this time: the right to sell alcohol at gun shows. What could go wrong?\n\nRight now, the state doesn\u2019t allow venues with liquor licenses to sell booze until after the show is finished and everything\u2019s been put away. But a Dallas gun club wanted to be able to party while they purchase their firearms and the alcohol control board figured it was a good idea. They did stipulate that the guns be \u201cdisabled\u201d and that you could not pick up your shiny new gun at the show. But it still sounds like a rollicking good time.\n\nThe NRA, however, sounds very skeptical about this plan. It put out another one of those \u201cadvisories\u201d telling members that this new rule could \u201cdevastate\u201d NRA events in Texas. They claim that it would prevent the Friends of the NRA from meeting at hotels and other places where alcohol is served (even if there was no alcohol at the event). This would lead to a shortfall in fundraising for the NRA, a truly devastating prospect. (They don\u2019t say it, but it\u2019s fair to assume this would have a devastating effect on the state\u2019s economy as a whole considering just how many of these gun shows and other gatherings seem to be scheduled on any given day in Texas.) But they claim that the real rub, naturally, is the idea that these events would require that guns be \u201cdisabled\u201d and that the responsible drunk gun owner would be unable to take his new weapon home that very day. (Undoubtedly, the founders turned over in their graves at the idea of such authoritarianism in the land of the free. What is this, Cuba?)\n\nIt would seem the NRA learned its lesson. Rather than telling its members that they are scaring the public by proposing to do something so ridiculously dumb that only a zealot or a fool would even propose it, they have very cleverly spun the proposed event to be an infringement on their God-given Second Amendment rights rather than an expansion of it. If they handle this carefully they may even get their responsible gun owners to hold some open-carry events at the alcohol control board meeting. They can demonstrate their reverence for the Constitution directly and make it clear that they won\u2019t stand for having their rights restricted by allowing them to drink alcohol while they purchase their deadly weapons. That\u2019ll show \u2019em.\n\nThe NRA is protecting its brand. They undoubtedly know very well that the evidence shows guns and booze are a very lethal combination. (Common sense shows that.) In fact, scientific studies reveal that gun owners are particularly vulnerable to the siren call of the demon rum. This survey from the British Medical Journal paints a picture of a population that is a serious risk to public safety. According to Melissa Healey of the L.A. Times, the data are quite frightening.
