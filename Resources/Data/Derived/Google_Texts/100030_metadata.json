Paul Zoeller/Staff\n\nCOLUMBIA \u2014 Tensions ran high between the Clemson football team and South Carolina student section in the north end zone of Williams-Brice Stadium, including debris being thrown at halftime and a scary postgame incident, but there doesn\u2019t appear to be significant long-term concerns following USC\u2019s 31-17 victory Saturday night.\n\nThe visiting tunnel at South Carolina\u2019s home stadium exits through the northwest corner of the field, just in front of the Gamecocks\u2019 student fans. It is fairly narrow, requiring a few extra moments for players, coaches and support staff to bottleneck into the locker room.\n\nJust after Clemson kicker Chandler Catanzaro booted a 38-yard field goal to cut South Carolina\u2019s halftime lead to 17-10, there were words exchanged between the visiting team and host fans, with bottles and other objects tossed in the direction of the Tigers.\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s college football. It\u2019s disappointing that people are throwing bottles, because people could get hurt,\u201d Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney said. \u201cIt\u2019s not representative of their team or their coaches. That\u2019s disappointing, because it\u2019s dangerous. Guys are out there competing, trying to play at the highest level. You hate to see things like that, but that\u2019s just part of it.\u201d\n\nThen at the conclusion of the game, the final few players were delayed on their way into the Tigers\u2019 locker room when a Clemson staffer and USC student were involved in a physical altercation, according to event staff and multiple students who witnessed the actions.\n\nThousands of fans lingered in the bleachers well after the final whistle, while Missouri-Texas A&M was being broadcast on the Jumbotron, a game affecting South Carolina\u2019s fate in the race for an SEC championship game bid. About 10 minutes after the Tigers left the field, a few students who saw the fracas said stadium security personnel quickly whisked the Clemson staffer away from the stands.\n\nSouth Carolina spokesman Steve Fink wrote in a Sunday afternoon email to the Post and Courier: \u201cLaw enforcement has no reports or charges involving anyone from the Clemson team.\u201d\n\nSwinney and Clemson spokesman Tim Bourret indicated nobody involved with the Tigers was injured.\n\nSouth Carolina has beaten Clemson five straight years, its longest winning streak in the series. The rivalry returns to Death Valley on Nov. 29, 2014.\n\nTwo painful losses\n\nIn 2012, Clemson went 10-2 in the regular season, with losses to ACC champion Florida State and South Carolina.\n\nIn 2013, Clemson went 10-2 in the regular season, with losses to ACC Atlantic champion Florida State and South Carolina.\n\nSwinney is not about to trade half his season to get one or both of those back. But it stings perhaps even worse against the top-ranked Seminoles and No. 8 Gamecocks.\n\n\u201cObviously we want to win them all. I don\u2019t wish that we lose any,\u201d Swinney said. \u201cI wish the two losses were different because those are two big rival games for us. But three 10-win seasons in a row; nobody wants to celebrate that or hear that right now, but I think you do have to have some perspective and step back and know how hard it is to win games consistently.\u201d\n\nThe No. 13 Tigers turned the ball over 10 times in their two losses this season, and 12 times in their 10 victories.\n\n\u201cTonight was a bad night. Our other loss was the same way,\u201d Swinney said. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in our performance in these two big opportunities that we had. Florida State and South Carolina are two of our rivals, two games that have huge implications for us.\n\n\u201cBut one of those teams (FSU) is about to play for the national championship, and South Carolina\u2019s been as consistent as anybody in the country as well.\u201d\n\nUnacceptable losses\n\nClemson junior defensive tackle Grady Jarrett has been regarded as the defense\u2019s emotional leader, and the normally reserved Jarrett was indignant at his team\u2019s performance Saturday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s disappointing, when you put all the work in, and on game day you can\u2019t get it all together,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to take that one on the chin. Ain\u2019t no excuses.\u201d\n\nJarrett was asked if it was unacceptable to keep coming up short against the Gamecocks.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, man. Absolutely. It is,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cWe felt like we matched up with them really well. We knew coming into the game it would come down to execution. We personally felt like we were the better team with the matchups. You always feel that, but you\u2019ve got to come out and perform. We didn\u2019t have our best performance tonight.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Clemson team, South Carolina students involved in halftime, postgame incidents; no charges reported from Williams-Brice Stadium, Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nsouthcarolina, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews,", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 Tensions ran high between the Clemson football team and South Carolina student section in the north end zone of Williams-Brice Stadium, including debris being thrown at halftime and a scary postgame incident, but there doesn\u2019", "title": "Clemson team, South Carolina students involved in halftime, postgame incidents; no charges reported from Williams-Brice Stadium", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20131201/131209922/clemson-team-south-carolina-students-involved-in-halftime-postgame-incidents-no-charges-reported-from-williams-brice-stadium", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20131201/PC20/131209922/AR/0/AR-131209922.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20131201/PC20/131209922/AR/0/AR-131209922.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 Tensions ran high between the Clemson football team and South Carolina student section in the north end zone of Williams-Brice Stadium, including debris being thrown at halftime and a scary postgame incident, but there doesn\u2019", "title": "Clemson team, South Carolina students involved in halftime, postgame incidents; no charges reported from Williams-Brice Stadium", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@hsprepzone", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20131201/PC20/131209922/AR/0/AR-131209922.jpg?201312012001", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 131209922}}, "keywords": "Clemson team, South Carolina students involved in halftime, postgame incidents; no charges reported from Williams-Brice Stadium , Sports, \r\nSportsClemson, \r\nsouthcarolina, \r\nFP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNews", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-01T17:53:27Z", "modified_time": "2013-12-01T20:01:00Z", "author": "Aaron Brenner"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "COLUMBIA \u2014 Tensions ran high between the Clemson football team and South Carolina student section in the north end zone of Williams-Brice Stadium, including debris being thrown at halftime and a scary postgame incident, but there doesn\u2019"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd16e2\"", "article_summary": "Florida State and South Carolina are two of our rivals, two games that have huge implications for us.\nIn 2013, Clemson went 10-2 in the regular season, with losses to ACC Atlantic champion Florida State and South Carolina.\nSouth Carolina has beaten Clemson five straight years, its longest winning streak in the series.\nTwo painful lossesIn 2012, Clemson went 10-2 in the regular season, with losses to ACC champion Florida State and South Carolina.\nSouth Carolina fans boo and throw bottles at Clemson as they leave the field at the end of the half during their football game Saturday, Nov. 30, 2013 at Williams-Brice Stadium."}
