Matt Bevin\u2019s administration has rolled out Benefind, an umbrella portal for state benefits.\n\nSo-called Kynectors \u2014 state workers and volunteers tasked with helping Kentuckians navigate the health exchange \u2014 said new regulations require them to refer most applicants to the Department of Community Based Services, a state agency that manages Benefind, which has been plagued by confusion and long wait times.\n\nThe Bevin administration, which has acknowledged the problems with Benefind, said the crunch is caused by an automatic review of cases where information from Kynect and the former state benefits program, KAMES, didn\u2019t match.\n\nThe shift to the new system has disrupted the flow of services to thousands of Kentuckians, according to the state workers tasked with helping them.\n\n\u201cCases where information between the Kynect case and legacy case did not match (for example, household composition or income) are required to be managed by a state agent before they can be acted upon by agents or Kynectors,\u201d Jessica Ditto, Bevin\u2019s communications director, wrote in an email. \u201cThis constraint has been placed to protect program and data integrity \u2014 plus, this is required by federal law.\u201d\n\nOver the past few years, more than 400,000 Kentuckians have signed up for expanded Medicaid through Kynect, the state health exchange implemented by former Gov. Steve Beshear. Bevin has promised to dismantle the service, leaving Benefind in its place.\n\nDitto said there are about 51,000 cases currently under review.\n\nRelated Story As Bevin Dismantles Kynect, A Bumpy Rollout For Its Replacement\n\nDitto said the backup is only temporary while DCBS workers resolve differences between conflicting case files of people who receive benefits.\n\n\u201cOnce those are reconciled, the cases will become open for Kynectors and agents again, just as before,\u201d Ditto wrote.\n\nAt present, Kynectors can only sign up individuals for health insurance through Kynect if those people are applying for health insurance and haven\u2019t ever received other state benefits.\n\nIf individuals are receiving non-health-related services like SNAP (formerly food stamps), KTAP (cash assistance) and child care assistance, Kynectors have to refer applicants to DCBS, which has been overwhelmed with requests.\n\nThe administration confirmed that the review process extends to anyone who has ever received a state benefit like SNAP or KTAP in the past.\n\nThe revelation is the latest in a series of glitches reported on the rollout of Benefind. Launched Feb. 29, the program has discontinued state services for some and erroneously notified thousands their benefits would be suspended, leading to a flood of complaints to state call centers and offices.\n\nOn Feb. 25, a 27-page \u201cWorker Portal Defect Workaround Guide\u201d was distributed to DCBS staff showing that the administration knew there would be problems with the Benefind rollout.\n\nVickie Yates Brown Glisson, secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said last week the state has hired 185 new DCBS workers to help address the problems.\n\nMeanwhile, the 500 state-contracted Kynectors aren\u2019t allowed to assist with many health insurance issues if applicants are involved with non-health programs in any way.\n\nState-funded Kynectors who spoke with Kentucky Public Radio wouldn\u2019t go on the record detailing the problems. A Kynector who confirmed the current situation expressed fear of retaliation from superiors in state government.\n\nQuestions about how Kynect operates under the Benefind program were referred to the governor\u2019s office or the Cabinet for Health and Family Services.\n\nRelated Story Bevin Administration Knew Of Benefind Problems Before Rollout\n\nCara Stewart, a law fellow with the Equal Justice Center and non-state-funded Kynector, said the Benefind rollout underutilizes the Kynector system.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking away all that functionality and all those resources,\u201d she said. \u201cYou call Kynect they have a two-minute wait time, you call DCBS it\u2019s over two hours \u2026 if you\u2019re lucky enough to get through.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, DCBS phone banks aren\u2019t open for as many hours under Bevin\u2019s watch.\n\nUnder the Beshear administration, DCBS workers were forced to work overtime to manage calls dealing with Kynect and Medicaid. Bevin rescinded that policy.\n\nEmily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, a health care advocacy group, said after the Benefind rollout, Kynectors aren\u2019t able to sign people up for health insurance as effectively.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re definitely trying their best, but their hands are tied in ways they didn\u2019t used to be,\u201d she said. \u201cThat lack of system functionality, coupled with the fact that there are so many fewer workers now that Kynectors\u2019 hands are tied, has led to this fiasco.\u201d\n\nOfficials from Beshear\u2019s administration have said the difficulties are due in part to Benefind taking over as the portal for expanded Medicaid services, which used to be handled exclusively by Kynect.\n\nBevin and Deloitte Consulting \u2014 which helped developed the $101 million system during the past few years \u2014 say the system was always designed to support Medicaid enrollees.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Kentucky workers and the Bevin administration are at odds over why backups with the new benefits system are occurring.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "89.3 WFPL", "description": "Kentucky workers and the Bevin administration are at odds over why backups with the new benefits system are occurring.", "title": "Fewer Kentucky Workers Able To Help With Benefind Problems", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 883, "identifier": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/benefind-home-page.png", "height": 620}, "updated_time": "2016-04-05T21:36:52-04:00", "url": "http://wfpl.org/fewer-kentucky-workers-able-help-benefind-problems/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kentucky workers and the Bevin administration are at odds over why backups with the new benefits system are occurring.", "creator": "@RylandKY", "image": "http://wfpl.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/benefind-home-page.png", "title": "Fewer Kentucky Workers Able To Help With Benefind Problems", "site": "@WFPLNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100006229511236, "pages": 33077174555, "app_id": 1539400482939529}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wfpllouisville", "section": "Politics", "tag": "steve beshear", "published_time": "2016-04-05T11:46:16-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-05T21:36:52-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Under the Beshear administration, DCBS workers were forced to work overtime to manage calls dealing with Kynect and Medicaid.\nFewer people are able to help Kentuckians sign up for health insurance through the state exchange and Medicaid now that Gov.\nThe shift to the new system has disrupted the flow of services to thousands of Kentuckians, according to the state workers tasked with helping them.\nVickie Yates Brown Glisson, secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said last week the state has hired 185 new DCBS workers to help address the problems.\nEmily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, a health care advocacy group, said after the Benefind rollout, Kynectors aren\u2019t able to sign people up for health insurance as effectively."}
