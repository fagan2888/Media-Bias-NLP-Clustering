If confirmed, he will take over for acting surgeon general Boris D. Lushniak, who stepped in when Regina Benjamin left the post in July.\n\nThe nominee was an early supporter of Obama and his health-care legislation, co-founding Doctors for Obama in 2008 and later transforming the group into Doctors for America, which promoted the health-care plan before it became law.\n\n\u201cMuch of your work has been devoted to electing the current president and advocating the new health-care law, all of which is your right to do as an American,\u201d said Sen. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), the ranking Republican on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. \u201cBut as a public official, if that becomes your principal purpose of the bully pulpit, that gets to be a problem.\u201d\n\nMurthy said that he has never viewed the Affordable Care Act as a perfect solution and that he promoted the plan as a step in the right direction.\n\nHe said of his view on surgeons general: \u201cThe role is not to be a legislator or a judge. The role is to be a public health educator.\u201d\n\nThe nominee said he would focus on issues with broad agreement, including obesity and tobacco-related illnesses, mental-health problems, reducing vaccine-preventable diseases and building community partnerships to \u201censure that all institutions in society play a role in prevention and health promotion.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the opposition, the health-care law has faced several problems, including the botched rollout of its Web site in the fall and frustration over policy cancellations for Americans whose insurance plans do not meet the law\u2019s requirements.\n\nDespite the early glitches, 3 million Americans had enrolled in plans through federal or state marketplaces as of Jan. 24.\n\nAlexander also raised questions about Murthy\u2019s support for stricter gun control, citing a number of postings on the nominee\u2019s Twitter account. On Oct. 16, Murthy wrote: \u201cTired of politicians playing politics w/ guns, putting lives at risk b/c they\u2019re scared of NRA. Guns are a health care issue. \u00ad#debatehealth.\u201d\n\nMurthy told the panel that his views on the issue will not come into play if he is confirmed. \u201cI do not intend to use my office as surgeon general as a bully pulpit on gun control,\u201d he said, adding that his position is based on experience treating victims of gun violence.\n\nAsked about his stance on marijuana legalization, Murthy said more research needs to be done about the drug\u2019s impacts before conclusions are drawn.\n\n\u201cJust like other drugs, I don\u2019t recommend marijuana, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good habit to use marijuana,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had kids, I would tell them not to use it.\u201d\n\nSen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), who heads the committee, described Murthy as an \u201cexemplary candidate\u201d for surgeon general. \u201cShould he be confirmed, Dr. Murthy\u2019s calm demeanor, his excellent ability to communicate with Americans from all backgrounds and his medical and public-health expertise will be invaluable assets,\u201d Harkin said.\n\nMurthy, the son of Indian immigrants, holds a bachelor\u2019s degree from Harvard and an MBA from the Yale School of Management. He received his medical degree from Yale. His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes founding Visions Worldwide, a nonprofit group dedicated to HIV/AIDS education, and TrialNetworks, a software company focused on making drug development and clinical trials more efficient.\n\nMurthy said his grandfather was a \u201cpoor farmer who fought for democracy and freedom in India,\u201d telling the panel that \u201che never could have dreamed that his grandson would have the opportunity to sit before you today to be considered for the position of surgeon general.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Vivek Murthy\u2019s past advocacy for the new health-care law was a focus of his Senate confirmation hearing.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jadam.hicks", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Vivek Murthy\u2019s past advocacy for the new health-care law was a focus of his Senate confirmation hearing.", "title": "Republicans question surgeon general nominee over his support for health-care law", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/republicans-question-surgeon-general-nominee-over-advocacy-for-health-care-law/2014/02/04/1e3798b0-8dcb-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@reporter_hicks"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/republicans-question-surgeon-general-nominee-over-advocacy-for-health-care-law/2014/02/04/1e3798b0-8dcb-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "surgeon general, obama nominees, obama nomination, surgeon general nominee, vivek murthy, vivek hallegere murthy,doctors for obama,doctors for america,senate help,senate help committee,federal news,federal eye,federal workers,federal employees,obama cabinet,barack obama,president obama,obamacare,affordable care act,health care,healthcare,health-care law,washington post,josh hicks, lamar alexander, tom harkin", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/jadam.hicks"}, "eomportal-uuid": "1e3798b0-8dcb-11e3-833c-33098f9e5267", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "surgeon general, obama nominees, obama nomination, surgeon general nominee, vivek murthy, vivek hallegere murthy,doctors for obama,doctors for america,senate help,senate help committee,federal news,federal eye,federal workers,federal employees,obama cabinet,barack obama,president obama,obamacare,affordable care act,health care,healthcare,health-care law,washington post,josh hicks, lamar alexander, tom harkin"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb88\"", "article_summary": "If confirmed, he will take over for acting surgeon general Boris D.
