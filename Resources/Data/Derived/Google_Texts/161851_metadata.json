Nelson to serve as chief executive officer of the nation\u2019s largest nonpartisan organization of state legislators.\n\nNelson, a former Visa Inc. executive and aide to Newt Gingrich, comes to ALEC from McLean, Va.-based Ulysses Consulting, where she served as managing partner, providing counsel to nonprofits and associations on coalition building and marketing development, according to her biography.\n\nNelson succeeds ALEC Executive Director Ron Scheberle and is charged with driving the strategic direction of the model state-legislation organization, according to a statement. She will be working with \u201cpublic and private sector leaders throughout the United States to increase the impact of the organization\u2019s limited government, free market and federalism priorities.\u201d\n\nLiberals and big-government advocates will take little comfort in the new chief executive for ALEC, the conservative lightning rod for the left in recent years.\n\nIowa state Rep. Linda Upmeyer, R-Clear Lake, who serves as the state House\u2019s majority leader and as national chairwoman of ALEC, said Nelson\u2019s work in state and national policy, as well as her experience building organizational infrastructure, is a \u201cperfect fit\u201d for ALEC as the organization \u201cstrengthens its focus\u201d on limited government, free markets and federalism.\n\n\u201cI am excited that as ALEC members work to return decision making to the states, Lisa will provide leadership and direction to the organization and a renewed commitment to finding solutions to challenges facing our states,\u201d Upmeyer said in a statement issued Monday.\n\nDuring her eight years as the director of global government relations for Visa, Nelson transformed the small domestic division into an \u201cintegrated, multinational function,\u201d according to her biography. She also served as senior vice president for external relations at AOL Time Warner, public affairs liaison to former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich and executive director of GOPAC, the GOP\u2019s state and local political training organization.\n\nRead More on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Liberals and big-government advocates will take little comfort in the new chief executive for the American Legislative Exchange Council.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Liberals and big-government advocates will take little comfort in the new chief executive for the American Legislative Exchange Council.", "title": "New Leader for American Legislative Exchange Council", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140709_ALEC_Watchdog.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1omyyW6"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Liberals and big-government advocates will take little comfort in the new chief executive for the American Legislative Exchange Council.", "title": "New Leader for American Legislative Exchange Council", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140709_ALEC_Watchdog.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "individual freedom", "published_time": "2014-07-10T10:30:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ALEC, American Legislative Exchange Council, Lisa Nelson, Lisa B.
