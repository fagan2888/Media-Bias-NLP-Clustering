As soon as I find out which world they're talking about, I'll let you know.\n\nBy the Numbers:\n\n11 days!!!\n\nDays 'til Hunger Games: Dumpster Diving for Meatloaf and Cabbage Pt. 2: 3\n\nDays 'til the Downtown Boise Tree Lighting in Idaho: 11\n\nPortion of Americans who are sickened each year by food-borne diseases, according to AP: 1-in-6\n\nNumber who die from them: 3,000\n\nCommerce Dept. estimate of the increase in retail sales for October: 0.1%\n\nLabor Dept. estimate of the drop in producers prices in October: 0.4%\n\nPercent of a dog's day spent lying around awake, according to Parade: 30%\n\nTuesday Words of Wisdom from the Right-wing Blogosphere:\n\nMarco Rubio is having a tough time getting love from the base, including the kiddies at Hot Air...\n\nRubio\u2019s attack on Cruz is: Hey, Cruz is a lying scumbag hypocrite like me! Rubio is pathetic. ---portlandon Go get your shoeshine box Marco.\n\n---madhess Rubio spent all of his political capital on passing Schumer\u2019s amnesty. Now, he is in debt, just like his credit card bills.\n\n---Redstone I may actually stay home if it\u2019s Rubio. ---Judgedredd\n\nAll together now: 1\u20262\u20263\u2026 Ouch.\n\n-\n\nPuppy Pic of the Day:\n\nAnd the ASPCA Dog of the Year is\u2026. <---Click now! Click now OMG OMG!!!!\n\n-\n\nCHEERS to the grownup in the room. As Republicans use the Paris attacks to unleash every xenophobic neocon warmonger fantasy rattling around in their heads, President Obama took a moment at the G-20 summit to make something clear to the armchair warriors: he's the effing commander-in-chief of this effing country, so eff off:\n\nWhoa. That\u2019s some high-level shit goin\u2019 on right there. Mr. Obama said he would intensify targeted airstrikes and assistance to local ground forces in Syria and Iraq, but it will take time to cripple the terrorist group. He dismissed critics who faulted his approach, accusing them of trying to profit politically from the episode. \u2026 [H]e said large numbers of American troops on the ground would repeat what he sees as the mistake of the Iraq invasion of 2003 and would not help solve the terrorism problem around the globe. \u2026 Victory over terrorist groups, he said, requires local populations to push back \u201cunless we\u2019re prepared to have a permanent occupation of these countries.\u201d Mr. Obama grew especially animated in rebuffing suggestions by some Republican presidential candidates, governors and lawmakers that the United States should block entry of Syrian refugees to prevent terrorists from slipping into the country. \u2026 Without naming him, Mr. Obama singled out a comment by former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, one of the Republicans seeking to succeed him, for suggesting the United States focus special attention on Christian refugees. \u201cThat\u2019s shameful,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s not American. It\u2019s not who we are. We don\u2019t have religious tests to our compassion.\u201d\n\nWhoa---Obama neutered him, thus confirming my suspicion: Barack can fix Jeb.\n\nP.S. Three days after the attacks, France sends a middle-finger salute to the terrorists:\n\nx Not sure she's ever been more beautiful than tonight. #EiffelTower #ViveLaFrance pic.twitter.com/9Ik9X582bz \u2014 Charli James (@charli) November 16, 2015\n\nCHEERS to smooth sailing (so far). The 2016 Obamacare enrollment season is underway, and not wanting to be a total procrastinator I decided to log on at healthcare.gov and check out my new options. Like last year---but unlike 2014, remember that?---it was a piece 'o cake: smooth, glitch-free, and it was especially helpful that a lot of last year's sign-up info was archived so I didn't have to start from scratch. And it sounds like most people are having the same experience:\n\nSign up for Obamacare now and get a year\u2019s supply of happy pills FREE! In all, 543,098 people selected plans for 2016 on HealthCare.gov in the first week, which began Nov. An unknown number signed up on the other 13 Obamacare exchanges run by individual states and the District of Columbia. For coverage to go into effect \u2014 and be officially counted \u2014 customers need to make their first month's premium payment. \u2026 \"Whether shopping for health insurance for the very first time or re-enrolling in their marketplace coverage, people are ready to get covered,\" [DHHS Secretary Sylvia] Burwell said. \"Consumers are coming to HealthCare.gov, having a smoother experience and finding plans they can afford.\" \u2026 Open enrollment runs from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31.\n\nCharles Gaba (aka Kossack Brainwrap) has his latest update here. Speaking for myself, it looks like I'll pay maybe 10 bucks more a month for the same \"silver\" plan I signed up for earlier this year. If I make it fifteen they'll add in-ambulance movies and free in-hospital nose plugs during meals.\n\nThis is Carson\u2019s jokey face.\n\nJEERS to the trapped rat. When Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson claimed over and over---based on sources that were \"better than the White House's\"---that the Chinese were active in Syria, the White House knew he was lying, the other candidates knew he was lying, the Chinese knew he was lying, you and I knew he was lying and he knew he was lying. The only question was how he was going to try and tiptoe out of the corner into which he'd painted himself. Now we know: clumsily\u2026\n\nBen Carson backtracked Monday on claims his foreign policy \u201csources are better\u201d than President Barack Obama\u2018s, telling reporters, \u201cthat was tongue in cheek.\u201d Carson said the suggestion that he has better sources than the president was intended as a joke, adding it \u201cwould be very alarming\u201d if his campaign had access to superior foreign policy advisors.\n\nSee? It was all just a joke! Very funny! Although not quite as funny as this joke: Knock knock. Who\u2019s there? Ben Carson. Ben Carson who? Ben Carson for President.\n\nCHEERS to disorder in a big jerk\u2019s court. Well, at least this has a happy ending. But what an emotional ordeal for the married lesbian couple in Utah who adopted a child and then, during a routine hearing, had their custody rights taken away by a right-wing activist judge on the grounds that lesbians make poor parents. Thanks to massive public pressure that hit him like a ton of bricks, Judge Scott Johansen not only overturned his decision but, as I write this, is actually running in his robe and Buster Browns west on I-80 as fast as he can to get as far away from the case as possible. But he's not out of the woods yet:\n\nJudge Johansen\u2019s gavel. On Monday, the Alliance for a Better Utah asked the Utah Legislature to begin impeachment proceedings against Johansen and launched a Web-based petition on change.org. \"If Judge Johansen wants to act like Judge Judy, then he should get a reality TV shot,\" Josh Kanter, the founder and board president said in a news release. \"Judge Johansen should be impeached and removed from office.\"\n\nIf Judge Johansen wanted to act like Judge Judy, he would've engaged brain before pounding gavel.\n\nJEERS to the hunchback of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Forty-two years ago today, in 1973, Richard Nixon uttered his immortal words: \"People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook.\" And to prove he wasn't a crook, Gerald Ford shielded him with a \"full and unconditional pardon\" after Nixon resigned rather than face impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors. The less you think about it, the more it makes perfect sense.\n\n-\n\nNine years ago in C&J: November 17, 2006\n\nCHEERS to making history. It's official---Nancy Pelosi is now the first-ever woman Speaker of the House and the first Democratic Speaker in 12 years. My gift to her: a pea shooter for use during Bush's State of the Union speech. (If you hit him behind the left kneecap he'll go down.)\n\n-\n\nAnd just one more\u2026\n\nCHEERS to cleansing your cosmic soul.\n\nWoodcutting of the 1833 Leonid meteor shower.\n\nThe Leonid Brezhnev meteor shower is putting on a display of Leonidiousness that peaks tonight:\n\nIt occurs when Earth crosses the orbital path of Comet Tempel-Tuttle, which, like all comets, litters its orbit with bits of debris. It\u2019s when this comet debris enters Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and vaporizes, that we see the Leonid meteor shower. In 2015, the peak night of the shower is expected from midnight to dawn on Wednesday morning (November 18). \u2026 The waxing moon will set in the evening hours, so moonlight will not obstruct this year\u2019s Leonid shower. Also, it\u2019ll be fun to look for the planet Jupiter, which shines in front of the constellation Leo this year. [\u2026] In recent years, people have gotten the mistaken idea that you must know the whereabouts of a meteor shower\u2019s radiant point in order to watch the meteor shower. You don\u2019t need to. The meteors often don\u2019t become visible until they are 30 degrees or so from their radiant point. They are streaking out from the radiant in all directions.\n\nEveryone agrees that meteor showers are beautiful, unite Americans in a common activity, and make lots of people happy and curious about the universe and the wonders of science. And in other news, Republicans in Congress plan to introduce a constitutional amendment banning all future meteor showers.\n\nHave a nice Tuesday, and thank you for putting up with the DK5 layout glitches, especially th. . . . . . . . . . e spacing\n\nissues. Floor's open...What are you cheering and jeering about today?\n\n-\n\nToday's Shameless C&J Testimonial: \u201cHere's my promise---Bill in Portland Maine will not be in my cabinet.\u201d ---Bernie Sanders\n\n-", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE\u2026 \r\n\r\n Happy Birthday, Howard! \r\n\r\n From signing the first civil unions bill in America that paved the way for the marriage-equality movement, to being ahead of his time o", "title": "Cheers and Jeers: Tuesday", "url": "http://www.dailykos.com/story/2015/11/17/1450539/-Cheers-and-Jeers-Tuesday", "image": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/6212/story_image/CheersAndJeers.jpg?1446935857", "type": "article"}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "fb": {"app_id": 170357783709}, "twitter": {"description": "From the GREAT STATE OF MAINE\u2026\r\n\r\nHappy Birthday, Howard!\r\n\r\nFrom signing the first civil unions bill in America that paved the way for the marriage-equality movement, to being ahead of his time on...", "creator": "@billinportland", "image": {"src": "http://images.dailykos.com/images/6212/story_image/CheersAndJeers.jpg?1446935857"}, "title": "Cheers and Jeers: Tuesday", "site": "@dailykos", "card": "summary"}}, "article_summary": "Cheers and Jeers for Tuesday, November 17, 2015Note: A reminder that Saturday is World Peace Day.\nIf Judge Johansen wanted to act like Judge Judy, he would've engaged brain before pounding gavel.\nIt\u2019s when this comet debris enters Earth\u2019s atmosphere, and vaporizes, that we see the Leonid meteor shower.\n[\u2026] In recent years, people have gotten the mistaken idea that you must know the whereabouts of a meteor shower\u2019s radiant point in order to watch the meteor shower.\n\"Judge Johansen should be impeached and removed from office.\""}
