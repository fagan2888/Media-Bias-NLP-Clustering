Boulder County commissioners on Thursday approved the Colorado Department of Transportation's proposal to restore and improve the wetlands and riparian ecosystem at 5665 Valmont Road.

The project, on about 12 acres of land owned by the city of Boulder, results from a CDOT commitment to do a wetlands restoration to offset the compromising of wetlands and riparian areas that occurred elsewhere, during construction of U.S. 36 highway improvements between Denver and Boulder, according to Boulder County's Land Use Department staff.

County staff planner Michelle Hoshide said the parcel where CDOT will be doing the wetlands restoration, about a quarter mile east of the intersection of Valmont and 55th Street, "has been significantly disturbed through past uses."

That included a former aggregate pit that was backfilled with construction debris, as well as the construction and later abandonment of a Pearl Street Parkway ramp.

The property "is currently littered with debris including rebar, concrete and asphalt, which has all been placed there to fill in the previous gravel pit," Hoshide said.

She said CDOT will remove the remnants of the Pearl Street Parkway ramp, re-grade the property to improve the hydraulics of an existing floodplain, and revegetate it with wetland, riparian and upland plantings. CDOT also has proposed rerouting an existing pedestrian trail on the south side of the property.

Dan Marcucci, a resident CDOT engineer, said that work on the wetlands restoration project may start in mid-July, depending in part on when the state agency gets its grading permit from the county.

No one spoke at the conmissioners' public hearing on the CDOT application before they voted unanimously to approve it.
