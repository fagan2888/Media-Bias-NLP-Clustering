Hillary Clinton today unveiled yet another proposal to increase taxes on Americans – this one costing taxpayers an estimated $150 billion over ten years.

At a campaign rally in Iowa, Clinton proposed a four percent “fair share surcharge” on income over $5 million a year.

Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist issued the following statement:

“Hillary is now the third Democrat presidential candidate to call for raising taxes on ‘the rich.’ Bill Clinton and Barack Obama said the same and immediately pivoted to raising taxes on the middle class. Bill taxed gasoline, and Obama imposed seven Obamacare taxes on the middle class. Hillary’s promise to raise taxes on ‘the rich’ is only the first part of the sentence: She left out I will raise taxes on the rich….first…then you. Her husband Bill made the same promise and then raised energy taxes, gasoline taxes on the middle class.”

Obama famously campaigned on a “firm pledge” against any tax hike on any American making less than $250,000. He shattered the promise with his signature on Obamacare, which contains at least seven tax hikes that directly and overwhelmingly hit middle income families. Hillary is now campaigning on a similar $250,000 promise.
