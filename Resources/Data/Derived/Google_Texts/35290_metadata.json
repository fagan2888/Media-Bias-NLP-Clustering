Nathan Johns said.\n\n\u201cA nurse practitioner can just do more than an LPN or RN can do,\u201d he said.\n\nThe nurse practitioner was added to the staff of two full-time nurses and one part-time nurse, Rowland said.\n\nThe nurse practitioner was hired at the jail in April 2014, said Rita Williams, Director of Marketing at Maury Regional Medical Center. She said MRMC partners with the jail to provide healthcare services.\n\nOver the summer, MRMC supplied the jail with the equipment needed to do laboratory work, Johns said.\n\nAccording to jail data, inmates paid 108 visits to outside medical clinics in January 2014, compared with 28 in December 2014, he said.\n\n\u201cThe big thing is, we\u2019re not transporting,\u201d Johns said. \u201cIt\u2019s safer for everyone involved, and there\u2019s less liability for the department.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s department has wanted to increase the medical services inmates receive on site for a long time, he said.\n\nJohns also said the population of the jail is fluid, with inmates being booked in and released each day. That makes it difficult for the story to be told using raw data alone.\n\n\u201cWe can have 300 inmates here at the beginning of the month, and have 300 at the end of the month,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they may not be the same 300.\u201d\n\nThe medical staff at the jail sees an average of 400 inmates per month, Rowland said.\n\nThe nurse practitioner is on-site Monday through Friday.\n\n\u201cOne of the RNs will come in on the weekends as well,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a huge plus.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Changes to medical care at the Maury County Jail have helped reduce the number of inmates who must be transported to outside visits to doctor\u2019s offices over the past year, Sheriff Bucky Rowland said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "KARA COLEMAN kcoleman@c-dh.net", "og": {"site_name": "Columbia Daily Herald", "description": "Changes to medical care at the Maury County Jail have helped reduce the number of inmates who must be transported to outside visits to doctor\u2019s offices over the past year, Sheriff Bucky Rowland said.", "title": "In-jail care saves time, money", "url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/jail-care-saves-time-money", "image": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/sites/columbiadailyherald.com/files/field/media/web1_Nurse-Practitioner-at-MCo-Jail_5725_swt.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://columbiadailyherald.com/news/local-news/jail-care-saves-time-money", "title": "In-jail care saves time, money", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thedailyherald"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1091992", "app_name": "columbiadailyherald", "package": "com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald"}, "ios": {"url": "columbiadailyherald://?eid=1091992", "app_store_id": 964773799, "app_name": "columbiadailyherald"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=964773799", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.stephensmedia.columbiadailyherald", "keywords": "Local News,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-18T18:57:07-06:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda89c\"", "article_summary": "The nurse practitioner was added to the staff of two full-time nurses and one part-time nurse, Rowland said.\n\u201cA nurse practitioner can just do more than an LPN or RN can do,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe have a nurse practitioner that came in the spring, and that\u2019s cut down on transports,\u201d Rowland said.\n\u201cBut they may not be the same 300.\u201dThe medical staff at the jail sees an average of 400 inmates per month, Rowland said.\nThe nurse practitioner is on-site Monday through Friday."}
