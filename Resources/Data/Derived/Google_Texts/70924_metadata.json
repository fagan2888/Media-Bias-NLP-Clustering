This is (King) George III. This is some monarch to say I am the law,\" Rove said on Fox News Sunday. Rove used the Affordable Care Act as an example for his argument. \"I actually read the Affordable Care Act. I can find little or no authority at all for the 39 exemptions that (President Obama\u2019s) gotten.\n\nRove said the George W. Bush administration \u2014 which he was a part of as a senior advisor and deputy chief of staff \u2014 did not abuse executive powers at the same level that Obama has. While the president has \"broad authority\" in international issues, Congress must be consulted when domestic policies, like those on immigration, are being created, Rove said. \"The legislative branch is the Congress,\" Rove said. The Constitution \"does not say the legislative power is shared between the president and the Congress.\"\n\nPlay Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle Plus\n\nEmbed Boehner Explains Basis of Possible Obama Lawsuit 0:50 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog\n\nIN-DEPTH\n\nSOCIAL\n\n.@RepGoodlatte on Executive Overreach: We have the power to bring causes of action when we think he is trampling over the constitution #FNS \u2014 FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) June 29, 2014\n\n.@RepBecerra on Executive Overreach: President Obama is implementing the law, not re-writing it #FNS \u2014 FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) June 29, 2014\n\n\u2014 Elisha Fieldstadt", "article_metadata": {"description": "Karl Rove said President Barack Obama is abusing his executive powers by failing to consult with Congress.", "og": {"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/rove-calls-obamas-executive-actions-imperial-power-n143861", "site_name": "NBC News", "image": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_26/537756/140629-karl-rove-240p_22f97e9df98402866c6454bb29a6282d.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Karl Rove said President Barack Obama is abusing his executive powers by failing to consult with Congress."}, "twitter": {"domain": "NBCNews.com", "description": "Karl Rove said President Barack Obama is abusing his executive powers by failing to consult with Congress.", "title": "Rove Calls Obama's Executive Actions 'Imperial Power' - NBC News", "image": {"src": "http://media3.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2014_26/537756/140629-karl-rove-240p_22f97e9df98402866c6454bb29a6282d.nbcnews-fp-1200-800.jpg"}, "creator": "NBCNews", "site": "NBCNews", "card": "summary"}, "blitz": "mu-e1e842c9-946002e6-ea8f0454-41b29546", "DC.date.issued": "2014-06-29", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=319740707, app-argument=http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/rove-calls-obamas-executive-actions-imperial-power-n143861", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613}, "google-site-verification": "K8bowvEbzWfPQ76x6f9SCxMVwicVXrhiClRg80ak8ZA", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/NBCNews"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Politics,White House"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdda3b\"", "article_summary": "@RepBecerra on Executive Overreach: President Obama is implementing the law, not re-writing it #FNS \u2014 FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) June 29, 2014\u2014 Elisha Fieldstadt\n@RepGoodlatte on Executive Overreach: We have the power to bring causes of action when we think he is trampling over the constitution #FNS \u2014 FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) June 29, 2014.\nKarl Rove on Sunday defended House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s decision to sue the Obama administration, comparing the president\u2019s use of executive powers to England's King George rule over the early American colonies.\nThe Constitution \"does not say the legislative power is shared between the president and the Congress.\"\nThis is some monarch to say I am the law,\" Rove said on Fox News Sunday."}
