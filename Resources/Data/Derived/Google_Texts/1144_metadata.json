As Benen points out, this isn't the first time they've used Obamacare to condemn anything they hate, or rather anything Obama does or supports: net neutrality, education reform, clean energy proposals, Wall Street reform.\n\nBut here's the thing that makes this all so much more insane: Obamacare is working!

They're stuck in 2010, where their cognitive dissonance is apparently going to keep them forever.\n\nIf the Iran agreement works as well as Obamacare, we're not going to be worrying so much about a nuclear Iran in the coming decades.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "Maybe they'll buy it.\n\nWhat must it be like inside the brain of a movement conservative?
