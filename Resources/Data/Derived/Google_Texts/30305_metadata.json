Well, except for the \u201cbest of times\u201d part \u2014 I just put that in because it\u2019s a literary reference, albeit one that gets used too often, and it has a nice rhythm to it. Still, it\u2019s important to recognize, at the end of a year full of racial discord, disturbing revelations about our own government, political paralysis and near-total inaction on the issues that really matter, that the American picture is contradictory and paradoxical, rather than flat-out negative.\n\nI don\u2019t think it makes any sense at this point in history, if it ever did, to talk about \u201cthe year in movies\u201d as if that could be divorced from any social or political context. Sure, some people are content to write year-end pieces from inside a self-referential bubble of empty symbolism, meaningless fluffery and puppet theater, devoid of any social meaning or relevance to ordinary people\u2019s lives. And those are the political reporters! I\u2019m here to talk about the serious stuff, like why Brad Pitt\u2019s abolitionist-Canadian carpenter character in \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d has such amazing hair (and doesn\u2019t sound anything like a Canadian). Answer: That question answers itself.\n\nI\u2019ve got Iron Man and Ted Cruz up there partly because it\u2019s a funny combination, but also because they were the big winners of 2013 and maybe, taking the longer view, its big losers too. They\u2019re a pair of sarcastic and charismatic assholes who are intelligent, vainglorious and badly in need of lessons in humility. It can be difficult to remember that, in the real world, Cruz is a junior member of the United States Senate, who is disliked by nearly all his colleagues and has almost no ability to get things done. He has branded himself almost overnight as the leader of a fervent, insurrectionist and newly energized right-wing movement, which claims it wants to save America from creeping socialism but seems suspiciously eager to destroy it instead. Cruz is surely one of the most loved, most hated and most feared men in America, but with the failure of the government shutdown, he is also almost certainly now past his apex of popularity. Barring an actual right-wing revolution, one involving bullets rather than ballots, Cruz will never be president, and will never be more powerful than he was this past summer and fall.\n\nRobert Downey Jr.\u2019s metal-clad superhero is also past his prime, but remains massively popular. I\u2019m not suggesting any profound ideological parallels between Ted Cruz and Iron Man, by the way, although we could get partway there: They\u2019re both ultimately defenders of power and privilege masked as other things, but at least Tony Stark does not pretend to stand for ordinary people. One could devote an entire article, or even a book, to decoding the incoherent politics of the Marvel universe (possibly someone has done this), which seem to teeter back and forth between post-1960s liberalism and full-on fascism.\n\nAt any rate, the \u201cIron Man\u201d franchise went out on top, with its final installment piling up more than $1.2 billion in worldwide box office, making it easily the year\u2019s top-grossing film. Yet \u201cIron Man 3\u201d was a hit movie and really nothing more. You never felt like it generated tremendous water-cooler buzz, or compelled Op-Ed columnists to weave it into their copy. (That role, in 2013, belonged to \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d) It would be stupid to suggest that the era of the superhero movie is over \u2014 not with Captain America and Spider-Man sequels coming next summer, and both Joss Whedon\u2019s next Avengers movie and Zack Snyder\u2019s \u201cBatman vs. Superman\u201d scheduled for 2015 \u2014 but I suspect it\u2019s entering a long, slow period of decline, a decadent slide into the sunset. Superhero movies will make tons of money into the indefinite future, but the genre as currently constructed seems to have run into its inherent limitations, and we no longer need to convince ourselves it possesses mythic significance. Recently, we learned the news that Paul Rudd may be playing Ant-Man in an upcoming Marvel picture. I rest my case.\n\nNo one who made a movie released in 2013 had ever heard of Edward Snowden or George Zimmerman when their projects were launched, but those two ambiguous figures hovered over the cultural realm as over the political. Mistrust of government, the ruling elites and all forms of authority has long been a potent theme in popular entertainment, and the entire saga of Snowden, Glenn Greenwald and Laura Poitras seemed ripped from a wonky (if excellent) thriller. In the movies, paranoia was almost ubiquitous this year: \u201cIron Man 3\u201d and \u201cStar Trek Into Darkness\u201d were driven by complicated conspiracy theories; \u201cGravity\u201d captured the aftermath of a technological apocalypse; cowardly politicians surrender the world to monsters in \u201cPacific Rim\u201d; a group of magicians stage class-warfare spectacles in the surprise summer hit \u201cNow You See Me.\u201d Most obvious of all, there was \u201cThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire,\u201d a girl-power action flick about the birth of a revolutionary underground. It will out-gross its predecessor, both because it\u2019s a better film and because it appeals to the disgruntled and disenfranchised across the political spectrum. Is Katniss Everdeen inspired by Lenin, by Emma Goldman or by Ayn Rand?
