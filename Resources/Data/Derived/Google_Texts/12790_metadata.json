At a recent event for a startup, he told Business Insider that he asked his staff to see what the companies providing him returns all had in common.\n\nThe answer? Every one of them was led by a woman.\n\nOf the more than two dozen companies in O\u2019Leary\u2019s diverse portfolio, just over half have female CEOs. Not all of them are profitable, he says, but among those that are, all are female-owned.\n\nSo what\u2019s the secret to their success? O\u2019Leary suspects it could be multitasking.\n\nWomen are sometimes considered better multitaskers than men, a skill important to startup and mid-level companies with annual sales of $5 million to $10 million.\n\nWomen take less risk, focus on goals and deliver on promises, O\u2019Leary said.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time the Canadian entrepreneur, author and TV personality has shouted the praises of women.\n\nEarlier this year, he told Entrepreneur that women make better CEOs and if given the choice between a woman and a man, all things being equal, he would choose the woman every time.\n\nNotably, the profitable, female-owned businesses in his portfolio aren\u2019t tied to a specific industry, he said.\n\nThey cross multiple sectors, including food, consumer goods, manufacturing and biotech. They have nothing to do with each other except have positive returns.\n\nAs an investor on the hit ABC series, O\u2019Leary said he has never looked at gender when evaluating the pitches. He focuses on the deal and whether he can make money.\n\nNow, however, given his findings, he might go back and look more closely at the trend over time.\n\nO\u2019Leary , 60, has been an investor on Shark Tank since it debuted in 2009.\n\nHe supposedly earned his nickname during that first season when he proposed a majority ownership in a music publishing business. Fellow investor Barbara Corcoran thought his idea was aggressive and said, \u201cWell aren\u2019t you Mr. Wonderful?\u2019\u2019 Since then, stories around the name have morphed, but his title has stuck.\n\nO\u2019Leary, who has led companies in the field of software (Softkey), education (The Learning Company) and storage (Storage Now), says his findings should encourage companies to elevate women to CEOs.\n\nSimply put, they make money and get the job done.\n\nGet Free Updates!
