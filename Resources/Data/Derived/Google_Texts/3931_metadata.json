The legislation was of paramount importance to the pro-life movement, and not only because it would have defunded the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider. Pro-lifers have also expressed concerns with ObamaCare for its contraception/abortifacient mandate and its funding of elective abortions.\n\nThat the legislation reached the President\u2019s desk at all is historic. Votes to defund both have occurred throughout Obama\u2019s two terms, but now, in his last year, both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate successfully passed the legislation for the first time. That historic move should not be underestimated.\n\nEven though it would take two-thirds of Congress to override President Obama\u2019s veto, this is a victory, because the majority of the people\u2019s elected representatives voted to defund Big Abortion.\n\nSpeaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) has stated that he will hold a vote later this month in an effort to override the President\u2019s veto, saying he intends to \u201ctak[e] this process all the way to the end under the Constitution.\u201d\n\nShould Congress be unable to override the veto, at least now we know that Congress can defund Planned Parenthood and repeal ObamaCare, because they have already voted to do so. It can be done again, and under a different President or a veto-proof vote by Congress, it can become the law of the land.\n\nPro-lifers can take comfort in knowing that a similar situation happened with the Partial Birth Abortion Ban, which was passed by Congress in 1995 and 1997 and was vetoed both times by President Bill Clinton. The legislation passed again in 2003, after Clinton left office, and was signed into law by his successor, President George W. Bush.\n\nIn light of this, pro-lifers should be both encouraged and energized for 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "That the legislation to defund Planned Parenthood reached the\u00a0President's desk at all is historic, and should not be underestimated.", "og": {"site_name": "Live Action News", "description": "That the legislation to defund Planned Parenthood reached the\u00a0President's desk at all is historic, and should not be underestimated.", "title": "Despite veto, Congress's defunding of Planned Parenthood is historic", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 700, "identifier": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/congress-night-e1431622793480.jpg", "height": 464}, "updated_time": "2016-01-12T13:28:49-04:00", "url": "http://liveactionnews.org/despite-veto-congress-defunding-planned-parenthood-historic/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "That the legislation to defund Planned Parenthood reached the\u00a0President's desk at all is historic, and should not be underestimated.", "title": "Despite veto, Congress's defunding of Planned Parenthood is historic", "image": "http://liveactionnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/congress-night-e1431622793480.jpg", "creator": "@liveactionnews", "site": "@liveactionnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.8", "fb": {"admins": 159900244, "pages": 49651563727}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/liveactionnewsonline", "published_time": "2016-01-12T14:51:33-04:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/rebecca.rose.downs", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2016-01-12T13:28:49-04:00", "tag": "Planned Parenthood"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "The legislation passed again in 2003, after Clinton left office, and was signed into law by his successor, President George W.
