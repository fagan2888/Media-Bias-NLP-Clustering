The notice said 79 employees would be affected by the plans.\n\nSandy McMahon, the group's practice manager, said employees may be able to secure jobs with the acquiring organization.\n\nEmployees have been notified of the company's plans, she said.\n\n\"We're hopeful they'll retain employment with the new group,\" McMahon said.\n\nSchenectady Regional Orthopedics has three offices, two in Schenectady and a third in Clifton Park.\n\nOrthoNY on Wednesday announced the planned April 14 opening of its ninth office in Glens Falls.\n\nMore Information\n\nWith that addition, the group will have offices in Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga and Warren counties. It does not have a presence in Schenectady County.\n\nAt the time OrthoNY was established, Chief Executive Alan Okun said payment changes coming with continued implementation of the Affordable Care Act spurred doctors to create a larger business.\n\nHealth providers expect to see a move from payments that cover each service to set rates \u2014 say, per patient per month \u2014 that require them to provide all services for one price. Such models favor larger medical practices that work closely with hospitals to avoid unnecessary or duplicative services.\n\nOrthoNY did not respond to inquiries about Schenectady Regional Orthopedics.\n\nThe medical practices provide sports medicine, foot and ankle surgery, hand surgery, joint surgery and general bone and joint care.\n\nchughes@timesunion.com \u2022 518-454-5417", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "The medical group would not disclose the name of the practice it hopes to join, but had been in touch with Ellis Medicine officials about discussions with OrthoNY, according to a spokesperson for Ellis.
