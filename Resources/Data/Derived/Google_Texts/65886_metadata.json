Michigan\u2019s right-to-work law took effect in 2013, and Wisconsin\u2019s in 2015.\n\nUnion officials insist right-to-work silences workers, reduces pay and increases the risk of death on the job. In truth, right-to-work laws simply stop unions from taking forced dues.\n\nWhere can we expect to see new protections of workers\u2019 freedom to choose whether to pay unions in the year to come?\n\nIn the Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association case before the U.S. Supreme Court, a group of California teachers are arguing against mandatory union fees for teachers and other government workers. The ruling could affect public employees across the country.\n\nIf the Court rules in favor of Rebecca Friedrichs and the other plaintiffs, millions of public employees in California and other states without right-to-work laws could gain the ability to choose whether to pay unions.\n\nOral arguments in the case are scheduled to begin Jan. 11. A decision is expected in June.\n\nWatchdog.org coverage of the Friedrichs case:\n\nRepublican lawmakers in West Virginia plan to introduce a right-to-work bill in January. West Virginia Senate President Bill Cole recently told Watchdog.org he has the votes to pass right-to-work and overcome a potential veto from Democratic Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin.\n\nIf right-to-work is approved in the West Virginia Senate and West Virginia House of Delegates, there could be 26 right-to-work states by March.\n\nKentucky Gov. Matt Bevin was elected in November by a wide margin after campaigning on a platform that included right-to-work. Democratic opponents of right-to-work in the Kentucky House may see the writing on the wall \u2014 or right-to-work may be advanced in 2017, depending on the outcome of House races next November.\n\nEven without a statewide law, local right-to-work ordinances being challenged in court by union officials could spread across Kentucky in 2016. And, if right-to-work proponents overcome the legal challenge, local right-to-work ordinances could become commonplace in other states.\n\nMissouri Gov. Jay Nixon is term-limited in 2016, and the race to succeed him looks like a toss-up. Nixon\u2019s veto was the only thing stopping right-to-work supporters in the Missouri General Assembly in 2015.\n\nPassage of right-to-work in West Virginia could prompt Missouri legislators to try again in 2016. The policy is likely to be hotly debated during the governor\u2019s race, and could move forward quickly in 2017 if a right-to-work supporter wins.", "article_metadata": {"description": "American workers are protected from mandatory labor union dues in 25 states, and the number is likely to increase in 2016.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "American workers are protected from mandatory labor union dues in 25 states, and the number is likely to increase in 2016.", "title": "Worker freedom fights to follow in 2016 - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/12/richard-trumka-aflcio-youtube-2013-convention.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-22T13:50:48+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/252431/worker-freedom-fights-2016/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "American workers are protected from mandatory labor union dues in 25 states, and the number is likely to increase in 2016.", "title": "Worker freedom fights to follow in 2016 - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/12/richard-trumka-aflcio-youtube-2013-convention.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "California", "tag": "Labor,right to work", "published_time": "2016-01-04T04:00:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-22T13:50:48+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "right to work, forced union dues, forced unionization, forced unionism, workplace freedom, west virginia right to work, kentucky right to work, missouri right to work, friedrichs v cta"}, "article_summary": "If right-to-work is approved in the West Virginia Senate and West Virginia House of Delegates, there could be 26 right-to-work states by March.\nPassage of right-to-work in West Virginia could prompt Missouri legislators to try again in 2016.\nWhere can we expect to see new protections of workers\u2019 freedom to choose whether to pay unions in the year to come?\nWatchdog.org coverage of the Friedrichs case:Republican lawmakers in West Virginia plan to introduce a right-to-work bill in January.\nAmerican workers are protected from mandatory labor union dues in 25 states, and the number is likely to increase in 2016."}
