We print the full questions and answer here:\n\n1.) Gov. Bush, your economic plan calls for 4% compound annual growth. We understand that arithmetically this pulls the country out of the doldrums and starts us on a road to recovery. But exactly HOW do you propose to do it\u2013what are your key building blocks to actually achieve this?\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIn order to achieve real, sustained 4% economic growth, we need to fix a few big things as a country: how we tax, how we spend, how we regulate, embracing the energy revolution in our midst, and repealing and replacing Obamacare. I have laid out detailed, sweeping, and specific plans on each of these issues that you can read at Jeb2016.com. The central premise is getting Washington D.C. off the backs of job creators and putting more money in the hands of working Americans and less in the hands of crony capitalists.\n\nThat means lower taxes across the board, eliminating special deals, a balanced budget amendment, cutting down the federal workforce, and repealing and reforming the Obama administration\u2019s tidal wave of regulations drowning our economy.\n\nWe also need to invest in American energy, which will create more high-wage jobs and lower energy prices for American families.\n\n2.) You pride yourself, quite rightly, in being a pragmatic conservative in action\u2013so much so that your nickname during your time as governor was \u201cVeto Corleone.\u201d What are some of the bills you would have vetoed during President Obama\u2019s term? Would you have vetoed last week\u2019s budget bill?\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pick where to start! I certainly would have vetoed the trillion-dollar \u201cstimulus\u201d spending bill, Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, and the countless bloated spending bills that have become a normal part of the Obama/Clinton agenda. As for the budget agreement, it was only necessary because of President Obama\u2019s utter failure to lead on taxes, spending, and entitlements. Only in Washington does every budget \u201cdeal\u201d lead to more spending. I have laid out a detailed, specific agenda to break Washington\u2019s gridlock and address the big problems our country faces\u2013which will make such last-minute, deadline-driven \u201cdeals\u201d unnecessary.\n\n3.) This week, U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman said the UK could not count on a bi-lateral trade deal with America if her people voted to leave the EU. This is sending a chilling warning to the \u201cBritish Exit\u201d camp. Do you support this effort by President Obama and would you as President enter into a bi-lateral trade deal with a United Kingdom that left the EU?\n\nThe United States needs a strong Europe, and we have a special relationship and historic bond with Great Britain. As I\u2019ve stressed in my conversations with British and European leaders, in light of growing dangers from Russia in the East and terrorism from North Africa and the Middle East, I believe a strong Trans-Atlantic alliance is as important as ever for U.S. national security.\n\nGreat Britain is a sovereign nation, and they must make this decision about their relationship with Europe on their own. The U.S. should not be putting a thumb on the scale and certainly shouldn\u2019t bully an ally. That said, as President, if Great Britain made that decision of course the U.S. would work with them on a trade agreement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Former Florida Governor and 2016 Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush connected with Breitbart News for an interview on taxes, \"pragmatic\" conservatism, and trade.
