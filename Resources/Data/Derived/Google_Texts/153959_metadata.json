Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) demanded that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) require opt-out opportunities before personal data can be collected by companies.\n\nSchumer said it\u2019s a \u201cprivacy nightmare\u201d that fitness tracking companies can collect and sell personal data without the consumers\u2019 consent or knowledge.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cPersonal fitness bracelets and the data they collect on your health, sleep, and location, should be just that \u2014 personal,\u201d Schumer said Sunday. \u201cThe fact that private health data \u2014 rich enough to identify the user\u2019s gait \u2014 is being gathered by applications like FitBit and can then be sold to third-parties without the user\u2019s consent is a true privacy nightmare.\u201d\n\nUsers of fitness tracking technology typically enter personal health information such as weight and blood pressure and then are advised on a workout routine. Schumer said there are currently no federal protections to prevent these developers from then selling that data to a third party without the wearer\u2019s consent.\n\nHe called on the FTC to require fitness device and app companies to give consumers the ability to opt out before their personal information is sold. Schumer said the data sales could lead to some consumers being discriminated against because of their health.\n\n\u201cIf companies of fitness devices have the ability to sell personal health data to insurers, employers and others, users should be alerted and given the opportunity to decline,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThe FTC should require fitness devices and app companies to adopt new privacy measures that will help conceal the identity of individuals and develop policies to protect consumer information in the event of a security breach.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Sen.
