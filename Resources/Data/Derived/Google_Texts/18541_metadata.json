The authors of the study, which was published in the Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, claim that the people who are more likely to exhibit these types of compulsive behaviors tend to be perfectionistic, neurotic personalities.\n\n\u201cChronic hair-pulling, skin-picking disorder and nail-biting and various other habits are known as body-focused repetitive behaviors,\u201d Kieron O\u2019Connor, a lead author of the study, said in the press release. \u201cAlthough these behaviors can induce important distress, they also seem to satisfy an urge and deliver some form of reward.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connor continued: \u201cWe believe that individuals with these repetitive behaviors may be perfectionistic, meaning that they are unable to relax and to perform tasks at a \u2018normal\u2019 pace. They are therefore prone to frustration, impatience, and dissatisfaction when they do not reach their goals. They also experience greater levels of boredom.\u201d\n\nIn the study, researchers analyzed 48 participants \u2014 half of whom experienced these compulsive behaviors, and half of whom didn\u2019t. The participants went to a clinical evaluator for a telephone screening interview and completed questionnaires that evaluated emotions like boredom, anger, guilt, irritability, and anxiety. Afterwards, participants were exposed to 4 situations that were meant to induce a certain feeling \u2014 from stress and relaxation, to frustration and boredom. For the stress-induced situation, participants watched a plane crash video; in the relaxation one, they watched waves on a beach. Participants in the \u201cfrustration\u201d situation were asked to complete a problem that was actually way more difficult than expected; and those in the \u201cboredom\u201d one were asked to sit alone in a room for 6 minutes.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, the researchers found that the participants who were more likely to partake in the compulsive behaviors ended up having an even greater urge to engage in them during the boredom and frustration parts of the experiment.\n\n\u201cThese results partially support our hypothesis in that participants were more likely to engage in body-focused repetitive behaviors when they felt bored, frustrated, and dissatisfied than when they felt relaxed,\u201d Sarah Roberts, an author of the study, said. \u201cMoreover, they do engage in these behaviors when they are under stress. This means that condition is not simply due to \u2018nervous\u2019 habits. The findings suggest that individuals suffering from body-focused repetitive behaviors could benefit from treatments designed to reduce frustration and boredom and to modify perfectionist beliefs.\u201d\n\nSource: Roberts S, O\u2019Connor K, Aardema F, B\u00e9langer. \u201cThe impact of emotions on body-Focused repetitive behaviors: Evidence from a non-treatment-seeking sample.\u201d Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "boredom, compulsive behavior", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Research shows that boredom and frustration are likely to lead to compulsive behaviors, like nail-biting and hair-pulling.", "title": "How Boredom And Anger Lead To Compulsive Behaviors", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nail-biting-boredom-away-psychological-factors-behind-compulsive-behaviors-325350", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/11/biting-nails.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Research shows that boredom and frustration are likely to lead to compulsive behaviors, like nail-biting and hair-pulling.", "title": "How Boredom And Anger Lead To Compulsive Behaviors", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/nail-biting-boredom-away-psychological-factors-behind-compulsive-behaviors-325350", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/11/biting-nails.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/11/biting-nails.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Under the Hood", "published_time": "2015-03-11T17:55:12-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-11T17:57:37-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Research shows that boredom and frustration are likely to lead to compulsive behaviors, like nail-biting and hair-pulling."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1524\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe impact of emotions on body-Focused repetitive behaviors: Evidence from a non-treatment-seeking sample.\u201d Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, 2015.\nIf you're in a stressful environment and you experience boredom or frustration, you may be more likely to channel that by engaging in compulsive behaviors like nail-biting.\n\u201cChronic hair-pulling, skin-picking disorder and nail-biting and various other habits are known as body-focused repetitive behaviors,\u201d Kieron O\u2019Connor, a lead author of the study, said in the press release.\nThey also experience greater levels of boredom.\u201dIn the study, researchers analyzed 48 participants \u2014 half of whom experienced these compulsive behaviors, and half of whom didn\u2019t.\nThe findings suggest that individuals suffering from body-focused repetitive behaviors could benefit from treatments designed to reduce frustration and boredom and to modify perfectionist beliefs.\u201dSource: Roberts S, O\u2019Connor K, Aardema F, B\u00e9langer."}
