The Denver-native mixed-martial arts fighter entered ranked No. 3 in the UFC\u2019s lightweight division.\n\nIn a measured, tactical bout, Cerrone earned two takedowns of Henderson (21-5). Cerrone also caught the Colorado Springs native with a high kick to the chin in the first round.\n\nHenderson kept Cerrone at a distance with repeated kicks to the thighs. \u201cI couldn\u2019t unload like I wanted to,\u201d Cerrone said in his in-ring interview.\n\nBut Cerrone eked out a 29-28 advantage on all three judge\u2019s cards.\n\nIn a post-fight interview, Cerrone said:\n\n\u201cThis is a hard victory for me to celebrate. This is tough. I could tell he was timid in there. I love the dude. We grew up together.\u201d\n\nHenderson seemed displeased in the ring with the judge\u2019s decisions giving Cerrone the win.\n\n\u201cThe first round was close, second round I took him down, but I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a judge,\u201d Cerrone said. \u201cThey say don\u2019t leave it to the judges because you don\u2019t know what fight they\u2019re watching. I went in there wild and crazy like I am. Five rounds with Ben is what we always need. We\u2019ll do it again.\u201d\n\nThe official scorecard for the fight:", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Benson Henderson,Donald", "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "og": {"site_name": "All Things Colorado Sports", "description": "Donald \"Cowboy\" Cerrone earned a unanimous but close decision over Benson Henderson at the UFC's Fight Night card in Boston.", "title": "Cowboy Cerrone edges Benson Henderson at UFC Fight Night", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2015/01/18/donald-cowboy-cerrone-edges-benson-henderson-tactical-ufc-fight-night-bout/27250/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2013/10/donald-cowboy-cerrone.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Donald \"Cowboy\" Cerrone earned a unanimous but close decision over Benson Henderson at the UFC's Fight Night card in Boston.", "title": "Donald \u201cCowboy\u201d Cerrone edges Benson Henderson in tactical UFC Fight Night bout", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/2015/01/18/donald-cowboy-cerrone-edges-benson-henderson-tactical-ufc-fight-night-bout/27250/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/sports/files/2013/10/donald-cowboy-cerrone.jpg", "creator": "@nickgroke", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "language": "en, sv", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Donald \"Cowboy\" Cerrone earned a unanimous but close decision over Benson Henderson at the UFC's Fight Night card in Boston."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2871\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThey say don\u2019t leave it to the judges because you don\u2019t know what fight they\u2019re watching.\n\u201cThe first round was close, second round I took him down, but I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a judge,\u201d Cerrone said.\nDonald \u201cCowboy\u201d Cerrone, fighting for the seventh time in 14 months and just 15 days after a victory in Las Vegas, earned a unanimous but close decision victory over Benson Henderson at the Ultimate Fighting Championship\u2019s Fight Night card in Boston on Sunday night.\nCerrone (27-7) won a seventh consecutive fight.\nHenderson kept Cerrone at a distance with repeated kicks to the thighs."}
