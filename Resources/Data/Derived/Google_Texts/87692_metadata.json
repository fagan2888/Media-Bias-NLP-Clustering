The plan also increases focus on fraud and abuse detection within Medicare Part D and drug reimbursement, FierceHealthPayer: AntiFraud previously reported.\n\nMost projects included in the plan build on previous plans, with several focusing specifically on outcomes and care quality, including:\n\nDeveloping an estimate for national rates of adverse and temporary harm events involving Medicare patients receiving post-acute care at rehabilitation centers\n\nDeveloping similar estimates of harm events in long-term care hospitals as well as contributing factors and associated costs\n\nAssessing hospitals' readiness for high-risk infectious diseases, in keeping with its previous analysis of threats such as pandemics and national disaster preparedness\n\n\"While the relative lack of new hospital-focused projects is interesting, it is also clear that the OIG will complete and publish a considerable number of reports concerning hospitals in 2016,\" Lord wrote in her analysis. \"Since the OIG's findings in these reports often furnish the bases for further government investigation, hospitals should prepare for, and expect, continuing scrutiny in these areas.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the work plan (.pdf)\n\n- here's the analysis (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nOIG's 2016 Work Plan targets Part D, med equipment fraud concerns\n\nHospitals focus on seniors to prevent readmissions, adverse events\n\nAs outpatient care gains steam, one Texas hospital adopts a short-stay model\n\nA potential weak link in patient safety: ER to inpatient handoffs\n\nMedical groups issue new geriatric ER guidelines\n\nGeriatric ER popularity grows to meet demand", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new federal\u00a0work plan\u00a0shows a growing shift in the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General priorities,\u00a0particularly with regard to hospitals.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "A new federal\u00a0work plan\u00a0shows a growing shift in the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General priorities,\u00a0particularly with regard to hospitals.", "title": "What the OIG's 2016 work plan means for hospitals", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/oigs-2016-plan-emphasizes-completion-existing-projects/2015-11-17", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "adverse events,alternative care models,Care Delivery,HHS office of inspector general,infectious dieases,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,value-based purchasing", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "A new federal work plan shows a growing shift in the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General (OIG) priorities, particularly with regard to hospitals.\nThe only new hospital projects announced in the work plan are payment-focused, including a review of Medicare payments to acute care hospitals and an analysis of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' validation of inpatient quality reporting data.\nThe plan also increases focus on fraud and abuse detection within Medicare Part D and drug reimbursement, FierceHealthPayer: AntiFraud previously reported.\n\"Since the OIG's findings in these reports often furnish the bases for further government investigation, hospitals should prepare for, and expect, continuing scrutiny in these areas.\"\nInstead of new hospital projects, the OIG will aim to complete in 2016 those already in progress, according to an analysis by Sara Lord, an attorney with the law firm Arnall Golden Gregory in Georgia, who used to work with the Department of Justice."}
