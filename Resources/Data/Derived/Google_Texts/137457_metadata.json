They were protesting against harsh conditions, including poor food, limited access to healthcare and harassment by guards.\n\n\u201cThis shows how wrong and how devastating this immigration system is,\u201d Mena said. \u201cPeople are willing to risk their lives to show exactly what is happening in these facilities.\u201d\n\nLike many of the more than 250 immigration detention centers in the country, Adelanto is administered by Geo Group, a Florida-based private contractor, as part of an agreement with ICE.\n\nThe US Congress has set a national quota mandating that ICE hold at least 34,000 immigrants in detention centers each day.\n\n\u201cProfit is being placed over people\u2019s lives,\u201d Mena said. \u201cThe US tells other countries how to handle refugees, but we are putting refugees in jail for undisclosed amounts of time while companies make a profit.\u201d\n\nStrikes spreading\n\nElsewhere, in the T Don Hutto detention center in southern Texas, a mass hunger strike that started more than two weeks ago peaked with an estimated 500 women, mostly asylum seekers, refusing to eat.\n\nThe women are now holding rolling hunger strikes in which 40 to 50 residents of each section of the detention centre take turns refusing food.\n\nMost of the hunger-striking detainees are from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, where female murder rates rank first, second, and seventh, respectively, in the world, according to UN figures.\n\nT Don Hutto\u2019s spokesperson has denied that a hunger strike is taking place.\n\nMeanwhile, ICE released a statement saying that it \u201ctakes the health, safety and welfare of those in our care very seriously, and we continue to monitor the situation\u201d.\n\nHowever, according to Cristina Parker, of Grassroots Leadership, an Austin-based group that campaigns against for-profit detention centers, ICE has been interrogating and monitoring hunger strikers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing this even though they deny the hunger strike is taking place,\u201d she told Al Jazeera.\n\nAt least six hunger strikers have been transferred from T Don Hutto since the strike started.\n\n\u201cThe women feel like the moves to other detention centers were definitely punitive. They were moved in the middle of the night without prior notification,\u201d said Parker.\n\nIn mid-October, 54 Southeast Asian asylum seekers held a week-long hunger strike in a detention centre in El Paso, Texas.\n\nIn Lasalle detention centre in Louisiana, 14 detainees held a two-week hunger strike in solidarity with the women in T Don Hutto.\n\nTexans United For Families, a coalition of immigrant rights groups, has released audio recordings of phone conversations with the women still on hunger strike in T Don Hutto.\n\n\u201cI cannot continue here because I spent two days in the ice box for punishment,\u201d one of the women says, referring to solitary confinement.", "article_metadata": {"description": "US Guards 'Taunt Hunger-Striking Asylum Seekers'", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "AUTHOR": "Al Jazeera", "og": {"site_name": "MintPress News", "description": "US Guards 'Taunt Hunger-Striking Asylum Seekers'", "title": "US Guards 'Taunt Hunger-Striking Asylum Seekers'", "url": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/us-guards-taunt-hunger-striking-asylum-seekers/211285/", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/9d32748b206a4d429000f15be124bc47_18.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-13T15:06:33-05:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "US Guards 'Taunt Hunger-Striking Asylum Seekers'", "creator": "@MintPressNews", "image": "http://www.mintpressnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/9d32748b206a4d429000f15be124bc47_18.jpg", "title": "US Guards 'Taunt Hunger-Striking Asylum Seekers'", "site": "@MintPressNews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"admins": 100003161352196}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MintpressNewsMPN", "section": "Daily Digest", "tag": "ice", "published_time": "2015-11-14T05:00:14-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-13T15:06:33-05:00"}}, "article_summary": "At least 26 asylum seekers are on hunger strike in the Adelanto facility, a for-profit detention center in southern California.\nIn mid-October, 54 Southeast Asian asylum seekers held a week-long hunger strike in a detention centre in El Paso, Texas.\nHundreds of immigrants, including asylum seekers, have participated in the hunger strikes in California, Texas and Louisiana.\nUS Guards \u2018Taunt Hunger-Striking Asylum Seekers\u2019\"There has been a lot of intimidation and threats against the hunger strikers to reduce [their] numbers,\"A series of mass hunger strikes have rocked for-profit detention centers across the US, as rights groups call for asylum seekers to be released while their cases are pending.\nofficial MintPress sponsor official MintPress sponsorThey are all that remain of an original 90 hunger strikers who launched the collective fast on November 4."}
