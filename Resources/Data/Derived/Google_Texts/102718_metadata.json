Bromley also coached Meeks with the Bay Area Hurricanes, Bromley\u2019s Amateur Athletic Union team.\n\nHe confirmed Meeks\u2019 death Saturday afternoon but said doctors could not provide answers about what killed Meeks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not 100 percent sure, but he collapsed at practice and he was not responsive,\u201d Bromley said. \u201cHe was on a ventilator, his heart shut down, his lungs shut down and his fever spiked.\u201d\n\nBromley said he spent the night at Brandon Regional Hospital with Meeks and his family. Bromley said the hospital waiting room overflowed with Armwood and Brandon players.\n\nSteve Hegarty, spokesman for the Hillsborough County School District, said Brandon High School Principal Carl Green will help students and staff deal with Meeks\u2019 death.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts and prayers go out to the family,\u201d Hegarty said.\n\nA 6-foot-2-inch, 170-pound forward, Meeks played junior varsity basketball at Armwood his freshman and sophomore years. On the varsity team last season he played in 15 games and scored 34 total points.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s one of those guys who made it look easy,\u201d said Armwood head basketball Coach Jeff PaFunda. \u201cHe played big. He had long arms. He had a size 17 shoe. We thought he was going to be 7 feet tall.\u201d\n\nThose huge shoes earned Meeks the nickname \u201cFeet,\u201d said Marcus Hill, Meeks\u2019 former teammate at Armwood and now a freshman at the University of West Florida in Pensacola.\n\n\u201cHis life was basically about basketball,\u201d said Hill of Meeks. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do social media. He wasn\u2019t on Facebook or Twitter. He didn\u2019t go to parties. He just went to school and played basketball.\u201d\n\nPaFunda said Meeks had asthma symptoms, but passed every physical to play basketball.\n\nSeeing Meeks in the hospital connected to monitors and machines was shocking, PaFunda said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a bad dream,\u201d Bromley said. \u201cHe had his whole life ahead of him.\u201d\n\nMeeks\u2019 friends took to Twitter to mourn his death and celebrate his life.\n\nCameron Perkins, a senior at Sickles High School in Citrus Park, played with Meeks for three years on the Tampa Vision AAU team.\n\n\u201cIn practice, he worked hard,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t one of those players the coach had to worry about.\u201d\n\nPerkins said he heard about Meeks\u2019 illness and death from former teammates.\n\nPerkins said he and Meeks stayed in touch despite going to high schools on opposite sides of Hillsborough County.\n\n\u201cOff the court, he was a real funny guy,\u201d Perkins said. Meeks liked to sing R&B tunes, he said.\n\nThis year, they were looking forward to stepping into leadership roles on their teams, Perkins said.\n\n\u201cBoth of us had a lot of seniors in front of us, so we didn\u2019t get a lot of playing time last year,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cThis was supposed to be a pretty big year for us.\u201d\n\nMeeks is the most recent Hillsborough high school player to collapse during practice drills.\n\nIn 2009, Wharton High School basketball player Drake Williams, then 16, collapsed during practice. He was resuscitated by Tampa Fire Rescue paramedics who happened to be at the school for a fundraiser football game.\n\nAt the time, doctors said Williams suffered sudden cardiac death when his heart stopped beating. Doctors fitted Williams with an internal defibrillator.\n\nIn 2007, Chamberlain High basketball coach Doug Aplin used CPR and a portable defibrillator to resuscitate 17-year-old Kenneth Brooks after he collapsed during basketball practice.\n\nEmail: nwilliams@tampatrib.com\n\nTwitter: @NickWilliamsTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 21 Sep 2013 17:39:09 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 A Brandon High School senior died Saturday, one day after conditioning with the basketball team during a pre-season workout.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 A Brandon High School senior died Saturday, one day after conditioning with the basketball team during a pre-season workout.", "title": "Brandon athlete dies after collapsing at practice", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/sports/preps/brandon-prep-basketball-player-dies-after-collapsing-at-practice-20130921/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20130921/ARTICLE/130929781/AR/0/AR-130929781.jpg", "height": 556}, "updated_time": "2013-09-22T14:00:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 A Brandon High School senior died Saturday, one day after conditioning with the basketball team during a pre-season workout.", "title": "Brandon athlete dies after collapsing at practice", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20130921/ARTICLE/130929781/AR/0/AR-130929781.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "googlebot-news": "noindex", "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2013-09-21T17:39:09Z-04", "modified_time": "2013-09-22T14:00:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8cdd\"", "article_summary": "TAMPA \u2014 A Brandon High School senior died Saturday, one day after conditioning with the basketball team during a pre-season workout.\nIn 2009, Wharton High School basketball player Drake Williams, then 16, collapsed during practice.\nIn 2007, Chamberlain High basketball coach Doug Aplin used CPR and a portable defibrillator to resuscitate 17-year-old Kenneth Brooks after he collapsed during basketball practice.\nSteve Hegarty, spokesman for the Hillsborough County School District, said Brandon High School Principal Carl Green will help students and staff deal with Meeks\u2019 death.\nMilo Meeks, 18, had transferred to Brandon this year after playing basketball for three years at Armwood High School in Seffner."}
