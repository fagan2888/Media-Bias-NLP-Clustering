Bush and his foundation have served as champions for the Common Core standards reform.\n\nAFC sponsored a conference in May, as well, keynoted by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2013also in attendance at the New Hampshire education summit. During his address in May, Walker came out in full support for school vouchers, claiming them to be a \u201cmoral and economic imperative.\u201d\n\nBrown herself is a supporter of the Common Core, as well as school choice. In a recent interview with Breitbart News, she said one of the primary ways the American education system has failed is in \u201cinstitutional inequality.\u201d\n\nThe founder of the Partnership for Educational Justice, Brown said, \u201cParental choice in this country is only available to people who have resources. And so there\u2019s inherent discrimination in the system.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a position because I\u2019ve been lucky in my life, because I get to choose where my kids go to school. \u2026 I can afford to send them there,\u201d she said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not the case for most people. And sadly, the education we get is largely defined by our zip code and the neighborhood we live in.\u201d\n\nIn most states, children are now returning to school to education standards called \u201cCommon Core,\u201d a label that former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee referred to as \u201ctoxic,\u201d and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush just recently termed \u201cpoisonous.\u201d\n\nIn addition, former Bush administration education senior policy adviser Ze\u2019ev Wurman wrote recently that Common Core is \u201cdead,\u201d while Cato Institute\u2019s Neal McCluskey, in reviewing new poll numbers, described the education reform as \u201ccrashing.\u201d\n\nNot to be outdone, the Boston Globe acknowledged last month that the federally funded Common Core test consortium known as PARCC is in a \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d\n\nThough these are ominous descriptors of the name of the academic initiative awaiting America\u2019s children in their classrooms, it is true that GOP presidential contenders are running for their political lives from Common Core.\n\nThe newly published 2015 Education Next poll shows support for Common Core continuing its decline, down to 49% of the public. Among Republicans, however, support has plummeted to 37%, a rather threatening figure to Republican candidates who have been staunch supporters of the reform.\n\nBush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, both avid champions of Common Core\u2013and somewhat cranky toward those who oppose the reform\u2013continued their support at the forum, though Bush seemed to distance himself, perhaps still sensing their \u201cpoisonous\u201d grip on his candidacy.\n\n\u201cIf people don\u2019t like Common Core, fine,\u201d Bush said. \u201cJust make sure your standards are much higher than the ones you had before. We can\u2019t keep dumbing down standards.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s warning accentuates his persistent failure to acknowledge the reason why Common Core is not acceptable to the conservative base of the Republican Party. The Constitution provides states with oversight of education, not the federal government. No state is required by the Constitution to have standards \u201cmuch higher than the ones you had before.\u201d Consequently, if states do not pursue high education standards on their own\u2013sad as it may be\u2013it is their right to do so.\n\nBush\u2019s statement also suggests he believes the Common Core standards are \u201chigher\u201d than others, though no independent studies have demonstrated that claim. In fact, the independent studies that have been done suggest the claim is invalid.\n\nKasich continued his open support for Common Core at the forum, emphasizing its primary purpose of providing the same opportunities across the country for all children.\n\n\u201cWe should have high standards,\u201d he said, indicating also that curriculum should be decided locally, a feat that is not likely to be accomplished if students must take standardized tests aligned to the Common Core standards. Teachers cannot teach a \u201clocal\u201d curriculum when their students are being tested on the nationalized Common Core standards.\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Bush and Kasich have earned a grade of \u201cF\u201d on the newly released \u201cCommon Core Report Card\u201d published Wednesday at The Pulse 2016 by conservative groups American Principles in Action and Cornerstone Policy Research.\n\nRepublican candidate Carly Fiorina, however, took a different approach at the forum, pointing out the U.S. Department of Education has continued to receive more taxpayer funds each year for several decades\u2013supposedly to address the achievement gap\u2013with little to show for it.\n\nRegarding Common Core, Fiorina said, \u201cWhat it\u2019s turned into is a program that is being overly influenced by companies that have something to gain\u2013testing companies, textbook companies.\u201d\n\nFiorina earned a grade of C+ on the Common Core Report Card.\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal flipped his view of Common Core and has largely attempted to fight against the initiative in his state over the past year, even to the extent of taking the Obama administration to court.\n\nComparing Common Core to Obamacare, he said, \u201cI liked the concept\u201d of what he was told Common Core would be, though it did not turn out in that way. \u201cPhilosophically, I\u2019ve never believed in a federal government role\u201d in curriculum, he said, and added that he felt decisions should be made at a local level.\n\nJindal earned a grade of B+ on the Common Core Report Card.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker again promoted school choice during the education forum, and observed the barriers to good education presented by teachers\u2019 unions as he highlighted his fight against the unions in his state.\n\nThough Walker defunded the Common Core-aligned Smarter Balanced test in his state, it was replaced by another Common Core-aligned test, an action that does not encourage Wisconsin school districts to actually choose their own \u201clocal\u201d standards since their students will be judged on a Common Core test.\n\n\u201cI want high standards,\u201d said Walker, who earned a grade of D+ on the Common Core Report Card. \u201cI just want them set by people at the local level.\u201d\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2013who has only recently considered abandoning Common Core in his state, said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work. I tried four years of Common Core in New Jersey.\u201d\n\nChristie, who also earned a grade of D+ on the Common Core Report Card, said he fought against Common Core opponents for four years, as well. \u201cWhen something doesn\u2019t work that we try, we have to change it.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Six Republican presidential hopefuls met Wednesday in New Hampshire to discuss education, including the Common Core standards initiative.", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Six Republican presidential hopefuls met Wednesday in New Hampshire to discuss education, including the Common Core standards initiative.", "title": "Common Core Hot Topic at New Hampshire Education Summit", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/NH-GOP-Education-Summit-Kasich-ap.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/08/20/common-core-hot-topic-at-gop-new-hampshire-education-summit/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Six Republican presidential hopefuls met Wednesday in New Hampshire to discuss education, including the Common Core standards initiative.", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/08/NH-GOP-Education-Summit-Kasich-ap.jpg", "title": "Common Core Hot Topic at New Hampshire Education Summit", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Bobby Jindal 2016, Campbell Brown, Carly Fiorina 2016, Chris Christie 2016, Common Core, Common Core rebrand, Common Core Report Card, Common Core tests, Education Next, Jeb Bush 2016, John Kasich 2016, New Hampshire 2016 presidential primary, Scott Walker 2016, The Pulse 2016, The Seventy Four, Ze'ev Wurman,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Education,New Hampshire Education Summit", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Ze'ev Wurman", "published_time": "2015-08-20T09:07:15-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Education"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "I tried four years of Common Core in New Jersey.\u201dChristie, who also earned a grade of D+ on the Common Core Report Card, said he fought against Common Core opponents for four years, as well.\nComparing Common Core to Obamacare, he said, \u201cI liked the concept\u201d of what he was told Common Core would be, though it did not turn out in that way.\nRegarding Common Core, Fiorina said, \u201cWhat it\u2019s turned into is a program that is being overly influenced by companies that have something to gain\u2013testing companies, textbook companies.\u201dFiorina earned a grade of C+ on the Common Core Report Card.\nTeachers cannot teach a \u201clocal\u201d curriculum when their students are being tested on the nationalized Common Core standards.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSix Republican presidential contenders met Wednesday at the New Hampshire Education Summit in the early-voting state to discuss education issues, including the hotly debated Common Core standards initiative."}
