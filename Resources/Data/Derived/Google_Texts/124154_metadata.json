Forty-three states posted double-digit declines.\n\nCoreLogic Chief Economist Frank Nothaft attributed the increased delinquency rate in those states to the price declines for the fuels they produce. As of Tuesday, the price of crude oil had dropped more than 19 percent year over year. The price of coal is down more than 10 percent over the same time period.\n\nRelated: 14 States With the Hottest Housing Markets Heading Into Spring\n\nNationwide, however, Nothaft said that gains in home prices and incomes have helped stabilize the housing market. \u201cLonger term, we anticipate a better balance of supply with demand in many markets which will help sustain healthy and affordable home values into the future,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nNationally, the level of serious delinquency fell nearly 20 percent to its lowest level in eight years. Foreclosure inventory, the number of homes at some stage of the foreclosure process, fell nearly 24 percent year-over-year. The number of completed foreclosures dropped 10 percent in the same period.\n\nThere were 38,000 completed foreclosures in February, down more than 71 percent from its peak of 118,000 in September 2010. There have been more than 8 million homes lost to foreclosure since homeownership rates peaked in 2004.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "While the rate of homeowners falling behind on their mortgages is falling nationwide,", "title": "The Crash in Fuel Prices Is Hurting Homeowners in These Two States", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/12/How-Oil-Crash-Crushing-Homeowners-These-Two-States", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06062012_Oil_Well_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/12/How-Oil-Crash-Crushing-Homeowners-These-Two-States", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06062012_Oil_Well_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "While the rate of homeowners falling behind on their mortgages is falling nationwide,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "CoreLogic Chief Economist Frank Nothaft attributed the increased delinquency rate in those states to the price declines for the fuels they produce.\nWhile the rate of homeowners falling behind on their mortgages is falling nationwide, it\u2019s ticking up in two states with economies closely tied to the price of oil and coal.\nForeclosure inventory, the number of homes at some stage of the foreclosure process, fell nearly 24 percent year-over-year.\nRelated: 14 States With the Hottest Housing Markets Heading Into SpringNationwide, however, Nothaft said that gains in home prices and incomes have helped stabilize the housing market.\nThere were 38,000 completed foreclosures in February, down more than 71 percent from its peak of 118,000 in September 2010."}
