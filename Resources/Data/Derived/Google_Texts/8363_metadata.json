A second would change testing requirements imposed by an earlier legislature. Another would prevent the state from sharing education data with federal statisticians. Similar bite-sized measures are likely to appear elsewhere.\n\n\u201cMost of this legislation is being broken up,\u201d said Noah Wall, director of grassroots at the conservative FreedomWorks, which opposes Common Core. \u201cThere\u2019s been a tremendous amount of movement that we\u2019ve seen in a number of states.\u201d\n\nLegislators and governors in 46 states, plus the District of Columbia, initially adopted the Common Core standards. In the past year, Indiana, Oklahoma and South Carolina have dropped out of the national standards.\n\nThe education standards, initially a product of the bipartisan National Governors Association that was then embraced by the Obama administration, have split Republicans outside the Beltway. There are few issues \u2014 perhaps even including the Affordable Care Act \u2014 that angers the conservative base as much as Common Core, which most Republican governors still support.\n\n\u201cIt has divided the party. You\u2019ve got [former Florida governor] Jeb Bush and [former education secretary] Bill Bennett on one side supporting Common Core, good conservative Republicans, and you\u2019ve got [Louisiana Gov.] Bobby Jindal and others on the other side saying this is the devil\u2019s spawn,\u201d Utah Gov. Gary Herbert (R), a Common Core backer, said in an interview. \u201cIf there\u2019s ever been a program that\u2019s been more poorly rolled out than Obamacare, which didn\u2019t have a very illustrious beginning, it\u2019s Common Core.\u201d\n\nThe vast majority of school superintendents \u2014 about nine out of 10 surveyed by the pro-Common Core Center for Education Policy in a recent poll \u2014 say the standards are more rigorous than their earlier ones. Three quarters said they expect student skills to improve under the new regime.\n\nBut Herbert says he routinely hears from Common Core opponents who believe the program is an effort to make money for Bill Gates, the Microsoft co-founder whose foundation is supporting the higher education standards.\n\n\u201cIs this the guy who\u2019s worth $60 billion you\u2019re talking about?\u201d Herbert said he asks the activists.\n\nNonetheless, Herbert is one of the governors who will be playing defense on Common Core this year. Conservatives in the Utah legislature, and in states like Ohio, Tennessee, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Georgia and Maine, are likely to try to repeal all or part of the standards. Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval (R) and Wyoming Gov. Matt Mead (R) both said they expect to see conservatives try their own repeal bills.\n\nRepublicans who support the tougher standards have been taken aback by the response from conservatives both nationally and in their own states. Some have attempted to rebrand the standards to escape the stigma of a national education program: Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R) stripped the words \u201cCommon Core\u201d from her state\u2019s education standards. Iowa renamed the program the \u201cIowa Core,\u201d though the standards remain identical.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s Common Core, Wyoming Core, Rocky Mountain Core or Idaho-Wyoming Core, when we think about the republic, when we think about our country, when we think about our workforce, it\u2019s not acceptable to me to say that we\u2019re going to accept middle-of-the-road in terms of education,\u201d Mead said. \u201cThe idea of high standards is universally accepted. It\u2019s how do we do it.\u201d\n\nEven supporters have bowed to pressure from Common Core opponents. Herbert said there is legitimate concern about sharing education data with the federal government; Utah will take steps to protect student privacy and data, he said.\n\nWall said establishment Republicans who have defended Common Core standards are trying to avoid debate. In Utah, Herbert ordered a review of Common Core standards, which was conducted by the state attorney general. That, Wall said, allowed heat from the debate to dissipate.\n\n\u201cA lot of state House Speakers and governors have more been trying to sweep it under the rug, to avoid discussion of Common Core,\u201d he said.\n\nElsewhere, Republicans who back the program are taking a more active role. Idaho Gov. Butch Otter (R) has brought both Bush and Bennett to his state to help educate legislators on the importance of Common Core. He also touts a letter from Education Secretary Arne Duncan, in which Duncan said the Education Department was not involved in crafting the standards.\n\nThere have been electoral consequences for Republicans who back the standards. In Arizona, former Peoria school board member Diane Douglas (R) ousted incumbent state Education Secretary John Huppenthal (R) in the Republican primary. Douglas narrowly defeated the pro-Common Core Democratic nominee, David Garcia, in November.\n\nOklahoma Superintendent of Public Instruction Janet Barresi (R), who spent more than $1 million of her own money seeking re-election, lost her job to former state Board of Education member Joy Hofmeister (R), in a race that revolved around Barresi\u2019s support for Common Core.\n\nThe debate is likely to play a role in the race for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, too. Jindal, who said as recently as 2012 that Common Core would \u201craise expectations for every child,\u201d now calls the standards an example of \u201cbig government.\u201d Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (R) has gone from favoring another look at Common Core standards to backing outright repeal.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Legislators in dozens of states plan new assaults on Common Core education standards in legislative sessions next year.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Legislators in dozens of states plan new assaults on Common Core education standards in legislative sessions next year.", "title": "Fresh attacks on Common Core ahead after GOP wave", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/12/17/fresh-attacks-on-common-core-ahead-after-gop-wave/", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/12/16/Style/Images/AP337906304033.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@postreid"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/govbeat/wp/2014/12/17/fresh-attacks-on-common-core-ahead-after-gop-wave/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "states, common core, education, Jeb Bush, Bobby Jindal, 2016, Republicans", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/reidhwilson"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "states, common core, education, Jeb Bush, Bobby Jindal, 2016, Republicans"}, "article_summary": "Bush urged politicians to make the case to their constituents in favor of Common Core education standards.\nWall said establishment Republicans who have defended Common Core standards are trying to avoid debate.\n\u201cMost of this legislation is being broken up,\u201d said Noah Wall, director of grassroots at the conservative FreedomWorks, which opposes Common Core.\nScott Walker (R) has gone from favoring another look at Common Core standards to backing outright repeal.\nIt\u2019s how do we do it.\u201dEven supporters have bowed to pressure from Common Core opponents."}
