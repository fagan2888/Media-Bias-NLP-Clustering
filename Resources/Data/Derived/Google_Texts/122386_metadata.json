The court.\n\nJohn Whitehead, a lawyer for the Rutherford Institute, confirmed on Thursday that it will be the lawyers on the Supreme Court bench who will get to decide whether an American citizen has First Amendment speech rights at the court.\n\nRight now, he doesn\u2019t.\n\nAnd Whitehead said the prognosis for changing that isn\u2019t great.\n\n\u201cThrough a series of carefully crafted legislative steps and politically expedient court rulings, government officials have managed to disembowel this fundamental freedom, rendering the First Amendment with little more meaning than the right to file a lawsuit against government officials,\u201d said Whitehead, a constitutional attorney.\n\n\u201cIronically, when we appeal this case, it will be the justices of the U.S. Supreme Court who will eventually be asked to decide the constitutionality of their own statute, yet they have already made their views on the subject quite clear.\u201d\n\nAt issue is the case of a man who was arrested for holding a sign in front of the court, on the public plaza there, where lawyers hold news conferences and there even have been some demonstrations.\n\n\n\nTrust the government? Maybe you shouldn\u2019t. Read the details in \u201cLies the Government Told You,\u201d by Judge Andrew Napolitano.\n\nBut the fact is such things are banned by administrative rule from the Supreme Court, and they are only allowed sometimes.\n\nHarold Hodge wasn\u2019t a recipient of such a right.\n\nOn Jan. 28, 2011, he was holding a three-foot by two-foot sign stating, \u201cThe U.S. Gov. Allows Police To Illegally Murder And Brutalize African Americans And Hispanic People.\u201d\n\nRutherford has argued the speech on the plaza, a place where the public is allowed to gather and converse and is in all relevant respects like a public square or park where citizens have traditionally met to express their views on matters of public interest, should be allowed.\n\nHodge, however, was handcuffed and arrested. He was accused of violating a law that makes it \u201cunlawful to display any flag, banner, or device designed to bring into public notice a party, organization, or movement while on the grounds of the U.S. Supreme Court.\u201d\n\nA U.S. district court judge struck the rule as clearly unconstitutional, but at the appellate level, it was reinstated.\n\nOn Thursday, Whitehead confirmed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia denied \u201cwithout explanation\u201d a petition for rehearing.\n\nThe request had been submitted because the decision that was released \u201cconflicts with earlier decisions construing a nearly identical statute.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf citizens cannot stand out in the open and voice their disapproval of their government, its representatives and its policies without fearing prosecution, then the First Amendment is little more than window-dressing on a store window \u2013 pretty to look at but serving little real purpose,\u201d said Whitehead.\n\nFor 60 years, the Supreme Court has had a rule \u201ccriminalizing expressive First Amendment activity on the Supreme Court plaza,\u201d the institute explained.\n\nWND has reported as the case progressed, including the earlier three-judge decision. And the ruling from the trial court that the ban was unconstitutional.\n\n\u201cIn response, the government not only appealed that ruling, but the marshal for the Supreme Court \u2013 with the approval of Chief Justice John Roberts \u2013 issued even more strident regulations outlawing expressive activity on the grounds of the high court, including the plaza,\u201d Rutherford reported.\n\nRutherford Institute attorneys have since filed a related lawsuit challenging the later orders.\n\nThe judges at the appeals court conceded that attorneys and litigants are allowed to use the plaza for public events such as news conferences and for \u201ccommercial or professional films relating to the court\u201d but said the government still can exclude those it does not want to have access to the forum.\n\nFor example, it noted 200 demonstrators surged up onto the plaza to protest a Missouri grand jury\u2019s decision not to indict a police officer who fatally shot a teenager in 2014.\n\nThe demonstration went on for 15 minutes, but no arrests were made.\n\nU.S. District Judge Beryl Howell originally found: \u201cThe absolute prohibition of expressive activity in the statute is unreasonable, substantially overbroad, and irreconcilable with the First Amendment. The court therefore must find the statute unconstitutional and void as applied to the Supreme Court plaza.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Who do you think gets to decide a fight over the First Amendment\u2019s speech protections when it\u2019s a court doing the restricting.
