Now a new report claims that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has allowed the use of such \u201chigh risk\u201d antibiotics in livestock feed, even though research has shown that these drugs could be harmful to humans in the long run by exposing them to antibiotic-resistant bacteria through food.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2010, the FDA tested some 30 antibiotics that have been used in animal feed and ranked them based on their level of risk to human health. Eighteen of these additives were considered \u201chigh risk,\u201d according to information obtained by the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the health and environmental advocacy group that released the report. Though the FDA found that these antibiotics used in livestock feed were in fact dangerous, they continued to allow their use, the NRDC stated.\n\n\u201c[The FDA is] not meeting their responsibility to protect public health,\u201d Avinash Kar, an NRDC lawyer, told The Washington Post. \u201cThey need to be doing better.\u201d According to the report, some 26 feed additives did not meet FDA standards that required companies to prove antibiotics being used for \u201cnontherapeutic use\u201d were safe through scientific studies. Nontherapeutic use refers to antibiotics that are used to promote growth or prevent diseases in livestock and poultry. The FDA\u2019s lack of regulation for such additives is \u201ca breach of their responsibility and the public trust,\u201d Carmen Cordova, an NRDC microbiologist and lead author of the report, told the Washington Post.\n\nThe report is yet another addition to the growing concern of antibiotic resistance, a public health issue that causes about 23,000 deaths per year. Due to frequent use and abuse of antibiotics \u2014 as well as the fact that these drugs are used in animals \u2014 bacteria are more likely to develop resistance to them, gradually rendering these drugs ineffective. A simple infection that could once be treated quickly and thoroughly with antibiotics may now become a potentially a life-threatening problem.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the FDA\u2019s failure to act on its own findings about the 30 reviewed antibiotic feed additives is part of a larger pattern of delay and inaction in tackling livestock drug use that goes back four decades,\u201d the authors of the report wrote. In the report, they suggest the next steps the FDA ought to take in order to begin remedying the situation: first, to \u201ccomplete the decades-delayed process\u201d for removing penicillin and tetracyclines in animal feed and limiting their use in sick animals; secondly, to withdraw approval for all other \u201cmedically important\u201d antibiotics that have been used for nontherapeutic reasons \u2014 if they have not been shown to be safe.\n\nReports have shown that 80 percent of antibiotics in the U.S. are used for farm animals rather than humans, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recently released warnings about the possibility for a major public health problem. A CDC report published last year, Antibiotic resistance threats in the United States, 2013, reviewed the threats of antibiotic resistance, noting that 2 million people become infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria per year.\n\n\"Resistant bacteria can contaminate the foods that come from those animals, and people who consume these foods can develop antibiotic-resistant infections,\" the CDC report said. \"The use of antibiotics for promoting growth is not necessary, and the practice should be phased out.\"\n\nLast year, the FDA did make moves to begin to rule out antibiotics use in cows, pigs, and chickens. \"In December 2013, the FDA began formal implementation of a strategy to phase out the use of all medically important antimicrobials,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The FDA is confident that its current strategy to protect the effectiveness of medically important antimicrobials, including penicillins and tetracyclines, is the most efficient and effective way to change the use of these products in animal agriculture.\" But Kar and the NRDC believes the the federal agency still has quite a way to go.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "antibiotics, fda, high risk antibiotics, farm animals, antibiotic resistant bacteria", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A new report by an environmental action group claims that the FDA has continued to allow antibiotic use in farm animals, though it may pose a health risk in humans.", "title": "FDA Allowed \u2018High Risk\u2019 Antibiotics To Be Used In Farm Animals", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-allowed-high-risk-antibiotics-be-used-farm-animals-despite-danger-humans-268079", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/28/cows.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new report by an environmental action group claims that the FDA has continued to allow antibiotic use in farm animals, though it may pose a health risk in humans.", "title": "FDA Allowed \u2018High Risk\u2019 Antibiotics To Be Used In Farm Animals", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/fda-allowed-high-risk-antibiotics-be-used-farm-animals-despite-danger-humans-268079", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/28/cows.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/01/28/cows.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2014-01-28T16:23:18-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-28T16:23:17-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A new report by an environmental action group claims that the FDA has continued to allow antibiotic use in farm animals, though it may pose a health risk in humans."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89b8\"", "article_summary": "Though the FDA found that these antibiotics used in livestock feed were in fact dangerous, they continued to allow their use, the NRDC stated.\n\u201c[The FDA is] not meeting their responsibility to protect public health,\u201d Avinash Kar, an NRDC lawyer, told The Washington Post.\nBacteria that develop immunity, or resistance to, antibiotics are growing in number, and have become a looming health threat.\nBetween 2001 and 2010, the FDA tested some 30 antibiotics that have been used in animal feed and ranked them based on their level of risk to human health.\nNontherapeutic use refers to antibiotics that are used to promote growth or prevent diseases in livestock and poultry."}
