On Tuesday, incumbent Democrat Sen. Mark Begich officially lost to his GOP challenger Dan Sullivan, giving Republicans their eighth Senate pickup in the 2014 midterms.\n\nBegich had a lot of factors working against him in the Last Frontier. Alaskans were not happy with President Obama and therefore not impressed with Begich\u2019s tendency to vote with him.\n\nBegich\u2019s gaffes also didn\u2019t help. He managed to offend a female Republican Senator with sexist comments and then offered this lie during a debate with Sullivan.\n\nThe GOP has one more chance to extend their lead in the Senate in the Louisiana Senate runoff election on December 6, where Bill Cassidy is expected to beat Sen.
