It would have offered realignment based on recent finishes.\n\nInstead, the powers that be created what amounts to two SECs (the Centennial and Jefferson County leagues) and extended the competitive gap.\n\nHere are the leagues:\n\nCentennial \u2014 Eaglecrest, Cherokee Trail, Cherry Creek, Grandview, Overland and Valor Christian.\n\nContinental North \u2014 Fruita Monument, Highlands Ranch, Mountain Vista, Regis Jesuit, Rock Canyon and ThunderRidge.\n\nContinental South \u2014 Castle View, Chaparral, Doherty, Douglas County, Fountain-Fort Carson, Legend.\n\nFlatirons \u2014 Boulder, Brighton, Denver East, Montbello, Northglenn, Prairie View, Thornton and Westminster.\n\nFront Range \u2014 Fairview, Fossil Ridge, Horizon, Legacy, Monarch, Mountain Range, Poudre and Rocky Mountain .\n\nJefferson County \u2014 Arvada West, Bear Creek, Chatfield, Columbine, Lakewood, Mullen, Pomona and Ralston Valley.\n\nSouth Metro \u2014 Arapahoe, Gateway, Grand Junction, Heritage, Hinkley, Rangeview and Smoky Hill.\n\nDraw your own conclusions. The ever-powerful Centennial added five-time state champion Valor Christian and dropped Smoky Hill (the Buffaloes haven\u2019t had a winning record in two dozen years). The Jeffco League has reunited all the top county schools, along with Mullen.\n\nFurthermore, Western Slope schools Fruita Monument and Grand Junction are in Denver-area leagues. So are Colorado Springs teams. Denver East and Montbello have been placed with north-metro schools. And longtime big-schooler Fort Collins has shrunk to 4A.\n\nMany of the moves have raised questions.\n\nBut don\u2019t take my word for it. In gathering preview information earlier this month, I polled as many appropriate 5A head coaches as possible, an attempt to pick their brains and gather their thoughts.\n\nHere\u2019s some of what they said:\n\nMike Schmitt, Eaglecrest: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to play through the type of league we play through when other teams are getting 40-point wins and get into playoffs, then we get seeded pretty low.\u201d\n\nSeth Replogle, Overland: \u201cOur league is insane. The biggest thing to me is, I don\u2019t mind playing those guys, the (Cherry) Creek schools are all together, and throwing Valor in there, well, it had to go somewhere. Now, it\u2019s the challenge in front of us. The biggest thing will be how we get into the playoffs.\u201d\n\nMonte Thelen, Cherokee Trail: \u201cJust look at who\u2019s in what league. Just run down the list. Run down Jeffco and run down the Centennial. I don\u2019t think you find a weak sister. Compare that to other people\u2019s leagues and schedules.\u201d\n\nRyan Hollingshead, Castle View: \u201cI like what they did to help out the Western Slope schools, but I think it\u2019s good to keep competitive league play. I don\u2019t know why we have leagues and don\u2019t reward them. \u2026 I think it\u2019s OK. We\u2019re never going to get it perfect. There will always be somebody to be unhappy.\u201d\n\nJohn Schultz, Grandview: \u201cAre we in the SEC South or what? (The Wolves are in the Centennial.) I put in my letter in our program that every team in our league was in the final 16 or better, and five of the six in the final eight or better. It\u2019s pretty impressive.\u201d\n\nMark Robinson, Highlands Ranch: \u201cI don\u2019t like it. I think those leagues (the Centennial and Jeffco) should be split up a bit.\u201d\n\nDave Gonzales, Rangeview: \u201cWell, it definitely will be interesting. From what I understand, the top 32 still make playoffs, then there\u2019s some leeway as far as how they seed it. It sounds like it will be more balanced. We\u2019ll see how it shakes out.\u201d\n\nAndy Lowry, Columbine: \u201cI know we had some proposals brought on board as far as teams making playoffs. We\u2019re in such a tough league (Jeffco). Some probably could battle for other league championships and not win a game in our league. It\u2019s going to be tough. Most of the wins are between the (Centennial and Jeffco) leagues. \u2026 The waterfall is the only equitable way of doing it. It makes for balanced leagues. I hope we get something going. For every time we have a proposal, it ends up being defeated, then two years later it gets passed.\u201d\n\nRobbie Owens, Grand Junction: \u201cI think, overall, I like where we\u2019re at (the new South Metro). I got into a good conference, but I hate the 5A-4A combo conference (Tigers were in the 5A-4A Southwestern), so I didn\u2019t care where they put us. I wanted to be in a Denver conference. We\u2019re traveling the same distance. For us to travel now is no different. I\u2019m just excited to be in a 5A conference. But there\u2019s probably a better system to spread out the teams.\u201d\n\nRobert Doyle, Legend: \u201cFor us, it\u2019s great. I feel like we got into a good conference (Continental South). I feel good where we\u2019re at. If you\u2019re in the Valor league, you\u2019re (angry). Other than that, it\u2019s very good. It should help with the playoff positioning. It\u2019s a little more consistent, I would say.\u201d\n\nRod Sherman, Valor Christian: \u201cI think our conference is the SEC of Colorado. I think what the football committee did was make a pretty strong conference and we\u2019re excited about that, with the tremendous venues, the tremendous coaches. \u2026 I really think it\u2019s a unique year. It should be an enjoyable year to watch and cover.\u201d\n\nMark Brook, Rocky Mountain: \u201cObviously, with adding Monarch, Fairview and Legacy (to a new Front Range) we\u2019ll be a good conference. It\u2019s interesting, and we\u2019ll see how it all breaks down. We\u2019ll have a lot better idea once the playoffs roll around, but I hope it works out well.\u201d\n\nMike Marquez, Thornton: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t impact us too much. I\u2019m a straight shooter \u2014 we probably have one of the weaker, if not the weakest (Flatirons), in 5A. I\u2019ve always felt that way with the demographics. But I want a competitive 10-game schedule with kids working hard to win, not just to be the next game for teams with championship aspirations. We live with it. What I didn\u2019t like was making an eight-team conference and messing with some of the flexibility of the nonconference schedule.\u201d\n\nPhil Bravo, Monarch: \u201cHere\u2019s the difference in 5A: I make the bracket, the playoffs. The quad system guarantees a No. 2 in the opposite quadrant. For those powerful leagues (Centennial and Jeffco), they will get their representation. Their biggest complaint was playoff representation. Everybody stands in awe of those two leagues, and rightly so. They are pretty darned good football programs. But it is what it is.\u201d\n\nGene Hill, Douglas County: \u201cI loved the waterfall. I thought it was a pretty progressive idea. But you know how change here is a pretty slow process. (The waterfall) was a chance to build up new rivalries, and with bigger playoffs you end up playing different teams.\u201d\n\nJoe Johnson, ThunderRidge: \u201cI think the Centennial will be just brutal and very likely a good football team may not make the playoffs. That would be too bad. We had some groups try to meet and get some things together. There are lot of things that go into making leagues beyond the game itself. You have administrators involved. But, to me, I think the most alarming thing to me is you have teams and leagues that clearly are avoiding competition in order to gain wild-card points, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. I think it could be easily solved by (the Colorado High School Activities Association) by making them play people from two separate leagues. You just cant make a back door agreement before the CHSAA decides who you\u2019re going to play. And that is happening.\u201d\n\nPat Sandoval, Brighton: \u201cI agree. I mean, to mix things up, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s politics. \u2026 I tried three to four years ago to balance it up. Nobody wants it. I don\u2019t care for it (the current outlay). The two elite leagues will definitely be busting each other up.\u201d\n\nRod Dobbs, Chaparral: \u201cI really don\u2019t get all wrapped into that. I know we play Grandview, then Bear Creek. \u2026 You just have to prepare for whoever and everybody.\u201d\n\nMarty McVicker, Poudre: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to think. One thing that worries me is because of the quadrants, you could end up as a fifth seed and get switched because maybe you\u2019re matched up with your conference and you\u2019re bumped to an 8. I\u2019m a little leery of that. Teams won\u2019t want to play each other again, but I\u2019m worried about getting respect.\u201d\n\nJeff Braun, Lakewood: \u201cI guess my thing about that, if you come out of the Centennial or our (Jeffco) league, you could be 5-4, but not have as many points as teams in other leagues that are 7-2 or 6-3. And you don\u2019t have to take the pounding. You don\u2019t have to line up against Cherry Creek, Grandview, Valor, Pomona, Columbine and Ralston Valley. These two leagues are unbelievable. These are two SEC leagues.\u201d\n\nDave Logan, Cherry Creek: \u201cI would just say that I think it\u2019s laughable.\u201d\n\nMark Nolan, Regis Jesuit: \u201cI don\u2019t really get caught up in the highs or lows of that stuff. The way realignment works is, it\u2019s like the weather \u2014 if you don\u2019t like it, wait 10 minutes, or in this case, wait two years and it changes. But it\u2019s weird that conferences are different from fall sports to winter to spring, and some schools are 4A in one sport, then 5A in another.\u201d\n\nBret McGatlin, Chatfield: \u201cWhen (the waterfall) originally came out, we were looking for a balance of paper only because (Jeffco teams) would beat each other up. No reward for us being one league, not like in Division I. A team can win another league, but probably be a fifth- or sixth-place team that could win it, but it is what it is. I don\u2019t want to whine and complain because if we can make it through, we\u2019ll be sitting good.\u201d\n\nJay Madden, Pomona: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense, but it\u2019s the way the world\u2019s going.\u201d\n\nTom Thenell, Mullen: \u201cIt\u2019s just kind of ironic. \u2026 It\u2019s like from the old movie where every time they call it a business, we call it a game and or they call it a business. \u2026 That\u2019s kind of the game we\u2019re playing. It\u2019s just hypocrisy, and it has been going on forever.\u201d\n\nWayne Voorhees, Legacy: \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty accurate. It\u2019s good to play schools where kids grew up playing each other. We\u2019re playing Horizon and Mountain Range again. But there are two conferences that are pretty brutal and will get beat up, so we\u2019ll see what that does leading to the playoffs.\u201d\n\nTom McCartney, Fairview: \u201cIt\u2019s definitely interesting for both of those leagues. There are great rivalries in there, great proximity to where those schools are, so will make for great football week in, week out. Because of playoff format, they still will have great playoff representation. Those leagues will be really, really good. We already know of some of those teams that don\u2019t have the best records and how good they are.\u201d\n\nZach Morris, Bear Creek: \u201cIt\u2019 s a dicey situation a little bit. It\u2019s tough, we\u2019re in a tough league with no days off. But we\u2019re going to go against a tough team every single week. I was intrigued by the waterfall as well. That was kind of the route coaches wanted. It would have more competitive balance. But we\u2019re excited to play against the best teams in the state.\u201d\n\nRic Cash, Mountain Vista: \u201cI think until we\u2019re ready to try something a little more unique, we\u2019re going to end up with more of same. We\u2019re going to still feel the same at the end of the season. The haves, the have-nots, teams getting over-seeded. \u2026 We may have a team that\u2019s 4-6 but could have won a league title. I don\u2019t know how we make it better without doing something radically different. I like our league, but it won\u2019t necessarily clean out the disparity.\u201d\n\nFrank Ybarra, Horizon: \u201cI don\u2019t mind the 32-team bracket, but here\u2019s my problem: When they start doing the seeding, we feel like those two leagues (Centennial and Jeffco) have most of the influence. We feel like our league won\u2019t get the respect when it time for seeding. Me personally, if those two are the best, we\u2019re the third best. I just hope it\u2019s pretty unbiased at the end of the season. Our league champ could be a five or six seed and get bumped to an eight. That\u2019s kind of our concern.\u201d\n\nSpencer Colter, Denver East: \u201cYou know, I\u2019d just say it is what it is. I don\u2019t get too much into it. I see what you see. But what can you do about it? I don\u2019t like it. I think there are better ways to do it, spread it out and have more parity.\u201d\n\nTodd Riccio, Prairie View: \u201cWell, they have to put Valor somewhere, I guess. I know there were big debates just about what they\u2019ve accomplished. That Centennial League is the league of death, the group of death. It\u2019s a big powerhouse. All those teams will be well-tested and played out. And Jeffco has power. It will be a battle for the rest of us. And that\u2019s all we can do, go and compete.\u201d\n\nBob Simmons, Boulder: \u201cYou know what? All those teams (in Centennial and Jeffco) are good teams. I think that\u2019s what they did with the alignment, they tried do it with size and numbers and make power conferences. Over the years, look at the pedigree of schools like Mullen and Valor. Here in Boulder, we\u2019ve gotten small in numbers. We\u2019ve got to build it back up.\u201d\n\nJeff Krumlauf, Doherty: \u201cI mean, I think all of the realignments are really good. I think the conferences are very tough. The joke is, whatever conference Valor is in is an SEC in our 5A, but we look at the Continental North and were in the Continental South, and we think our leagues are just as strong. We honored to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nBrian Lamb, Rock Canyon: \u201cI like it for us being local with the rest of the Highlands Ranch schools. I\u2019m glad not to see Valor anymore. Even with Fruita and Grand Junction, it doesn\u2019t bother me going out there. I kind of like where we\u2019re positioned.\u201d\n\nSean Mulvey, Fruita Monument: \u201cWell, the waterfall thing is good and does what it\u2019s intended to, but look at those two conferences: a murderers\u2019 row. I\u2019d hate to be at the bottom of those groups. I feel like we have one of the top conferences as well, just having ThunderRidge and Regis. But there are some good teams and we\u2019re excited about competing with them.\u201d\n\nMatt Dean, Northglenn: \u201cI don\u2019t mind it. I think you can go on both sides of the fence and have an argument. For transportation, schools are having to allocate a little harder for the lower-income districts. Having the talent pool as far as record-wise (with the waterfall) would have been good. But I think I like how it ended up. We\u2019ll take what we get, and won\u2019t throw a fit, and play football. More than the waterfall, they should look at how some schools get away with some things.\u201d\n\nMatt Loyd, Ralston Valley: \u201cObviously, that Centennial, I believe, is tough. We\u2019re in a tough one, but not as tough as that one. You know what? If that\u2019s the way people want to do it, OK. There are some leagues not as strong, but it is what it is. For me, I like playing tough teams and a hard schedule.\u201d\n\nMike Campbell, Arapahoe: \u201cI think it helped us. I\u2019m not against what we did, but I\u2019m not super-excited, just ambivalent. That Centennial is ridiculous, so is the Jeffco, so much better than everybody else.\u201d\n\nKerry Denison, Westminster: \u201cMaybe we could make a 6A. Every other division has 10 weeks for regular season. We have that playoff round and it doesn\u2019t draw any more people. It ends up costing a lot more. I\u2019d like to see us go back to the 10th week. And, you know, if it\u2019s done that way, put those powerhouses in 6A.\u201d\n\nRobbie O\u2019Brien, Hinkley: \u201cI tell my kids that all we can do is control what we can control. I don\u2019t put too much on who we play or who somebody else plays.\u201d\n\nBryan Davey Mountain Range: \u201cIn one aspect, I like it because it puts a school district within a school district. I like that piece of it to boost the rivalries. When you play in a league like that, in a Centennial League, an Overland-type team could be four or five (seed), but lose to Grandview and Cherokee Trail, and have high-quality losses. I just hope with the additions and rules in the playoff bracket that they\u2019ll do a better job of aligning playoff teams. I played Cherokee Trail in the second round (last year), but they had three Centennial teams in the same bracket I was in, and that\u2019s not fair to them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Devlin: Colorado 5A football coaches comment on realignment", "title": "Devlin: Colorado 5A football coaches comment on realignment", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/08/23/devlin-colorado-5a-football-coaches-comment-on-realignment/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-24T00:01:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-24T00:01:13+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "That Centennial League is the league of death, the group of death.\nI don\u2019t know why we have leagues and don\u2019t reward them.\nI am on record as stating Colorado blew it again in terms of realignment for the next two years of Class 5A football.\nI don\u2019t think you find a weak sister.\nI don\u2019t know how we make it better without doing something radically different."}
