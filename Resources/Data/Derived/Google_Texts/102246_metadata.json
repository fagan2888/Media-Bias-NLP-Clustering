In one state, \u201cthere\u2019s so little back-up the auditor can\u2019t decide who did what, if any, work.\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s getting even worse.\n\nJudicial Watch, the Washington watchdog, has announced a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services for records concerning contracts and consultancy agreements with Gruber.\n\nThe organization is targeting a 2009 deal with Gruber in which he was the only person considered for the work and was paid nearly $400,000.\n\nJudicial Watch said it filed the lawsuit after HHS refused to respond to a November 2014 FOIA request.\n\nGet \u201cSurviving the Medical Meltdown\u201d by Dr. Lee Hieb, M.D., for the expert tips of \u201cliving through the disaster of Obamacare.\n\nSought are records regarding the deal in which Clint Druk of the HHS Program Support Center reported: \u201cThe Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE), intends to negotiate with Jonathan Gruber, Ph.D. on a sole sources basis for technical assistance in evaluating options for national healthcare reform. The basis for restricting competition is the authority 13.106-1(b) because only one source is reasonably available to satisfy agency requirements. The anticipated contract period will be for one year.\u201d\n\nDruk had written: \u201cDr. Gruber\u2019s ongoing advisory role with the Office of Health Reform strongly positions him to meet HHS\u2019 requirements the most efficiently, which is a key requirement in order for well-developed legislative proposals to be put forth for congressional consideration as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nGruber himself confirmed the first part of the contract was for $95,000 and federal documents reveal an extension for $297,600.\n\nJudicial Watch said there are reports Gruber was paid \u201cat least\u201d $5.9 million after joining forces with President Obama to assemble a national health care law.\n\nAccording to the Daily Caller\u2019s Chuck Ross, the federal government has paid Gruber at least $4 million since 2000 for his work as an expert witness, a legal consultant and for his consultation on Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThat comes on top of at least $1.6 million the MIT economist has been paid by several states to consult on their health care bills,'\u201d Judicial Watch said.\n\nLast year, a video surfaced on the American Commitment website showing Gruber talking about how hiding information from the American public is a huge political advantage.\n\nObamacare, he said, \u201cwas written in a tortured way to make sure that CBO (the Congressional Budget Office) did not score the mandate as taxes.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf CBO scores the mandate as taxes, the bill dies. OK. So it\u2019s written to do that. In terms of risk-rated subsidies, if you had a law that made it explicit that the healthy people pay in and sick people get money, it would not have passed,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cLack of transparency is a huge political advantage. Call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass,\u201d said Gruber.\n\nSee the video:\n\nJudicial Watch President Tom Fitton said the Obama HHS is \u201cflouting FOIA law to keep the truth about Gruber from the American public and, it seems, the Supreme Court.\u201d\n\n\u201cHHS doesn\u2019t want to disclose Mr. Gruber\u2019s key role in Obamacare because his statements could be used by the high court to upend Obama\u2019s illegal tax subsidies,\u201d Fitton said. \u201cWhy else would HHS go into full cover-up mode about contracts with one man?\u201d\n\nFitton said that from the beginning, \u201clack of transparency\u201d has been essential to keeping Obamacare alive.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s knowing lies about how Americans could keep their doctors and insurance under Obamacare show that he is no better than Gruber in his contempt for \u2018stupid\u2019 American voters.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court now is deciding whether subsidies designated solely for those who get their policies from state exchanges can also be granted to people who use the national exchange.\n\nJudicial Watch said it has sued the Obama administration nearly a dozen times since 2013 to get basic information about the health care takeover.\n\nWND previously reported that while the Obama administration tried to distance itself from Gruber and his comments, the professor\u2019s official bio at a university project known to be close to the White House boasted that Gruber helped to craft Obamacare.\n\nGruber\u2019s bio at the Hamilton Project, an economic initiative launched by the Brookings Institution in 2006, reads: \u201cDuring 2009-2010 he served as a technical consultant to the Obama Administration and worked with both the Administration and Congress to help craft the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nAnd Obama himself spoke at the 2006 launch of the Hamilton Project, where he stated he had stolen ideas \u201cliberally\u201d from Gruber.\n\nGalen Institute President Grace-Marie Turner said Gruber not only confirmed many of the conservative Obamacare criticisms but revealed the ugly side of how the administration pursued its signature legislative priority.\n\n\u201cThis kind of validation from Jonathan Gruber, the architect of this law, is really shocking; that he would admit that the only way they would possibly be able to get this passed was basically to lie to the American people,\u201d said Turner in a recent interview.\n\nShe added that those fears have been confirmed by the rising disapproval numbers for the law as more details become known.\n\n\u201cThe more people find out about the law, the more they were realized how they were duped with all of the promises,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thing I think is really telling is that this is the guy who really helped shape and craft this law. For him to say the only way they could get it passed was through trickery is astonishing.\n\nTurner also believes Gruber\u2019s attitude is indicative of the entire administration\u2019s approach to health care and other policies.\n\n\u201cI really think that it\u2019s part of the whole philosophy, the whole philosophy that health care is just too complicated for people to figure out for themselves and all these smart elites need to figure it out for us,\u201d she said.\n\nListen to the WND/Radio America interview with Grace-Marie Turner:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "Ever since it was exposed that MIT professor Jonathan Gruber admitted Obamacare was \u201cwritten in a tortured way\u201d to pass muster with \u201cstupid\u201d American voters, he\u2019s been having problems.
