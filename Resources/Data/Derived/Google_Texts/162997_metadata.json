Although she had been reported as missing there hadn\u2019t been a search by authorities.\n\nBut when her body was discovered late Saturday morning, July 29, in a wooded field on the outskirts of Buena Vista, the case immediately became a homicide investigation.\n\nShe had been stabbed numerous times in the arms, chest and stomach.\n\nHurtado\u2019s body was fulled clothed.\n\nThe next day, Sunday, July 30, 1977, Deputy District Attorney Doug Anderson said the prime suspect was this unidentified man seen with Hurtado on Thursday evening.\n\nShe was seen with him in the afternoon and then in the evening someone saw her taking a walk with the young man.\n\n\u201cIt may be nothing; it may be something,\u201d Anderson was quoted as saying in an Associated Press article that appeared in The Denver Post on Aug. 1, 1977.\n\nAnyone with information that could held solve Hurtado\u2019s case is asked to call the Buena Vista Police Department at (719) 395-8654.\n\nDenver Post staff writer Kirk Mitchell can be reached at 303-954-1206 or twitter.com/kmitchelldp.
