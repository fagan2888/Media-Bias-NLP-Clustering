The halfpipe is a U-shaped trench with walls.\n\n\u201cI am excited to compete and learn from the best in the world,\u201d said this year's first-place finisher in the women's halfpipe competition, Summer Fenton, 19, of San Francisco, who started riding at age 4 \u2014 not uncommon in the sport.\n\nWith one of only two Olympic-size halfpipes on the East Coast, Seven Springs is poised to become a regional incubator, outfitted with facilities to train snowboarders to compete on the world stage.\n\nSean Stipp is a Trib Total Media photographer.
