Pregnant smokers in Ohio who quit smoking will be rewarded with free diapers, courtesy of a state grant from the health department’s Child and Family Health Services.

The program, which will begin in northeast Ohio’s Summit County, is patterned after the “Baby & Me-Tobacco Free” program and has a $61,000 budget.

Pregnant smokers must attend a minimum of four prenatal support classes and pass a monthly carbon monoxide test in order to receive a $25 diaper voucher from Walmart each month for a year.

“I don’t want any harm done to them or my other ones I have here,” said Britney Lykes, 24. “You have to think about the babies.” Lykes, who is pregnant with twins, will be eligible for two $25 vouchers a month.

According to the Baby & Me-Tobacco Free website, several other agencies in various states are currently funding the program.
