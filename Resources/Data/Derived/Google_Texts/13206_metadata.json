So, Reason TV's Zach Weissmueller spent a day riding around Los Angeles in Ubers, talking to drivers about some of the rumors swirling around the company: That it doesn't pay its drivers well, that it runs shoddy background checks that put riders at risk, and that its drivers fail to pick up people in bad neighborhoods. He also made a stop at Yellow Cab headquarters to talk with William Rouse, the general manager of Yellow Cab Los Angeles and an outspoken critic of Uber. And for his final leg of the journey, Weissmueller jumped into a good old-fashioned yellow taxi.\n\nTo find out what happened, watch the video above.\n\nApproximately 10 minutes. Produced by Zach Weissmueller and Justin Monticello. Camera by Monticello.\n\nScroll down for downloadable versions of this video and don't forget to subscribe to Reason TV's YouTube channel for daily content like this.\n\nThis story was orginally posted at Reason.com on August 10, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "A taxi tour around Los Angeles.", "title": "'There Are Felons Behind the Wheel!'
