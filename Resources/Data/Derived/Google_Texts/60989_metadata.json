There's a buzz about scent like never before'\n\nFunny how a throwaway remark can change a life. The world has YOU to thank for The Perfume Society, which launches this very day, because it began as a Perfume Panel in the magazine for its readers: ten perfumistas, clustered around a table at B.Hive in Covent Garden, there to review ten of the new season\u2019s scents. As I passed the fragrances and smelling strips around, along with Lorna McKay \u2013 the fragrance expert I\u2019d enlisted to talk about the history of perfume and how best to explore the world of scent \u2013 I commented: \u2018You know, it\u2019s so weird that there\u2019s no Perfume Society.\u2019\n\nShivers went up my spine in a way they probably hadn\u2019t since I discovered the two squares of 70 per cent dark chocolate on my husband Craig Sams\u2019s desk, which led to the idea for Green & Black\u2019s, the world\u2019s first organic chocolate business that he and I started together in 1991 and ran for nine years. Then YOU\u2019s editor Sue Peart, who had come along to the Perfume Panel to meet the readers, laughed and said: \u2018Well, Jo, I think you should set one up!\u2019\n\nThe Perfume Society's Lorna (left) and Josephine compare notes\n\nI sat down at my iPad, Googled \u2018perfume society\u2019 and found nada. The fourth Google listing was Steak Appreciation Society. When I next logged on to my domain-name provider and found that scentsociety, perfumesociety and fragrancesociety were all sitting there waiting for me, I pounced, realising that a serious organisation for scent-lovers like me really didn\u2019t exist, anywhere.\n\nTwo and a half years later, it does \u2013 with Lorna (former fragrance and beauty buyer at Harrods, visionary behind the Liberty Perfumery and the woman who brought countless brands, including Liz Earle, to QVC) as my partner in the venture.\n\n\n\nLorna is as nuts about fragrance as I have been since the days I used to spend my pocket money on Aqua Manda, which I\u2019d proudly display on my dressing table, alongside bottles of Dior Eau Fra\u00eeche, Chanel Cristalle, YSL Rive Gauche and Herm\u00e8s Cal\u00e8che, which my father brought back from his business travels. Grown-up tastes for a teenage girl, perhaps, but the scent of any one of them has the power, even now, to Tardis me through time to that dormer-windowed bedroom, listening to Radio Caroline and drenching myself in (I liked to think) liquid sophistication when I should have been doing my homework.\n\nJosephine in Grasse with rose petals destined for Chanel's iconic fragrance No5\n\nI\u2019ve always loved the description \u2013 by the remarkable Helen Keller, who was both blind and deaf \u2013 that \u2018smell is a potent wizard that transports you across thousands of miles, and all the years you have lived\u2019. No wonder so many of us are fascinated by scent and want to know more.\n\nNow, for the past 23 years, since I won a Jasmine Award for writing about scent, I\u2019ve had access to the most charismatic figures in the world of perfumery: the bottle designers, creative directors and evaluators (who nanny a fragrance from idea to launch, such as Est\u00e9e Lauder\u2019s Karyn Khoury), as well as the \u2018noses\u2019 themselves (from Chanel\u2019s extraordinary Jacques Polge and Christopher Sheldrake to Guerlain\u2019s genius Thierry Wasser), and dozens of other gifted craftspeople. I\u2019ve also been lucky enough to see the roses and jasmine for Chanel\u2019s iconic No5 being harvested and distilled in Grasse.\n\nAnd right now, I believe, is the most exciting time in fragrance\u2019s history. Lorna and I liken it to what happened 20 years ago in food, when the chefs came out of the kitchen, talking about ingredients and terroir, igniting us with their enthusiasm and turning us into foodies. That excitement is now being mirrored in fragrance: perfumers telling the stories behind their creations, artisan producers springing up. There\u2019s a buzz about scent, from the high street to haute perfumery, as never before.\n\nJOSEPHINE'S FRAGRANT FIVE\n\nSince I\u2019m lucky enough to smell every new perfume that spritzes its way on to the market, my dressing table boasts many, many scent \u2018loves\u2019; however, here are five that I always return to and what they mean to me. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle Lipstick Rose With its armfuls of roses and violets, it is exactly like the scent of the inside of my mother\u2019s handbag \u2013 pure I-want-my-Mummy nostalgia. Chanel Les Exclusifs Sycomore I\u2019m crazy for the scent of vetiver: smoky, earthy, deep. For me, this is a go-to scent when I need my feet planting firmly on the ground after living with my head in the clouds (or cyberspace). 4711 The bottle\u2019s barely changed since it launched in 1792, and nor has the scent. An affordable cologne that I splash on liberally in summer \u2013 it\u2019s as refreshing as a long lemonade with a sprig of mint tucked inside. Another teen favourite that takes me right back. Schiaparelli Shocking Bought for me by my husband Craig in 1991 on the trip to Paris that inspired our shocking-pink wedding. This vintage bottle sits at the back of my lingerie drawer, in the dark \u2013 but when I unstopper it I\u2019m right there, in my bright-pink frock. (Rumour is Shocking might be coming back \u2013 hurrah!) Guerlain Mitsouko Less well-known than Guerlain\u2019s Shalimar, Mitsouko is the favourite scent of Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez, authors of Perfumes: The A-Z Guide \u2013 and it\u2019s my \u2018desert island\u2019 scent, the snugglesome, so-chic swirl of peach, rose, jasmine, patchouli, oakmoss and more, which I return to time and again.\n\nIt took a year of toing and froing for Lorna and me to even figure out what our Perfume Society should be. A massive, informational website, for a start: history, the stories behind the perfume houses, nose interviews, the latest scent news, ingredient explanations; 220,000 words and hundreds of ingredients later, perfume has now taken over from \u2018The History of British Confectionery, 1956 to the present day\u2019 as my possible Mastermind subject.\n\n\n\nBut, much more than that, The Perfume Society is an opportunity for fragrance-lovers to have exclusive VIP (Very Important Perfumista!) access to some of those incredible noses and creators at events, to learn how to put together perfumes themselves at workshops and to simply get together with friends to form a local Perfume Group (like a book club without the homework, we call it) via a monthly activity we\u2019ll be sharing.\n\n\n\nAbove all, perfume lovers will get to smell things in a way that will turbocharge their enjoyment of fragrance, leading to a new appreciation of notes, harmonies and scents. Rather in the way that joining a wine society transforms your appreciation of wine.\n\nLike most good ideas, it\u2019s grown into something much bigger than our original notion, with Fragrance Education boxes available to subscribers (featuring smelling notes \u2013 again, like a wine society), and How to Improve Your Sense of Smell sessions around the country. (For which I\u2019ll be sharing a workshop I gave for The School of Life based on wisdom taught to me by three of the world\u2019s top noses. The session has the potential to transform anyone\u2019s sense of smell from a six-stone weakling \u2013 \u2018the fallen angel of our senses\u2019, as Helen Keller put it \u2013 into a veritable Arnold Schwarzenegger, through a simple daily exercise.)\n\n\n\nThe little newsletter we told fragrance brands about \u2013 who, as excited as we are about The Perfume Society, are giving us access to their archives and creators \u2013 has morphed into a downloadable magazine, The Scented Letter. And we\u2019ll soon be unveiling FR.eD: the virtual fragrance adviser Lorna came up with in the 1990s, which has had a 2014-style makeover for The Perfume Society website.\n\nA team of two became a team of three, then four, and now five of us. Flat out. As my fourth start-up (I somehow opened an organic bakery and a health centre after selling Green & Black\u2019s), there have been a gazillion things to do \u2013 though I quell any rising panic with the knowledge that most of them only ever need to be done once. But the truth is, it\u2019s the most exciting thing I\u2019ve ever done (Green & Black\u2019s notwithstanding) and \u2013 so she tells me \u2013 that Lorna\u2019s ever done, too.\n\n\n\nI see women (and plenty of men) everywhere waking up to the realisation that fragrance is an art form \u2013 like music or painting. But the difference is we can wear it every day, triggering memories of people, places, experiences and creating memories of ourselves, too, for those around us. (And sometimes, just sometimes, making someone fall a little bit more in love with us\u2026)\n\nAnd it\u2019s all happened because of one person\u2019s throwaway remark.
