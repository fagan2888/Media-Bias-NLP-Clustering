"If stocks are selling, and if people are generally pretty panicked about the state of the global economy, bond markets are a natural safe haven," said Matthew Graham, chief operating officer of Mortgage News Daily. "Popular opinion about rates moving higher only helped. Too many people were on one side of that trade, and it almost always makes sense to root for the underdog in those scenarios."



Lower mortgage rates certainly offer homebuyers lower monthly payments and at the same time help them to qualify for larger loans, so they can buy more expensive homes. The latter is particularly pertinent this spring, as home prices are rising due to record low supply of homes for sale. On the flip side, a weaker economy, stock market losses and general unease about the fate of employment and wage growth all hurt housing.

This would not, however, translate to negative mortgage rates. That is impossible. Lenders only lend if they can make money.



"As far as the connection to mortgage rates, it's no different than it was," said Graham. "The Fed rate is only loosely connected over longer time horizons. Whether the Fed hikes or cuts below zero, the global economic panic will be good for rates."
