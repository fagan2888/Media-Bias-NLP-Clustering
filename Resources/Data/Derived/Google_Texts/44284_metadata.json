Rick Warren, pastor of Saddleback Church, and Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, each gave speeches, and representatives from the Heritage Foundation and the Family Research Council in Washington attended. President Henry Eyring of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2019 first presidency spoke and Elder Tom Perry of the LDS\u2019s Quorum of the Twelve also joined. In the United States, this trio of faiths has worked together to stand against the government\u2019s Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception mandate, but it was the first time they were coming together at the Vatican to talk about marriage.\n\nThe colloquium rallied around the theological concept of complementarianism, the belief that men and women have different roles in a marriage and religious leadership\u2014husbands are spiritual leaders, and wives submit to them in love. To be \u201ccomplementary\u201d is to complete or fill the lack in the other thing. It opposes egalitarianism, the theological belief that men and women are equal in all respects in marriage and in religious leadership positions. Traditional Catholic, evangelical, and LDS belief interprets the Bible to support a complementarian relational structure. That may explain why mainline Protestant traditions that interpret the Bible to an egalitarian end\u2014Presbyterian, Episcopal, United Church of Christ\u2014were not featured at the event.\n\nPope Francis did not spearhead the colloquium, as many casual observers might think. It was organized and led by German Cardinal Gerhard M\u00fcller, a strong conservative voice at the Pope\u2019s Synod on the Family last month. M\u00fcller is the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican group that sponsored the event. Still, Pope Francis gave an opening address to attendees, in which he affirmed the Church\u2019s teaching that children have a right to a mother and a father.\n\nSkepticism about the other\u2019s faith tends to run deep between Catholics, evangelicals and Mormons. In strict economic terms, the three faiths all compete for followers. They are heavily missionizing, and often they evangelize precisely in ways that distinguish themselves apart from the other faiths. But the Protestant work ethic runs deep in both evangelical and Mormon culture, as does deep commitment to faith convictions that the outside world may not understand. The gathering signals that some Vatican leaders recognize that banding together to support marriage as between one man and one woman may be a smart strategy going forward, especially as they have been standing separately against the western world\u2019s changing sexual mores.\n\nOn paper, the colloquium concluded with an affirmation of marriage. \u201cFor on earth marriage binds us across the ages in the flesh, across families in the flesh, and across the fearful and wonderful divide of man and woman, in the flesh. This is not ours to alter,\u201d it reads. \u201cIt is ours, however, to encourage and celebrate\u2026.This we affirm.\u201d\n\nBut in practice, it ended with something more significant\u2014a strengthening of alliances. The event forged and deepened relationships across faith lines. \u201cThis group differs on many points\u2014theological and political\u2014but we agree that marriage matters,\u201d says Moore, who walked around the Vatican with a copy of Luther\u2019s 95 Theses in his coat pocket, a symbol of Protestantism\u2019s break with Rome 500 years ago. \u201cThe colloquium started a conversation of groups on virtually every continent and virtually every religious tradition on how we can work together for the common good of marriage.\u201d\n\nFor Eyring, of the LDS Church, the event marks a beginning. \u201cThey are talking about how are we going to get the word out and what more can we do. They want to do more,\u201d he told the Deseret News. \u201cIt\u2019s been amazing how receptive they have been to us,\u201d Perry added, describing relationship he has been developing with Catholic leaders. \u201cI think that we\u2019ve developed a relationship now that they recognized that we have the strength and our structure in our organization that can reach out in a way that other churches do not have.\u201d\n\nAmerican evangelical leaders say they are also leaving hopeful of the journey ahead. \u201cThe content of the colloquium was important, but perhaps more so were the connections made between people who share come concerns but who didn\u2019t know each other before,\u201d Moore says. \u201cI am leaving the colloquium much more optimistic than I was when I arrived.\u201d\n\nAdds Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council: \u201cThe atmosphere was almost euphoric as the attendees from six of the world\u2019s seven continents broke from the historic gathering to return to their respective nations renewed in their stand for marriage,\u201d he says. \u201cThe courts may declare otherwise, and Hollywood may depict its demise, but the union of a man and a woman as the natural and enduring definition of marriage will endure until the end.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "American evangelicals and Mormons went to the Vatican to strengthen ties as they fight same-sex marriage.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "American evangelicals and Mormons went to the Vatican to strengthen ties as they fight same-sex marriage.", "title": "Vatican Strengthens Ties with Evangelicals and Mormons Against Gay Marriage", "url": "http://time.com/3597245/vatican-evangelicals-mormons-gay-marriage/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/pope-francis1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/pope-francis1.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "American evangelicals and Mormons went to the Vatican to strengthen ties as they fight same-sex marriage.", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Vatican Strengthens Ties with Evangelicals and Mormons Against Gay Marriage"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "faith, religion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "pope francis, pope, vatican, humanum, catholic, evangelical, mormon, russell moore, rick warren, eyring"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb5ee\"", "article_summary": "M\u00fcller is the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican group that sponsored the event.\nIt opposes egalitarianism, the theological belief that men and women are equal in all respects in marriage and in religious leadership positions.\nSkepticism about the other\u2019s faith tends to run deep between Catholics, evangelicals and Mormons.\nThe presence of American evangelicals and the LDS Church was particularly notable.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been amazing how receptive they have been to us,\u201d Perry added, describing relationship he has been developing with Catholic leaders."}
