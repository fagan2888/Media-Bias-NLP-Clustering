The \u201cwelcome mat\u201d caseload was estimated at 29,665 in 2014-15, growing to 39,818 in the next fiscal year, budget documents show.\n\nOverall, including the federally covered expanded population, HCPF initially estimated about 160,000 participants would qualify for Medicaid in the first year but were surprised when that figure nearly doubled to more than 300,000.\n\nThe state concedes that early projections were way off.\n\nThe \u201ccaseload growth that is attributable to Medicaid expansion has been much greater than projected in February 2014,\u201d HCPF officials wrote in a budget report to lawmakers.\n\nBartholomew said state planners had no idea the push to get people to sign up for insurance under the ACA would result in so many finding they were eligible for government-funded health care, but that happened because people signing up for insurance are first screened for Medicaid eligibility.\n\nSince the initial underestimate, state projections have been right on the mark, Bartholomew said.\n\n\u201cOur forecasts have been to one thousandths of one percent,\u201d he said.\n\nOverall, Colorado had less than 700,000 people covered by Medicaid in 2012-13, but now about 1.29 million residents \u2013 nearly a quarter of the population \u2013 get their health care paid for by taxpayers, state budget figures show.\n\nProjections show that caseload will increase to 1.4 million people by 2017-18, though year-over-year percentages will decrease to 4 or 5 percent a year after June 2016.\n\nBetween 2013 and this year, Medicaid figures show that Colorado had a 64 percent increase in Medicaid and related programs compared to 23.3 percent nationwide.\n\nAs the federal government ratchets down the percent it covers for the expanded population, Colorado has been collecting money to cover its extra costs with a hospital provider fee of 5.5 percent. The state spent about $4.3 million in 2014-15 from the fund, but budget planners expect that to skyrocket to $101 million by the 2017-18 fiscal year, according to figures Watchdog.org obtained.\n\nThat causes state budget problems because state revenue is limited by the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, which requires a refund to taxpayers if revenues exceed its limits. The hospital fee counts towards that ceiling.\n\n\u201cAt the present time, both available forecasts show that the State will not be able to retain all of the revenue available, and the excess revenue is a refund liability in the General Fund,\u201d Gov. John Hickenlooper wrote in his budget letter to the General Assembly. \u201cHowever, the presence of refunds under the revenue limit established by the Taxpayer\u2019s Bill of Rights (TABOR) is the result of cash fund revenue collected outside the General Fund, notably the hospital provider fee established in House Bill 09-1293.\u201d\n\nHickenlooper, in the letter, proposed a reduction in the fee for next year\u2019s budget, resulting in $100 million fewer collected, to take pressure off the budget.\n\nColorado Hospital Association spokeswoman Cara Welch said the group\u2019s members support the fee because it helps provide coverage for all residents.\n\n\u201cThe expansion has benefited Colorado by expanding access to care for previously uninsured populations, significantly reducing uncompensated care and lowering the under-reimbursement for Medicaid, which lowers costs for privately insured patients,\u201d she wrote in an email exchange.\n\nLast session, a bill would have exempted the hospital provider fee from state income limits, but it failed.\n\nGorman said the fee is a huge tax increase passed on to consumers and whether it is coming from the feds or the state, taxpayers are on the hook for billions of dollars because of the decision to expand Medicaid.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taking a lot of money out of the private sector,\u201d she said.\n\nOriginally published at ColoradoWatchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cIt\u2019s taking a lot of money out of the private sector.\"", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s taking a lot of money out of the private sector.\"", "title": "Colorado Medicaid Rolls Double After Expansion", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/1222medicaid.jpg", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1QVRxc2"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s taking a lot of money out of the private sector.\"", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/1222medicaid.jpg"}, "title": "Colorado Medicaid Rolls Double After Expansion", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Health Care", "tag": "medicaid", "published_time": "2015-12-22T14:51:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "medicaid,colorado,government waste,john hickenlooper"}, "article_summary": "Colorado\u2019s Medicaid caseload nearly doubled in the past two years after the state expanded coverage, surprising state budget officials and putting more pressure on state coffers.\nThese so-called \u201cwelcome mat\u201d Medicaid recipients cost state taxpayers $29.7 million in 2014-15, while the federal government paid $40.3 million for them.\nBetween 2013 and this year, Medicaid figures show that Colorado had a 64 percent increase in Medicaid and related programs compared to 23.3 percent nationwide.\nLinda Gorman, who studies health care issues for the Independence Institute, said the Medicaid expansion has been a disaster for the budget and patients.\nThat causes state budget problems because state revenue is limited by the Taxpayer Bill of Rights, which requires a refund to taxpayers if revenues exceed its limits."}
