Bishop McGuinness is no stranger success having made and won at least one playoff game 10 of the last 14 years.

This season, if the Irish hope to continue that success, they'll have to do so with quite the youth movement.

Bishop McGuinness will have 9 new starters on the offensive side of the ball. That includes not having one senior wide receiver.

One mainstay from last years squad is running back Braden Roy. The senior ran for more than 500 yards last season while hauling in over 350 receiving yards.

He'll carry the load at running back, but there is still question marks about who will hand him the ball.

Senior Jennings Jarman and junior Jacob Mullins are battling for the starting quarterback spot. Head coach Justin Jones said "one is a little bit ahead of the other" but wouldn't divulge who has the lead in the qb battle.

McGuinness earned a 7-5 record last season, but still expects to be among the contenders in 2014.
