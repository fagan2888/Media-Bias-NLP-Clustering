The analysis is proof, they claim, of the president\u2019s campaign to push more Americans on the government dole, expand social programs, and ask the rest of us to finance their lives of leisure.\n\n\u201cThe last Democratic president took concrete steps to mitigate the corrupting consequences of welfare. This one has fought tooth and nail to bring the intractable problems inherent to government aid to everybody in the country, and to transmute the safety net into a smothering, ambient cocoon,\u201d the National Review\u2019s Charles C. W. Cooke claims. Hot Air\u2019s Allahpundit \u2014 who Cooke cites approvingly \u2014 similarly suggests that the nation may have \u201creached the stage of welfare-state decadence where it\u2019s a selling point for a new entitlement that it discourages able-bodied people from working.\u201d\n\nAmericans, in short, are discouraged from working harder by a bloated government safety net. The claim feeds into a familiar conservative narrative \u2014 one that echoes Ronald Reagan\u2019s welfare queen narrative of the 1980s \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t reflect the reality of American labor.\n\nAmericans are working harder than ever while earning less. Productivity increased by nearly 8 percent from 2007 to 2012, but the amount the median American worker earned in a week fell from $770 just before the financial crisis to $768 in 2012. The median hourly earnings for American workers are now back to where they were in 2000 and wages are growing at just 2 percent per year, the slowest rate since at least 1965.\n\nAmericans are also working longer \u2014 more than our counterparts in most other developed countries. \u201cPeople in the United States work 1,787 hours a year, more than the OECD average of 1,776 hours,\u201d the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) finds, and \u201caround 11 percent of employees work very long hours, higher than the OECD average of 9 percent.\u201d Between 1979 and 2000, the proportion of workers putting in 50 hours or more per week increased by six percentage points.\n\nStill, that\u2019s not to say that social programs don\u2019t impact the labor force. At the center of the conservative critique is the claim that programs like the Affordable Care Act decrease an individual\u2019s incentive to work. Why toil full time to earn employer-sponsored health benefits if you can find coverage in the new exchanges? The answer, ironically, can be found in Cooke\u2019s own piece: Work \u201cis the means by which standards of living are grown, human potential is reached, individual lives are focused, positive and negative instincts are channeled, resources are utilized most efficiently, and, above all, by which dignity remains intact.\u201d\n\nGovernment benefit programs \u2014 from the ACA to Medicaid to Social Security \u2014 may encourage people to work a bit less. Individuals can choose to retire early, accept a better job, change careers, start a small business, or leave the workforce to raise a family. The number of Americans whose ambition is to build a life on food stamps and government-sponsored housing is, as the macro trends above suggest, negligible.\n\n\u201cOne way to think about how little sense this makes is to recognize that Social Security is probably the largest \u2018job killer\u2019 out there!\u201d Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden and now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said. \u201cGet rid of that and tons of folks would be forced to go back to work.\u201d That, after all, is the logical endpoint to such claims.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Are Americans discouraged from working harder by a bloated government safety net?", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Are Americans discouraged from working harder by a bloated government safety net?", "title": "No, Obamacare Isn\u2019t A War On The American Work Ethic", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/02/11/3278081/obamacare-work-ethic/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/jobsbanner-e1375443645201.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Are Americans discouraged from working harder by a bloated government safety net?", "creator": "@@igorvolsky", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/jobsbanner-e1375443645201.jpg", "title": "No, Obamacare Isn\u2019t A War On The American Work Ethic", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-economy", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/jobsbanner-e1375443645201.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/jobsbanner-e1375443645201.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-11T16:21:03+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/ivolsky"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1889\"", "article_summary": "Economy No, Obamacare Isn\u2019t A War On The American Work Ethic CREDIT:Conservatives have seized on a recent Congressional Budget Office report showing that the Affordable Care Act will cause 2.5 million Americans to leave the workforce to argue that the Obama administration has declared a war on Americans\u2019 work ethic.\nStill, that\u2019s not to say that social programs don\u2019t impact the labor force.\nAt the center of the conservative critique is the claim that programs like the Affordable Care Act decrease an individual\u2019s incentive to work.\n\u201cGet rid of that and tons of folks would be forced to go back to work.\u201d That, after all, is the logical endpoint to such claims.\nThe analysis is proof, they claim, of the president\u2019s campaign to push more Americans on the government dole, expand social programs, and ask the rest of us to finance their lives of leisure."}
