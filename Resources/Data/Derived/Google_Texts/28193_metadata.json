It was daybreak in Band-i-Timor, early December 2001, and hundreds of turbaned farmers sat pensively, weighing the choice before them. They had once been the backbone of the Taliban\u2019s support; the movement had arisen not far from here, and many had sent their sons to fight on the front lines. But in 2000, Mullah Omar had decreed opium cultivation to be un-Islamic, and whip-wielding police saw to it that production was halted almost overnight. Band-i-Timor had been poppy country for as long as anyone could remember, but now the fields lay fallow and children were going hungry. With the Taliban\u2019s days numbered after the U.S. invasion, the mood was ripe for a change. But could they trust the Americans? Or Hamid Karzai?\n\nAn enfeebled elder, Hajji Burget Khan, rose to speak. A legendary war hero and a chief of the millions-strong Ishaqzai tribe, Burget Khan commanded respect that few present could rival. \u201cHe was an inspiring leader,\u201d a tribal elder told me later, \u201cas pure as the rain falling from the sky.\u201d He was also a consummate pragmatist, having forged alliances over the years across the political spectrum, including with the Taliban. Now he was extolling the virtues of the coming American order. There would be jobs, he said, and there would be development. And, most important, farmers would be left alone to do the work they\u2019d always done.\n\nA second elder then addressed the audience. A generation younger and a few waist sizes larger than Burget Khan, Hajji Bashar was a leader of the politically important Noorzai tribe, a frontier tycoon who had made his millions smuggling opium. Like Burget Khan, he had a knack for backing the right horse \u2014 he was an early financier of the Taliban \u2014 and now he insisted that with American wealth and power on their side, the future had never looked brighter.\n\nFor the first time in years, hope took hold of the poor farmers of Band-i-Timor. The local Taliban council of religious clerics was declared null and void, and in its place the attendees formed a council composed of representatives from all Maiwand tribes. Hajji Bashar was elected governor of the district, prompting the former governor and police chief to flee overnight. It was, in effect, a bloodless coup, with the Taliban authority replaced by an America-friendly administration. Although Maiwand would have many governments in the decade to follow, only this one, farmers would say for years afterward, truly belonged to them.\n\nThe parched Maiwand desert began to show signs of life. Schools and clinics, long ignored and abandoned by the Taliban, reopened their doors. Aid workers arrived to repair water channels and irrigation systems. Step by step, elders worked to help the fledgling government stand on its own. Hajji Burget Khan persuaded hundreds of former Taliban foot soldiers to declare their allegiance to the Karzai government.\n\nIt was a move as old as the wars themselves: just as these men had once flocked to the Taliban, they would now, for sheer survival, throw their weight behind the new power. Hajji Bashar delivered to the Kandahar governor 15 truckloads of weapons, including hundreds of rocket launchers and anti-aircraft missiles, that he had collected from former Talibs. Bashar, in fact, harbored ambitions to become a national player and was quick to find his way to the Americans. He had initiated contact as early as November 2001 \u2014 when the Taliban was still in power \u2014 via clandestine meetings with U.S. officials.\n\nThen, in January 2002, he showed up at an American base and spent a few days telling officers everything he knew about the Taliban. His crowning achievement came the following month, when he helped convince erstwhile Taliban foreign minister and Maiwand native Mullah Mutawakkil to surrender to U.S. forces, making him one of the highest-ranking Talibs in American custody.\n\nThe Taliban Surrender\n\nIn fact, Mutawakkil\u2019s defection was only the latest in a rush of Taliban officials looking to switch allegiances. Within a month of its military collapse, the Taliban movement had ceased to exist. When religious clerics in Pakistan launched a fund-raising campaign to get the Taliban back on their feet and waging \u201cjihad\u201d against the Americans, it was roundly rejected by the Talib leadership. \u201cWe want to tell people the Taliban system is no more,\u201d Agha Jan Mutassim, finance minister of the fallen regime and Mullah Omar\u2019s confidant, told reporters. \u201cThey should not give any donations in the name of the Taliban.\u201d He added: \u201cIf a stable Islamic government is established in Afghanistan, we don\u2019t intend to launch any action against it.\u201d\n\nKhalid Pashtoon, spokesman for the new Kandahar government, declared: \u201cMinisters of the Taliban and senior Taliban are coming one by one and surrendering and joining with us.\u201d The list included the Taliban ministers of defense, justice, interior, vice and virtue, information, health, commerce, industry, and finance \u2014 in effect, the entire Taliban cabinet; key military commanders and important governors; diplomats; and top officials who had worked with Mullah Omar.\n\nThe avalanche of surrenders knew no bounds of ideology: leaders of the notorious whip-wielding religious police were among the earliest to defect. A group of former Taliban officials even announced that they were forming a political party to participate in future democratic elections. \u201cWe are giving advice to Hamid Karzai,\u201d said their leader. \u201cWe support him.\u201d\n\nBy surrendering, the Taliban were following the pattern that had marked Afghan politics for much of the previous two decades. After the Soviet withdrawal, many Afghan Communists had rebranded themselves as Islamists and joined the mujahedeen. During the civil war, factions shifted loyalties based on nothing more than bald pragmatism. Upon the Taliban\u2019s entry onto the scene, warlords across the Pashtun belt had either retired, fled, or joined them. Now it was the Taliban\u2019s turn, and as one member of the movement after another submitted to the authority of the Karzai administration, there emerged the possibility of a truly inclusive political order.\n\nIt had long been Karzai\u2019s desire to convene a loya jirga, a grand assembly of elders, to elect a transitional government. The idea took hold around the country. At Kandahar\u2019s soccer stadium (last used under the Taliban as an execution ground), thousands of farmers and dignitaries packed the stands to rally for the jirga. Delegates were to be drawn from each of the nation\u2019s three hundred-plus districts. In Maiwand, unsurprisingly, the revered Hajji Burget Khan was elected despite his advanced age. \u201cWe felt as if we were born anew,\u201d recalled Kala Khan, a fellow tribal elder. \u201cThere was nothing we couldn\u2019t accomplish.\u201d\n\nThe Americans Attack\n\nSpring washed over Band-i-Timor and the acacias bloomed and pomegranate groves grew thick, and for the first time in years the fields were lavender bright with poppies. Not far from the main river, overlooking those fields, stood a large quadrangle of mud buildings, with cars and jeeps parked out front and dozens of farmers milling about. This was the home of Hajji Burget Khan, who was busy day and night receiving Ishaqzai tribesmen from other districts, other provinces, even as far afield as Pakistan. They came to pay their respects to the octogenarian leader, and Abdullah, the family driver, would usually be dispatched to ferry them in from the bus stop.\n\nOne hot May night, Abdullah was sleeping in the courtyard when a thunderous blast shook him awake. Looking up, he saw a blinding white light in the space where the front gate had been. Silhouetted figures rushed toward him. He ran for the guesthouse, shouting that the house was under attack. Inside, Hajji Burget Khan was already awake; he had been sipping tea with visitors before the dawn prayer. His bodyguard Akhtar Muhammad raced into the courtyard, firing his weapon blindly. Before he knew it, he was thrown to the ground. Two or three men were on top of him. He was shackled and blindfolded, and he was kicked again and again. He heard shouting, in a language he couldn\u2019t understand.\n\nHajji Burget Khan and Hajji Tor Khan, Akhtar Muhammad\u2019s father, ran into the courtyard with other guests, heading for the main house. It was then, as the first morning light shaped the compound, that they saw armed men standing on the mud walls in camouflage uniforms and goggles and helmets. American soldiers. Gunfire erupted, and Hajji Tor Khan went down. Before Hajji Burget Khan could react, he, too, was shot.\n\nNearby, women huddled in their rooms, listening. Never before had strangers violated their home \u2014 not during the Russian occupation, or the civil war, or under the Taliban. A woman picked up a gun and headed into the courtyard to defend her family, but the soldiers wrested it out of her hands. Then a soldier appeared with an Afghan translator and ordered the women outside. It was the first time they had ever left their home without a mahrem. They were flexicuffed and had their feet shackled, and some were gagged with torn pieces of turban. The group was then herded into a dry well behind the compound. As the day broke and village farmers stepped out into the dawn air, the women\u2019s cries rang out across the fields and mud houses, never to be forgotten.\n\nThe soldiers stayed for hours. House by house throughout the village, men were pulled out and marched to an open field. There, Hajji Burget Khan lay clinging to life. Then he and the rest \u2014 55 of them in all, nearly the entire adult male population of the village \u2014 were loaded onto helicopters and trucks and taken away.\n\nCreating an Afghan Blackwater\n\nThe central thesis of the American failure in Afghanistan \u2014 the one you\u2019ll hear from politicians and pundits and even scholars \u2014 was succinctly propounded by Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage: \u201cThe war in Iraq drained resources from Afghanistan before things were under control.\u201d In this view, the American invasion of Iraq became a crucial distraction from stabilization efforts in Afghanistan, and in the resulting security vacuum the Taliban reasserted themselves.\n\nAt its core, the argument rests upon a key premise: that jihadi terrorism could be defeated through the military occupation of a country. That formulation seemed natural enough to many of us in the wake of 9/11. But travel through the southern Afghan countryside, and you will hear quite a different interpretation of what happened. It comes in snippets and flashes, in the stories people tell and their memories of the time, and it points to a contradiction buried deep in the war\u2019s basic premise.\n\nYou can find this contradiction embodied in a sprawling jumble of dust-blown hangars, barracks, and Burger Kings, a facility of barbed wire, gunmen, and internment cages: Kandahar Airfield, or KAF, as it came to be called, the nerve center for American operations in southern Afghanistan, home to elite units like the Navy SEALs and the Green Berets. A military base in a country like Afghanistan is also a web of relationships, a hub for the local economy, and a key player in the political ecosystem. Unravel how this base came to be, and you\u2019ll begin to understand how war returned to the fields of Maiwand.\n\nIn December 2001, an American Special Operations Forces unit pulled into an old Soviet airbase on the outskirts of Kandahar city. They were accompanied by a team of Afghan militiamen and their commander, a gregarious, grizzly bear of a man named Gul Agha Sherzai. An anti-Taliban warlord, Sherzai had shot to notoriety in the 1990s following the death of his illustrious father, Hajji Latif, a onetime bandit turned mujahed known as \u201cthe Lion of Kandahar.\u201d (Upon assuming his father\u2019s mantle, Gul Agha had rechristened himself Sherzai, Son of the Lion. His first name, incidentally, roughly translates as \u201cRespected Mr. Flower.\u201d) With American backing, Sherzai seized the airfield, then in ruins, and subsequently installed himself in the local governor\u2019s mansion \u2014 a move that incensed many, Hamid Karzai among them. Nonetheless, Sherzai brought a certain flair to the office, quickly catching notice for his fist-pounding speeches, tearful soliloquies, and outbursts of uncontrollable laughter, sometimes all in a single conversation.\n\nSherzai may not have had much experience in government, except a brief tenure as Kandahar\u2019s \u201cgovernor\u201d during the anarchic mid-1990s, but he knew a good business opportunity when he saw one. The airbase where the Americans were encamped was derelict and weedy, strewn with smashed furniture and seeded with land mines from the Soviet era. Early on, one of Sherzai\u2019s lieutenants met Master Sergeant Perry Toomer, a U.S. officer in charge of logistics and contracting. \u201cI started talking to him,\u201d Toomer said, \u201cand found out that they had a knowledge of how to get this place started.\u201d After touring the facilities, the Americans placed their first order: $325 in cash for a pair of Honda water pumps.\n\nIt would mark the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership. With Sherzai\u2019s services, the cracked and cratered airstrip blossomed into a massive, sprawling military base, home to one of the world\u2019s busiest airports. Kandahar Airfield would grow into a key hub in Washington\u2019s global war on terror, housing top-secret black-ops command rooms and large wire-mesh cages for terror suspects en route to the American prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.\n\nFor Sherzai, KAF would be only the beginning. In a few swift strokes, he made the desert bloom with American installations \u2014 and turned an extravagant profit in the process. He swiped land and rented it to U.S. forces to the tune of millions of dollars. Amid the ensuing construction boom, he seized gravel quarries, charging as much as $100 a load for what would normally have been an $8-a-load job. He furnished American troops with fuel for their trucks and workers for their projects, raking in commissions while functioning as an informal temp agency for his tribesmen.\n\nWith this windfall, he diversified into gasoline and water distribution, real estate, taxi services, mining, and, most lucrative of all, opium. No longer a mere governor, he was now one of the most powerful men in Afghanistan. Every morning, lines of supplicants would curl out of the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nAs his web of patronage grew, he began providing the Americans with hired guns, usually from his own Barakzai tribe \u2014 making him, in essence, a private security contractor, an Afghan Blackwater. And like the employees of that notorious American firm, Sherzai\u2019s gunmen lived largely outside the jurisdiction of any government. Even as Washington pumped in funds to create a national Afghan army and police, the U.S. military subsidized Sherzai\u2019s mercenaries, who owed their loyalty to the governor and the special forces alone. Some of his units could even be seen garbed in U.S. uniforms, driving heavily armed flatbed trucks through the streets of Kandahar.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Just as the U.S. threw its support behind the Taliban, officials have empowered a whole new set of Afghan warlords", "author": "Anand Gopal", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Just as the U.S. threw its support behind the Taliban, officials have empowered a whole new set of Afghan warlords", "title": "Dick Cheney\u2019s gift to the Middle East: How America created an Afghan Blackwater", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/12/dick_cheneys_gift_to_the_middle_east_how_america_created_an_afghan_blackwater_partner/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/dick_cheney4.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Just as the U.S. threw its support behind the Taliban, officials have empowered a whole new set of Afghan warlords", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/dick_cheney4.jpg", "title": "Dick Cheney\u2019s gift to the Middle East: How America created an Afghan Blackwater", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Dick Cheney\u2019s gift to the Middle East: How America created an Afghan Blackwater", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Hamid Karzai, Iraq, Middle East, Taliban, TomDispatch.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Hajji Burget Khan and Hajji Tor Khan, Akhtar Muhammad\u2019s father, ran into the courtyard with other guests, heading for the main house.\nInside, Hajji Burget Khan was already awake; he had been sipping tea with visitors before the dawn prayer.\nIn Maiwand, unsurprisingly, the revered Hajji Burget Khan was elected despite his advanced age.\nAn enfeebled elder, Hajji Burget Khan, rose to speak.\nHajji Burget Khan persuaded hundreds of former Taliban foot soldiers to declare their allegiance to the Karzai government."}
