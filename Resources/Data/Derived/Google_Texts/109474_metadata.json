As the cold front enters the mid-Atlantic late morning and passes through Monday afternoon, there\u2019s a 40% chance of additional scattered showers falling behind the front. Any precipitation should remain light and will taper off in time for the evening commute. There will be significant dry parts of the day, but an umbrella may be a practical accessory for those traveling about the region on foot.\n\nPeriods of clouds and sun will help the day\u2019s high temperature rise into the upper 60s along the coast and the lower 70s in northeast New Jersey and New York City. By evening, skies will start to clear and overnight lows will fall to around 40 in the Hudson River Valley and into the lower 50s most other places. A northwest wind at around 10 mph will serve as a chilly reminder that we\u2019ve begun our final descent into autumn.\n\nMonday\u2019s temperatures will be a few degrees below normal, making the day feel more like early October than mid-September. The good news is that we\u2019ll soon return to near normal temperatures, once a large area of Canadian high pressure moves into Greater New York on Tuesday. This will ensure a string of sunny days that should last until Thursday, with highs in the mid to upper 70s during the day and in lower 60s at night.\n\nMonday\u2019s Greater New York forecast roundup:\n\nWSJ Headquarters in Manhattan:\n\nActual High: 74; RealFeel High: 74\n\nActual Low: 54; RealFeel Low: 49\n\nWeather: Partly sunny, a few light showers\n\nBrooklyn: 73/51\n\nQueens: 73/54\n\nBronx: 72/52\n\nStaten Island: 72/54\n\nPoughkeepsie, N.Y.: 68/39\n\nTrenton, N.J.: 70/48\n\nIslip, Long Island: 71/50\n\nNew Haven, Conn.: 70/47\n\nRebecca Fowler is a science writer at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Greater New York begins the new week with cooler weather and clouds, but more pleasant days are ahead during this final week of summer.", "title": "Weather Journal: A Cold Final Week of Summer", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/15/weather-journal-a-cold-final-week-of-summer/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YX572_nyweat_G_20130915182153.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Weather Journal: A Cold Final Week of Summer", "description": "Greater New York begins the new week with cooler weather and clouds, but more pleasant days are ahead during this final week of summer.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Carrie Melago", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "Greater New York begins the new week with cooler weather and clouds, but more pleasant days are ahead during this final week of summer.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-15T22:23:02-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/15/weather-journal-a-cold-final-week-of-summer/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-18494", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Greater New York begins the new week with cooler weather and clouds, but more pleasant days are ahead during this final week of summer.", "title": "Weather Journal: A Cold Final Week of Summer", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2013/09/15/weather-journal-a-cold-final-week-of-summer/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YX572_nyweat_G_20130915182153.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-18494", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-15T22:23:13-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd276a\"", "article_summary": "By Rebecca FowlerGreater New York begins the new week with cooler weather and clouds, but more pleasant days are ahead during this final week of summer.\nA cold front approaching from the west brings a sprinkling of showers to the region prior to daybreak on Monday.\nA northwest wind at around 10 mph will serve as a chilly reminder that we\u2019ve begun our final descent into autumn.\nThis will ensure a string of sunny days that should last until Thursday, with highs in the mid to upper 70s during the day and in lower 60s at night.\nMonday\u2019s temperatures will be a few degrees below normal, making the day feel more like early October than mid-September."}
