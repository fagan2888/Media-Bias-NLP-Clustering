PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) — President Barack Obama is spending the holiday weekend in Southern California.

Obama arrived in Palm Springs on Saturday morning after flying in from San Francisco.

The president has no public events scheduled during his stay. He’s expected to spend most of his time playing golf, as he has on earlier visits to the area.

He traveled to California without his wife, Michelle, or their daughters.

Obama has been in California since Thursday evening. On Friday, he addressed a White House summit at Stanford University on cybersecurity and consumer protection.

Obama is supposed to return to Washington on Monday — Presidents Day, a federal holiday.
