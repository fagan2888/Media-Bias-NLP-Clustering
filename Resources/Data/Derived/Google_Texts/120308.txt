The statement came after the Philippines President Benigno Aquino met Widodo at the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur and appealed for "humanitarian consideration" in the case.

Widodo was sympathetic and was consulting with the Indonesian attorney general on the legal issues, he said.

"President Widodo promised to resume the conversation with President Aquino later today."
