The news in April that he was being dropped by WIBC in Indianapolis, a booming talk powerhouse that played home to Limbaugh\u2019s radio show for more than two decades, or the news this week that the talker\u2019s new address on the Indianapolis dial is going to be WNDE, a ratings doormat AM sports station that has so few listeners it trails the commercial-free classical music outlet in town?\n\nThe humbling, red-state tumble is just the latest setback for the conservative talker who has seen his once-golden career suffer a steady series of losses recently.\n\nDivorced from successful, longtime affiliates in places like New York, Los Angeles, Boston, and Indianapolis, Limbaugh\u2019s professional trajectory is heading downward. That\u2019s confirmed by the second and third-tier stations he now calls home in those important media markets, and the fact that when his show became available, general managers up and down the dial passed on it. Apparently turned off by the show\u2019s hefty price tag, sagging ratings, and disappearing advertisers, Limbaugh continues to be a very hard sell.\n\nIt\u2019s a precipitous fall from the glory days when the host posted huge ratings numbers, had affiliates clamoring to join his network, and dictated Republican politics. All of that seems increasingly distant now. With his comically inflated, $50 million-a-year syndication deal set to expire next year, Limbaugh\u2019s future seems uncertain. \u201cWho would even want someone whose audience is aging and is considered toxic to many advertisers,\u201d askedRadioInsight last month.\n\nFor Limbaugh, the troubles were marked by key events from 2012 and 2013. The first came in the form of Limbaugh\u2019s Sandra Fluke implosion, where he castigated and insulted for days the graduate student who testified before Congress about health care and access to contraception, calling her a \u201cslut\u201d and suggesting she post videos of herself having sex on the Internet. The astonishing monologues sparked an unprecedented advertiser exodus.\n\nThe following year, as the host struggled to hang on to fleeing sponsors, radio industry giant Cumulus Media decided to negotiate its Limbaugh contract in public, making it clear through the press that the company was willing to cut ties with the pricey host in major cities where Cumulus owned talk radio stations. In the end, Limbaugh stayed with Cumulus stations, but the company sent a clear signal to the industry: Limbaugh was no longer an untouchable and general managers weren\u2019t clamoring to hire him. Since then, the talker\u2019s fortunes have only faded.\n\nAnother looming problem? Conservative talk radio is a \u201cformat fewer advertisers are interested in buying because of its aging audience,\u201d noted radio consultant and self-identified Republican Darryl Parks. Limbaugh himself recently conceded a generational disconnect: \u201cNow that I\u2019ve outgrown the 25-54 demographic, I\u2019m no longer confident that the way I see the world is the way everybody else does.\u201d\n\nThat disconnect may be fueling Limbaugh\u2019s waning political influence. Once a mighty player whose ring wasconstantly kissed by Republicans, this campaign season seems to be unfolding with Limbaugh on the sidelines, his clout and his ability to drive the conversation seemingly surpassed by other conservative mediaplayers.\n\nHere\u2019s a perfect example. In April, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Halperin conducted an awkward interview with Republican presidential hopeful Sen. Ted Cruz, asking the Hispanic candidate about Cuban food and if he\u2019d answer at least one question in Spanish. Limbaugh immediately castigated Halperin\u2019s Q&A on his show, but nobody seemed to pay much attention to his complaints.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indianapolis' WIBC is just the latest station to drop him like a bad habit.
