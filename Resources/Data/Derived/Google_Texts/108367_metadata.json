Seriously?\" Heartland Computers owner Carl Bootsma said.\n\nThis is the second time in two months someone has thrown a large rock through the front door, smashed a display case and stolen thousands of dollars in electronics.\n\n\"They have no fear. Just throw it in and went straight for what they wanted. The video shows they were here for 20 seconds,\" Bootsma said.\n\nThe difference this time, however, is security cameras captured the crime.\n\n\"The police are excited for the video. Our displays lit up; so often with surveillance cameras, the images are black. With ours, since the displays are lit up, there's color. You can see color. What type of jacket he's wearing; the clothes he's wearing,\" Bootsma said.\n\nBootsma said he will post the video on Facebook and hopes someone will come forward with more information about the suspect. Whoever did this stole three iPads and two laptops worth $2,450, but Bootsma said the total cost is much more than what is on the price tag.\n\n\"We're a small local business. We're not some big store that can just write off this as an expense. I have insurance to cover this, but obviously my premium will go up,\" Bootsma said.\n\nMoving forward, Bootsma says he'll make some big changes to protect his store.\n\n\"You feel almost violated this happened again,\" Bootsma said.\n\nWatch video of the crime below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "KELOLAND News", "description": "Employees at Heartland Computers spent Monday morning sweeping up a pile of broken glass that collected underneath the large hole in the front door.", "title": "Store Owner Hopes Security Video Helps Catch Thief", "url": "http://www.keloland.com/news/article/news/store-owner-hopes-security-video-helps-catch-thief", "image": "http://assets.keloland.com/images/images/default-source/agriculture/crops/barley/52702.jpg?sfvrsn=0", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521498541203189}, "Generator": "Sitefinity 7.3.5630.0 PE", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Employees at Heartland Computers spent Monday morning sweeping up a pile of broken glass that collected underneath the large hole in the front door."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd257d\"", "article_summary": "What type of jacket he's wearing; the clothes he's wearing,\" Bootsma said.\nMoving forward, Bootsma says he'll make some big changes to protect his store.\nHeartland Computers owner Carl Bootsma said.\nOur displays lit up; so often with surveillance cameras, the images are black.\nBootsma said he will post the video on Facebook and hopes someone will come forward with more information about the suspect."}
