He\u2019s given us the effort on the defensive end. Night in and night out, he\u2019s had tough matchups,\u201d Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said of Chandler. \u201cBut a lot of times, the ball will get swung around to him and he\u2019s trying to make the extra pass.\n\n\u201cI want him to be a little bit more selfish on our offensive end because we rely on him in that position to produce points.\u201d\n\nThe return of point guard Ty Lawson should help Chandler get more open looks. Lawson, who has missed the past two games with a strained hamstring, practiced Thursday and is expected to play against the Utah Jazz on Friday night.\n\n\u201cBarring any setback from practice \u2026 I think he should be able to go,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nWhen Shaw spoke to Chandler before the Washington game, his advice was succinct: \u201cIf they give you any space out there on the floor, I want you to shoot the ball.\u201d\n\nChandler did a better job of taking that advice to heart, hoisting 10 shots and making seven. It was only the third time in the past nine games that he took 10 or more shots. In those games, he has been on the court a lot, an average of 29.8 minutes.\n\nShaw said Chandler, a small forward, isn\u2019t the kind of player for whom he will draw up a lot of plays, because he\u2019ll rely on the movement of the offense to create open looks. But a couple of weeks ago, Shaw asked Chandler what kind of actions he liked in order for him to get him the ball more. Chandler, who has never been a focal point on any offense, wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nShaw made a deal with Chandler that he would draw up some plays for him and then ask for feedback on what he liked. Shaw said on the recent road trip he drew up plays to get Chandler a shot early in each game, but he only took one shot.\n\nIt\u2019s Chandler\u2019s nature to be unselfish.\n\n\u201cThe coach tells you to take shots, and at the same time you don\u2019t want to take too many shots,\u201d Chandler said. \u201cTrying to still play team basketball and not trying to be focused on yourself. Sometimes it\u2019s kind of tough. You see a teammate open and wonder whether I should take this shot or if I should pass, and you kind of mess yourself up, your rhythm.\n\n\u201cThe last game, I just took the shots that were open and passed it when I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s at least a start.\n\n\u201cI want him to always carry the threat of a shot when the ball swings to him,\u201d Shaw said.\n\nUTAH AT DENVER\n\n7 p.m. Friday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Trey Burke: The overall record still isn\u2019t anything to write home about, but when Utah got the services of its lottery pick, point guard Burke, on Nov. 20, its competitiveness and competence on the court took a giant step forward. Burke missed the start of the season with a broken finger. Once healthy, he came off the bench for two games, then was inserted into the starting lineup. The Jazz won three of its past five games and is 4-9 with Burke starting, as opposed to 1-14 when he was relegated to watching.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nJazz: Former CU star Alec Burks has found his scoring touch over the past three games with an average of 18.7 points on sizzling 61.8 percent shooting. He\u2019s shooting 80 percent from the 3-point line in those three games. \u2026 This is the second of a two-game road trip for the Jazz, which started it with a win at Sacramento on Wednesday.\n\nNuggets: Nuggets guard Ty Lawson (hamstring) is hopeful of being able to play. \u2026 Guard Nate Robinson is the Nuggets\u2019 leading scorer over the past five games, averaging 14.0 points in that span. \u2026 Andre Miller has been a mixed bag in his two starts in place of Lawson, keeping things steady from an execution perspective but struggling to shoot with averages of 5.5 points on 21.4 percent shooting in those games.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets\u2019 Wilson Chandler gets green light to shoot more often", "title": "Nuggets\u2019 Wilson Chandler gets green light to shoot more often", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/12/nuggets-wilson-chandler-gets-green-light-to-shoot-more-often/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131123__wilson-chandlerp1.jpg", "height": 506}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131123__wilson-chandlerp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2013-12-12T21:24:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T15:23:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbace\"", "article_summary": "Nuggets: Nuggets guard Ty Lawson (hamstring) is hopeful of being able to play.\n\u201cThe coach tells you to take shots, and at the same time you don\u2019t want to take too many shots,\u201d Chandler said.\nNight in and night out, he\u2019s had tough matchups,\u201d Nuggets coach Brian Shaw said of Chandler.\n\u2026 Guard Nate Robinson is the Nuggets\u2019 leading scorer over the past five games, averaging 14.0 points in that span.\nIt was only the third time in the past nine games that he took 10 or more shots."}
