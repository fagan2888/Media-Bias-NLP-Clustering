Consumers could use this information to figure out, for instance, if there is an acceptable alternative product that has less or no added sugar.\n\nWhen it\u2019s all said and done, consumers do better with more information, clearly presented, so they can make smart choices.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Better nutrition labels, smarter choices", "title": "Better nutrition labels, smarter choices", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/07/03/better-nutrition-labels-smarter-choices/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140703__OP07LABELSp1.jpg", "height": 376}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140703__OP07LABELSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-03T16:08:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T11:17:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdaf2c\"", "article_summary": "If you\u2019re like many Americans, a half cup of ice cream just isn\u2019t going to cut it when it comes to indulgences.\nFood industry groups have objected to the added sugar designation, saying added sugar often is chemically identical to sugar already in a product, so differentiation is not helpful.\nWhen it\u2019s all said and done, consumers do better with more information, clearly presented, so they can make smart choices.\nThat\u2019s the standard serving size ice cream companies must cite on labels meant to inform consumers how many calories they\u2019re consuming and the nutrient content of the treat.\nConsumers could use this information to figure out, for instance, if there is an acceptable alternative product that has less or no added sugar."}
