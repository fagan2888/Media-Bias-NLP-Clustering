Frederick Douglass, for one, repeatedly observed that the central question was less about \u201cthe Negro\u201d than about the United States of America and what sort of country it would turn out to be. As white abolitionist Leonard Marsh put it, what his fellow citizens really wanted to know about black people was \u201cHow will their freedom affect us?\u201d\n\nWhite Americans have arguably never gotten past those questions; I keep waiting for somebody on Fox News to revert to the various \u201ccolonization\u201d schemes of the 19th century, aka \u201cSend them back to Africa.\u201d (Lincoln himself believed, for most of his political career, that white racism could never be overcome and that African-Americans, once freed from slavery, would be better off somewhere else.) But the question we\u2019re stuck on in 2015 is a different, albeit related one. All day long, on every news site and every cable TV talk show, we get endless iterations of \u201cWhat shall we do with the Muslim?\u201d\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s campaign was viewed, a few short weeks ago, as having gone into a terminal nosedive. Now Trump has risen to a glorious new apogee, thanks largely to the Paris attacks, the Syrian refugee crisis and most recently the theoretical terrorist links of the San Bernardino shooters. Trump has relentlessly flogged the Republican Party toward the most extreme version of the \u201cMuslim question,\u201d and the most extreme answers. Trump has only halfway retracted his bold suggestions that mosques should be closed down and American Muslims should be compelled to register in a national database; he has refused to retreat from his claims that \u201cthousands of Muslims\u201d in America celebrated the fall of the Twin Towers on 9/11, despite a total absence of evidence. The only reasons he has not proposed that Muslims should wear identifying emblems on their clothing are A) in the age of microchip technology and universal surveillance that really isn\u2019t necessary and B) somebody informed him at some point that that idea has an unsavory history. But, you know \u2013 the trains ran on time!\n\nTo be a viable Republican candidate at all in 2016, you have to go most of the way toward the Trumpian position of limitless and full-throated paranoia, as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have done. We must seal ourselves off against the hordes of Muslim invaders purely as a matter of survival, and given the sleeper cells no doubt embedded in every American village and town, not to mention the eagerness of Barack Hussein Obama and the entire Democratic Party to surrender the nation to Sharia rule, unlimited (if undisclosed) budget increases for the military-intelligence matrix are the least we can do. But Cruz and Rubio judiciously decline to support 24/7 Muslim-monitoring, or a coast-to-coast re-enactment of Kristallnacht. Because: Small government! We have reached a truly pathetic state when Jeb Bush, the sad clown of the 2016 race, and unreconstructed neocon warmonger Lindsey Graham (the happy clown, I guess) come off like vaguely reasonable human beings.\n\nJustifiable as it is to blame the white-rage contact high of the Republican presidential campaign for our national game of \u201cWhat shall we do with the Muslim?\u201d the contagion has spread more widely than that. Even before this week\u2019s mass shooting in San Bernardino had any clear link to Islamic extremism \u2013 which is not to say the nature of that link is clear now \u2013 we heard Sean Hannity darkly murmuring that the suspects did not have \u201cnormal-sounding\u201d names. Hannity spouts bigotry and spreads intolerance for a living, to be sure. But even by Fox News standards, that offhand remark revealed complicated layers of assumption and prejudice that I suspect are widely shared by the general public, at least out in Fox-viewing Whitelandia.\n\nCertain names are by definition not \u201cnormal,\u201d even in an era when the United States has absorbed all kinds of unpronounceable surnames in Hmong or Kurdish or Bengali, and when there are at least 3 million Muslim citizens. Furthermore, the specific nature of the non-normal name altered the essential character of the crime. If the San Bernardino shootings had been carried out by a white man named John Smith, he would be considered a lone nut even if he were a whacked-out evangelical Christian who thought he was doing the Lord\u2019s work. But if Syed Farook is a crazy Muslim dude who looked at crazy Muslim websites, then he winds up on the front page of the New York Post as a \u201cMUSLIM KILLER\u201d who represents the tip of a deadly iceberg of terror, and cannot possibly be a lone nut.\n\nFourteen years after George W. Bush assured us that we were not at war with Islam, it has become entirely normal for mainstream politicians and media commentators to suggest that, in effect, we are. Hannity\u2019s Fox colleague Jeanine Pirro, a New York suburbanite who identifies as a moderate Republican, said on Thursday that since Farook and his wife \u201clooked like Muslims\u201d and were seen carrying boxes into their house, the only possible reason the neighbors didn\u2019t call the cops was a desire to avoid being \u201cpolitically incorrect.\u201d Pirro has been a judge and a district attorney; she is supposed to know the law. Her clear implication is that Muslims, or people who look like Muslims, are not entitled to the same zone of privacy as the rest of us, and are inherently more likely to be carrying boxes full of bomb-making materials than, say, bowling balls or KitchenAid mixers. (I don\u2019t even know what to say about the fact that Pirro is of Lebanese ancestry, and presumably knows that Muslims come in all colors and dress in different ways.)\n\nBut honestly, how far is the blatant fear-mongering of Pirro and Hannity and Trump \u2013 the assumption that Muslims are guilty of terrorism or terrorist sympathies until proven innocent, and the corollary assumption that they cannot really be innocent, because they are Muslims \u2013 from the more sensible-sounding, \u201cliberal\u201d species of fear-mongering promulgated by Bill Maher and Sam Harris? Before the blood was dry or the killers had been identified in San Bernardino, Maher was sternly tweeting that we must not compare mass shooters with terrorists because the latter were far more dangerous, for reasons he declined to elucidate.\n\nThose guys are complicated public figures, and their views are not identical, on Islam or anything else. They would hasten to assure us that they know most Muslims are not terrorists, and they steer well clear of Trump\u2019s brand of National Socialism Lite. They don\u2019t want concentration camps, or a national registry. They are practical-minded, hardheaded citizens who see the need for prudence and vigilance in defense of democracy. They are saddened by the fact that their fellow liberals don\u2019t understand the gravity of the danger.", "article_metadata": {"description": "From Trump to Fox News to Bill Maher, the forces of anti-Muslim panic and paranoia are having a glorious year", "title": "Muslim fever goes viral: After Paris and San Bernardino, Islam-bashing is back and bigger than ever", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "From Trump to Fox News to Bill Maher, the forces of anti-Muslim panic and paranoia are having a glorious year", "title": "Muslim fever goes viral: After Paris and San Bernardino, Islam-bashing is back and bigger than ever", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/12/05/muslim_fever_goes_viral_after_paris_and_san_bernardino_islam_bashing_is_back_and_bigger_than_ever/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/maher_trump_nypost.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "From Trump to Fox News to Bill Maher, the forces of anti-Muslim panic and paranoia are having a glorious year", "title": "Muslim fever goes viral: After Paris and San Bernardino, Islam-bashing is back and bigger than ever", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/12/maher_trump_nypost.jpg", "creator": "@andohehir", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Andrew O'Hehir", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Anti-Islam, anti-muslim, anti-muslim bigotry, Atheism, Bill Maher, Donald Trump, Editor's Picks, isis, Islam, Islamic Extremism, islamic terrorism, Islamophobia, New Atheism, Paris Attacks, Sam Harris, san bernardino, san bernardino shooting, Terrorism", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Trump has relentlessly flogged the Republican Party toward the most extreme version of the \u201cMuslim question,\u201d and the most extreme answers.\nNow Trump has risen to a glorious new apogee, thanks largely to the Paris attacks, the Syrian refugee crisis and most recently the theoretical terrorist links of the San Bernardino shooters.\nIf the San Bernardino shootings had been carried out by a white man named John Smith, he would be considered a lone nut even if he were a whacked-out evangelical Christian who thought he was doing the Lord\u2019s work.\nBefore the blood was dry or the killers had been identified in San Bernardino, Maher was sternly tweeting that we must not compare mass shooters with terrorists because the latter were far more dangerous, for reasons he declined to elucidate.\nEven before this week\u2019s mass shooting in San Bernardino had any clear link to Islamic extremism \u2013 which is not to say the nature of that link is clear now \u2013 we heard Sean Hannity darkly murmuring that the suspects did not have \u201cnormal-sounding\u201d names."}
