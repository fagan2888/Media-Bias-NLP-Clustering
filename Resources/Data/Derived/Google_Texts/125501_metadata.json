The good news? \u201cThe children [of those families] showed signs of accelerated intellectual development without any harm to the important sexual identification that develops during the first years of life,\u201d the reviewer, Ari Goldman, wrote. Sadly though, \u201call the families endured criticism about the arrangement they chose\u2014from grandparents, employers, friends and even from the other parents in the playground.\u201d\n\nOne of the stay-at-home fathers in the study said the police once paid him a visit in response to a neighbor\u2019s report that \u201ca man is \u2018keeping\u2019 a young child in the apartment.\u201d\n\nPew Research Center\n\nFortunately, times are changing. Moms still make up the vast majority of stay-at-home parents, but fathers represent a growing share, according to a new Pew survey. In 2012, 16 percent of stay-at-home parents were dads, up from just 10 percent in 1989.\n\nThat\u2019s a somewhat positive storyline, but these dads\u2019 reasons for being at home aren\u2019t as uplifting. There has been a big jump in the number of fathers who say they\u2019re at home primarily to take care of their families\u2014 it\u2019s now 21 percent, compared to 5 percent in 1989. But Pew adds:\n\nStill, the largest share of stay-at-home fathers (35 percent) is at home due to illness or disability. This is in sharp contrast to stay-at-home mothers, most of whom (73 percent) report that they are home specifically to care for their home or family; just 11 percent are home due to their own illness or disability.\n\nIn other words, mothers are still more likely to stay at home because they think it\u2019s the best way to raise the kids; fathers are more likely to do it because they physically can\u2019t work outside the home.", "article_metadata": {"description": "There are more dads taking care of their kids now, but most are at home because they have few other options.", "author": "Olga Khazan", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "There are more dads taking care of their kids now, but most are at home because they have few other options.", "title": "Moms Stay at Home Because They Want to; Dads Do it When They Have No Choice", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2014/06/2350924315_cbd8a0f473_b/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/06/the-rise-of-the-poor-stay-at-home-dad/372227/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/olgakhazan"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2c05\"", "article_summary": "In 1987, the New York Times wrote a review about a book that followed 17 families with stay-at-home dads for five years.\nIn 2012, 16 percent of stay-at-home parents were dads, up from just 10 percent in 1989.\nBut Pew adds:Still, the largest share of stay-at-home fathers (35 percent) is at home due to illness or disability.\nMoms still make up the vast majority of stay-at-home parents, but fathers represent a growing share, according to a new Pew survey.\nThat\u2019s a somewhat positive storyline, but these dads\u2019 reasons for being at home aren\u2019t as uplifting."}
