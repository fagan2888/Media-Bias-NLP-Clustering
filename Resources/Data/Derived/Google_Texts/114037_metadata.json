Negative zero-point-eight percent\u2014yes, a slight decline.\n\nTo appreciate what that means, consider what the market for buying insurance on your own (rather than through an employer) was like before Obamacare came along. Between 2008 and 2010, premiums went up every year and they did so by at least 10 percent, according to an analysis that MIT economist Jonathan Gruber did for the Commonwealth Fund. And that was for insurance that might be sold only to healthy people or that had benefits far skimpier than the ones required by the Affordable Care Act. \u201cThere is variation, but so far, premium increases in year two of the Affordable Care Act are generally modest,\u201d Drew Altman, Kaiser\u2019s President and CEO, said in a press release. \u201cDouble digit premium increases in this market were not uncommon in the past.\u201d\n\nLarry Levitt, Kaiser's senior vice president and a co-author of the report, was a bit more colorful on twitter:\n\nCompetition driving ACA benchmark premiums down in many places. In health care, it's like defying the law of physics. http://t.co/OJPrYIGOzG \u2014 Larry Levitt (@larry_levitt) September 5, 2014\n\nKeep in mind that, last spring, critics of the Affordable Care Act predicted that premiums would skyrocket this year\u2014and many of the law's defenders feared that those critics were right. The theory was straightforward and plausible: Too many older and sicker people had signed up for coverage through the new marketplaces, without enough younger and healthier people to balance them out. Insurers, saddled with more medical bills than they had expected to pay out, would jack up their rates.\n\nSeveral months later, it would appear those predictions were wrong. Maybe insurers anticipated the mix of enrollees pretty well. Maybe they are deliberately underbidding, even now, just to gobble up market share. Maybe some combination of competition and regulation is forcing them to keep down prices. It could be any of these factors or some combination of them. Whatever the reason, it's good news for now.\n\nThe clearest winner in all of this, by the way, isn\u2019t necessarily the people buying insurance. Those tax subsidies in the Obamacare marketplaces effectively discount the price of insurance for most people buying it, insulating them from price increases. But the subsidies aren't free. They come from the government, which means they come from the taxpayers. If premiums aren't as high as expected, then the taxpayers are getting some relief.\n\nAre there caveats? Yes and they are important. The researchers picked 16 cities in states (plus the District of Columbia) where they could get final or near-final information on prices for next year. It's possible that a more comprehensive review including the rest of the country would turn up different numbers. In addition, premiums in the bronze plans, which are cheaper and less generous, are increasing by 3 percent\u2014still not very much, by historical standards, but it's not as impressive as what's happening with the second-cheapest silver plans.\n\nHistory matters, too. Obamacare critics will point out that premiums in most markets went up substantially last year, the law's first year of implementation, because insurers had to upgrade old plans to comply with the law's regulations on benefits and pricing. That's true. The law's tax credits partly or completely offset that increase for most people, and the law's goal was always to stabilize premiums after that shift. But the underlying sticker prices definitely increased last year.\n\nCritics will also note that Obama, as a candidate and during the early months of his presidency, famously boasted that insurance premiums would come down by $2500. That hasn't happened, although the Affordable Care Act does seem to be reducing overall health spending relative to previous expectations.\n\nThe other caveat is really a warning for consumers. In many markets, the second-cheapest plan is changing from 2014 to 2015, either because new insurers are under-bidding the older ones, or because carriers that charged high premiums last year decided to cut prices this year. Los Angeles is one such place. This year, the second cheapest plan comes from Blue Shield. Next year, it will be Anthem. A consumer who switches from that Blue Shield plan to the Anthem plan might realize savings. A consumer who stays with the Blue Shield could actually have to pay more.\n\n\u201cThis is great news for taxpayers, with competition driving down the cost of premium subsidies,\u201d Levitt told me. \u201cFor consumers, competition is messier. There will be lower-cost plans available, but people need to be prepared to shop for the best deal if they want to avoid a premium hike.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s confusing, I know. And you can safely assume that not all consumers are going to understand this. It\u2019s going to cause real problems come open enrollment time, particularly since some people will choose to re-enroll in their current plans automatically. But this is the way competition works, for better or worse or (I would argue) some of both. Plans are fighting to claim market share, sometimes by using low prices to lure customers. Beneficiaries who know how to take advantage of this can save themselves some money Those who don\u2019t understand the dynamics could get stuck with bigger bills.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "New report shows prices falling in some places, but there's a catch", "og": {"site_name": "New Republic", "description": "Quite possibly\u2014but there's a catch", "title": "Did Obamacare Make Insurance Cheaper In Your City?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/72899efb39c652ccd343d9b194f0ad48630721ac.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "url": "https://newrepublic.com/article/119329/kaiser-study-obamacare-premiums-rates-decline-some-cities", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/72899efb39c652ccd343d9b194f0ad48630721ac.jpeg?w=1024&h=512&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "title": "Did Obamacare Make Insurance Cheaper In Your City?", "site": "@newrepublic", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Quite possibly\u2014but there's a catch"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "parsely-metadata": "{\"thumb_image\":\"http://images.newrepublic.com/72899efb39c652ccd343d9b194f0ad48630721ac.jpeg\"}", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Is Obamacare Making Insurance Cheaper In Your City?\",\"link\":\"https://newrepublic.com/article/119329/kaiser-study-obamacare-premiums-rates-decline-some-cities\",\"section\":\"Obamacare\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-09-05T13:55:00.000Z\",\"post_id\":119329,\"author\":\"Jonathan Cohn\",\"type\":\"post\",\"tags\":[\"Obamacare\",\"Politics\",\"QED\",\"Affordable Care Act\",\"premiums\",\"Kaiser Family Foundation\",\"subsidies\",\"Regulations\",\"Anthem\",\"Blue Shield\",\"Blue Cross\",\"Denver\",\"Nashville\",\"Detroit\",\"Los Angeles\",\"New York\",\"Hartford\",\"Seattle\",\"Las Vegas\",\"Burlington\",\"Baltimore\",\"-type_article\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 4404589, "pages": 161419311535, "app_id": 1675346479369918}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//assets.newrepublic.com/assets/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thenewrepublic", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2014-09-05"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb1fc\"", "article_summary": "Critics will also note that Obama, as a candidate and during the early months of his presidency, famously boasted that insurance premiums would come down by $2500.\nInsurers, saddled with more medical bills than they had expected to pay out, would jack up their rates.\nTo appreciate what that means, consider what the market for buying insurance on your own (rather than through an employer) was like before Obamacare came along.\nThose tax subsidies in the Obamacare marketplaces effectively discount the price of insurance for most people buying it, insulating them from price increases.\nThe law's tax credits partly or completely offset that increase for most people, and the law's goal was always to stabilize premiums after that shift."}
