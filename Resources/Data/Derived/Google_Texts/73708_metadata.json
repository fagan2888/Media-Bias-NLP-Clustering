Accordingly, she said, Vista members may be required to pay a tax penalty if they do not have other coverage and do not receive an exemption.\n\nThe impact on community service workers is another unanticipated consequence of the health care law, which is making coverage available at little or no cost to many uninsured people but disrupting coverage for others who already had it.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbby Grosslein, a Vista member in New Orleans, said she thought it was strange that the health benefits provided by a federal agency did not meet the standards of a law adopted more than three and a half years ago. \u201cIt would be nice if the government waived the penalty because we are a federally funded program,\u201d said Ms. Grosslein, 24, who is completing her third year of service with AmeriCorps. \u201cIt\u2019s as if the right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.\u201d\n\nMoreover, she said: \u201cThe Affordable Care Act has been on the books since 2010. Why are we hearing only now that our health plan is not compliant?\u201d\n\nThousands of private employers and state and local government agencies have revamped their employee health plans to meet the law\u2019s requirements. But AmeriCorps says that its members are technically not employees, and that it does not have to provide them with the \u201cminimum essential coverage\u201d they need to comply with the individual mandate. \u201cThere will be no changes to the AmeriCorps Health Care Benefits Plan,\u201d Ms. Strasser wrote.\n\nVista, or Volunteers in Service to America, was proposed by President John F. Kennedy in 1963, authorized by Congress in 1964 and folded into the AmeriCorps network of programs in 1993. Its members work in education, housing, jobs and social service programs.\n\nPresident Obama \u2014 a onetime community organizer \u2014 is a big supporter, and he has called public service \u201ca central cause\u201d of his administration. In March, the White House said that \u201cAmeriCorps may be one of America\u2019s best assets,\u201d transforming communities every day.\n\nRick Christman of Lexington, Ky., a former member of the board of AmeriCorps\u2019 parent organization, the Corporation for National and Community Service, said no one expected that Vista workers would be subject to penalties because their health coverage was inadequate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Mr. Christman said.\n\nSamantha Jo Warfield, a spokeswoman for the agency, said AmeriCorps members had several options: They can keep their current coverage; they can shop for coverage on the new insurance exchanges, including HealthCare.gov; and if they are under 26, they may be able to stay on their parents\u2019 insurance. In addition, some might be eligible for Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people, which is being expanded in about half the states.\n\nAmeriCorps members say their existing coverage, which pays for doctors\u2019 services, hospital care and prescription drugs, meets most of their needs. However, according to the members\u2019 handbook, \u201cAmeriCorps does not provide benefits for any diagnosis that is considered a pre-existing condition,\u201d and the coverage for preventive care appears to be less than the law requires.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nSarah L. Sklaw, a 22-year-old Vista member from New York City, said: \u201cI really support the Affordable Care Act, and I don\u2019t want to be a naysayer. But it was surprising and frustrating to be told that our health coverage would not meet the law\u2019s standards, especially because the Corporation for National and Community Service told us at orientation in August that we did not need to worry about the issue.\u201d\n\nOther AmeriCorps members said they occasionally needed more extensive coverage to pay for treatment of pre-existing conditions or injuries requiring specialty care, and they noted that some members did dangerous work, such as fighting wildfires or building trails on steep mountains.\n\nThe AmeriCorps health plan is available at no cost to members of Vista and the National Civilian Community Corps, a residential program for young men and women, who help build homes, tutor children and provide disaster relief and other services.\n\nVista officials said that some members might qualify for exemptions from the individual mandate penalty because of their low incomes. Vista members receive allowances to cover the cost of food, housing and other basic necessities. But the amounts are low because members are expected to live at approximately the same economic level as those they serve.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20131226212506, "twitter": {"description": "Members of the community service program AmeriCorps have been told that their government-provided insurance did not meet the requirements of the new health law.", "title": "Vista Workers Told Their U.S. Health Plan Fails Test", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/27/us/vista-workers-told-their-us-health-plan-fails-test.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002622141"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/27/us/HEALTH/HEALTH-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/27/us/vista-workers-told-their-us-health-plan-fails-test.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000002622141", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/27/us/vista-workers-told-their-us-health-plan-fails-test.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us", "hdl_p": "Vista Workers Told Their U.S. Health Plan Fails Test", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "Dec. 26, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "article": {"author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/robert_pear/index.html", "section_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/pages/national/index.html", "section": "U.S.", "modified": "2014-07-18", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/us/index.jsonp", "tag": "Corp for National and Community Service", "published": "2013-12-26", "section-taxonomy-id": "23FD6C8B-62D5-4CEA-A331-6C2A9A1223BE"}, "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Health Insurance and Managed Care,Americorps,Corp for National and Community Service", "description": "Members of the community service program AmeriCorps have been told that their government-provided insurance did not meet the requirements of the new health law.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Robert Pear", "thumbnail_150": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/27/us/HEALTH/HEALTH-thumbLarge.jpg", "sourceApp": "nyt-v5", "slug": "27health", "byl": "By ROBERT PEAR", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "usageTerms": "http://www.nytimes.com/content/help/rights/sale/terms-of-sale.html", "lp": "Members of the community service program AmeriCorps have been told that their government-provided insurance did not meet the requirements of the new health law.", "tom": "News", "dfp-amazon-enabled": "false", "thumbnail": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/27/us/HEALTH/HEALTH-thumbStandard.jpg", "news_keywords": "AmeriCorps", "CG": "us", "robots": "noarchive", "dat": "Dec. 26, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com", "genre": "News", "org": "Corp for National and Community Service", "thumbnail_height": 75, "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "utime": 20140718071007, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/27/us/vista-workers-told-their-us-health-plan-fails-test.html", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/27/us/HEALTH/HEALTH-videoSixteenByNine1050.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Members of the community service program AmeriCorps have been told that their government-provided insurance did not meet the requirements of the new health law.", "title": "Vista Workers Told Their U.S. Health Plan Fails Test"}, "pdate": 20131226, "des": "Health Insurance and Managed Care", "articleid": 100000002622141, "cre": "The New York Times", "hdl": "Vista Workers Told Their U.S. Health Plan Fails Test", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf41c\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThere will be no changes to the AmeriCorps Health Care Benefits Plan,\u201d Ms. Strasser wrote.\nMary Strasser, the director of AmeriCorps\u2019 Vista program, described the changes in a bulletin to members on Dec. 16.\nVista members receive allowances to cover the cost of food, housing and other basic necessities.\nThe notice has surprised and worried workers in AmeriCorps, the federal community service program that is often described as a domestic version of the Peace Corps.\nAccordingly, she said, Vista members may be required to pay a tax penalty if they do not have other coverage and do not receive an exemption."}
