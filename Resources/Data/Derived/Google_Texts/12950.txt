Tech: Touch Tonic for Gloves, $20

You don’t need to buy a special pair of gloves, or cut the fingers off your existing ones, to be able to use your phone during winter. Applying this liquid to your gloves will let you manage your touchscreen without freezing your fingers. (The makers warn the liquid isn’t completely clear so is best used on dark gloves.)
