WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) - The Force is strong at the Worcester Art Museum.

The museum is holding a Star Wars community day on Saturday at which visitors of all ages are invited to come dressed as their favorite Star Wars character.

Activities include crafts projects in which participants can make Yoda ears or their own movie poster.

Jedi light saber demos are planned throughout the day.

Events also include an exploration of the wonders of armor, both real and mythical in the museum’s Knights exhibition, with a comparison between an Imperial Stormtrooper’s armor and the armor of a medieval knight.

All the activities come included in the regular price of admission.
