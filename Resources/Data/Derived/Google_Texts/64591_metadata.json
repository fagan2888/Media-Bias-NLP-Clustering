Thursday\u2019s rollout serves as a closing argument that enough has been done to help the grouse and that it no longer needs to be included on a federal watch list.\n\nAsked specifically about the Fish and Wildlife decision, Vilsack was circumspect. \u201cI\u2019m going to stay in my lane,\u201d he said.\n\nBut he touted the success of the USDA\u2019s Sage Grouse Initiative as one way to improve the bird\u2019s chances of survival \u2014 as well as spare Western landowners from potentially onerous regulations.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s had an impact on the bird,\u201d he said. The USDA program is \u201cthe best of all worlds: better habitat, better protection and better assurance for producers.\u201d\n\nSince its launch in 2010, the Sage Grouse Initiative has partnered with more than 1,100 ranches across 11 Western states to help conserve an estimated 4.4 million acres of land, according to the agency. It spent nearly $300 million through 2014.\n\nBut significant questions remain about the overall health of the grouse, which Fish and Wildlife in 2010 decided was worrisome enough to include on a list of animals that needed protection, but was not in so much danger that the bird needed to leap ahead of other species to get priority.\n\nAgency officials now have two options: keep the grouse on its watch list or make the call that conservation efforts have been sufficient.\n\nWhat is not on the table, however, is the possibility of listing the bird as threatened or endangered, prompting new regulations on how landowners must deal with it.\n\nCongress expressly forbid Fish and Wildlife from taking either step in legislation it passed last year, although the ban was temporary.\n\nFor its part, Fish and Wildlife has recognized the ongoing effort to save the grouse.\n\n\u201cThere has been a tremendous amount of conservation done between 2010 and 2015 at the federal, state and private level,\u201d said agency spokesman Theo Stein.\n\nBut he said next month\u2019s decision would hinge on the overall status of the grouse and its sagebrush habitat, as well as whether there were adequate regulatory protections for the bird.\n\n\u201cThis is an ice-age bird that got run over by the 20th century,\u201d Stein said.\n\nTwo studies this year have come to different conclusions on the health of the greater sage grouse.\n\nLast spring, a survey commissioned by the Pew Charitable Trusts found the bird had experienced a 56 percent drop in breeding males in 2013, to 48,641 from 109,990 in 2007.\n\n\u201cConcerted efforts across both public and private land ownerships that are intended to benefit Greater Sage-Grouse show little current evidence of success but more will be required to stabilize these declining populations,\u201d wrote the study\u2019s authors.\n\nBut a report this month by the Western Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, which represents U.S. and Canadian departments from across the region, found the number of male birds had rebounded significantly from a recent low in 2013.\n\n\u201cThis latest report shows sage grouse populations are still doing well across much of their range,\u201d Virgil Moore, director of Idaho Fish and Game, said in a statement.\n\nThe dueling reports reflect, in some sense, the divisiveness of the issue and the tough decision ahead for Fish and Wildlife officials.\n\nErik Molvar, with the environmental group WildEarth Guardians, said the uncertainty was one argument in favor of keeping a federal eye on the bird.\n\nIt\u2019s the wrong approach to see how little can be done to \u201cprotect the sage grouse and get away with it,\u201d he said. Instead, regulators should seek a \u201cbalance between human activities and corporate profits and (also) sage grouse survival.\u201d\n\nMark K.
