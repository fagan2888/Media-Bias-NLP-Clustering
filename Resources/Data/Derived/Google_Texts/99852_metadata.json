Trump also doubled down on his criticisms of George W. Bush\u2019s national security record.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to cut spending bigly,\u201d Trump said, explaining how he will also increase revenues in order to bring down the debt. \u201cI\u2019m going to cut taxes. We\u2019re going to bring jobs back and have a dynamic economy\u2026We\u2019re going to cut tremendous amounts of money.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a great temperament,\u201d Trump said in the town hall, in which he pushed back on the image created in the last debate and in recent headlines that he is spinning out of control in his fight with Ted Cruz. Trump pointed out how Cruz\u2019s quasi-filibuster against Obamacare and the government shutdown did not actually kill Obamacare.\n\n\u201cI think I will set myself apart because my policies are better\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m a better leader,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou look at a guy like Ted Cruz, he\u2019s a nasty guy\u2026not one senator has endorsed him \u2026To stand in front of the Senate for two days and have everyone laugh at you and get nothing? He accomplished nothing with that.\u201d\n\nTrump noted that he can win New York in the general election, that he has a \u201cgreat chance at Michigan,\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll definitely get Pennsylvania. I\u2019ll get Ohio\u201d and will probably win Iowa and other Midwestern purple states. Trump again took on Republican orthodoxy by pushing for the ability to negotiate drug prices \u2014 something he can pass since he\u2019s not taking money from the drug companies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the largest drug buyer in the world. We don\u2019t negotiate,\u201d Trump complained. \u201cWe\u2019d save 300 billion dollars a year\u2026These candidates are all controlled by the drug companies\u2026There\u2019s tremendous fat in our budgets\u2026The candidates are all controlled by the people with money.\u201d Trump outright refused to raise the retirement age for Social Security, pledging to cut enough money in the budget elsewhere to save the program.\n\nTrump went to his ace in the hole in South Carolina, trade, and explained how Mexico will effectively pay for his border wall.\n\n\u201cOur trade agreements are a disaster. TPP is a disaster because they don\u2019t talk about monetary manipulation or devaluation\u2026Our trade agreements will be fully re-negotiated by me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a trade deficit this year with Mexico of 58 billion dollars,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAs soon as I start playing with that trade deficit, they are going to pay for the wall\u2026we have all the cards.\u201d\n\nTrump pledged to help students lower the cost of higher education and gave special attention to a question about how he will help African-Americans through private sector methods. Trump said:\n\nI have to say right now, we have an African-American president, and we have African-American youth unemployment at 58 percent, maybe even higher\u2026..I see nothing but problems. Barack Obama has done nothing economically for African-Americans\u2026We\u2019re going to bring back our jobs from China, we\u2019re bringing them back from Mexico\u2026Number one, we have to get rid of rules and regulations [on small business]. The regulations on companies today are so outrageous that they cannot compete.\n\nTrump also spoke of his \u201cmajor tax cut\u201d to correct the problem that \u201csmall businesses are paying taxes that are way too much.\u201d\n\nNotably, George W. Bush complained in a post-presidential interview with Bill O\u2019Reilly that small businesses, which create 70 percent of new jobs, pay taxes at an individual rate. It\u2019s a problem that Bush never corrected in the White House. As this reporter revealed, then-House Majority Leader John Boehner pushed tax reform off the Republican agenda during the year of the 2006 midterms, which the GOP ended up losing, costing the Republicans any chance to pass a tax reform bill during the Bush presidency.\n\nOn the subject of Bush, Trump doubled down on his criticisms of Bush-era national security policies.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t have weapons of mass destruction\u2026We attacked Iraq but they did not knock down the World Trade Center\u2026they de-stabilized the Middle East.\u201d\n\nTrump, trailing Cruz 28 percent to 26 percent nationally in a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll but leading widely in other national polls and in South Carolina, is clearly making an effort to get back on point after the media painted him as being in an emotional tailspin following the contentious debate in Greenville.\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s Republican rivals, including Rubio, appeared on CNN at the same time for a town hall event in Greenville. Trump will take the CNN stage Thursday night for the second part of the event.\n\nAs Ted Cruz rails against Trump\u2019s \u201cfrivolity\u201d and Jeb Bush radio ads ask if America wants \u201cour children exposed to\u201d Trump, who has said swear words in the past that are still on tape, the best thing for the front-runner to do right now is to focus on the issues. On this front, Trump made a strong case in Wednesday\u2019s town hall for why his fiscal policies are better off for the fact that he\u2019s not taking corporate donor money like his opponents.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Donald Trump Pivots to Tax and Spending Cuts as He Gets Focus Back in South Carolina", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Donald Trump Pivots to Tax and Spending Cuts as He Gets Focus Back in South Carolina", "title": "Donald Trump Pivots to Tax and Spending Cuts as He Gets Focus Back in South Carolina - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/trump1.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/17/donald-trump-pivots-to-tax-and-spending-cuts-as-he-gets-focus-back-in-south-carolina/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump Pivots to Tax and Spending Cuts as He Gets Focus Back in South Carolina", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/trump1.jpg", "title": "Donald Trump Pivots to Tax and Spending Cuts as He Gets Focus Back in South Carolina - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Donald Trump,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Donald Trump", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Donald Trump", "published_time": "2016-02-17T18:58:22-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "Some of Trump\u2019s Republican rivals, including Rubio, appeared on CNN at the same time for a town hall event in Greenville.\nOn the subject of Bush, Trump doubled down on his criticisms of Bush-era national security policies.\nTrump went to his ace in the hole in South Carolina, trade, and explained how Mexico will effectively pay for his border wall.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\u201cI\u2019m going to cut spending bigly,\u201d Trump said, explaining how he will also increase revenues in order to bring down the debt.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDonald Trump got back to key economic issues in his in-depth town hall interview Wednesday night in Charleston, South Carolina with MSNBC hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski."}
