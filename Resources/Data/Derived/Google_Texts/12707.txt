Melo Trimble scored 24 points and grabbed eight rebounds as Maryland beat Hawaii 73-60 on Sunday to advance to the round of 16 of the NCAA Tournament.

Diamond Stone added 14 points for fifth-seeded Maryland (27-8), which advanced to the round of 16 for the eighth time in the past 22 years.

Mike Thomas had 19 points and 11 rebounds for 13th-seeded Hawaii (28-6), which won a tournament game for the first time this season.

Maryland will play Kansas next Thursday in the round of 16.

After a sluggish first half in which Maryland led 28-27, the tempo picked up in the second.

Hawaii went on a 10-4 run to take a 39-36 lead. Then the bottom fell out.

Trimble's 3-pointer, the first of the game for Maryland after 15 misses, highlighted a 14-0 run that put the Terps ahead 53-41 with just over seven minutes left. Hawaii made just 1-of-13 field goal attempts during Maryland's run.

Hawaii pressed and tried to close the margin, but the teams traded baskets the rest of the way.

Maryland had a big advantage in free throws, making 28 of 31. Hawaii made 10 of 15.

Neither team shot well. Maryland connected on 46 percent of its shots, but only made 1 of 18 from 3-point range. Hawaii shot 33 percent.

Maryland missed its first six shots and didn't score a field goal until six minutes into the game, but Hawaii held only a 6-4 lead at that point. Hawaii made only five of its first 15 shots.

Hawaii built a 10-4 lead, but Diamond Stone scored four baskets as the Terps took a 14-13 lead.

The teams traded baskets as the scoring pace picked up. Maryland led 28-27 lead at halftime.

This season has been an unexpected success for Hawaii under first-year coach Eran Ganot. In December, the NCAA slapped his program with sanctions for infractions committed under former coach Gib Arnold. The penalties include a 2016-17 postseason ban, scholarship reductions and players being allowed to transfer without having to sit out a year.

Instead of crumbling, the Warriors won the Big West Conference. They set a school record for victories in a season by beating California 77-66 in the first round of the tournament, their first win after four losses in the NCAAs.

Meanwhile, Maryland hung on to beat South Dakota State 79-74 in the first round.

It's been an up-and-down season for the Terrapins, who at one point were ranked No. 2 in the nation before losing five of their final eight games before the tournament.
