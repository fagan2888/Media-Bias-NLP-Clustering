She also said that detectives found no evidence of foul play but that the Clark County Coroner\u2019s Office would investigate.\n\nRichards declined to release a police report on the incident, saying the investigation is ongoing.\n\nAccording to the hospital spokesperson Gretchen Papez, the mother of the children had suffered a miscarriage early in her pregnancy and arrived by ambulance to the hospital with the dead twins already wrapped in linens. According to reports, the babies were about four months along when the mother miscarried.\n\n\u201cAfter suffering a miscarriage at another location, the patient arrived via EMS with twin, early gestational, deceased fetuses. The fetuses had already been wrapped in linen prior to arrival at the hospital,\u201d a hospital statement said.\n\nPapez did not specify the time of birth or the gender of the babies, but did say that hospital officials are trying to determine how the mistake occurred.\n\n\u201cWe are currently reviewing the situation to determine what occurred. However, the remains are currently in the hospital\u2019s possession, and we are working with the family at this time,\u201d Papez said.\n\nFollow Thomas D.
