It was a chance for targeted investments in safer roads and transit to move both people and freight. It was also a chance for bipartisan cooperation \u2014 something all Oregonians support.\n\nInstead, misled by flawed evidence from the oil industry, a minority in Salem decided to tie the transportation plan we all want and need to repealing Oregon's well-crafted clean fuels program. Developed over the past six years and already implemented cost-effectively elsewhere, the clean fuels program represents the kind of policy Oregonians have consistently embraced: one that delivers an increase in Oregon jobs while at the same time giving us cleaner air and significantly cutting pollution \u2014 in this case cutting air pollution of greenhouse gases and cancer-causing chemicals like benzene and arsenic. That's why the Oregon Business Association endorsed the program and worked alongside environmentalists and health advocates to pass it, both this session and previously.\n\nWe are businesspeople, but we also recognize that some profitable business models endanger both other businesses and the common good and need to change or be changed. Unfortunately, oil companies make a lot of money by polluting our air. And this pollution inordinately impacts the poor and the sick \u2014 those least able to adapt to increased pollution and a changing climate. Many Oregon businesses, particularly those that depend on historical weather patterns such as farmers and the outdoor recreation industry, are increasingly being harmed by this unfettered pollution and climate change. Bloom on wine grapes in the Willamette Valley happened a full month earlier this year than normal. This trend cannot be sustained by the Oregon wine industry \u2014 one of the state's biggest business success stories.\n\nWe agree with Pope Francis, who wrote in his recent encyclical letter on climate change that we should demand \"a greater sense of responsibility for the common good from those who wield greater power.\" It's a tremendous shame that oil companies have not invested their ingenuity and profits into figuring out how to make money without polluting Oregon and the rest of the world. But they haven't. Instead, in 2014 alone they outrageously spent over $2 million on lobbying expenses in Oregon \u2014 a relatively small state where no oil company is based \u2014 to spread misinformation about the clean fuels program.\n\nIn truth, the clean fuels program requires oil companies to change their business model by tracking and reporting on their emissions and, over time, increasing their use of cleaner fuels. As we have seen in other places with a similar program, this policy ultimately gives consumers more choices, and the impact on gasoline prices is so negligible as to be completely lost in gas price fluctuations driven by larger market forces. The idea that the clean fuels program increases gasoline prices significantly is a misleading one promoted by an industry desperate to keep using our air as a dumping ground for their pollution. But even this issue of potential increased costs is addressed, for the legislation in fact has an off-ramp if the increase in the cost of fuel due to the program gets too high.\n\nThe governor got it right \u2014 a transportation package and the clean fuels program must be decoupled. Clean air should not be pitted against safe, reliable transportation. Like many businesspeople in Oregon, we support both. But we do not support one over the other, and most Oregonians don't either. We believe we can have a good economy, a good transportation system and a clean environment. Our roads should not be taken hostage by oil companies and their lobbyists.\n\n\u2022\n\nNik Blosser is CEO of Celilo Group Media and chairman of Sokol Blosser Winery.
