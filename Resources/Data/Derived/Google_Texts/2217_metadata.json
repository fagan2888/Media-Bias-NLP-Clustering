He was one of the precious few original members of the administration still standing. It had been a long seven years.\n\nDuncan is leaving the DOE in a politically awkward position; it is currently a target of abuse from both the Tea Party right and the populist left. But as Politico\u2019s Michael Grunwald recently detailed \u2014 in a profile of Duncan that now reads like a first draft of his legacy \u2014 that\u2019s been true for the Duncan-era department essentially since Day One. Consummate progressive technocrat that he is, Duncan has always been drawn to top-down solutions, regardless of whether the politics made sense. And for nearly an entire presidency, it seemed to work.\n\nLately, though, it seems that the education reform movement that Duncan has so conspicuously embraced has lost some momentum. While many of the changes spurred by \u201cRace to the Top\u201d won\u2019t go away any time soon, there\u2019s at least some evidence to suggest that, as a political force, the education reform movement, which has never had major grassroots behind it, may have peaked. And if the next president is teachers\u2019 union favorite Hillary Rodham Clinton, it\u2019s even possible that some of the measures undertaken by Duncan and supported by reformers may be reversed.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, there will be plenty of folks who won\u2019t be crying. And one of them will be Megan Erickson, the educator, journalist and author whose new book \u201cClass War: The Privatization of Childhood\u201d was released by Verso Books last month. Using her experience as a teacher for a foundation, Erickson subjects not only the education reform movement but much of modern childhood itself to a leftist analysis. Her conclusions suggest that while figures like Duncan are part of the problem, if the goal is to shield childhood from neoliberalism as much as possible, then defeating reformers isn\u2019t enough.\n\nRecently, Salon spoke with Erickson over the phone about her her book, Arne Duncan, the education reform movement and how neoliberalism is changing our very understanding of childhood\u2019s purpose. Our conversation, which can be found below, has been edited for clarity and length. (Disclosure: I am a fan of Jacobin, where Erickson serves as an editor, and have previously written two posts for the magazine\u2019s blog.)\n\nSo where did this book come from?\n\nI got my master\u2019s degree teaching at Columbia University at Teacher\u2019s College. I student-taught 9th and 10th grade at Stuyvesant High School. Then I taught at the Young Woman\u2019s Leadership School Network; and I actually had a great experience there.\n\nWhat I saw in the schools really dismayed me; just the general atmosphere of pressure and standardized testing. At the same time, I was living in Greenpoint, so I would see kids running from the YMCA all the time. They were playing, they were learning music and getting outdoor experience in the park \u2014 they were having fun. It was the way teaching should be, as opposed to the kind of punitive, \u201cmetal-detector\u201d atmosphere that I saw in a lot of schools.\n\nAll of which is a long way to say that I joined the YMCA, running a nursery school and after-school program, and one of my roles was working with parents who were applying with their kids to kindergarten.\n\nYour point of view shifted from the supply side to the demand side. So were you counseling the kind of parents who are convinced that their kid won\u2019t get into Harvard unless she gets into the right kindergarten?\n\nI was working with parents from a lot of different class backgrounds. The pressure on parents \u2014 from the top echelon of income earners all the way to the bottom \u2014 it struck me really profoundly; the weight of their decisions, and feeling like they\u2019ll have a huge impact on what your kids are able to do later in life; that was something I heard constantly repeated by parents.\n\nAlso, at the same time, I saw a lot of articles that were being written as if there\u2019s this secret thing that we\u2019re not supposed to talk about \u2014 but we\u2019re going to talk about! \u2014 and it\u2019s that \u201cwe\u201d hate parenting. And I thought: Maybe it\u2019s not parenting you hate. Maybe you don\u2019t regret becoming a mother or a father, but parenting is not fun anymore.\n\nIt can be a major source of anxiety, in fact.\n\nOne thing I found out when researching this book is that the term \u201chelicopter parent\u201d was first used in the late \u201980s. I think it\u2019s no accident that that coincides with when \u201cA Nation at Risk\u201d was published, and there was this paradigm shift to the idea of childhood as a time of preparation for adulthood.\n\nHow early does that process start, do you think? Once kids enter into school? Or before even that?\n\nThere\u2019ve been tons and tons of great books on education, but what I wanted to add to the conversation was that this really starts from early childhood. It\u2019s everywhere.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Reforming schools should not be a proxy for reforming society,\" educator and journalist Megan Erickson tells Salon", "author": "Elias Isquith", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Reforming schools should not be a proxy for reforming society,\" educator and journalist Megan Erickson tells Salon", "title": "The Arne Duncan era is over \u2014 but his noxious policies mean childhood in America is still under threat", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/03/the_arne_duncan_era_is_over_but_his_noxious_policies_mean_childhood_in_america_is_still_under_threat/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/arne_duncan2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Reforming schools should not be a proxy for reforming society,\" educator and journalist Megan Erickson tells Salon", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/arne_duncan2.jpg", "title": "The Arne Duncan era is over \u2014 but his noxious policies mean childhood in America is still under threat", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The Arne Duncan era is over \u2014 but his noxious policies mean childhood in America is still under threat", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, a nation at risk, Arne Duncan, Charter schools, Common Core, Editor's Picks, Education, Education Reform, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Inequality, Jacobin, jacobin magazine, megan erickson, Michael Bloomberg, Michael Grunwald, neoliberalism, No Child Left Behind, Standardized Testing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Lately, though, it seems that the education reform movement that Duncan has so conspicuously embraced has lost some momentum.\nRecently, Salon spoke with Erickson over the phone about her her book, Arne Duncan, the education reform movement and how neoliberalism is changing our very understanding of childhood\u2019s purpose.\nUsing her experience as a teacher for a foundation, Erickson subjects not only the education reform movement but much of modern childhood itself to a leftist analysis.\nConsummate progressive technocrat that he is, Duncan has always been drawn to top-down solutions, regardless of whether the politics made sense.\nThere\u2019ve been tons and tons of great books on education, but what I wanted to add to the conversation was that this really starts from early childhood."}
