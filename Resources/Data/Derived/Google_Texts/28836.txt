A 14-year-old Merrit Brown Middle School student is recovering from emergency brain surgery after an altercation at school Thursday morning.

Mikaily Droder's family told Newschannel 7 she was walking to class Thursday morning, when her mother says she was "attacked from behind" and slammed into the wall, then to the ground.

Her mother, Carrie Droder says she was then rushed to Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center to undergo surgery.

Mikaily's family says she is on the road to recovery, and they want to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers.

Donations to help cover medical expenses can be made at Innovations Credit Union under Mikaily or Carrie's names.

No word on the girl who is said to be responsible for the attack.
