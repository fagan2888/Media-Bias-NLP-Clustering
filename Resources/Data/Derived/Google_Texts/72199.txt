NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — The deadline has come and gone to get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act’s open enrollment period.

The last day to sign up was on Sunday.

Those who remain uninsured will be fined.

Purchasing health insurance is now the law. If you don’t, you’ll pay a penalty, and this year those who don’t enroll will have to cough up more cash than last year.

In 2015, the fine was $325 per person.

In 2016, the minimum penalty is $695 or 2.5 percent of your taxable income.

You’ll pay the fee when you file your federal income tax.

At the Matthew Walker Comprehensive Health Center, employees have been busy for the past several weeks helping Middle Tennesseans sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.

“The first thing people want to know is, can you tell me how much it will cost? We can’t tell you how much it will cost right away because every situation is different,” said Community Outreach Coordinator Julie Morris.

Depending on your situation, purchasing insurance could cost you very little.

“We’ve seen people that it helps and when they receive that tax credit, it has brought many down to less than a hundred dollars a month. I’ve even signed up somebody and it came up to $25 a month,” said Morris.

Morris says she’s met with a few people who said they’d rather pay the fine than sign up.

“We encourage them that if they can afford it, please go ahead and pick an insurance because if you get hit by a bus tomorrow guess what, you have to pay out of pocket and those are expenses that most people can’t afford,” said Morris.

Even though the deadline has passed, it doesn’t mean the federal exchange is closing.

A special enrollment period is offered to people who experience life changes through the year like getting married, having a baby or losing a job..

So far, 11.6 million people have signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act for 2016.
