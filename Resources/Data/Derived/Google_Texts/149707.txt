Karen Oberg was diagnosed nine months ago with Stage 4 lung cancer. For the last seven months, Karen had been receiving treatment at the University of Michigan. Last week, just 12 hours prior to a scheduled chemo treatment, the University of Michigan Health System told Karen that her insurance carrier, Total Health Care, had refused to continue covering treatment at their hospital.

Karen’s son, John, started a campaign on Change.org to get Total Health Care to resume coverage. “After spending hours on the phone trying to get help from Total Health Care, I wasn’t getting any assistance for how my mom can continue her coverage at the hospital we’ve been going to for months,” said John. “I hope the company starts treating my mom as the person she is rather than another dollar sign or statistic.”

Karen began treatment at a different hospital, but — after poor treatment and a misdiagnosis — switched to the University of Michigan, where she has received great care and comfort. “The warmth of the University of Michigan staff helping me through these difficult times is only outdone by my son’s support for me,” said Karen.

The Obergs have received over 36,000 signatures since the last week, making it the fastest growing petition on Change.org right now.

“After being through so much together, my mom and I want these last few months together to be as joyful as possible,” said John. “Quality health care from doctors we know and trust is all we ask for.”
