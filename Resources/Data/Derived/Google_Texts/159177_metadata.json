Paul Poirier, I-Barre, has introduced a bill that he says would resolve any issues between consumers and health providers. Poirier\u2019s bill would create a new state office, the office of health care advocate, which he said would be the equivalent to the Department of Public Service in matters related to utilities.\n\n\u201cWe have made a change in terms of who represents the public in terms of health care,\u201d Poirier said. \u201cAs we\u2019re moving toward a single payer health care system, we\u2019ve created the Green Mountain Care Board, and that board is charged with creating everything \u2014 how we\u2019re going to pay for [a] single-payer [system], what the benefit plan is going to be, and everything else.\u201d\n\nVermont is the first state to implement a government-run system of health care, which will be known as Green Mountain Care. The new system is set to take effect in Jan. 2017.\n\nWhile Gov. Peter Shumlin seems convinced the Green Mountain Care board can handle such concerns, Poirier isn\u2019t so sure.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a regulatory board and one of their primary goals is to protect the solvency of insurance companies, (but) sometimes protecting the solvency of insurance companies comes at the expense of higher rates for consumers,\u201d he added.\n\nPoirier, who has spoken with the governor on the topic, said Shumlin recognizes the need for some kind of public protection in matters of health care, but is counting on the Green Mountain Care board to do the job.\n\nVermont Watchdog reached out to Shumlin\u2019s office multiple times, but spokeswoman Sue Allen offered no response by time of publication.\n\n\u201cI and some of my colleagues believe that just because the state of Vermont becomes the insurance company for the state of Vermont doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to act any differently than an insurance company does,\u201d Poirier said.\n\nThat\u2019s why this new \u201cpowerful position,\u201d as Poirier said he envisions it, could intervene on the public\u2019s behalf because the \u201cchief health care advocate\u201d would be given \u201cautomatic party status\u201d whenever addressing the regulatory health care board.\n\nThe chief health care advocate, or the person in charge of the independent office, wouldn\u2019t be considered part of the administration. Rather, he or she would be elected to the position by the Legislature.\n\n\u201cThey could file their own motions in front of this [Green Mountain Care] regulatory board and bring their own motions forward by saying we\u2019re not spending enough money out of every dollar on providing care, the administrative costs are too high, whatever they deem is appropriate for protecting the rights of consumers and the benefits of consumers,\u201d Poirier said.\n\nIn addition, Poirier said the health care advocate would reach out through surveys and public meetings to better gauge what the public cares about.\n\nAnd as far measuring the health care advocate\u2019s success, Poirier said that conclusion would be \u201csubjective,\u201d but added its success would ultimately be determined by how effective it is in affecting the health care system, which is supposed to meet the needs of Vermonters.\n\nWhat would be the cost for all this? Poirier said the advocate would receive an $100,000 annual salary. The total annual budget for the entire office with its 25 employees would amount to about $2 million in its first year.\n\nDarcie Johnston, president and founder of Vermonters for Health Care Freedom, thinks that\u2019s too much. While Johnston said having someone to look out for the interests of Vermonters is important, Johnston suggested the need for a position such as health care advocate is indicative of what to expect under a \u201csingle-payer\u201d health care system, set to take effect in 2017.\n\n\u201cIf we have to fund a consumer advocate to protect Vermonters from government\u2019s misdeeds at that rate for just the [Vermont Health Connect] exchange right now, can you imagine what we\u2019re going to need once they\u2019re in charge of the whole thing?\u201d she said.\n\nJohnston also questioned why Shumlin hasn\u2019t proposed anything to fix the botched rollout of the exchange, alluding to damage control efforts by Massachusetts \u2014 albeit costing that state an extra $10 million.\n\n\u201cIf the exchange is in chaos and dysfunction, then people will be so frustrated they\u2019ll think that going to government-run health care and getting rid of the exchange will be better,\u201d Johnston said.\n\nContact Jon Street at jstreet@watchdog.org and find him on Twitter @JonStreet.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Gov.
