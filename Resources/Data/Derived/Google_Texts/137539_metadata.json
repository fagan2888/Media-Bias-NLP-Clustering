Indeed, as Lloyd H. Dean, president and CEO of California-based Dignity Health, put it: \"Compassion and kindness aren't expensive, but the yield is priceless.\"\n\nHospitals that feature compassionate care also share some of the following characteristics, according to the whitepaper:\n\nThey make their employees a priority. Physician burnout is on the rise and pressure to show compassion may actually increase emotional exhaustion in nurses, FierceHealthcare previously reported. To combat this, some successful caregiver support initiatives include mindfulness training programs, expressive therapy centers and weekly wellness conferences, the whitepaper states.\n\nThey involve patients and their families. Family-centered medical rounds, 24/7 visiting hours and executive decision-making teams that include patients and their families are effective strategies, the whitepaper states.\n\nThey emphasize compassion in hiring and training. While one hospital employs a talent-management agency to \"hire for attitude,\" another holds 150 workshops a year to train frontline staff on empathy.\n\nThey have a culture of experimentation and compassion. To achieve this, senior management support is essential, since a willingness to try new initiatives involves risk,\" the report states. \"Successful institutions encourage new ideas at all levels.\"\n\nThey coordinate care. One particularly successful initiative that several hospitals shared was shift-to-shift reporting at the bedside, which allows clinicians to keep each other, as well as the patients and their families, up to speed.\n\nThey embrace transparency. The use of Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys (HCAHPS) gives hospitals not only the opportunity to compete with one another to improve the patient experience, but also allows institutions to target internal improvements, according to the report.\n\nThey keep it simple. Improving compassionate care can be as simple as asking nurses to spend more time at patients' bedside or changing food service protocols, the whitepaper noted.\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- check out the whitepaper (.pdf)\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nDrive hospital bottom line with culture of kindness, compassion\n\nCompassionate care key in decreasing patient pain, boosting outcomes\n\nStudy: Nurses that show more compassion suffer fatigue, stress\n\nGiving patients what they want: Trust, compassion\n\nRespect: The key to patient safety and preventing medical errors", "article_metadata": {"description": "Healthcare organizations that show a commitment to compassion enjoy a better bottom line as well as increased patient and caregiver satisfaction, according to a\u00a0whitepaper\u00a0from the Swartz Center for Compassionate Healthcare.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Healthcare organizations that show a commitment to compassion enjoy a better bottom line as well as increased patient and caregiver satisfaction, according to a\u00a0whitepaper\u00a0from the Swartz Center for Compassionate Healthcare.", "title": "The link between compassionate care and patient satisfaction", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/link-between-compassionate-care-and-patient-satisfaction/2015-03-23", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Compassionate Care,Hospital Consumer Assessment of Health Providers and Systems (HCAHPS),HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement,Patient Satisfaction,Swartz Center for Compassionate Healthcare", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,HR & Workforce Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Patient Engagement,Patient Satisfaction"}, "article_summary": "Hospitals that feature compassionate care also share some of the following characteristics, according to the whitepaper:They make their employees a priority.\nPrevious research has indicated further benefits of compassionate care, including lowering blood pressure, reducing perception of pain in patients and even shortening the length of the common cold.\nImproving compassionate care can be as simple as asking nurses to spend more time at patients' bedside or changing food service protocols, the whitepaper noted.\nHealthcare organizations that show a commitment to compassion enjoy a better bottom line as well as increased patient and caregiver satisfaction, according to a whitepaper from the Schwartz Center for Compassionate Healthcare.\nFamily-centered medical rounds, 24/7 visiting hours and executive decision-making teams that include patients and their families are effective strategies, the whitepaper states."}
