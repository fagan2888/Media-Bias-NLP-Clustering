While Obama has no more official influence over the FCC than you or I, this would keep internet providers from being able to speed up or slow down your internet service to certain sites, or to charge more for \u201cfast lanes.\u201d Basically, the idea would be to keep the internet the way it is now, without allowing the cable companies, which are already a de facto monopoly, to control the speed of the internet to sites you want to access. While it\u2019s not quite as good as making net neutrality the law, at least it was something. Lip service, maybe, but at least it was good lip service.\n\nStill, political parties have to oppose everything the other side does, leading Texas Senator (and likely 2016 presidential candidate) Ted Cruz to tweet quite possibly the dumbest statement a politician has made about the internet since that other Senator Ted (Stevens, of Alaska) called it \u201ca series of tubes\u201d back in 2006.\n\n\"Net Neutrality\" is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government. \u2014 Senator Ted Cruz (@SenTedCruz) November 10, 2014\n\nThat\u2019s right, the idea that service providers shouldn\u2019t be able to favor their partner companies is somehow \u201cthe speed of government.\u201d Don\u2019t waste any time trying to figure out what that means, you will be much dumber for it. God help us if our internet ever operates at the stupidity of politicians. The ones and zeros would start arguing with each other over who was tougher on Ebola and your YouTube videos would buffer for the entire month of August.\n\nUPDATE: As Gizmodo points out, Ted Cruz (along with a ton of other Senators in both parties who have received money from cable companies), has received $47,000 in donations from the major cable providers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senator Ted Cruz calls Net Neutrality \"Obamacare for the Internet.\" This man is a possible presidential candidate.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Ted Cruz Just Outdid Ted Stevens For The Dumbest Thing A Politician Has Ever Said About The Internet\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/uproxx.com\\/webculture\\/ted-cruz-just-outdid-ted-stevens-for-the-dumbest-thing-a-politician-has-ever-said-about-the-internet\\/\",\"image_url\":\"https:\\/\\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\\/2014\\/11\\/tedcruz.jpg?quality=90&w=650\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"UP-721926\",\"pub_date\":\"2014-11-10T22:20:10Z\",\"author\":\"Vince Mancini\",\"section\":\"WEBCULTURE\"}", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "site": "@UPROXX", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@UPROXX"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News and Culture for the Digital Generation", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\": \"story\"}", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1109605093", "fb": {"admins": "680207693,2208604", "page_id": 116548701336, "app_id": 117400151618132}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://uproxx.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/bae760df0e3bd64e122a0b36facaee58?s=16", "application-name": "UPROXX", "google-site-verification": "370ZQZwYhpp3OFLpudIZ11ONRN8X1ZhGglPMAFJ6GKw", "keywords": "webculture, net neutrality, ted cruz, ted stevens, texas", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UPROXX", "published_time": "2014-11-10T22:20:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-11T21:29:47+00:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "UPROXX", "description": "Ted Cruz says Net Neutrality is \u201cObamacare for the internet.\u201d", "title": "Ted Cruz Just Outdid Ted Stevens For The Dumbest Thing A Politician Has Ever Said About The Internet", "url": "http://uproxx.com/webculture/ted-cruz-just-outdid-ted-stevens-for-the-dumbest-thing-a-politician-has-ever-said-about-the-internet/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/tedcruz.jpg?quality=90&w=650", "height": 472}, "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "ted cruz, net neutrality, obamacare, internet, fcc, obama"}, "article_summary": "\"Net Neutrality\" is Obamacare for the Internet; the Internet should not operate at the speed of government.\nUPDATE: As Gizmodo points out, Ted Cruz (along with a ton of other Senators in both parties who have received money from cable companies), has received $47,000 in donations from the major cable providers.\nGetty ImagePresident Obama came out in favor of net neutrality this week, saying that the FCC should reclassify the Internet as a public utility.\nWhile it\u2019s not quite as good as making net neutrality the law, at least it was something.\nStill, political parties have to oppose everything the other side does, leading Texas Senator (and likely 2016 presidential candidate) Ted Cruz to tweet quite possibly the dumbest statement a politician has made about the internet since that other Senator Ted (Stevens, of Alaska) called it \u201ca series of tubes\u201d back in 2006."}
