At least 20 protesters were arrested at Minnesota’s Mall of America Saturday night during a “Black Lives Matter” demonstration against police brutality.

The demonstration took place despite threats that it would be in violation of mall policy. Protesters shouted “black lives matter,” “hands up, don’t shoot” and “no justice, no peace,” CNN reported.

Some protesters reportedly raised their hands in the air and staged a “die-in” in solidarity with Michael Brown and Eric Garner — two unarmed black men who died at the hands of police.

During the protest, management shut down the stores on one side of the mall and projected a message on the wall that said, “This demonstration is not authorized and is in clear violation of Mall of America policy. We expect all participants to disperse at this time. Those who continue to demonstrate will be subject to arrest.”

Mall of America later said in a statement: “We are extremely disappointed that organizers of [the] Black Lives Matter protest chose to ignore our stated policy and repeated reminders that political protests and demonstrations are not allowed on Mall of America property,” CNN reported.

Some of the protesters left willingly, but at least 20 others were arrested.

Bloomington City Attorney Sandra Johnson said they will have to face the consequences.

“We will prosecute them to the full extent of the law because they knowingly broke the law because they were involved in a situation that was very potentially dangerous and refused many warnings to leave and they chose to be arrested,” she said, a local NBC affiliate reported.
