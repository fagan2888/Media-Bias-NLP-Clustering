The party needs to \u201cstraighten out the system, because the people want their vote,\u201d he added.\n\nRelated: If Trump and Cruz Flame Out, Who\u2019s Next on the Delegates\u2019 List?\n\nTrump has grown increasingly agitated in the past few weeks, after it became plain that his campaign was badly unprepared to follow up on his early success in Republican primaries with the on-the-ground work needed to assure that delegates friendly to him were actually sent to the convention to work on his behalf.\n\nThe GOP nominating process is complicated by the fact that each state sets its own rules for how the delegates are selected. Trump\u2019s main problem boils down to this: in many states, the results of the primary election or caucus determine how many delegates from the state will be sent to the convention with an obligation to vote for a specific candidate on the first and perhaps the second ballot. But they don\u2019t determine who those delegates will be, and who their preferred candidate is.\n\nThose decisions are made in myriad ways, but typically at meetings of the state parties, where organization is critical. The Ted Cruz campaign has outclassed Trump\u2019s people in that regard, placing delegates loyal to the Texas senator in seats won by Trump. Those delegates will have to support Trump in a roll call vote for one or two ballots, but will be free to switch afterward. They will also be free to vote against Trump\u2019s wishes on other matters, for instance, on decisions about the rules under which the convention will operate.\n\nTrump has characterized the system as rigged in favor of Cruz, and indeed, if he fails to get a majority of the delegates by the time the convention begins, there is a strong possibility that when ostensible Trump delegates start flipping their votes on the second and third ballots, he could lose.\n\nRelated: Here\u2019s Why Trump Is Claiming He Was Cheated in Colorado\n\nFor the second weekend in a row, Trump stayed off the talk show circuit, sending surrogates who amplified his message. On Fox News Sunday, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was asked what his boss meant by promising a \u201crough July\u201d for the GOP if Trump comes into the convention with the largest share of delegates but loses the nomination.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s saying is that he\u2019s going to be the Republican nominee, and anything they\u2019re going to try to do to stop him from being that is going to be detrimental,\u201d Lewandowski said.\n\nRelated: Bernie Sanders Goes All in with Pope Francis\n\nTrump himself has suggested that there might be riots in Cleveland, and informal Trump adviser Roger Stone has called for \u201cDays of Rage\u201d protests.\n\nLewandowski was asked if Trump was suggesting that there could be violence. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re talking about is a fractured party. What we\u2019re talking about is millions of people who have turned out to support Donald Trump, and now they\u2019re saying potentially they\u2019re going to take this away from Donald Trump at a convention.\n\nOn ABC\u2019s This Week, Trump convention manager Paul Manafort, who is in charge of salvaging the billionaire\u2019s delegate gathering operation, reinforced the claim that the system is \u201crigged,\u201d claiming that delegates are being chosen in \u201cclosed caucuses with no voters.\u201d\n\nHe said that is why the Trump campaign didn\u2019t try to win delegates in Wyoming when that state chose part of its overall slate this weekend. Describing it as a \u201cclosed system,\u201d he said, \u201cWe didn\u2019t play there because we didn\u2019t want to waste our money.\u201d\n\nRelated: Hillary and Bernie Mix It Up Over Guns, Goldman, and Gaza\n\nCruz, however, did play in Wyoming and was rewarded with 14 out of 14 delegates on Saturday.\n\nTrump has directed much of his anger at the Republican National Committee, which he claims has been actively working against him. RNC Chair Reince Priebus, however, made several appearances Sunday morning and his message was consistent: The rules have been set and public since at least October, and the RNC has no power to change them. Furthermore, the RNC itself has no authority to set the rules for the convention, which will be determined by a subcommittee made up of delegates and then ratified by the entire convention.\n\nHowever, Priebus wasn\u2019t above taking a dig at Team Trump\u2019s unfamiliarity with the process.\n\nAfter the primaries and caucuses, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s another part of the process that is, as a candidate, making sure that the people who are sitting in those [delegate] seats are people that, once the process gets going, are friendly to your wishes and desires. That\u2019s a function of each campaign doing a good job in each of these states with grassroots activists\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Donald Trump campaign this weekend continued its assault on the Republican National Committee and the party\u2019s nominating process, with the billionaire frontrunner demanding unspecified changes to the system in advance of the nominating convention, and warning of dangerous consequences for the party if his demands are not met.", "title": "Trump Threatens the GOP with a \u2018Rough July\u2019 If He\u2019s Not the Nominee", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/17/Trump-Threatens-GOP-Rough-July-If-He-s-Not-Nominee", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04132016_Donald_Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/17/Trump-Threatens-GOP-Rough-July-If-He-s-Not-Nominee", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/04132016_Donald_Trump.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Donald Trump campaign this weekend continued its assault on the Republican National Committee and the party\u2019s nominating process, with the billionaire frontrunner demanding unspecified changes to the system in advance of the nominating convention, and warning of dangerous consequences for the party if his demands are not met.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWhat he\u2019s saying is that he\u2019s going to be the Republican nominee, and anything they\u2019re going to try to do to stop him from being that is going to be detrimental,\u201d Lewandowski said.\nThe RNC \u201cbetter get going or they\u2019re going to have a rough July at that convention,\u201d Trump said angrily from the stage at a rally over the weekend.\nOn Fox News Sunday, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was asked what his boss meant by promising a \u201crough July\u201d for the GOP if Trump comes into the convention with the largest share of delegates but loses the nomination.\nWhat we\u2019re talking about is millions of people who have turned out to support Donald Trump, and now they\u2019re saying potentially they\u2019re going to take this away from Donald Trump at a convention.\nThe Ted Cruz campaign has outclassed Trump\u2019s people in that regard, placing delegates loyal to the Texas senator in seats won by Trump."}
