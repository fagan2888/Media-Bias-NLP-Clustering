Jerry Brown urged fiscal caution Thursday in his State of the State address, calling for lawmakers to beef up California\u2019s rainy day fund and pay for long-delayed infrastructure repairs instead of pursuing expensive new programs.\n\nAs he did in his budget proposal last week, Brown sought funding for health care and transportation initiatives he previously proposed rather than push for new social programs supported by many of his fellow Democrats. Republicans have opposed his funding plans for those initiatives.\n\n\u201cYou are not going to hear me talk today about any new programs. Rather I am going to focus on how we pay for the commitments we have already made,\u201d the governor said.\n\nThe 77-year-old governor also used his 14th State of the State address to outline the state\u2019s \u201cvery progressive but volatile tax structure\u201d that tracks a world economy he called profoundly uncertain.\n\n\u201cA slowdown in China or turmoil in Iraq or Syria, or virtually anywhere can send the stock market reeling and put California jobs and state revenues in jeopardy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe challenge is to solve today\u2019s problems without making those of tomorrow even worse.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic governor also decried wage stagnation he said has plagued many Americans and outlined the state\u2019s response that has included an increased minimum wage, stronger wage laws protecting unionized workers and an earned income tax credit.\n\n\u201cWe also know that inequality has risen sharply in recent decades,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the disappearance of many middle class jobs and the growing share of income taken by the top 1 percent and even more so by the top .01 percent.\u201d\n\nCalifornia has \u201cwholeheartedly embraced the Affordable Care Act,\u201d enrolling 13.5 million Californians in Medi-Cal and another 1.5 million in Covered California, he said, calling it an historic achievement that will provide health security to those who could not otherwise afford it.\n\nBut those benefits come at a price, he said, noting that total Medi-Cal costs have grown by $23 billion in four years. As a result, he urged lawmakers to build up the state\u2019s rainy day fund.\n\nRepublican lawmakers responded by suggesting the state can use rebounding revenues to fund programs.\n\n\u201cThere was much focus on balanced budgets, but no mention that economic growth is the best way to ensure them in the future,\u201d Assemblyman Tom Lackey, R-Palmdale, said in a statement.\n\nBrown is entering his sixth year as governor after previously holding the post from 1975 to 1983. He will leave office after this term, though he joked about using his campaign funds to try to change the state constitution to allow a fifth term.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrown retains immense political clout, along with at least $24 million in his campaign bank account, which he can use to support or oppose any of a slew of initiatives making their way to the ballot this year.\n\nHis priorities include fixing what he called \u201cserious deficiencies\u201d in infrastructure, including state office buildings, levees, parks, universities, prisons and state hospitals. The budget he proposed last week includes using $2 billion of an expected temporary surplus for repairing and replacing aging structures.\n\nHe once again urged lawmakers to find a permanent revenue source to maintain roads and bridges that he said now need $77 billion in repairs.\n\n\u201cSooner or later we have to bite the bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cOne way or another, the roads must be fixed.\u201d\n\nSen. Jim Nielsen of Gerber, the top Republican on the Senate budget committee, said the state can fund the fixes from existing revenues.\n\n\u201cIt does appear that there\u2019s going to be additional revenues, particularly for transportation,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cHe focused on having to raise taxes for transportation ... We\u2019re not going to go along with that part of the program.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SACRAMENTO \u2014 Gov.
