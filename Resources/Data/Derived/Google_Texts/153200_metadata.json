LeBron James, Victor Cruz, Randall Cobb, Joe Haden, Michael Irvin and Andre Reed were among those who tweeted their astonishment, many saying it was the best catch they had ever seen. \u201cThat\u2019s as fine a catch as I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning. \u201cIt\u2019s just what Newman (High School) graduates do.\u201d\n\nBackground: Born and raised in New Orleans, where he went to Isidore Newman School, the same high school as Cooper, Peyton and Eli Manning. Beckham attended LSU, and entered the NFL draft after his junior season. He was the No. 12 overall pick, but a torn hamstring forced him to miss the preseason and first four games of the regular season. He exploded on the NFL in week 9, when on Monday night he had 8 catches for 156 yards against Indianapolis. Against Dallas last week, Beckham had 10 catches for 146 yards and two touchdowns, including one snag that is generating discussion as the best catch ever.\n\nKlis\u2019 take: Ordinarily, I reject ranking anything in the present in the context of best or worst of all time unless there is overwhelming data proving it so. As NHL and former MLB union chief Donald Fehr used to say, history should never be judged by contemporaries. Maybe Don Hutson made a better catch in the 1940s. I say the \u201940s were included in all time.\n\nBut the Beckham catch was something. The David Tyree helmet catch to defeat the undefeated New England Patriots in the 2007-season Super Bowl had a higher degree of difficulty because he was hammered by New England safety Rodney Harris as he hauled it in. The more remarkable aspect of that play was how Eli Manning escaped the sack for making the heave.\n\nTyree\u2019s catch required more strength. But in terms of pure athletic feat? Beckham\u2019s was superior. It was how far he had to extend his arm while snagging it that made it.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Cowboys,Giants,Odell Beckham Jr.,Peyton Manning,spotlight", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "First-and-Orange", "description": "Odell Beckham was the talk of the league last week after his incredible, one-handed touchdown catch against the Cowboys.", "title": "Odell Beckham Jr.: Spotlight on the Giants' wide receiver", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/11/29/odell-beckham-jr-spotlight-giants-wide-receiver/31144/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/11/459482246-495x332.jpg", "type": "blog"}, "twitter": {"domain": "blogs.denverpost.com", "description": "Odell Beckham was the talk of the league last week after his incredible, one-handed touchdown catch against the Cowboys.", "title": "Odell Beckham Jr.: Spotlight on the Giants\u2019 wide receiver", "url": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/2014/11/29/odell-beckham-jr-spotlight-giants-wide-receiver/31144/", "image": "http://blogs.denverpost.com/broncos/files/2014/11/459482246-495x332.jpg", "creator": "@mikeklis", "site": "@denverpost", "app": {"name": {"ipad": "Denver Post", "iphone": "Denver Post", "googleplay": "The Denver Post"}, "id": {"ipad": "id409389010", "iphone": "id375264133", "googleplay": "com.ap.denverpost"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 105517551922}, "Copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 The Denver Post.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/denverpost"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "distribution": "global", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Odell Beckham was the talk of the league last week after his incredible, one-handed touchdown catch against the Cowboys."}, "article_summary": "But the Beckham catch was something.\nAgainst Dallas last week, Beckham had 10 catches for 146 yards and two touchdowns, including one snag that is generating discussion as the best catch ever.\nLeBron James, Victor Cruz, Randall Cobb, Joe Haden, Michael Irvin and Andre Reed were among those who tweeted their astonishment, many saying it was the best catch they had ever seen.\nWhen: 11 a.m. Sunday when the awful 3-8 Giants play at the pathetic 1-10 Jaguars.\n\u201cThat\u2019s as fine a catch as I\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning."}
