The main challenge for advocates is getting young people and minorities to buy in. But an effort is underway to encourage them.\n\nIn Dallas and Fort Worth, people like Keilah Jacques are calling Texans out to get insured before the March 31 deadline. Jacques works for the non-profit CitySquare, which is spreading the word using social media blasts and weekend events called \"Rock Enroll\" where DJs spin music and people line up for gourmet food trucks.\n\nBut it\u2019s the freebies that attracted Mike Clear of East Dallas.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know all the ins and outs,\u201d Clear said. \u201cI\u2019m working, and I\u2019m really kind of poor\u2026don\u2019t need it, but obviously I do.\u201d\n\nThe KERA Radio story.\n\nHe\u2019s one of the millions of uninsured in Texas. The Department of Health and Human Services says young adults between ages 18 and 34 are enrolling more in this fourth month since the marketplace opened, but the increase has only been about 3 percentage points.\n\n'Famous procrastinators'\n\nRev. Gerald Britt with CitySquare says it\u2019s understandable that young adults have been slower to sign up.\n\n\u201cYoung people are famous procrastinators,\u201d Britt said. \u201cI talked to my daughter last night. \u2018Dad, I\u2019m going to do it next month.\u2019 Stay on them, make sure they do it, take advantage of this.\u201d\n\nHis daughter, Adrienne, is 33. Britt says she\u2019ll do it because she knows how important it is.\n\n\u201cAt some point, no matter how young you are, or how healthy you are, you\u2019re going to get sick,\u201d hesaid. \u201cYoung people who aren\u2019t insured are going to be in bad shape. So this is actually an investment for them.\u201d\n\nInsurance an 'investment' in the future\n\nSara Smith is with Texas Public Interest Research Group. She shares her story to encourage other young adults to enroll.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 25, I just graduated law school, and really this was my first time, I had no idea what to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI was apathetic a couple of years ago.\u201d\n\nSmith says the last thing young people are thinking about is insurance.\n\n\u201cHealth insurance is an investment in your health and financial future,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re protecting that. There\u2019s assistance \u2026 [it\u2019s] not something you have to do alone.\u201d\n\nOver at the LULAC National Education Service Center in Dallas, 22-year-old Karen Estrada was trying to input personal data into a computer with the help of a health care representative known as a navigator.\n\nShe hasn\u2019t enrolled yet because she\u2019s uncertain if she can afford it without any income.\n\nSign up -- or face penalties\n\nRenato De Los Santos Jr. is the center\u2019s director. He says every Tuesday and Thursday of this month, doors will be open for the community to find out their options.\n\n\u201cWe are not an agency that\u2019s normally involved with healthcare,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we want to make our facility to those people in the community who needs it right now.\u201d\n\nWith only a few weeks left before the deadline approaches, healthcare advocates are hoping more people will sign up under the Affordable Care Act -- or they face a penalty that will increase dramatically each year.\n\nFor more coverage on health, science and technology, visit KERA's Breakthroughs blog.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health/Science", "description": "The deadline to get insured this year under the Affordable Care Act is the last day of March.
