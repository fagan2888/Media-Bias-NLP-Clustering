When celebrity chef José Andrés approached the podium to deliver the commencement speech for George Washington’s Class of 2014 on May 18th, he was well aware that many of the graduating students were disappointed. While Andrés teaches a course at GWU and owns several upscale restaurants in the D.C. area, he’s no Kerry Washington, the “Scandal” star and recent “SNL” host who spoke at last year’s commencement ceremony.

That’s why Andrés enlisted the help of some of his more recognizable friends, like Craig Ferguson, Gwyneth Paltrow, Morgan Freeman, Al Roker and Jesse Tyler Ferguson in a funny video he shared with the graduating class ahead of his speech. You see, GWU president Steven Knapp tried his best to get someone a little more high-profile, but these celebs insisted that Andrés was the best guy for the job. Hopefully, the Class of 2014 will find Andrés’s message just as inspiring as they would a speech delivered by the voice of God. Congratulation, graduates! Be thankful for today, because it’s all downhill from here.
