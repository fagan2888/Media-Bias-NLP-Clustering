CHE Trinity Health lays off 45 IT employees

Livonia-based CHE Trinity Health today announced it has laid off 45 employees in its information technology department as part of an effort to trim costs and improve efficiencies by $300 million over three years as part of its merger earlier this year with Catholic Health East.



Thirty-two of the 45 IT employees work in Michigan – 17 in Livonia, four in Novi and 11 at several of Trinity's 10 Michigan hospitals – said Carol Tingwall, Trinity's director of communications. The other laid-off employees were located at Trinity offices in other states.



The 45 employees represent 2.4 percent of Trinity's 1,912 IT workers, Tingwall said. Since August, 35 additional non-patient care employees in various departments have left as part of workforce efficiency reviews, she said.
