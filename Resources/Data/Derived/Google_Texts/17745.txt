Polling data released earlier this week by the Pew Research Center shows most Republicans strongly supporting GOP presidential candidate Donald Trumpâ€™s hard line stance on immigration.

According to the surveys conducted by Pew, more than half (53%) of Republicans and Republican-leaning voters believe that immigrants burden the country by taking jobs, housing, and health care. Just a little over one-third (36%) view immigrants as strengthening the nation via hard work and their talents.

A far larger (43%) proportion of GOP voters say they would be more likely to support a presidential candidate who wants to deport all illegal immigrations than the percentage (30%) who would be less likely to support a candidate that adopted this stance.

More than two-thirds (68%) of those polled want a fence along the entire length of the US-Mexico border. Only 27% oppose this policy.

Coming as bad news for supporters of establishment Republican presidential candidates such as Marco Rubio and John Kasich, just 38% of survey respondents like elected officials who make compromises. The vast majority prefer politicians who stick to their positions. Similarly, more than half (54%) say the American economic system unfairly favors powerful interests.
