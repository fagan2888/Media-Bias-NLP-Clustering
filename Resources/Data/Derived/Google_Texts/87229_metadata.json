Matt Cover of CNS News writes:\n\nThe IRS's assumption that the cheapest plan for a family will cost $20,000 per year is found in examples the IRS gives to help people understand how to calculate the penalty they will need to pay the government if they do not buy a mandated health plan.\n\nThe examples point to families of four and families of five, both of which the IRS expects in its assumptions to pay a minimum of $20,000 per year for a bronze plan.\n\n\u201cThe annual national average bronze plan premium for a family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children) is $20,000,\u201d the regulation says.\n\nBronze will be the lowest tier health-insurance plan available under Obamacare--after Silver, Gold, and Platinum. Under the law, the penalty for not buying health insurance is supposed to be capped at either the annual average Bronze premium, 2.5 percent of taxable income, or $2,085.00 per family in 2016.\n\nIn the new final rules published Wednesday, IRS set in law the rules for implementing the penalty Americans must pay if they fail to obey Obamacare's mandate to buy insurance.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2014/03/shocker_irs_estimates_cheapest_obamacare_plan_20k_per_family_in_2016.html", "image": "http://www.americanthinker.com/images/bucket/2014-03/191735_1_.png", "title": "Blog: Shocker: IRS estimates cheapest Obamacare plan $20k per family in 2016"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd04c9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe annual national average bronze plan premium for a family of 5 (2 adults, 3 children) is $20,000,\u201d the regulation says.\nIn an official document, the Internal Revenue Service, the enforcer of Obamacare\u2019s mandates, is estimating that the cheapest Obamacare plan (the Bronze level of coverage) will cost a family of four $20,000 per year.\nThe examples point to families of four and families of five, both of which the IRS expects in its assumptions to pay a minimum of $20,000 per year for a bronze plan.\nUnder the law, the penalty for not buying health insurance is supposed to be capped at either the annual average Bronze premium, 2.5 percent of taxable income, or $2,085.00 per family in 2016.\nBronze will be the lowest tier health-insurance plan available under Obamacare--after Silver, Gold, and Platinum."}
