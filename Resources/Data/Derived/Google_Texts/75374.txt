Friday on Bloomberg TV’s “Street Smart,” ThinkProgress.org’s Igor Volsky, Bloomberg’s Peter Cook and the Heritage Foundation chief economist Stephen Moore discussed Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) suing President Obama over his excessive use of executive action.

Moore said the Republicans lawsuit against the the president stands a good chance of success because recently the Supreme Court has struck down several of Obama’s executive power overreaches.

Moore explained, “The courts are looking very closely at executive branch power and trying to find out whether they have exceeded it.”

Moore said of the lawsuit, which specifically goes after the president alleged abuses of executive power when he delayed the implementation of the employer health insurance mandate in the Affordable Care Act, “In the case of the ObamaCare law its pretty clear the law does not give the president the right to basically suspend his own law.”
