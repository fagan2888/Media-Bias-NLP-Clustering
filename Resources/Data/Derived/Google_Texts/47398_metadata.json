Despite the attention Republican presidential candidates have given to Obamacare on the campaign trail, Republicans rate the economy and jobs, terrorism, and government spending above health care, with immigration, a hot issue on the campaign trail, coming in fifth.\n\nFemale voters (41%) are more likely than male voters (31%) to consider health care \u201cextremely important\u201d to their vote. Within all groups, more voters say health care is extremely important than say the same about immigration or income inequality.\n\nWhen those who consider health care to be extremely important to their vote are asked why, three in 10 voters (30%) mention the Affordable Care Act, with three times as many saying they oppose it (21%) as favor it (7%). A similar share (29%) mention health care costs, and about a quarter (24%) mention increasing access to insurance.\n\nWith the Supreme Court currently weighing cases involving a Texas abortion law and employers\u2019 religious objections to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s contraception requirements, the poll finds a third (34%) of the public say \u201cthere is a wide-scale effort to limit women\u2019s reproductive health choices and services,\u201d while nearly half (46%) say \u201csome groups would like to limit these choices and services, but it is not a wide-scale effort.\u201d\n\nSignificantly more women than men (40% vs. 28%) and more Democrats than independents or Republicans (51% vs. 31% and 21%) say they believe there is a wide-scale effort to limit women\u2019s reproductive health choices and services.\n\nThose who perceive a wide-scale effort are more likely to describe the effort as a \u201cbad thing\u201d (25% of the public overall) than a \u201cgood thing\u201d (7% of the public overall). Female Republican voters are evenly divided as to whether the effort is good or bad, while female Democratic and independent voters are more likely to view the effort as bad.\n\nMost Democratic voters (62%) name Hillary Clinton as the presidential candidate they trust most to represent their views on women\u2019s reproductive health choices and services, while almost a quarter (23%) name Bernie Sanders. Republican voters are more divided: A quarter (26%) name Donald Trump, a fifth (21%) name Ted Cruz, and smaller shares name Marco Rubio (10%), John Kasich (7%). Some Republicans also name Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton (9%) and Bernie Sanders (5%).\n\nAmong independent voters, the largest shares trust the Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton (22%) and Bernie Sanders (20%), on reproductive health issues. Fewer cite Donald Trump (8%), Ted Cruz (7%), John Kasich (4%) or Marco Rubio (3%).\n\nAmericans\u2019 overall view of the health care law is tilting negatively in March, with 41 percent favorable and 47 percent unfavorable. While about half the public (52%) says they have not been directly impacted by the health care law, more say they have been hurt than say they have been helped (28% vs. 18%, respectively). Democrats are more likely to report being helped, while Republican are more likely to report being hurt.\n\nWith the ACA\u2019s third open enrollment period over, the survey also assesses why those who remain uninsured did not obtain coverage, and cost remains the main barrier. Among those without health insurance, nearly half (48%) say they tried to get coverage but that it was too expensive. Others say they tried to get coverage but were unable (14%), they did not know about the requirement to obtain coverage (8%) or did not think the requirement applies to them (6%). In addition, 5 percent say they would rather pay a fine than pay for coverage.\n\nDesigned and analyzed by public opinion researchers at the Kaiser Family Foundation, the poll was conducted from March 7 to 14, 2016 among a nationally representative random digit dial telephone sample of 1,201. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish by landline (421) and cell phone (780). The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points for the full sample. For results based on subgroups, the margin of sampling error may be higher.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress.com", "application-name": "The Henry J.
