The office of Jacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry is preparing an ordinance to appoint Stephanie Burch to the Chief of Real Estate position in the Department of Public Works.

Burch, if formally approved by City Council, will be “responsible for the acquisition, appraisal, management, disposal, inventory, utilization assessment and other functions relating to real property,” including fulfillment functions, and execution of purchases of real property with money from federal community development program grants.

Among other functions, the real estate chief will oversee litigation settlements for all eminent domain cases.

Burch’s private sector experience includes the intersection of real estate and corporate law. Burch also worked for FDOT as assistant general counsel and special counsel from 2010 to 2015, in which capacity she handled procurement documentation for I-4, I-595, and SunRail projects.

Burch holds a law degree from Florida Coastal School of Law, and her undergraduate work was at Michigan State.

She is the Acting Chief of the Real Estate division already, according to her LinkedIn profile.
