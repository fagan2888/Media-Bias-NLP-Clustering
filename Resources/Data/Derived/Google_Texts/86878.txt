The crowd at Omaha's Walnut Grove Park this afternoon was decked in red, white, blue...and filled with political fervor.

Nebraska's Tea Party hosted an Independence Day Picnic and Rally today to energize its base in preparation for the upcoming 2016 election.

The event featured speeches from several prominent conservative political leaders, including Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts and U.S. Senator Ben Sasse.

The speakers touched on a variety of topics, including taxes, federal spending, and the recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings legalizing same-sex marriage and affirming Obamacare.

Senator Sasse said: "We believe you're not fully understanding the American experiment if you believe the nature of America is about powers decreed and administered from Washington."
