Avalanche center Nathan MacKinnon missed his seventh consecutive game with a knee injury Sunday, and given that he has not resumed skating and the regular season ends Saturday, he probably will finish on the injured list for the second straight year.

MacKinnon missed the last 18 games of the 2014-15 season with a broken foot. But he was deemed 100 percent recovered in late April last year and helped lead Canada to the World Championship gold medal.

He might again play for Canada this spring — along with fellow center Matt Duchene and defenseman Tyson Barrie — if his knee injury isn’t more than a sprain and won’t require offseason surgery.

The other banged-up Avs are defensemen Eric Gelinas (elbow) and Nikita Zadorov (head), plus others who have been out for most of the season.

Repeat performance. Early in last Tuesday’s game in St. Louis, Avs center Carl Soderberg flipped the puck into the stands from the defensive zone. The delay-of-game penalty led to David Backes’ power-play goal and a 1-0 lead for the Blues.

Early in Sunday’s game, it was Avs winger Gabe Landeskog who flipped the puck out of play from the D-zone. And it led to Backes’ power-play goal and a 1-0 Blues lead.

In both cases, Soderberg and Landeskog tried making indirect passes with little pressure.

Footnotes. The Avs made two lineup changes from Friday’s 4-2 loss to visiting Washington: Defenseman Zach Redmond replaced Zadorov, and Jack Skille played on the fourth line in place of Andreas Martinsen. … Among the playoff-bound Blues’ scratches were goalie Brian Elliott, defenseman Jay Bouwmeester (upper-body injury) and forwards Robby Fabbri (lower-body injury) and Ryan Reaves. … The Avs depart for Nashville, Tenn., on Monday and begin a two-game trip Tuesday against the Predators, who lost to Colorado 4-3 at home last week. Colorado visits Dallas on Thursday before Saturday’s regular-season finale against the visiting Anaheim Ducks.
