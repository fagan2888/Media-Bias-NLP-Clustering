However, Rubio did not mention that he himself had co-authored the border-opening Gang of Eight immigration bill, which President Obama endorsed.\n\nProminent conservatives \u2014 from Phyllis Schlafly to Ann Coulter to Rush Limbaugh to Rich Lowry \u2014 have all explained how the large-scale immigration policies will politically, economically, and culturally transform the nation beyond recognition.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nDuring the debate, Rubio said:\n\nLet\u2019s dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. Barack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world. That\u2019s why he passed Obamacare and the stimulus and Dodd-Frank and the deal with Iran. It is a systematic effort to change America. When I\u2019m president of the United States, we are going to re-embrace all the things that made America the greatest nation in the world.\n\nAs Gov. Chris Christie pointed out, Rubio subsequently repeated this memorized talking point \u2014 nearly word for word \u2014 two more times. Rubio later said:\n\nLet\u2019s dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. He is trying to change this country. He wants America to become more like the rest of the world. We don\u2019t want to be like the rest of the world, we want to be the United States of America.\n\nRubio later reiterated:\n\nThis notion that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing is just not true. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing \u2026 I think this notion \u2014 I think this is an important point. We have to understand what we\u2019re going through here. We are not facing a president that doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He knows what he is doing. That\u2019s why he\u2019s done the things he\u2019s done. That\u2019s why we have a president that passed Obamacare and the stimulus. All this damage that he\u2019s done to America is deliberate. This is a president that\u2019s trying to redefine this country.\n\nInterestingly, Rubio did not mention President Obama\u2019s transformational immigration agenda. Rubio championed and ushered President Obama\u2019s immigration agenda through the Senate.\n\nIndeed, reports from the Washington Post, National Review, and the Tampa Bay Times have all reported how Rubio was the salesman of the Obama-endorsed immigration plan. As Phyllis Schlafly explained in her 15-page memo documenting Rubio\u2019s record on immigration, \u201cThe White House was running the show\u201d during the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight push. As the New York Times noted at the time, the White House set up an \u201cimmigration war room\u201d in the Senate as part of a \u201cstealthy legislative operation run by President Obama\u2019s staff. Their goal is to quietly secure passage of the first immigration overhaul in a quarter century.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s 2013 Obama-backed immigration bill would have tripled green card issuances, doubled foreign worker visas, and would have given citizenship \u2014 and, thereby, welfare access and voting privileges \u2014 to the illegal population. It also would have substantially expanded fianc\u00e9 visas and refugee resettlement.\n\nRubio\u2019s 2015 immigration bill would have tripled the controversial foreign worker H-1B visa program and would have allowed for an unlimited expansion of Muslim migration.\n\nThe U.S. has admitted 59 million immigrants since 1965. One quarter of today\u2019s population is either foreign-born or a child of a foreign-born parent. Every three years, the U.S. voluntarily admits a new population of immigrants the size of Los Angeles. Over the next ten years, the U.S. will issue more green cards to foreign nationals than the population of the three early 2016 primary states \u2013 Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina \u2013 combined.\n\nYet Rubio has repeatedly pushed for these figures to be even larger.\n\nAs Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL) and Rep. Dave Brat (R-VA) recently pointed out, Rubio\u2019s immigration bill \u201cwould have tripled green card issuances over the next ten years \u2014 a population of new permanent residents almost seven times larger than the population of South Carolina.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Rubio\u2019s immigration bill would have permanently resettled more immigrants in the next decade than the population of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras combined. In recent years, 9 out of every 10 new immigrants brought into the country on green cards is from Latin America, Africa, Asia, or the Middle East.\n\nBy contrast, at the beginning of tonight\u2019s debate, GOP frontrunner Donald Trump doubled down on his pledge to temporarily pause Muslim migration. Trump explained how his position on curbing immigration distinguishes him from the other candidates: \u201cWe have a problem. Nobody else wanted to mention the problem, I brought it up.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "After Joining Obama to Transform America, Marco Rubio Warns Obama Wants to Transform America", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "After Joining Obama to Transform America, Marco Rubio Warns Obama Wants to Transform America", "title": "After Joining Obama to Transform America, Marco Rubio Warns Obama Wants to Transform America - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Rubio-Obama-AP-Photos.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/02/06/joining-obama-transform-america-marco-rubio-warns-obama-wants-transform-america/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "After Joining Obama to Transform America, Marco Rubio Warns Obama Wants to Transform America", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2016/02/Rubio-Obama-AP-Photos.jpg", "title": "After Joining Obama to Transform America, Marco Rubio Warns Obama Wants to Transform America - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Dave Brat, Donald Trump, H-1B visa program, Jeff Sessions, Muslim immigration, Phyllis Schlafly, Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government,Marco Rubio", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight", "published_time": "2016-02-06T19:53:59-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERDuring Saturday night\u2019s ABC Republican Presidential debate, donor-class favorite Marco Rubio accused Barack Obama of trying to fundamentally transform the country.\nHowever, Rubio did not mention that he himself had co-authored the border-opening Gang of Eight immigration bill, which President Obama endorsed.\nBarack Obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, to make America more like the rest of the world.\nRubio later said:Let\u2019s dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing.\nRubio later reiterated:This notion that Barack Obama doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing is just not true."}
