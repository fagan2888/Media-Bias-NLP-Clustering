PATERSON — There are six locations in Paterson where people can sign up for medical coverage under the Affordable Care Act, according to Mayor Jose “Joey” Torres.

The mayor said that under President Obama’s Affordable Care Act enrollment will be open until February 15. He said it was important to note that there would be a “short enrollment window.”

Torres said New Jersey has enrolled 161,775 people and the State’s Medicaid coverage has increased to 98,240.

“However, with all this said New Jersey still has 107,414 uninsured children,” the mayor said in a news release. “I believe it should be our priority to change this wave.”

The mayor said information on the Affordable Care Act is available at the Paterson Free Public libraries, where people can also sign up. Assistants will be available at each of the branches and they will be communicating with the public in English, Spanish, Arabic, Yoruba, Bengali, Urdu and Korean.

The locations are as follows:

The Paterson Public Library’s Southside Branch, 930 Main St.

The Main Library, the Danforth Library, 250 Broadway

Totowa Branch at 405 Union Ave.

Paterson Community Health Center at 227 Broadway and 32 Clinton St.

St. Joseph’s Hospital & Medical Center, 703 Main St.

The Hyacinth Foundation at 100 Hamilton St.

Constituents can also contact the Health Insurance Marketplace call center, which is available 24 hours a day for questions and enrollment assistance at 1-800-318-2596.
