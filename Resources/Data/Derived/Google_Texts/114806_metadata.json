The studies were done between 1991 and 2015.\n\nThe Task Force found strong evidence that these programs are effective at reducing the number of new cases of diabetes, according to a report in Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\n\u201cIf you exercise and eat better, you\u2019ll reduce your risk of developing diabetes,\u201d said Dr. Patrick L. Remington, coauthor of the recommendation statement on behalf of the Task Force. \u201cBut if you simply tell somebody to eat better and exercise, that does not work.\u201d\n\nThe diet and exercise promotion programs included providers or trained laypeople working directly with participants for at least three months, providing counseling, coaching and support over multiple sessions.\n\nSome also included specialists like nutritionists, physiotherapists, individually tailored diet and exercise programs and specific weight-loss goals.\n\nThe programs were targeted to teens and adults with \u201cpre-diabetes,\u201d marked by elevated blood sugar levels that were not yet high enough to be diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\u201cIn general, people who may be at increased risk for diabetes (both adults and children) include those who are overweight or obese and those who have a sedentary lifestyle,\u201d Dr. Ethan Balk of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, lead author of the evidence review, told Reuters Health by email.\n\nThe review found that community-based programs helped improve weight loss, lower blood sugar and reduce the risk for a later diabetes diagnosis. Some also reduced blood sugar and improved cholesterol markers, and none reported any long-term harms related to the programs.\n\nIn an economic assessment, the Task Force also found that these programs are cost-effective. Half of participants paid less than $653 to take part, and costs were lower for group-based or primary-care based programs.\n\n\u201cThis is more cost effective than most of what we do in medicine, but not cost saving, it does cost something,\u201d Remington said by phone. \u201cBut the return for those costs are many years of healthy life gained, so we consider it cost effective.\u201d\n\nGyms and health clubs already offer these types of programs for a modest fee, he said.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201cshocking,\u201d he added, \u201cthat we are not doing it as a routine part of the health care system. We\u2019ve designed a healthcare system to treat sick people, not to prevent disease.\u201d\n\nThe first step may be a change in providers\u2019 attitudes, he said, noting that many doctors do not believe that diabetes can be prevented through lifestyle changes.\n\n\u201cI think that the medical community has been so influenced by long term secular trends that they\u2019ve lost confidence in the individual to treat themselves through lifestyle changes,\u201d he said.\n\nThen the insurance and outreach system needs to change, and training laypeople or nonphysician specialists to provide these programs should increase, he said.\n\n\u201cThe (Affordable Care Act) doesn\u2019t really cover these type of intense prevention programs,\u201d Remington said. \u201cGenerally we\u2019ve left people alone with advice.\u201d\n\nThere are National Diabetes Prevention Program resources in every state, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a registry of recognized programs and a \u201cFind a program near you\u201d function (link here: 1.usa.gov/1vj7p00), Balk said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1M6ih8z, bit.ly/1HrtBWf and bit.ly/1gxcvQh Annals of Internal Medicine, July 13, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"DCSext.ContentID_healthNews": "USKCN0PN2K720150713", "sailthru.author": "Kathryn Doyle", "Author": "Kathryn Doyle", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "(Reuters Health) - Organized diet and exercise programs can stave off diabetes for those at risk, according to a new recommendation.
