A few weeks ago, conservative radio host David Webb confronted an NAACP official who called Senator Tim Scott a ventriloquist’s “dummy,” and this time, on behalf of Sean Hannity‘s show, Webb went to confront an Alabama state legislator who called Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas an “Uncle Tom.”

Holmes told Webb he stands by his remarks, saying “A black man allows himself to be used to carry the message of a white man, which is against the interests of black people in America.” He continued, “In my opinion, Clarence Thomas is a very prolific Uncle Tom.”

When Webb pressed him on Tim Scott, Holmes insisted, “He goes by what the white people there tell him.” Webb told Hannity this was about “exposing ignorance, hypocrisy, bigoted behavior.”

Both of them were fired up that the remarks about Scott were basically dismissed by the current interim head of the NAACP, while Richard Fowler told them Holmes is a “red herring” used to make a point and the head of the NAACP is more focused on serious issues.
