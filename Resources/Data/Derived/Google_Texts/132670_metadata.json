(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\u201cInto the Woods,\u201d the new Disney film that opened Thursday, is not for kids or even some young teenagers. If Walt Disney were alive today, his company would not be producing this movie.\n\nI saw \u201cInto the Woods\u201d years ago in New York when it was a musical on Broadway. It\u2019s very clever and, at times, funny and there are some beautiful songs but, ultimately, it\u2019s dark and cynical.\n\nIts creator, Stephen Sondheim, is a musical genius, a lyricist and composer. But Sondheim\u2019s sad childhood has colored his view of life and relationships. His mother was psychologically abusive, his parents divorced and he, though given all the comforts money could buy, was emotionally neglected and often left without the support and comfort of a real family.\n\nThe first part tells the traditional fairy takes of Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Rapunzel, but the second half is Sondheim\u2019s take on what happens after \u201cand they lived happily ever after\u201d \u2014 and it\u2019s not happy. For the movie, there have been some changes, but characters die and scary things happen to them all.\n\nI\u2019ve been a family therapist for 30 years. Children have enough to deal with \u2014 school shootings, terrorists, broken families and a growing focus in the media and in video games on presenting evil as a non-stop, all-encompassing force. It\u2019s not hard to guess why suicide is on the rise in teenagers.\n\nWe need stories with happy endings. Even though there\u2019s pain in life, there\u2019s also beauty, joy and love.\n\nSee this movie first before you decide to take a young person to it.\n\nKristina Davis,\n\nAppleton\n\nRead or Share this story: http://post.cr/1BexOdl", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "There are too many disturbing themes for a Disney movie.", "og": {"site_name": "Post-Crescent Media", "description": "There are too many disturbing themes for a Disney movie.", "title": "Letters: \u2018Into the Woods\u2019 may be too dark for kids", "url": "http://www.postcrescent.com/story/opinion/readers/2014/12/27/letters-woods-may-dark-kids/20864299/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/postcrescent.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "There are too many disturbing themes for a Disney movie.", "creator": "@postcrescent", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a4cf34f2c3760ad53dd8ca92d2e3298e5372b34b/c=460-0-3532-3072&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/Appleton/2014/12/24/B9315630829Z.1_20141224131244_000_GRA9GPFMG.1-0.jpg", "title": "Letters: \u2018Into the Woods\u2019 may be too dark for kids", "site": "@postcrescent", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=880652726", "fb": {"app_id": 117306038338949}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd96d\"", "article_summary": "(Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\u201cInto the Woods,\u201d the new Disney film that opened Thursday, is not for kids or even some young teenagers.\n\u201cInto the Woods\u201d may be too scary for kids.\nEven though there\u2019s pain in life, there\u2019s also beauty, joy and love.\nI saw \u201cInto the Woods\u201d years ago in New York when it was a musical on Broadway.\nIt\u2019s very clever and, at times, funny and there are some beautiful songs but, ultimately, it\u2019s dark and cynical."}
