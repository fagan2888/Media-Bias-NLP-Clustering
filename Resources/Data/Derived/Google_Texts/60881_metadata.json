Three terms took a more traditional, lecture-based approach, and three demanded more participation by students. The classes averaged almost 400 students, and were taught by Dr. Hogan. The more active approach gave students more in-class activities, often done in teams, including sets of online exercises. There were similar online exercises assigned to be completed before class along with textbook reading, intended to force students to think about the material rather than just memorize it, and still others for review after a lesson. Many of the exercises were ungraded, but the instructor could tell whether students had done them. The active strategy, Dr. Hogan said, left less time for lecturing and made much of the traditional lecture moot, anyway. It helped students get more out of the reading \u2014 and, crucially, made it much harder for them to skip the reading. \u201cIn a traditional lecture course, they\u2019re not held accountable for being prepared for class, and they really don\u2019t need to be, because an instructor is going to tell them everything he or she wants them to know,\u201d Dr. Hogan said. \u201cWould you read a report for a meeting if you knew your boss was going to spend 15 minutes summarizing it for you? I know I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTo read the entire news article, click here.
