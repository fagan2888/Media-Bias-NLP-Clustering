As the economy slowly rebounds, though, financial incentives are returning, in one form or another\n\nPhysical therapist Jessica Chiovaro faced an unexpected pair of potentially sticky \u2014 and expensive \u2014 circumstances last summer when the air conditioning in her home and car conked out the same week.\n\nDespite the triple-digit desert heat and double whammy of impending repair costs, Chiovaro didn\u2019t sweat it, thanks in part to her employer, Matt Smith, who offers a quarterly bonus program for his 150 employees at Matt Smith Physical Therapy.\n\nBased on eight benchmarks that determine how each of Smith\u2019s 13 clinics is performing, the bonus program was founded three years ago in the wake of the recession as a financial incentive to boost company profitability, Smith said. Every employee, from support staff to clinicians, is eligible, including Chiovaro, who joined the practice six years ago and is clinic manager and director of clinical compliance for the Nellis Boulevard location.\n\n\u201cLuckily, my office had received a bonus the week before, so the situation wasn\u2019t nearly as stressful as it could have been,\u201d Chiovaro said. \u201cThe bonus program really shows how much Matt supports his employees and incentivizes them by creating an atmosphere of teamwork and motivation and by making financial rewards tangible.\u201d\n\nAnd the bonuses can be serious folding money, not just pocket change. Employees can earn 10 percent to more than 50 percent of their quarterly salary in a single bonus.\n\n\u201cBecause raises are discretionary at this time, the bonus program was implemented to give every employee a much larger opportunity and a piece of the pie,\u201d Smith said.\n\nSmith is among a growing number of employers who are finding alternatives to traditional raises to attract and retain employees.\n\nFrank Gatski, CEO of the 53-person Gatski Commercial Real Estate Services, said his company was hit hard by the recession. But he has found ways to do more with less, such as hosting an annual \u201cFranksgiving\u201d event and holding an employee raffle for a weekend staycation at Mandalay Bay.\n\nEven so, unlike some employers, Gatski has continued to give annual cost-of-living raises. He also offers bonuses for employees who demonstrate extra effort on special projects, promotes from within and takes a generous approach to vacation time and holidays.\n\n\u201cWe have all bankers\u2019 holidays off, and we\u2019ll use any excuse for a potluck and an early out,\u201d said Gatski, who in 2012 also created a profit-sharing plan. \u201cEvery quarter, I take 5 percent of profits and give it back to employees who have been here at least a year, based on seniority. It\u2019s just a little something extra for my team, which as a business owner, is my No. 1 commodity.\u201d\n\nBut Gatski\u2019s policies may be the exception rather than the rule, as many companies have frozen wages, suspended benefits and reduced workforces since 2008.\n\nStill, as the pendulum swings \u2014 albeit slowly \u2014 toward recovery, there may be some encouraging news on the horizon for employees.\n\nIn September, a survey of 910 U.S. companies by global professional services firm Towers Watson found that most employers were planning to give workers modest raises this year. And in USA Today\u2019s quarterly economic survey of the nation\u2019s 40 top economists, the majority predicted conservative wage gains.\n\nAmong those polled, Robert Mellman, of JPMorgan Chase, forecast pay increases of about 2.2 percent this year, and Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West, anticipated increases close to 3 percent. Anderson said pay bumps could help sustain recovery.\n\n\u201cThis is kind of the final piece of the puzzle for the consumer,\u201d Anderson said.\n\nThe Las Vegas Valley\u2019s economic climate also is improving, said Brian Gordon, a principal with local research firm Applied Analysis.\n\nGordon said increased stability in the average number of hours employees are working is a sign that the economy is on the mend, even as business owners and managers continue to develop creative incentives other than pay hikes.\n\nRyan Kennelly, an economic analyst at UNLV\u2019s Center for Business and Economic Research, said perks such as flex-time, generous vacation packages and cool company events may be the result of business owners seeing the success of other employee-friendly companies, such as Google, Amazon and Zappos.\n\n\u201cThere are many studies that show that happier employees are more productive, not that that should surprise anyone,\u201d Kennelly said. \u201cSome increased health care benefits are being forced upon employers via the Affordable Care Act, (and giving bonuses) allows businesses to pay their employees more without the commitment of a full-on wage increase.\u201d\n\nJeff Grace, president and CEO of IT company NetEffect, reinstated a 3 percent matching 401(k) plan in April as market conditions improved.\n\n\u201cWith the market volatility and uncertainty of the recession, I have only recently felt comfortable enough with the company finances to do so, but it has been high on my list for selfish reasons, because I\u2019m worried about my own retirement,\u201d said Grace, who has been unable to offer his 16 employees raises but uses a bonus program to help keep employees motivated. \u201cNobody likes to go for years without a pay raise, so we have a quarterly bonus program based on company profitability. It could be anywhere from a couple hundred dollars to a couple of thousand, depending on the quarter and the responsibility of the individual.\u201d\n\nRick Harris, founding partner of the Richard Harris Law Firm, offers a combination of financial incentives and perks to his 70 employees. Harris gives cost-of-living and merit raises, and employees are eligible for bonuses of four to eight weeks\u2019 pay if the firm meets its year-end financial goals.\n\nEmployees get 15 days of annual sick and personal time and 11 paid holidays. Staff meetings sometimes are conducted over happy hour, and Harris offers telecommuting opportunities as well as flex-time from Memorial Day to Labor Day so employees can take Friday afternoons off.\n\nLast year, Harris introduced the Your Connections programs, a free membership program for employees that offers discounts for such items as \u201cpizza to movies to Disney World,\u201d Harris said.\n\n\u201cMy employees are hardworking and smart, and they deserve an ongoing thank-you,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pay well, but for most people, it\u2019s not just about the money. They want stability and appreciation. I\u2019ve learned that if I don\u2019t thank my employees frequently, they\u2019ll find another boss who will, so I do what I need to do to keep them happy and on my team.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "The Sunday", "og": {"site_name": "VegasInc.com", "description": "As the economy slowly recovers, employers are finding ways to show their staff some appreciation.
