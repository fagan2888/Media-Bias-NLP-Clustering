Bernie Sanders (I-VT) that he might challenge former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential campaign, a new report indicates surprisingly widespread dissatisfaction with Clinton among progressive or more liberal Democrats.\n\nSanders, a socialist and leading liberal said last weekend he\u2019s thinking about running for president in 2016 as a Democrat or an Independent in a move that could greatly complicate or even threaten a second Clinton bid for the White House.\n\nRelated: Bernie Sanders Could Undercut Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 Run\n\n\u201cThe issue is not Hillary. I\u2019ve known Hillary Clinton for many years,\u201d Sanders said on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cI have a lot of respect for Hillary Clinton. The question is: At a time when so many people have seen a decline in their standard of living, when the wealthiest people and largest corporations are doing phenomenally well, the American people want change.\u201d\n\nNearly 1,500 activists, strategists, and journalists who work for The Nation and the Huffington Post participated in a progressive members-only Google forum called the \u201cGamechanger Salon\u201d over the past year, according to The Hill. There was \u201csignificant dissatisfaction\u201d with Clinton, a former New York senator and the presumed Democratic presidential frontrunner.\n\nThe newspaper said it reviewed hundreds of emails from prominent Democrats, Sierra Club officials, union officials, operatives for the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, journalists from the two left-leaning publications, and the president of NARAL. Many complained that Clinton is \u201ctoo much of a hawk, too cozy with Wall Street, hasn\u2019t spoken out enough on climate change, and will be subject to personal questions and criticisms,\u201d according to The Hill.\n\nThe emails span June 2013 and July of this year \u2013 a time when Clinton began to position herself for a possible second bid for president and pollsters and the media dubbed her the prohibitive favorite for the Democratic nomination.\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton\u2019s Steady March to a 2016 Nomination\n\nNeil Sroka, spokesman for Democracy for America and a member of the private online forum, told The Fiscal Times Thursday there is a \u201cgrowing concern\u201d among progressives about where Clinton stands on issues related to income inequality in the country.\n\n\u201cFrankly there are concerns she\u2019s had no problem delivering speeches to Wall Street firms since she left the State Department, but didn\u2019t decide to join progressives when they met in Detroit for the Netroots Nation conference this summer,\u201d he said, referring to the progressive group founded in 2006. \u201dThat is really concerning, when you\u2019re meeting with one group of folks and not meeting with the grassroots base of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nA problem for Clinton in terms of the far left is her Senate vote in support of the Iraq War in 2002. That hurt her during her battle with President Obama during the 2008 Democratic primary campaign and she recently conceded her vote was a mistake.\n\nCharles Lenchner, a progressive operative and executive director of Organizing 2.0, told The Hill that anyone else who voted for the Iraq War is \u201ctainted.\u201d He added, \u201cPersonally, I would like to see a Democratic Party where folks who enabled George Bush to drag the country into a permanent war are punished at the ballot box.\u201d\n\nRelated: Just How Rich Is Hillary Clinton?\n\nMany progressives hope Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) will change her mind and jump into the presidential race. The consumer advocate and former Harvard Law School professor has said repeatedly she has no interest in challenging Clinton. That leaves Sanders now as arguably the strongest voice for Democrats on the far left.\n\nSroka described Sanders\u2019s possible entrance into the presidential campaign as \u201creally interesting.\u201d But regardless of whether he, Sen. Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York, Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland or others jump in, Sroka said \u201cthe question of whether candidates are going to stand with the emergent and increasingly powerful Warren wing of the party is the essential one.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "On the heels of the announcement by Sen.
