My school taxes are $4,200. That\u2019s why I can\u2019t afford the medication I need. I can\u2019t afford cable TV. I can\u2019t afford the Internet. I can\u2019t even afford to go to McDonald\u2019s. Please you voters, contact your congressmen and tell them to rearrange the taxes for schools, please.\n\nI was reading the article in Tuesday\u2019s Mercury about the Keim Street bridge. It won\u2019t be ready till 2019. First of all to all the commissioners, I would never vote you in again. I would fire all of you until I get something done the proper way. Phoenixville\u2019s Mont Claire bridge happened quickly, they were very fast and efficient about it. I can\u2019t believe you are waiting until 2019 to get this bridge done. I would be embarrassed.\n\nThis is in response to the caller about the comments on the schools. Their closing was \u201cPerhaps we should get back to the basics.\u201d How perfectly said. You got my vote.\n\nThis is about Obama\u2019s awesome Obamacare. You can\u2019t even get a test done let alone go for surgery unless the hospital is calling you and telling you they want anywhere from $200 to a couple thousand dollars up front before you even have anything done. What do they think we people are made of with the economy as bad as it is but they\u2019ll fly foreigners over here at our expense and give them the best of everything. That\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not right. When is this going to stop?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary\n\nI see the street sweeper is coming out again. They seem to bring it out at the wrong time every year. I believe last year they swept the streets before the leaves all came down and this year they\u2019re sweeping them before the trees fully leaf out and before they drop all their little stringy pollen pods all over the place. They should have probably waited another couple of weeks.\n\nI\u2019d like to put Target and any other business with a ridiculous bathroom policy on notice as follows. If any of my female loved ones are using the ladies room and a male goes in you can bet I\u2019m going in and dragging him out of there and I would hope any real man would do likewise.\n\nI want you to remember that this time of the year people are spreading weed and feed, insect killers, all over the yard. Yes your grass is beautiful but those chemicals that you put on the soil leach into the water supply. You drink that water and remember if it kills insects and weeds, it\u2019s going to kill you eventually, probably with some type of cancer.\n\nStarlight\n\nThis is to the person who thinks that Donald Trump is the man to vote for because he\u2019s such a multi-billionaire and he knows business. How come his casinos are no longer viable but bankrupt? That\u2019s just what he\u2019s going to do to this country, bankrupt it. You want him so good luck to you.\n\nWhat can I say about living in New Hanover Township? Everyday I see the slum next door and even though I\u2019ve begged for code enforcement for years, nothing has ever happened. The township officials and their family members who were given jobs are too busy giving themselves huge pay raises.\n\nDisgusted Taxpayer\n\nSen. John McCain says he won\u2019t be going to the Republican Convention. I don\u2019t blame him. A war veteran is told that he\u2019s a loser. So I don\u2019t blame him for not going to the convention. That shows you what he thinks about Donald Trump, a loser.\n\nSo I see that Ted Cruz has suspended his campaign and has ceded the Republican nomination to the vulgar Donald Trump. I\u2019d like to be the first to offer my congratulations to President Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cNational Teachers Appreciation Day where America honors teachers in every way possible except a decent salary.\u201d \u2014 Conan O\u2019Brien.\n\nJohn From Mont Clare\n\nHallelujah, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders take all the votes. I\u2019m so excited. Goodbye Hillary. I hope that she\u2019s out of it and the run is between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders and may the best man win.\n\nThe longest-serving Republican House Speaker is an admitted pedophile. The Republican front-runner has been endorsed by the imperial wizard of the KKK. Republicans are banning certain Americans from public bathrooms while encouraging guns to be brought into them but hey let\u2019s all talk about how evil Hillary Clinton is.\n\nLarry From Rofo\n\nI\u2019m calling in reference to the Jim Vlahos\u2019 resignation as township commissioner in Lower Pottsgrove. My question is to the voters of the township, when will they wake up and take a hard look at the chairman and vice chairman of the township commission? The puppet strings are gone. They\u2019ve been exposed.\n\nSound Off is a forum to spur dialogue from residents of the communities we serve on topics of interest in those communities.
