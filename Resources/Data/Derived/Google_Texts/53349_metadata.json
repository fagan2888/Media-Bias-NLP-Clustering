As star Blair Underwood himself attests, they really didn\u2019t keep much outside of the name and the central conceit of a disabled lawman operating his own team. Oh, and Underwood\u2019s Robert Ironside tipples a bit of bourbon at the end of a long day, an homage to Burr.\n\nThis \u201cIronside\u201d is as different from that one as 2013 is from 1967, when the original began. This Ironside has much more in common with technical advisor David Bryant, who became a paraplegic after a ski accident he suffered at age 19. Bryant serves as a model of self-sufficiency for Underwood. The handles have been removed from his wheelchair, and Ironside\u2019s wheelchair. This Ironside is gritty and, be prepared, he has wheelchair sex.\n\nAccording to Underwood, with his character\u2019s level of functionality, post-spinal cord injury, \u201cthose nerve endings still work.\u201d And the \u201cIronside\u201d team obviously feels compelled to show us, considering their star is the guy who had viewers\u2019 pulses racing as a dream man on \u201cSex and the City\u201d and \u201cThe New Adventures of Old Christine.\u201d\n\nUnderwood has worked hard to master his wheelchair technique. He\u2019s endured tumbling over. He\u2019s learning how to pop wheelies. After being shot \u2014 as we see in the pilot\u2019s flashbacks \u2014 Ironside, he pointed out, had to learn \u201chow to drive, how to get in and out of his car, which is a big deal, how to get in and out of bed, how to work out. He had to learn his center of balance. He\u2019s paralyzed from the armpits down, so he\u2019s a little different from [the previous] Ironside, who was from paralyzed from the waist down.\u201d\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t Ironside use an electric wheelchair? \u201cHe wants to do everything he can on his own. That\u2019s an added device,\u201d noted the handsome star, whose resume also includes \u201cL.A. Law\u201d and \u201cIn Treatment.\u201d \u201cMy mother is in a wheelchair, and my father, for years, would not get an electric wheelchair because he wanted to push her. There\u2019s something about that sense of responsibility that says, \u2018I can do this.\u2019 Or in his case, \u2018I can do this for my wife.\u2019 In Ironside\u2019s case, it\u2019s \u2018I can do this for myself.'\u201d\n\nUnderwood\u2019s mother, Marilyn, has multiple sclerosis \u2014 which makes his portrayal of physical challenges especially meaningful.\n\nHe calls the show, which debuts Oct. 2, \u201ca crime drama wrapped in a character study.\u201d Some critics have called it things not nearly so nice. But flawed thought it may be, \u201cIronside\u201d has potential \u2014 especially with the charisma and acting chops of Underwood \u2014 if you can put Ray Burr\u2019s gruff but genteel chief out of your mind.\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Warning:\u00a0 Do not tune into NBC\u2019s new \u201cIronside\u201d with any expectation of a show resembling Raymond Burr\u2019s series of 40 years ago.\u00a0 As star Blair Underwood himself attests, they really didn\u2019t keep much outside of the name and the central conceit of a disabled lawman operating his own team.\u00a0 Oh, and Underwood\u2019s Robert Ironside tipples a bit of bourbon at the end of a long day, an homage to Burr.
