It\u2019s that\u2013when it comes to your current health\u2013we know more than you do.\n\nFor most patients, it\u2019s simply not true.\n\nI\u2019m not saying we have nothing to offer; I am saying how you feel says a lot. That\u2019s why good doctors take the time to explore how patients feel. For those who feel bad, we\u2019ll explore what makes you feel worse\u2013and what makes you feel better. Not infrequently, the information gleaned from this exploration\u2013we call it the history\u2013point to both a diagnosis and a strategy for managing the problem.\n\nAnd for those who feel healthy, it\u2019s just possible you might be right.\n\nThe idea that only your doctor can tell whether you are healthy or not is an unfortunate side-effect of our current emphasis on preventive medicine. Not the health promotion part of prevention\u2013that\u2019s the stuff your grandmother might have told you when you were young: Get plenty of sleep, eat your fruits and vegetables, go play outside and don\u2019t start smoking. Instead it\u2019s a side-effect of the medicalized part of prevention: when doctors embark on a high-tech search for early disease and \u201csilent\u201d abnormalities.\n\nIt\u2019s a paradigm that has created a new operational definition of health: the absence of detectable abnormality. It is a test few can pass\u2013and one that gets tougher every day as our diagnostic technologies are increasingly able to detect minute perturbations in our anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and genome.\n\nYou can even test yourself. While direct-to-consumer genetic testing may be falling out of favor, there is a developing mobile-health industry\u2013or m-health\u2013producing devices and apps to give people dashboards, gauges and alarm signals.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound healthy.\n\nDon\u2019t let doctors\u2019 machines and tests define health\u2013it\u2019s a recipe to make you sick. How you feel matters.\n\nDr. H. Gilbert Welch is a general internist at the White River Junction VA and a professor of medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in the Geisel School of Medicine.\n\nRead the latest Health Report.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "What\u2019s the biggest misconception about us doctors?
