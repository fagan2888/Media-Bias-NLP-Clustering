Modeled on the civil rights movement, it has united a diverse group of citizens in opposition to the draconian legislative agenda that\u2019s turned what was once the most moderate state in the South into a laboratory for conservative ideology. Moyers & Company documented the story in a special, \u201c North Carolina: State of Conflict ,\u201d that aired earlier this year.\n\nThe movement has since spread to Georgia, and spawned a series of \u201cTruthful Tuesdays\u201d protests in South Carolina. Rev. Dr. William Barber II, head of the North Carolina chapter of the NAACP, is one of the movement\u2019s key organizers and most prominent spokesperson. This Q&A was excerpted from a longer interview with Barber that first appeared at\n\nAs William Barber prepared to spread a message of hope and democracy through a week of actions Aug. 22-28 in Raleigh and other Southern state capitals, he talked with me about North Carolina\u2019s free-market ideology and how it has already affected the people who live there. Barber, referring to the billionaire-backed tea party, the national group that pushes free-market policies at the local and state level, says these past two legislative sessions have been a \u201ccoordinated, premeditated attempt to undermine progress and engage in regressive tea party policies.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is really Robin Hood in reverse,\u201d Barber told me. \u201cIt is government of business, bought by business, for business.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is really Robin Hood in reverse,\u201d Barber told me. \u201cIt is government of business, bought by business, for business. And not just business \u2014 because lots of business leaders disagree with them \u2014 but this is tea party greed. This is Koch brother-type greed.\u201d\n\nBarber bristles, though, at the notion that conservatism or partisan politics are at the root of the problem. \u201cI fuss against these terms \u2018liberal\u2019 versus \u2018conservative\u2019,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I want to conserve the essence of our Constitution and then liberally make sure everybody has access to them. What we\u2019re dealing with is extremism, and you can\u2019t just define it as \u2018conservative.\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the local level, says Barber, the state legislature\u2019s extreme adherence to free-market neoliberal policy is gutting the state\u2019s public school system. \u201cFive thousand teachers being fired, being removed, and local school boards decrying [this] because of the impact that it was having on classroom sizes and students,\u201d he says.\n\nBarber adds that, because of the salary cuts, he sees teachers actively leaving North Carolina. \u201cIn fact,\u201d he said, \u201cone state, Texas, sent memos out and said if you\u2019re in North Carolina, come to Texas. And you know that\u2019s kind of sad, considering Texas\u2019s regressiveness, when they actually can offer teachers more than North Carolina.\u201d\n\nBarber also described the legislature\u2019s attempt to shift $10 million earmarked for public schools to voucher programs that could only be used to pay for private schools. In shifting these public funds into private hands, said Barber, the legislature refused to require that private schools benefiting from the vouchers maintain the same non-discrimination standards that public schools must uphold, meaning that private schools receiving voucher funds would have been allowed to restrict enrollment however they chose. A Superior Court judge declared on Aug. 21 that the state\u2019s school voucher program is unconstitutional, citing the lack of accountability inherent in the program, and issued a permanent injunction stopping the voucher program from going forward.\n\n[Conservative mega-donor] Art Pope and the tea party aren\u2019t just alienating teachers and progressives, says Barber. They are also alienating Republicans across the state. Barber says that the legislature and McCrory never made clear, even to their own constituents, what they were planning to do once they achieved a supermajority in the statehouse and won the governorship. \u201cThey did not run saying, \u2018Elect me, I\u2019m going to take your health care, cut your public education, and strip you of your unemployment even if you lost your job at no fault of your own,\u2019\u201d says Barber. \u201cSo, we\u2019ve had a Republican unemployed person stand on the stage [at a Moral March] and say, \u2018I\u2019m a Republican, but I\u2019m unemployed \u2014 I didn\u2019t vote for this.\u2019\u201d\n\nEven Republicans holding public office are objecting to the legislature\u2019s actions. Adam O\u2019Neal, a self-described conservative Republican mayor from Belhaven, NC, began a one-man march of 273 miles to Washington DC on July 14 to dramatize the impact of Gov. McCrory\u2019s and [House Speaker Thom] Tillis\u2019 refusal to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. O\u2019Neal explained that the lack of Medicaid funds had forced the only hospital in his coastal community to close, creating a \u201cmedical desert\u201d that would certainly cost lives. O\u2019Neal also lamented the potential economic impact of the hospital closing; he told NPR, \u201cHow many people go retire somewhere where it doesn\u2019t even have a hospital?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey believe that the way to a great North Carolina is to deny necessary funds and access to public education. Attack teachers.\u201d\n\nI asked Barber what he believes is the neoliberals\u2019 vision for North Carolina. \u201cThey believe that the way to a great North Carolina is to deny necessary funds and access to public education. Attack teachers. Deny unemployment. Deny earned income tax credit and other safeguards for the working poor. Deny affordable healthcare and access to healthcare, even if it allows people to die. Deny labor rights, LGBT rights, women\u2019s rights, immigrant rights\u2026 And then, if you really want a great America after you\u2019ve done all these things, then suppress the right to vote and attempt to use your power to stay in office. And then, after you\u2019ve done all of that to create all this tension, ensure that everyone has access to guns easier than they have access to the polls. Now, that sounds crude and sinister, but those are their policies.\u201d\n\nHaving set this grim scene, Barber continued with a surprisingly upbeat message: \u201cWhatever we\u2019re facing now, it\u2019s not greater than slavery, it\u2019s not greater than Jim Crow, it\u2019s not greater than women being denied the right to vote. We won those battles. But we did not win those battles by merely engaging in political arguments. We had to tap into the moral and social consciousness of the nation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am hopeful,\u201d he went on, \u201cbecause I believe in the deep moral consciousness at the heart of America. Those of us who believe in justice and who believe in freedom, we are the heartbeat of this nation. Our role now is to be like a social defibrillator, to shock the heart of the nation, to cause it to revive and to remember what the real enemy is: regressive extremism. And it\u2019s not just about winning all the elections, but changing the context in which our politicians have to operate.\u201d\n\nBarber said he hopes that the momentum of the Forward Together Moral Movement (as one of the core groups organizing Moral Marches is currently called) will spread. He sees it moving across the South from North Carolina to help change the political context and create the possibility for the state NAACP\u2019s 14-Point People\u2019s Agenda to be written into legislation both in North Carolina and beyond. The Agenda includes anti-poverty, pro-labor policies; equality and equitable distribution of resources in public education; access to healthcare for all; fairness in the criminal justice system; and protection and expansion of the right to vote and the rights of immigrants.\n\nBarber acknowledges that the neoliberal forces in his state \u2014 and across the country \u2014 remain powerful. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to fight in the courts, we\u2019ve got to fight in the legislative halls, we\u2019ve got to fight in the streets, we\u2019ve got to push at the pulpit, and we have to work at the ballot box,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we do all of this with what I call a moral critique, so we\u2019re not trapped with the language of Republican versus Democrat, I believe we can continue to work towards the reconstruction of this nation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Our role now is to be like a social defibrillator, to shock the heart of the nation, to cause it to revive and to remember what the real enemy is: regressive extremism.\"", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "BillMoyers.com", "description": "\"Our role now is to be like a social defibrillator, to shock the heart of the nation, to cause it to revive and to remember what the real enemy is: regressive extremism.\"", "title": "Rev.
