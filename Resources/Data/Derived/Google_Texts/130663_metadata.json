He is the project director at Karkemish, where the Turkish military let archaeologists resume work in 2011 for the first time since its troops occupied the site about 90 years ago.\n\n\u201cBasically, we work 20 meters away from the Islamic State-controlled areas,\u201d Marchetti said, standing at the site, which is guarded by more than 500 Turkish soldiers, tanks and artillery. \u201cStill, we have had no problem at all. \u2026 We work in a military area. It is very well-protected.\u201d\n\nThe project, which also includes archaeologists from Gaziantep and Istanbul universities, is doing the most extensive excavations at Karkemish in nearly a century, building on the work of British Museum teams that included T.E. Lawrence, the adventurer known as Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nMarchetti said the plan is to open the site to tourists next spring. A concrete barrier, about 4 yards high, will be installed at the site.\n\n\u201cThis will be a total protection for the tourists,\u201d he said.\n\nThe strategic city, its importance long known to scholars because of references in ancient texts, was under the sway of Hittites and other imperial rulers and independent kings.\n\nArchaeological investigation there was halted by World War I. It was stopped again by hostilities between Turkish nationalists and French colonizers from Syria who built machine gun nests in its defensive walls. Part of the area was mined in the 1950s and in later years, creating deadly obstacles to excavation. De-mining was completed a few years ago.\n\nArchaeologists are completing their fourth season unearthing the secrets of Karkemish along the Euphrates.\n\nThe name Karkemish means \u201cQuay of (the god) Kamis,\u201d a deity at the time in northern Syria. Stone monuments decorated with sculptures, hieroglyphics and more than 20-yard-high city walls attest to the influence of the town.\n\nAmong this year\u2019s finds were sculptures in the palace of King Katuwa, who ruled the area about 900 B.C. There were five large orthostates in limestone and basalt, a dark gray to black rock, that portray rows of individuals bearing gifts of gazelle. An orthostate is an upright stone or slab that forms part of a structure.\n\nThe archaeologists also found a mosaic floor in the palace of Sargon II, who reigned about 700 B.C. over Assyria, an ancient empire mostly located in Mesopotamia. And the team finished exploration of the ruins of the expedition house of Lawrence of Arabia, who worked at Karkemish between 1911 and 1914.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Archaeologists dig at ancient site next door to Islamic State", "title": "Archaeologists dig at ancient site next door to Islamic State", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/15/archaeologists-dig-at-ancient-site-next-door-to-islamic-state/", "image": {"width": 486, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141115__20141116_A16_ND16ARCHAEOLOGYp2.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141115__20141116_A16_ND16ARCHAEOLOGYp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-15T19:14:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T14:28:26+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdec23\"", "article_summary": "He is the project director at Karkemish, where the Turkish military let archaeologists resume work in 2011 for the first time since its troops occupied the site about 90 years ago.\nThe archaeologists also found a mosaic floor in the palace of Sargon II, who reigned about 700 B.C.\n\u201cBasically, we work 20 meters away from the Islamic State-controlled areas,\u201d Marchetti said, standing at the site, which is guarded by more than 500 Turkish soldiers, tanks and artillery.\nKarkemish, dating back more than 5,000 years, is close to the Syrian city of Jarablous, which flies the black banner of the Islamic extremist group.\nU.S.-led coalition aircraft flew overhead as Nicolo Marchetti, a professor of archaeology and art history of the Ancient Near East at the University of Bologna, worked below."}
