Of the additional three patients, two exhibited a partial response and one stable disease. The findings for this ongoing study were published in the August issue of the American Society of Clinical Oncology's Journal of Clinical Oncology.\n\nGiven the early success of these results, Arie Belldegrun, CEO of Kite Pharma, noted that the company's plan is to file an investigational new drug application with the Food and Drug Administration in the fourth quarter to run phase 1/2 studies on DLBCL patients that have failed on two or more types of existing therapies.\n\nNow what: It's hard not to be enamored with today's 92% overall response rate, or the prospect of retraining the body's own immune system to target B-cell malignancies and lymphomas. However, as a word of caution, I would also remind investors that very few immunotherapy products have successfully made it to market up to this point in time, and while the concept looks great on paper, we don't have a lot of real-world or sales efficacy to fall back on from an investable standpoint.\n\nTo add, Kite Pharma's entire pipeline, with the exception of its anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor KTE-C19 and EGFRvIII, a possible treatment for glioblastoma, is preclinical in nature. Even the company's existing clinical studies are focused on very small patient pools and still considered early stage by design. With the company valued at $1 billion following today's pop, it's probably wise for investors to take a step back and wait for more substantial results before considering Kite Pharma as a long-term investment.", "article_metadata": {"publish_time": "14:24", "date": "2014-08-26T18:24:00Z", "description": "Kite Pharma stock is among today's top gainers after the company reported positive data for its lead drug, KTE-C19, which is designed to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
