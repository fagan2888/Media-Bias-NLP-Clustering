Do you believe in the rule of law?\n\nBongino said liberals \u201ctend to give conflicting answers to this question when it involves specific legislative actions.\u201d\n\nThe former secret service agent cites how liberals have defended Obamacare by saying it\u2019s the \u201claw of the land,\u201d while criticizing current immigration laws as \u201cbroken.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be consistent and say that you believe in the rule of law if that belief means you only recommend following the laws that comport with your ideology,\u201d Bongino wrote.\n\n2. What is the safe limit for government debt?\n\nBongino said that modern liberals have \u201ccompletely abandoned\u201d fiscal responsibility, even as President Bill Clinton often spoke of balancing the federal budget fewer than 20 years ago. But now, according to Bongino, that idea \u201chas become heresy to the modern liberal.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite our national debt closing in on an astounding $20 trillion and our future liabilities doubling, tripling, or quintupling that amount depending on the estimates you use, liberals continue to whistle past the economic graveyard as if all of this red ink is somehow a net positive,\u201d Bongino said. He added that if liberals see debt as a \u201cnet positive,\u201d they should be able to say how much debt is the \u201csweet spot.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it 30 trillion? Fifty trillion? One hundred trillion? \u2026 Don\u2019t you think we\u2019re entitled to know?\u201d Bongino asked.\n\n3. What special knowledge do government bureaucrats have about the economy?\n\nBongino pointed out that modern liberal candidates no longer seem to agree with the idea that free markets create prosperity.\n\nHe cited President John F. Kennedy cutting income tax rates in the 1960s and President Bill Clinton infamously declaring in the 1990s that \u201cthe era of big government is over.\u201d He went on to draw a contrast between those two Democratic presidents\u2019 statements and President Barack Obama saying to business owners, \u201cYou didn\u2019t build that.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven this, I would like to hear from liberal candidates what special knowledge government bureaucrats have that enables them to manage the economy?\u201d Bongino asked. \u201dAre they telling us with a straight face that over 300 million Americans are simply too stupid to make their own business decisions and that a federal government\u2026is better equipped to become the largest investment portfolio manager\u2026in the history of humanity?\u201d\n\n-\n\nBongino\u2019s challenge came just hours after Ted Cruz dropped his bid for the Republican nomination for president. John Kasich, who vowed on Tuesday night to stay in the race, canceled a scheduled appearance in Virginia on Wednesday morning. He is now scheduled to speak in Columbus, Ohio, Wednesday evening, where he is reportedly set to announce his own campaign\u2019s suspension.\n\nRNC chairman Reince Priebus declared Donald Trump his party\u2019s \u201cpresumptive nominee\u201d after the billionaire businessman\u2019s crushing defeat over Ted Cruz in Indiana, while most agree that Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee.\n\n(H/T: Conservative Review)\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow the author of this story on Twitter and Facebook:\n\nFollow @jonstreet", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "Conservative commentator and former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino, in an open letter published Wednesday by the Conservative Review, issued three questions to \"liberals\" as the 2016 general election cycle is nearly underway.    \"I think it\u2019s appropriate to start asking the remaining candidates questions about the...", "creator": "@JonStreet", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2016/05/04/former-secret-service-agent-issues-challenge-to-liberals-answer-these-3-questions/", "image": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WrsJhb2_.jpg", "title": "Former Secret Service Agent Issues \u2018Challenge\u2019 to Liberals: \u2018Answer These 3 Questions\u2019", "site": "@theblaze", "card": "summary", "account_id": 1512944287}, "keywords": "former, secret, service, agent, dan, bongino, issues, challenge, liberals, 2016, general, election, gets, underway", "sailthru.tags": "campaign-2016, donald-trump, hillary-clinton, politics, author-jon-street, site-theblazecom", "facebook-count": 1559, "gplus-count": 5, "msapplication-TileColor": "#282b2d", "sailthru.guid": "theblazecom/1113578", "categories": "campaign-2016,donald-trump,hillary-clinton,politics", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/medium150x150.png", "comment-count": 140, "description": "Conservative commentator and former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino, in an open letter published Wednesday by the Conservative Review, issued three questions to \"liberals\" as the 2016 general election cycle is nearly underway.    \"I think it\u2019s appropriate to start asking the remaining candidates questions about the...", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/wide310x150.png", "linkedin-count": 0, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/small70x70.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/plugins/theblaze_livetile/img/large310x310.png", "fb": {"admins": 517831498}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.theblaze.com/", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"site_name": "The Blaze", "description": "Conservative commentator and former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino, in an open letter published Wednesday by the Conservative Review, issued three questions to \"liberals\" as the 2016 general election cycle is nearly underway.    \"I think it\u2019s appropriate to start asking the remaining candidates questions about the...", "title": "Former Secret Service Agent Issues \u2018Challenge\u2019 to Liberals: \u2018Answer These 3 Questions\u2019", "url": "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2016/05/04/former-secret-service-agent-issues-challenge-to-liberals-answer-these-3-questions/", "image": {"width": 282, "identifier": "http://www.theblaze.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/WrsJhb2_.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 282}, "type": "article"}, "dc.date": "2016-05-04T13:44:07+00:00", "twitter-count": 0}, "article_summary": "Conservative commentator and former Secret Service agent Dan Bongino, in an open letter published Wednesday by the Conservative Review, issued three questions to \u201cliberals\u201d as the 2016 general election cycle is nearly underway.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s appropriate to start asking the remaining candidates questions about the ideology that guides their decision-making,\u201d Bongino wrote.\nBongino said that modern liberals have \u201ccompletely abandoned\u201d fiscal responsibility, even as President Bill Clinton often spoke of balancing the federal budget fewer than 20 years ago.\nBongino pointed out that modern liberal candidates no longer seem to agree with the idea that free markets create prosperity.\nexecutive amnesty, Obamacare, foreign policy) he disregarded what he said and took actions guided by his big\u2013government-knows-best ideology.\u201dWith that, Bongino issued a \u201cchallenge\u201d to liberals to \u201canswer these three questions.\u201d1."}
