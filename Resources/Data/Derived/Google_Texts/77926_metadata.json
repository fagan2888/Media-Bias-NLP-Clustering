Not only do inmates develop debilitating conditions at a younger age than people who are not incarcerated, but caring for them in the harsh environment of prisons is far more expensive than it is on the outside.\n\nOf the 2.3 million adults in state and federal prisons, about 246,000 are 50 or older, according to the National Institute of Corrections. The U.S. currently spends more than $16 billion annually caring for these aging inmates, and their numbers are projected to grow dramatically in the next 15 years.\n\n\u201cIn a couple of years,\u201d said Donna Strugar-Fritsch, a consultant with Health Management Associates, \u201cthis is the only thing people are going to be talking about. It\u2019s getting worse by the minute.\u201d\n\nRelated: What '60 Minutes' Got Right and Wrong About Aging\n\nIn the last five years, a handful of states have tried to contract with private nursing homes to care for some of their elderly and disabled inmates under so-called \u201cmedical parole\u201d programs that allow prisoners to receive care outside of a prison while remaining in state custody. But few private facilities have been willing to accept them. Likewise, courts and communities have tended to resist so-called \u201ccompassionate release,\u201d which cuts short the sentences of elderly or dying inmates so they can spend their last days on the outside.\n\nTwo years ago, Connecticut tried a different approach. Instead of attempting to place prisoners in nursing home beds next to someone\u2019s elderly parent, the state asked the commercial nursing home industry to provide a facility that would accept a steady stream of prison inmates and patients from the state mental hospital who required long-term nursing care.\n\nA handful of states are interested in following Connecticut\u2019s lead; Michigan is seeking industry proposals for a similar arrangement, and Kentucky and Wisconsin are considering doing the same. But in other states, officials may lack the political will to take on residents who don\u2019t want convicts in their midst. And even in Connecticut, it remains to be seen how far the state can take its plan, given the public backlash it already has experienced.\n\nRelated: State Prisons Break Away from Soaring Cost Trends\n\nTechnically, the winning bidder for Connecticut\u2019s corrections business, 60 West, is just like any other nursing home. It is not locked down, does not employ guards and it accepts applications from anyone. Located in Rocky Hill, the 95-bed nursing facility opened in May 2013 and is already half-full. Its only residents are patients transferred from state prisons and Connecticut Valley Hospital, the state\u2019s only residential mental institution.\n\nBesides providing more humane and less expensive care than Connecticut\u2019s prisons can offer, 60 West is certified to receive federal Medicaid payments. As a result, the state\u2019s taxpayers will save more than $5 million in corrections health care costs annually, once 60 West is filled.\n\nMedicaid on the Outside\n\nUnder the 1965 law that created Medicaid, anybody entering a state prison forfeited Medicaid eligibility. The same went for those entering local jails, juvenile lock-ups and state mental institutions. But an exception to that general rule opened up in 1997 when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services wrote to state Medicaid directors saying inmates who leave state or local facilities for care in hospitals or nursing homes can get their bills paid by Medicaid. The exact federal contribution varies by state. But in all of them, Washington covers at least half the costs of the federal-state health care program for the poor.\n\nIn addition to the incarcerated, those on probation or parole or under house arrest can participate. Even in states that have not expanded Medicaid to low-income adults under the Affordable Care Act, most elderly or disabled prison inmates qualify under existing Medicaid rules, as long as they receive care outside.\n\nRelated: How Hepatitis C Could Wallop the U.S. in Next Decades\n\nThat means some portion of the nation\u2019s elderly and disabled inmates could receive federally-subsidized long-term care outside of prison walls, potentially saving states millions of dollars in health care costs.\n\nAging Quickly\n\nThe prison population in Connecticut is aging faster than in most other states and its growth is not expected to subside any time soon. Between 2007 and 2011, the proportion of inmates age 55 and older increased 45 percent, according to a survey by the Pew Charitable Trusts and the Association of State Correctional Administrators. Nationwide, the number of elderly inmates is projected to more than triple in the next 15 years, according to data compiled by the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nThe rise in older prisoners is partly a result of tough-on-crime laws in the 1980s and 1990s, including mandatory minimum sentences and \u201cthree strikes\u201d rules. It also reflects the aging of the U.S. population generally. Prisoners, like everyone else, are living longer. Many elderly inmates came into the prison system late in life, some after serving previous sentences. Others are serving lengthy sentences because of the nature of their crimes.\n\nBedridden, in wheel chairs, and often suffering from dementia, elderly prisoners cost more than twice as much to care for as their younger counterparts, and most pose little threat to society. In prison infirmaries, they are often preyed upon by healthier inmates. \u201cPrisons aren\u2019t equipped philosophically, legally, or personnel-wise to deal with the elderly in any way,\u201d Strugar-Fritsch said. \u201cIt\u2019s already a failed experiment for prisons to be serving as mental institutions. It will be another failed experiment if prisons try to serve as nursing homes.\u201d\n\nRelated: America Follows Japan's Lead on Aging at Our Peril\n\nNevertheless, some states have resorted to building new nursing facilities within prison walls, a costly undertaking that excludes the possibility of Medicaid payments. With prison infirmaries filled to capacity and few outside facilities willing to accept their elderly and infirm inmates, they saw no other choice.\n\nIn California, for example, where about 136,000 people are incarcerated, efforts to find nursing home beds or community\u2013based care on the outside has so far yielded only about 60 placements, according to the system\u2019s legislative director, Joyce Hayhoe. To fulfill its health care requirements under a federal court order, the state last year built a 2,950 bed long-term and intermediate care facility in Stockton \u2013 the largest in the country \u2013 at a cost of $900 million. According to Hayhoe, the state intentionally did not take Connecticut\u2019s approach because of concerns about community reaction.\n\nUnhappy Neighbors\n\nEven if California and other states could find enough beds in private nursing homes to care for their elderly and disabled inmates, not all of them would be eligible. Those with recent disciplinary actions, for example, are generally not considered candidates for medical parole. Sex offenders can be difficult to place because of state laws restricting where they can live. A large proportion of elderly inmates are serving lengthy sentences for crimes such as rape or murder. Many will die in prison because communities are unwilling to accept them.\n\nRocky Hill is no exception. Residents of the town of 20,000, just south of Hartford, protested on the steps of the Connecticut State Capitol, filed a court injunction and lobbied lawmakers to pass a law allowing them to overrule the state\u2019s decision to contract with 60 West.\n\nThey were unsuccessful, but so far, there have been no incidents. Two inmates were transferred back to prison because of minor behavioral problems, but no employees have been injured and local residents have not complained. \u201cWe have over a year in the bank now without incident,\u201d said Mike Lawlor, Connecticut\u2019s undersecretary for criminal justice. \u201cThe permanent solution is not one nursing home. If the current trend holds there may be more dedicated nursing facilities in the future.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in Stateline, a nonpartisan, nonprofit news service of the Pew Center on the States that provides daily reporting and analysis on trends in state policy.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Providing health care to an aging prison population is a large and growing cost for st", "title": "The Growing Cost of Aging Inmates: $16B and Counting", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/12/Growing-Cost-Aging-Inmates-16B-and-Counting", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02092011_prison_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/08/12/Growing-Cost-Aging-Inmates-16B-and-Counting", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02092011_prison_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Providing health care to an aging prison population is a large and growing cost for st", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf966\"", "article_summary": "Providing health care to an aging prison population is a large and growing cost for states.\nA large proportion of elderly inmates are serving lengthy sentences for crimes such as rape or murder.\nBut in all of them, Washington covers at least half the costs of the federal-state health care program for the poor.\nMedicaid on the OutsideUnder the 1965 law that created Medicaid, anybody entering a state prison forfeited Medicaid eligibility.\nNationwide, the number of elderly inmates is projected to more than triple in the next 15 years, according to data compiled by the American Civil Liberties Union."}
