Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Chuck Grassley Chuck GrassleyOvernight Cybersecurity: Guccifer plea deal raises questions in Clinton probe Could Romanian hacker \u2018Guccifer\u2019 assist FBI\u2019s probe of Clinton? Senate panel delays email privacy vote amid concerns MORE (R-Iowa) on Tuesday released their investigation of the pricing decision-making by Gilead Sciences, Inc., maker of the Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which had drawn widespread attention for being priced at $84,000 for a 12-week treatment.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe evidence shows that the company pursued a calculated scheme for pricing and marketing its Hepatitis C drug based on one goal: maximizing revenue regardless of the human consequences,\u201d Wyden said at a press conference.\n\nGrassley\u2019s involvement comes as some Republicans have shown signs of movement on the drug pricing issue. Some Republicans, like Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), still staunchly defend the industry, saying it needs high prices to recoup research and development costs.\n\nOn the other hand, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), along with Grassley, recently renewed a call for the administration and Congress to act to allow imports of cheaper drugs from Canada, a move strongly opposed by the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) has likewise launched a bipartisan investigation into two companies that have dramatically hiked the price of drugs.\n\nAsked on Tuesday whether Republicans are starting to change their tune on drug pricing, Grassley said he hopes his investigation promotes \u201cdiscussion\u201d of the issue.\n\n\u201cMy hope is that the fact that this has been a bipartisan investigation, that this inquiry will be a wake-up call in terms of the challenges ahead,\u201d Wyden added.\n\nThe report finds that Gilead priced its drug based simply on maximizing revenue, not on recouping research and development costs.\n\nOne slide from a company presentation obtained by the senators shows that the company mapped out the \u201clikelihood of public outcry\u201d for different potential prices of the drug.\n\nOne official writes in an email, \u201cLet\u2019s not fold to advocacy pressure in 2014,\u201d adding, \u2018\u2018Let\u2019s hold our position whatever competitors do or whatever the headlines.\u2019\u2019\n\nGilead defended its prices in a statement Tuesday, arguing that its drug is a major improvement in Hepatitis C treatment and saves money down the road by reducing the need to pay for managing the condition long-term.\n\n\u201cWe stand behind the pricing of our therapies because of the benefit they bring to patients and the significant value they represent to payers, providers, and our entire healthcare system by reducing the long-term costs associated with managing chronic HCV,\u201d the company said.\n\nThe company also noted that there are rebates and discounts in place.\n\nThe Senate report acknowledged that competition from other companies has now helped lower the price of the drug, but warned that more high-priced drugs are in the pipeline. In particular, the senators warned of the burden paying for these drugs places on Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nGrassley indicated openness to paying for drugs based on \u201cvalue\u201d or how much of an improvement in health they are shown to have.\n\nThe Obama administration is also exploring this idea. The White House held a forum on drug prices last month.\n\nGrassley noted the administration\u2019s goal of shifting Medicare to pay for quality over quantity and reward value in 50 percent of its payments by 2018.\n\n\u201cWe've considered value to some extent [in other healthcare areas], now we're moving towards it by 2018,\u201d Grassley said. \u201cI'd like to have you consider my use of value in those same terms.\u201d\n\nGrassley said the report was just the beginning of a discussion on policy changes, and added that process might take two to three months. But he said the problem deserves scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThe federal government is also a major payer for those drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are $18 trillion in debt, so what we spend on Medicare and Medicaid ought to get a lot of attention.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The senators raised alarm about the $84,000 cost for the drug.", "description": "The senators raised alarm about the $84,000 cost for the drug.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Peter Sullivan", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The senators raised alarm about the $84,000 cost for the drug.", "title": "Bipartisan Senate report denounces high price of Hep C drug", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/261661-bipartisan-senate-report-denounces-high-drug-price", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/pills_medication_prescription_022509getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-01T14:15:25-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-12-01T14:15-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/261661-bipartisan-senate-report-denounces-high-drug-price", "dcterms.date": "2015-12-01T14:02-05:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Peter Sullivan", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Ron Wyden, Gilead Sciences, Specialty drugs,Chuck Grassley,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-01T14:02:39-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-01T14:15:25-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/261661-bipartisan-senate-report-denounces-high-drug-price", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The senators raised alarm about the $84,000 cost for the drug.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bipartisan Senate report denounces high price of Hep C drug"}, "dcterms.title": "Bipartisan Senate report denounces high price of Hep C drug"}, "article_summary": "A new bipartisan Senate report is taking a drug company to task for charging $84,000 for a medicine, a move senators hope will spark discussion of drug prices in Congress.\nGrassley\u2019s involvement comes as some Republicans have shown signs of movement on the drug pricing issue.\nAsked on Tuesday whether Republicans are starting to change their tune on drug pricing, Grassley said he hopes his investigation promotes \u201cdiscussion\u201d of the issue.\nThe Senate report acknowledged that competition from other companies has now helped lower the price of the drug, but warned that more high-priced drugs are in the pipeline.\nThe White House held a forum on drug prices last month."}
