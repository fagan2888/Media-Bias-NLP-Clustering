Like his father, Ron Paul\u2014the man who defined libertarianism for most Americans\u2014Rand can be a thorn in the side of his own Republican Party. He proved that in an interview last Wednesday when he blamed the defense hawks in the GOP for the rise of ISIS.\n\n\u201cRight now there are 1,500 groups in the Mideast, many of them bad people like those in ISIS that hawks in our party have been arming\u2026. ISIS exists and grew stronger because of the hawks in our party who gave arms indiscriminately, and most of those arms were snatched up by ISIS. These hawks also wanted to bomb [Syrian President Bashar] Assad, which would have made ISIS\u2019s job even easier,\u201d Paul said.\n\nPeter King (R-NY), presumably one of the accused \u201chawks,\u201d wasn\u2019t about to let that comment pass without a rejoinder. On Thursday he told Andrea Mitchell of NBC: \u201cI think Rand Paul should be a leading contender for the Democratic nomination for president\u2026.\u201d He called Paul \u201ctotally unqualified to be commander-in-chief.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Attacks Clinton from the Right and the Left\n\nThe outspoken junior senator from Kentucky has an odd mix of supporters on both ends of the political spectrum \u2014young and old, traditional and what some might call radical. He thinks incarcerating people for minor drug crimes is a bad idea, and most people agree with him. Of course, few understand that some, if not many, of those incarcerations are plea deals from higher crimes. He also introduced a bill legalizing medical marijuana, which appealed to a variety of different groups.\n\nPaul is most vulnerable on his defense flip-flop. He thinks the U.S. fails every time it sends troops to fight in foreign countries like Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. But his isolationist approach hasn\u2019t resonated with his party or with America\u2019s 21.8 million veterans (not including their families), who tend to vote.\n\nHere are some of his more memorable quotes:\n\nBlame the Hawks in the GOP and\u2026. \u201cOne of the people I blame for a lot of this, frankly, is Hillary Clinton. The disaster that is Libya is now a breeding ground for terrorists and also a breeding ground for armament. I really do blame Hillary Clinton\u2019s war in Libya for creating a lot of the chaos that is now spreading throughout the Middle East. ISIS is all over Libya because these same hawks in my party loved Hillary Clinton\u2019s war in Libya, but Libya\u2019s a failed state and it\u2019s a disaster. So is Iraq or [it is] a vassal state of Iran.\u201d\n\nThe Patriot Act: \u201cI will not let the Patriot Act, the most unpatriotic of acts, go unchallenged. At the very least, we should debate whether or not we can live within the Constitution, or whether or not we have to go around the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don't know who the next group is that's unpopular. The Bill of Rights isn't for the prom queen. The Bill of Rights isn't for the high school quarterback. The Bill of Rights is for the least among us. The bill of rights is for minorities. The bill of rights is for those who have minority opinions.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rand Paul Didn\u2019t Halt NSA Surveillance. A Divided Congress Did\n\nSugar Daddy Uncle Sam: \u201cWe\u2019re borrowing money from China to send it to Germany. We\u2019re borrowing money from China to send it Pakistan. There is an end point at which the system unravels if we\u2019re not careful.\u201d\n\nOn Taxes and Big Government:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s curious that only in Washington can you spend $2 billion and claim that you\u2019re saving money.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would not appoint anyone to head the Department of Commerce. I would say I\u2019m not spending the money.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president says he doesn\u2019t know where he can cut. How about we start with the $2.4 million we've spent on origami condoms!\u201d\n\nWhat Social Safety Net? \u201cAs humans, yeah, we do have an obligation to give people water, to give people food, to give people health care. But it\u2019s not a right because once you conscript people and say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s a right,\u2019 then really you\u2019re in charge, it\u2019s servitude, you\u2019re in charge of me and I\u2019m supposed to do whatever you tell me to do\u2026 It really shouldn\u2019t be seen that way.\u201d\n\nOn the Human Condition: \u201c[Being] married with kids versus unmarried with kids is the difference between living in poverty and not. We should sell that message. Not in a mean way to tell people who already have made a bad decision, but if you\u2019ve had one child and you\u2019re not married, you shouldn\u2019t have another one.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from the Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Rand Paul likes to shake things up.", "title": "Rand Paul Unfiltered: 6 Straight-from-the-Hip Quotes", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/29/Rand-Paul-Unfiltered-6-Straight-Hip-Quotes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-paul_2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/29/Rand-Paul-Unfiltered-6-Straight-Hip-Quotes", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-election-paul_2.jpg", "creator": "@jackieleo", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Rand Paul likes to shake things up.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Rand Paul likes to shake things up.\nThe bill of rights is for those who have minority opinions.\u201dRelated: Rand Paul Didn\u2019t Halt NSA Surveillance.\nThese hawks also wanted to bomb [Syrian President Bashar] Assad, which would have made ISIS\u2019s job even easier,\u201d Paul said.\nOn Thursday he told Andrea Mitchell of NBC: \u201cI think Rand Paul should be a leading contender for the Democratic nomination for president\u2026.\u201d He called Paul \u201ctotally unqualified to be commander-in-chief.\u201dRelated: Rand Paul Attacks Clinton from the Right and the LeftThe outspoken junior senator from Kentucky has an odd mix of supporters on both ends of the political spectrum \u2014young and old, traditional and what some might call radical.\nPeter King (R-NY), presumably one of the accused \u201chawks,\u201d wasn\u2019t about to let that comment pass without a rejoinder."}
