He seemed bewildered.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\n\u201cEnter your motion to reconsider,\u201d Laura Dove, his chief floor aide, told the majority leader, the exchange audible throughout the chamber. \u201cYou need to enter your motion to reconsider.\u201d\n\nMcConnell has studied Senate procedure firsthand over five decades, and there is not much that can leave him flummoxed, even momentarily. But here he stood \u2014 thanks to, of all people, his fellow Republican, fellow Kentuckian, close political ally and the man he has endorsed for president \u2014 Sen. Rand Paul.\n\nWith a dramatic series of procedural maneuvers, Paul had just dashed McConnell\u2019s public pledge to extend a controversial National Security Agency surveillance program beyond a June 1 deadline before the Senate left for a week-long holiday break. The program allows the government agency to collect vast troves of call data from telephone companies as part of the fight against international terrorism. Paul sees it as a violation of individual privacy.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe early-morning antics not only complicated senators\u2019 vacations but created a new chapter in the evolving relationship between McConnell and Paul, who have come to symbolize the once-tenuous but now increasingly comfortable ties between tea party conservatism and the Republican Party mainstream.\n\nMcConnell, the consummate insider, and Paul, the populist firebrand, have become increasingly close since Paul crushed McConnell\u2019s hand-picked Senate candidate in the 2010 Republican primary \u2014 culminating with Paul campaigning strenuously last year for McConnell\u2019s sixth Senate term, and McConnell returning the favor this year with an endorsement of Paul\u2019s presidential bid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed a very tight relationship, and I\u2019m for him,\u201d he told the Lexington Herald-Leader last year.\n\nTheir paths have now diverged. Paul is seeking to motivate his activist base with a mantra of \u201cdefeat the Washington machine\u201d as he tries to distinguish himself in a crowded GOP presidential field, while McConnell is trying to corral his fellow Republican senators to govern effectively to boost the party\u2019s standing ahead of the 2016 elections.\n\nRead the rest of the story here.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WaPo: Mitch McConnell's Relationship with Rand Paul Falling Apart", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "WaPo: Mitch McConnell's Relationship with Rand Paul Falling Apart", "title": "WaPo: Mitch McConnell's Relationship with Rand Paul Falling Apart - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/kentucky-senate-mcconnell-paul-ap-e1432503994144.jpg", "height": 486}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/05/24/wapo-mitch-mcconnells-relationship-with-rand-paul-falling-apart/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "WaPo: Mitch McConnell's Relationship with Rand Paul Falling Apart", "title": "WaPo: Mitch McConnell's Relationship with Rand Paul Falling Apart - Breitbart", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/05/kentucky-senate-mcconnell-paul-ap-e1432503994144.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Kentucky Senator, Mitch McConnell, Rand Paul, U.S. Senate,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Tea party,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "tag": "U.S. Senate", "published_time": "2015-05-24T14:46:43-07:00", "categories": "Big Government,2016 Presidential Race,Tea party"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde312\"", "article_summary": "But here he stood \u2014 thanks to, of all people, his fellow Republican, fellow Kentuckian, close political ally and the man he has endorsed for president \u2014 Sen.
