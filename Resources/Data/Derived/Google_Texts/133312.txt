Some of President Barack Obama’s friends in Hollywood have decided to help promote the Affordable Care Act through a new video filled with twerking and teddy bears … well sort of.

Set to a string of pop hits, actors parody Miley Cyrus, Rihanna, Drake and rapper 2 Chainz in the music video, which was created by the Fung Brothers. The short film, called Healthcare Swag, details all the changes enacted under Obamacare and reassures viewers all their healthcare woes will be solved.

“You need healthcare, affordable healthcare,” sings an actress portraying Miley Cyrus to the singer’s ‘We Can’t Stop.’ “If you don’t have it you can’t mess up, hurt yourself twerkin’ in the club.”

The video continues, boasting a mashup of popular songs like Drake’s “Started from the Bottom” and Rihanna’s “Umbrella,” and details how the health insurance marketplaces work. Additionally, it goes on to explain the potential refunds consumers can receive from health insurance companies.

“They gon’ spend 80 percent of ya premium,” sings a pseudo-Rihanna. “Or you will get a refund. Your healthcare will be betta, betta, so don’t worry about ya chedda, ella.”

The end of the music video gives viewers directions on how to register for Obamacare’s exchanges and reminds them purchasing health insurance is now required by law.

“Cuz it can’t stop. And it won’t stop,” the Miley Cyrus look-a-like sings. “Don’t play dumb or dumb you’ll be, have you seen a bill for surgery?”
