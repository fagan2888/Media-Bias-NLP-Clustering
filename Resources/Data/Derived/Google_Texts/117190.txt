Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders unveiled his immigration plan on Tuesday with promises to build on President Obama’s executive actions in a way that “keeps families together.”

Drawing a sharp contrast with Donald Trump’s border plans, Sanders said border security can be improved by investing in new technologies, and not by building “boondoggle walls” or militarizing border communities.

Sanders’ immigration plan appears to be the most progressive put forth so far by the field of presidential hopefuls, including his Democratic challengers. It even seems to go into more detail than some of the statements by the Clinton camp.
