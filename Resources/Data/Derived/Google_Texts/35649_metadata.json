Even though the 2013 hurricane season has been one of the weakest in decades, the recent flooding in Colorado, wildfires in California, and tornadoes throughout the Midwest have left thousands of Americans homeless, hoping that their insurance covers the damage.\n\nSuch events may be occurring with even more frequency in coming years, as climate change has many experts predicting an increase in natural disasters, with our region expected to be particularly hard hit. A report released last year by Munich Re, the world\u2019s biggest reinsurance firm declared that \u201cnowhere in the world is the rising number of natural catastrophes more evident than in North America.\u201d Even so, just 36 percent of Americans said they had made preparations for disaster, according to a study last year by YouGov.\n\nRELATED: 10 DEVASTATING NATURAL DISASTERS OF THE PAST DECADE\n\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to fully mitigate the risks posed by a natural disaster, there are steps families can long before disaster strikes that will help protect their homes and their finances.\n\nPlan ahead: Have a family meeting to devise a plan of the steps each person would take in the event of an emergency and the items for which they\u2019d be responsible in the event of an evacuation. Write down everyone\u2019s role and keep the list in an easily accessible place, including smart phones. Make sure all adults in your family know how to turn off utilities like gas and electricity. \u201cIf you wait until a crisis to start making decisions, you\u2019ll make sub-optimal choices and forget things,\u2019 says Harry Rhulen, author of Disaster Ready People for a Disaster Ready America.\n\nIf you have children in school, determine who will pick them up during a disaster. Select a meeting place where your family will gather if separated or unable to return home, and designate an out-of-state family member with whom everyone should call and check in. Send that person (or keep in a safe deposit box) copies of any documents like deeds, wills, and vehicle titles, which you might not have access to after a disaster.\n\nUse a video camera or an app like the one offered by the Insurance Information Institute to take an inventory of all your jewelry, electronics and other valuable belongings, so that you\u2019ll have easy access to it if you need to make an insurance claim.\n\nGather Supplies: You\u2019ll want to create two emergency kits, one with supplies for your home and the other with items you\u2019d need to take with you in a car in the event of an evacuation. Both kits should include basic first aid supplies, a flashlight, a few hundred dollars in cash (since ATM machines may not be working), drinking water, and nutrition bars. Your at-home stash should also include several days\u2019 worth of nonperishable food, a manual can opener, a battery-powered radio, and any medication family members might need. (If you have pets, don\u2019t forget to include enough food and water for them as well.)\n\nIf you live in a home that\u2019s prone to power outages after severe storms or snow, having a professionally installed generator could make it safer and easier to stay in your home. A working sump pump is a must-have for homes that are subject to flooding. Keep at least one corded phone and a solar-powered cell phone charger. Remember, when phone lines are down and cell towers are jammed, you may have more luck getting out text messages than placing voice calls.\n\nCheck Your Insurance: Two in three homes are underinsured, according to Nationwide Insurance, putting millions of people at risk for a financial disaster following a natural one. Homes should be insured for the amount it would cost to rebuild, not for their current value in the real estate market.\n\nIn addition to getting the valuation right, take a close look at the terms and conditions of the policy itself to make sure that you\u2019ve got appropriate coverage. \u201cInsurers have been sharpening the exclusions and limitations on policies and reacting to disasters by eliminating or capping coverage for certain hazards,\u201d says Amy Bach, executive director of United Policyholders, a consumer advocacy group. \u201cThat requires consumers to be more proactive to fill in the coverage gaps.\u201d\n\nRELATED: HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES MAY ROCK YOUR INSURANCE\n\nHomeowners who live anywhere near a body of water should purchase flood coverage via the National Flood Insurance Program. That coverage is capped at $250,000. If you need more than that, some private insurers will sell you supplemental coverage that kicks in after you\u2019ve claimed the $250,000.\n\nYou may also need additional coverage for earthquakes, mold, landslides, or wind damage caused by hurricanes or tornadoes. Most policies do cover wildfire damage, but some require that you have your home fire-proofed to their standards. Enter your zip code at DisasterSafety.org to see to which risks your home is most vulnerable. Keep in mind that many wind and earthquake policies can include a deductible of 2 percent to 10 percent of a home\u2019s value, so you should make sure that your emergency fund has enough cash to cover that.\n\nGet Your Home in Shape: If you live in a hurricane- or tornado-prone area, installing permanent, wind-proof shutters could protect your property from falling trees and flying debris. Garage doors are also particularly vulnerable in such storms, so consider up-grading to a stormproof version.\n\nHomeowners in an earthquake zone should make sure their property is up to code, and secure large, heavy objects like bookcases and appliances to the walls. Those vulnerable to wildfires should move vegetation and yard debris away from their home and use make sure that all landscaping and building materials is flame-resistant.\n\nStill, while you can lower the risk of damage, the worst natural disasters will make short work of such preparations, which is why it\u2019s so important to have a safety plan and proper insurance. \u201cThere\u2019s really only so much you can do in terms of home improvement when you\u2019re going head-to-head with Mother Nature,\u201d says Jim Cobb, author of Prepper\u2019s Home Defense.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "While it\u2019s impossible to fully mitigate the risks posed by a natural disaster, there are steps that families can take before a storm that will help protect their homes and finances in the event of a disaster.", "title": "4 Steps to Disaster-Proof Your Home and Finances", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/10/18/4-Steps-Disaster-Proof-Your-Home-and-Finances", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01282011_Disaster_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2013/10/18/4-Steps-Disaster-Proof-Your-Home-and-Finances", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/01282011_Disaster_article.jpg", "creator": "@bethbrav", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "While it\u2019s impossible to fully mitigate the risks posed by a natural disaster, there are steps that families can take before a storm that will help protect their homes and finances in the event of a disaster.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc050\"", "article_summary": "RELATED: 10 DEVASTATING NATURAL DISASTERS OF THE PAST DECADEWhile it\u2019s impossible to fully mitigate the risks posed by a natural disaster, there are steps families can long before disaster strikes that will help protect their homes and their finances.\nSuch events may be occurring with even more frequency in coming years, as climate change has many experts predicting an increase in natural disasters, with our region expected to be particularly hard hit.\nYou may also need additional coverage for earthquakes, mold, landslides, or wind damage caused by hurricanes or tornadoes.\nMake sure all adults in your family know how to turn off utilities like gas and electricity.\nStill, while you can lower the risk of damage, the worst natural disasters will make short work of such preparations, which is why it\u2019s so important to have a safety plan and proper insurance."}
