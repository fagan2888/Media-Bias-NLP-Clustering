Wichita Police were called to the shootings of three people in the first hours of 2016.

Two people were shot around 3:45 a.m. in the area of Lincoln and Broadway. Dispatchers say officers found 40 bullet holes in a building, along with a wounded man and woman.

Unconfirmed reports indicate the woman is shot in the lower back, while the man was wounded in the arm. But were hospitalized in serious condition.

Neighbors tell KAKE News the building is used as a private club and they often see and hear gunfire.

"I have to go to work at 3:30 in the morning," said neighbor Edith McDonald. "So when I come down these steps at 2:30, this club is still going, I don't know if they are going to be fighting or shooting."

A friend of the building's owner says there was a New Year's Eve party going on when some unwanted guests arrived and started shooting at the building.

Initial reports said there were 40 bullet holes in the building.

KAKE archives show that location was also the scene of a shooting on September 6, 2015.

Earlier in the night, a man was shot in the chest in northeast Wichita. But police believe that shooting was accidental, at a home near 26th and North Madison.

Unconfirmed reports indicate a 35-year-old man was wounded, and taken to Wesley Medical Center in critical condition.
