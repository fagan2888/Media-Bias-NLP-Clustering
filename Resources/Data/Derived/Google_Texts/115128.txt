The 2014 contribution limit for Roth IRAs is $5,500 ($6,500 if you're age 50 or older). You can contribute up to the limit unless you earn less than that amount. You cannot contribute more than your taxable compensation for the year.

In addition to an absolute limit, there are income limits to contributing to a Roth IRA. The following table shows how much you can contribute depending on your marital status for tax purposes and your income. If you fall in the "reduced amount" category, your contribution amount is phased out linearly. For example, if you are single and earn $119,000, you fall one-third of the way into the phase-out range. (The range is $114,000 to $129,000, a range of $15,000, and you fall $5,000 into the range and $5,000 is one-third of the $15,000 range.) Since you are one-third of the way into the phase-out range, you would lose one-third of your contribution limit. This would leave you with a contribution limit of $3,333 (two-thirds of $5,000 is $3,333). For more details on this calculation, please visit the IRS website.

The backdoor Roth IRA for high-income earners

While there are income limits on who can contribute to a Roth IRA and who can deduct contributions to a Traditional IRA, there are no longer limits on who can convert a Traditional IRA to a Roth. This means that anyone, regardless of income, can contribute to a Traditional IRA and immediately convert it to a Roth IRA.
