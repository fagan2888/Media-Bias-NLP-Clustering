A. Hayek called \u201cthe Fatal Conceit.\u201d\n\nWhile in the Hawkeye State, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s fabrications \u2014 no doubt so frequent due to an overdose of Liagra \u2014 included the lie that \u201call my grandparents, you know, came over here (as immigrants).\u201d Even the liberals at PolitiFact point out that only one of her four grandparents was not born in the United States.\n\nStill, let\u2019s engage in a willing suspension of disbelief and take Mrs. Clinton at her word when she explained, \u201cbefore I roll out my policies, I want to hear from you on the front lines.\u201d She added that she wants to \u201cbuild on what works\u201d in Obamacare and, as the liberal British Guardian newspaper put it, she \u201cleans left out of Iowa with a bold progressive checklist.\u201d\n\nI understand: You\u2019re trying not to laugh when I suggest going along with Hillary\u2019s claim that she really wants to hear from the people before putting out a platform, rather than that she\u2019s basically doing her own polling to find out what she can get away with politically and avoiding giving the media and her Republican competitors fodder for hard questions. But again, let\u2019s say she means it. Is that actually a sign of something good?\n\nHillary, in addition to being a prototypical Wellesley radical coed smitten with Saul Alinsky, has an unfading Progressive streak running through her every condescending and elitist thought. Namely, she believes that she and other smart people and \u201cexperts\u201d are so much wiser than you or I \u2014 it\u2019s a wonder we can even make it through our pathetic work days \u2014 that we ought to gratefully accept a technocratic bureaucracy of ivory tower-cloistered PhDs whose beneficence should be given control over every important aspect of our lives.\n\nThe problem, as Hayek point out, is that no expert or group of experts could ever hope to \u201cgenerate and garner greater knowledge\u201d than can all of us troglodyte participants and believers in \u201cspontaneously generated moral traditions underlying the competitive market order\u201d as we manage our own businesses, know our own customers, suppliers, employees, local market peculiarities, etc.\n\nTherefore, \u201cwhat works\u201d in any government program is usually some provision that would have been unnecessary but for prior actions by government \u201cexperts\u201d who created a problem to begin with. Obamacare is a perfect example: essentially all of the aspects of American health insurance that consumers objected to prior to Obamacare resulted from government restricting competition within that market so that, for example, a resident of California is (still) not allowed to buy a much cheaper plan from Idaho.\n\nYes, Obamacare has helped alleviate a few problems, including some undoubtedly bad behavior by insurers, but competition would have done the same thing for trillions of dollars less. There\u2019s a reason that Americans are generally happy with every kind of insurance other than health insurance: it\u2019s the one insurance market that most feels the dead hand of government regulation. Even the ridiculous structure of the health insurance market whereby premiums are deductible for companies but not individuals (although that situation has been slightly rectified in recent years) was caused by government.\n\nBooks have been written about the flaws in, and costs of, Obamacare. But my point is a larger one: Hillary, like all elitist Progressives, believes that the only solution to human needs or problems \u2014 including problems caused by government \u2014 is more government.\n\nAnd again, it\u2019s not just that she believes in the goodness of government, which she does, even if it\u2019s secondary to her own hunger for power; it\u2019s that she disbelieves in the power and goodness of individuals living and enriching their own lives through the billions of daily voluntary transactions by which Adam Smith\u2019s \u201cinvisible hand\u201d operates.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Obamacare. It\u2019s everything.\n\nOn Tuesday at a staged roundtable at Kirkwood Community College in Iowa, Hillary ticked off a small number of campaign themes, promising more later (in what unfortunately is one of the few things she\u2019s telling the truth about.) These included:\n\nGovernment \u201caddressing the economy of tomorrow, not yesterday,\u201d\n\n\u201cStrengthening families and communities,\u201d\n\n\u201cGetting the uncontrolled money out of politics again,\u201d and\n\n\u201cProtecting our country\u201d\n\nWell, one out of four ain\u2019t bad. Protecting our country is indeed the primary and most fundamental function of government. That said, the woman who spearheaded the most feckless and self-destructive American foreign policy for a century hardly seems like the right \u201cchampion\u201d for that particular cause.\n\nBut let\u2019s look at the other three \u2014 while noting that \u201cprotecting our country\u201d was last on her short list.\n\nDoes any rational person believe that government is more likely to come up with the next world-changing technology than the private sector is? Even Hillary probably doesn\u2019t believe that, so what is government\u2019s role in \u201cthe economy of tomorrow\u201d? The right answer is \u201capproximately nothing except to defend property and contracts, and punish fraud.\u201d\n\nTo the extent that the economy of today is underperforming its potential, it is due to government. The misallocation of capital that caused the financial crisis was caused by government. The fear of entrepreneurs to start or expand business is due to fear of government regulation, not least Obamacare. The millions of Americans who are becoming lazy because of the ease of getting food stamps, unemployment benefits, and \u2014 when unemployment runs out \u2014 pretending to have disabilities to further fleece taxpayers are able to do so because of government.\n\nGovernment prevents the economy of tomorrow. The right answer, then, is for Hillary and her \u201cexpert\u201d friends to sit down, shut up, and get out of the way.\n\nLanguage like \u201cstrengthening families and communities\u201d is usually liberal code for \u201chelping black people.\u201d But the answer, even for a coded question, is the same: government is part of the problem, which means more government isn\u2019t the solution.\n\nAs Kay Hymowitz explains in a must-read article for City Journal entitled \u201cThe Black Family: 40 Years of Lies,\u201d there was growing trouble in the stability and formation of black nuclear families before the implementation of the welfare state under President Johnson\u2019s \u201cGreat Society\u201d program. But the welfare state poured fuel on the fire, paying people to have more children and fewer marriages despite out-of-wedlock childbirth being one of the strongest predictors of that child\u2019s ending up in poverty.\n\nThe brilliant economist Thomas Sowell notes that \u201cthe political left\u2019s welfare state makes poverty more comfortable, while penalizing attempts to rise out of poverty. Unless we believe that some people are predestined to be poor, the left\u2019s agenda is a disservice to them, as well as to society.\u201d\n\nEven the New York Times\u2019 Nicholas Kristof couldn\u2019t deny it: \u201cThis is painful for a liberal to admit, but conservatives have a point when they suggest that America\u2019s safety net can sometimes entangle people in a soul-crushing dependency.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, many young-ish white women \u2014 this century\u2019s female version of what we used to call yuppies \u2014 are becoming \u201csingle mothers by choice\u201d and crowing about it.\n\nIt may go slightly too far to call that child abuse, but data consistently show that children living with two parents have more \u201cbehavior self-control\u201d and are less likely to be \u201cexposed to high levels of aggravated parenting than are children living with a single parent.\u201d Furthermore, \u201cChildren living with two married adults (biological or adoptive parents) have, in general, better health, greater access to health care, and fewer emotional or behavioral problems than children living in other types of families.\u201d They also do better in school and in professional life.\n\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough, \u201cNonmarital births are at higher risk of having adverse birth outcomes such as low birthweight, preterm birth, and infant mortality than are children born to married women.\u201d\n\nAs Michael Barone put it, \u201cit is an uncomfortable truth that children of divorce and children with unmarried parents tend to do much worse in life than children of two-parent families.\u201d\n\nOther than the perhaps-slightly-effective use of the tax code to encourage rather than penalize marriage and children \u2014 something I oppose because it involves the transfer of wealth from one group of Americans (single and childless) to another group (married with children) \u2014 the best thing the government can do here is to forget about \u201cfamily\u201d policy.\n\nInstead, popular politicians (is that an oxymoron?) should use their bully pulpits to encourage marriage and to urge societal leaders such as priests and rabbis and pastors to encourage marriage for anybody who wants to have (or adopt) children.\n\nI say this not as a social conservative or someone whinging about \u201cmoral decay\u201d in the country but as an American watching over 44 percent of our children now being born to single parents and knowing, because the data have been so consistent for so many decades, that these choices are harming future generations and thereby weakening the greatest country in the history of humankind.\n\nAnd of course, the disasters that are public school systems in parts of the United States where the people most desperately need a decent education to break the cycle of poverty represent the most inexcusable malign impact of government on \u201cfamilies and communities.\u201d With Democratic politicians beholden to teachers unions\u2019 money, poor black kids are victims of the very politicians mindlessly supported by the overwhelming majority of black voters \u2014 and those white liberals who so loudly decry their plight while not truly understanding it.\n\nCombining the welfare state, the \u201cmarriage penalty\u201d in the tax code (which most poor people aren\u2019t impacted by anyway) and bad public schools \u2014 just to name a few harmful things foisted on us by politicians \u2014 the government has long been a significant contributing factor to the destruction of families and communities. In short, government can do little to strengthen families and communities. But it can do \u2014 and has done much \u2014 to harm them.\n\nFinally, the truly ironic statement by Hillary Clinton that she \u2014 whose campaign and supporters hope to raise an \u201cobscene\u201d $2.5 billion to fund her presidential ambition \u2014 wants to get money out of politics. As John Podhoretz points out, \u201cTo give you a sense of just how mind-blowing (that amount is), consider the fact that in 2012, Barack Obama and Mitt Romney together spent $2.14 billion.\u201d\n\nIf there were ever a case of government trying to solve a problem of its own causing, this is it.\n\nMoney flows into politics because \u2014 and only because \u2014government does so many things it shouldn\u2019t. It picks winners and losers through regulations and earmarks. It stifles competition to help political allies and passes rules and imposes taxes to punish those who are out of favor at that moment. It is no wonder that lobbying budgets of companies and industry associations have exploded in recent years and that \u201cK Street\u201d is now widely understood to be the home of one of America\u2019s true growth industries.\n\nPoliticians publicly decry the excessive influence of lobbyists, but they\u2019re crying wolf because those revolving doors represent future lucrative employment for themselves and senior staffers. In short, there is precious little incentive for politicians to truly end lobbyists\u2019 ability to influence policy. From the \u201cdemand side,\u201d there will be no way to end lobbying until and unless Congress and executive branch agencies simply stop involving themselves in matters that should be left to free enterprise. I\u2019m not holding my breath for such a revolutionary change.\n\nAs the brilliant George Mason University economist Don Boudreaux (who recently wondered why such a bald-faced liar as Hillary Clinton is taken seriously) once told me, \u201cif you want to get the money out of politics, you have to get politics out of money.\u201d\n\nBut nothing that Hillary Clinton proposes involves lessening the power and intrusiveness of government, and therefore efforts to keep money out of politics will be as fruitful as thinking that throwing a rock into a fast-moving river will cause the water to stop rushing by.\n\nWhile the specifics of any particular Clinton policy may be described by her media cheerleaders as \u201cbold,\u201d the underlying mindset is simply old. It\u2019s all about control by \u201csmart people\u201d and \u201cexperts\u201d of the rest of us dim-witted plebeians. It is the steel fist of tyranny in a velvet glove.\n\nIf Hillary were to be truly bold, she\u2019d try something truly different: trusting that Americans are smart enough and capable enough to manage our own lives, and giving us the freedom to prove it.\n\nShe won\u2019t, of course; words like \u201ctrust\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d would never cross a mind such as hers.\n\nAll that remains to be seen is whether Hillary Clinton\u2019s conceit is fatal to her presidential hopes or to the nation\u2019s aspirations for a thriving future. The 2016 election will surely kill one of them.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 1742097289343962}, "generator": "WordPress 4.4", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbcf5\"", "article_summary": "All that remains to be seen is whether Hillary Clinton\u2019s conceit is fatal to her presidential hopes or to the nation\u2019s aspirations for a thriving future.\nIn short, there is precious little incentive for politicians to truly end lobbyists\u2019 ability to influence policy.\nThe fear of entrepreneurs to start or expand business is due to fear of government regulation, not least Obamacare.\nBut let\u2019s look at the other three \u2014 while noting that \u201cprotecting our country\u201d was last on her short list.\nMoney flows into politics because \u2014 and only because \u2014government does so many things it shouldn\u2019t."}
