Given recent history, she didn\u2019t face particularly good odds of winning a city that almost reflexively elects identified Democrats.\n\nBut Green didn\u2019t just break precedent \u2014 she demolished it. In a four-person race, she won last week\u2019s election with 46 percent of the vote. Fellow independent candidate Rhonda Smythe came in second. It indicated that 15th Ward voters were willing to put aside party affiliation in deciding Florida\u2019s successor.\n\n\"The real takeaway is I don't think anybody should be entitled to a position \u2014 there shouldn't just be a rubber stamp on who receives a nomination,\" Green said. \"Elections matter. And we have to make sure that they're contested and we have a good, informed dialogue to really bring out the candidate that's going to represent whatever constituent base the best.\"\n\nIt should be noted that Green \u2014 who has been active in Democratic politics for years \u2014 would have run in a Democratic primary if she weren\u2019t competing in a special election. But the entire episode may prompt a deeper question: Why are elections for St. Louis offices partisan anyway?\n\nAfter all, the actual job of an alderman \u2014 or, for that matter, the city\u2019s recorder of deeds or license collector \u2014 is not overtly partisan. Most bills filed throughout the board have to do with nuts and bolts constituent services, such as putting a stop sign on a road or redeveloping property.\n\n\u201cA lot of cities have nonpartisan elections at the local level. And I think that would make sense here,\u201d said Alderman Scott Ogilvie, who is the only independent member of the board.\n\n\u201cThe benefit is it makes more people interested in running. Because these jobs are not partisan jobs. At the local level, you don\u2019t deal with the ideological issues that national-level parties deal with. So you tend to exclude people who might just be more focused on service delivery or local policy.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Kansas City has held nonpartisan elections for years \u2014 as do most other cities throughout Missouri. A change to a nonpartisan model would ostensibly open municipal elections to, say, Republicans or members of the Green Party. Right now, St. Louis residents who vote for those parties on a national level cast ballots in largely fruitless municipal primaries, although city Republicans might vote in Democratic primaries for mayor and aldermen anyway.\n\n\u201cMaking an open primary that lets everybody regardless of party affiliation come vote for the same candidates means everybody gets to participate in that electoral process,\u201d Ogilvie said. \u201cRight now, quite frankly, we are excluding some people who would tend to vote in Republican primaries. They\u2019re not really able to participate on whom we choose for aldermen.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve got basically a one-party system \u2014 which is what we have now \u2014 you might as well have a no-party system and put everybody on the same ballot,\u201d he added.\n\nBut as Ogilvie mentioned, making city elections nonpartisan could give candidates who aren\u2019t Democrats a better chance of winning. Richard Berkley, for instance, was a Republican who served as Kansas City\u2019s mayor for 12 years. Closer to home, James Knowles III \u2014 who has long been active in Republican politics \u2014 was elected as Ferguson\u2019s mayor twice.\n\nDuring an interview in April, Knowles threw out the idea of making elections of a merged St. Louis-St. Louis County nonpartisan. He said it was \u201ckind of silly to have\u201d partisan elections \u201cwhere all we should be worried about is economic development and health and human services.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do we have political parties for that? I mean, it\u2019s absurd,\u201d Knowles said. \u201cIf somebody were to look at me and say \u2018I want to meet James Knowles. Wait, he\u2019s a Republican!\u2019 And then instead of meeting James Knowles, we spend the entire time debating the [Affordable Care Act] or Mitch McConnell or some other ridiculous national Republican thing. If we\u2019re talking about streets or safety and municipal issues, then let\u2019s talk about that.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t hold your breath?\n\nGreen herself isn\u2019t in favor of doing away with partisan elections for city offices. And, in fact, both Green and Ogilvie are planning to run next year in Democratic primaries for their respective seats.\n\nDuring an episode of the Politically Speaking podcast, she said the main reason she ran as an independent was because she didn\u2019t have the opportunity to participate in a traditional Democratic primary.\n\n\u201cThat primary allows for most of the discussion that took place in my special election to happen during that primary,\u201d Green said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not sure that we really need to talk about eliminating those parties. But it does make sense to at least have the discussion.\u201d\n\nBoard of Aldermen President Lewis Reed, who backed Green in the primary, also expressed wariness about ditching partisan elections.\n\n\u201cThe party system gives people an opportunity to understand, kind of loosely, what core values that candidate should or is professing to embody,\u201d Reed said. \u201cAnd in this case, Megan is a little bit different. Megan is currently the vice president of the Democratic Ward organization. She\u2019s volunteered on campaigns. She was one of my volunteers. I\u2019ve known her for years. She\u2019s a great friend. And a hard worker. She was on Obama for America\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo she had the Democratic credentials,\u201d Reed said. \u201cShe no choice but to run as a independent because of the way the party system works.\u201d\n\nAlderwoman Beth Murphy, a 13th Ward Democrat who recently won a special election to the Board of Aldermen, echoed Reed\u2019s sentiments. When she sought the Democratic nomination for the seat, she netted the endorsement of 13th Ward Committeeman Michael Dauphin. The city\u2019s Democratic Central Committee ultimately decides on the nominee, but traditionally the committee acquiesces to whomever the ward committeepeople favor. (Murphy was serving as the 13th Ward's Democratic committeewoman at the time and had been active in volunteering throughout the ward for years.)\n\nShe told St. Louis Public Radio the party system allows voters to know \u201cwhere the candidate is going.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do policy \u2014 not necessarily with the stop signs issues or whatever. But we do as far as who\u2019s going to build what. Is it going to be staffed by union people when something is built or not?\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThose are the kind of things that concern me. I believe the Democratic Party is important for the worker.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you call yourself a Democrat or are a Democrat, your cards on the table,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd if you run in a nonpartisan election, we never really know until perhaps it\u2019s too late.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not likely that partisan elections in the city are going away anytime soon. That would almost certainly require wholesale changes to the city\u2019s charter, which would require a citywide vote. And Democratic officials wouldn't sit on the sidelines on an effort that could greatly reduce their influence.\n\nFor Green\u2019s part, she\u2019s hoping her win shakes up the idea that a slated candidate should always win: \u201cMy end all, be all result -\u2014 I want to see good candidates elected.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if that means that we do nonpartisan elections, great. If that means we keep the party system, great. What I want to see is high-quality people that feel like they can go into public service. That they can run for office and that they can win,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to support that whether that\u2019s through the party system or not.\u201d\n\nOn the Trail, a weekly column, weaves together some of the intriguing threads from the world of Missouri politics.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Politics & Issues", "description": "On paper, Megan Ellyia Green should have been the underdog in last week\u2019s 15th Ward election.
