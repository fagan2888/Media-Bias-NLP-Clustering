As of 9 a.m. Sunday, 97 people were still without electricity.\n\nAPS said it will reimburse affected customers who buy up to 40 pounds of ice or 20 pounds of dry ice to help preserve food.\n\nThe utility advised residents waiting for power to come back on to keep their refrigerator and freezer doors closed. Refrigerators will keep food cold for four hours. A full freezer will preserve food for up to 48 hours, it said.\n\nIn Buckeye, APS reported about 3,000 customers without power as of early Saturday evening.\n\nThe rain in the Wickenburg area eventually let up overnight. But for many, the cleanup is just beginning and it could take weeks.\n\nOne of the hardest hit businesses in Wickenburg was the Horseshoe Cafe, where employees used homemade sandbags to keep the water out.\n\n\"We had water in the bathrooms, kitchen, mud, dirt, yuck, sludge, everything,\" said owner Debra Thompson. \"It was just a mess. And everybody just baled in and started working really hard.\"\n\nAnyone needing shelter is being told to come to the Wickenburg Community Center at 160 Valentine St.\n\nCopyright 2015 KPHO/KTVK (KPHO Broadcasting Corporation).
