Mr. Gray was asked on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause they didn\u2019t have him cross-examined\u2026he was able to just go and just tell his story freely - there was no hard-hitting questions, the inconsistencies that I see between the three statements that he made, nobody pointed them out,\u201d Mr. Gray said.\n\nIn a new interview with ABC News, Officer Wilson said Brown charged him and went for his gun, saying that he has a clear conscience and that he would not have done anything differently that day.\n\nThe announcement this week that a grand jury did not find sufficient evidence to charge Officer Wilson, who is white, with a crime for shooting Brown, with is black, reignited racial tensions and sparked protests in the community and across the country.\n\nMr. Gray also blasted the grand jury proceedings and the fact that prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch did not recommend specific charges.\n\n\u201cAnd then there\u2019s no recommendation to charge him with anything - you put in front of a grand jury a list of charges and you don\u2019t suggest which one matches the case you want to bring?\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody knows if you don\u2019t make a recommendation to a grand jury, that\u2019s an indication that you shouldn\u2019t indict, and they took the cue from the prosecutor as the way it was given to \u2018em.\u201d\n\nIn announcing the grand jury decision Monday, Mr. McCulloch said a review of the evidence identified a \u201clack of accurate detail\u201d in some of the early reports about the incident and that the grand jury deserved credit for sticking with evidence after wading through conflicting eyewitness accounts.\n\n\u201cThey are the only people who have heard and examined all of the evidence of all of the witnesses,\u201d Mr. McCulloch said.\n\nBut Mr. Gray also labeled the process a \u201cdata dump.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just \u2018give you every and anything we can think of, even\u2026stuff that\u2019s irrelevant,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t get this data dump technique, putting all this information out there, most of which is irrelevant, and then you say, \u2018you guys decide which one of the four charges you have an option to do, you decide if any of this fits.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite naturally, they\u2019re going to say, \u2018I\u2019m totally confused,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Gray said they\u2019re now looking to an ongoing federal investigation into the matter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The announcement this week that a grand jury did not find sufficient evidence to charge Officer Wilson, who is white, with a crime for shooting Brown, with is black, reignited racial tensions and sparked protests in the community and across the country.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The announcement this week that a grand jury did not find sufficient evidence to charge Officer Wilson, who is white, with a crime for shooting Brown, with is black, reignited racial tensions and sparked protests in the community and across the country.", "title": "Michael Brown family lawyer: Darren Wilson \u2018did what he wanted to do, not what he had to\u2019", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/26/michael-brown-family-lawyer-darren-wilson-did-what/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/21/b3f380d0c82d132d660f6a7067002a87.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/11/21/b3f380d0c82d132d660f6a7067002a87.jpg", "title": "Michael Brown family lawyer: Darren Wilson \u2018did what he wanted t", "description": "The announcement this week that a grand jury did not find sufficient evidence to charge Officer Wilson, who is white, with a crime for shooting Brown, with is black, reignited racial tensions and spar", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Anthony Gray, Michael Brown, Darren Wilson"}, "article_summary": "\u201cHe did what he wanted to do, not what he had to do,\u201d attorney Anthony Gray said of Officer Wilson, saying that the officer changed his version of events.\nA lawyer for the family of Michael Brown on Wednesday said Officer Darren Wilson changed his story on what happened during the shooting of the 18-year-old Brown on Aug. 9 and reiterated criticism of the process surrounding the grand jury proceedings in the case.\nMr. Gray said they\u2019re now looking to an ongoing federal investigation into the matter.\nMr. Gray also blasted the grand jury proceedings and the fact that prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch did not recommend specific charges.\nBut Mr. Gray also labeled the process a \u201cdata dump.\u201d\u201cIt was just \u2018give you every and anything we can think of, even\u2026stuff that\u2019s irrelevant,\u2019\u201d he said."}
