Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference and author of the new book \u201cBe Light,\u201d recently stopped by TheBlaze\u2019s New York City newsroom to discuss Christianity, Donald Trump and the 2016 political season.\n\nRodriguez candidly attributed Trump\u2019s rise to become the presumptive GOP presidential nominee as a mass reaction to the cultural dynamic that has been at play over the past eight years \u2014 one that has been characterized by what he described as a \u201chesitant angst building up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe consequence of the earthquake is Donald Trump,\u201d he said, noting that societal reverberations have resulted from frustration over big government, impediments to religious liberty and political correctness \u201con steroids.\u201d \u201dIt\u2019s an interesting thing, because it\u2019s Christian populism.\u201d\n\nRodriguez continued, further describing the cultural changes that have unfolded, \u201cIn a matter of 7 and a half years, America has been redefined culturally, morally \u2014 in so many ways even economically [with] this thing called Obamacare.\u201d\n\nListen to Rodriguez at the 57:00-minute mark below:\n\nBut Rodriguez didn\u2019t let his fellow Americans \u2014 and Christians, specifically \u2014 off of the hook either when it comes to accountability for the cultural changes that have unfolded.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s us. We are what we tolerate. And even people who have a Judeo-Christian sort of ethos \u2014 we tolerated this, because we were afraid to be called names,\u201d he said \u201cBecause we have a narcissistic, selfie view of Christianity and we have this idea that it\u2019s all about being liked \u2026 \u2018I want people to like me\u2019 \u2026 we cared more about the likes and the people that follow us rather than obeying the one we follow.\u201d\n\nEither way, Rodriguez said that Trump is resonating due to the fact that he appears \u201creal,\u201d and that there\u2019s a sense of both transparency and authenticity to his candidacy when compared to others who are running in the 2016 race.\n\n\u201cHe may be really wrong, but he\u2019s real,\u201d he said of Trump.\n\nRodriguez believes, though, that the Republican \u201cblew it with the Latino community\u201d considering the rhetoric that he has uttered involving immigrants and illegal immigration more broadly.\n\nThe pastor, who has been vocal on immigration issues in recent years, said that Latinos do not support amnesty and aren\u2019t in favor of open borders. Rodriguez added that he wants to see a halt to illegal immigration \u2014 an issue he discussed with TheBlaze extensively back in 2014.\n\nStay tuned for part two of The Church Boys interview with Rodriguez later on this week, and find out more about his new book \u201cBe Light: Shining God\u2019s Beauty, Truth, and Hope into a Darkened World.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow the author of this story on Twitter and Facebook and check out his new book \u201cThe Armageddon Code: One Journalist\u2019s Quest for End-Times Answers\u201d:\n\nFollow @BillyHallowell", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30; polling-uri=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/1.xml; polling-uri2=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/2.xml; polling-uri3=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/3.xml; polling-uri4=http://www.theblaze.com/publish/_livetile/notifications/4.xml", "application-name": "TheBlaze.com", "twitter": {"description": "The Rev.
