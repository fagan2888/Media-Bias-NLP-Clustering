And, as the telecommunications industry becomes increasingly concentrated, this lack of choice has resulted in huge price increases and often poor service for consumers,\u201d wrote Sanders and Warren as well as Sens. Al Franken (D-Minn.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSpecifically, they mentioned the proposed merger of Charter Communications and Time Warner Cable, which they said would \u201conly increase concentration in the cable and broadband markets.\u201d\n\nThe senators asked FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler to provide them with information about the average cost of broadband by state and provider, as well as for urban and rural customers.\n\n\u201cThe Commission\u2019s collection of pricing information is critical to upholding its mission to protect consumers, and promote competition, and deploy broadband across America,\u201d they said.\n\nThe FCC declined to comment on the letter.\n\nThe issue of the FCC\u2019s authority over Internet pricing is contentious. The business community and conservative lawmakers have said they think that the commission\u2019s new net neutrality rules open the door to rate regulation. They say that by regulating broadband providers like utilities, the FCC can now seek approval over how much companies charge consumers for Internet access.\n\nWheeler has insisted that won\u2019t be the case.\n\n\"Broadband providers will be able to adjust retail rates without Commission approval and without having to wait even a minute,\" the FCC said in a fact sheet about the net neutrality order.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "Consolidation in the broadband industry \"has resulted in huge price increases,\" they said.", "description": "Consolidation in the broadband industry \"has resulted in huge price increases,\" they said.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "David McCabe", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "Consolidation in the broadband industry \"has resulted in huge price increases,\" they said.", "title": "Warren, Sanders want FCC to investigate high Internet prices", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/247504-warren-sanders-want-fcc-to-investigate-high-internet-prices", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-10T12:19:37-04:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2015-07-10T12:19-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/247504-warren-sanders-want-fcc-to-investigate-high-internet-prices", "dcterms.date": "2015-07-10T11:44-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "David McCabe", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren,Federal Communications Commission", "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-10T11:44:38-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-10T12:19:37-04:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/technology/247504-warren-sanders-want-fcc-to-investigate-high-internet-prices", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "Consolidation in the broadband industry \"has resulted in huge price increases,\" they said.", "card": "summary", "title": "Warren, Sanders want FCC to investigate high Internet prices"}, "dcterms.title": "Warren, Sanders want FCC to investigate high Internet prices"}, "article_summary": "\"Many Americans have very few, if any, options when it comes to choosing their local cable and Internet providers.\nare asking the Federal Communications Commission to look into pricing for Internet service around the country.\nThe issue of the FCC\u2019s authority over Internet pricing is contentious.\nThey say that by regulating broadband providers like utilities, the FCC can now seek approval over how much companies charge consumers for Internet access.\n\"Broadband providers will be able to adjust retail rates without Commission approval and without having to wait even a minute,\" the FCC said in a fact sheet about the net neutrality order."}
