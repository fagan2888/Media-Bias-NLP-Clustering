Employees may take leave at any point up to a year after the birth of their child, Lori Matloff Goler, the company's head of human resources, said in a Facebook post late Wednesday.\n\nFacebook currently offers four months of paid parental leave to U.S.-based full-time workers. Outside the United States, Facebook now offers a minimum of four months of paid leave to full-time employees who are new mothers and primary caregivers. Fathers and non-primary caregivers outside the United States get four weeks of paid leave.\n\n\"We want to be there for our people at all stages of life, and in particular we strive to be a leading place to work for families,\" she added. \"An important part of this is offering paid parental or 'baby' leave.\"\n\nGoler said the new policy will primarily help new fathers and employees in same-sex relationships outside the United States, noting that it will not change maternity leave already available to employees worldwide.\n\nZuckerberg last week said he would take two months off after his daughter's birth. Zuckerberg announced in July that he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, were expecting a baby girl; they have not said when the baby is due.\n\nHis announcement was seen in Silicon Valley as a strong endorsement from a high-technology industry top executive on the importance of family time.\n\nTechnology companies in Silicon Valley have been rushing to extend parental leave allowances and other benefits to help recruit and retain employees.\n\nMany high-tech workers, however, do not take advantage of such benefits for fear of falling behind at work or missing out on promotions.
