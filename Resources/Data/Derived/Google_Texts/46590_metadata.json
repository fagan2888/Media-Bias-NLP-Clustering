A second requires abortion facilities to match the standards of an outpatient surgical center.\n\nBoth sides have been gathering vivid personal accounts from women to supplement the legal arguments, believing the effort could appeal particularly to swing-vote Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\nThe case will be argued March 2.\n\nObamacare, unions\n\nThe Court will also decide its fourth case on U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThis one is a challenge brought by Christian colleges and religious non-profits who contend the law\u2019s requirement that their health plans provide birth control violates their religious beliefs.\n\nThe justices combined seven similar cases from groups that include the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Roman Catholic nuns that runs nursing homes.\n\nOn January 11, the Court will hear oral arguments on whether public employees can be required to join a union or pay it a fee for collective-bargaining services.\n\nThe California case challenges pro-union laws in more than 20 states that require all public employees pay a \u201cfair share fee\u201d to their union, even if they are opposed to the union and refuse to join.\n\nIf the lawsuit is upheld, public-employee unions say they could be dealt crippling blows in about half the overwhelmingly Democratic states that allow such agency clauses.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "USA, US, Supreme Court, abortion, Obamacare", "Author": "VOA News", "og": {"site_name": "VOA", "description": "Justices to hear first abortion case in nearly a decade - deciding whether Texas can enforce two regulations that would force about 75 percent of the state\u2019s abortion clinics to shut down", "title": "Key Supreme Court Cases in 2016 Include Abortion, Obamacare", "url": "http://www.voanews.com/content/key-supreme-court-cases-in-2016-include-abortion-obamacare/3130833.html", "image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/03074E70-D1A9-4CBE-9FF5-F86087246E85_cx12_cy1_cw88_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://gdb.voanews.com/03074E70-D1A9-4CBE-9FF5-F86087246E85_cx12_cy1_cw88_mw1024_mh1024_s.jpg", "site": "@voanews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Key Supreme Court Cases in 2016 Include Abortion, Obamacare", "google-site-verification": "xhlpWO2mj7cS-CLSz4sliKEzNLqoRguHlaJnb1PFuBs", "keywords": "voa, voice of america, voanews, voanews,voianews, english news, voa special english, special english, voa\u5b98\u7f51, voanews.com, china, iran the voice of america, syria, \u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0441 \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0438, \u7f8e\u56fd\u4e4b\u97f3", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/voiceofamerica"}, "abstract": "The Voice of America is one of the world's most trusted sources for news and information from the United States and around the world.
