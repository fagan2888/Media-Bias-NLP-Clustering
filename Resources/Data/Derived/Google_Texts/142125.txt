In 2010, the time was never better for Beau Biden, Delaware’s attorney general, to make a run for the US Senate.

He was doing well as attorney general and his father Joe Biden left Capitol Hill in 2008 to join President Obama in the White House.

Biden, then 40, said he has a duty to fulfill as attorney general, and the most immediate need is to focus on a case of great consequences. And therefore he said he will not run for the United States Senate, he said.

It was quite easy to read it as politics as in 2010, the Democrats were trying hard to regain their footing after the hard fight to pass the Affordable Care Act.

Biden got stuck to prosecute Earl Bradley, a pediatrician who perpetrated one of the worst cases of child sexual abuse by sexually assaulting dozens, if not hundreds, of his young patients.

The number that came before Biden was staggering. More than 1,400 patients filed claims against Bradley, who was convicted in 2011 of raping or abusing 86 patients over 11 years.

The average age of the victims was found to be just three years old, and one alleged victim was just three months old.

It was found that Bradley designed his office with a Disney theme, and abuse occurred in a ‘Pinocchio room’ and a ‘Little Mermaid’ room.

Investigators even found video tape recordings made by Bradley. The footage recording ran for 13 hours.

Investigating officer in court documented the video as one of the most violent and brutal attacks on a child of any age that he had ever seen.

Bradley was sentenced to 14 life sentences without parole for 14 counts of first-degree rape plus more than 160 years for multiple counts of assault and sexual exploitation of a child.

Biden in an opinion wrote that as adults we all have a legal and moral obligation to stand up and speak out for children who are being abused as they cannot speak for themselves.
