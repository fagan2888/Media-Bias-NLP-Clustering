The conservative budget hawks have launched their announced anti-Trump campaign today with two 30-second TV spots aimed at demolishing the perception of Trump as a conservative, anti-Establishment populist. The first compares Trump to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders \u2014 unfavorably:\n\nNot only has Trump been all over the map on key economic issues \u2013 but he has taken several positions that are downright horrendous! Trump came out for socialized medicine that was to the left of Obamacare, and he still thinks it works. Trump proposed the largest tax increase in U.S. history. That\u2019s not easy to do, but Trump did. Trump not only supported eminent domain to take people\u2019s private property so developers could use it for casinos and amusement parks, he\u2019s tried to do it himself! Trump jumped on board with Obama\u2019s tax-the-rich mantra, dismissing a flat tax because he wants rates that \u201cgraduate upward.\u201d Note to Donald: that\u2019s the system we have in place. Trump doesn\u2019t just saber-rattle about trade wars, he wants to take up the sword and rush the U.S. into massive trade wars with huge tariffs that would be a devastating tax on American businesses and consumers.\n\nClub for Growth Action takes more specific aim at a particular b\u00eate noire for conservatives \u2014 the Kelo decision. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling approved the seizure of private property through eminent domain to transfer to a private party rather than to public property for improvement, a decision that created so much anger on the Right that an attempt was made to get Justice David Souter\u2019s home town to seize his house in a similar manner. Not surprisingly, Trump loves eminent domain seizures for private urban renewal projects:\n\nThe ads are well conceived and constructed, but \u2026 will they have any impact? Club for Growth Action plans to spend $1 million on this buy in Iowa, so they\u2019re putting some investment behind it. It won\u2019t be possible for Trump defenders to accuse Club for Growth of supporting Jeb Bush or the GOP establishment, but they may not even bother refuting these attacks. Intellectually they score points, but people have been scoring intellectual points on Trump for months. How\u2019s that working out?\n\nAt this stage, both Trump and Bernie Sanders have built large followings on emotional connections to frustrations among all voters with seemingly unresponsive leadership in both major parties. Deconstructing policy statements and history probably won\u2019t have a significant impact at this stage, but it may set up more detailed rebuttals later in the fall, when voters begin to invest more carefully in their primary choices.\n\nAll the same, it would be interesting to see Trump confronted on Kelo in tomorrow\u2019s debate. Government seizure of private property for the enrichment of wealthy developers is hardly a populist position, and it could make for a revealing moment from the man who continually brags about his wealth.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "\u201cHe\u2019s really just playing us for chumps.\u201d", "title": "Video: Club for Growth ad slams Trump as \u201cjust another politician\u201d", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/09/15/video-club-for-growth-ad-slams-trump-as-just-another-politician/", "image": {"secure_url": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/_OEijvTi0NE/0.jpg", "identifier": "http://img.youtube.com/vi/_OEijvTi0NE/0.jpg"}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@EdMorrissey"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-15T18:01:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-09-15T18:55:46+00:00"}, "keywords": "club for growth, Donald Trump, Kelo, single payer,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3139\"", "article_summary": "Club for Growth Action plans to spend $1 million on this buy in Iowa, so they\u2019re putting some investment behind it.\nClub for Growth Action takes more specific aim at a particular b\u00eate noire for conservatives \u2014 the Kelo decision.\nNot surprisingly, Trump loves eminent domain seizures for private urban renewal projects:The ads are well conceived and constructed, but \u2026 will they have any impact?\nTrump not only supported eminent domain to take people\u2019s private property so developers could use it for casinos and amusement parks, he\u2019s tried to do it himself!\nIt won\u2019t be possible for Trump defenders to accuse Club for Growth of supporting Jeb Bush or the GOP establishment, but they may not even bother refuting these attacks."}
