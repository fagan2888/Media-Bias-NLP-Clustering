Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), the assumed successor, said he would not run for the job. The shake-up may soon be resolved as an election is scheduled for next week and Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) said Tuesday he would run for the position given that certain conditions are met, but the underlying divisions in the party are not going away.\n\nThose divisions and the leadership crisis in Congress are a direct result of demands made by the House Freedom Caucus, a group of ultra-conservatives that, after pressure from Cruz, dethroned Boehner, destroyed McCarthy\u2019s candidacy, and may fight Ryan\u2019s election. Cruz meets monthly with the 40 or so hardliners in the 10-month-old caucus and has encouraged them to drive his agenda in the lower chamber.\n\nBut hundreds of miles away from the mess and from the growing frustrations over the Texas senator\u2019s inability to compromise or stand down from a government shutdown, Cruz highlighted his record of \u201cstanding up to Washington\u201d and obstructing government to voters in Iowa. \u201cOn that, my record is markedly different from every other candidate,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz does stand out among the Republican candidates \u2014 he is the only one who fought tirelessly for the 2013 government shutdown, which hurt the economy and cost the federal government billions of dollars. He also was the strongest opponent of Obama\u2019s executive action to protect roughly 5 million immigrants from deportation, and he is leading the fight in the Senate against Planned Parenthood, one of the largest providers of women\u2019s health care in the country.\n\nWhile he has been a central figure involved in the leadership fight in Washington, he maintained on the campaign trail that he was not getting involved in choosing the new House leader. In response to a question about whether Ryan would make a good speaker, Cruz told ThinkProgress that he\u2019s \u201cconsistently stayed out of that question\u201d and trusts the House Republican conference to select someone who is \u201cdeeply committed to honoring the promises to the men and women who elected us.\u201d\n\nThen on Meet the Press on Sunday, Cruz refused to defend Ryan\u2019s conservatism, highlighting his unofficial but influential role in the House Freedom Caucus. \u201cSpeaker Cruz,\u201d as Hill Democrats have called him for his influence on the lower chamber, is tying his campaign to the shake-up and the general unhappiness of the party base, reflected in the turmoil over choosing a new speaker.\n\nCruz is attempting to appeal to conservatives who are displeased with government and the Republican Party establishment. Voters in Iowa told ThinkProgress they admire Cruz\u2019s willingness to fight back against the Washington elite.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fought a lot against Congress when they were wrong,\u201d Keokuk resident Joyce Schevers told ThinkProgress. \u201cHe had the guts to get up and fight.\u201d\n\nSchevers said she\u2019s \u201cvery disgusted\u201d with most Congressional Republicans who have lost their conservative values and voted with Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m glad that Boehner stepped down because he voted with Obama a lot and he didn\u2019t even fight,\u201d Shevers, who identifies as a member of the Tea Party, continued. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so frustrating. The Republicans won by promising this and that, and they didn\u2019t fight.\u201d\n\nFort Madison, Iowa resident Tom Schulz, who said that he has \u201cnothing in common with the establishment Republican Party,\u201d called Cruz \u201cpotentially the next Ronald Reagan.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Republican establishment absolutely despised Ronald Reagan,\u201d he told ThinkProgress. \u201cVery much the same dynamic you see today. I think it\u2019s a repeat, although I think Cruz is maybe a little deeper than Reagan in his understanding of how the Washington machine works.\u201d\n\nSen. Ted Cruz speaks with voters at a campaign stop in Keokuk, Iowa. CREDIT: Kira Lerner\n\nThe latest Monmouth University poll puts Ted Cruz in third place with ten percent of Republicans saying they\u2019d support him for the GOP nomination, leading all of the 11 other \u201cestablishment\u201d candidates who together hold just 25 percent support. The only candidates currently leading Cruz \u2014 Donald Trump and Ben Carson \u2014 have never held political office.\n\nThat same poll showed that Tea Party supporters, many of whom make up Cruz\u2019s base, have a much more negative view of the party than other Republicans. Fifty-nine percent of Tea Party supporters say the party is doing a bad job.\n\nThe Republican Party\u2019s dissatisfaction with Washington is a direct reflection of Congress\u2019 inability to follow through on its commitments, Cruz said. While other members of Congress will campaign on the promise they will do something \u2014 like defund Planned Parenthood or repeal Obamacare \u2014 they quickly give up their demands to compromise with the party establishment and with Democrats in Congress.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Cruz is tirelessly repeating the point that he stands up for what he believes in and follows through on promises. In Kalona, Iowa, he said that Trump\u2019s candidacy has been \u201cimmensely beneficial for our campaign\u201d because he has \u201chelped frame the central question of this primary as: who will stand up to Washington?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell if that\u2019s the central question, the natural next question is who actually has stood up to Washington?\u201d he said, to cheers from the crowd. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a better question for the Republican Party to be decided on than that one.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s ability to tout his record of standing up to Washington has helped him on the campaign trail and has put him in a good position to await Trump and Carson\u2019s fade. \u201cAt the same time the Trump shine is starting to fade, Cruz could be positioned to become the candidate vehicle that the most conservative voters rally behind,\u201d GOP pundit Kevin Madden told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe budget drama and the threat of another government shutdown in December will again put the spotlight on Cruz, who is more than willing to shutter the government to get what he wants \u2014 and to prove to the American people that he\u2019s the candidate who will \u201cstand up to Washington.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "He's campaigning on his record of standing up to Washington.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "He's campaigning on his record of standing up to Washington.", "title": "Ted Cruz Is Tying His Campaign To The Speaker Shake-Up And Conservative Voters Are Loving It", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/10/22/3714663/ted-cruz-house-leadership/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/21135107/AP_927342983510-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "He's campaigning on his record of standing up to Washington.", "creator": "@Kira_Lerner", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/21135107/AP_927342983510-321x214.jpg", "title": "Ted Cruz Is Tying His Campaign To The Speaker Shake-Up And Conservative Voters Are Loving It", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/21135107/AP_927342983510-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/21135107/AP_927342983510-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2015-10-22T08:00:43+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/KiraLerner"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "Cruz is attempting to appeal to conservatives who are displeased with government and the Republican Party establishment.\nVoters in Iowa told ThinkProgress they admire Cruz\u2019s willingness to fight back against the Washington elite.\nPolitics Ted Cruz Is Tying His Campaign To The Speaker Shake-Up And Conservative Voters Are Loving It CREDIT: AP Photo/Brandon Wade Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz speaks to attendees during a North Texas Presidential Forum hosted by Faith & Freedom Coalition and Prestonwood Baptist Church, Sunday, Oct. 18, 2015, in Plano, Texas.\nOn the campaign trail, Cruz is tirelessly repeating the point that he stands up for what he believes in and follows through on promises.\nThe Republican Party\u2019s dissatisfaction with Washington is a direct reflection of Congress\u2019 inability to follow through on its commitments, Cruz said."}
