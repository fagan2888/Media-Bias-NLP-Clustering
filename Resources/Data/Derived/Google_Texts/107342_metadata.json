He played like it was, too.\n\nLooking for a fitting finish to a sensational season, Spieth poured in putts from all over East Lake and never gave Henrik Stenson or anyone else much of a chance Sunday. His final stroke was an 8-foot par putt that was right in the heart for a 1-under 69, and he leaned back with a smile of pure satisfaction.\n\nThe 22-year-old Texan became golf\u2019s first $22 million man \u2014 a PGA Tour record with just over $12 million in prize money, and the $10 million bonus for the FedEx Cup.\n\n\u201cThis is incredible,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cThis is an event where we approach it like a major championship because we know this is possible at the end of it.\u201d\n\nEven when he missed back-to-back cuts to start the FedEx Cup playoffs, Spieth spent the month trying to peak for the most important event in the lucrative series. He was the first to show up at East Lake on Monday to start grinding on his game. And with a one-shot lead going into the final round Sunday, he was on the putting green three hours before his tee time for what caddie Michael Greller called the \u201cearly grind.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe only do this at the majors,\u201d Greller said.\n\nIt all paid off so handsomely, especially that putter.\n\nSpieth made three birdies in a four-hole stretch around the turn, and they were demoralizing for Stenson. Spieth made a 20-foot birdie on No. 8 for a two-shot swing that he never gave back. He made an 18-foot birdie on the par-5 ninth with Stenson already at tap-in range for birdie. And with Stenson just over 3 feet away for birdie on No. 11, Spieth curled in a 45-foot birdie putt.\n\n\u201cEleven was a dagger,\u201d Spieth said.\n\nAt that point, Stenson could only smile and bump fists with Spieth.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t expect him to make it,\u201d Stenson said after a 72. \u201cYou\u2019re feeling like you got a good chance to make up some ground. But he just poured that one in the middle. It\u2019s fun to watch and just say, \u2018Well done.\u2019 The best player this week won the tournament, won the FedEx Cup.\u201d\n\nSpieth closed with seven pars for a four-shot victory over Stenson, Danny Lee (65) and Justin Rose (66). His fifth victory of the year, which includes the Masters and the U.S. Open, was worth $1,485,000 million and gave Spieth $12,030,465 for the year.\n\nThe previous record was $10.9 million by Vijay Singh in 2004.\n\nAnd if that wasn\u2019t enough, Spieth went back to No. 1 in the world.\n\nThe first person to greet him was his little sister, Ellie, who keeps Spieth and the entire family so grounded in light of so much success. His parents, girlfriend, grandfather and a tight group of high school friends from Dallas were there to watch another amazing performance in a year filled with him.\n\nSpieth became the youngest player since Horton Smith in 1929 to win five times in a season, and the youngest to claim the FedEx Cup title.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a phenomenal year for him,\u201d Stenson said. \u201cI watched it firsthand at the first two rounds at Augusta, and he played phenomenal and putted phenomenal. And it was the same putting display, really, today \u2014 just an exhibition on the greens, to be honest.\n\n\u201cHis putting and mental focus is the best in the world. It\u2019s hard to argue that.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s no longer an argument for PGA Tour player of the year.\n\nJason Day had five victories, including his first major at the PGA Championship, and there was talk a sixth win and the FedEx Cup might put the Australian in the discussion. Not anymore. Spieth made a spirited bid for the Grand Slam and joined Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods as the only players to finish no worse than fourth in all the professional majors. Along with the money title, he won the Vardon Trophy for the lowest adjusted scoring average.\n\nThe only question he couldn\u2019t answer was what he will do for an encore.\n\n\u201cThis is one I cannot wait to celebrate,\u201d he said.\n\nStenson made a $1 million putt of his own, though it was the least he could do. He was three shots behind when he shanked his shot from the 17th fairway and made double bogey. That dropped him into a four-way tie for fourth and cost him a spot in the FedEx Cup ranking. But he bounced back with a 60-foot birdie putt on the 18th to go back to No. 2 in the FedEx Cup to earn a $3 million bonus (instead of $2 million for third).\n\nStenson had three runner-up finishes in the postseason, and he has five for the year without winning. He still has events left on the European Tour.\n\nBut this week \u2014 and year \u2014 was all about Spieth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the greatest season I\u2019ve ever had, obviously,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cBut it\u2019s one where I believe we took our game on course and off course to a level that I didn\u2019t think would be possible at different times in my life.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jordan Spieth wins Tour Championship to cap off big season", "title": "Jordan Spieth wins Tour Championship to cap off big season", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/27/jordan-spieth-wins-tour-championship-to-cap-off-big-season/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150927__spiethp1-1.jpg", "height": 418}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150927__spiethp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-27T18:39:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T00:23:48+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd23b6\"", "article_summary": "That dropped him into a four-way tie for fourth and cost him a spot in the FedEx Cup ranking.\n2 in the FedEx Cup to earn a $3 million bonus (instead of $2 million for third).\nATLANTA \u2014 Jordan Spieth treated the Tour Championship as if it were a major.\nJason Day had five victories, including his first major at the PGA Championship, and there was talk a sixth win and the FedEx Cup might put the Australian in the discussion.\nSpieth became the youngest player since Horton Smith in 1929 to win five times in a season, and the youngest to claim the FedEx Cup title."}
