His administration\u2019s rule making has been particularly onerous. A friend of mine called this scenario \u201ctyranny by rule\u201d and that seems to be an apt description considering some of the latest rules by his administration are chipping away at our liberty.\n\nWe\u2019ve already covered President Obama\u2019s bathroom edict for schools receiving Title IX monies at Caffeinated Thoughts. Here in Iowa, gender identity was added to Iowa\u2019s Civil Rights Act by Governor Chet Culver and a Democrat-led Legislature. Schools have already been providing reasonable accommodation for students who identify as transgender. In most schools this meant private facilities were offered. Under the Obama edict schools are now required to allow students to choose what restroom, locker room and sex-segregated activity they want and to offer a private facility is considered discriminatory.\n\nAs I\u2019ve written earlier this is clearly unconstitutional as there is no such protections for transgendered students in the Constitution or the Civil Rights Act. The President can\u2019t go beyond the law, but this president has time and time and time again.\n\nAnother rule that was overshadowed by the outrage over the bathroom edict is almost as bad. Again using the power of the pursestrings President Obama attempts to bend others to his will.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced a new rule last Friday in relation to Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, that requires all hospitals to perform abortions and sex change operations or face losing their federal funding, which includes Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nAgain there are no such protections, and this rule did not make any religious exemptions. Considering any religious institution has had to take this administration to court in order to get any kind of accommodation it is unlikely that the administration will give any type of latitude.\n\nSo the long and short of it is this \u2013 the administration is ordering even faith-based institutions to provide abortions and sex change operations or face the loss of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nThe loss of federal money doesn\u2019t just hurt those institutions, but it hurts patients as well and reduces the health care providers that are offered. Something to consider is that 62 percent of all hospitals are non-profits and many of those have faith affiliations. The loss of an ability to receive Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements could force many institutions to close.\n\nThis is putting lives at risk for the sake of his radical political agenda.\n\nOn Wednesday the U.S. Labor Department had to get into the act. They raised the threshold in the Fair Labor Standards Act for salaried worker exemptions to $47,500 a year. So any salaried employee making less than this now qualifies for time-and-a-half overtime pay if they clock more than 40 hours a week. This is regardless of what their job responsibilities are.\n\nWhat this essentially does it turns lower-earning salaried employees into hourly workers. This will take flexibility away from these employees as many had control over when and where they worked.\n\nWorker lose control over their schedules, and this likely won\u2019t even result in pay increases as employers typically offset the overtime with lower base pay or lower hours.\n\nThis is a one-size-fits-all approach that is simply nonsense. The National Retail Federation called this rule change a \u201ccareer killer.\u201d\n\nSo President Obama wants to allow boys in girls\u2019 bathrooms and locker rooms at school, force hospitals to provide abortions, and intervene in lower-earning employee schedules. Doing all of this by rule, and not through Congress of course.", "article_metadata": {"shareaholic": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "language": "en-US", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2016/05/obama-tyranny-by-rule/", "article_author_name": "Shane Vander Hart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/barack-obama-1024x683.jpg", "site_id": "965f58835b5900850067f65116487024", "article_published_time": "2016-05-20T06:00:30+00:00", "shareable_page": "true", "article_modified_time": "2016-05-26T05:30:14+00:00", "keywords": "administrative rulemaking, affordable care act, barack obama, congress, executive orders, fair labor standards act, overtime rule, title ix, transgendered students, u.s. department of education, u.s. department of health and human services, u.s. department of justice, u.s. department of labor, obama, u.s. politics", "wp_version": "7.7.1.0"}, "description": "President Barack Obama will allow boys in girls' locker rooms at school, force hospitals to provide abortions, and change who gets overtime by rule, not law", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Caffeinated Thoughts", "description": "President Barack Obama will allow boys in girls' locker rooms at school, force hospitals to provide abortions, and change who gets overtime by rule, not law", "title": "Obama's Tyranny By Rule | Caffeinated Thoughts", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/barack-obama-1024x683.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-05-19T23:01:20-05:00", "url": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2016/05/obama-tyranny-by-rule/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Barack Obama will allow boys in girls' locker rooms at school, force hospitals to provide abortions, and change who gets overtime by rule, not law", "creator": "@shanevanderhart", "image": "https://caffeinatedthoughts.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/barack-obama.jpg", "title": "Obama's Tyranny By Rule | Caffeinated Thoughts", "site": "@CaffThoughts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 259594777484510}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/CaffThoughts", "published_time": "2016-05-20T01:00:30-05:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/shanevanderhart", "section": "U.S. Politics", "modified_time": "2016-05-19T23:01:20-05:00", "tag": "U.S. Department of Labor"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "We\u2019ve already covered President Obama\u2019s bathroom edict for schools receiving Title IX monies at Caffeinated Thoughts.\nA friend of mine called this scenario \u201ctyranny by rule\u201d and that seems to be an apt description considering some of the latest rules by his administration are chipping away at our liberty.\nHis mentality has been what he can\u2019t accomplish through Congress he\u2019ll do by executive order or by rule.\nAgain using the power of the pursestrings President Obama attempts to bend others to his will.\nThe National Retail Federation called this rule change a \u201ccareer killer.\u201dSo President Obama wants to allow boys in girls\u2019 bathrooms and locker rooms at school, force hospitals to provide abortions, and intervene in lower-earning employee schedules."}
