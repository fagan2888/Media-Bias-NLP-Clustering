CEI, which is heavily Koch-backed, brags that it is \u201ccoordinating and funding both the King v. Burwell case and the DC Circuit Halbig v. Burwell case.\u201d It was CEI that reached out to Michael Carvin, the lawyer who filed the King and Halbig cases and who will be arguing King before the Court. Carvin also argued NFIB in 2012.\n\nShoring up another flank of the assault on the Affordable Care Act is the Koch Army\u2019s Cato Division. The Cato Institute, for its part, has lent much of the substantive heft to the anti-ACA effort. Michael Cannon, Cato\u2019s director of Health Policy Studies, previously worked at other Koch groups, including Citizens for a Sound Economy/Citizens for a Sound Economy Foundation (where he battled FDA regulation of tobacco, among other things). In an interesting twist, Cannon spoke out publicly during the 2012 brouhaha about the Kochs\u2019 taking over Cato. While that might seem to work against his Koch bona fides, Cannon nevertheless said in an NPR interview at the time, \u201cThis is a very difficult issue and it\u2019s a very difficult thing for folks at Cato, because we wouldn\u2019t have our jobs without Charles and David Koch. They are billionaires who have funded the libertarian movement. Not just the Cato Institute, but other groups that have\u2014where I\u2019ve worked and others at Cato have worked. We owe a lot to them.\u201d\n\nCannon and Jonathan H. Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve Law, are the lawyers who have most aggressively pushed the dubious legal theory behind King. Adler reached out to Cannon in 2011, and the pair published a paper in July 2012, saying that the IRS had acted illegally and that the ACA\u2019s tax credits and subsides should not be available to those purchasing insurance on the federal exchange. Cannon has been flogging this theory relentlessly\u2014in the media, in Cato products, on Twitter, in his Forbes column, anywhere he can find the column inches or bandwidth. He participated in a debate last month at Georgetown Law, and in an online forum as well. In December, Cannon and Adler filed their SCOTUS amicus brief for King. Ad Policy\n\nAdler\u2019s Koch connections are what you might expect (although, like Cannon, he criticized the Kochs regarding their Cato donnybrook in 2012). He worked at CEI between 1991 and 2000, and he\u2019s also linked to Koch money through his seats on the NFIB Legal Foundation Board, the Cato Supreme Court Review Board, the Board of Directors of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment, as well as through his role as a senior fellow at the Property & Environment Research Center.\n\nThus, much of the financial and legal muscle behind King v. Burwell directly traces back to Koch Industries. Moreover, aside from the major players in the King case discussed above, a quick glance at the case\u2019s filings finds more Koch-linked amici:\n\nAll told, Koch influence informs about half of the twenty-one briefs filed on the anti-ACA side, and little more than half if you don\u2019t count the briefs from states and elected officials. The petitioner might be \u201cKing\u201d in body, but it\u2019s Koch in heart, mind, spirit\u2014and bank account.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sebelius_ap_img_1-275x173.jpg", "sailthru.author": "Katrina vanden Heuvel", "description": "The Supreme Court will once again look at the fate of the Affordable Care Act\u2014and one family influences the purse strings.", "generator": "WooCommerce 2.3.13", "og": {"site_name": "The Nation", "description": "The Supreme Court will once again look at the fate of the Affordable Care Act\u2014and one family influences the purse strings.", "title": "The Koch Cash Behind the Latest Attack on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/koch-cash-behind-latest-attack-obamacare/", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sebelius_ap_img_1.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 849}, "updated_time": "2015-06-30T16:12:40+00:00", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Supreme Court will once again look at the fate of the Affordable Care Act\u2014and one family influences the purse strings.", "title": "The Koch Cash Behind the Latest Attack on Obamacare", "url": "http://www.thenation.com/article/koch-cash-behind-latest-attack-obamacare/", "image": {"height": 849, "src": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sebelius_ap_img_1.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sebelius_ap_img_1-1440x756.jpg", "width": 1500}, "site": "@TheNation", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "March 2nd, 2015", "sailthru.title": "The Koch Cash Behind the Latest Attack on Obamacare", "keywords": "koch brothers, affordable care act, supreme court, medicaid, king v. burwell, katrina vanden heuvel, the nation", "fb": {"app_id": 192399944158735}, "sailthru.content_id": 117543, "sailthru.tags": "Government,Politics,Blog", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheNationMagazine", "tag": "the nation", "published_time": "2015-03-02T16:06:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-30T16:12:40+00:00", "author": "http://www.thenation.com/author/hweaver/"}, "sailthru.description": "The Supreme Court will once again examine the Affordable Care Act\u2014and the Kochs\u2019 deep-seated connections might influence the gavel.", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/sebelius_ap_img_1-680x430.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Thus, much of the financial and legal muscle behind King v.
