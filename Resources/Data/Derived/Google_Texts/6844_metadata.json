And now the industry lobbying group America's Health Insurance Plans \u2014 which happens to be helmed by Marilyn Tavenner, who previously oversaw the implementation of Obamacare as head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \u2014 is aggressively fighting for more money.\n\nIn a statement issued Thursday, the same day that the nation's largest insurer, UnitedHealth announced it may exit Obamacare due to mounting losses, Tavenner said, \"We've been very clear with the administration about the serious challenges facing consumers and health plans in this Exchange market. Most recently, nearly 800,000 Americans have faced coverage disruptions as a result of the significant and unexpected shortfall with the risk corridors program. When health plans cannot rely on the government to meet its obligations, individuals and families are harmed as a result. The administration must act to ensure this program works as intended and consumers are protected.\"\n\nIn an effort to reassure the industry, CMS, the HHS agency Tavenner previously led, issued guidance reiterating that HHS would use money collected from insurers in 2015 and possibly 2016 to make up the $2.5 billion shortfall that exists in 2014.\n\nBut what happens if there still isn't enough money, and after 2016, the program is taking in less than the money sought by insurers?\n\nHHS said it, would \"explore other sources of funding for risk corridors payments, subject to the availability of appropriations. This includes working with Congress on the necessary funding for outstanding risk corridors payments.\"\n\nThe agency further added: \"HHS recognizes that the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary to make full payments to issuers, and HHS is recording those amounts that remain unpaid following our 12.6 percent payment this winter as fiscal year 2015 obligation of the United States government for which full payment is required.\"\n\nIn reality, this doesn't mean much at all. Risk corridor payments for 2016 won't be due until mid-2017, and by that point, it will be an issue for a future Congress and future president. Nothing that a previous administration's HHS said in 2015 will really matter.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Department of Health and Human Services attempted to reassure private insurers on Thursday that they'll be able to recover losses from participating in Obamacare by claiming it was an obligation of the U.S. government to bail them out.\nAt issue is a provision within the law known as the risk corridors program.
