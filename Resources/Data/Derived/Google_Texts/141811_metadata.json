It grows tax free and money is withdrawn tax free when its time for school. Obama wants to end tax-free withdrawals from these accounts, beginning with new contributions, supposedly to eliminate a tax break for the wealth. His intentions were announced in the State of the Union Fact Sheet, a little-known document released on January 17, three days before his speech to Congress.\n\nObservers from the Left and Right immediately cried foul-charging that Obama's plan would penalize those that should be helped-and were already trying to help themselves.\n\nAccording to the Washington, D.C.-based College Savings Foundation, almost 10% of accounts are held by families with an income below $50,000 per year. Over 70% are owned by families with incomes below $150,000.\n\nA survey produced by SavingForCollege.com finds that 59% of those who open a 529 account did it mainly to get federal tax benefits.\n\n\"The President claims that 529 savings plans only help the wealthy, but we couldn't disagree more,\" said Kathryn Flynn, content director at SavingForCollege.com. \"Many hard working families are currently taking advantage of these benefits to help ensure a solid future for their children. In fact, we found that 73% of SavingforCollege.com visitors that were planning to open a 529 account in the next 12 months had household incomes of less than $150,000.\"", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "A plan that is supposed to end tax shelters for high earners could discourage saving for college across the board.", "author": "John Sandman", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "A plan that is supposed to end tax shelters for high earners could discourage saving for college across the board.", "title": "Obama's Blues for the Middle Class: Let's Tax Withdrawals From 529 College Savings Accounts", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/obamas-blues-for-the-middle-class-lets-tax-withdrawals-from-529-college-savings-accounts", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/highered-mslarge.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/highered-mslarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Financial Planning", "keywords": "529 College Savings Plans, Cost of College State of the Union Address, Tax Shelters", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Financial Planning", "tag": "Tax Shelters", "published_time": "2015-01-26T09:08Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1610918"}, "date": "2015-01-26T09:08Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13021980, "twitter": {"description": "A plan that is supposed to end tax shelters for high earners could discourage saving for college across the board.", "title": "Obama's Blues for the Middle Class: Let's Tax Withdrawals From 529 College Savings Accounts", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/obamas-blues-for-the-middle-class-lets-tax-withdrawals-from-529-college-savings-accounts", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/highered-mslarge.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/highered-mslarge.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "529 College Savings Plans, Cost of College State of the Union Address, Tax Shelters"}, "article_summary": "Savers currently put after-tax dollars into a 529 account which are run mainly by states.\n\"The President claims that 529 savings plans only help the wealthy, but we couldn't disagree more,\" said Kathryn Flynn, content director at SavingForCollege.com.\nA survey produced by SavingForCollege.com finds that 59% of those who open a 529 account did it mainly to get federal tax benefits.\nIn fact, we found that 73% of SavingforCollege.com visitors that were planning to open a 529 account in the next 12 months had household incomes of less than $150,000.\"\nObama wants to end tax-free withdrawals from these accounts, beginning with new contributions, supposedly to eliminate a tax break for the wealth."}
