In addition to the 1095/1094-C forms the application is also fully equipped to handle the 1095/1094-B health coverage information returns that policy providers will need to distribute and file.

We serve as cost-effective alternative to the more expensive solutions offered by ADP or Paychex.

These ALEs who employ 50+ full-time and full-time equivalent workers (FTEs) have to track and report items like employee status, coverage offered, affordability, and dependents covered. They will then have to translate this into Form 1095-C employee statements in the 2015 filing year. ALEs will also have to deal with converting their data to adhere to new IRS e-file specifications and transmit this using the IRS AIR filing system. Since this reporting is so new, many businesses are scrambling to learn how this will affect them and what solutions are available. TSC1099 stands apart from most because of its low cost and ability to effectively handle the complex logic behind employee tracking and ACA code generation.

Print , mail , and e-file the 1095/1094 form series
