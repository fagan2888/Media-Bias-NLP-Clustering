Trump seems to be a petulant, immature teenager disguised as a self-made billionaire. I do know why he\u2019s doing so well, however. In the aftermath of the Super Tuesday massacre of his fellow Republicans, Trump continues to do well because of two issues: anger and fear. And I get both.\n\nPeople are angry. Angry because of America\u2019s demise and disintegration both at home and abroad; angry because of moral chaos; angry because of a sluggish economy; angry because minority groups are continually allowed to silence the voice of the great majorities; angry because of political lies on the part of our elected officials; angry because of the disconnect between D.C. and the rest of America; angry because the media and political elites rarely meet or remotely understand the concerns of the average American.\n\nWho among us hasn\u2019t fumed and fussed at our kitchen table with friends and family members over the decay of an exceptional America? We\u2019re angry enough to say, \u201cI want someone to go to D.C. and take names, kick butt and keep their word.\" Many in America are so angry that they are willing to let their anger eclipse their reason. And Trump fits this narrative.\n\nFurther, Trump knows people are afraid. Afraid of open borders and the impact of illegal immigration on the job market and our social services infrastructure; afraid of our current, feckless policies toward radical Islam; afraid of a future without a moral and political rudder; afraid that our culture is disintegrating into a cauldron of chaos; afraid to call evil what it is; and afraid that our future is limited and bleak.\n\nAnd who isn't angry and afraid? Liberals and progressives are angry at the development of an oligarchy of new ruling-class elites, the Wall Street 1 percenters. Conservatives are angry because no one seems to care about personal freedom, freedom of speech, religious liberty, personal accountability and constitutional controls.\n\nBoth parties are tired of the current administration\u2019s policy of \"leading from behind\" and the failure to recognize America\u2019s necessary role in the world as a moral, political, economic, military and freedom-loving leader.\n\nTrump plays to our fears and anger like a master musician. He\u2019s also a master marketer, the ultimate deal maker. And he just might win the Republican nomination and the general election to boot. If so, many question what lies on the other side of November. Will the petulance and pettiness continue? Or will Trump rise above the fray to lead us to a new degree of American unity, moral clarity and global leadership? Time will tell.\n\nAll I know is what the Bible says in James 1:20: \"The anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.\u201d In other words, anger, in the long run, usually accomplishes very little. Anger may be the necessary spark to get people moving, but if anger is all a person has, then they will eventually burn down the very thing they\u2019re trying to recover and rescue.\n\nIt remains to be seen if America will burn down the house in an angry, directionless revolution or if we will rediscover and re-embrace a sane, principled, constitutional, morally centered and freedom-loving convictional view of who we are as Americans and our place in this world.\n\nKevin Shrum is pastor of Inglewood Baptist Church.\n\nKevin Shrum (Photo: Submitted)\n\nSynopsis\n\nAmericans are angry over the decay of their country.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1ph2ieU", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Donald Trump plays to our fears and anger like a master musician.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Donald Trump plays to our fears and anger like a master musician.", "title": "Donald Trump's success driven by anger, fear", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2016/03/13/donald-trumps-success-driven-anger-fear/81486112/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump plays to our fears and anger like a master musician.", "title": "Donald Trump's success driven by anger, fear", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33227ee044f467250e5aabe04726559567effd99/c=824-0-4104-3280&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Nashville/Nashville/635794968931863381-GOP-2016-Trump-jbuitrago-tennessean.com-6.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Subjects/Anger", "gci-asset-type": "story", "gci-categories": "Subjects/Anger", "title": "Donald Trump's success driven by anger, fear", "author": "Kevin Shrum", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8384d4bd93e7e79c2ca539ed59e30557550a28ef/c=1234-0-3694-3280/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Nashville/Nashville/635794968931863381-GOP-2016-Trump-jbuitrago-tennessean.com-6.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/20756d175e5b095227a7e41dc57475ea2d727234/c=824-0-4104-3280/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Nashville/Nashville/635794968931863381-GOP-2016-Trump-jbuitrago-tennessean.com-6.jpg", "contenttype": "story", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b826bb5e71c1b82a7cd9281f0d522f82aab768a5/c=283-0-4645-3280/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Nashville/Nashville/635794968931863381-GOP-2016-Trump-jbuitrago-tennessean.com-6.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1c09b7bc11c148324390eb0c03cefd938fa506c8/c=0-147-4926-2930&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Nashville/Nashville/635794968931863381-GOP-2016-Trump-jbuitrago-tennessean.com-6.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-03-13T10:04:49.760000-05:00", "shorthed": "Trump's success driven by anger, fear", "articleid": 81486112, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/082bda190a68df7dea3bdf94d22ee59e3432b8c5/c=0-147-4926-2930/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Nashville/Nashville/635794968931863381-GOP-2016-Trump-jbuitrago-tennessean.com-6.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6fed028e98be30552db30e871b0b5de1ba9d2403/c=1546-0-3383-3280/local/-/media/2015/10/03/Nashville/Nashville/635794968931863381-GOP-2016-Trump-jbuitrago-tennessean.com-6.jpg"}}, "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Super Tuesday, Wall Street, Bernie Sanders, Kevin Shrum, Inglewood Baptist Church, why people support Trump, Trump op-eds, Tennessean editorials"}, "article_summary": "Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (Photo: Mark Zaleski / AP) Story Highlights Americans are angry over the decay of their country.\nIn the aftermath of the Super Tuesday massacre of his fellow Republicans, Trump continues to do well because of two issues: anger and fear.\nMany in America are so angry that they are willing to let their anger eclipse their reason.\nAs a principled, evangelical Christian pastor, I am not excited about Donald Trump\u2019s presidential run or the political tone of either party (you could insert Bernie Sanders' name here as well).\nTrump is a master marketer who plays to our fears and anger."}
