These women reported normal vaginal function as they got older and became sexually active.\n\nAdmittedly science amazes and terrifies me, but I\u2019m glad those who show an actual medical need for prosthestic vaginas like transgenders and women who have undergone some type of female genital mutilation now have a chance at an enjoyable sex life and can feel less self-conscious about their lady parts.\n\nDo you think science is getting ahead of itself or is this a step in the right direction?", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scientists are in the process of making artificial vaginas via stem cells for women with abnormal or missing vaginas.", "og": {"site_name": "MadameNoire", "description": "Scientists are in the process of making artificial vaginas via stem cells for women with abnormal or missing vaginas.", "title": "Forget Fake Booties, Artificial Vaginas Are On The Way", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 420, "identifier": "http://d236bkdxj385sg.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Artificial-Vaginas.jpg", "height": 420}, "url": "http://madamenoire.com/441102/artificial-vaginas/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://d236bkdxj385sg.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Artificial-Vaginas.jpg"}, "title": "Forget Fake Booties, Artificial Vaginas Are On The Way\u2026And It\u2019s A Good Thing", "description": "And at least four women have already undergone the process.", "card": "summary", "site": "@MadameNoire"}, "robots": "noodp", "ob": {"title": "Forget Fake Booties, Artificial Vaginas Are O"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"admins": 100006356380901}, "google-site-verification": "89cYy4uYOnrle-D3H3SPnHJySu32IytBEKjsv1_skZo", "article": {"section": "Beauty", "published_time": "2014-06-22T14:25:16-04:00"}, "y_key": "637ec967f3cf29ad"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd928f\"", "article_summary": "Do you think science is getting ahead of itself or is this a step in the right direction?\nPin this on Pinterest Email this storyHuffington Post is reporting that a New York Magazine infographic is shedding light on advancements in technology and stem-cell research which are making it possible for women to soon be able to receive prosthetic vaginas.\nThese women reported normal vaginal function as they got older and became sexually active.\nBack in April, four young women with missing or abnormal vaginas were implanted with lab-grown vaginas made from their own cells which have proven to be indistinguishable from natural vaginas and have grown with the women who got the implants as teens as they\u2019ve matured.\nAdmittedly science amazes and terrifies me, but I\u2019m glad those who show an actual medical need for prosthestic vaginas like transgenders and women who have undergone some type of female genital mutilation now have a chance at an enjoyable sex life and can feel less self-conscious about their lady parts."}
