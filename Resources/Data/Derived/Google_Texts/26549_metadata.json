There was a lot of leather. And there were a half dozen 2016 presidential hopefuls all vying for votes in the state that will hold the first presidential contest in February.\n\nWith its strong attendance \u2014 both from voters and candidates \u2014 Saturday\u2019s inaugural \u201cRoast and Ride\u201d here in Boone promised to become a must-stop on the path to the 2016 presidential race. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst served as master of ceremonies at an event that she hopes will become the successor to former Sen. Tom Harkin\u2019s \u201csteak fry,\u201d which drew Democratic presidential candidates every four years.\n\nErnst, a Republican, was elected in 2014 as an Iowa farm girl who told voters that after castrating hogs she\u2019d know how to \u201cmake \u2019em squeal\u201d in Washington.\n\nBut she also caught the attention of Hawkeye state voters with an ad where she rode her Harley-Davidson motorcycle to a shooting range and trained her fire on \u201cObamacare,\u201d while making it clear that she carried more than lipstick in her purse.\n\nThe freshman Iowa senator has promised to stay neutral in the 2016 Iowa caucuses, but she rode on the 38-mile ride from Des Moines to Boone with Wisconsin Sen. Scott Walker, a friend and fellow Harley rider.\n\nWalker, who hails from a neighboring state and has won praise from Iowa voters for taking on labor unions in his own state, has led in the polls here in Iowa for several months. But many political strategists here \u2014 who have seen wild swings in recent presidential cycles \u2014 have cautioned that early polls have little significance in determining who will be the winner of the Iowa caucuses in February.\n\nMore than a half dozen campaigns were out in force, trying to organize voters and sign up volunteers. The ride drew hundreds of Harley-Davidson riders, but also many families who were treated with free barbecue, games such as corn hole, and a moon bounce where kids could blow off steam far from the speeches at the podium.\n\nThough Walker had the advantage of riding just behind Ernst into the ride, voters here were clearly open to their options.\n\nRather than ride with the Ernst crowd, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry forged his own path with a ride to Boone from the appropriately named town of Perry, Iowa.\n\n\u201cRide with Rick\u201d was a fundraiser for Puppy Jake, a program that connects veterans with service dogs. Before departing on a motorcycle belonging to an injured veteran, Perry spoke to a crowd surrounded by veterans Marcus Luttrell and Dan Moran, as well as Taya Kyle, widow of American Sniper author Chris Kyle.\n\nAlthough Sen. Marco Rubio wasn\u2019t able to take up Joni Ernst on her offer to ride on the back of her bike, he said he\u2019s planning a different kind of ride.\n\n\u201cIf we could get a jet ski ride, I could take her,\u201d the Floridian told voters near his tent.\n\nOther non-Harley riding candidates \u2014 including Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson \u2014 also had many fans within the crowd in Boone.\n\nStill, Walker may have garnered the most attention after riding into Boone with Ernst. Though he has not yet declared his candidacy, Walker immediately greeted voters upon his arrival, walking along a white picket fence to take photos and shake hands with people on the other side.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a retired teacher and I\u2019m so glad you took on the teachers union,\u201d one woman told him.\n\nWearing a Harley shirt from Des Moines, Walker frequently told people \u201cit was good to ride with Joni\u201d when asked how the ride was. Earlier, in interviews with the press, he was careful to avoid the assertion that he had an advantage in Iowa because of his affinity with motorcycle riders.\n\nOne man he greeted was wearing a handwritten badge that declared he was supporting Walker for president. \u201cAlso Rand Paul for Vice President in 2016,\u201d it also said.\n\nPerry arrived a short time later, with his own pool of bikers behind him. \u201cIt was good to be out on the road,\u201d the wind-blown politician said as he got off his bike and took his helmet off.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee greeted voters under his tent. Many of them told him they hoped he would win the Iowa caucuses for a second time. But Harley riders, admittedly, may not be Huckabee\u2019s niche.\n\nAsked whether he also rode a motorcycle, Huckabee said no: \u201cThere\u2019s just a few things in life I\u2019m not ready to do.\u201d\n\nBy Maeve Reston, Ashley Killough and Betsy Klein", "article_metadata": {"description": "BOONE, Iowa -- It was loud.
