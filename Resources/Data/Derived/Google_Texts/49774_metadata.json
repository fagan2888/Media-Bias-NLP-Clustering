She started off by mentioning how \u201cas a woman I like Donald Trump, but as a full-blown nut job, I freaking love him.\u201d\n\nHughes was willing to defend Trump on everything, with her responses getting more ridiculous as the segment went on. She assured Bouldon that \u201cI\u2019ll be able to\u201d defend whatever it was, before she even heard Bouldon\u2019s charge against Trump. She tried to assure Bouldon \u201cyou can\u2019t break me, Kate, because I\u2019m crazy, and crazy don\u2019t break!\u201d\n\nHughes claimed that Trump retweeting the unflattering photo of Heidi Cruz next to Melania Trump \u201cwas an accident, okay, because Donald\u2019s hands are just so big, he can\u2019t see everything his fingers retweet.\u201d\n\nOn Trump\u2019s initial answer that women who have had abortions should be \u201cpunished,\u201d Hughes chalked it to up to an April Fool\u2019s joke. He made those comments on March 30 as Bouldon pointed out, but with crazy laughter, Hughes tried to answer \u201cthat\u2019s why it\u2019s so funny.\u201d\n\nThe segment also got into how Trump flatters his daughter, Ivanka, perhaps a bit too much. Darrell Hammond as Trump is shown at a rally complimenting his daughter, which includes \u201cwhat a rack,\u201d which is \u201cjust tremendous\u201d since she just had a baby.\n\nHughes said such comments were \u201cbeautiful,\u201d and that Bouldon \u201cis just trying to work it, but is it worth it? You put his thing down, flipped it, and reversed it.\u201d She also offered that Trump at least \u201cis creating a dialogue about women.\u201d\n\nBouldon and Hughes were at least able to agree Trump \u201cis way better than Ted Cruz\u201d at the segment\u2019s close.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "NGFB Pro 7.8.4U", "og": {"site_name": "Red Alert Politics", "description": "Image via screenshot.
