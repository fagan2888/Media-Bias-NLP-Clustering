That debate has gone in any number of directions, but it\u2019s often slipped into some well-worn right-left grooves, with writers on the feminist left tilting at capital-p Patriarchy and \u201ctraditional masculinity\u201d and conservative commentators dismissing their arguments as victimology and ideological overreach. And as in another recent controversy, on rape and campus life, I\u2019m a little dissatisfied with my own side\u2019s approach: In their haste to critique too-sweeping indictments of masculinity/male privilege/\u201drape culture\u201d/etc., it seems to me, some conservatives risk foreclosing the possibility that misogyny might be a real cultural problem, to which a certain amount of moral outrage and a certain kind of structural critique might both be healthy, legitimate responses.\n\nI should emphasize that I understand the desire not to make too much of a single disturbed individual\u2019s worldview. And as my column\u2019s beginning suggested, I also understand the case that \u2014 for reasons of deterrence \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t give a mass murderer any attention whatsoever.\n\nBut once the debate has been joined and carried on for a while, it seems insufficient to say, \u201cwell, this guy was just crazy\u201d in a case where it\u2019s very, very easy to pick out the thick cultural veins that his madness battened on. And when those veins carry a toxic flow of, well, woman-hatred, it seems important for conservatives to acknowledge as much without worrying that they\u2019re somehow surrendering crucial territory to left-wing scolds.\n\nEspecially when that territory actually supplies a modest amount of what could be moral common ground. That is, it should be possible, in these debates, for the right to offer a nuanced analysis of cultural liberalism\u2019s contradictions \u2014 pointing out, for instance, that certain expressions of the male grotesque are just what the left\u2019s longed-for liberation actually looks like \u2014 without denying that when it passes judgment on particular grotesqueries, a \u201cstrident\u201d and \u201cscolding\u201d feminism is often straightforwardly correct. And it should be possible, too, for cultural conservatives to qualify and critique certain left-wing conceits without denying their partial validity. I\u2019m thinking, for instance, of a phrase like \u201crape culture,\u201d which when applied to the entirety of American society does, indeed, risk, becoming an impossibly broad indictment that minimizes the evil of actual rapists \u2026 but which if applied more narrowly, to particular institutions and atmospheres, starts to look like an idea that conservatives should actively embrace.\n\nThis point holds particularly strongly in contexts, like Silicon Valley or many college campuses, where cultural conservatism has no real footprint, and certain kinds of feminism are often the only moralistic game in town. I would rather not have to choose, as you might imagine, between a society run by the \u201cbros\u201d of Snapchat and RapGenius and a society run by the editors of Jezebel, between a culture dominated by a corporate, \u201cparty culture is good for our bottom line\u201d neoliberalism and a culture whose norms are policed by the Javerts and DeFarges of the campus left. But when such non-conservative forces clash, it\u2019s a mistake for conservatives to always treat feminists as their clear ideological enemy, and feminism\u2019s targets as clear victims in need of right-wing solidarity and support.\n\nWhere the feminist left abuses power or abets injustice in these controversies, of course criticism is warranted. But it stills needs to be qualified, nuanced criticism, rather than a blanket denunciation that leaves the right effectively carrying water for the not-so-wonderful, not-even-remotely-conservative culture of masculinity embodied by an Evan Spiegel, a Seth MacFarlane, or a Tucker Max.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140602133837, "twitter": {"description": "Why the cultural right shouldn\u2019t reflexively disagree with the feminist left.", "title": "The Right and Misogyny", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/the-right-and-misogyny/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@DouthatNYT", "card": "summary"}, "sourceApp": "blogs", "blogpostid": 100000002915315, "DISPLAYDATE": "June 2, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1401730717, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/rossdouthat/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "modified_time": "2014-06-02T17:43:01-04:00", "tag": "Uncategorized", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp"}, "keywords": "Max Tucker,Spiegel Evan,Conservatism (US Politics),Men and Boys,Sex Crimes,Women's Rights,Snapchat Inc,Santa Barbara (Calif),Silicon Valley (Calif),Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/douthat/The Right and Misogyny ( 20140602 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "douthat", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/douthat", "per": "Max, Tucker;Spiegel, Evan", "BN": "douthat", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/douthat/post", "description": "Why the cultural right shouldn\u2019t reflexively disagree with the feminist left.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "June 2, 2014", "org": "Snapchat Inc", "geo": "Santa Barbara (Calif);Silicon Valley (Calif)", "utime": 20140602174301, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140602, "pdate": 20140602, "des": "Conservatism (US Politics);Men and Boys;Sex Crimes;Women's Rights", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Ross Douthat", "description": "Why the cultural right shouldn\u2019t reflexively disagree with the feminist left.", "title": "The Right and Misogyny", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/the-right-and-misogyny/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/the-right-and-misogyny/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "The Right and Misogyny", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0e82\"", "article_summary": "And it should be possible, too, for cultural conservatives to qualify and critique certain left-wing conceits without denying their partial validity.\nMy column yesterday joined the crowded debate over the cultural significance (if any) of the Santa Barbara killer\u2019s radioactive, misogynistic, sexually-frustrated rage.\nI should emphasize that I understand the desire not to make too much of a single disturbed individual\u2019s worldview.\nWhere the feminist left abuses power or abets injustice in these controversies, of course criticism is warranted.\nBut it stills needs to be qualified, nuanced criticism, rather than a blanket denunciation that leaves the right effectively carrying water for the not-so-wonderful, not-even-remotely-conservative culture of masculinity embodied by an Evan Spiegel, a Seth MacFarlane, or a Tucker Max."}
