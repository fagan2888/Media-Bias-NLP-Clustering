The study zeroed in on 17 hospitals that were able to beat the weekend effect, studying 21 separate hospital resources and analyzing how these factors worked together to improve outcomes.\n\nFive factors played a particularly key role:\n\nA lower number of beds per nurse: Hospitals that focus on improved staffing ratios were \"1.44 times more likely to overcome the weekend effect.\"\n\nHospitals that focus on improved staffing ratios were \"1.44 times more likely to overcome the weekend effect.\" An integrated home health care program: The weekend effect was less pronounced at institutions that provide patients with home visits by skilled home healthcare workers who help with wound care and the administration of medications.\n\nThe weekend effect was less pronounced at institutions that provide patients with home visits by skilled home healthcare workers who help with wound care and the administration of medications. Fully electronic medical records systems: These help healthcare providers avoid medical errors and redundant care. Hospitals with electronic records were 4.74 times more likely to beat the weekend effect.\n\nThese help healthcare providers avoid medical errors and redundant care. Hospitals with electronic records were 4.74 times more likely to beat the weekend effect. Inpatient physical rehabilitation programs: These programs help healthcare providers determine who will need additional help at home, such as patients with a risk of falls.\n\nThese programs help healthcare providers determine who will need additional help at home, such as patients with a risk of falls. Programs for pain management: \"Seventy percent of hospitals that overcame the weekend effect had pain management programs, compared with 49.3 percent of hospitals that had persistent weekend effects.\"\n\nThe Loyola researchers published their findings in the October, 2015 edition of the journal Annals of Surgery.\n\nThe study's senior author Paul Kuo, M.D., said in the announcement that the improved staffing ratios, inpatient and aftercare resources \"can play an important role in ensuring patients are not disadvantaged by being admitted to the hospital on the weekend.\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- read the Loyola study announcement\n\n- here's the study abstract\n\nRelated articles:\n\nHospital death rates support the 'weekend effect' phenomenon\n\nThe \"weekend effect\" in urgent general operative procedures\n\nHealthcare needs 'care coordination records' to better manage patient care\n\nFrom coast to coast, nurses push for staffing level legislation\n\nHospitals, nurses clash on staffing ratios", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hospitals can take five actions to fight the higher rate of complications, mortalities and readmissions for surgical patients who undergo emergency procedures on the weekend, also known as the \"weekend effect,\"\u00a0according to\u00a0a Loyola University Medical Center and Loyola University Chicago study.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Hospitals can take five actions to fight the higher rate of complications, mortalities and readmissions for surgical patients who undergo emergency procedures on the weekend, also known as the \"weekend effect,\"\u00a0according to\u00a0a Loyola University Medical Center and Loyola University Chicago study.", "title": "5 ways hospitals can beat the 'weekend effect' in surgical outcomes", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/5-ways-hospitals-can-beat-weekend-effect-surgical-outcomes/2015-10-09", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "Care Delivery,Electronic Medical Records,emergency procedures,home health,inpatient physical rehab,Loyola University Medical Center,Operations & Business Management,Pain Management,Patient Care & Outcomes,Staffing Ratios,weekend effect", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Operations & Business Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd6ea0\"", "article_summary": "Programs for pain management: \"Seventy percent of hospitals that overcame the weekend effect had pain management programs, compared with 49.3 percent of hospitals that had persistent weekend effects.\"\nHospitals with electronic records were 4.74 times more likely to beat the weekend effect.\nThe study zeroed in on 17 hospitals that were able to beat the weekend effect, studying 21 separate hospital resources and analyzing how these factors worked together to improve outcomes.\nHospitals that focus on improved staffing ratios were \"1.44 times more likely to overcome the weekend effect.\"\nThese programs help healthcare providers determine who will need additional help at home, such as patients with a risk of falls."}
