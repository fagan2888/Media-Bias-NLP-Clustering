This is a previous commentary from December 2014 which I felt was worth posting again. At the top is my introduction in italics. This commentary isn't meant to be an endorsement of Angle. I'm agnostic on Angle vs. Heck. Angle has the potential to be a much more effective evil than Heck. The establishment neocons have selected pseudo opposition who target them not on foreign policy, but issues like immigration. That said, Angle would probably represent her constituents much better than Heck. Between Angle and Heck, Angle is the one who has thanked me for supporting the Constitution, after I thanked her for running in 2010. Conversely, Heck's people treated me like a pariah for supporting the Constitution. It's why Heck must not be elected to the Senate. The reason I believe this commentary is worth posting again is because it rebuts Chuck Muth's recent piece making a case for Heck over Angle. Rather than defending free market principles, Muth rationalizes bad behavior. See: http://www.nevadaappeal.com/news/opinion/21309809-113/nevadas-mitt-romney-suits-up-to-choke-again I'm not saying Angle isn't a neocon and should necessarily be supported, but that Muth's calculus is flawed. How so? Heck is given a pass for his statist voting record because he represents a district that leans left. Therefore, pursuant to Muth, Heck has to appeal to voters on the left. All Muth does - albeit, unintentionally - is help demolish the left-right paradigm by admitting Republicans are aping Democrats. Why? Look at the areas Heck is considered to be a \"conservative\" (e.g. foreign policy and national security). On those issues, Joe Heck overlaps with the uber hawk Hillary Clinton. So why is it people believe an interventionist foreign policy is a conservative foreign policy if statists like Clinton also embrace an interventionist foreign policy? Support for a non-interventionist, constitutional foreign policy is considered to be a left wing position. Yet establishment Democrats like Clinton and Catherine Cortez Masto overlap with people like Heck on foreign policy. If, as Muth claims, Heck is trying to appeal to the left, then why not cut into Masto's base by opposing her support for a promiscuous foreign policy rather than buttress her base by accusing her of being too non-interventionist? Or why doesn't Joe Heck come out against the practice of torture, rather than support torture like he does? Far from running to the \"left\" on issues like torture, Republicans are adamantly in favor of its use. Republicans say they need to appeal to the left, but not if it's a matter of upholding the rule of law. In that case, treat the torture critic like a pariah. If your name is Steve Sebelius and your point of attack is that Heck is too laissez-fairish, Republicans will listen. If your name is Jon Ralston and you give Heck a pass on torture suggesting that he is in any way fit to be a Congressman, Republicans will listen. If your name is Wayne Allyn Root and you say President Obama should be arrested for not making more war while supporting Republicans, Republicans will listen. If you point out that torture is an attack on due process and incompatible with small government conservatism, you're a pariah. Whatever reinforces the faux left-right paradigm is permissible. Whatever exposes the left-right paradigm as faux is impermissible. Debating amnesty for immigrants is permissible. Debating amnesty for war criminals is impermissible. It's okay to oppose Republicans and Democrats for the wrong reasons. It's not okay to oppose Republicans and Democrats for the right reasons. Even when the two major parties engage on real issues, it's meant to obfuscate. Republicans, like Democrats, support big government at home and big government abroad. Heck's support for statism has nothing to do with appealing to voters on the left any more than Clinton tries to appeal to voters on the right by supporting a promiscuous foreign policy. It's about two parties colluding to commit crimes. Murray Rothbard's law is that people tend to specialize in what they are worst at. Republicans are the worst at foreign policy. What do Republicans attack their Democrat opponents over the most? Foreign policy. Democrats are the worst at economic policy. What do Democrats attack their Republican opponents over the most? Economic policy.[1] The parlance of both major parties and the establishment media embellishes contrast between the two major parties. The Republicans will accuse Democrats of opposing them, while the Democrats will accuse Republicans of opposing them. The quarrels and rules of engagement seem designed to conceal the similarity between the two parties, in an effort to create a fiction of choice. Neither major party has an interest in exposing itself as being no different from the other. If Republicans confessed to being no different than the Democrats, they would give Republican voters no compelling reason to vote for them. If Democrats confessed to being no different than the Republicans, they would give Democrat voters no compelling reason to vote for them. Look at how several years ago Republicans attacked Harry Reid for his comments re: the Iraq war. Pursuant to Republicans, because Senator Reid said the war is lost, that made him intolerably soft on war. Yet, the real record (i.e. war funding votes) shows that the war policy has been sustained with bipartisan acquiescence, including the support of Senator Reid.[2] Democrats attack Republicans for being opposed to \"Obamacare\", fueling the erroneous belief that Republicans support free markets. Yet, the real record shows that the government has been expanded with bipartisan acquiescence, including the support of people like Congressman Joe Heck. Republicans accuse Democrats of being insufficiently supportive of the war on terror, while Democrats accuse Republicans of being insufficiently supportive of big government. That's only if the two major parties spend any time at all discussing issues rather than engaging in diversionary personal attacks. While candidates in both parties will engage in ad hominem attacks over petty matters, most serious crimes carried out as a matter of policy by the highest levels of government are given a pass. With this construction of confusion, which seems to be deliberate, it's no enigma as to why voters are incapable of holding their government accountable. How many Americans still believe former President Bush cut taxes? Or that the asset price collapse of 2008 was not only an unwelcome event (rather than a purgative event), but was the result of unrestrained laissez-faire rather than central bank efforts to create pseudo prices? Rank and file party members are letting the opposition party define their political paradigm without even being cognizant that they are doing so. How many Republicans believe Joe Heck supports free markets? Can those Republicans name a single department Heck wants to abolish or a single gun law he's trying to repeal? They believe he supports free markets because Democrats accuse him of supporting free markets. This same truth applies to Democrats on the matter of foreign policy. Erin Bilbray had an opportunity to defeat Joe Heck. As if colluding with Joe Heck, she deployed on all the wrong issues. That we were lied into war is indisputably true. But not once did she challenge Joe Heck over his support for a promiscuous foreign policy. Bilbray never challenged Heck over his support for torture. Rather than cutting into his support by highlighting his votes for promiscuous spending, she helped buttress his support by accusing him of being too laissez-faire for allegedly trying to dismantle \"Obamacare\".[3] Even if the media weren't complicit in the deception, it's failing to do its job by not asking the right questions. Consider this: http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nevada/us-house-votes-extend-50-tax-breaks-another-year Running with the story's narrative, we must have two conservative parties, with both working to cut taxes. If you support free markets, you can go to sleep. Both parties now agree with libertarians, which prompts the question: what's impermissible about advocating free markets? Platitudes aside, there has been Congressional homogeneity on spending - especially war spending. Year-over-year, spending has been increasing not just in real terms but in nominal terms. To help finance this bipartisan spending orgy, the government creates new money out-of-thin-air (i.e. inflation). There is no objective difference between the government taking the money you have in your pocket and duplicating the money you have in your pocket, consequently devaluing the money you have. This is a stealth tax, called the inflation tax, which we feel with higher prices and a higher cost-of-living. Even if we get an occasional reprieve with falling prices, the real issue is not the direction of nominal prices, but what prices would otherwise be absent central bank manipulation. So long as the bipartisan spending orgy is left intact, we will not have had a real cut in the tax burden. If all the politicians do is cut apparent, or transparent, taxes, while leaving the spending orgy intact, then this increases the stealth tax of inflation. Government spending must be paid for one way or another. Cuts of particular taxes in juxtaposition with increases in spending should not be conflated with a cut in the aggregate tax burden. Let's call this nominal cuts with a real increase. If you believe I'm wrong, that's tantamount to believing that costs aren't measured by outlays but by income. Furthermore, how many tax breaks are extended to beneficiaries of the tax and expenditure process? Do government employees or contractors benefit with any of these tax breaks? How can the tax burden be cut by extending tax breaks to people paid out of revenue derived from taxation? Let there be no confusion about what these tax breaks are: a means for social engineering through the redistribution of wealth, marketed with free market sounding rhetoric. They're subsidies in disguise. By camouflaging statism with free market sounding rhetoric, this makes statism sound much more benign. The latest sellout was the vote on a resolution which is the prelude to war with Russia. Every member of the Nevada Congressional delegation, Republicans and Democrats, voted for the resolution. See: http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2014/roll548.xml When Congress starts war with Russia, who will pay for the war in blood and treasure? How can members of Congress (e.g. Joe Heck) who are planning war against Russia over Ukraine[4] claim accolades for cutting taxes with straight faces? Is Joe Heck that delusional? Why is Joe Heck in office? Because Erin Bilbray helped re-elect him. Perhaps Democrats are incapable of opposing Republicans on the right issues because if they do they would have to campaign against themselves. Now we have two parties that have triangulated in on the worst of the other party's positions. Are candidates like Erin Bilbray Republicans, or are members of Congress like Joe Heck Democrats? Does it even matter?

[2] - Pursuant to Republicans, the war has still not been won and more troops should return to Iraq and remain indefinitely. Harry Reid's voting record in favor of war funding aside, was he right about Iraq? And if Senator Reid isn't even permitted to say the Iraq war is lost, while simultaneously voting to appropriate funding for the war, without having his loyalty called into question, then how much less permissible it must be for a person like me to oppose wars? [3] - I have seen no evidence that indicates Republicans are trying to repeal \"Obamacare\", as if returning to the day before \"Obamacare\" gets us to a free market. The loss of coverage due to \"Obamacare\" is damage that can only be repaired by going full monty on the complete separation of medicine and state (e.g. abolishing the FDA and repealing medical licensing laws), which can never be achieved if we table that discussion. Over time, people will figure out that the purpose of the Affordable Care Act is not to provide medical care to everybody, but to create a medical tyranny. [4] - I believe it may not have anything to do with Ukraine. That might be the excuse for using the military to try to fix the price of oil upwards, as it is the United States - not Russia - that's leveraged at pseudo prices. Biography - Mark Alvarez Mark served honorably for four years on active duty in the Marine Corps infantry. He received a meritorious promotion which required having to go up for a board and answer several questions about Marine Corps knowledge. Contrary to rumors, having no Non-judicial Punishments, he received the Good Conduct Medal on his three year mark. He believes God created the Marines to topple the lawless government in Washington. He was dually endorsed by the Libertarian Party and the Constitution Party when he ran for a municipal office in 2002. He re-enlisted in the ARNG in 2006 because he missed the military and was honorably discharged. He has helped expose how the VA medical system exists to undermine the rights of veterans by creating faux medical records, as about 99% of his VA medical records are faux. Having a collegiate GPA of 4.0 so far, he stood on principle refusing to take anything from the taxpayer to go to school. He started Veterans for Ron Paul in 2007 (contrary to the claims somebody else started it, which he can prove), which had several hundred members, and then a separate Veterans for Ron Paul was created later by somebody else. He has held the NFA Series 3 license (futures and futures options broker) which he did a voluntary withdrawal on because he couldn't in good conscience sell managed futures, which are designed for institutional clients, since firms would do better to hire an in-house trader to trade a proprietary account with a discount broker rather than allocating assets into a managed futures account, which he outlined in his well-written withdrawal request. He's proud to say that he never bagged a single client for MF Global because if he had bagged a client it would have been for MF Global, since he was hired by MF Global. He can assist your company in developing a hedging strategy. He believes silver bullion is on sale. His commentaries have been carried by sites like Antiwar.com. He takes pride in the fact he's a commentator, not a journalist. He works two jobs - one full time and the other part time - which take up 6 to 7 days per week. Since the year 2000, he has spent much of his free time reading the great minds of the Austrian School of economics, such as Murray Rothbard, Henry Hazlitt, Ludwig von Mises, et al.
