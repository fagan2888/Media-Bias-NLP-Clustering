Supporters gathered in the gymnasium of Central Falls High School to hear the presidential hopeful speak at length about her platform and plan for taking the White House.\n\nFrom the onset Clinton sought to associate herself with Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential administration, proudly declaring that \u201cmore people were raised out of poverty in those eight years than in any comparable decade.\u201d\n\nShe contrasted this apparent success with the Republican administration that followed her husband\u2019s. Specifically, she blamed the Bush administration for \u201ctanking the economy,\u201d something she said hit Rhode Islanders especially hard. \u201cThere is a direct connection between the failed economic policies of Republicans and what happened to millions of Americans,\u201d Clinton said.\n\nClinton made a number of sweeping promises throughout the rally including equal pay for women, an increase in available programs for the treatment of addiction and an expansion of the Affordable Care Act. She likened Obamacare to her own \u201cHillarycare\u201d \u2014 the failed health care plan she proposed while she was first lady.\n\nClinton also addressed ending loopholes for gun sellers at length, characterizing the gun deaths facing Americans as an epidemic. \u201cIf something else was killing 33,000 people, we\u2019d be organizing right now to save lives,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile her goals may have seemed lofty, Clinton promised that she was serious about achieving change if elected and urged voters to monitor her ability to accomplish things moving forward. \u201cI want you to hold me accountable,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not making promises I can\u2019t keep.\u201d\n\nThis sentiment was echoed by some Brown students who attended the event. \u201cThere are a lot of students who feel that Hillary is the most pragmatic choice and the most promising candidate to move the Democratic platform forward,\u201d said Sarah Jackson \u201916, a member of Brown Students for Hillary. While a number of Brown students support Sanders, Jackson added that she believes most would be willing to back Clinton if she wins the nomination. \u201cEspecially given the Republican nominee, people will definitely want to rally against them. \u2026 That will help to solidify Democratic support for Hillary,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cShe laid out a very clear mission for what she wants to do and how she wants to make America much better,\u201d said Jeffrey Salvadore \u201917, president of Brown Democrats. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m supporting her \u2014 because she has really achievable goals, and she knows how to communicate them really well.\u201d\n\nIn her campaign, Clinton has received wide support from Rhode Island politicians and figures and was introduced on Saturday by U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, D-RI, U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, D-RI and U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI. She was also introduced by Gov. Gina Raimondo, who praised Clinton\u2019s plan to \u201cbuild an economy from the middle up, not the top down.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. David Cicilline \u201983, D-RI, stumped for Clinton on campus Friday along with Cecile Richards \u201980, president of Planned Parenthood, and Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan. Cicilline praised Clinton\u2019s experience and capabilities as a leader, something he contrasted with the characteristics of her Democratic Primary opponent, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-VT.\n\n\u201cBernie has good ideas, but Hillary is tested against Republican attacks,\u201d Cicilline said. At the rally Saturday Clinton rarely mentioned Sanders, whom she referred to as her \u201cesteemed opponent,\u201d and instead focused her criticism on the Republican presidential candidates whose tones she deemed vitriolic and dangerous.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump keeps saying things, and if we buy them, shame on us,\u201d Clinton said, adding, \u201cHe wants to go after every right we have.\u201d Clinton often used Trump\u2019s infamously controversial statements to demonstrate his inability to lead, especially in terms of foreign policy.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re trying to form a coalition against ISIS, you can\u2019t insult the religion of your coalition members,\u201d Clinton said, referring to Trump\u2019s proposal of a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-TX, was also in Clinton\u2019s crosshairs, receiving a mention for comments he has made about special policing of Muslims in New York.\n\n\u201cThe best response to this comes from the NYPD commissioner himself: Ted Cruz doesn\u2019t know what the hell he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Clinton said, referring to Commissioner William Bratton\u2019s comments on the issue. Clinton limited her criticisms to Trump and Cruz, not once mentioning Republican candidate Gov. John Kasich by name.\n\nClinton herself is performing well in Rhode Island. A Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy poll released Sunday found that Clinton leads Sanders by nine percentage points \u2014 43 percent to 34 percent \u2014 among likely primary voters.\n\nDespite her strong showing, Clinton still tried to garner every vote possible, imploring audience members to vote in the upcoming primary. \u201cIf you vote for me Tuesday, I will stand up and fight for you through this campaign all the way into the White House,\u201d she said.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Brown Daily Herald", "description": "Hillary Clinton held a rally in Central Falls Saturday to drum up support ahead of the Rhode Island Democratic primary, which will take place April 26.", "title": "Clinton campaigns in R.I. before primary", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Borowski_Clinton_Brittany-Comunale.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-04-24T23:29:20+00:00", "url": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/2016/04/25/clinton-campaigns-in-r-i-before-primary/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Metro", "tag": "Top Stories", "published_time": "2016-04-25T00:03:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T23:29:20+00:00"}, "description": "Hillary Clinton held a rally in Central Falls Saturday to drum up support ahead of the Rhode Island Democratic primary, which will take place April 26.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Kyle Borowski"}, "article_summary": "Hillary Clinton held a rally in Central Falls Saturday to drum up support ahead of the Rhode Island Democratic primary, which will take place April 26.\nWhile a number of Brown students support Sanders, Jackson added that she believes most would be willing to back Clinton if she wins the nomination.\nDespite her strong showing, Clinton still tried to garner every vote possible, imploring audience members to vote in the upcoming primary.\nA Taubman Center for American Politics and Policy poll released Sunday found that Clinton leads Sanders by nine percentage points \u2014 43 percent to 34 percent \u2014 among likely primary voters.\n\u201cThere is a direct connection between the failed economic policies of Republicans and what happened to millions of Americans,\u201d Clinton said."}
