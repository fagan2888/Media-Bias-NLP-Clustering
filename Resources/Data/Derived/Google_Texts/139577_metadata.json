Two years ago, doctors diagnosed the young mother with breast cancer.\n\n\"Treated it and went into remission,\" she said.\n\nBut the cancer returned when she least expected it.\n\n\u201cI think I was more in denial. I wanted to believe what everyone told me, \u2018Oh, when you're 30 and pregnant it\u2019s so different, everything changes,\u2019\u201d Pint said.\n\n-- Video: Mother diagnosed with cancer, again, after giving birth\n\nPint felt a lot of pain during her third trimester of pregnancy. She never thought there would be a problem, but as her baby was growing inside her, so was the cancer.\n\nThe young mother didn't catch it until after Garret was born.\n\n\n\n\u201cNot only had it come out of remission, but it was already at stage 4,\u201d she said.\n\nFrom her breast to her bones, her lung and liver, the disease spread.\n\n\u201cSome doctors think it\u2019s because of all the hormonal changes while I was pregnant that caused it to come back,\u201d Pint said. \"But, I really, I can't go there at all. It's a miracle that he was even born, and it's a miracle that I want to hang onto.\"\n\nHanging on to hope, her family finds strength and support from friends and from their faith. They need it more than ever moving forward with treatments.\n\n\u201cI've never felt so loved and supported as I do right now,\u201d she said.\n\nThe family needs financial support, too. Pint\u2019s husband had left his job to start a new career when the cancer came back, and the family doesn't have health insurance. Friends are hosting a fundraiser this Saturday from 1-5 p.m. at the Reed Center in Bellevue.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Local News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Wed, 02 Apr 2014 22:26:36 CDT", "generator": "ibPublish 2", "author": "Melissa Fry", "og": {"site_name": "KETV", "description": "Just weeks after having her baby, doctors deliver devastating news to an Iowa mom.", "title": "Mom delivers baby, gets shocking health scare", "url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/mom-delivers-baby-finds-shocking-health-scare/25294466", "image": "http://www.ketv.com/image/view/-/25294728/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/eukrfrz/-/Pint-family.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.ketv.com/news/mom-delivers-baby-finds-shocking-health-scare/25294466", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "ketv://content/article/25294466", "iphone": "ketv://content/article/25294466", "googleplay": "ketv://content/article/25294466"}, "name": {"ipad": "ketv", "iphone": "ketv", "googleplay": "ketv"}, "id": {"ipad": 505254249, "iphone": 505254249, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}}, "site": "@ketv", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "ketv://content/article/25294466", "app_name": "ketv", "package": "com.hearst.android.ketv"}, "ios": {"url": "ketv://content/article/25294466", "app_store_id": 505254249, "app_name": "ketv"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 130967633662636}, "google-site-verification": "a0PMTzs25l6fcC16_88mc37ga4Phf53uYiDWwMp4Ois", "keywords": "baby, cancer, Glenwood, Iowa, Danielle Pint", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/MelissaFry7"}, "news_keywords": "baby, cancer, Glenwood, Iowa, Danielle Pint", "description": "Just weeks after having her baby, doctors deliver devastating news to an Iowa mom."}, "article_summary": "Pint isn't talking about the challenges of raising three young boys, she's talking about her health.\nThe young mother didn't catch it until after Garret was born.\n\u201cSome doctors think it\u2019s because of all the hormonal changes while I was pregnant that caused it to come back,\u201d Pint said.\nTwo years ago, doctors diagnosed the young mother with breast cancer.\nJust weeks after having her baby, doctors delivered devastating news to an Iowa mom."}
