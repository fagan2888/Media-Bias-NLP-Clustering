And in Maryland, Massachusetts and Illinois. Income tax increases aimed at the rich simply drive them away.\n\nLook at what happened in Britain. They raised the top tax rate to 50 percent, and two-thirds of the millionaires disappeared in the next tax year. Same things are happening in France. People are leaving where the top tax rate is 75 percent. Same thing happened in Maryland a few years ago. New millionaire\u2019s tax, the millionaires disappeared. You\u2019ve got exactly the same thing in California.\n\nAll of these places can expect more migration.\n\nCompare it to Texas. The people are flooding in. Almost eight percent of America\u2019s homes are in the Lone Star State. If it were its own country, it would have the 13th highest GDP in the world. Over the last 20 years, Texas has become an increasingly important part of the US economy. In 1995, it made up around 6.5% of the total US GDP, and by 2014 it was over 9%.\n\nWhy? Taxes are low, spending is under control and jobs are on the rise. That\u2019s the model America needs to replicate.\n\nIt\u2019s great that the American people woke up and realized what liberalism is all about: \u201cEverything I don\u2019t like must be banned. Everything I like is a human right and must be paid for by others.\u201d\n\nBring on 2016.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Almost eight percent of Americas homes are in the Lone Star State.
