A former National Football League defensive end and three others have been charged in a $50 million life insurance fraud scheme.

Byron Frisch, 36, a Brigham Young University standout who played for the New York Giants, Tennessee Titans, Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers from 2000-2004, was arraigned in federal court in San Diego, Calif., for his part in the alleged scam.

Frisch is now an insurance broker in La Jolla, Calif. He and fellow broker Kristian Giordano, 36, were charged with fraudulently causing life insurance companies to issue more than $50 million worth of policies to unqualified applicants who had no intention of paying the policy premiums.

San Diego attorneys Kasra Sadr, 43, and Brenda Barrera Merriles, 43, were also charged.

According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California, the defendants recruited elderly individuals to apply for “free” life insurance policies with million-dollar death benefits. The defendants allegedly obtained more than $1.6 million and the ability to sell the fraudulently obtained life insurance policies to investors.

The conspirators then turned around and submitted fraudulent applications to the life insurance companies by omitting or lying about the applicant’s net worth, income or source of payments, according to the charges. They hid the fact that they were paying all or part of the policy premiums and were going to sell the policies on the secondary market for large profits, prosecutors contend.
