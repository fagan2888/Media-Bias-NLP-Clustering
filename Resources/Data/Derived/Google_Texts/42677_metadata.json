The measure is being viewed as part of the anti-Semitic Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which is behind multiple efforts to isolate Israel from the halls of academia.\n\nWhile supporters of the measure argue that Israel\u2019s visa policies are unfair to Arab and Palestinian academics, opponents of the boycott resolution say that the debate is rooted in anti-Semitism and unfairly targets the Jewish state for undue criticism.\n\nWith the June 1 deadline to vote on the measure approaching, debate about it appears to have spiraled out of control. Recent comments found on the internal MLA listserv show that some supporters of the resolution have engaged in what human rights scholars described as anti-Semitic rhetoric.\n\nProfessor Elizabeth Ordonez, a retired Spanish professor from Metropolitan State University in Denver, accused \u201cZionist attack dogs\u201d of pressuring the resolution\u2019s supporters.\n\n\u201cAs on the broader political scene, moves to seek justice and opportunity for Palestinians (or to remove obstacles to achieving those goals) are countered by Zionist attack dogs,\u201d Ordonez wrote in a March 22 post on the listserv. \u201cWhen the Zionist lobby railroads its way through Congress, universities, and civil society no request is made for equal time for the other side.\u201d\n\nOrdonez, who refers to controversial Palestinian academic Edward Said as \u201cour beloved late leader,\u201d went on to urge her colleagues to vote \u201cyes\u201d on the boycott measure.\n\nAnother listserv member, Professor Basem Ra\u2019ad of the Palestinian Al Quds University, defended Ordonez\u2019s comments and condemned the \u201cunfair pressures being exercised on universities by Zionist funders and lobby groups.\u201d\n\nRa\u2019ad, whose university has faced criticism for holding Hamas terror rallies, goes on to claim that critics of the resolution \u201ccontrol and twist the media.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are some out there who have shown intolerance, who control and twist the media, who silence the truth, who flex their muscle, who organize unfair and biased campaign, who have even pushed the U.S. to wars for Israel\u2019s sake, and who have worked their money or influence to destroy academics or students who express solidarity with the Palestinian cause or any criticism of what should be, to any fair human, an unbearable situation that needs to be rectified,\u201d Ra\u2019ad wrote.\n\nHowever, one professor in particular, Alessio Lerro of Temple University in Philadelphia, flatly accused \u201cJewish scholars\u201d of manipulating academia, a comment that has sparked charges of anti-Semitism in the MLA debate.\n\n\u201cIt is time that Zionists are asked to finally account for their support to the illegal occupation of Palestine since 1967,\u201d Lerro wrote. \u201cThis resolution rightly targets only Israel given the humongous influence that Jewish scholars have in the decision making process of Academia in general.\u201d\n\nThe comment came as a shock to many on the listserv.\n\n\u201cProf. Lerro is engaging in anti-Semitic hate speech, and it should not be tolerated,\u201d wrote Peter Herman in response to the comment.\n\n\u201cThis age-old anti-Semitic stereotype surely puts the lie to claims that the resolution incites only reasoned, fact-checked discussion,\u201d wrote Phyllis Lasner, a Jewish studies professor at Northwestern University.\n\nOthers on the listserv doubled down.\n\n\u201cI am pleased to see the tactfulness of the Palestinian resolution, as I\u2019m tired of Zionists constantly carping at those who support Palestinian rights \u2026 such as this Jewish American,\u201d wrote Professor Richard Pressman, a communications teacher at St. Mary\u2019s University in Texas.\n\nLerro\u2019s comments were particularly shocking to human rights scholars given his recent questioning of the Holocaust on Facebook.\n\nIn response to a January post on Holocaust Remembrance Day, Lerro questioned the figure of 6 million Jews dying in the war.\n\n\u201c6 million? mh\u2026. we all know (or should know) that the counting of Jews is a bit controversial,\u201d Lerro wrote. \u201cThis said, without the death toll of The USSR, we would all speak German now.\u201d\n\nRabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said that comments such as this highlight the anti-Semitism that undergirds the MLA debate and the larger BDS movement.\n\n\u201cHuman rights icon Natan Sharansky spoke of \u2018three Ds\u2019 that should guide us when anti-Israel attack is also anti-Semitic: demonization, delegitimization, or double standard,\u201d said Cooper. \u201cThe anti-peace MLA resolution gets three Ds.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt should surprise no one that such a draconian, one sided initiative that so fundamentally disrespects and demeans Israel, will also inspire overt Jew hatred, including unfortunately, even Holocaust denial,\u201d Cooper told the Washington Free Beacon. \u201cSo much for academic and personal integrity.\u201d\n\nUPDATE 3:03 P.M.: Professor Lerro removed his Facebook post since this article was published. A screen shot of the post was obtained by the Free Beacon.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Professors for BDS slam \u2018Zionist\u2019 control of the media, academia", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "Leaked messages from an internal listserv of university professors involved in the debate surrounding an effort to boycott Israel have revealed a deep bias against the Jewish state and anti-Semitic ac", "title": "Professors Engage in Anti-Semitic Rhetoric on Secret Listserv", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/professors-engage-in-anti-semitic-rhetoric-on-secret-listserv/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Israel-Flags-APP-150x150.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Leaked messages from an internal listserv of university professors involved in the debate surroundin", "creator": "@Kredo0", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Israel-Flags-APP-150x150.png", "title": "Professors Engage in Anti-Semitic Rhetoric on Secret Listserv", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb380\"", "article_summary": "Recent comments found on the internal MLA listserv show that some supporters of the resolution have engaged in what human rights scholars described as anti-Semitic rhetoric.\n\u201cSo much for academic and personal integrity.\u201dUPDATE 3:03 P.M.: Professor Lerro removed his Facebook post since this article was published.\nwe all know (or should know) that the counting of Jews is a bit controversial,\u201d Lerro wrote.\n\u201cIt is time that Zionists are asked to finally account for their support to the illegal occupation of Palestine since 1967,\u201d Lerro wrote.\nLerro is engaging in anti-Semitic hate speech, and it should not be tolerated,\u201d wrote Peter Herman in response to the comment."}
