Dayton\u2019s executive powers do not extend to mandating union elections. Considering that child care providers are independent small business owners, they are not even subject to collective bargaining arrangements.\u201d (Trey Kovacs, the Competitive Enterprise Institute)\n\nIn spite of this, the MN Bureau of Mediation Services sent ballots out February 8 only to independent childcare providers who accept the Child Care Assistance Program. Those who do not are not eligible to vote but the results will impact all providers!\n\n\u201cTo unionize a class of workers, Minnesota\u2019s Labor Relations Act calls for a majority of workers to vote for union representation.\u201d However, \u201cIn the vote to unionize child care providers, the majority of workers are excluded from voting.\u201d (Kovacs)\n\nOut of 11,000 child care providers, fewer than 4,300 are eligible to vote. The executive order is unclear as to whether 6,000-plus child care providers ineligible to vote will be forced to pay their \u201cfair share\u201d dues to the unions.\n\nDayton\u2019s Executive Order describes child care providers as \u201cinvaluable services to working parents and guardians\u2026 particularly well-suited to meet families\u2019 needs, by providing flexible hours and schedules\u2026yet, \u201cUnion contracts do not allow for flexibility. Families have ever-changing schedules that will conflict with union contracts. A likely outcome: an increase of unfair labor practices. Unfair labor practices will lead to increased litigation, escalating child care costs.\u201d (Kovacs)\n\nGovernor Dayton\u2019s executive order will not provide affordable child care. Unions have forced dues payment, loss of worker rights, and restricted entry into markets. It will reduce the number of providers and potential entrepreneurs. \u201cMaintaining worker rights and freedom to choose will afford Minnesotan\u2019s ample quality child care. Unfortunately, Gov. Dayton\u2019s choice will deny widespread access to affordable child care in Minnesota in order to line the pockets of Big Labor.\u201d\n\nLenore Felix, Cold Spring", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width, height=device-height, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Unfair labor practices will lead to increased litigation, escalating child care costs.\u201d (Kovacs)Governor Dayton\u2019s executive order will not provide affordable child care.\nConsidering that child care providers are independent small business owners, they are not even subject to collective bargaining arrangements.\u201d (Trey Kovacs, the Competitive Enterprise Institute)In spite of this, the MN Bureau of Mediation Services sent ballots out February 8 only to independent childcare providers who accept the Child Care Assistance Program.\n\u201cMaintaining worker rights and freedom to choose will afford Minnesotan\u2019s ample quality child care.\nThe executive order is unclear as to whether 6,000-plus child care providers ineligible to vote will be forced to pay their \u201cfair share\u201d dues to the unions.\n\u201cTo unionize a class of workers, Minnesota\u2019s Labor Relations Act calls for a majority of workers to vote for union representation.\u201d However, \u201cIn the vote to unionize child care providers, the majority of workers are excluded from voting.\u201d (Kovacs)Out of 11,000 child care providers, fewer than 4,300 are eligible to vote."}
