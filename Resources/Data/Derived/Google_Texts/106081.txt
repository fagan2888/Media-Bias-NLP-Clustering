For the first time, members of the Embassy of the Philippines stopped by Panama City Sunday

Six members from the embassy stopped by St. John the Evangelist Church in Panama City to offer services to Filipinos from all around the country as part of their Consular Outreach Program.

Some of the services the program offered included issuing passports, dual citizenships, and notarizations.

According to embassy members, one of the reasons they stopped by Panama City is because of the area's growing Filipino population.

"I was told when they were here it started with a few Filipinos, but the number has been growing," Consul Katrina Martin said. "They come from different sectors. Some of them are associated with the base. Others have been in the med-tech industry. Others are in the hospitality industry. So there are various Filipinos from all walks of life here."

Martin said they expected to have about 200 people come out to the program in Panama City.
