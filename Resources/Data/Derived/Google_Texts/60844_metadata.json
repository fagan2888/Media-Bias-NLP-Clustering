Marcos Jr., the son of the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos, said that Filipinos are no longer concerned with abuses committed under his father\u2019s rule, angering human rights activists who say he wants people to forget his father\u2019s strongman rule that a popular revolt ended 29 years ago. (AP Photo/Bullit Marquez) The Associated Press\n\nBy OLIVER TEVES, Associated Press\n\nMANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 The son of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos said Wednesday that Filipinos are no longer concerned about human rights abuses committed under his father's rule, angering activists who said he wants people to forget his father's dictatorship, which a popular revolt ended 29 years ago.\n\nSpeaking to reporters two days after announcing he is seeking the vice presidency in next year's elections, Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. said Filipinos these days are more concerned about their livelihood, crime and other day-to-day problems.\n\nRetired Commission on Human Rights Chairwoman Loretta Ann Rosales, who was tortured and detained under President Marcos, said Marcos Jr., a senator, was glossing over a law passed in 2013 recognizing and compensating victims of human rights abuses during Marcos' 14-year strongman rule.\n\nIn a wide-ranging forum, the 58-year-old senator acknowledged Wednesday that there have been many allegations of human rights violations against his father but that Filipinos \"are not concerned about that\" these days.\n\n\"They are concerned about their lives today,\" he said. \"We want answers. Why are there drugs in our streets? Why is the crime rate going up at an alarming rate? Why is our educational sector miserable? Why is the distribution of wealth not happening? Why is the government not doing anything about it? Why is there no infrastructure development? Why is there no agricultural development? This is what people are worried about.\"\n\nHe said the Marcos name will not be a hindrance to his election campaign.\n\n\"I am the luckiest person that I know, and being a Marcos is part of that,\" he said. \"I have never felt it to be a burden. I have only felt it to be an advantage, a blessing, and I am very thankful that I am a Marcos.\"\n\nPresident Marcos declared nationwide martial law in 1972, a year before his term was to expire. He padlocked Congress, ordered the arrest of political rivals and left-wing activists, and ruled by decree until a \"people power\" revolt drove his family into exile in 1986.\n\nHe denied any wrongdoing, including charges of amassing and hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in Swiss banks, before he died in Hawaii three years later. His widow, Imelda, and their three children were eventually allowed to return home.\n\nA Hawaii court has found the elder Marcos liable for human rights violations and awarded $2 billion from his estate to compensate more than 9,000 Filipinos who filed a lawsuit against him for torture, incarceration, extra-judicial killings and disappearances.\n\nMore than 75,000 Filipinos have filed compensation claims under the law providing reparations for victims of human rights violations, according to the government board reviewing the claims.\n\nMarcos Jr. said he leaves the events of 1986 to historians to judge while he focuses on being a public servant.\n\n\"In my heart of hearts, I truly believe that I was put on this Earth to serve, to be a public servant and that is what I will continue to do until the day that I die,\" he said.\n\nRosales said other laws to protect human rights, such as the Anti-Torture Act and the Anti-Enforced Disappearance Act, were inspired by \"the rich experiences of the people's struggle\" against President Marcos.\n\n\"The mindset (Marcos Jr.) instills among the people is to keep them ignorant of the truth,\" she said. \"It is the height of political arrogance and elitism, so much like his father.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABS-CBN television two months earlier, Marcos Jr. did not directly apologize to the victims of abuses.\n\n\"We have constantly said that if during that time of my father, there were people who were knocked down or who were not provided assistance or they were victimized in some way or another, of course we're sorry that that happened. Nobody wants that to have happened,\" he said.\n\nBonifacio Ilagan, vice chairman of Selda, a group of former political detainees, who was severely tortured by Marcos's military, said \"much of the Marcos regime is still with us,\" alleging human rights are still being violated.\n\nHe said Marcos Jr.'s vice presidential aspiration shows the \"Marcoses' delusion of returning to power to re-establish their brand of anti-people and fascist rule.\"", "article_metadata": {"zone": "world/articles", "keyword": "Associated Press", "title": "Dictator's son says Filipinos care less about Marcos abuses", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 The son of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos said Wednesday that Filipinos are no longer concerned about human rights abuses committed under his father's rule, angering activists who said he wants people to forget his father's dictatorship, which a popular revolt ended 29 years ago.", "title": "Dictator Marcos' son says human rights violations no longer a concern for Filipinos", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/10/07/dictators-son-says-filipinos-care-less-about-marcos-abuses", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/f6/cc0628029fa1f3ee2bd93bd8153691/media:ec8b6c5ff31046b899483e388e091dcbPhilippinesMarcosHumanRights.JPEG", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 The son of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos said Wednesday that Filipinos are no longer concerned about human rights abuses committed under his father's rule, angering activists who said he wants people to forget his father's dictatorship, which a popular revolt ended 29 years ago.", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Dictator's son says Filipinos care less about Marcos abuses"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "Oct. 7, 2015", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Collections: World,Collections: Top News,Associated Press", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) \u2014 The son of late strongman Ferdinand Marcos said Wednesday that Filipinos are no longer concerned about human rights abuses committed under his father's rule, angering activists who said he wants people to forget his father's dictatorship, which a popular revolt ended 29 years ago."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc5fd\"", "article_summary": "In an interview with ABS-CBN television two months earlier, Marcos Jr. did not directly apologize to the victims of abuses.\nMarcos Jr. said he leaves the events of 1986 to historians to judge while he focuses on being a public servant.\n\"The mindset (Marcos Jr.) instills among the people is to keep them ignorant of the truth,\" she said.\nRetired Commission on Human Rights Chairwoman Loretta Ann Rosales, who was tortured and detained under President Marcos, said Marcos Jr., a senator, was glossing over a law passed in 2013 recognizing and compensating victims of human rights abuses during Marcos' 14-year strongman rule.\nMarcos Jr., the son of the late strongman Ferdinand Marcos, said that Filipinos are no longer concerned with abuses committed under his father\u2019s rule, angering human rights activists who say he wants people to forget his father\u2019s strongman rule that a popular revolt ended 29 years ago."}
