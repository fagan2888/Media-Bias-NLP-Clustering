There\u2019s no way that you can reconcile those two statements. I think his June 26, 2015, statement has been the true Obama all along.\n\nPaul Kengor\u2019s \u201cTakedown: From Communists to Progressives, How the Left Has Sabotaged Family and Marriage\u201d is available at the WND Superstore\n\nWND: One of the most significant things you report in \u201cTakedown: From Communists to Progressives, How the Left Has Sabotaged Family and Marriage\u201d is that Obama has supported gay marriage not since 2012, when he first announced his support, but way back in the 1990s. If that\u2019s true, then this would suggest he has lied for many years. Explain this and your sources.\n\nKengor: The main source is an unimpeachable one. It is David Axelrod. Axelrod has known Barack Obama better than any adviser other than perhaps Valerie Jarrett. Axelrod shaped the Obama \u201chope and change\u201d message. He is the man responsible for making Obama president.\n\nAccording to Axelrod, Obama supported gay marriage as far back as the mid-1990s, when he was an aspiring Chicago politician. He publicly suggested otherwise, however, in order to get votes, especially from African-Americans who rejected gay marriage in higher numbers than white Americans.\n\nAccording to Axelrod, in 1996, as a candidate for state senate from left-wing Hyde Park, Obama signed a questionnaire promising his support for legalization of same-sex marriage. \u201cI had no doubt that this was his heartfelt belief,\u201d states Axelrod today. By 2011, adds Axelrod, President Barack Obama was \u201cchamping at the bit to announce his support for the right of gay and lesbian couples to wed.\u201d In May 2012, a year after his Justice Department announced it would not support the Defense of Marriage Act, Obama summoned ABC\u2019s Robin Roberts to the White House to publicly make his support of redefining marriage clear to all of America.\n\nAxelrod\u2019s account is quite remarkable. Even the most liberal Democrats were not supporting gay marriage as far back as 1996. We\u2019ve always known that Obama is a radical leftist, and this would be further proof.\n\nWND: OK, let\u2019s now go deeper than Axelrod, to another figure in your book \u2013 Frank Marshall Davis. If Obama was indeed for same-sex marriage at that point, then was there something earlier in his ideological formation that might have been a factor? Was it Frank Marshall Davis? You\u2019re an expert on Davis. Tell us who he was.\n\nKengor: Frank Marshall Davis (1905-87) was an actual card-carrying member of Communist Party USA, who spent time with a young Barack Obama throughout the 1970s, right up until the moment that Obama left Hawaii for Occidental College in 1979. Davis was very active in party circles. In 1946, he became the founding editor-in-chief of the Chicago Star, the party-line newspaper for Chicago. As we know from his declassified 600-page FBI file (and other sources), his politics were so radical that the FBI had Davis under continued surveillance. More than that, the federal government placed Davis on the Security Index, meaning that in the event of a war between the United States and USSR, Barack Obama\u2019s mentor could be placed under immediate arrest.\n\nBy the way, ironically, David Axelrod had mentors in Chicago who knew Davis in Communist Party circles. For Axelrod, it was the Canter family, which knew and worked with Obama\u2019s mentor in the 1940s. I know that\u2019s wild, but it\u2019s true.\n\nWND: How and when did Obama meet Davis?\n\nKengor: Frank Marshall Davis met a young Obama in the fall of 1970, introduced by Obama\u2019s grandfather, Stanley Dunham, for the purpose of mentoring. An eyewitness, a woman named Dawna Weatherly-Williams, was present the first time Obama and Davis met. She described the relationship as very influential, with Davis impacting Obama on \u201csocial justice,\u201d on \u201clife,\u201d on \u201cwhat\u2019s important,\u201d on no less than \u201chow to use\u201d his \u201cheart\u201d and \u201cmind.\u201d Her account, and Obama\u2019s own, reveals a Davis who affected Obama on social-cultural matters, from attitudes on race and America, to education and women, to much more.\n\nSo deep was the impression that Obama, in his huge bestselling memoir, \u201cDreams from My Father,\u201d would cite \u201cFrank\u201d dozens of times over thousands of words and in each and every section of his memoirs. Obama wrote about drinking whiskey with Davis. Davis would get so drunk he would pass out.\n\nWND: You said you\u2019d prefer not to talk about this, and you avoided the subject in your biography of Davis, but tell us about the many questions regarding Frank Marshall Davis\u2019s sexuality.\n\nKengor: My biography of Davis outlined in great detail his Communist Party work, membership and prodigious propagandizing. It was mainly an intellectual-ideological history of Davis. One aspect of Davis that I barely mentioned, but which others have dug into quite a bit, was his sexually adventurous lifestyle, both during the time he was married to his wife and later after their divorce, when Davis was in his 60s and 70s but was nonetheless vigorous, promiscuous and decidedly non-traditional.\n\nWND: The Internet is rife with scandalous accusations of various sexual escapades and preferences of Davis, including how those choices might have impacted his literal relations with Obama and Obama\u2019s family.\n\nKengor: Absolutely. It\u2019s unavoidable. Some have done articles, books and full-fledged documentaries arguing that Davis is Obama\u2019s real father, a question that I have been asked thousands of times, and which I have always said that I have no conclusive evidence to support. Even more scandalous, some have gone so far as to consider whether Davis had sexual relations with a young Obama, a bold assertion that has been out there for years and which I certainly cannot substantiate. This kind of sensational material is often the first information that pops up in Web searches on Davis and Obama.\n\nWND: Quoting you from your book, \u201cTakedown: From Communists to Progressives, How the Left Has Sabotaged Family and Marriage,\u201d you state that \u201cliberals offended by speculation on Davis\u2019s sordid adventures and how they might relate to Obama need to understand that the thoughts are not totally unjustified. Davis himself is at least partly responsible.\u201d Explain that.\n\nKengor: At the height of the sexual revolution in the late \u201860s, when Davis was in his 60s, the old communist penned a quasi-pornographic novel called \u2018Sex Rebel\u201d under an alias, \u201cBob Greene.\u201d Bob\u2019s sexual exploits, from bisexuality to seducing barely teenage girls \u2013 including a 13-year-old named \u201cAnne,\u201d which, as many have noted, happens to be the name of Obama\u2019s mother \u2013 are revealed frankly and boldly. They are shared without shame; they are boasted about. Davis\u2019s own memoir, \u2018Livin\u2019 the Blues,\u2019 conceded his authorship of \u201cSex Rebel.\u201d He happily admitted that he \u201ccould not truthfully deny that this book \u2026 was mine.\u201d The only question is to what extent the exploits are fictional or non-fictional, desired experiences or actual experiences, partly or fully autobiographical.\n\nWND: In \u201cTakedown,\u201d you cite one expert who notes that in \u201cSex Rebel,\u201d the Davis persona, the narrator, insists that the protagonist\u2019s sexual adventures are all \u201ctaken from actual experiences.\u201d\n\nKengor: Yes, the narrator also concedes that \u201cunder certain circumstances I am bisexual.\u201d The mock introduction to the book, written by an alleged Ph.D. named \u201cDale Gordon,\u201d goes further still, describing the pseudonymous author, Bob Greene, as possessing \u201cstrong homosexual tendencies in his personality.\u201d\n\nWND: You note that the book was conceived, documented, written, published and perhaps lived while Frank Marshall Davis was still married.\n\nKengor: That\u2019s correct. Davis and his wife, Helen, divorced in 1970, after 24 years of marriage and five children together. That marriage was a struggle for years. Helen, too, it should be noted, was a communist, who Davis met at the communist Abraham Lincoln School in Chicago in the 1940s, where he taught and she was a pupil. Helen\u2019s Communist Party USA number was 62109.\n\nWND: You note that Davis\u2019s \u201cSex Rebel\u201d is a graphic and disturbing book and that \u201cit is important to understand that Davis\u2019s sexual life and practices were not unrelated to his communist philosophy.\u201d\n\nKengor: Yes, that\u2019s a consistent theme of \u201cTakedown.\u201d\n\nWND: OK, then here\u2019s the big question, especially in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. So, did Barack Obama, our first gay-marriage president, learn any of these unconventional notions of sex from Frank Marshall Davis?\n\nKengor: The short, honest answer as a historian is that I cannot say. I really can\u2019t. I\u2019m not trying to titillate, or sensationalize, or be unnecessarily provocative, or close the door. I can imagine that Davis might possibly have influenced a more open view toward sexuality by Obama, but it\u2019s unimaginable, I think, that the old communist would have touted gay marriage \u2013 an idea that\u2019s pure madness in any era beyond our own. It\u2019s possible, however, that step one (a more permissive view of unconventional sexuality) could have helped lead Obama to where he now stands on gay marriage.\n\nWND: And what of the many pro-gay policy changes by Obama between the time he knew Davis and June 26, 2015? You lay those out in \u201cTakedown: From Communists to Progressives, How the Left Has Sabotaged Family and Marriage\u201d in your chapter \u201cThe Gay Marriage President.\u201d\n\nKengor: Barack Obama\u2019s pro-gay overtures as president have been unprecedented, and they long precede his 2012 statement to Robin Roberts. We should maybe save that discussion for the next interview.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "In the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision establishing a right to same-sex marriage, WND talked to Paul Kengor, professor of political science at Grove City College in Pennsylvania and author of a new book, Takedown: From Communists to Progressives, How the Left Has Sabotaged Family and Marriage.\u201d WND: Professor Kengor, let\u2019s get right [\u2026]", "title": "How deceitful Obama became \u2018gay marriage president\u2019", "url": "http://mobile.wnd.com/2015/06/how-deceitful-obama-became-gay-marriage-president/", "image": "http://mobile.wnd.com/files/2015/06/obama-gay-marriage-decision.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 152299868169938}, "google-site-verification": "5iw1bKISvQcI1qRwIskRfer6GKV4jUf6LImfS9bhaeI", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1d8c\"", "article_summary": "According to Axelrod, Obama supported gay marriage as far back as the mid-1990s, when he was an aspiring Chicago politician.\nHe publicly suggested otherwise, however, in order to get votes, especially from African-Americans who rejected gay marriage in higher numbers than white Americans.\nSo, did Barack Obama, our first gay-marriage president, learn any of these unconventional notions of sex from Frank Marshall Davis?\nEven the most liberal Democrats were not supporting gay marriage as far back as 1996.\nIt\u2019s possible, however, that step one (a more permissive view of unconventional sexuality) could have helped lead Obama to where he now stands on gay marriage."}
