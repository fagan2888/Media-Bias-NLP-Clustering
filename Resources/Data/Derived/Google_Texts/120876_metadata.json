The central bank stood pat at last week's policy review, after adopting a negative interest rate policy in January.\n\n\"Weak external demand is the major culprit for deterioration in manufacturers' sentiment,\" said Yuichiro Nagai, economist at Barclays Securities.\n\n\"The BOJ tankan will probably show worsening of sentiment at manufacturers and non-manufacturers. We expect the BOJ will ease again in July when it is likely to cut economic and price outlooks. A surprise action cannot be ruled out in April though.\"\n\nThe upcoming BOJ tankan on April 1 is among key indicators the central bank scrutinises when making monetary policy. Expectations linger that it could ease again in coming months to hit its ambitious 2 percent price target.\n\n\"Some of our clients are taking a wait-and-see stance due to yen's rise, stock falls and negative interest rates. While the government's preferential measures for investment end in March, construction is lagging due to labour shortages,\" a machinery producer said in the survey, which companies answer anonymously.\n\nMany manufacturers complained about the slowdown in China and emerging markets, and rises in the yen, which hit a 17-month high below 111 versus the dollar this month.\n\nThe Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers fell to 6 in March from 7 in February, weighed by chemicals, metal products and precision machinery. It is seen at 7 in June.\n\nCompared with three months ago, the manufacturers' index worsened by three points, suggesting the BOJ's tankan may show a deterioration in the big manufacturers' sentiment.\n\nThe service-sector index rose to 24 from 21 in February, led by retailers and information/communications. The index is seen worsening again in the next three months.\n\n(Reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Eric Meijer)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence at Japanese manufacturers eased in March and is seen unli", "title": "Japan manufacturers' mood weighed by yen gains, emerging market slowdown: Reuters Tankan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/22/Japan-manufacturers-mood-weighed-yen-gains-emerging-market-slowdown-Reuters", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/japan-economy-tankan_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/03/22/Japan-manufacturers-mood-weighed-yen-gains-emerging-market-slowdown-Reuters", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/japan-economy-tankan_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "TOKYO (Reuters) - Confidence at Japanese manufacturers eased in March and is seen unli", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b2e\"", "article_summary": "The Reuters Tankan sentiment index for manufacturers fell to 6 in March from 7 in February, weighed by chemicals, metal products and precision machinery.\n\"Weak external demand is the major culprit for deterioration in manufacturers' sentiment,\" said Yuichiro Nagai, economist at Barclays Securities.\nCompared with three months ago, the manufacturers' index worsened by three points, suggesting the BOJ's tankan may show a deterioration in the big manufacturers' sentiment.\nThe upcoming BOJ tankan on April 1 is among key indicators the central bank scrutinises when making monetary policy.\n\"The BOJ tankan will probably show worsening of sentiment at manufacturers and non-manufacturers."}
