Drucker, this plan was developed as an alternative to the House leadership\u2019s shameful attempt to give House Republicans a phony vote to defund Obamacare, while actually handing over the final decision on whether to defund the hated law to Obama\u2019s liberal allies in the Senate.\n\nThis alternative could be part of the government funding bill that must be passed by the end of September or the debt ceiling legislation that will need to be passed a month or so later.\n\nAccording to Drucker\u2019s interview with one Republican who attended the meeting where the plan was floated, House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wis., made a \u201ccompelling case\u201d for using the debt ceiling legislation to negotiate the Obamacare delay, rather than the budget bill favored by Tea Party activists.\n\n\u201cThat is better ground for us to fight on,\u201d said that GOP member reports Drucker.\n\nThe one-year delay proposal advocated by conservative Republican Study Committee members should get some points for creativity, but it has several major flaws that make it unlikely to achieve the desired goal of ending Obamacare\u2019s freedom-killing mandates.\n\nThe first and most troubling flaw is that it exchanges one permanent conservative policy victory \u2013 reducing spending through the sequester \u2013 for a temporary postponement of the implementation of Obamacare.\n\nTrading a permanent something for a temporary anything is almost always a bad idea.\n\nWe understand that you have to give something to get something in a trade, but this is a bad trade that presumes that limiting federal spending is simply one more negotiable provision in a bill, not a principle fundamental to the limited government constitutional conservative philosophy of government.\n\nThe second flaw in the plan floated by the RSC members is that it assumes the battle against Obamacare is a one-off affair and that once the House passes the bill they can go back to naming post offices.\n\nWhile it is true that postponing the implementation of Obamacare for a year gets rid of the immediate discomfort of a potential government shutdown, it doesn\u2019t actually eliminate the Obamacare mandates that outrage grassroots conservative and Tea Party activists.\n\nAny member of Congress who thinks that postponing Obamacare for a year is going to make conservative activists go away or quiet down either didn\u2019t have any August recess town hall meetings or obviously wasn\u2019t listening if they did, because the only thing that is going to satisfy the conservative grassroots is complete elimination of Obamacare\u2019s anti-freedom provisions.\n\nWe give our friends at the RSC credit for creativity with this proposal, but trying to thread the needle between the House GOP leadership\u2019s lack of fight on this (or almost any other issue) and the demands of the conservative grassroots for real action to defund Obamacare is an enterprise destined to fail.\n\nTo find the best ground upon which to fight Obamacare, House Republicans, particularly the leadership, need to get their heads around the truth that there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that demands Republicans fund programs with which they disagree.\n\nIn fact, the Constitution contemplates that Congress, particularly the House, will act as a break on an overambitious executive branch.\n\nThat\u2019s the first and best ground upon which House conservatives should fight Obamacare and the rest of President Obama\u2019s radical secular liberal agenda.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "ConservativeHQ.com", "title": "The Best Ground to Fight Obamacare On"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe194e\"", "article_summary": "That\u2019s the first and best ground upon which House conservatives should fight Obamacare and the rest of President Obama\u2019s radical secular liberal agenda.\nTo find the best ground upon which to fight Obamacare, House Republicans, particularly the leadership, need to get their heads around the truth that there\u2019s nothing in the Constitution that demands Republicans fund programs with which they disagree.\nWhile the Capitol Hill Republican \u201cleadership\u201d is desperate to avoid a fight on Obamacare, conservatives are debating where the best ground is for the fight to block implementation of Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, abortion requirement and other freedom-stealing provisions.\n\u201cThat is better ground for us to fight on,\u201d said that GOP member reports Drucker.\nThe first and most troubling flaw is that it exchanges one permanent conservative policy victory \u2013 reducing spending through the sequester \u2013 for a temporary postponement of the implementation of Obamacare."}
