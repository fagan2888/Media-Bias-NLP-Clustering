Now a replacement proposal that would extend the breaks for two years is running into fire as well.\n\nThe tax breaks -- known as \u201cextenders\u201d because of lawmakers\u2019 habit of extending them every year or two rather than allowing them to expire or making them permanent -- have become the focus of regular fights between champions of special interests on Capitol Hill and those concerned about the growth of the federal debt.\n\nRelated: 14 Outrageous Tax Deductions the IRS Denied\n\nA proposal last month to make a number of the tax breaks permanent, including the research and experimentation tax credit beloved in the business community, ran into trouble when it became clear that the entire $700 million cost, plus an estimated $150 million in interest, would be added to the national debt.\n\nHowever, while it may have a lower price tag, the replacement proposal, which would extend many of the breaks for two years \u2013 also without paying for them \u2013 is in some ways even more generous to its beneficiaries.\n\nAccording to the Center for a Responsible Federal Budget, \u201cthe legislation introduced in the House, despite its lower price tag, would still be fiscally irresponsible \u2013 not only because it would add to the debt without offsets but because it would actually expand a number of tax breaks beyond their traditional cost.\n\n\u201cThe expansions include making the research credit more generous \u2013 increasing its costs by 40 percent \u2013 increasing and expanding bonus depreciation, and indexing thresholds for Section 179 expensing, among others. The expansion of bonus depreciation moves in the opposite direction of the big deal being discussed which would phase out bonus depreciation over five years. The bill also includes a few new policies, such as legislation expanding 529 accounts considered earlier this year.\u201d\n\nThe latest plan for the extenders package was to bundle it together with the massive omnibus appropriations bill that Congress has to muscle through in order to fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year.\n\nRelated: Lawmakers Press to Strike a Fatal Blow to the \u2018Cadillac Tax\u2019 on Healthcare Plans\n\nHowever, the omnibus is expected to need Democratic support to clear the fractious House of Representatives, and on Friday, Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) said that if the extenders package gets attached to it, that help won\u2019t be forthcoming.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see very much support on the Democratic side for the tax extender bill,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cIt includes hundreds of billions of dollars in permanent tax breaks for special interests and big corporations while neglecting hard-working families.\u201d\n\nThe one thing that looks certain about the extenders package right now is the uncertainty of its fate, as next week shapes up to be one filled with particularly complex legislative maneuvering.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Opposition to a $700 million plan to", "title": "Why Congress Wants Sweeter Tax Breaks for Special Interests", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/12/Why-Congress-Wants-Sweeter-Tax-Breaks-Special-Interests", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252013_Ominous_Capitol.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/12/Why-Congress-Wants-Sweeter-Tax-Breaks-Special-Interests", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/09252013_Ominous_Capitol.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@rrgarver"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Opposition to a $700 million plan to", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The expansion of bonus depreciation moves in the opposite direction of the big deal being discussed which would phase out bonus depreciation over five years.\nOpposition to a $700 million plan to renew several expired tax breaks and make them permanent stirred enough anger among budget-conscious lawmakers and outside groups to persuade Congress to back away from the idea.\n\u201cThe expansions include making the research credit more generous \u2013 increasing its costs by 40 percent \u2013 increasing and expanding bonus depreciation, and indexing thresholds for Section 179 expensing, among others.\nNow a replacement proposal that would extend the breaks for two years is running into fire as well.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see very much support on the Democratic side for the tax extender bill,\u201d Pelosi said."}
