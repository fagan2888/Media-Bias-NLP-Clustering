Other factors do matter, like how old the car is and whether or not it has added safety features, but color doesn't matter. If a red car will make you happy, go ahead and buy it.\n\nRenter's Insurance\n\nMyth: Your landlord's insurance will cover your stuff if something happens to the building.\n\nYour landlord has building insurance, but the coverage does not extend to replacing your stuff. That's your responsibility. Don't expect someone else to pick up the tab if your property is ruined or stolen.
