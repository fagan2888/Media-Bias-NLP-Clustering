The New York Times has a predictably biased piece on that subject this weekend, but it does cover some of the particulars in how that state, and Kansas, are choosing to proceed.\n\nBarred by the Supreme Court from requiring proof of citizenship for federal elections, Arizona is complying \u2014 but setting up a separate registration system for local and state elections that will demand such proof. The state this week joined Kansas in planning for such a two-tiered voting system, which could keep thousands of people from participating in state and local elections, including next year\u2019s critical cycle, when top posts in both states will be on the ballot. The states are using an opening left in June by the United States Supreme Court when it said that the power of Congress over federal elections was paramount but did not rule on proof of citizenship in state elections. Such proof was required under Arizona\u2019s Proposition 200, which passed in 2004 and is one of the weapons in the border state\u2019s arsenal of laws enacted in its battle against illegal immigration.\n\nThis sounds to me like it\u2019s certainly doable, but it\u2019s going to be complicated. What does the process look like on election day when voters show up at the polls? Assuming you arrive with no valid ID which qualifies under the law, you can\u2019t vote in the state and local races, but you have to be allowed to vote in a national election. But in every state where I\u2019ve lived, there\u2019s only one ballot set up for the voter to use. Would this require, for example, a 2016 ballot which is broken into two pieces, one for the national races only and a second one with all the choices? The article indicates that\u2019s precisely what they\u2019ll need to do.\n\nThe two-tiered system \u2014 deemed costly, cumbersome and prone to confusion by many of its opponents, as well as election officials in both states \u2014 threatens to derail an effort by Democrats and their allies to increase voter registration and turnout among Latinos and the poor, part of a push by the party to pick up local offices and seats in the states\u2019 legislatures, where policies have been largely dictated by Republicans in recent years. The states would create separate ballots covering only federal races for voters who do not provide proof of citizenship\u2026 On Monday, Mr. Horne instructed county election officials to create separate rolls for voters who signed up using the federal form and those who used the state form, the first step to determining eligibility. In Maricopa County, Arizona\u2019s largest, the exercise turned up 900 people who did not show proof of citizenship, a small fraction of the roughly 1.9 million county residents registered.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear to me precisely how much this would \u201cdrive up costs\u201d beyond the baseline issue of printing for locations using paper ballots. If you\u2019re using a computer based system, it would seem that you\u2019d solve the problem through software and any additional costs incurred would just come in initial application development. Either way, a lot of states will be watching closely to see how this works and what bugs need to be ironed out of the system. If it functions as intended and doesn\u2019t run into any more court challenge issues, there are plenty of other states which may choose to follow this path.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Exceptions", "title": "Two tier voting systems in two states", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/10/13/two-tier-voting-systems-in-two-states/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-13T21:01:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-13T17:42:05+00:00"}, "keywords": "2014 election, Arizona, Kansas, voting, voting rights,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "The states are using an opening left in June by the United States Supreme Court when it said that the power of Congress over federal elections was paramount but did not rule on proof of citizenship in state elections.\nBarred by the Supreme Court from requiring proof of citizenship for federal elections, Arizona is complying \u2014 but setting up a separate registration system for local and state elections that will demand such proof.\nIf it functions as intended and doesn\u2019t run into any more court challenge issues, there are plenty of other states which may choose to follow this path.\nEither way, a lot of states will be watching closely to see how this works and what bugs need to be ironed out of the system.\nThe state this week joined Kansas in planning for such a two-tiered voting system, which could keep thousands of people from participating in state and local elections, including next year\u2019s critical cycle, when top posts in both states will be on the ballot."}
