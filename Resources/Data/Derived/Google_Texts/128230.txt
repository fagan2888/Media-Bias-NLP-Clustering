The last disaster recovery center for victims of North Texas’ late December tornadoes will close this afternoon, marking a transition from emergency relief to long-term recovery.

The center, located at Granger Recreation Center in Garland, will be open until 3 p.m. Sunday. Residents can meet with caseworkers or pick up food items, clothes or other donated items.

The last of six Red Cross shelters, located in Garland at Gale Recreation Center, closed Friday, Red Cross spokeswoman Anita Foster said. The shelters offered temporary housing and food for people affected by the storms.

Foster said the closure of shelters and recovery centers represents a shift to long-term rebuilding. “It’s the end of one phase and the entrance into another,” she said.

In the days after the tornadoes, Red Cross staff and volunteers drove mobile trucks into hard-hit neighborhoods with hot meals and water. They provided 13 days of temporary housing, distributed about 20,000 meals and gave out about 25,000 shovels, trash bags and rakes for clean-up, Foster said. About 250 people spent at least one night in one of the shelters, she said.

Now, case workers are helping families find permanent housing. They have helped people look for an apartment, verify their identity for a landlord and file for insurance reimbursements.

If tornado victims still need assistance, they can call the Red Cross at 1-800-733-2767. Volunteers for the recovery effort can sign up at 1-866-505-4801 or visit the local Red Cross Chapter at 4800 Harry Hines in Dallas.

Tornado victims can also receive financial assistance for housing from the Texas Association of Realtors Relief Fund by calling 1-800-873-9155.
