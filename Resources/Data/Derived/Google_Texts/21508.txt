One person is dead after a single-vehicle accident in Shelby County Saturday night.

It happened just after 10 p.m. Saturday in the 800 Block of Fisherville Road.

Shelby County officials say the driver was partially ejected from his automobile after he ran off the road and flipped several times before finally resting on the passenger side.

No seat belts appear to have been worn, and alcohol or drugs do not appear to be factors.
