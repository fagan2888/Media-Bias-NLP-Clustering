Some who bought health plans from Blue Shield of California have sued Blue Shield saying they were duped into believing they would have more choices in doctors and hospitals, Reuters reported.

The suit was filed last week in California state court. It is not connected to the ongoing antitrust lawsuit emanating from Alabama against numerous Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans across the country.

In the California case, San Francisco residents John Harrington and Alex Talon said Blue Shield misrepresented their plans saying the plans sold on the states exchange set up under the Affordable Care Act would cover a full provider network, Reuters reported. The class action suits says a group of buyers bought plans thinking their doctors and hospitals were covered but were not.

A Blue Shield spokesman said the company is reviewing the suit.

"We take these charges seriously, and believe enrollees should be as informed as possible about the products they select," the spokesman said.

One recent report found the cost of insurance premiums on the exchanges to be less expensive, slightly, than those bought through employers. Business Insider reported some of those savings come from exchange plans' "narrower networks" -- meaning fewer doctors and hospitals to choose from.

The unrelated Alabama class action suit, filed in federal court in Birmingham, alleges that about three dozen Blue Cross organizations have violated antitrust laws by orchestrating a "complete lack of meaningful competition" within markets across the United States where Blue Cross businesses sell insurance.

Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association in Chicago, speaking for the independently owned Blue Cross businesses, says the antitrust lawsuit has no merit.
