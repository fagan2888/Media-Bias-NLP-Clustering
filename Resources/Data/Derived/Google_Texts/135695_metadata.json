Wicker Paradise, CC BY 2.0\n\nThe newest exercise fad can't be found in gyms, but only in offices. Greater numbers of working people are eschewing traditional office chairs for treadmills, cycling, and exercise balls while staring at spreadsheets or taking conference calls.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a glob of information that sitting is killing us,\u201d James Levine, an endocrinologist with the Mayo Clinic, told USA Today. \u201cYou\u2019re basically sitting yourself into a coffin.\u201d\n\nStudies have shown that too much sitting can increase the risk of death from cardiovascular disease or cancer, according to the Mayo Clinic. One of them found that people who sat for four hours a day in front of a TV or other screen \u2014 including a work computer \u2014 were 50 percent more likely to die from any cause and almost 125 percent more likely to experience events related to cardiovascular disease, such as chest pain, when compared to people who sat for less than two hours a day. What\u2019s more, other research suggests that people who sit for longer periods may not benefit from any exercise they\u2019re getting.\n\nNow, people like Andrew Lockerbie, senior vice president of benefits at Brown & Brown, a global insurance consulting firm, are walking on treadmills while they work. He walks up to four miles on any given day, burning about 350 calories, on a treadmill desk that his company bought. By doing so, he tells USA Today, he\u2019s able to be \u201cproductive on two fronts.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in meetings and at my desk and on the phone all day,\u201d he told USA Today. \u201cIt\u2019s great to be able to have an option at my work to get some physical activity while I\u2019m actually doing office stuff. You feel better, you get your blood moving, you think clearly.\u201d\n\nLockerbie\u2019s treadmill, and others made for working, typically move at about one to two miles per hour \u2014 just enough speed to improve metabolic rate and blood sugar levels, Levine says.\n\nManufacturers of treadmill desks have seen sales growths recently too. LifeSpan Fitness, a treadmill desk manufacturer based in Salt Lake City, saw sales triple in 2012. Indianapolis-based TreadDesk forecasts a 25 percent increase in sales, since major companies, such as Microsoft, Procter and Gamble, and Coca-Cola have started buying large quantities of the desks.\n\nOther workers use large rubber exercise balls for sitting. \u201cI\u2019ve got nurses in my operating room who will use one of those balls instead of a chair,\u201d Michael Maloney, a professor of orthopedics and sports medicine specialist at the University of Rochester Medical Center, told USA Today. Rather than sitting in one position all day, exercise balls force people to exercise their abdominal, back, and pelvic muscles.\n\nFor people who aren\u2019t able to exercise while they work, doctors recommend taking short breaks to walk around or stretch, which could be just enough to wake muscles up and increase blood flow. If even that\u2019s not possible, simply standing up could be effective too.\n\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re of your bottom, it\u2019s inevitable that you start meandering around,\u201d Levine told USA Today. \u201cWithin two minutes of standing, one [metabolic process] activates a series of metabolic processes that are beneficial. Once you sit, all of those things get switched off.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "exercise work, desk treadmill, exercise ball, cycle desk, sitting, office", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "As companies begin to realize that sitting for long periods of time can offset the benefits of exercise, more are buying treadmill and cycle desks, or encouraging employees to use exercise balls rather than chairs.", "title": "Get Moving While You Work: Desk Treadmills, Office Cycles, And Exercise Balls Grow In Popularity", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/get-moving-while-you-work-desk-treadmills-office-cycles-and-exercise-balls-grow-popularity-256818", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/15/treadmill-desk.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "As companies begin to realize that sitting for long periods of time can offset the benefits of exercise, more are buying treadmill and cycle desks, or encouraging employees to use exercise balls rather than chairs.", "title": "Get Moving While You Work: Desk Treadmills, Office Cycles, And Exercise Balls Grow In Popularity", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/get-moving-while-you-work-desk-treadmills-office-cycles-and-exercise-balls-grow-popularity-256818", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/15/treadmill-desk.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/09/15/treadmill-desk.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2013-09-15T15:57:45-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-15T17:39:18-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "As companies begin to realize that sitting for long periods of time can offset the benefits of exercise, more are buying treadmill and cycle desks, or encouraging employees to use exercise balls rather than chairs."}, "article_summary": "Greater numbers of working people are eschewing traditional office chairs for treadmills, cycling, and exercise balls while staring at spreadsheets or taking conference calls.\nRather than sitting in one position all day, exercise balls force people to exercise their abdominal, back, and pelvic muscles.\n\u201cOnce you\u2019re of your bottom, it\u2019s inevitable that you start meandering around,\u201d Levine told USA Today.\nBy doing so, he tells USA Today, he\u2019s able to be \u201cproductive on two fronts.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in meetings and at my desk and on the phone all day,\u201d he told USA Today.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a glob of information that sitting is killing us,\u201d James Levine, an endocrinologist with the Mayo Clinic, told USA Today."}
