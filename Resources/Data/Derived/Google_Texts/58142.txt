The Church of the Mediator held a special concert Sunday afternoon that featured a world famous musician.

Dr. John Paul is a world renowned harpsichord player and this afternoon entertained the crowd through some music. This concert is one of four that the Church of the Mediator put on to raise money for their new organ. Rector Helen Tester says it's this series of music that they wanted to feature during the concert series.

"We just think music is sort of like prayer," Rector Tester said. "It gets into your soul and good music enables you to rejoice and to celebrate God and all God's gifts to us."

The Church of the Mediator will hold a final concert in May.
