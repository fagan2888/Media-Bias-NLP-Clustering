Since arriving in the U.S. illegally 12 years ago, she has taken her two youngest children to the doctor only for required school physicals and relied on home remedies for everything else.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that we really need insurance,\u201d the 46-year-old Anaheim resident said. \u201cFor the children, it will be a big help.\u201d\n\nThe coverage under Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid, is expected to result in more preventive care and better long-term health for an estimated 170,000 children who have long relied on safety-net clinics and emergency rooms. But while many policymakers, advocates and researchers celebrated the budget deal announced by Gov. Jerry Brown last month, they also said the new coverage is limited because it doesn\u2019t guarantee access to doctors and doesn\u2019t include adults.\n\n\u201cThis is an important investment,\u201d said Claire D. Brindis, director of the University of California San Francisco\u2019s Institute for Health Policy Studies. \u201cBut it is not the full solution.\u201d\n\nAbout 1.16 million low-income adults are in California illegally and ineligible for comprehensive Medi-Cal services, though they may qualify for pregnancy and emergency care. In many areas of the state, they can get county-based coverage, but it also is not comprehensive and can\u2019t be used in other counties.\n\nOrange County doesn\u2019t offer such coverage. Ortiz wishes the state would allow her and her oldest son to sign up for Medi-Cal too. He is 22 and has heart problems that have landed him in the emergency room about three times a year. She has to pay out-of-pocket for his regular visits to a cardiologist.\n\nState Sen. Ricardo Lara, a Democrat from Bell Gardens, has proposed legislation that could extend Medi-Cal to low-income adults living in the state illegally, depending on available funding. The bill also requests a waiver from the federal government enabling higher-income immigrants to buy unsubsidized insurance through the state\u2019s insurance marketplace.\n\nIn the meantime, Aracely Patchett, an administrator at Central City Community Health Center in Anaheim, where Ortiz gets care, said the new health coverage will enable her staff to refer the children to specialists. \u201cNot being able to provide the care they deserve has been frustrating,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd Carmela Castellano-Garcia, president of the California Primary Care Association, said having the children covered will boost community health centers\u2019 bottom line because many centers until now have been serving this population at a loss.\n\n\u201cThese victories just fuel the fire continuing forward,\u201d she said. \u201cThese incremental steps are very critical.\u201d\n\nHealth researcher Laurel Lucia said she isn\u2019t surprised that the state decided, for now, to cover children because there are fewer of them than adults and they are less costly. In addition, providing them with preventive care is a good long-term investment for the state, said Lucia, health care program manager at the University of California Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education.\n\nAlso, Lucia said, \u201cthere is more sympathy toward kids.\u201d\n\nThe children\u2019s insurance will only help health and immigration advocates in their continued fight to include everyone in health insurance, said Wendy Lazarus, co-president of The Children\u2019s Partnership, a nonprofit child advocacy organization.\n\n\u201cIt is a hugely important step forward for the state and something we can build on,\u201d she said. \u201cMomentum is really building in California to finish the job and cover all residents, regardless of age.\u201d\n\nOpponents said California shouldn't force its citizens to pay for health care for people here illegally.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about transferring tens of millions of dollars from taxpayers \u2013 citizens and lawful permanent residents \u2013 to those who have flouted our nation\u2019s immigration laws and are now laying claim to the property of others,\u201d said John C. Eastman, a law professor at Chapman University in Orange.\n\nEastman said the magnet for illegal immigration was already large enough in California. \u201cGovernor Brown and the Democrats in the State Legislature have now made that magnet even larger,\u201d he said.\n\nThe children will enter a Medi-Cal system that has more than 12 million enrollees and is already struggling to ensure access to care. About 2.3 million people have joined the Medi-Cal rolls since the beginning of 2014, when the Affordable Care Act took full effect. About half the children in the state are now on Medi-Cal.\n\nThe California State Auditor recently found that the state had failed to ensure that Californians in Medi-Cal managed care could find doctors. And last year, the auditors said that only half of children enrolled in Medi-Cal were receiving dental care. Their audit cited insufficient numbers of dentists in some areas due to low reimbursement rates.\n\nMeanwhile, because immigrants living here illegally have long been excluded from coverage, getting them to sign up won\u2019t necessarily be easy.\n\n\u201cWe have a big challenge ahead of us to dispel the perception that undocumented people are forever left out,\u201d said Daniel Zingale, senior vice president at The California Endowment, which has invested heavily in the campaign dubbed \u201cHealth for All\u201d to cover all immigrants.\n\nZingale said community clinics, faith-based groups and the ethnic media will likely play a big role in educating families about the new coverage.\n\nExperience has shown that even when immigrants living here illegally qualify for coverage, they may not apply. UC researchers found that many adults under 30 who were granted temporary legal status and became eligible for Medi-Cal were still likely to remain uninsured. That\u2019s because they weren\u2019t aware of their eligibility or were worried about the effect on relatives in the country without legal permission.\n\nJacqueline Curiel, a Santa Ana-based administrator for the AltaMed Health Services Corp. Community Health Center, said many people fear that enrolling their children in public programs could hurt the family\u2019s chances of getting legal status. She said her staff has a tough job assuring patients that it won\u2019t affect their immigration cases.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of distrust,\u201d Curiel said.\n\nCuriel said she is hopeful that the parents will soon be eligible for comprehensive Medi-Cal. But even if California\u2019s policymakers don\u2019t opt to cover adults, immigrant families are better off than in the past.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made large strides,\u201d she said.\n\nAnna Gorman is a writer with Kaiser Health News, an editorially independent program of the Henry J.
