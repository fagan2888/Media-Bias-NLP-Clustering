Aside from being an inspiring and legendary figure in Columbia\u2019s history department, Foner has penned over twenty books, and won a Pulitzer Prize, a Lincoln Prize, and a Bancroft prize. In 2000, Foner was elected president of the American Historical Association, and today remains the foremost contemporary historian on the Reconstruction Period. LIV LANSDALE sat down with Foner for a once-in-a-lifetime conversation.\n\nIs history being put to any new uses?\n\nHistory is a wonderful subject because it\u2019s totally democratic. Everybody thinks that he or she can say something about history\u2014as opposed to physics, say, or some highly technical field like that. I think that\u2019s great, but people in Hollywood think that if you read a book of history you\u2019re a historian, and then you can say whatever you feel like in a movie. Historical analogies are also bandied about by political leaders, often imperfectly. [Ben Carson] recently said \u201cObamacare\u201d is the worst thing to happen since slavery, and some conservative politician ran with that. Or think of the Munich analogy: If we do this or that, then we\u2019ll appease the enemy, and that\u2019s bad because a similar thing led to World War II. These kinds of things are often very misleading when applied to the current world. I\u2019m afraid the job of the historian often is to be a killjoy; to say \u201cNo, no, what you\u2019re saying doesn\u2019t make much sense.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of Munich, I enjoyed reading your reaction to Tony Kushner\u2019s Lincoln. What would you say is the most damaging myth in America today? What\u2019s the one historical fact you\u2019d want everyone in the country to accept?\n\nI doubt very strongly if we would get everybody to agree because the essence of studying history is debate and change in interpretation. But, I would say the most pernicious idea about history that is widely shared here is the idea of American exceptionalism: That our history is so different from that of every other country that we don\u2019t have to know anything about anybody else. With that comes, \u201cWe are better than everybody else. We have a unique mission in the world.\u201d In a way it alerts us to issues of liberty and human rights around the world\u2014but in a globalized, interconnected world, that notion of exceptionalism has little real validity. It leads to parochialism, self-satisfaction, and a lack of interest in the rest of the world. If I had one idea I\u2019d like everyone to abandon, it\u2019s American exceptionalism, that we are exempt from the processes of history that affect everybody else. That we have a superior position in the world that gives us the right to tell other countries what they ought to do without listening to an international dialogue.\n\nIn your career, have you noticed any trends in the way history is taught?\n\nI think, unfortunately, the biggest trend right now is the decline of the teaching of history. In many schools\u2014both high school and pre-high school\u2014the entire emphasis of the Barack Obama administration and many others on high stakes testing, particularly of English and Math, makes history kind of a luxury. At Dalton School (The Dalton School) or Stuyvesant (Stuyvesant High School) or places like that, it is extensively taught. But at schools with more challenged groups of students, history is a luxury they can\u2019t afford. Their budget depends on Math and English test scores. If history is not being taught, academic trends are irrelevant.\n\nSounds like the arts to me.\n\nThe arts are also being eliminated for the same reasons. I admire President Obama, but I think his educational policy is a disaster. This emphasis on vocational training, that you must train people for a job. They have proposed ranking colleges on the basis of the income of graduates.\n\nI spoke to someone who works at the White House about this recently. I said, \u201cWhat do you think that\u2019s going to do to the rankings of women\u2019s colleges? Since women earn less than men?\u201d I\u2019m sorry to say, but that\u2019s a fact of our economic system. They said, \u201cOh, we didn\u2019t even think of that.\u201d They don\u2019t think up there, unfortunately, about a lot of things when it comes to education policy.\n\nDo you risk professional credibility, the more your writing tends toward narrative?\n\nOne would hope not. I believe in narrative. We ought to be alert to how we\u2019re communicating our ideas, to the need to make our work accessible. Hofstadter was a brilliant stylist, and that got him a much bigger audience than he would have gotten otherwise. So when I teach graduate courses in history, I emphasize the writing of it. To go back to your point, I gave a lecture a few years ago at a conference about the historical novel. It was mostly literary types. I said, \u201cWe are not as different from you as you might think.\u201d Historical narrative is an act of creation. What, after all, determines the choice of facts? There is an infinite array. The historian creates history by choosing what to leave in and what to leave out of a narrative. People aren\u2019t making things up; they\u2019re just making different choices about what to include in their historical narrative and what to omit. So it\u2019s literary in that it\u2019s an act of the imagination. I\u2019ve always felt that we have history in the wrong division here at Columbia\u2014it\u2019s in the division of social sciences. We should be in the humanities.\n\nHow do you monitor yourself for open-mindedness?\n\nIt\u2019s what happens when you encounter surprises. That\u2019s what being a professional historian means, that quality of mind that allows you to take into account things you didn\u2019t expect. It\u2019s a product of training. Even if you don\u2019t do that, that\u2019s what the professional standards are for; other historians hold you to them.\n\nHere\u2019s an example. For at least 10 years of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s life, he advocated what they called at that time \u201ccolonization,\u201d encouraging black people to leave the United States for some other place. He gave speeches and made statements. Many books on Lincoln don\u2019t talk about this at all, or they\u2019ll just throw in a sentence. Many researchers on Lincoln are so invested in the idea of the \u201cGreat Emancipator\u201d that they don\u2019t want to discuss anything that may undercut that image you already had.\n\nI thought of Ray Bradbury\u2019s \u201cDownwind from Gettysburg\u201d when I read about your role in the \u201cMeet Mr. Lincoln\u201d display at Disneyland. Have there been any stranger-than-fiction moments in your career?\n\nActual history is often stranger than fiction. Certainly working with the Disney Corporation had some strange moments.\n\nBut working with them I also learned how little I know about many things. When I was down at Orlando, Fla. giving some advice, they showed me a movie about to be released. I said, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think this is really going to get anywhere.\u201d It was The Lion King. I mean, are people really going to care about a king among the lions? Why don\u2019t they have a democratic government? I guess I didn\u2019t really have my finger on the popular pulse that day.\n\nThe phrase \u201canimal kingdom\u201d must be pretty embedded in American culture.\n\nMaybe. A sequel could show a revolution, just as we overthrew the king in 1776. Luckily, Disney didn\u2019t listen to my advice.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://columbiaspectator.com/eye/2014/02/06/national-treasure", "site_name": "Columbia Daily Spectator", "image": "http://columbiaspectator.com/sites/default/files/ericinterview.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "National Treasure"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/columbiaspectator"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ColumbiaSpec", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 355995844518826}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9051\"", "article_summary": "I said, \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t think this is really going to get anywhere.\u201d It was The Lion King.\nI said, \u201cWe are not as different from you as you might think.\u201d Historical narrative is an act of creation.\nMany books on Lincoln don\u2019t talk about this at all, or they\u2019ll just throw in a sentence.\nI said, \u201cWhat do you think that\u2019s going to do to the rankings of women\u2019s colleges?\nThey said, \u201cOh, we didn\u2019t even think of that.\u201d They don\u2019t think up there, unfortunately, about a lot of things when it comes to education policy."}
