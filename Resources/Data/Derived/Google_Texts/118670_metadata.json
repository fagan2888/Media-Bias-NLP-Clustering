He was 58.\n\n\u201cBruce\u2019s humanity is on every frame of the films that he leaves behind, and words can\u2019t express how graced I feel my life has been by having the extraordinary opportunity of being able to say we were partners and, more importantly, best friends,\u201d said Berlinger.\n\nThe duo collaborated on Sinofsky\u2019s debut, the critically acclaimed \u201cBrother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d before turning to the \u201cParadise Lost\u201d trilogy, a series of films that drew attention to the case of three teen boys convicted in 1994 of killing three Cub Scouts in West Memphis, Arkansas.\n\nThe films, released in 1996, 2004 and 2011, raised questions about the evidence, drawing attention from musicians including Eddie Vedder, Tom Waits and Henry Rollins, who pushed for a review of the case. After spending 18 years in prison, Jessie Misskelley, Damien Echols and Jason Baldwin were released pursuant to a complicated plea agreement in September 2011, one month before the final installment, \u201cPurgatory,\u201d was released.\n\nThe film was nominated for an Academy Award.\n\nAs the case wended though the courts, Sinokfsky and Berlinger turned their attention to metal band Metallica, whose music was featured in the first two installments of \u201cParadise Lost.\u201d The result was 2004\u2019s \u201cMetallica: Some Kind of Monster.\u201d\n\nSinofsky also directed PBS\u2019 \u201cGood Rockin\u2019 Tonight: The Legacy of Sun Records,\u201d an installment of The History Channel\u2019s \u201c10 Days that Unexpectedly Changed America\u201d and episodes of the Sundance Channel\u2019s \u201cIconoclasts\u201d series. He won multiple Emmys, a Peabody and an Independent Spirit Award for his work.\n\nBerlinger recalled Sinofsky\u2019s dedication to his first film \u201cBrother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d despite a lack of of financial backing or equipment.\n\n\u201cBruce encouraged both of us to throw caution into the wind to start capturing what would become \u2018Brother\u2019s Keeper\u2019 in 1991 with no money in our pockets, in the pre-video 16mm age of documentary-making, when making a no-budget film took a little more ingenuity to get in the can,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\n\u201cHis unique combination of courage and empathy made that possible, as well as everything that came after for us. The extraordinary adventures we had on the road and the deeply stimulating experiences we had in the editing room were life-changing for all of us who knew him thanks to his wisdom and fervor to change the world. \u201d\n\nA memorial service will be held in March.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oscar-nominated filmmaker Bruce Sinofsky, whose series on the \"West Memphis Three\" cast doubt on the murder convictions of three Arkansas teenagers, catalyzing a movement that led to their release, died Saturday, longtime collaborator Joe Berlinger said.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "5873d9988d745234e5abf9cff7ed939d"}, "og": {"site_name": "FOX31 Denver", "description": "Oscar-nominated filmmaker Bruce Sinofsky, whose series on the \u201cWest Memphis Three\u201d cast doubt on the murder convictions of three Arkansas teenagers, catalyzing a movement that led to th\u2026", "title": "Director Bruce Sinofsky of \u2018Paradise Lost\u2019 trilogy dies", "url": "http://kdvr.com/2015/02/21/director-bruce-sinofsky-of-paradise-lost-trilogy-dies/", "image": {"width": 770, "identifier": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/150221150058-bruce-sinofsky-tablet-large.jpg", "height": 433}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/150221150058-bruce-sinofsky-tablet-large.jpg?w=640"}, "site": "@kdvr", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kdvr"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "Denver, Colorado News, Weather, Sports and more", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=334627011", "fb": {"pages": 90018331599}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://kdvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/17e52d5bd05a36821dc7d1d5f90e105c?s=16", "application-name": "FOX31 Denver", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver", "published_time": "2015-02-22T01:49:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-22T01:49:09+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver"}, "keywords": "national/world news, bruce sinofsky, oscars", "google-site-verification": "AmrqnQj74ngNWI1vn6WwMZyy9IWy4ZqooGuxLtd7lIs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd374f\"", "article_summary": "Berlinger recalled Sinofsky\u2019s dedication to his first film \u201cBrother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d despite a lack of of financial backing or equipment.\nThe Emmy-award winning documentary director died in his sleep of complications from diabetes, Berlinger said.\n\u201cHis unique combination of courage and empathy made that possible, as well as everything that came after for us.\nOscar-nominated filmmaker Bruce Sinofsky, whose series on the \u201cWest Memphis Three\u201d cast doubt on the murder convictions of three Arkansas teenagers, catalyzing a movement that led to their release, died Saturday, longtime collaborator Joe Berlinger said.\nThe duo collaborated on Sinofsky\u2019s debut, the critically acclaimed \u201cBrother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d before turning to the \u201cParadise Lost\u201d trilogy, a series of films that drew attention to the case of three teen boys convicted in 1994 of killing three Cub Scouts in West Memphis, Arkansas."}
