But according to Cliff Kincaid of the right-wing dinosaur media watchdog, the ironically named Accuracy in Media, the Las Vegas shooters, Jerad Miller and his wife, Amanda, were somehow left\u2013wing radicals who shot police officers as some sort of a protest against marijuana prohibition.\n\nKincaid\u2019s piece is in response to an article by Jon Avlon in the Daily Beast in which Avlon lays out all the ways in which the Millers were influenced by far-right militia and white supremacy rhetoric. The list is substantial. But Kincaid notices something amiss. You see, Avlon fails to note that Miller was a pot smoker who was also angry at the government for jailing him on drug charges. And that\u2019s true, at least in part. Miller\u2019s hatred for government was informed by his brush with the law on drug charges. But Kincaid fails to note that what seemed to really bother him about that was the fact that his felony conviction made it impossible for him to legally own guns.\n\nBut let\u2019s examine the rhetoric he used to convey his \u201cphilosophy\u201d (if you could call it that):\n\nI will be supporting Clive Bundy and his family from Federal Government slaughter. This is the next Waco! His ranch is under siege right now! The federal gov is stealing his cattle! Arresting his family and beating on them! We must do something, I will be doing something.\n\nIf Bundy and his pals in the militia were out there in the Nevada desert fighting off the Bureau of Land Management over marijuana, it\u2019s quite a scoop. Those are all the usual right-wing talking points about the standoff. In the L.A. Times, Amanda Miller\u2019s father characterized Miller by saying \u201che was was into all this Patriot Nation and conspiracy theory stuff,\u201d which is not normally how one would describe marijuana legalization activism.\n\nKincaid homes in on Miller\u2019s affinity for Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist, who also, as it happens, rails against the drug war. In Kincaid\u2019s mind that closes the case, however, he seems not to know that Alex Jones calls himself a libertarian and a conservative whose anti-government beliefs are so extreme that he believes both 9/11 and Oklahoma City are government conspiracies as was the Newtown massacre. His most famous public appearance was on CNN in defense of gun rights:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms! Doesn\u2019t matter how many lemmings you get out there on the street, begging for \u2019em to have their guns taken. We will not relinquish them. Do you understand?! That\u2019s why you\u2019re going to fail, and the establishment knows, no matter how much propaganda, the republic will rise again!\u201d\n\nSo yes, it\u2019s possible that the combination of far-right rhetoric along with a libertarian desire to end the drug war attracted Miller to Jones, but it\u2019s pretty clear that it was the guns that bound them to each other most strongly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Conservatives now trying to claim that the Vegas shooters were somehow lefty radicals.
