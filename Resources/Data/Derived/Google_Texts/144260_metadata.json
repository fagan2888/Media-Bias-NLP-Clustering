That\u2019s what the players, coaches and parents say led to the success of this year\u2019s Michiana Pop Warner Junior Pee Wee football team.\n\nThe Bulldogs became contenders for a regional title after beating Valparaiso, 20-0, to win the Northern Indiana Pop Warner Little Scholars state championship earlier this month. The team remained undefeated heading into Saturday\u2019s scheduled game in Michigan City against Fox Valley Pop Warner of Appleton, Wis.\n\nThe Junior Pee Wee team is composed of boys age 8 to 11 from South Bend, Elkhart and Granger. They are coached by Dan Brassell and about a half dozen assistants, mostly fathers.\n\nThe state championship placed the team at 11-0 for the season, Brassell said, averaging more than 30 points per game and allowing opponents to score just 40 points in all the games combined.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an amazing streak,\u201d said Zach Jellison, an assistant coach whose 9-year-old son, Brayden, plays on the 24-member team. For Brayden, winning the championship \u201cfelt cool.\u201d He said he and his friends jumped and cheered a lot.\n\nBrassell credits the team\u2019s success to having a lot of veteran players, including six 11-year-olds.\n\n\u201cThey listen good, they\u2019re committed, and they show up and practice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe players are good friends on and off the field,\u201d said assistant coach Jonathan Thomas, father of Jalen Thomas, 9, referring to all of the boys who played either with or against each other in prior years.\n\nPop Warner football has a variety of divisions based on age and weight. There is also a scholastic requirement players must meet (a 2.0 GPA on a 4.0 scale). Junior Pee Wee players have a maximum weight of 105 pounds for 8-, 9- and 10-year-olds. Eleven-year-olds weighing less than 85 pounds also can be on the team.\n\nTo celebrate the championship, the team had a pizza party at Barnaby\u2019s in South Bend that was attended by more than 100 people, counting team members and their families, said Elisabeth Rutten, team mom. The players wore their team jerseys and championship hats and showed off the big trophy they received.\n\nThe players were still excited about the trophy at a recent practice at O\u2019Brien Park. \u201cIt felt great,\u201d 11-year-old Kobe Luuga said of winning. The son of assistant coach Seabe Luuga has played five years and said he wasn\u2019t surprised to win because he and his teammates \u201cgive 100 percent at every practice.\u201d\n\nJoseph Gomez, 11, a three-year player, said, \u201cWe shouted we were so happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe boys on this team have completely taken the idea of team play to heart, always encouraging and cheering for each other,\u201d Rutten said. \u201cIt has been something awesome to watch and their good attitudes are a credit to the coaches and the families.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy job (as team mom) has been easy because of the tremendous support by the parents. And they are positive with the players while watching the games,\u201d said Rutten, a contrast to some parents she\u2019s observed from other teams.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great team,\u201d said 11-year-old Robert Saunders, whose nickname is \u201cSpongeBob.\u201d \u201cWe work as a team, not as one person.\u201d\n\nTo assistant coach Leo Koley, who grew up playing Pop Warner football in Chicago, winning the championship \u201cis a beautiful thing I can share with my son (Anthony Figueroa, 11,) for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nLiz Vervaet has 10-year-old twin sons, Jakobe and Jay Luster, who have played five years. Pop Warner is a family affair with the boys\u2019 father and stepfather serving as assistant coaches and grandmother, Linda Vervaet, on the sidelines for most practices and games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great group. Good boys and nice families,\u201d Liz Vervaet said. \u201cTo win a championship the first time many were eligible to play for it is a nice reward for all the hard work, commitment and dedication by the players.\u201d\n\nPractice started Aug. 1 and will continue as long as they win, even in cold weather. Some boys, like hers, now play basketball so have back-to-back practices.\n\nA coach for 11 years, Brassell has no kids on the team, but thoroughly enjoys his role. Looking at his teams as poker hands, he said, \u201cThis year just clicked. Like we got a royal flush.\u201d\n\nThe Bulldogs were slated to play a team from Genesee County, Mich., on Nov. 17, but that team forfeited, leading the local team to the semifinal game Saturday, Brassell said.\n\nParents and coaches praised the excellent support from the Junior Pee Wee cheerleading squad that keeps spirits high at games. The squad placed second at state, and then earned a first place in the Mid-American Regional to qualify to go Disney World in Florida in December to compete in the national championship.\n\nAltogether, the Michiana Pop Warner program serves some 250 area students through football teams and cheer squads, said Arnez Lee, league president.
