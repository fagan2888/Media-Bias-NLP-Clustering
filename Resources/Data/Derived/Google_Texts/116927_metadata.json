A coalition calling itself SAGES \u2014 which stands for \u201cStudents for Sex and Gender Equity and Safety\u201d \u2014 is circulating a petition demanding access to contraception.\n\n\u201cWe demand that the Fordham administration and Board of Trustees take action. Fordham\u2019s outdated policies facilitate a sex-negative campus culture,\u201d the petition, which has garnered about 200 signatures so far, reads. Students are asking the administration to provide free condoms in community spaces, free birth control and STD consultations in the health center, more resources for pregnant students, and more housing options for students who identify as transgender.\n\nThe SAGES coalition has been actively challenging Fordham\u2019s birth control policy for the past several weeks, posting flyers around campus and handing out condoms at school events. At football games and homecoming activities this fall, they passed out condoms attached to a message reading, \u201cStudents deserve safety.\u201d The student activists with SAGES have also partnered with the \u201cCondom Fairy,\u201d an anonymous sexual health proponent who distributes condoms around Fordham\u2019s Lincoln Center campus.\n\n\u201cStudent health and safety is non-negotiable,\u201d one of the organizers with SAGES, senior Rachel Field, told USA Today earlier this month. \u201cThe desire to go to an institution of learning should not mean that you have to sacrifice your health to do so. The UN has stated that birth control is a human right\u2026 why are we being denied human rights at Fordham?\u201d\n\nLike many Catholic schools, Fordham technically has a policy that states students may obtain birth control pills on campus \u201cfor the treatment of an existing medical condition accompanied by supporting documentation.\u201d But Field and her fellow organizers say that medical exemption doesn\u2019t actually work in practice.\n\nIn an interview with the Village Voice, Field explained that she used the Depo-Provera birth control shot to prevent ovarian cysts for several years before she started college. But a nurse at Fordham\u2019s health center refused to administer those injections, and it took Field some time to find another doctor in New York. Using the hormonal method inconsistently gave her negative side effects, and she eventually went off the medication \u2014 and ended up in the hospital with a ruptured cyst. Even with paperwork documenting her hospital stay, the employees at Fordham\u2019s student health center still refused to give Depo-Provera to Field.\n\nField\u2019s story isn\u2019t unusual. An estimated 1.5 million women use birth control for medical reasons, like regulating painful periods, addressing acne, or preventing ovarian cysts. And teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 \u2014 the people who are heading to college for the first time \u2014 are the demographic group that\u2019s most likely to rely on contraception for those health issues.\n\nIn Sandra Fluke\u2019s infamous testimony in favor of Obamacare\u2019s birth control coverage policy \u2014 which has since launched her into a political career \u2014 she pointed out that students at Catholic colleges are particularly vulnerable when their student health plans won\u2019t cover birth control, since the loopholes for medical conditions don\u2019t usually work in practice. Fluke told a story about a friend who, like Field, suffered from ovarian cysts yet couldn\u2019t get a birth control prescription from Georgetown University.\n\nThe religiously-fueled controversy over sexual health services has inspired similar pushback at other Catholic schools. Last year, activists at Boston College, which is a Jesuit institution, faced potential disciplinary action for passing out condoms on campus. Georgetown students recently launched a condom delivery service on their campus. The ACLU has warned Catholic administrations that they don\u2019t necessarily have a right to crack down on students for that activity.\n\nCatholic colleges weren\u2019t always opposed to birth control; in fact, in the 1960s, faculty at these institutions often pushed for better access to family planning resources. Fordham University was one of those schools. In 1967, after Fordham students petitioned for a class on birth control, the dean of students agreed to implement a sexual education seminar including \u201cfrank discussions of methods of conception and contraception.\u201d That activism challenged what exactly it means to be a Catholic institution, particularly as Catholic individuals\u2019 support for birth control continues to rise.\n\nToday\u2019s Fordham students want to continue that work. \u201cPlease support our struggle for a safer and healthier Fordham University. We believe that this struggle not only has implications for thousands of Fordham Students across New York, but also for millions of students and communities across the nation,\u201d the SAGES petition concludes.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Fordham University students are handing out condoms on campus, saying their administration's approach to contraception is harming their health.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Fordham University students are handing out condoms on campus, saying their administration's approach to contraception is harming their health.", "title": "College Students Fight Catholic School\u2019s \u2018Unfair And Unjust\u2019 Ban On Birth Control", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/10/20/3581788/fordham-students-birth-control/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shutterstock_41986780.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fordham University students are handing out condoms on campus, saying their administration's approach to contraception is harming their health.", "creator": "@Tara_CR", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shutterstock_41986780-321x214.jpg", "title": "College Students Fight Catholic School\u2019s \u2018Unfair And Unjust\u2019 Ban On Birth Control", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shutterstock_41986780.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/shutterstock_41986780.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-20T12:18:28+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/tculpressler"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1df6\"", "article_summary": "An estimated 1.5 million women use birth control for medical reasons, like regulating painful periods, addressing acne, or preventing ovarian cysts.\nHealth College Students Fight Catholic School\u2019s \u2018Unfair And Unjust\u2019 Ban On Birth Control CREDIT: ShutterstockStudent activists at Fordham University, a Catholic school in New York City, are fighting back against what they say is an \u201cunfair and unjust\u201d campus policy that denies them essential reproductive health services.\nCatholic colleges weren\u2019t always opposed to birth control; in fact, in the 1960s, faculty at these institutions often pushed for better access to family planning resources.\nToday\u2019s Fordham students want to continue that work.\nFluke told a story about a friend who, like Field, suffered from ovarian cysts yet couldn\u2019t get a birth control prescription from Georgetown University."}
