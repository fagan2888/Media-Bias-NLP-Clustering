But these benefits often prove illusory in practice, and they never seem to materialize in efforts to build a joint fighter jet. Recent comments by the F-35\u2019s program chief suggest that reality might finally be sinking in\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying they\u2019re bad. I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re good,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan about joint fighter programs, \u201cI\u2019m just saying they\u2019re hard.\u201d Bogdan is only partially right. Joint fighter development is not just difficult in practice. It should not be attempted at all.\n\nRelated: The F-35 Engine Still Has \u2018Recurring Quality Issues\u2019\n\nThe idea behind joint aircraft development is that a common platform will allow several services to reap economies of scale in production. As the F-35 has proved, the opposite is true. According to Defense One\u2019s Marcus Weisgerber, the Joint Strike Fighter\u2019s three variants share only about 20 percent of their parts.\n\nThe reasons for the lack of commonality are simple. The services involved\u2014the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps\u2014have different operational needs, different aviation concepts, and different organizational cultures. Attempts to satisfy all those involved have made the military\u2019s fifth-generation fighter program the most expensive procurement program in military history, although it was sold on its affordability. As a 2013 RAND Corporation study on joint fighter development found that \u201cthe need to accommodate different service requirements in a single design, and\u2026increased weight beyond that needed for some variants, potentially leading to higher overall cost, despite the efficiencies.\u201d\n\nLeaving aside the inherent complexity of weapons that push the technological envelope, reengineering the individual variants of the fighter with service-specific capabilities is all but inevitable. Canceling major programs once they have entered into production is rare enough under normal circumstances. When three services have skin in the game, as they do in the case of the F-35, it becomes almost impossible. With the program approved, log-rolling all but ensured the services were free to reengineer the plane to fit service-specific needs with less fear than usual of cancellation\u2014even as economies of scale were obliterated and costs escalated.\n\nThe result is a deeply flawed, very expensive fighter jet. Attempts to make the fighter a jack-of-all-trades for three services has inevitably led to it being a watered-down master of none\u2014with short range, only over-the-horizon air-to-air combat capability, and questionable ability to provide close air support.\n\nRelated: Why the F-35 May Not Be Combat-Ready Until 2022\n\nYet joint fighter development had an ignominious history even before the Joint Strike Fighter was a flicker in the Pentagon\u2019s imagination. In 1961, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara thought he could save money by making the Air Force and Navy share a common platform . The Tactical Fighter Experimental\u2014initially known as the TFX, and later the F-111\u2014proved to be so costly, and the services\u2019 needs so incompatible, the Navy eventually pulled out of the program. As military aviation historian Richard Hallion has written, \u201cthe critical point too often ignored in discussions of the TFX/F-111 experience was the basic incompatibility of developing a single common airframe to undertake widely differing Air Force and Navy missions.\u201d\n\nThere are practical reasons beyond cost to pursue separate platforms, and benefits to pursuing redundancy rather than uniformity. The former provides options, the basis for comparison, and a failsafe should things go wrong\u2014as they often do in defense acquisition. When the F-111 debacle went down, the Navy\u2019s F-4 Phantom provided a fallback option that McNamara was able to convert into a usable aircraft for the Air Force. Not only did it perform admirably for the service, the F-4 also provided the impetus for later success. A decade later, not wanting to be stuck with another Navy plane, the Air Force developed the F-16\u2014which recently bested the F-35 in a training exercise.\n\nBogdan made his comments on the difficulty of joint fighter development in context of potential Air Force and Navy cooperation in development of a sixth-generation fighter. Based on the few ideas the services have put out for public consumption a potential follow-on for the F-35, compatibility looks to be as illusory as ever. The Air Force wants a manned fighter\u2014unsurprising for a service founded and staffed by pilots\u2014while the Navy wants an unmanned platform. The Air Force wants stealth, while the Navy thinks it is overrated.\n\nAs the services plan their next-generation fighters, they should learn the lesson they have too often ignored: joint fighter development does not work. For the sake of American tactical aviation, and their own wallets, American taxpayers should hope that the F-35 chief\u2019s comments are a sign they have.\n\nThis article originally appeared on DefenseOne.
