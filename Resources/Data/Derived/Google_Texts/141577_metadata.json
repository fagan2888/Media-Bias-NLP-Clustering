The answer, as is the case with most big questions in medicine, is decidedly complicated.\n\nBut a study made freely available this month on the Cornell University-hosted arXiv.org may provide us with some important context. Its authors pored through 14 years worth of FDA records to calculate the frequency and severity of adverse events that occur during minimally invasive robotic surgeries. They found that out of 10,624 such events, there were 144 deaths, 1,391 injuries, and 8,061 device malfunctions.\n\n\u201cDespite widespread adoption of robotic systems for minimally invasive surgery, a nonnegligible number of technical difficulties and complications are still being experienced during procedures,\u201d the authors concluded.\n\nThese adverse events included burnt or broken pieces of the robotic instruments falling into the patient (14.7 percent), electrical arcing of the instruments (10.5 percent), and the ever-dreaded system error (5 percent).\n\nDigging into the types of surgeries performed, they also found that the less complex the procedure and the more commonly robots were utilized, the less chance of something going wrong.\n\n\u201cSurgical specialties, for which robots are extensively used, such as gynecology and urology, had lower number of injuries, deaths, and conversions per procedure than more complex surgeries, such as cardiothoracic and head and neck,\u201d they wrote.\n\nPerhaps more worryingly, the prevalence of reported mistakes increased in the last year of the analysis. \u201cWhile the annual average number of adverse events was about 550 per 100,000 procedures between 2004 and 2011, in 2013 it peaked at about 1,000 events per 100,000 procedures,\u201d they wrote. Thankfully, the average amount of deaths and injuries annually has remained constant since 2007, though that finding could also be seen as evidence that surgeons haven\u2019t taken any proactive steps to become appreciatively better at avoiding errors.\n\nShiny New Toy\n\nThe burning question at heart is whether these numbers are particularly better or worse than those found in conventional surgeries. It\u2019s not an easy comparison to make, if only because of the sheer variety of surgical operations that are performed every year, each coming with a different set of risks and surgical skills needed. And the authors do not attempt to do so in their study.\n\nAccording to a 2012 report released by the Centers for Disease Control, the number of deaths from medical and surgical complications has dramatically lowered from 1999 to 2009, just as these robotic techniques have become increasingly more popular. \u201cDeaths per 100,000 population declined 39 percent, to 71.3 deaths for adults aged \u226585 years; 37 percent, to 51.4 deaths for those aged 75\u201384 years; 38 percent, to 27.9 deaths for adults aged 65\u201374 years; and 28 percent, to 8.9 deaths for adults aged 45\u201364 years rates,\u201d the report concluded.\n\nIt seems virtually impossible to know how much, if any, of this increase in safety is tied to the advent of robots, and the authors of the current study acknowledge that their data is likely undercounting the true number of adverse events as a result of robotic surgery.\n\nWhat is known that while the added benefits of robotic surgery are highly touted, there\u2019s not nearly as much evidence for these claims as patients are led to believe. As detailed by a 2013 JAMA study , often times these technologies are used to entice people into surgical procedures that may require less recovery time but still be unneeded.\n\nThe JAMA authors looked at two different types of recently invented procedures for prostate cancer, including robotic prostatectomy. \u201cThe use of advanced treatment technologies for prostate cancer was common among patients with low-risk disease and among those with a high risk of noncancer mortality,\u201d they concluded. Though they noted that a large number of these procedures were simply replacing the older version and would have been inappropriately performed regardless, they also believed that \u201caggressive direct-to-consumer marketing and incentives associated with fee-for-service payment may promote the use of these advanced treatment technologies.\u201d\n\nIn other words, doctors may subtly turn to these robotic surgeries because they\u2019re more profitable and seen as more effective by both the patient and surgeon \u2014 what we might call the \u201cshiny new toy\u201d effect. That pressure to recommend robotic surgeries over less expensive procedures also comes from the need for hospitals and private practices to recoup their investment, since these technologies can come with a high set-up and upkeep cost.\n\nIn 2013, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) issued their own salvo against the increasing popularity of robots.\n\n\u201cWhile there may be some advantages to the use of robotics in complex hysterectomies, especially for cancer operations that require extensive surgery and removal of lymph nodes, studies have shown that adding this expensive technology for routine surgical care does not improve patient outcomes,\u201d a statement by ACOG president Dr. James Breeden read. \u201dConsequently, there is no good data proving that robotic hysterectomy is even as good as\u2014let alone better \u2014 than existing, and far less costly, minimally invasive alternatives.\u201d\n\nAs noted by the arXIV study, robotic surgeries have been most prevalent among the gynecology and urology field.\n\nSafe As Can Be\n\nNot to be lost in the noise is that the fact that most surgeries, no matter whether performed by robot or man alone, are successful. And there has been research showing that robotic surgeries do have their own unique benefits. A 2015 review on the use of robotic procedures for certain forms of throat cancer found that it resulted in shorter hospital stays, a decreased chance for later, more invasive operations, and an increased chance of finding previously hidden tumors.\n\nSome of the safety concerns that robots bring along with them will also be lessened as surgeons become more familiar with them, which the arXIV study authors conclude as well. \u201cAdoption of advanced techniques in design and operation of robotic surgical systems may reduce these preventable incidents in the future,\u201d they wrote.\n\nUltimately, the decision to undergo robotic surgery should be one you collaborate on with your doctor, making sure to be as aware of their risks and benefits as you can be.\n\nAnd perhaps the best takeaway from this latest study, as well as others, is that robots are as effective as the people who make and operate them. These machines won\u2019t be the only ones who will need to upgrade in order to provide patients the best possible medical care.\n\n\u201cAs the surgical systems continue to evolve with new technologies, uniform standards for surgical team training, advanced human machine interfaces, improved accident investigation and reporting mechanisms, and safety-based design techniques should be developed to reduce incident rates in the future,\u201d the authors conclude.\n\nSource: Alemzadeh H , Iyer R , Kalbarczyk Z.
