Its drivers are multiple and separating one from the other is often quite complicated. Low taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations, the gutting of labor unions, the increased mobility of capital, technological gains, overly protective intellectual property law; the list goes on.\n\nIn fact, here\u2019s another one to add to the list: privatization. According to \u201cRace to the Bottom: How Outsourcing Public Services Rewards Corporations and Punishes the Middle Class,\u201d a new study from In the Public Interest, a think tank focused on how privatization affects the economy, the routine practice of outsourcing government functions is another important reason why the middle class is shrinking as those at the very top reap more and more of the fruits of our economy. To explain how that is \u2014 and why it\u2019s important that people committed to economic justice push back against the practice \u2014 Salon recently spoke with ITPI research and policy director Shar Habibi. Our conversation is below and has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI think the general perception is that privatization/government outsourcing really kicked off under Reagan, so about 30 years ago. Is it still a problem today?\n\nI think that 30-year time frame is correct in terms of when the idea really gained steam, but I would say, since the financial crisis in 2008, there have been a lot of cities and states that have had budget shortfalls and some financial stress, and private companies have been coming in and saying, \u201cWe can do this better, faster and cheaper; we can take over these services and run them for you.\u201d Unfortunately, there\u2019s really a growing body of evidence that these claims are untrue and that public services that have been outsourced are not running better, faster and cheaper. What our report specifically looks at is how government outsourcing degrades jobs and takes what were once middle-class jobs that supported families and turns them into poverty-level jobs.\n\nWhat did you find when you examined privatization/government outsourcing?\n\nWhat this report really looked [at] was the effects of government outsourcing, at the local and state levels, on jobs and the impacts it has on the community and ultimately on the issue of income inequality. What we see is that \u2026 when state or local government outsources, these jobs are no longer good, public-sector jobs that provide a decent wage and benefits, but instead become jobs for a contractor that pay very low wages and typically have very few or no benefits. And really what is kind of alarming about this is [that] outsourcing public services sets off a downward spiral in which reduced worker wages and benefits can hurt the local economy and the overall stability of middle- and working-class communities. By paying family-supporting wages and providing important benefits like health insurance and sick leave, governments have historically created what we\u2019re calling \u201cintentional ladders of opportunity\u201d to allow workers and their families to reach the middle class. And this has been especially true for women and African-Americans, for whom the public sector has been a source of stable, middle-class careers. Unfortunately low-road government contracts reverse this dynamic. So while corporations rake in increasing profits through taxpayer dollars and while CEO compensation continues to soar, the examples in our report show that the workers employed by state and local government contractors receive those low wages and few benefits.\n\nI can share a few examples from the report that I think illustrate this dynamic. There was a study in 2009 that looked at the effects of outsourcing on food services in K-12 public schools in the entire state of New Jersey, and what that researcher found was that the companies \u2026 that take over this function cut workers\u2019 wages on average by $4-$6 per-hour, following privatization. A lot of those workers completely lost their health-insurance benefits. And, in fact, at that time food service contractors had the highest level of employees and their children enrolled in the New Jersey family care program, which is the state\u2019s Medicaid program \u2014 and that\u2019s another aspect to this, that there are hidden costs to outsourcing that are not taken into consideration when state and local governments make that decision to outsource. When contractors slash wages and get rid of benefits, that means that those workers are newly eligible for some public assistance programs, so that\u2019s an increase in another part of the budget.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Outsourcing government not only leads to poor services -- it's killing the middle class, an expert tells Salon", "author": "Elias Isquith", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Outsourcing government not only leads to poor services -- it's killing the middle class, an expert tells Salon", "title": "One percent\u2019s twisted new heist: What\u2019s really behind privatization", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/06/06/one_percents_twisted_new_heist_whats_really_behind_privatization/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/dimon_trump_koch.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Outsourcing government not only leads to poor services -- it's killing the middle class, an expert tells Salon", "creator": "@eliasisquith", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/06/dimon_trump_koch.jpg", "title": "One percent\u2019s twisted new heist: What\u2019s really behind privatization", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "One percent\u2019s twisted new heist: What\u2019s really behind privatization", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, 1 percent, Editor's Picks, free-market, Government Outsourcing, In the Public Interest, Inequality, neoliberal, neoliberalism, one percent, privatization, privatize, Shar Habibi", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf639\"", "article_summary": "I think the general perception is that privatization/government outsourcing really kicked off under Reagan, so about 30 years ago.\nWhat our report specifically looks at is how government outsourcing degrades jobs and takes what were once middle-class jobs that supported families and turns them into poverty-level jobs.\nIn fact, here\u2019s another one to add to the list: privatization.\nAnd this has been especially true for women and African-Americans, for whom the public sector has been a source of stable, middle-class careers.\nA lot of those workers completely lost their health-insurance benefits."}
