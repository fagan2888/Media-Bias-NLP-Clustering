HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) â€” John Hunter Nemechek emerged from the carnage that took out the front runners to win the NASCAR Truck series race at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Saturday.

Nemechek, the son of longtime Cup driver Joe Nemechek, held off Cameron Hayley by 0.31 seconds to capture his second career Truck victory.

On a restart with two laps to go, the 18-year-old came through the trioval side by side with John Wes Townley. When Townley got loose, Nemechek pulled away to win for a team that lacks a major sponsor.

Matt Crafton led much of the race, only to get taken out in a huge wreck caused by Christopher Bell with 19 laps to go. The wreck also claimed Bell's teammate, Daniel Suarez, who was running second.

Bell surged to the lead after the wreckage was cleared, but he cut a tire with seven laps remaining and slammed into the wall.
