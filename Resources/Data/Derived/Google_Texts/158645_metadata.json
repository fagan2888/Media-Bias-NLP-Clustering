Getty Images\n\nWhen I was little, my friend\u2019s older brother, who had long hair and was kind of reckless, used to listen to Johnny Winter with his older, reckless friends. So of course, we started to listen to Johnny Winter too.\n\nHe is sort of harsh at first and an acquired taste but we came to fiercely love his music and claimed him our own. He died yesterday at age 70 in hotel room in Zurich, while touring Europe in support of his new album.\n\nIn a recent WSJ story by Marc Myers, Winter said, \u201cMy whole life changed overnight\u2014going from playing little clubs to huge concert halls,\u201d referring to a chance walk-on performance in New York in 1968. \u201cI was trying to play the blues like the Mississippi guys, but I had my own thing. I didn\u2019t sound like any other rock guitarists then. My feeling was more intense,\u201d said Winter, who is known for his searing, high-speed style with the guitar.\n\nHis playing got the attention of a friend of Clive Davis \u2014 then president of Columbia Records \u2014 who happened to be in the audience. Davis signed Winter to a lucrative six-album deal shortly thereafter.\n\nRead the full story on the late blues musician Johnny Winter here.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Blues-guitar legend Johnny Winter died yesterday at 70 while on tour in Europe.
