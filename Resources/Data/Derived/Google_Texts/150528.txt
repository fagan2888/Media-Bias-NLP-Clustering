Police are looking into a fire at the home of the former South Carolina police officer accused in the shooting death of a black man last April.

Local media outlets report the fire at the vacant home of Michael Slager was reported around 9:20 p.m. Friday in Hanahan.

Slager is the former North Charleston police officer charged with murder in the shooting death of Walter Scott.

Charleston County Sheriff's Maj. Eric Watson confirmed that a glass cocktail bottle was found at the scene. A portion of the home's vinyl siding was damaged in the fire.

Hanahan Police Capt. Michael Fowler said an arson investigation is underway.

Slager, who is white, was released on bond Monday. Activists want him back in jail because they say he's a danger to the community.
