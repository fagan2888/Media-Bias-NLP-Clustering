State representatives want Oklahoma to join a handful of other states in refusing to accept Syrian refugees in wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris, France.

Governor Fallin has yet to make an official announcement. But legislators in the Anti-Terrorism Caucus have written Governor Fallin a letter, stating the Syrian refugee crisis is a, “Huge public safety and homeland security issue.”

Head of the caucus, Representative John Bennett, told News 9, “We have no obligation to take (the refugees) into our country… we don’t know if we’re accepting terrorists or not.”

Texas, Arkansas, Michigan and Alabama governors have already announced they will not accept any refugees from Syria.

Monday at the G20 Summit in Turkey, President Obama said of accepting refugees, "Slamming the door in their faces would be a betrayal of our values.”
