Several millages and proposals on the ballot, here is a break down:

- The proposal to expand the BWL Board of commissioners was approved by City of Lansing voters. Voters agreed to add three non-voting members to the board. The amendment passed with 65% of the vote.

One board member will represent Delta Township, one will represent East Lansing and the third-at large seat will rotate each year between Meridian, Delhi, DeWitt and Lansing townships. The changes stem from the December ice storm fiasco after customers who lived outside Lansing city limits complained about not having representation even though they were BWL customers.

- The second BWL amendment that gives Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero more power over BWL during emergencies, such as the ice storm, also passed with 68% of the vote.

- The three-million dollar health care millage in Ingham County passed with 70% of the vote. The millage renewal request was put on the ballot even though the Ingham County Health Plan currently has a $10 million surplus.

But, commissioners say the surplus won't last and say the funds were needed.

"There needs to be a safety net of services that are available for those that don't qualify for insurance or for medicaid under the Affordable Care Act," says Ingham County Deputy Controller Jared Cypher.

Since the millage was renewed, it kicks in fiscal year 2016. It averages out to about $52 for homeowners with a home that has a taxable value of $100,000. This money belongs solely to the Ingham Health Plan, which means it cannot be used for anything else in the county.

- A bit of disappointment for the Eaton Rapids Public School District. The sinking fund millage was voted down.

53% of voters said no to the millage, with 47% voting in favor of it. The district wanted to repair a leaky roof and defective boilers, along with other safety improvements.

- The Eaton County road millage passed with 51% of the vote. That money is going to to be used solely to fix local roads in Eaton County.

The 12-year, 1.5 mill is expected to generate over $4 million for roads in the first year.
