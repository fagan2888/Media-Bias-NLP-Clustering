And I\u2019ve been shocked and fascinated to notice that amid all the punditry over whether it was right for a thief to claim moral high ground over cheaters like some sort of relationships Robin Hood, there were some fundamental misunderstandings about relationships.\n\nI would even go so far as to say that our misunderstandings about relationships, as a culture, have led to such a high preponderance of cheating.\n\nHere are just a few of them:\n\nMisconception No. 1: The Ashley Madison hack destroyed millions of relationships.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth. The hack didn\u2019t end any relationships. Those relationships ended the moment someone snuck behind a partner\u2019s back and joined the website. That was the actual rupture in the relationship. From that point forward, until both partners found out the truth, they were each living in different realities. The leak\u2014 however right- or wrong-headed it may have been\u2014repaired the rupture, and gave couples a chance to resume their relationship.\n\nMisconception No. 2: But while cheating is wrong, so is invading someone\u2019s privacy. Their freedom of choice in their private lives was taken away from them.\n\nThis is kind of like saying that we should not investigate murderers. They should have the option of confessing or not confessing on their own when they\u2019re ready.\n\nObviously, it\u2019s rare for cheaters to choose of their own free will to tell their partner what they\u2019ve done. Typically, either they get caught\u2014or they know they\u2018re about to be caught, so they confess. So whether it was a hack, a suspicious partner snooping through their computer, or an affair partner blowing the whistle, their privacy was still likely going to be invaded.\n\nGetting caught is something that everyone signs up for when they start cheating, just as they sign up for losing when they buy a lottery ticket.\n\nIt just happened this time in a way they didn\u2019t expect.\n\nAs for whether it\u2019s OK for other people to know about it, or the consequences for those living in other countries where adultery is criminalized, that also was a risk they signed up for the moment they joined and gave their credit card number to Ashley Madison, leaving a technological slime trail behind for anyone to discover.\n\nMisconception No. 3: But not everyone on Ashley Madison was cheating. Some people just joined and never used it. Others may have been in open relationships.\n\nThe but-I-never-used-it excuse is no excuse. Anything you do behind your partner\u2019s back that you don\u2019t tell them because it would upset them if you did, is cheating. The only real people on Ashley Madison who didn\u2019t cheat are either those who weren\u2019t in relationships when they joined or those who did it with full disclosure to\u2014or in collaboration with\u2014their partners.\n\nThere\u2019s a concept called defensive grandiosity, which is when, to ward off a feeling of shame or powerlessness, we do something to reassert our sense of power or value. So even if someone just signed up as an unconscious fuck-you to a partner one night, unless they told them about it, they still created a rift in the relationship and have issues that need to be resolved.\n\nMisconception No. 4: If you checked the data dump and didn\u2019t find your partner there, it\u2019s a good sign.\n\nNo, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s a horrible sign. If you have to investigate your partner, then you are in an unhealthy relationship. In fact, by the previously mentioned definition, you\u2019re actually cheating if you\u2019re doing it behind their back.\n\nBecause there are only three possible outcomes to searching for a loved one: Your partner is breaking your trust, you have trust issues, or both are true and symbiotically connected in one grand dysfunctional relationship.\n\nSo if you checked the data, no matter what you found, you need to have a serious discussion with yourself, and then with your partner.\n\nMisconception No. 5: It was mostly men on Ashley Madison because it\u2019s mostly men who cheat.\n\nSome of the old tropes about gender differences need to die, along with the evolutionary theories used to justify them. Don\u2019t take my word for it. Take the Kinsey Institute\u2019s: \u201cEarly studies reportedly found that men engaged in infidelity more than women (Wiederman, 1997). However, more recent research seems to suggest that the gender gap is narrowing (Barta & Kiene, 2005; Burdette, Ellison, Sherkat, & Gore, 2007) and when transgressions other than intercourse (e.g., emotional connection, kissing) are taken into account, women report as many acts of infidelity as men (Allen et al., 2005; Treas & Giesen, 2000).\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Getting caught is something that every cheater signs up for, for starters", "title": "The Ashley Madison hack revealed more than names: What we still get wrong about cheating, lying, privacy and marriage", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Getting caught is something that every cheater signs up for, for starters", "title": "The Ashley Madison hack revealed more than names: What we still get wrong about cheating, lying, privacy and marriage", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/09/13/the_ashley_madison_hack_revealed_more_than_names_what_we_still_get_wrong_about_cheating_lying_privacy_and_marriage/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/man_removing_wedding_ring.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Getting caught is something that every cheater signs up for, for starters", "title": "The Ashley Madison hack revealed more than names: What we still get wrong about cheating, lying, privacy and marriage", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/09/man_removing_wedding_ring.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Neil Strauss", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, aol_on, AShley Madison, Ashley Madison hack, Editor's Picks, Infidelity, Love, Marriage, Pick up artists, Sex, The Game", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: aol_on, AShley Madison, Ashley Madison hack, Editor's Picks, Infidelity, Love, Marriage, Pick up artists, Sex, The Game, Life News, Entertainment NewsFor the last two months, I\u2019ve been closely following the Ashley Madison hack coverage.\n1: The Ashley Madison hack destroyed millions of relationships.\n5: It was mostly men on Ashley Madison because it\u2019s mostly men who cheat.\n3: But not everyone on Ashley Madison was cheating.\nThe hack didn\u2019t end any relationships."}
