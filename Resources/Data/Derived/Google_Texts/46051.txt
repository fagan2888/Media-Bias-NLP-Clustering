On “The Kelly File” last night, Weekly Standard editor and general conservative standard-bearer Charles Krauthammer accused President Barack Obama of merely “pretending” to be attempting to fight ISIS in the Middle East.

“There is no denying that [the president’s] strategy is an abject failure,” Krauthammer argued, so much so that “you have to wonder how serious the president is about it in the first place.”

And wonder he did, noting that there have only been 135 air strikes in Ramadi, whereas in the 1999 offensive in Kosovo, the United States was averaging 10,000 sorties a month.

“This is not serious — this is for show,” Krauthammer said. “This is for the president to pretend that he’s doing something, when actually, he is willfully and actively and knowingly not doing anything.”
