Texans would apply through the flawed Obamacare while Californians would use a California-specific web page.\n\nApplicants can also apply on the phone and by post and have until mid-December to ensure that they are covered by January 1.\n\nThose who can afford healthcare but remain uninsured face a potential fine under the law, which is designed to encourage more people into the health insurance market.\n\nNo one answered at the Department of Health and Human Services, the department in charge of implementing the law, to several calls requesting comment.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "GSACategory": "worldnews", "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02703/healthcare_2703166a.png"}, "site": "@Telegraph", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@rafsanchez"}, "keywords": "US Politics,World News,News", "DCSext.cmsSect": "News;World_News;USA;Barack_Obama;US_Politics;Raf_Sanchez", "DCSext.Channel": "news", "DCSext.MLC": "/news/worldnews/us-politics", "DCSext.Content_Type": "Story", "WT.cg_n": "news", "title": "Obamacare website dogged by 'excruciatingly embarrassing' technical problems", "section-id": 6227, "GSAGenre": "uspolitics", "tmgads.pagetype": "Story", "DCSext.akamigeo": "US", "tmgads.section": "news-worldnews-us_politics", "GSAMLC": "news/worldnews/uspolitics", "GSAArticleType": "Story", "article-id": 10381112, "WT.cg_s": "worldnews", "description": "Two weeks after the launch of healthcare.gov, the web portal at the heart of \n  Barack Obama's plan to insure millions of people, the site is still wracked \n  with glitches.", "tmgads.channel": "news", "DCSext.pd": 1, "DCSext.Category": "worldnews", "DCSext.Level": 4, "DC.date.issued": "2013-10-15", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "GSASectionUniqueName": "news-world_news-us_politics", "last-modified": "2013-10-15", "fb": {"admins": "686953094,531239902,100002344351237", "app_id": 120118784736295}, "article": {"publisher": 143666524748, "contenttype": "story", "section": "World", "wordcount": 514, "embedcount": 0, "authorName": "Raf Sanchez", "tag": "Raf Sanchez", "subsection": "US Politics", "videocount": 0, "internallinkcount": 8, "imagecount": 2, "externallinkcount": 1}, "DCSext.articleId": 10381112, "tmgads.articleid": 10381112, "tmgads.level": 4, "tmgads.geo": "US", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Obamacare website dogged by \\u0027excruciatingly embarrassing\\u0027 technical problems \",\"link\": \"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/10381112/Obamacare-website-dogged-by-excruciatingly-embarrassing-technical-problems.html\",\"image_url\": \"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02703/healthcare_2703166a.png\",\"type\": \"post\",\"post_id\": \"10381112\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-15T16:45:53Z\",\"section\": \"World\",\"authors\": [\"Raf Sanchez\"],\"tags\": [\"Story\",\"News\",\"World News\",\"USA\",\"Barack Obama\",\"US Politics\",\"Raf Sanchez\"]}", "GSAChannel": "news", "GSAChannelName": "News", "og": {"site_name": "Telegraph.co.uk", "description": "Two weeks after the launch of healthcare.gov, the web portal at the heart of   Barack Obama's plan to insure millions of people, the site is still wracked   with glitches.", "title": "Obamacare website dogged by 'excruciatingly embarrassing' technical problems", "url": "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/us-politics/10381112/Obamacare-website-dogged-by-excruciatingly-embarrassing-technical-problems.html", "image": "http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02703/healthcare_2703166a.png", "type": "article"}, "DCSext.Genre": "us-politics", "DCSext.cf": 1, "tmgads.zone": "news.worldnews.us-politics", "DCSext.author": "Raf Sanchez", "DCSext.articleFirstPublished": "2013-10-15 17:45"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc1f1\"", "article_summary": "The website that was supposed to be give millions of Americans access to health coverage through Obamacare is \"excruciatingly embarrassing\" and dogged by technical problems, according to a former senior aide to the president.\nWhile the White House initially insisted that the site's problems were caused by its popularity even some of Mr Obama's most loyal supporters have admitted major technical flas.\nThe White House has so far refused to say how many people have successfully signed up for healthcare through the website, saying it would release monthly totals.\nNo one answered at the Department of Health and Human Services, the department in charge of implementing the law, to several calls requesting comment.\nThe site is only used for those applicants in states where the local government has not set up its own website."}
