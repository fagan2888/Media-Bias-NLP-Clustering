Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nFifty years after Dr. Luther R. Terry first warned Americans about the dangers of smoking in his landmark surgeon general\u2019s report in 1964, the federal government has made huge strides in persuading Americans to quit: Smoking rates among adults have plummeted to 18 percent, from 42 percent in 1964.\n\nBut this year\u2019s surgeon general\u2019s report about the health consequences of smoking emphasizes that the battle against smoking is far from over and issues a challenge to eliminate it altogether.\n\nSurgeon General Boris Lushniak told reporters Friday that the nation must push even harder to eradicate smoking, with the goal of cutting the cigarette smoking rate down to 12 percent by 2020. \"Enough is enough,\" he said.\n\nThe report, which was formally released by the White House on Friday morning, says, \u201cFor the United States, the epidemic of smoking-caused disease in the 20th century ranks among the greatest public health catastrophes of the century, while the decline of smoking consequent to tobacco control is surely one of public health\u2019s greatest successes ... However, the current rate of progress in tobacco control is not fast enough, and much more needs to be done to end the tobacco epidemic.\u201d\n\nThe report compiles the last 50 years of research on smoking and its effects on nearly every organ of the body. It describes the public-health efforts to curtail smoking, which have included bans on smoking indoors, the elimination of cigarette ads on television and heavily taxed cigarette purchases.\n\nThe result is that \u201cAmericans\u2019 collective view of smoking has been transformed from an accepted national pastime to a discouraged threat to individual and public health,\u201d Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius wrote in the report. \u201cStrong policies have largely driven cigarette smoking out of public view and public air space.\u201d\n\nBut more needs to be done, and the surgeon general vowed to accelerate polices aimed at making the U.S smoke-free.\n\n\u201cWe will explore endgame strategies that support the goal of eliminating tobacco smoking, including greater restrictions on sales,\" the report stated.\n\nThe surgeon general\u2019s office wrote that more than 20 million Americans have died from smoking-related illnesses in the last 50 years.\n\nSome 2.5 million of those people were nonsmokers who died from heart disease or lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke, the report said. And exposure to secondhand smoke increases the risk of stroke by 20 to 30 percent, the report found.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Surgeon general marks 50th anniversary of landmark public-health study with new warning over smoking epidemic", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/1/17/surgeon-general-publishes50thanniversarysmokingreport.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/1/17/surgeon-general-publishes50thanniversarysmokingreport/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.smoking_011714.1390606955114.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "Surgeon general marks 50th anniversary of landmark public-health study with new warning over smoking epidemic", "title": "US explores tobacco\u2019s endgame, as report lists new known harms"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2014/1/17/surgeon-general-publishes50thanniversarysmokingreport/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.smoking_011714.1390606955114.jpg", "description": "Surgeon general marks 50th anniversary of landmark public-health study with new warning over smoking epidemic", "card": "summary", "title": "US explores tobacco\u2019s endgame, as report lists new known harms"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Public Health, E-cigarettes, Smoking, U.S., Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2b48\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe will explore endgame strategies that support the goal of eliminating tobacco smoking, including greater restrictions on sales,\" the report stated.\nThe surgeon general\u2019s office wrote that more than 20 million Americans have died from smoking-related illnesses in the last 50 years.\nBut this year\u2019s surgeon general\u2019s report about the health consequences of smoking emphasizes that the battle against smoking is far from over and issues a challenge to eliminate it altogether.\nAnd exposure to secondhand smoke increases the risk of stroke by 20 to 30 percent, the report found.\nSome 2.5 million of those people were nonsmokers who died from heart disease or lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke, the report said."}
