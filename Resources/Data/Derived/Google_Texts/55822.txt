JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - A man suspected of robbing a convenience store Sunday on Normandy Boulevard fled the scene on a bicycle, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.

Police are asking for the community's help to identify the man (pictured above).

According to police, around 8:25 a.m. Sunday, a robbery was reported at the Murphy's gas station in the 6800 block of Normandy Boulevard. The investigation revealed a man entered the business and stated, "Give it all to me" while lifting his shirt and reaching at his waistband.
