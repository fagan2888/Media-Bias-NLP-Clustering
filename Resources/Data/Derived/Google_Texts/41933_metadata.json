Alexian CEO Mark Frey also is CEO of Amita. David Crane is CEO of Adventist and chief operating officer and executive vice president of Amita.\n\n\u201cThis name marks a new beginning firmly rooted in our faith traditions and our past accomplishments,\u201d Frey said in a statement today. \u201cThe name is our promise to deliver the most efficient, high-quality, faith-based care.\u201d\n\nAmita beat out more than 2,000 words, combinations and potential names, the statement said. The name was inspired by the meaning it has in several languages, such as \"friendship\" in Italian and \"honesty\" and \"truth\" in Hebrew. It also is a nod to the networks' faith-based call to healing, the statement said.\n\nAlexian is part of St. Louis-based Ascension Health. the largest Catholic hospital chain in the country. Adventist is part of Altamonte Springs, Fla.-based Adventist Health System.\n\nThe joint operating company is just shy of a merger. Both Alexian and Adventist remain separate health care systems, but teaming up allows them to save on back-office operations and big investments, such as information technology.\n\nThe partnership also helps them compete amid a drastic shift in the health care industry. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurers financially reward doctors and hospitals to better coordinate care to keep patients healthy and away from pricey hospital stays and treatments. Previously, providers were paid for each service and test they provided, which did little to deter racking up the bills.", "article_metadata": {"taxo_Sections": "News", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "byline": "Kristen Schorsch", "timeCrawled": "20160526_00:52:47", "categoryName": "CCB - Health Care", "title": "Alexian Brothers, Adventist Midwest name new joint company Amita Health", "taxo_Industries": "Hospitals", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=571426684", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150413/NEWS03/150419957/AR/0/AR-150419957.jpg", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2d89ef", "fb": {"admins": 100001125868754}, "summary": "Meet Amita Health, the moniker that beat out more than 2,000 words, combinations and potential names.", "og": {"site_name": "Crain's Chicago Business", "description": "Meet Amita Health, the moniker that beat out more than 2,000 words, combinations and potential names.", "title": "Alexian, Adventist have a new name for their joint venture", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20150413/NEWS03/150419957/alexian-adventist-have-a-new-name-for-their-joint-venture", "image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150413/NEWS03/150419957/AR/0/AR-150419957.jpg", "type": "article"}, "published_at": "2015-4-13", "url": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article//NEWS03/150419957", "content_type": "article", "taxo_Companies": "Alexian Brothers Health System", "google-site-verification": "0QcjJi4OGS9bKu4FBKK58V93fKv0WYCQb7IFbmjATew", "twitter": {"image": "http://www.chicagobusiness.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CG/20150413/NEWS03/150419957/AR/0/AR-150419957.jpg&maxw=400", "site": "@CrainsChicago", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Alexian Brothers, Adventist Midwest name new joint company Amita Health"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui", "description": "Visit Crain's Chicago Business for complete business news and analysis including healthcare, real estate, manufacturing, government, sports and more."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc95e\"", "article_summary": "Meet Amita Health, the new name of the joint operating company formed by Alexian Brothers Health System and Adventist Midwest Health.\nNorthwest suburban Alexian, a five-hospital network based in Arlington Heights, and west suburban Adventist, a four-hospital network based in Hinsdale, formed the company Feb. 1.\nAdventist is part of Altamonte Springs, Fla.-based Adventist Health System.\nAlexian CEO Mark Frey also is CEO of Amita.\nThe partnership also helps them compete amid a drastic shift in the health care industry."}
