He's a big survivor.\"\n\nAllies praise the outgoing parliament for passing more legislation than any of its predecessors, including laws empowering women against domestic violence and sexual harassment.\n\nIn 2010, Zardari relinquished much of his power to the prime minister, rolling back on decades of meddling by military rulers in an effort to institutionalise parliamentary democracy.\n\nBut critics say he showed no leadership in the face of economic decline and spiralling insecurity, laying accusations of poor governance and rampant corruption at his door.\n\n\"Continuity is a positive development in a country like Pakistan where political leaders don't last long. Other than that there is no achievement you could really highlight,\" said Askari.\n\nPrime Minister Sharif has inherited a surge in terrorist attacks. Shootings and bomb attacks are now a daily reality.\n\nNothing has been done to eliminate the plethora of militant networks blamed for violence in Pakistan, Afghanistan and India.\n\nReligious violence has reached dizzying levels with the Shiite Muslim minority bearing the brunt.\n\nMeanwhile Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and its business hub, is suffering from record killings linked to political and ethnic tensions.\n\nSharif has made his top priority resolving a chronic energy crisis and trying to revive the economy.\n\nHe was left with no option but to secure a $6.7 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund to reduce a fiscal deficit that neared nine percent of gross domestic product last year.\n\nZardari spoke of the need for reconciliation at a farewell lunch hosted for him by Sharif, which earnt plaudits from commentators praising the dignity of the handover.\n\n\"Today we need reconciliation. Everyone needs it, so we have to work together under your leadership. We will strengthen our country. We cannot afford divisions,\" Zardari said.\n\n\"It is a question of our future generation. History will not forgive us if we do not realise the situation and the threats (Pakistan faces). We have to save Pakistan from future threats.\"\n\nAides deny that Zardari, unpopular and divisive within the PPP, will spend most of his time abroad and insist that he will base himself in Pakistan and immerse himself in trying to revive the party.\n\nThe centre-left PPP ran a rudderless general election campaign earlier this year and has been thrust into its greatest crisis, suffering a crushing electoral defeat without a true leader.\n\nHis son, Bilawal, is chairman but can only run for parliament after he turns 25 on September 21 and is seen by many observers as a reluctant heir to the legacy of his assassinated mother Bhutto.\n\nHis younger sister, Aseefa, publicly registered to vote this week and some observers believe she has more of the charisma and political hunger needed to replace her mother.\n\nZardari's spokesman Farhatullah Babar told AFP that Zardari will relocate to Lahore \"to start yet another chapter in political struggle\" and analysts suggest he will try to revive the party dominated by the Bhutto-Zardari family.\n\nHe is due to vacate the presidency for the last time on Sunday to a guard of honour. Hussain is to be sworn in on Monday.\n\n...,/.,", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/WORLD/WORLD REGIONS/Asia", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-06 12:19:10 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari steps down on Sunday having defied expectations by holding onto power for a record five years but facing criticism for leaving the economy and security in a shocking state.", "twitter": {"description": "Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari steps down on Sunday having defied expectations by holding onto power for a record five years but facing criticism for leaving the economy and security in a shocking state.", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/09/07/zardari-set-to-step-down-as-pakistan-president.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/world/2013/09/07/zardari-set-to-step-down-as-pakistan-president/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1449830734504.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Zardari set to step down as Pakistan president", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/WORLD/WORLD REGIONS/Asia\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"world\",\"title\":\"Zardari set to step down as Pakistan president\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/world/2013/09/07/zardari-set-to-step-down-as-pakistan-president/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1449830734504.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-08T00:43:08Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/09/07/zardari-set-to-step-down-as-pakistan-president.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"a48fbc93-ec98-439f-8451-6e75c6845554\",\"section\":\"world\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari steps down on Sunday having defied expectations by holding onto power for a record five years but facing criticism for leaving the economy and security in a shocking state.", "dc.identifier": "a48fbc93-ec98-439f-8451-6e75c6845554", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "asia", "description": "Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari steps down on Sunday having defied expectations by holding onto power for a record five years but facing criticism for leaving the economy and security in a shocking state.", "prism.section": "world", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "AFP", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Zardari Set To Step Down As Pakistan President", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-06 12:19:10 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari steps down on Sunday having defied expectations by holding onto power for a record five years but facing criticism for leaving the economy and security in a shocking state.", "title": "Zardari set to step down as Pakistan president | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/09/07/zardari-set-to-step-down-as-pakistan-president.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/world/2013/09/07/zardari-set-to-step-down-as-pakistan-president/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-2.img.jpg/0/0/1422623079537.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2013-09-07", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/WORLD/WORLD REGIONS/Asia\"],\"author\":\"\",\"subSection\":\"world\",\"title\":\"Zardari set to step down as Pakistan president\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/images.foxnews.com/content/fox-news/world/2013/09/07/zardari-set-to-step-down-as-pakistan-president/_jcr_content/par/featured-media/media-0.img.jpg/0/0/1449830734504.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-09-08T00:43:08Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/09/07/zardari-set-to-step-down-as-pakistan-president.html\",\"post_id\":\"a48fbc93-ec98-439f-8451-6e75c6845554\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"world\"}"}, "article_summary": "The Supreme Court convicted of contempt and sacked his first prime minister for refusing to ask Switzerland to reopen multi-million-dollar corruption cases against Zardari.\nPrime Minister Sharif has inherited a surge in terrorist attacks.\nFurious that judges sacked under military rule in 2007 were not immediately reinstated when Zardari took power, the courts pursued him.\nNothing has been done to eliminate the plethora of militant networks blamed for violence in Pakistan, Afghanistan and India.\n\"Continuity is a positive development in a country like Pakistan where political leaders don't last long."}
