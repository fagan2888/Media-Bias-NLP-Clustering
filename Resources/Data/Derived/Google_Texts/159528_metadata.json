He pleaded not guilty and was released on a $5 million bail.\n\n\u201cThere are many ways he would have to give [the album] up,\u201d Kloster said, \u201ceither through civil forfeiture under state and federal law, criminal forfeiture under state and federal law, or restitution claims against him.\u201d\n\nIf the government did find that Shkreli used ill-gotten gains to purchase the album\u2014and law enforcement subsequently seized it\u2014the proceeds would likely go into the Justice Department\u2019s asset forfeiture fund, Kloster said.\n\nDuring a news conference yesterday, U.S. Attorney Robert Capers said law enforcement hadn\u2019t yet seized the Wu-Tang Clan album.\n\n\u201cI wondered how long it was going to take to get to that,\u201d Capers said. \u201cWe\u2019re not aware of where he got the funds that he raised to buy the Wu-Tang Clan album.\u201d\n\nThe FBI confirmed that the album was not in their custody.\n\n#Breaking no seizure warrant at the arrest of Martin Shkreli today, which means we didn't seize the Wu-Tang Clan album. \u2014 FBI New York (@NewYorkFBI) December 17, 2015\n\nHowever, court documents suggest that the government is prepared to seek forfeiture of property \u201cderived from proceeds traceable to\u201d his allegations should Shkreli be convicted.\n\nIn recent years, law enforcement has gotten a bad reputation for its use of civil forfeiture, which gives them the power to seize property if they suspect it\u2019s tied to a crime. Abuses of the tool have been well documented.\n\nHowever, Kloster said the government would be using civil forfeiture for its intended purpose if they do seize the Wu-Tang Clan album.\n\n\u201cIf it was a case where [civil forfeiture] is appropriate, it\u2019s a case like this where someone steals from someone else and uses the money the purchase something,\u201d Kloster said. \u201cThe government should have the ability to take those assets, to liquidate those assets and make them whole.\u201d\n\nShkreli gained notoriety after he raised the price for the medication Daraprim from $13.50 to $750. His decision, which also landed his company under investigation by the Senate\u2019s Special Committee on Aging, garnered intense backlash from consumers and the media, alike.\n\nShkreli only fanned the flames when he told attendees at the Forbes Healthcare Summit earlier this month that, if he could\u2019ve done one thing differently, he would\u2019ve raised the price of Daraprim higher.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Martin Shkreli was arrested yesterday, and legal experts say law enforcement could use civil forfeiture to seize a Wu-Tang Clan album he purchased,", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Martin Shkreli was arrested yesterday, and legal experts say law enforcement could use civil forfeiture to seize a Wu-Tang Clan album he purchased,", "title": "Could Feds Use Forfeiture to Take Album From Pharma Boy?", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151218_WuTangForfeit_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-18T17:25:53+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1OcXAUv"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Martin Shkreli was arrested yesterday, and legal experts say law enforcement could use civil forfeiture to seize a Wu-Tang Clan album he purchased,", "title": "Could Feds Use Forfeiture to Take Album From Pharma Boy?", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151218_WuTangForfeit_Quinn.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "overcriminalization", "published_time": "2015-12-18T17:05:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-18T17:25:53+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Martin Shkreli, Wu-Tang Clan, civil asset forfeiture, Once Upon a Time in Shaolin, Daraprim, Turing Pharmaceuticals"}, "article_summary": "However, Kloster said the government would be using civil forfeiture for its intended purpose if they do seize the Wu-Tang Clan album.\nDuring a news conference yesterday, U.S. Attorney Robert Capers said law enforcement hadn\u2019t yet seized the Wu-Tang Clan album.\n#Breaking no seizure warrant at the arrest of Martin Shkreli today, which means we didn't seize the Wu-Tang Clan album.\nUsing civil asset forfeiture, state and federal law enforcement officials could seize the Wu-Tang Clan album, but they would first have to connect it to Shkreli\u2019s criminal activity.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not aware of where he got the funds that he raised to buy the Wu-Tang Clan album.\u201dThe FBI confirmed that the album was not in their custody."}
