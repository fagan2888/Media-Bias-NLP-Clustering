Ten people were transported to hospitals with minor injuries after a car crash in Grand Prairie Saturday.

But police said the accident could have been more serious because the minivan involved was carrying one adult and 14 children, none of whom were wearing seat belts.

Just before noon, a car ran a red light on West Polo Road and collided into the minivan traveling northbound on Lake Ridge Parkway.

The van was only equipped with two seats, including the driver’s, so most of the children were not sitting on a seat nor wearing seat belts, said Lyle Gensler, a spokesman for Grand Prairie police.

The accident “had all the makings to be horrific,” he said.

The minivan driver told police he and the children had gone swimming at Joe Pool Lake before the accident.

The driver of the minivan will likely face charges for the passengers travelling without seat belts, Gensler said.

“He might want to rethink doing that next time and maybe take three cars instead of one,” Gensler said.

The driver who ran the red light stopped to help the injured children get out of the minivan. He admitted to running a red light, and will likely face charges, too, Gensler said.
