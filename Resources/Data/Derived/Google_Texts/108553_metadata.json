Together, we bring home about $7,000 a month, and we\u2019d really like to buy a house soon. Right now we have about $10,000 in debt on a boat along with ongoing stable bills, food and upkeep for our three horses. What price range of houses should we look at in our situation?\n\n\u2014 Michelle\n\nDear Michelle,\n\nHomeownership is a great goal, but first you two need to clean up your debt and build an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses. After that, I want you to save up enough for a down payment of at least 10 to 20 percent.\n\nWhen buying a home on a mortgage, I always recommend the monthly payments be no more than 25 percent of your monthly take-home pay on a 15-year, fixed-rate loan.\n\nNow, let\u2019s get to the other issues: You have some things in your life that are pulling at you financially. At some point, you may have to take a long look at the situation and ask the hard question, \u201cWhat is more important to me: horses and boats or home ownership?\u201d\n\nGetting rid of that boat, or finding new homes for one, two or all of your horses, would bring in some cash to put toward your debt and cut down on at least some of the animal maintenance.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s how I would look at it. My wife and I both are big fans of boats and horses. But we like boats more. One reason is because they don\u2019t eat as much!\n\nI can\u2019t get mad at you about either one, but right now you\u2019ve got three things pulling at you as financial priorities \u2014 home ownership, a boat and three horses. They\u2019re all pulling at you, and they\u2019re pulling at each other and limiting each other.\n\nOf course, you can always buy a lot less of a house. But what it really comes down to is what\u2019s most important to you.\n\nThat\u2019s the big question, and it\u2019s one that only you can answer.\n\n\u2014 Dave Ramsey", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "advise, dave ramsey, economy, finance, homebuyer", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.jacobsmedia.KTAR", "og": {"site_name": "KTAR.com", "description": "Before making a big purchase, such as a home, it's important to decide where your financial priorities lie.", "title": "Dave Ramsey: You have to decide on your financial priorities", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/financial-decisions-ramsey-.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-05T14:25:29+00:00", "url": "http://ktar.com/story/837842/dave-ramsey-you-have-to-decide-on-your-financial-priorities/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "KTAR.com", "description": "Before making a big purchase, such as a home, it's important to decide where your financial priorities lie.", "title": "Dave Ramsey: You have to decide on your financial priorities", "image": "http://ktar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/financial-decisions-ramsey-.jpg", "creator": "@ktar923", "site": "@ktar923", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=719630055", "fb": {"pages": 42794977621, "app_id": 291385034204941}, "keywords": "Phoenix and Arizona Breaking News And News Headlines - Home, Home,92.3 KTAR", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/KTARNews", "section": "Dave Ramsey", "tag": "homebuyer", "published_time": "2016-01-09T07:24:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-05T14:25:29+00:00"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "verify-v1": "XrJiQDsWmPaoqGKN0EHKs7ult0rBB0W9zj4cWkAPRVI=", "viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Before making a big purchase, such as a home, it's important to decide where your financial priorities lie."}, "article_summary": "They\u2019re all pulling at you, and they\u2019re pulling at each other and limiting each other.\nI can\u2019t get mad at you about either one, but right now you\u2019ve got three things pulling at you as financial priorities \u2014 home ownership, a boat and three horses.\nRight now we have about $10,000 in debt on a boat along with ongoing stable bills, food and upkeep for our three horses.\nNow, let\u2019s get to the other issues: You have some things in your life that are pulling at you financially.\nAfter that, I want you to save up enough for a down payment of at least 10 to 20 percent."}
