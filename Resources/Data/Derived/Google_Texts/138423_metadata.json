North Carolina, which saw the passing of anti-trans HB 2 last month, has received an ultimatum from the Department of Justice saying that if they don\u2019t repeal the law, they will lose $861 million in federal education funding.\n\nAside from the loss of federal funds, there would also be a significant negative economic impact on business and tourism in Washington, as is currently being experienced in North Carolina.\n\nThe study makes it clear: I-1515 is a heinous measure, one that aims to strip trans people of their rights and would greatly damage Washington\u2019s economy in the process.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Washington set to lose billions in federal funding if they pass an anti-trans initiative this fall.", "og": {"site_name": "LOGO News", "description": "Devastating losses on the horizon for the Evergreen state.", "title": "How An Anti-Trans Measure Could Cost Washington State $4.5 Billion", "url": "http://www.newnownext.com/how-an-anti-trans-measure-could-cost-washington-state-4-5-billion/05/2016/", "image": {"width": 1440, "identifier": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:uma:image:logotv.com:11655721?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=1440&height=810&.jpg", "height": 810}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.newnownext.com/how-an-anti-trans-measure-could-cost-washington-state-4-5-billion/05/2016/", "image": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:uma:image:logotv.com:11655721?quality=0.8&format=jpg&width=500&height=375", "description": "Washington set to lose billions in federal funding if they pass an anti-trans initiative this fall.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How An Anti-Trans Measure Could Cost Washington State $4.5 Billion"}, "sm4": {"category": "News Articles - News", "parent": "mgid:wordpress:siteloc:www.newnownext.com:hp", "pubdate": "2016-05-09 12:02:34 PM +0000", "creator": "20D502000002D52000010002D520", "author": "Cody Gohl", "alias": "post", "mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:www.newnownext.com:433862", "type": "post"}, "fb": {"admins": "unset", "app_id": "unset"}, "ao": {"mgid": "mgid:wordpress:post:www.newnownext.com:433862"}, "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "MTVNVevoHelper": {"beacon": "D4F4BE78-454E-44C3-B142-F9D269B9303E"}, "thumbnail": "http://logoonline.mtvnimages.com/uri/mgid:file:http:shared:newnownext.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/GettyImages-103119392-1462794278-300x193.jpg?quality=0.8&format=jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5810\"", "article_summary": "A new study shows that an anti-trans ballot initiative out of Washington could potentially cost the state over $4.5 billion in federal funding.\nThe loss of funding would be catastrophic for Washington and would certainly become a reality should the initiative be put on a ballot and passed in November.\nAside from the loss of federal funds, there would also be a significant negative economic impact on business and tourism in Washington, as is currently being experienced in North Carolina.\nThe study makes it clear: I-1515 is a heinous measure, one that aims to strip trans people of their rights and would greatly damage Washington\u2019s economy in the process.\nNorth Carolina, which saw the passing of anti-trans HB 2 last month, has received an ultimatum from the Department of Justice saying that if they don\u2019t repeal the law, they will lose $861 million in federal education funding."}
