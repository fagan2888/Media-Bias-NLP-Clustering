Gov. Jerry Brown appointed her in late 2010. A native of Hanford, she earlier served as president and CEO of the California Children\u2019s Hospital Assn. She worked for Brown during his first administration.\n\nShe sat down for an interview with Deborah Schoch, a senior writer for the CHCF Center for Health Reporting. Here is an edited version of their conversation.\n\nQ: Do you think that Kaiser Permanente, which started in California, is emerging as the model that we\u2019re moving to with the Affordable Care Act?\n\nDooley: Moving to coordinated care is at the heart of the Affordable Care Act. So I wouldn\u2019t say Kaiser, per se, but Kaiser did this out of its own needs during World War II in the shipyards, where it was providing care to its workers because it needed workers. And investing in them holistically. You\u2019ve got people who are a part of your team. And the team provides care when you need it and health incentives when you don\u2019t. And if we can all do that, it will cost less. So that was the fundamental principle.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be in a position of endorsing any one model or another by name, but the concept of creating a plan of care that treats the whole person and is invested in health instead of in treatment, is what is revolutionary, I think, about the Affordable Care Act.\n\nQ: Medi-Cal\u2019s reimbursement rates in California are among the lowest in the nation. Has that thrown the supply of Medi-Cal providers out of whack?\n\nDooley: We have 70 percent of our Medi-Cal population in managed care. No other state comes even close to that number. Which argues for our efficiency, that we\u2019re managing the care. For example, it may be that fewer of our people need to go to the doctor. If we\u2019re paying our providers on a capitated basis, and our plans are managing their care, we are getting value. We\u2019re paying less for the health of our Medi-Cal beneficiaries.\n\nQ: Since Jan. 1, Medi-Cal has seen twice the number of enrollees as Covered California. Given the enrollment problems, do you think you\u2019re expanding it more than you should at this point?\n\nDooley: [Laughs] We didn\u2019t have an option to expand. I mean, the federal law is: If you\u2019re eligible, you get the coverage. We exceeded our most optimistic projections of enrollment\u2014at Covered California, and with Medi-Cal. And so we are in the position of dancing as fast as we can to catch up and accommodate this. We had childless adults who had no care at all. All of those people flooding into the system\u2014there is going to be a pretty significant period of adjustment. And I think, despite the frustration and anxiety of people who weren\u2019t able to get their enrollment confirmed.... This was the first time, maybe in their lifetime, that they had even the hope of getting coverage. And we\u2019re getting them. Any reasonable person would look at this and say, we\u2019re not going to snap our fingers and, you know, turn the lights on. We\u2019re going to have to work through this, and we are.\n\nQ: The ACA operates on the principle that everyone must be covered for quality of care to go up and costs go down. The exclusion of undocumented immigrants means a large chunk of people will go uninsured. What do you think should happen?\n\nDooley: We clearly need comprehensive immigration reform. But it\u2019s fundamentally a federal issue. And the Affordable Care Act left them out altogether. We\u2019re very busy making what we\u2019ve already done work. It breaks my heart to see people who have needs that we can\u2019t meet.\n\nQ: You\u2019ve said we\u2019re in this season of disruption, and you\u2019ve described it as an in-between stage that morphs into something else. Where is it morphing to?\n\nDooley: Well, I hope and believe that by focusing on health and outcomes and not procedures and unit costs of care, we can become, as I set as a goal in 2012 with our \u201cLet\u2019s Get Healthy, California\u201d work, the healthiest state in the nation by 2022. That\u2019s sort of the North Star for me.\n\nAnd I think focusing on health, and creating payment systems and delivery systems that are incentivized for people to be healthy\u2014and that happens when you have team approaches and payments that are on a per-person basis, so that you are looking for ways for people to be healthy, and not ways to be reimbursed for their illness\u2014you can get to that state of health.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe54\"", "article_summary": "Dooley: Moving to coordinated care is at the heart of the Affordable Care Act.\nAnd the Affordable Care Act left them out altogether.\nQ: Since Jan. 1, Medi-Cal has seen twice the number of enrollees as Covered California.\nQ: Do you think that Kaiser Permanente, which started in California, is emerging as the model that we\u2019re moving to with the Affordable Care Act?\nWe exceeded our most optimistic projections of enrollment\u2014at Covered California, and with Medi-Cal."}
