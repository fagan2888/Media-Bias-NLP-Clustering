Menzies learned pretty early that life will go on without you.\n\nA near-death experience will do that to a person.\n\nAt age 27, the Getzville native spent nearly three months in a coma, during a severe bout of pneumonia.\n\n\u201cHaving to lay in a hospital bed and having to let go very quickly, you realize that the world is going on without your help, and the only thing you can hope is that people are making good decisions\u201d on your behalf, Menzies said. \"We have to realize that there\u2019s a time where we have to let go. You want to have good people in place, and good discussions about what would make you happy.\u201d\n\nI had a wide-ranging interview earlier this week with Menzies about her job as an elder law attorney in Cheektowaga, her interest in creating a center on aging in Western New York and what it was like as the primary caregiver to her elderly parents during the last four years of their lives.\n\nA chunk of that interview is contained in today\u2019s In the Field feature in WNY Refresh, but the topic of the last years of someone\u2019s life \u2013 and the importance of planning for them \u2013 is so vast, and Menzies\u2019 comments were so illuminating, that I wanted to offer more of them in this blog posting.\n\nThe bottom line comes down to lots more than money, but let\u2019s start there.\n\nNursing home care across the region costs about $400 a day.\n\nYou can stay at the Waldorf Astoria for less.\n\n\u201cPeople tell me all the time, \u2018My father never spent more than $150 a night on a hotel room,\u2019\u201d Menzies said. \u201cTo save your whole life and then having to open your wallet that way is painful.\u201d\n\nMenzies told me that the long-term care system in the U.S. has become so convoluted that an overhaul is in order. She also pointed to the unlikely political and financial realities of that:\n\nCongress and the president tried to include long-term care reform in the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) but decided that this section of the proposed law was so complex and divisive, it was removed from the final bill.\n\nThose who oversee and run the long-term care system have been able to make it work enough for their benefit, so have decided to evolve with system rather than push for broader change.\n\n\u201cThe problem with getting to a new system is that everybody needs to get paid,\u201d Menzies said, \u201cso everybody is immediately OK with the system that we have and tries to maximize their profits within that framework.\u201d\n\nMenzies recommends that an elder care lawyer walk someone through this maze of bureaucracy, though she\u2019d rather see a system where an \u201caging coach\u201d can help pull together the medical, legal, financial and social sides.\n\nShe also recently published a book, \u201cEmbracing Elderhood,\u201d and created a website, embracingelderhood.com, that can begin to help people understand what documents and planning needs to be in place long before mom, dad, spouse \u2013 or you \u2013 need to make decisions about whether to go into a nursing home or spend your infirm years at home, what end-of-life directives are needed, and who is going to pay for it all.\n\n\u201cNew York has gone to managed care,\u201d Menzies said, \u201cso people are trying to figure out how to best work within that system. That system is broken. Maybe Medicare needs to pay for some part of caregiving, decide that it\u2019s part of our aging process, that it\u2019s not unnatural as part of someone\u2019s care.\n\n\u201cMy argument goes like this: The part of the care you need if you have kidney failure is dialysis and that\u2019s covered by Medicare because it\u2019s part of your physical needs. If you have a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s, the need for that would be caregiving \u2013 people watching you so you don\u2019t walk away and get lost. Medicare doesn\u2019t cover that. Why not? That\u2019s the treatment for this type of disease.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s where things leave baby boomers, most of whom have dealt with plugging their parents into the elder care system \u2013 and will enter the system themselves in the next decade or three: in a very confusing, uncomfortable and expensive place.\n\nThe numbers alone can be daunting.\n\nIf you or a loved one will spend an extended time in a nursing home, chances are good the Medicaid system will come into play.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve accumulated half a million dollars between your pension, your house, your savings,\u201d Menzies said. \u201cI will tell you that the government\u2019s plan for paying for long-term care is that you spend everything you have down to $15,000 and then they will pick up. Medicare doesn\u2019t pay for this stuff. Medicaid is for impoverishment so you\u2019ve got to fit into their guidelines. \u2026 Otherwise, it\u2019s all up to you. That\u2019s why a lot of people are stingy and don\u2019t ask for help. They\u2019re trying to save and scrimp for their kids, who are 70 years old and don\u2019t need help, don\u2019t need the money. So a lot of it is talking our way through this.\n\n\u201cFor example, you have saved $500,000, but will spend all of it down and that doesn\u2019t seem fair when the guy next to you has $50,000,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you feel that\u2019s not right and you\u2019ve taken time and effort to accumulate all that money, then you should think about protecting some.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s say you took your house and $100,000 and preserved $300,000. You\u2019ll say, \u2018I\u2019ll spend $200,000 on my care but I have some say in what happens to the rest of my estate. That\u2019s what an irrevocable trust would be for.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t want to be bothered figuring these things out when you\u2019re in sound body, mind and spirit? Just can\u2019t handle the thought of talking to your parents about their deaths, or your children about your own?\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t plan with your money or your documents, then the government or a nursing home is going to control how much it\u2019s going to cost you through your old age,\u201d Menzies said. \u201cIf we can get through some of this personal stuff, then we\u2019re free to laugh and tell jokes. My dad pretty much trusted that his daughter had everything under control. Not a lot of people have that kind of security.\u201d\n\nMenzies gets the wariness about lawyers. Her father, Bill, a retired Williamsville Post Office clerk, wasn\u2019t delighted when his youngest daughter returned to Western New York in the late 1990s with plans to attend University at Buffalo Law School.\n\nBut in the last years of her parents\u2019 lives, Menzies said, both of them were thankful for the \u201chappy accident\u201d the couple had 23 years into the marriage with the birth of a third child who became a lawyer \u2013 and then moved in next door.\n\nHer parents learned, said Menzies, that lawyers who specialize in elder care generally are worth the time, trouble and expense. They can help blunt the financial brunt of long-term care, make sure that documents are in place to direct hospital and nursing home care, and ease the showdowns that can happen when family members swoop in from far-flung places during a time of crisis.\n\n\u201cI have really good results when people want to talk about this and want to get this stuff moving,\u201d Menzies said. \u201cEven if we don\u2019t come to a full conclusion, we know how much money there is, we know where it is, and maybe we\u2019ve preserved some. We don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to play out ... but it gives people some peace of mind.\u201d\n\nThat meant a lot to Bill and Dorothy Menzies, who were married 70 years.\n\n\u201cThey were both very active,\u201d their youngest daughter said. \u201cMy mother was selling Avon until she was 86. She sold it for 53 years. After he retired, my dad enjoyed going by himself in the morning to coffee shops, flirting with the girls and telling jokes. They had friends and through their 80s they were still having parties. On New Year\u2019s, I would go to bed and they would still be up.\n\n\u201cMy dad\u2019s balance started to go after age 91. He was just less steady. He\u2019d fallen a couple times at home. We loved to go the Bisons games, and during one of the games we looked over and he was on the ground. The tests came to no result. My husband (ER doctor David James) at that point said, \u2018He has TMB\u2019: Too Many Birthdays. He just let me know that at some point, our bodies just wear down. Something wasn\u2019t working so well. I was on vacation in Greece when someone called and said Daddy had fallen. ... He had a hematoma on his head and they had to take him to a hospital. After Gates, they discharged him to rehab. They had to at this point.\n\n\u201cThis is where reality starts to hit. Then my mother needs a ride over to Weinberg to see him . She\u2019s too afraid to drive because she\u2019s so upset about him being sick. She wanted to spend the whole day with him. When people are married 67, 68 years at that point, they can\u2019t imagine not being there. You get the frustrations of people not being used to institutional care. The alarm that happens that if dad gets up, is he going to fall? The frustration that he\u2019s got to go to the bathroom and nobody comes when he calls. You start to realize, \u2018What am my going to do?\u2019\n\n\u201cI had to talk to my parents about whether or not they would accept some aides in the house. At first, my mother was like, \u2018This is my house.\u2019 She didn\u2019t want someone else cooking for my father or knowing their business. But once we got them in, my mother totally took to it like duck to water. She\u2019d say, \u2018What are you going to make for dinner tonight, Kathy? Can you make us another pie?\u2019\n\n\u201cWe ended up having a really great relationship with the aides. We were grateful to have people helping, so we had a good attitude. You don\u2019t act like they\u2019re your servant. They\u2019re helping you do what you want to do: stay home.\"\n\nBill Menzies gave up his car keys after the falls started, and had trouble walking the last three years of his life. He spent many of his days drawing comic strips. One drawing included the words: \u201cMoney doesn\u2019t bring you happiness. The beer truck brings you happiness.\u201d Another read, \u201cMy veins are too close together. I have very close veins;\u201d another, \u201cI\u2019m getting married again. That\u2019s like breaking into prison.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe couldn\u2019t walk anymore but he could still make people laugh. That\u2019s what made him happy,\u201d his daughter said.\n\nHe died at in July 2012 at 96, of pneumonia, after a year at home on hospice care.\n\n\u201cIt was up to him,\u201d his daughter said. \u201cHe liked watching the Yankees and telling jokes every day and I liked having him on the Earth, so I wasn\u2019t in any rush.\u201d\n\nMenzies\u2019 mother died at home in February 2013, at 89, from a rare form of Parkinson\u2019s disease.\n\n\u201cMom used to say he\u2019d better not die first,\u201d Laurie Menzies recalled. \u201cHe did everything she wanted. He was seven years older though. I know he lived longer than he wanted. He didn\u2019t want to leave her alone...\n\n\u201cA lot of my friends at 50 or 60 will say \u2018Shoot me if I can\u2019t do this or that when I\u2019m old,\u2019\u201d Menzies added. \u201cWhat I\u2019d like to say is, \u2018What about not just the physical parts?\n\n\u201cWhen we look at each other as ageless spirits, not just aging bodies, then we start to recognize how difficult it can be to start losing the things we used to be able to do and find ourselves giving this compassion. What I didn\u2019t realize is how much you get from giving your time, your love, to other people.\u201d\n\nemail: refresh@buffnews.com\n\nTwitter: @BNrefresh", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "Refresh Buffalo Blog", "description": "Laurie L.
