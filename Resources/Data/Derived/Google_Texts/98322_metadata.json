The research, published online in the International Journal of Medical Informatics, analyzed 100 patient visits with primary care doctors. During the time that doctors were using the computers, patients looked around the room, sometimes trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to get their doctor\u2019s attention, the report found. \u201cThat\u2019s time that they\u2019re not engaging with the patient,\u201d says Enid Montague, lead author of the study and an assistant professor in medicine and engineering at Northwestern University.\n\nTypically, doctors using paper charts would quickly review a patient\u2019s information outside of the examination room, leaving them with more time to visually examine a patient and chat about how they\u2019re feeling, says Montague. Now, doctors using electronic records are spending a portion of the time they would normally spend with patients reviewing their medical records and typing in any relevant updates. Many patients stared at the computer screens along with their doctors, but couldn\u2019t understand what they were looking at, she says.\n\nWhile the study didn\u2019t find that doctors skipped any steps during their examinations, Montague says some doctors may have missed out on the nonverbal cues that usually help them recognize a new health issue like depression. Those first few minutes of a doctor\u2019s visit, typically filled with chitchat about how a patient is feeling, as well as questions about whether the person has gone on any trips recently and how his or her children are doing, are vital to helping doctors get to know their patients, says Montague. That rapport helps doctors gain their patients\u2019 trust, which can in turn make patients more willing to take needed medications or make recommended lifestyle changes, she adds.\n\nBook your doctor's appointment now (2:14) If you need to have a checkup with your doctor you might want to think about booking the appointment now.

In hospitals, doctors using computers to order prescriptions risk ordering information for the wrong patient or entering medical information under the wrong name, says Heather Farley, lead author of a 2013 report on the quality and safety implications of emergency-department information systems published in the \u201cAnnals of Emergency Medicine.\u201d Some critics of electronic medical records also warn about \u201calert fatigue,\u201d where doctors receive so many updates, they risk missing an important change to a patient\u2019s condition. \u201cI think we are just scratching the surface,\u201d says Dr. Farley of the issues that could arise from digital medical records.\n\nTo be sure, doctors say the move to electronic health records can improve patient safety overall by reducing paperwork and giving doctors instant access to prior test results, prescription information and records for care received in other settings, such as the emergency room, says Montague. Electronic records also remove the issue of poor handwriting, making it easier for doctors to read important information. And some systems can alert doctors to allergies or potentially risky drug interactions.\n\nSome doctors may get more out of their electronic health systems by designing a program that allows patients to review their medical information along with the doctor during a visit, says Montague, a change that might still allow doctors to build rapport with patients while they go over necessary information. Hospitals are working to avoid mix-ups by including more identifying information in a patient\u2019s digital chart, such as a photo or a room number. \u201cWe can improve the design so that physicians can engage in these other nonverbal communications more effectively,\u201d says Montague.\n\nMore must-reads from MarketWatch:\n\nLife to get more miserable, expensive for smokers\n\n10 things emergency rooms won\u2019t tell you\n\nWill February at doctor be like January at gym?\n\nMore from MarketWatch", "article_metadata": {"lifp_basePath": "https://id.marketwatch.com/access", "twitter": {"site": {"id": 624413}, "domain": "marketwatch.com", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BP634_doctor_MG_20131121111932.jpg", "height": 398}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "A study shows doctors using electronic records interact less with their patients."}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "parsely-author": "Jonnelle Marte", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-01-28T08:00:00-05:00", "parsely-link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-your-doctor-should-put-down-the-ipad-2014-01-28", "author": "Jonnelle Marte", "parsely-title": "Why your doctor should put down the iPad", "description": "A study shows doctors using electronic records interact less with their patients.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "page.site": "marketwatch", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "parsely-section": "MW_Personal Finance", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "og": {"site_name": "MarketWatch", "description": "A study shows doctors using electronic records interact less with their patients.", "title": "Why your doctor should put down the iPad", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-your-doctor-should-put-down-the-ipad-2014-01-28", "image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BP634_doctor_MG_20131121111932.jpg", "type": "article"}, "ob": {"image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-BP634_doctor_MG_20131121111932.jpg"}, "article.id": "2D40F108-8777-11E3-9C8B-00212803FAD6", "position": 1}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd142e\"", "article_summary": "\u201cI think we are just scratching the surface,\u201d says Dr. Farley of the issues that could arise from digital medical records.\nThe research was similar to other reports showing that the move to electronic medical records, which is being accelerated by the Affordable Care Act, can have unintended consequences.\nNow, doctors using electronic records are spending a portion of the time they would normally spend with patients reviewing their medical records and typing in any relevant updates.\nMore must-reads from MarketWatch:Life to get more miserable, expensive for smokers10 things emergency rooms won\u2019t tell youWill February at doctor be like January at gym?\nBook your doctor's appointment now (2:14) If you need to have a checkup with your doctor you might want to think about booking the appointment now."}
