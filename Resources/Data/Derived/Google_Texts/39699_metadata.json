That is why the two navigators will be traveling around the county, including on nights and weekends, to advise individuals and businesses about the process and the available options.\n\nThe state Department of Health grant is requiring three full days of training for the navigators, who will be hired based in part on their experience and responsibility in related fields. The navigators will have had some online assignments before their formal training begins, and once that\u2019s done, they will have to take and pass a test \u201cbefore they\u2019re cleared as navigators,\u201d Fishbeck said.\n\nThe navigators\u2019 presentations will begins soon, and the real work, for them and for those shopping for insurance, begins in October when the \u201cexchange\u201d opens and choosing plans begins.\n\nThe ACA requires navigators to educate the public with fair and impartial information about health plans, premium tax credits, and cost-sharing reduction payments, and to facilitate enrollment in qualified health plans.\n\nThe Health Initiative staff will work one-on-one with people applying for health insurance for the first time and at annual renewal time; explain the variety of insurance programs available through the exchange; help with private and public health insurance programs, advance premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions; and help those with grievances, complaints or questions about health coverage find resolution with other agencies.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ll have a lot of education to do,\u201d Fishbeck said. They are waiting for materials from the state with details of the processes involved.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be getting staff hired and trained and prepared to answer questions accurately, so we would prefer it if people don\u2019t call us with questions yet. First, we want to get the most current and accurate information. The only thing worse than no information is the wrong information,\u201d Fishbeck said.\n\nShe said particular attention will be paid \u201cto the work with small businesses because they have a different \u2018portal,\u2019 the Shop Exchange, for companies with 50 employees or fewer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe want to be sure that all areas in St. Lawrence County have access to in-person enrollment assistance,\u201d said the Health Initiative\u2019s Anne Marie Snell, who will be administering the navigators program in St. Lawrence County. \u201cTherefore, our navigators will be on the road across the county during the day, evening, and on Saturdays,\u201d Snell said.\n\nA full schedule of presentations will be posted at the Initiative\u2019s website, www.gethealthyslc.org, and at the website of the New York Health Benefit Exchange, www.healthbenefitexchange.ny.gov. The Initiative will begin scheduling appointments for in-person assistance with enrollment on Sept. 15.\n\nThere will be more information on their website in September, Fishbeck said, and people will be able to make appointments online or by phone.\n\nPresentations to groups can be arranged by contacting Snell at 261-4760, ext. 222, or anne@gethealthyslc.org.", "article_metadata": {"Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3188\"", "article_summary": "By CRAIG FREILICHSigning up for health care insurance under the Affordable Care Act \u2013 \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2013 begins this fall, but St. Lawrence County residents will have help getting through the new potentially arduous and confusing process.\nThe only thing worse than no information is the wrong information,\u201d Fishbeck said.\nThe ACA requires navigators to educate the public with fair and impartial information about health plans, premium tax credits, and cost-sharing reduction payments, and to facilitate enrollment in qualified health plans.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, a lot of people are not aware of what\u2019s required under quite a variety of plans through the Health Benefits Exchange,\u201d she said.\nThe navigators will have had some online assignments before their formal training begins, and once that\u2019s done, they will have to take and pass a test \u201cbefore they\u2019re cleared as navigators,\u201d Fishbeck said."}
