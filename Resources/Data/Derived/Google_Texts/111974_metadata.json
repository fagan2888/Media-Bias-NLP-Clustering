Health First Medical Group will be out-of-network April for people with UnitedHealthcare insurance. That means higher fees if patients want to keep seeing a Health First Medical Group doctor.\n\nThe insurance company said it\u2019s working on a performance-based contract where doctors would get more money, but would also be rewarded for quality and patient outcomes.\n\n\u201cWe continue to meet regularly and remain hopeful Health First\u2019s physicians will renew their participation in UnitedHealthcare\u2019s network,\u201d wrote Keely Brenno, \u200edirector of public relations for UnitedHealthcare.\n\nIf there\u2019s no deal, though, UnitedHealthcare patients with special health care needs, such as end-stage kidney failure, chemotherapy and radiation, may be able to apply to get in-network prices for a special transition period.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope and desire to reach an agreement with UnitedHealthcare before the deadline, so their members will continue to have in-network access to high quality health care,\u201d wrote Matthew Gerrell, vice president of marketing for Health First. \u201cIt should be noted that this negotiation only involves our medical group, as we currently have an agreement with our hospitals.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nReporter Abe Aboraya is part of WMFE in Orlando.
