From claims that DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz has been “working against” Sen. Bernie Sanders from the “get-go” to accusations that she’s “always had her finger on the scale for Hillary Clinton,” many Democrats have been frustrated by what they deem has been a very undemocratic primary process.

Van Jones, one of the latest outspoken critics against the Democratic Party chair, has had enough. He’s so frustrated, in fact, that he’d prefer to have Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus running the show.

Speaking to CNN’s Brooke Baldwin about the failure of leadership in both wings of the party, Jones said Wasserman Schultz ought to be “the umpire” or “marriage counselor.”

Instead, she’s “coming in harder for Hillary Clinton,” which amounts to “malpractice,” he added.

“I wish Reince Priebus was my party chair,” Jones lamented. “He did a better job of handling the Trump situation than I’ve seen my party chair handle this situation and I’m ashamed to say that.”
