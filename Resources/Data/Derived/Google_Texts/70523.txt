After a two-year incubation period and competitive selection process, the 40 West Arts District in Lakewood has been certified into the Colorado Creative District program.

The certification was awarded by Colorado Creative Industries and the Boettcher Foundation.

“This is a tremendous accomplishment for our community … we will share more detailed information in the coming days about the benefits and impact of becoming a state-certified creative district for the West Colfax Corridor,” wrote 40 West director Bill Marino in an email. “Needless to say, we are thrilled and grateful!!”

Colorado Creative Industries is a division of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade, part of legislation signed by Gov. John Hickenlooper in 2011.

By naming creative districts, the intent is to ignite creative entrepreneurship and innovation in communities by providing funding, professional assistance, training and networking opportunities.

“These 2014 certified and candidate creative districts are great examples of how the arts create exciting places for people to visit and live,” Hickenlooper said in a statement. “These districts not only increase quality of life, they also help with economic vitality of the area and attract people from all over Colorado and the country.

Even after the two-year program, final certification is not guaranteed. 40 West was one of seven districts vying for four spots. The four will receive $20,000 and long-term support in helping 40 West thrive, said Colorado Creative Industries director Margaret Hunt.

Also certified this year was downtown Colorado Springs, Denver’s RiNo Art District and the Greeley Creative District. They’ll join seven existing districts that have been certified by Colorado Creative Industries.

Seven candidate districts were also selected to begin the two-year incubation program, including the Evergreen Creative District.
