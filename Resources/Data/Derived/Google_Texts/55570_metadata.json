The following is taken from her talk with Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer.\n\nMarianne Schnall: Why do you think it is that we\u2019ve not had a woman president so far?\n\nSheryl Sandberg: I have a great story for you. There\u2019s a song that has all the names of the presidents, and so my kids were learning the names of all the presidents and my daughter, at four, looked at me, and her first question was, \u201cMommy, why are they all boys?\u201d\n\nI think women in leadership suffer from stereotyping, and when people expect a stereotype and are reminded of a stereotype, that actually makes the stereotype stronger. It\u2019s called stereotype threat, and it\u2019s why when women check off \u201cMiss\u201d or girls check off \u201cFemale\u201d before taking a math test, the research shows they actually do worse. What has happened is that there aren\u2019t women in leadership roles, therefore people don\u2019t expect there to be women in leadership roles, therefore, there aren\u2019t women in leadership roles.\n\nMS: What can we do to change that?\n\nSS: It starts young. Girls are discouraged from leading at an early age. The word \u201cbossy\u201d is largely applied to girls, not boys. I think we need to expect and encourage our girls and women to lead and contribute. And I think we are so focused on supporting what we call \u201cchoice,\u201d that we don\u2019t mean real choice. When we say choice, we mean women get to choose to work or have families. We don\u2019t mean men choose to work or have families. Real choice would mean that people were choosing based on their interests and personal passions, not based on their gender.\n\nMS: There is also the impact of how we treat women leaders. For example, some of the sexist commentary when Hillary was running, or some of the comments that are always made about women leaders like Nancy Pelosi. When women are in positions of power, or seen as confident or ambitious, they\u2019re often portrayed as unlikable.\n\nSS: They are un-liked. As a woman gets more successful, she is less liked by people of both genders, and as a man gets more successful, he does not take a likability hit.\n\nMS: Where is the entry for change? Is it in the media? Is it in our educational systems? Where can we fix some of these problems?\n\nSS: It\u2019s the classic chicken-and-egg problem. We need more women leaders to show more women they can lead \u2026 and we need to show more women they can lead to get more women leaders. I think the first thing we need to do is decide that the status quo is not okay. When I say women have been 15 percent or 16 percent of the leadership in corporate America for ten years and it hasn\u2019t moved, people are astonished: \u201cReally? It hasn\u2019t moved in ten years? We\u2019ve stopped making progress?\u201d\n\nSo the first thing is acknowledging there is a problem and deciding we want it to get better. In our society, we don\u2019t talk about gender, at all. I don\u2019t understand how you fix a problem if you can\u2019t acknowledge you have one.\n\nMS: One of the things in particular that I think affects the political sphere\u2014in terms of the dearth of women running for office\u2014is the fact that it\u2019s such a hostile, mud-slinging experience where candidates are subjected to so much criticism. Do you think that\u2019s part of the reason that sometimes women are deterred from entering politics, because women are less likely to want to subject themselves to that?\n\nSS: Yes, but also because women are less liked by running. It is all self-reinforcing, all of which we can change. I really believe we can change it. I think the dialogue on whether or not women can do it\u2014can we have it all\u2014is incredibly harmful. We need to recognize that we can\u2019t do it all, that we face trade-offs every single minute of the day. We have to stop beating ourselves up for not doing everything perfectly.\n\nMS: What I think is so important about what you bring into the whole equation is the connection between a woman\u2019s personal and family life, just the realities of balancing that and how that impacts this whole conversation. How do you see the influence of gender roles? Some of this is not just specific to women, but it involves men changing their gender roles as well, yet we rarely talk about it.\n\n\n\nSS: I know. I think that is a problem. We are stuck in our gender-specific roles and so it\u2019s just reinforcing. In my book, Lean In, I tell the story of my friend Sharon. She said that her daughter went to school, she was seven or something, and she was introducing her parents. She said, \u201cThis is Steve. He builds buildings and he loves to sing. This is Sharon,\u201d and she shows pictures of her parents, \u201cShe works full time. She wrote a book, and she never picks me up.\u201d Steve never picks her up! Sharon picks her up more than Steve, but that\u2019s what kids see.\n\nI wrote a lot in my book about being identified as Facebook\u2019s female COO, and I actually did a Google search for \u201cFacebook\u2019s male CEO\u201d and there are no results, zero. I don\u2019t wake up in the morning and say, \u201cWhat am I going to do today as Facebook\u2019s female COO?\u201d But that is how I\u2019m viewed by the world. I wrote at the end of my book, it\u2019s one of my favorite lines in the whole book, \u201cOne day there won\u2019t be \u2018female.\u2019\u201d The word \u201cfemale,\u201d when inserted in front of something, is always with a note of surprise. Female COO, female pilot, female surgeon\u2014as if the gender implies surprise, which it does. I am a female leader. One day there won\u2019t be female leaders. There will just be leaders. I personally think it\u2019s a numbers game. I basically think the system is broken and there are all kinds of institutional barriers, but if we can get enough women into jobs like yours and jobs like mine, that changes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Facebook's COO discusses why men still rule the highest levels of the professional ranks and how it can change", "title": "Sheryl Sandberg: \u201cMen need to do more childcare and housework\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Facebook's COO discusses why men still rule the highest levels of the professional ranks and how it can change", "title": "Sheryl Sandberg: \u201cMen need to do more childcare and housework\u201d", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/11/03/sheryl_sandberg_men_need_to_do_more_childcare_and_housework/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/sheryl_sandberg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Facebook's COO discusses why men still rule the highest levels of the professional ranks and how it can change", "title": "Sheryl Sandberg: \u201cMen need to do more childcare and housework\u201d", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/11/sheryl_sandberg.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Marianne Schnall", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Feminism, Inequality, presidency, Sheryl Sandberg, Women's right, Writers and Writing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6f9\"", "article_summary": "We need more women leaders to show more women they can lead \u2026 and we need to show more women they can lead to get more women leaders.\nWhat has happened is that there aren\u2019t women in leadership roles, therefore people don\u2019t expect there to be women in leadership roles, therefore, there aren\u2019t women in leadership roles.\nFemale COO, female pilot, female surgeon\u2014as if the gender implies surprise, which it does.\nFor example, some of the sexist commentary when Hillary was running, or some of the comments that are always made about women leaders like Nancy Pelosi.\nMS: There is also the impact of how we treat women leaders."}
