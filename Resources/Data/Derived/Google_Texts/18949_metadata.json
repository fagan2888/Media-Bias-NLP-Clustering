Ron Johnson (R-WI) waves to the crowd before speaking at the Conservative Political Action conference (CPAC), on February 10, 2011 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\n4208160\n\nRepublican Sen. Ron Johnson has introduced a bill that would require the Congressional Budget Office to score Obamacare\u2019s ultimate cost and effect on the federal deficit, after the CBO claimed earlier this week the health law had grown too complicated to score.\n\nThe \u201cTruth in Obamacare Accounting Act\u201d would require the CBO to continue to provide a full accounting of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s effect on federal deficits.\n\n\u201cNews this week has highlighted a real problem in how Congress accounts for this huge expansion of government health care spending,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cCBO undoubtedly faces considerable challenges in separating the impact of the law from some of the other programs that interact with it, but it can and should be able to estimate those costs and impacts so that Congress and the American people understand the true scope of financial harm that Obamacare is causing.\u201d\n\nThe CBO, which has been rating Obamacare\u2019s cost for years, announced in a footnote of an April report that it \u201ccan no longer determine exactly how the provisions of the ACA that are not related to the expansion of health insurance coverage have affected their projections of direct spending and revenues,\u201d Roll Call reported Wednesday.\n\nThe abdication sparked some experts\u2019 suspicions. Joseph Antos, a health-care expert at D.C. think tank the American Enterprise Institute, told Roll Call he doubted how the law could have changed enough since the CBO last scored its cost to make a cost analysis impossible.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t want to admit that what they assumed two years ago is no longer correct because the administration has not implemented many provisions of the law,\u201d Antos said.\n\nThe last time the CBO estimated Obamacare\u2019s cost, it still projected that the health-care law would reduce savings. It\u2019s unlikely a further report would turn out the same result. The CBO has admitted in several reports over the past year that the Obama administration\u2019s unilateral changes to the law will lower its revenue by billions.\n\nThe delay of the employer mandate will cost $3 billion in penalty payments by 2016, according to an April CBO report, and the administration\u2019s new \u201chardship exemptions\u201d will contribute to a loss of $3 billion in individual mandate penalties according to a Thursday CBO report.
