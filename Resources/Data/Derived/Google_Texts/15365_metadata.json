VA Secretary Bob McDonald will be the keynote speaker at an event, which will include elected officials.\n\nThe $620 million dollar facility broke ground seven years ago, and has been plagued with delays. The clinic began seeing patients in February, and the hospital will continue opening in phases through the rest of 2015.\n\nNavy veteran Tom Pokorski said the new facility is an improvement over the VA clinic at Lake Baldwin, which is old and over-crowded.\n\n\u201cLake Baldwin didn\u2019t necessarily have all the types of services,\u201d Pokorski said. \u201cIf you needed an MRI, you couldn\u2019t get it there, they\u2019d send you out somewhere in town to get it. But here it\u2019s all self contained. So it\u2019s kind of a one-stop shop type thing.\u201d\n\nThe new hospital is in the process of hiring hundreds, with the biggest demand for 500 nursing jobs. Check the slideshow for a look inside the hospital.\n\nAbe Aboraya is a reporter with WMFE in Orlando.
