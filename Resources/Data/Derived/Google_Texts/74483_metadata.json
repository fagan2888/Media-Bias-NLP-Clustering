Second, building tenants say there were no tax preparation businesses there for at least 17 years. In fact, records indicate DeHaven worked out of his house, not in the building that was bombed.\n\nOne of the tenants, the Colorado Springs chapter of the NAACP, believes it\u2019s far more likely that suspect Thaddeus Cheyenne Murphy was targeting his group instead.\n\nHenry Allen Jr., president of the Colorado Springs branch of the NAACP, said Murphy\u2019s professed motive is pocked with holes and appears to be a way to decrease a possible stiffer penalty.\n\nEven the timing of the Jan. 6 bombing seems to point to the NAACP office as being the target, Allen said. The office had taken a holiday break beginning Dec. 23. Office phone messages and a note posted on the door said it was to reopen on Jan. 6 \u2014 the day of the bombing.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very suspicious to me. That can\u2019t be a coincidence,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWhy did he wait until the day the office was reopened? Why didn\u2019t he bomb it over the Christmas vacation?\u201d\n\nAllen, who worked 14 years as an El Paso County sheriff\u2019s deputy, mostly as a patrol officer, said suspects often play down their motives for committing a crime because it affects the length of their sentence.\n\nMurphy, who is being held without bond, faces up to 20 years in prison for a federal charge of igniting an incendiary or explosive device that damages or destroys a building and 10 years for a charge of being a convicted felony in possession of a weapon.\n\n\u201cMurphy was interviewed by federal law enforcement, where he stated that the target of his criminal actions was not the NAACP, but that he had a different motive. The investigation continues regarding the motive for the attack,\u201d said Jeffrey Dorschner, spokesman for U.S. Attorney John Walsh.\n\nAllen said on the day of the explosion, two NAACP volunteers and the building owner, Gene Southerland, were the only people working in the building at 603 S. El Paso St. It contains only two operating businesses, the NAACP and Southerland\u2019s hair salon, called Mr. G\u2019s Hair Design Studio.\n\nNo one was hurt in the Jan. 6 bombing, which knocked items off of office walls and charred the side of the building.\n\nSurveillance video after the bombing helped identify Murphy\u2019s F-250 pickup and led federal agents to Murphy, then on parole for a 2009 theft conviction out of El Paso County.\n\nAgents interviewed Murphy on Feb. 19. Murphy confessed that he made a pipe bomb in his garage from Internet instructions.\n\nMurphy said he needed tax records from \u201c2006 to the present\u201d from DeHaven, who \u201coperated a business out of the building located at 603 S. El Paso.\u201d DeHaven wasn\u2019t returning his calls, and Murphy told agents he believed he had destroyed his tax returns. He needed the returns to file for bankruptcy. He just \u201cflipped out\u201d and built the pipe bomb as a warning to DeHaven, he said.\n\n\u201cMurphy admitted the rationale for the pipe bomb was rage,\u201d an arrest affidavit says.\n\nThe one piece of evidence suggesting that a tax preparation business operated out of the targeted building is a sign attached to the building saying \u201cIncome Tax.\u201d\n\nBut Allen, who has been attending meetings or working in the building since 1998, said a tax business has not operated at the building for at least the past 17 years.\n\nAttorney Elvin Gentry also found Murphy\u2019s story to be laced with inconsistencies.\n\nGentry represented DeHaven in a 2010 federal tax fraud case in which DeHaven overstated tax deductions including charities for 84 clients between 2003 and 2006 by nearly $142,000.\n\nDeHaven was sentenced to three years in federal prison on Sept. 10, 2010. Following his release in 2013, he lived in Arizona, and he died at the age of 62 on June 23.\n\nGentry and court documents indicate that DeHaven operated his business out of his home, nearly 5 miles away from the NAACP office.\n\nAllen said he wouldn\u2019t want to jump to conclusions that the NAACP was Murphy\u2019s real target, but he added that it makes more sense than Murphy going after DeHaven.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why we all jumped on the bandwagon that he was going after his accountant,\u201d he said.\n\nKirk Mitchell: 303-954-1206, denverpost.com/coldcases or twitter.com/kirkmitchell", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "NAACP president questions motive of bomber in Colorado Springs", "title": "NAACP president questions motive of bomber in Colorado Springs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/03/02/naacp-president-questions-motive-of-bomber-in-colorado-springs/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150109__colorado-springs-naacp-explosionp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150109__colorado-springs-naacp-explosionp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-03-02T16:52:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-25T20:51:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Even the timing of the Jan. 6 bombing seems to point to the NAACP office as being the target, Allen said.\nGentry and court documents indicate that DeHaven operated his business out of his home, nearly 5 miles away from the NAACP office.\nOne of the tenants, the Colorado Springs chapter of the NAACP, believes it\u2019s far more likely that suspect Thaddeus Cheyenne Murphy was targeting his group instead.\nGentry represented DeHaven in a 2010 federal tax fraud case in which DeHaven overstated tax deductions including charities for 84 clients between 2003 and 2006 by nearly $142,000.\nHenry Allen Jr., president of the Colorado Springs branch of the NAACP, said Murphy\u2019s professed motive is pocked with holes and appears to be a way to decrease a possible stiffer penalty."}
