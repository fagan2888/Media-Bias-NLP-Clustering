With the help of her sister, Lisa cared for her mother with Alzheimer\u2019s disease \u2014 managing medications, cleaning the house, and handling any medical issues. They also managed her mother\u2019s finances. Lisa shared:\n\n\u201cIt felt like our whole world was slowly falling apart. At the time we did not know much about the disease or how quickly it was going to debilitate her. My sister and I took responsibility of making sure that she was provided for\u2026\u201d\n\nTo help manage her mother\u2019s finances, Lisa became an agent under power of attorney. A power of attorney (POA) is a legal document used by an individual (the principal) to name someone else (the agent) to make financial decisions and act on the principal\u2019s behalf. It\u2019s a legal tool for family caregivers to allow them to make financial decisions for a parent, spouse or other loved one, and sometimes the responsibility extends to when that individual is no longer able to do so for him or herself.\n\nWithout a doubt, navigating and managing someone else\u2019s finances can be complicated, stressful and exhausting. Because power of attorney laws vary from state to state, these challenges can be even harder for those caring across state lines. And the differences in state laws as well as lack of oversight can lead to terrible consequences \u2014 even abuse.\n\nThat\u2019s why AARP is fighting for the Uniform Power of Attorney Act (UPOAA), a law that contains 21 provisions, including:\n\nOutlining the agent\u2019s duties and responsibilities so family caregivers have tools they need to make important financial decisions\n\nAddressing third-party concerns, like banks, about the legitimacy of a power of attorney\n\nProtecting individuals from exploitation\n\n\n\nSo far, UPOAA has been enacted in 18 states and counting.\n\nIn Washington and Utah, UPOAA has been passed by the state legislature and is awaiting the governor\u2019s signature.\n\nIn South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi and South Dakota, UPOAA has been introduced.\n\n\n\nHas your state passed the Uniform Power of Attorney Act yet?\n\nAre you managing a loved one\u2019s finances? Share your story.\n\nIf you\u2019re a family caregiver, you\u2019re not alone.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Let me introduce you to a fellow family caregiver, Lisa.
