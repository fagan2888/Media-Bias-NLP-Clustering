The rate of full-time members of this staff is down from Medscape's 2013 survey (84%). (The earlier report did not show part-time staff members.) The current survey includes coders as a category, which was not present in 2013; 21% of physician practices reported hiring full- or part-time dedicated coders, and 42% employed staff who handled both billing and coding. Forty-two percent employ billers only. The percentage of practices employing a full-time medical records clerk remained steady at 25% between 2013 and 2015.\n\nAmong all clinical positions, practices are most likely to hire medical assistants (85%).
