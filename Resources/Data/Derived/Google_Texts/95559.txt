As repair crews work to restore service following the deadly Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia, investigators continue sorting through conflicting information about an object striking the train's windshield before it went off the rails, killing eight.

National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt told CBS's "Face the Nation" program on Sunday that he wanted to "downplay" the idea that someone may have fired at the train.

He says the fracture pattern indicates a grapefruit-sized object that didn't completely penetrate the windshield.

An assistant conductor reported hearing the Amtrak engineer talking with a regional train engineer about both trains being struck by objects. But Sumwalt says the regional train engineer recalls no such conversation, and there's no record of the Amtrak engineer telling the dispatch center that something had struck the train.
