The stories were reported by Ray Leszcynski, Naomi Martin, Meredith Shamburger, Joe Simnacher, Valerie Wigglesworth and Hannah Wise with contribution from Tasha Tsiaperas.\n\nThe sky fell first in the south, mangling neighborhoods in Ellis County and Glenn Heights, then lifting again to drift harmlessly past the bulk of Dallas.\n\nSirens downtown howled after the storm, but it would save its worst for the north.\n\nThe air over Lake Ray Hubbard was still when Gary Tucker and his girlfriend walked out of the Bass Pro Shops in Garland on Saturday evening.\n\nLooking back, as a survivor of the deadliest touchdown of the night, he realizes the quiet was a warning.\n\n\u201cIt was dead calm,\u201d said Tucker, 52. \u201cWe could even hear in the real far distance, what sounded like a train. But it was was real far.\u201d\n\nThe radio warned the couple to take cover as they drove away from the lake, toward Tucker\u2019s home in Wylie. But they figured the danger zone was too broad to worry about.\n\nTucker was about to turn off the Interstate 30 service road onto the George Bush Turnpike when the tornado proved him wrong.\n\nHe heard a succession of booms. He saw a riding lawnmower fly by. Lumber and debris shot past at what seemed like 100 mph.\n\nTucker pulled the pickup over and the couple got down as low their seat belts would let them.\n\nAnd then they were flying too.\n\n\u201cThe truck lifted just literally straight up off the ground,\u201d Tucker said. \u201cIt came straight off the ground and we both blacked out.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen they came to, the truck seemed to have tumbled about 20 feet. Tucker heard a voice outside: \u201cAre you guys OK? Are you guys OK?\u201d\n\nThey crawled out the rear window. His girlfriend would need stitches, and she was lucky.\n\nAt the same interesection, bodies lay in vehicles that night.\n\nThe storm killed eight and hit an estimated 600 buildings before it left the Garland area. Sometimes it would spare one home to level another across the street.\n\nJanie Villalon, 36, had stir fry on the stove when she noticed the TV spaz out. Her husband opened the door. \u201cI think that\u2019s a\u2014\u201d he said.\n\nVillalon cut him off. She knew what it was; a tornado had hit her house in Pampa in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cTake cover,\u201d she yelled, and the couple ran and clinged to cupboards in the bathroom. The building shook and windows shattered as the twister passed, taking the roof off their apartment.\n\nNot far away, a bright blue flash interrupted movie night at the Kongs\u2019 house\u2014possibly a transformer exploding outside.\n\n\u201cWhoa, is that for real?\u201d thought Andy Kong.\n\nHis wife saw debris flying up into the sky, slammed the door and grabbed her baby.\n\nThe family turned a sofa over and climbed underneath it while tree branches rained in the living room. By the time the storm left Garland, cars had flown and the Kongs\u2019 deaf chihuahua was gone.\n\n***\n\nThe tornado rippled northeast over Lake Ray Hubbard as Rachel Portillo, her husband, their 16-year-old son, a golden retriever and a schnauzer all took shelter in their house on a peninsula.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how many people fit in the bathtub when you\u2019re scared,\u201d Portillo said.\n\nTen minutes later, the storm had cleared the lake and was tearing through southeastern Rowlett.\n\nNatalya Cherry and her husband were out of town with her in-laws that night, absorbed in a football game, oblivious to the alerts blowing up their cellphones.\n\nWhen the game ended, Cherry took a call: Come home. It\u2019s bad.\n\nThe couple left their 8-year-old with the in-laws and drove nearly 200 miles back to Rowlett, arriving to find their roof blown off and their son\u2019s room gone.\n\nAnd the storm had not stopped there.\n\n\u201cIt was the scariest thing we\u2019ve ever lived through,\u201d Melissa Skains said.\n\nThe tornado had pushed her and her two daughters along one wall as it ransacked their home in Farmersville. Her husband pushed them into a bathroom.\n\nAnd then the wind let them go.\n\n\u201cAfter it was all done, we all jumped up,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were so happy \u2026 Then we realized there were no walls.\u201d\n\nThe tornado continued to slash across Collin County, killing a baby in Blue Ridge before it evaporated back into the night.\n\nAll told, Saturday\u2019s storm cut a 70-mile trail from Faith Lane in Waxahachie, across two lakes and past Copeville, leaving behind countless stories of luck and loss, close calls and catastrophe.\n\nThe next morning, worshippers gathered at Harvest Praise Ministry in Glenn Heights. They gathered under an awning, which was the only thing left of their small church.\n\nAs it began its march north, the storm had come as a high-pitched whistle that tore out the church\u2019s roof and walls. But it did not touch the awning, nor the cross affixed to it, nor the pastor\u2019s wife who had sheltered beneath it.\n\nFor Sunday\u2019s service, pastor Kevin Taylor stood in the bed of a truck hemmed in by debris and addressed his congregation: \u201cWe built this with our hands, and we will do it again.\u201d\n\nCold rain poured down, and the youngest of the members sheltered the oldest from the wind.\n\nComplete coverage of the storm\u2019s devastation\n\n\u2018Total devastation\u2019: Residents, emergency crews work frantically after tornadoes\n\nTornado in Rowlett classified as EF3; 11 confirmed dead in storms in Garland, Collin County\n\nOfficials identify six of eight tornado victims who died in Garland\n\nStorm damages over 100 buildings in Glenn Heights\n\nFloyd: Weather\u2019s tragic capriciousness is still beyond our control\n\nNBC5: Staff shortage left NWS scrambling to cover tornado outbreak\n\nColliding weather systems caused tornado outbreak\n\nGov.
