COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) — Former President George H.W. Bush loves to fish and his well-known appreciation for angling landed him a giant replica of a lure.

The 91-year-old Bush was honored Thursday night as part of efforts to get more children — especially Hispanics — interested in fishing. Bass Pro Shops founder Johnny Morris presented the long lure to the nation's 41st president.

The George H.W. Bush Vamos A Pescar (VAH'-mohs ah pes-KAR') Education Fund gave a $50,000 check to groups trying to get more Hispanic children to go fishing. The fund was launched with a $125,000 donation from Morris.

The Eagle newspaper (http://bit.ly/1T97GuM ) reports that Morris also helped some children try their luck in a specially stocked pond behind the Bush library on the Texas A&M campus.

Bush also caught a catfish.
