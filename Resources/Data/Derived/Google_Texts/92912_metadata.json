As we know from research that\u0092s been done large projects tend to be more difficult to deliver. Rather than get ourselves into a situation where we can\u0092t deliver we\u0092re going to break it down into smaller pieces, phase it in.\u0094\n\nThe state was in contract negotiations with Wipro for work on Integrated Eligibility \u0097 a system for tracking Vermonters\u0092 eligibility across a wide spectrum of social services and programs, including Medicaid.\n\nThe state had yet to select a vendor for MMIS Core work, which will serve as the platform that supports other MMIS functions.\n\n\u0093These are contracts that could have been on the order of $100 million or more. The revised approach, we\u0092ll likely be able to reduce the cost,\u0094 said Lawrence Miller, chief of health care reform for Gov. Shumlin.\n\nThe state will still complete the projects, Johnson said.\n\n\u0093We\u0092re still absolutely committed to replacing the ACCESS system that we have that\u0092s 35 years old, but we\u0092re going to approach it in a different way,\u0094 he said. \u0093We\u0092re not going to reinvent the wheel and there\u0092s a lot more wheels available to us.\u0094\n\nThe projects were behind schedule. The administration had hoped to begin contracted work on Integrated Eligibility in October 2014, and for MMIS in February 2015.\n\nBut technological challenges with Vermont Health Connect, the state\u0092s online health insurance marketplace created under the federal Affordable Care Act, slowed progress. The systems were intended to all communicate and work together.\n\n\u0093It is primarily the opportunity to take advantage of existing systems,\u0094 Miller said, \u0093but it\u0092s also true that these were delayed because of Vermont Health Connect. The work that was done at Vermont Health Connect was supposed to be the foundation of those to go forward. The fact that Integrated Eligibility wasn\u0092t ready to start meant that these developments out in the world had time to happen.\u0094\n\nThe delay is not all bad, he said. The solutions created in other states can be used in Vermont, meaning less software development will be required, he said.\n\n\u0093When CMS funds work they maintain a license to it and it\u0092s transferable from state to state,\u0094 Miller said. \u0093It\u0092s an opportunity to reduce risk and cost and ultimately accelerate parts of the project as well.\u0094\n\nAHS officials plan to hold a series of meetings to determine the path forward.\n\n\u0093Over the next several weeks, the IE and MMIS Project Teams will be engaged in discussions regarding aligning our procurement approach and resource allocation with business and funding priorities,\u0094 Cohen wrote in his email.\n\nMiller said key lawmakers and the Joint Fiscal Office have been briefed on the administration\u0092s plans.\n\nneal.goswami @rutlandherald.com", "article_metadata": {"Keywords": "rutland herald, rutland, montpelier, vermont, politics, news, daily news, sports, obituaries, editorial, events, community, calendar, headlines, classifieds, real estate", "google-site-verification": "owx42JO8vuWkAqHrRECpIvAKOvyL0ayHOzHQkbWgm5w", "y_key": "a158acb4f2ab39b3", "Description": "Rutland Herald Online  -  Vermont election news, news coverage, local news, state government, sports, classifieds", "Subject": "Vermont Election News & Information"}, "article_summary": "But technological challenges with Vermont Health Connect, the state\u0092s online health insurance marketplace created under the federal Affordable Care Act, slowed progress.\nThe work that was done at Vermont Health Connect was supposed to be the foundation of those to go forward.\nThe administration had hoped to begin contracted work on Integrated Eligibility in October 2014, and for MMIS in February 2015.\n\u0093It is primarily the opportunity to take advantage of existing systems,\u0094 Miller said, \u0093but it\u0092s also true that these were delayed because of Vermont Health Connect.\nThe fact that Integrated Eligibility wasn\u0092t ready to start meant that these developments out in the world had time to happen.\u0094The delay is not all bad, he said."}
