Jim Duncan and Johnny Ellis introduced a bill to create the Alaska Health Insurance Corporation and in 2009, Sens. Hollis French and Ellis submitted a bill to establish universal health insurance in Alaska. Although admirable, neither proposal saw any movement in the Legislature. Given the political stalemate that has occurred in the Alaska Legislature in the past few years, any progressive changes have occurred because of the initiative process. Good examples are the minimum wage and marijuana initiatives. Thus, if Alaskans wish to reap the benefits of a single-payer health insurance program for all Alaskans, it will best come from the initiative process. Use Google to find an example of how ColoradoCare will be implemented when it passes as an initiative in November 2016. It is far less complicated than the Affordable Health Care Act.", "article_metadata": {"description": "OPINION: Alaskans should take a page from Colorado and put its own version of health care reform on the ballot, because that's the only way we'll have a rational health care system.", "og": {"url": "http://adn-pb.internal.arc2.nile.works/pb/commentary/article/alaska-would-be-better-its-own-single-payer-health-care-system/2015/12/30/", "site_name": "Alaska Dispatch News", "description": "OPINION: Alaskans should take a page from Colorado and put its own version of health care reform on the ballot, because that's the only way we'll have a rational health care system.", "title": "Alaska would be better off with its own single-payer health care system"}, "twitter": {"site": "@alaskadispatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "bb45485406c9d670397d6aa46b9c295a"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/akdispatch"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "article_summary": "Jim Duncan and Johnny Ellis introduced a bill to create the Alaska Health Insurance Corporation and in 2009, Sens.\nThus, if Alaskans wish to reap the benefits of a single-payer health insurance program for all Alaskans, it will best come from the initiative process.\nHollis French and Ellis submitted a bill to establish universal health insurance in Alaska.\nGiven the political stalemate that has occurred in the Alaska Legislature in the past few years, any progressive changes have occurred because of the initiative process.\nIt is far less complicated than the Affordable Health Care Act."}
