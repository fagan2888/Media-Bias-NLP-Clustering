Revenue jumped 61% from a year ago, as advertisers are drawn to the company\u2019s growing user base.\n\nShares jumped 2.6% to $73.10 in after-hours trading. If the gains hold through Thursday\u2019s opening bell, the stock will open at a new all-time high. Shares are up 173% over the past 12 months through Wednesday\u2019s close, the top performer in the S&P 500.\n\nIn conjunction with its quarterly results, Facebook also released a slew of charts highlighting its growth and its success in mobile advertising.\n\nFirst, here\u2019s a look at daily active users, who spend the most time on the social network\u2019s platform and are therefore more valuable to Facebook from an advertising perspective. These users increased to 829 million, up 19% from a year ago.\n\nMonthly active users hit 1.32 billion, up 14% from a year ago.\n\nMobile, once again, was the segment where Facebook saw big growth. Mobile daily active users rose to 654 million, up 39% from a year ago. Facebook\u2019s advertising has benefited from this growth. Mobile-advertising accounted for 62% of advertising revenue in the quarter, up from 59% in the first quarter and 41% a year ago.\n\nMobile monthly active users increased to 1.07 billion, up 31% from a year ago.\n\nBottom line: Facebook\u2019s revenue continues to grow to new heights. Revenue clocked in at $2.91 billion in the second quarter, up 61% from a year ago and ahead of analysts\u2019 expectations.\n\nUpdate: Facebook had 1.07 billion mobile monthly active users in the second quarter. An earlier version of this post incorrectly said 1.07 million.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Facebook Inc. is showing few signs of slowing down.
