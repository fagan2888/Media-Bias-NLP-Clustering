Students in 5th grade at Arminta Elementary use iPads to study Language Arts for the Smarter Balanced testing. North Hollywood, CA. April 3, 2014 (Photo by John McCoy / Los Angeles Daily News)\n\nMore than 30 sixth-graders sat at computers at Country Springs Elementary School in Chino Hills, but they weren\u2019t facing the monitors.\n\nInstead, they were watching a screen at the front of the room, where a video told them something rarely heard in schools today:\n\n\u201cYou are not being tested,\u201d the narrator explained. \u201cThe questions themselves are being tested.\u201d\n\nThis spring, in California and states across the nation, the usual barrage of standardized tests have been put on hold. California districts are getting at least a two-year reprieve from the ubiquitous Academic Performance Index scores used to track the quality of schools and districts over time.\n\nInstead, educators are preparing for the next big thing: The new Smarter Balanced English-language arts and mathematics tests aligned to the new Common Core standards that school districts have already begun using in classrooms. The new tests emphasize a deeper knowledge of subjects, displaying use of the reasoning process and the ability to give complex answers, and not just skill at choosing the correct answer out of four possible choices.\n\nThe nationwide field test started at the end of March and ends on June 6.\n\nThey need the ramp-up time: Unlike the familiar California Standards Tests, the new Smarter Balanced tests aren\u2019t conducted by filling in little circles with a No. 2 pencil. Instead, they\u2019re adaptive tests taken via computer, administered via the Internet.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019re going to be glitches with anything new, especially involving technology, but that\u2019s why we\u2019re having this no-stakes (testing) year,\u201d said Christopher Clarke, principal of Arminta Street Elementary in North Hollywood.\n\nTesting the test\n\nStudents taking the California Standards Tests are engaged in a nationwide \u201ctest of the test,\u201d applying the testing software in an attempt to head off the same sort of technological crises that plagued the Obamacare rollout over the last year.\n\n\u201cWe want to imagine every possible disaster that could happen and plan for it,\u201d said Carlye Olsen, director of accountability, staff development and educational technology for the Whittier Union High School District. \u201cWhy do you do fire drills? It\u2019s not just to know where to go; it\u2019s to make sure the bell works and the path is clear.\u201d\n\nThe new structure of the tests also requires school districts just starting to recover from years of economic hardship to invest in new technology, from network infrastructure to computers and tablets to peripherals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe have 35 iPads. One of them doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cI sat through the last 45 minutes of testing, and a lot of students had problems, and the iPads were falling offline. ... But as we get iPads in their hands and they get more comfortable with the technology, things will improve in future years.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles Unified officials have assured Clarke that the school\u2019s Internet connection will be better next year, when students are slated to take the actual test. \u201cThey\u2019re taking it very seriously,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWe\u2019re being assured by next school year that we\u2019ll have much faster connectivity.\u201d\n\nNo test scores are being generated by students this year; rather, it\u2019s a test to see how both the local and national network infrastructure can handle the load of students taking tests and whether the tests themselves work properly.\n\n\u201cWe still don\u2019t know what actually happens when everyone goes online all at once,\u201d said Pasadena Unified Superintendent Jon R. Gundry. He and his staff were at Pasadena High School, where more than 100 educators crowded into a cafeteria, hunched over Chromebooks, learning how to log on to the Smarter Balanced site and administer the new tests.\n\nAlthough school districts have worked to make sure all their students understand how to use a mouse and other aspects of a computer, younger kids who haven\u2019t written long essays on computers are unlikely to be as proficient as schools might want them to be.\n\nAnd some worry that students with exposure to computers at home will have an advantage over their peers.\n\n\u201cSome of what they\u2019re going to be testing through the next few years is how well the kids use technology,\u201d said Gundry. The Pasadena district currently only has one Chromebook \u2014 a low-cost, low-end Google laptop dependent on Internet connectivity \u2014 available for every four students. \u201cAnd that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d\n\nDistricts across Southern California are trying to minimize the impact of the technology gap.\n\nBut the investment should end up paying dividends year-round:\n\n\u201cOur kids had zero access to technology at school, but now, with the Common Core, and the testing on the computer, I\u2019ve got three computer labs at my school,\u201d said Wendy Claflin, principal of Colin Powell Elementary School in Long Beach. \u201cThis is bringing them to a whole other level of equity.\u201d\n\nQuestioning the questions\n\nBut beyond the technology issues are the test questions themselves: Educators have long mocked the multiple-choice thinking encouraged \u2014 some say demanded \u2014 by 13 years of the federal No Child Left Behind Act and its stiff penalties for districts that don\u2019t show continuing improvement on academic benchmarks. Even districts with high API scores have found themselves failing to continue to improve enough and thus eager to eke out every test score improvement they can.\n\nEducators like to share \u201cI Choose C,\u201d a video that portrays the alleged impact of more than a dozen years of students being taught test-taking strategies alongside (or instead of) an actual deep understanding of a subject. In it, a graduate in a job interview, when asked tough questions, repeatedly announces that she chooses answer \u201cC,\u201d because her teacher told her that, when in doubt, just guess that on tests.\n\nThe Common Core standards emphasize deeper understanding of fewer topics in a class and the ability to show how students arrived at answers. The Smarter Balanced tests even limit the ability of students to cheat off their peers. Questions are shuffled and students will not all see the exact same sets of questions on all tests.\n\nThe approach has been embraced by many parents:\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be great for the kids because it\u2019s going to teach them how to use reasoning,\u201d said Denise Jury, president of the Redlands Council of PTAs. In recent years, \u201cthey\u2019ve just been taught how to give the right answer, not how to get to the right answer.\u201d\n\nBut the shift is requiring a major adjustment for others:\n\n\u201cJust because my kid can\u2019t explain his thinking, but he\u2019s getting the math right, why isn\u2019t he getting the highest mark on his report card?\u2019\u201d said Tim Stowe, chief academic officer for Torrance Unified. \u201cThat\u2019s a big shift for parents.\u201d\n\nThe new approach is working for students, even measured by the older tests, Claflin said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not really emphasizing teaching to the benchmark any more, but (a second-grade teacher) said a higher percentage of her kids are above grade level ... because we have a more rigorous program now,\u201d Claflin said.\n\nSome are skeptical about the questions on the new test:\n\n\u201cI look at some of the samples and think \u2018Really? Some of the adults can\u2019t answer this,\u2019\u201d said Pasadena\u2019s Gundry. \u201cEvery time we show parents the sample questions, there\u2019s a roar in the room, because parents can\u2019t answer.\u201d\n\nBut whatever the initial reservations, over time there is the potential for overall benefit, Claflin noted.\n\n\u201cChange is always scary, but it can also be very exhilarating,\u201d Claflin said. \u201cThat outweighs the panic.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "More than 30 sixth-graders sat at computers at Country Springs Elementary School in Chino Hills, but they weren\u2019t facing the monitors.Instead, they were watching a screen at the front of the room, where a video told them something rarely", "title": "How Common Core education standards are changing the way LAUSD schools test children", "og": {"url": "http://www.dailynews.com/social-affairs/20140412/how-common-core-education-standards-are-changing-the-way-lausd-schools-test-children", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20140412/NEWS/140419758/AR/0/AR-140419758.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1098px"}, "type": "article", "title": "How Common Core education standards are changing the way LAUSD schools test children"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailynews.com", "description": "More than 30 sixth-graders sat at computers at Country Springs Elementary School in Chino Hills, but they weren\u2019t facing the monitors.Instead, they were watching a screen at the front of the room, where a video told them something rarely", "title": "How Common Core education standards are changing the way LAUSD schools test children", "url": "http://www.dailynews.com/social-affairs/20140412/how-common-core-education-standards-are-changing-the-way-lausd-schools-test-children", "image": {"src": "http://www.dailynews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LA/20140412/NEWS/140419758/AR/0/AR-140419758.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@ladailynews", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551745144", "iphone": "id502957174", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.ladailynews"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "common core,common core state standards, Student testing", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "common core,common core state standards, Student testing"}, "article_summary": "Instead, educators are preparing for the next big thing: The new Smarter Balanced English-language arts and mathematics tests aligned to the new Common Core standards that school districts have already begun using in classrooms.\nThey need the ramp-up time: Unlike the familiar California Standards Tests, the new Smarter Balanced tests aren\u2019t conducted by filling in little circles with a No.\nThe Common Core standards emphasize deeper understanding of fewer topics in a class and the ability to show how students arrived at answers.\nStudents in 5th grade at Arminta Elementary use iPads to study Language Arts for the Smarter Balanced testing.\nQuestions are shuffled and students will not all see the exact same sets of questions on all tests."}
