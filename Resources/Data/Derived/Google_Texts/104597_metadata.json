But despite spending all that money, most agencies aren\u2019t keeping track of who actually uses the phones, and they\u2019re paying wildly different rates for service.\n\nRelated: Federal Gov Pays Workers $5 Million to Not Work\n\nThat\u2019s according to a new Government Accountability Office report that says most of the 15 agencies it reviewed did not have an inventory of more than 1.5 million government-issued cell phones handed out to federal workers.\n\nInstead of having agency-wide inventory policies, the auditors said, the departments delegated responsibilities to separate offices\u2014making it even more difficult to track who (if anyone) ended up with the phones.\n\nIn one example, the GAO cited a 2011 report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration that found that the Internal Revenue Service wasted about $1.1 million on mobile devices and services because of lax device monitoring.\n\nRelated: Employee Misconduct Runs Rampant at the EPA\n\nThe IG said the IRS couldn\u2019t tell whether phones were actually being used. Over that time period, the agency paid about $48,000 in monthly fees for at least 113 unused devices.\n\nAuditors also said the government could save money if agencies streamlined service provider contracts. Right now, different agencies are paying different rates.\n\nThe report said agencies paid a range of rates per line for various service combinations, from $21 for 200 voice minutes, unlimited data and 200 text messages to $122 for unlimited voice, data and text messages. The auditors also said that depending on the package, agencies\u2019 costs varied from $69 to $122 per month depending on data and text plans.\n\nIn one example, three separate agencies in Atlanta paid three different monthly service rates for unlimited data on the same type of device\u2014$39, $94, and $120.\n\nThe GAO report comes several years after the Office of Management and Budget issued a memo to agencies requiring them to take steps to eliminate wasteful services, including unused mobile devices.\n\nSince then, it appears that agencies still lack a strategy to determine whether their phones are actually being used effectively. The GAO recommended each agency devise its own policy. The agencies concurred with the auditors\u2019 recommendations\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Every year, the federal government pays about $1.2 billion to provide federal workers", "title": "The U.S.\u2019s $1.2 Billion Out-of-Control Cell Phone Bill", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/22/US-s-12-Billion-Out-Control-Cell-Phone-Bill", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09012012_iPhone_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/05/22/US-s-12-Billion-Out-Control-Cell-Phone-Bill", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/09012012_iPhone_article.jpg", "creator": "@Briannaehley", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Every year, the federal government pays about $1.2 billion to provide federal workers", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Every year, the federal government pays about $1.2 billion to provide federal workers with cell phones and service.\nRight now, different agencies are paying different rates.\nBut despite spending all that money, most agencies aren\u2019t keeping track of who actually uses the phones, and they\u2019re paying wildly different rates for service.\nIn one example, three separate agencies in Atlanta paid three different monthly service rates for unlimited data on the same type of device\u2014$39, $94, and $120.\nSince then, it appears that agencies still lack a strategy to determine whether their phones are actually being used effectively."}
