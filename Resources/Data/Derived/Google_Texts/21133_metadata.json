After a long and stressful wait, doctors told Dua her 8-month-old son was fine. She left frustrated and unsatisfied with the wasted time.\n\n\u201cI turned to my husband and said to him, \u2018There has to be a better way to see patients. There has to be a better way for parents to get to the doctor themselves,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nDua, who began a private nephrology practice after completing her residency at UCLA in 2003, launched a health care smartphone application in February that arranges at-home doctor visits for a flat rate of $99.\n\nThe application, called Heal, is available in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Orange County. It has about 100 board-certified adult physicians pediatricians offering their services and allows users to schedule in-home appointments with certified local doctors from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily for services such as sports physicals, maternity exams and diagnoses of common illnesses such as strep throat, according to Heal\u2019s website.\n\nSimilar in-home medical service apps have launched in other cities such as San Francisco, New York and Chicago in recent years.\n\nHeal, however, is the first to reach Los Angeles. Every doctor arrives on site with a medical assistant and equipment, including an electronic medical record machine that can request access to a patient\u2019s medical history with a patient\u2019s permission, Dua said.\n\nDua didn\u2019t always intend to become a doctor. Her parents, both physicians, urged her to pursue a career outside medicine so she could explore a path different from theirs. Dua applied for a position as a high school science and math teacher but refused the job, fearing she would regret turning down the opportunity to go to medical school.\n\nDua said she is now teaching patients in a different way, revitalizing old-fashioned physician and patient interactions during on-call doctor visits.\n\nDua said studying nephrology, the study of kidney disease, allowed her to integrate education into her medical career and build lasting relationships with patients who receive long-term care.\n\n\u201cSome (patients) have become a part of who I am,\u201d Dua said. \u201cWhen I took maternity leave, I still talked with those patients, and when I returned, I looked forward to seeing them.\u201d\n\nMunaf Shamji, who completed training at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center with her, said Dua always strives to improve patient care, standing out in a medical field in which many doctors become complacent in how they approach patient care.\n\nShamji told of one occasion in which Dua approached leaders of the medical executive committee where they worked. After only two meetings, she suggested changing management strategies that had been in place years before she began working there.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t accept mediocrity,\u201d said Shamji. \u201cIf she felt strongly about a particular issue she wouldn\u2019t back down, and I think that\u2019s the greatest trait she has.\u201d\n\nDua said transitioning into the world of business was difficult because she had to face new challenges such as managing human resources and business economics, skills she wasn\u2019t taught in medical school.\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite sayings is, \u2018Do what is right, even if it is hard,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nNick Desai, Dua\u2019s husband and CEO of Heal, graduated from UCLA with a master\u2019s in electrical engineering and handles the economic side of the venture.\n\n\u201cNo two days are alike (working at Heal),\u201d Desai said.\n\nDesai said factors such as the Affordable Care Act and changing insurance policies allow Heal to be relevant in the market by, for example, letting patients use their physicians for a flat fee, regardless of insurance.\n\nDesai credits much of his work at Heal to the logical problem-solving methods he learned during his time in UCLA\u2019s electrical engineering graduate program.\n\nHe said while his wife was the impetus for the idea to develop Heal, the work ethic he developed in the engineering program, which at some points required him to study subjects that had never been studied before, ultimately enabled him to develop their family\u2019s experience into a business.\n\nDua said she still teaches every day, whether it be with her patients or with colleagues.\n\nNowadays, doctors are being pressured to see more and more patients and could be spending less time discussing illness prevention or management, she said. Therefore, she believes Heal changes the landscape of health care by personalizing standard checkups and allowing doctors to focus on visit quality over quantity.\n\nHeal recently expanded services to include suture replacement and removal, joint injections and the capacity to draw labs. Within the next year, Dua said she also plans to expand services to 12 more metropolitan areas. Although she can\u2019t release specifics, Dua said the app has exceeded its goals for customer usage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very much in the blessed position of being able to have the ability to do a little bit of everything,\u201d she said. \u201cI am mother, I am a wife, I am a doctor, I am a startup entrepreneur. I found a way to meld all of my loves into one great job.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "http://dailybruin.com/images/2015/08/web.ns_.dua_.COURTESY.PicA_.jpg", "description": "It took eight hours for Renee Dua to see a doctor after she rushed her son to the emergency room last year.
