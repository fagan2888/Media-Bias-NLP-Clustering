Fox31 also scored the award for best documentary, for the \u201cDay of Infamy: A Return to Pearl Harbor\u201d report by Hubbard, Sean Towle and Joshua Maranhas.\n\nEntrevision\u2019s KCEC was honored with several awards including spot news reporting for \u201cIncendios,\u201d (Juan Carlos Gutierrez, Mario Galarza) and best sport reporting (Luis Canela).\n\nIn the public TV realm, Rocky Mountain PBS won best mini-documentary for KRMA\u2019s \u201cArts District,\u201d by Lisa D. Olken, Carrie Saldo, Daniel Mercure, and best public affairs special for \u201d Losing Ground: The Cliff Effect,\u201d by Cynthia Hessin, Laressa Watlington and the I-News Team.\n\nOn the radio side, KOA again won station of the year.
