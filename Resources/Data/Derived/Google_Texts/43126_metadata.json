Senate Armed Services Committee chair John McCain (R-AZ) has explicitly asked the Air Force to disclose the winning figure, but, like much of the B-21 program, the dollar amount remains under wraps.\n\nPrice estimates cobbled together by various agencies within the Defense Department concluded it would take more than $23 billion to develop the B-21 and another $56 billion to buy 100 aircraft, costing around $560 million apiece.\n\nThe bomber program is expected to cost more than $1 trillion over its lifetime. Northrop beat a team from Lockheed Martin and Boeing to develop and build the plane.\n\nRelated: The Air Force\u2019s New Bomber Gets a Name: Meet the B-21\n\nLawmakers \u201cmay wish to revisit DOD\u2019s cost estimation to understand why the estimated cost was significantly higher than the actual bid,\u201d reads the report.\n\n\u201cIn addition, Congress may wish to use its oversight mechanisms to verify that the contract can be executed at the price bid,\u201d since in the past \u201csome contractors have been accused of bidding unrealistically low prices to win a given contract, then using their incumbency to appeal for higher appropriations,\u201d according to the report.\n\nThe analysis will likely serve as ammunition for skeptical lawmakers, like McCain, who aren\u2019t convinced the Air Force can successfully execute such a high-profile effort, given its past and ongoing debacles with its tanker replacement, the F-22 Raptor and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\n\nRelated: How the Air Force\u2019s New Planes Could Bankrupt the Pentagon\n\nCongress might also want to review its oversight set-up for the B-21 program before it effort gets fully underway.\n\nThe Air Force is managing development of the bomber through its Rapid Capabilities Office, an agency designed to fast-track high-priority, largely classified programs.\n\n\"Although this approach may improve the speed and ease of the acquisition, Congress has relatively little experience overseeing rapid acquisitions processes,\" the 18-page study states. \"Congress may wish to consider whether its ability to oversee such acquisitions is sufficient and if the advantages gained through rapid acquisition processes outweigh the challenges of oversight when applied to major defense acquisition programs.\"\n\nLawmakers might also \u201cwish to consider whether such Members\u2019 interests require a greater level of access to program data, or whether the issues can be adequately addressed under the current rules.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Congress might want to take a closer look at how the U.S. Air Force picked the winning bid for its next-generation bomber, according to a recent, independent assessment.", "title": "Do the Numbers Add Up for the New B-21 Bomber?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/18/Do-Numbers-Add-New-B-21-Bomber", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02262016_B_21.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/18/Do-Numbers-Add-New-B-21-Bomber", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02262016_B_21.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Congress might want to take a closer look at how the U.S. Air Force picked the winning bid for its next-generation bomber, according to a recent, independent assessment.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1c2f\"", "article_summary": "The bomber program is expected to cost more than $1 trillion over its lifetime.\nThe Air Force is managing development of the bomber through its Rapid Capabilities Office, an agency designed to fast-track high-priority, largely classified programs.\nSenate Armed Services Committee chair John McCain (R-AZ) has explicitly asked the Air Force to disclose the winning figure, but, like much of the B-21 program, the dollar amount remains under wraps.\nCongress should consider taking a closer look at how the U.S. Air Force picked the winning bid for its next-generation bomber, according to a recent independent assessment.\nRelated: How the Air Force\u2019s New Planes Could Bankrupt the PentagonCongress might also want to review its oversight set-up for the B-21 program before it effort gets fully underway."}
