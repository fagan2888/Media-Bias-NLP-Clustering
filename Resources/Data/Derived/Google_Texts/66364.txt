The Kansas Supreme Court. Kansas Judicial Branch

The Kansas Senate just passed a bill that would give the state’s judicial branch $2 million in additional funding for the year. But the legislation contains some interesting fine print.

Bill Raftery, who blogs at Gavel to Gavel, notes that embedded in the bill are several policy changes that would give local courts more control over drafting their budgets and picking chief judges for their districts, shifting power away from the state’s supreme court. The bill would also allow judicial vacancies to remain open for weeks longer than current law permits.

And not only that, the bill contains a non-severability clause that would invalidate the entire measure — including the funding — if “any provision of this act is stayed or is held to be invalid or unconstitutional.”

In other words, writes Mr. Raftery, “If the state supreme court were to strike down as unconstitutional ANY provision of supplemental funding bill HB 2338 (such as those removing the supreme court’s power over budgeting or appointing chief judges in the state) the funding would be eliminated.”

The legislation passed the Senate on Thursday by a vote of 23 to 12. The lower chamber has yet to take it up.
