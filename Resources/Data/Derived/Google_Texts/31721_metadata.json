That explains why John Wayne was the most popular American movie star for decades before his death in 1979 and for years afterward. And maybe even today. A 1995 poll asking \u201cWho is your favorite movie star?\u201d ranked him first, ahead of Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson, Denzel Washington and Kevin Costner. (He was the only dead movie star in the top 10.)\n\nThat\u2019s also why Wayne is the symbol of conservative \u2013 that is to say, white \u2013 America. As Garry Wills wrote about the big showdown scene in \u201cRed River,\u201d \u201cHere was Manifest Destiny on the hoof.\u201d\n\nWayne\u2019s legend, or, more precisely, his screen image, means nothing at all to me, strikes no chord of shared dreams. Bogart lived my unlived lives, and Bogie\u2019s world and the Duke\u2019s didn\u2019t even intersect. Which is why I can with all honesty say that Scott Eyman\u2019s \u201cJohn Wayne: The Life and Legend\u201d is one of the greatest movie star biographies ever written: If someone impervious to Wayne\u2019s persona can enjoy it so much, anyone at all interested in movies should.\n\nEyman, author of John Ford (\u201cPrint the Legend\u201d) and Ernst Lubitsch (\u201cLaughter in Paradise\u201d) bios, manages the rare critical feat of appreciating his subject\u2019s qualities while maintaining distance. \u201cJohn Wayne\u2019s story,\u201d he writes, \u201cis about many things \u2013 it\u2019s about the construction of an image, the forging of a monumental career that itself became a kind of monument. It\u2019s about a terribly shy, tentative boy reinventing himself as a man with a command personality, of a man who loved family but who couldn\u2019t sustain a marriage, and of a great friendship [with John Ford] that resulted in great films.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s also about twentieth-century conservatism, considered dangerously extreme at the time that became mainstream in the twenty-first century. \u201cIt is, in short, a life that can only belong to one man.\u201d\n\nEyman is certainly right about that. Gable never had the good fortune to latch onto two directors as great as John Ford and Howard Hawks. Gary Cooper\u2019s image has been eclipsed by Wayne\u2019s. James Stewart, in his heyday as big a star as Wayne until the mid-1960s and a far more versatile actor as well as a real life war hero, never allied himself with Manifest Destiny.\n\nClint Eastwood, once regarded as the late-20th-century version of Wayne, has dropped out of the running. \u201cDoes anyone expect Clint Eastwood to be America\u2019s favorite star a decade-and-a-half after his death?\u201d Garry Wills asked rhetorically in 1997. I don\u2019t think Eastwood is as popular as Wayne is right now.\n\n* * *\n\nMarion Robert Morrison \u2014 not Marion Michael or Marion Mitchell \u2014 was born May 26, 1907, to Scottish-Irish parents in Winterset, Iowa \u2014 a town of less than 3,000 souls, only two of them black. He never went back, though the Winterset Chamber of Commerce restored the house with period furniture. His parents never got along; his father was amiable but ineffectual, and his mother was regarded by many who knew her as a scold. (They separated in 1921.) By 1914 the family was living in the small town of Palmdale, Calif., on the edge of the Mojave Desert.\n\nYoung Marion enjoyed an idyllic adolescence: president of his senior class and the Latin Society, and even on the staff of the school newspaper. He graduated with a 94 average. He haunted the town library to read boys\u2019 magazines and the adventure novels of Sir Walter Scott, James Fenimore Cooper and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.\n\nThere were only two drawbacks: When the Morrisons first moved to Palmdale, his father raised corn, giving Marion the job of patrolling their land with a small caliber rifle to shoot rattlesnakes. He later recalled, \u201cI kept my fears to myself.\u201d Then there was his name. The Morrisons had an Airedale named Duke, and every time boy and dog passed the firehouse, men would call out to big and \u201cLittle Duke.\u201d Marion grabbed the nickname, sans the \u201clittle.\u201d\n\nDuke played high school football and pursued nothing in life, not even girls, with any particular enthusiasm. He drifted into the movie business with a summer job on a Tom Mix movie lot. Soon he met a silent film director named John Feeney, aka John Ford, who needed a prop man. The rest is history, though history took its own sweet time getting started.\n\nSometime around 1930 a studio head decided that the name Marion \u201cDuke\u201d didn\u2019t have much heat \u2014 \u201cJohn Wayne\u201d would look better on a marquee. (This made me think of that scene in \u201cShanghai Noon\u201d when Jackie Chan tells Owen Wilson that his name is \u201cChon Wang.\u201d \u201cJohn Wayne?\u201d says Wilson. \u2018That\u2019s a terrible cowboy name.\u201d)\n\nRichard Widmark famously said, \u201cJohn Ford invented John Wayne,\u201d but it was Raoul Walsh who gave Wayne his first big role in the 1930 Technicolor epic \u201cThe Big Trail.\u201d (\u201cI don\u2019t want an actor,\u201d Walsh supposedly said, \u201cI want someone to act natural.\u201d) The picture bombed; most theaters couldn\u2019t accommodate the widescreen format. It was the last A-list picture Wayne made for 10 years.\n\nFord, surely one of the most perverse figures in Hollywood history \u2013 James Cagney thought that one word described him, \u201cmalice\u201d \u2014 cut Wayne dead until 1939. Even when Wayne became the biggest star in movies Harry Carey Jr. thought, \u201cHe was always frightened of Ford \u2026 Duke didn\u2019t have to be that scared of him, but he was.\u201d\n\nEyman does a splendid job of leading us through Hollywood\u2019s transition from silents to talkies, from black-and-white to color, from B-movies to A-listers. An account of Wayne\u2019s penance in low-budget movies is great reading. Of an early hockey film he writes, \u201cIf you always wanted to see John Wayne on skates, \u2018Idol of the Crowds\u2019 (1937) is the movie for you.\u201d In \u201cOverland Stage Raiders\u201d (1938) Wayne had the great Louise Brooks for a leading lady. (It was her last film.) Eyman is also good on late career clunkers like \u201cThe Conqueror\u201d (1956), in which Wayne was cast as Genghis Khan: \u201cOne of those unusual pictures that really are as bad as their reputation would indicate \u2026 the world\u2019s biggest Ed Wood movie.\u201d\n\nFinally, in 1939, Ford dropped his mysterious grudge and gave Wayne the role that would change his fortune, the Ringo Kid in \u201cStagecoach.\u201d Eyman calls it, correctly I think, \u201cmore than a piece of movie history; it becomes American history.\u201d Even Pauline Kael, who was less susceptible to Wayne\u2019s image than I was, wrote of \u201cStagecoach\u201d that \u201c [it] had a mixture of reverie and reverence about the American past that made the picture seem almost folk art.\u201d\n\nBut, as Garry Wills points out in \u201cJohn Wayne\u2019s America\u201d (published in 1997, reprinted by Touchstone), Wayne did not become a superstar until the release of Howard Hawks\u2019 \u201cRed River\u201d in 1948. Upon seeing it, Ford is reputed to have said, \u201cI never knew the big son of a bitch could act.\u201d No other major star except Bogart, 42 in 1941 when \u201cThe Petrified Forest\u201d and \u201cThe Maltese Falcon\u201d were released, had to wait so long for stardom.\n\nEyman may cut Wayne down to size a bit, but his warts-and-all approach makes Wayne seem more human and approachable than in previous biographies. For instance, Hollywood\u2019s biggest Republican got a union card in 1929, No. 34854 of Local 37 of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and Moving Picture Machine Operators, and was proud of it all his life. And the man who will forever be associated with westerns didn\u2019t like horses: \u201cI don\u2019t get on a horse unless they pay me.\u201d\n\nOne of his favorite albums was Sinatra\u2019s \u201cThe September of My Years\u201d (mine, too). George Plimpton once listened to Wayne recite John Milton from memory. He read Winston Churchill\u2019s speeches, and in his library had copies of Tolkien\u2019s books and \u2013 this really floored me \u2013 Nabokov\u2019s \u201cLolita.\u201d (Maybe he knew that Nabokov\u2019s politics were similar to his own.)\n\nThere are great stories, such as the time Wayne ran into Michael Caine in the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel, pointed a finger at him and asked \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cMichael Caine.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right. I saw you in that movie \u2013 what was it called?\u201d \u201cAlfie.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Wayne put his arm around Caine, told him he was going to be a star and gave him some advice: \u201cTalk low, talk slow, and don\u2019t say too fucking much. Also never wear suede shoes.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cBecause one day I was taking a piss and the guy in the next stall recognized me and turned towards me and said, \u2018John Wayne \u2013 you\u2019re my favorite actor!\u2019 and pissed all over my suede shoes. So don\u2019t wear them when you\u2019re famous, kid.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An amazing new biography of John Wayne really charts the ways in which modern conservatives came to see themselves", "title": "The right\u2019s twisted symbol: John Wayne and conservatives\u2019 lost dignity", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "An amazing new biography of John Wayne really charts the ways in which modern conservatives came to see themselves", "title": "The right\u2019s twisted symbol: John Wayne and conservatives\u2019 lost dignity", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/13/the_rights_twisted_symbol_john_wayne_and_conservatives_lost_dignity/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/john_wayne.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "An amazing new biography of John Wayne really charts the ways in which modern conservatives came to see themselves", "title": "The right\u2019s twisted symbol: John Wayne and conservatives\u2019 lost dignity", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/john_wayne.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Allen Barra", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Books, Conservatives, John Wayne", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda35c\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Books, Conservatives, John Wayne, Entertainment News, Politics News\u201cProfessional American,\u201d wrote Greil Marcus in \u201cJohn Wayne Listening.\u201d \u201cHe wears the mantle of Manifest Destiny easily, happy to represent America to the world, to itself, and to himself.\u201dExactly.\nSoon he met a silent film director named John Feeney, aka John Ford, who needed a prop man.\nThat explains why John Wayne was the most popular American movie star for decades before his death in 1979 and for years afterward.\n(This made me think of that scene in \u201cShanghai Noon\u201d when Jackie Chan tells Owen Wilson that his name is \u201cChon Wang.\u201d \u201cJohn Wayne?\u201d says Wilson.\nGable never had the good fortune to latch onto two directors as great as John Ford and Howard Hawks."}
