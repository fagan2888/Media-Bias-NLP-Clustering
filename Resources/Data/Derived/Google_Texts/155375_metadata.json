Today, her family held a fish fry along 8th street to help raise money for funeral costs and other costs the family is dealing with in her absence. Osborne's father says the loss has been tough on their family.\n\nVictim's father William Morton says, \"I got three granddaughters and they'll never grow up to see their mother again. Maybe one day in heaven, but we're all going to pitch in and help raise these babies. It's going to be a long road, long haul, and one thing about it, she'll always be here in everybody's heart.\"\n\nHe says while this has been a hard time for everyone, they're thankful for all the support they've seen from the community. The Independent Riderz were also a sponsor in this fish fry.", "article_metadata": {"medium": "video", "description": "Many attended a benefit fundraiser to benefit the funeral costs of Jessica Osborne.", "language": "english", "author": "Aaron Morrison", "og": {"description": "Many attended a benefit fundraiser to benefit the funeral costs of Jessica Osborne.", "title": "Fish Fry Benefits Murder Victim's Funeral", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Fish-Fry-Raises-Money-for-Murder-Victims-Funeral-264129961.html", "image": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/3E0/89B/3E089B1F94F04CBC86E92C7AC8B7E423", "video": "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/0C7/548/0C75484E1AA540B5BC7295B66258C4DC.mp4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "www.wtok.com", "description": "Many attended a benefit fundraiser to benefit the funeral costs of Jessica Osborne.", "title": "Fish Fry Benefits Murder Victim's Funeral", "url": "http://www.wtok.com/home/headlines/Fish-Fry-Raises-Money-for-Murder-Victims-Funeral-264129961.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/fishy4.jpg", "creator": "@newscenter11", "site": "@newscenter11", "card": "summary"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "video_type": "video/mp4", "video_height": 288, "keywords": "Fish Fry Benefits Murder Victim's Funeral", "google-site-verification": "M1YwZ85zoJ2ZNboZjzjADGJ9L53qqzbNOi6FLrtDw9U", "video_width": 512, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Fish Fry Benefits Murder Victims"}, "article_summary": "Today, her family held a fish fry along 8th street to help raise money for funeral costs and other costs the family is dealing with in her absence.\nThe Independent Riderz were also a sponsor in this fish fry.\nMaybe one day in heaven, but we're all going to pitch in and help raise these babies.\nIt's going to be a long road, long haul, and one thing about it, she'll always be here in everybody's heart.\"\nOsborne's father says the loss has been tough on their family."}
