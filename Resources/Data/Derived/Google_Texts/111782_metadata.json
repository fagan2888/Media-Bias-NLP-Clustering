Duncan of Benchmark Financial Group Inc., \u201cThe consumer won't have any unbiased help from licensed independent professionals, representation when it comes to their claims, pharmacy and other issues \u2026 and be at the mercy of 800 numbers, and waiting in long telephone lines.\u201d\n\nBlue Cross has been paying agents a 2 percent commission on individual sales. Plan rates are the same, whether consumers use agents or not.\n\nBlue Cross spokeswoman Ashley Hudgeons said the decisions won't impact commissions for individual renewals, any sales or renewals within the group market or Medicare market, or retail ancillary products.\n\n\u201cAs always, we assess and evaluate our commission structure on an ongoing basis and will make adjustments as appropriate,\u201d Hudgeons said. \u201cWe are committed to expanding access to quality health care to as many Oklahomans as possible through the retail market, and we have been \u2018all-in' since the inception of ACA (Affordable Care Act).\u201d\n\nShe noted the availability of a variety of educational resources \u2014 in both English and Spanish \u2014 to help consumers navigate the entire health insurance process.\n\n\u201cHowever, as the individual market evolves, we, in turn, need to make changes to the way we operate in order to continue offering sustainable health plan options to our members,\u201d Hudgeons said.\n\nBlue Cross has 75 percent or more of the individual market in Oklahoma, and is one of only two insurers participating in the state's federally-\n\nrun healthcare.gov insurance exchange and individual market.\n\nThe other insurer, UnitedHealthcare, pays 2 percent commissions on policies sold off the exchange, Janway said, but eliminated commissions on exchange policies, starting this past enrollment period, she said.\n\nUnited Healthcare spokesman Dustin Clark said, \u201cOur actions are consistent with our long-stated approach to continually evaluate the dynamics of exchanges as they evolve, and to refocus our resources as necessary so that we can provide consumers with access to quality care.\u201d\n\nIncluding its group plans, UnitedHealthcare insures 405,000 Oklahomans, Clark said.\n\nInsurers once paid commissions up to 15 percent on sales of policies for individual plans. But the incentives have been dwindling for the past several years, with the current national trend in California and elsewhere being to eliminate them.\n\nJanway and other agents are concerned that Oklahoma's current policy premiums \u2014 which were approved and filed through the Oklahoma Insurance Department \u2014 include compensation to agents, as agents are part of carriers' medical-loss ratios. Ratios measure the share of health care premium dollars spent on medical benefits, and insurance carriers aren't allowed to deduct commissions/fees from their administrative expenses when calculating the ACA ratio, she said.\n\n\u201cSo does eliminating commissions without lowering premium add to a carrier's profit?\u201d she asks.\n\nWayne Pettigrew, president of the Oklahoma State Association of Health Underwriters, said his group plans to review the recent changes and study whether to request a regulatory ruling from the Oklahoma insurance commissioner.\n\nSome 145,329 Oklahomans signed up for health insurance through healthcare.gov this year, compared with 126,115 covered in 2015, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. Fifty-one percent of the Oklahomans who actively re-enrolled for this year switched to a new plan \u2014 which would disqualify any involved agents for commissions in the future, since they wouldn't technically be renewals.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Oklahoma began informing health insurance agents on Tuesday that the company will soon stop paying commissions on the sales of new policies for individual plans.
