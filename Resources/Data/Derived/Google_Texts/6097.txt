PHOENIX (AP) - The Federal Communication Commission is lowering the rates for in-state telephone calls for prisoners, leaving the Arizona Department of Corrections with a potentially large financial hit.

The FCC’s decision earlier this month to cap call rates will likely take money away from prison education programs, the Arizona Capitol Times reports (http://bit.ly/1P4GUUH).

Prison calls, which normally cost 24 cents per minute, will now cost 11 cents per minute. Calls typically generate about $4 million a year for the department.

Under state law that money goes toward schooling, law library supplies for prisoners and a building renewal fund.

Department spokesman Andrew Wilder says the ruling does not take effect for 90 days.

The FCC argues that exorbitant rates make it nearly impossible for prisoners to stay in touch with loved ones.

Donna Hamm runs prisoner advocacy group Middle Ground Prison Reform, and says prisoners’ families shouldn’t have to fund these programs.

“The actual revenue stream will be reduced and everyone is going to have to live with that - the phone companies and the departments of corrections - they’re just going to have to look elsewhere to have revenue streams,” Hamm said.

In 2013, the FCC decided to limit charges for out-of-state calls, calling the fees “unjust and unreasonable.”

The FCC has been considering the same for in-state calls for over a decade. Retired nurse Martha Wright’s grandson was incarcerated when she petitioned the commission in 2003. Now deceased, she said at the time that she wanted the FCC to do something about the exorbitant rates.
