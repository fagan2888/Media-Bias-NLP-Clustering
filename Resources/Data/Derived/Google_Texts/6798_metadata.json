Qualifying matches for the tournament begin this fall.\n\n\u201cI love the fact that qualifiers are right around the corner because it does bring laser focus,\u201d Ellis said during a conference call Friday. \u201cI know the expectation, I embrace the expectation, I know we want to win.\u201d\n\nSunil Gulati, president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, said Ellis\u2019 familiarity with the program made her the right choice.\n\n\u201cShe gets top marks in all the work she has been doing on the technical side,\u201d Gulati said.\n\nEllis now must hone the style of play for the top-ranked U.S. women, who have tried to become a more refined, possession-oriented team but usually end up relying on their athleticism and physical advantages to overwhelm the competition with fast-paced attacks.\n\nThat strategy has been more challenging of late, as the quality of the women\u2019s game has improved substantially in places like Japan and France. The team had a disappointing 7th place performance at the Algarve Cup earlier this year.\n\nEllis suggested that coaching this team was about building a balance\u2013recognizing the importance of holding the ball and building an offense from the back to the front. But, she added. \u201cI recognize we do have unique players,\u201d she said. \u201cThe counter is going to be a part of our weaponry.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "U.S. Soccer stayed in-house Friday hiring Jillian Ellis as the head coach of the women\u2019s national team.", "title": "Ellis Is Named Coach of U.S. Women\u2019s Soccer Team", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/dailyfix/2014/05/16/ellis-is-named-coach-of-u-s-womens-soccer-team/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CV314_soccer_P_20140516144456.jpg"}, "site": "WSJDailyFix", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Life", "article.headline": "Ellis Is Named Coach of U.S. Women\u2019s Soccer Team", "description": "U.S. Soccer stayed in-house Friday hiring Jillian Ellis as the head coach of the women\u2019s national team.", "article_section": "Life", "author": "Matthew Futterman", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "testkeys": "C", "article.page": "The Daily Fix Blog", "page.subsection": "The Daily Fix", "article.summary": "U.S. Soccer stayed in-house Friday hiring Jillian Ellis as the head coach of the women\u2019s national team.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.published": "2014-05-16T18:47:57-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-138", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/dailyfix/2014/05/16/ellis-is-named-coach-of-u-s-womens-soccer-team/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-DFB-21321", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Life", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "U.S. Soccer stayed in-house Friday hiring Jillian Ellis as the head coach of the women\u2019s national team.", "title": "Ellis Is Named Coach of U.S. Women\u2019s Soccer Team", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/dailyfix/2014/05/16/ellis-is-named-coach-of-u-s-womens-soccer-team/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CV314_soccer_P_20140516144456.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "The Daily Fix", "article.id": "BL-DFB-21321", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-05-16T18:48:15-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0125\"", "article_summary": "Jillian Ellis was named head coach of the U.S. women\u2019s soccer team Associated PressU.S. Soccer stayed in-house Friday hiring Jillian Ellis as the head coach of the women\u2019s national team.\nEllis suggested that coaching this team was about building a balance\u2013recognizing the importance of holding the ball and building an offense from the back to the front.\n\u201cI love the fact that qualifiers are right around the corner because it does bring laser focus,\u201d Ellis said during a conference call Friday.\n\u201cI know the expectation, I embrace the expectation, I know we want to win.\u201dSunil Gulati, president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, said Ellis\u2019 familiarity with the program made her the right choice.\nThat strategy has been more challenging of late, as the quality of the women\u2019s game has improved substantially in places like Japan and France."}
