Luckett of the Louisville architectural firm of D.X. Murphy and Associates \u2014 which designed Churchill Downs \u2014 and landscape architect Carl Berg. The two-bedroom apartments, in 66 brick veneer buildings, rented originally for $75 a month.\n\nLynn Acres was thought to have been built next to the Naval Ordnance Station to provide housing for workers there and to accommodate returning service members and people who stayed in Louisville after coming to work in other war-related industries, said Rachel Kennedy, with Corn Island Archaeology consultants in Jeffersontown.\n\nAt the time, homes were so scarce that multiple families were crowded into existing housing, and \u201cpeople were living in chicken coops,\u201d she said.\n\nLynn Acres helped relieve the housing shortage at a time when the Federal Housing Administration was providing mortgage insurance backing for such projects and when families \u201cneeded housing very, very quickly,\u201d said Joanne Weeter, an independent historic preservation consultant.\n\nIn 1941, the ordnance station began production of equipment and did maintenance work for the Navy under a contract with Westinghouse Electric Corp., which continued throughout World War II.\n\nAt its peak, the facility employed 4,200 people, a number that declined after the war but rose again during the Korean War, the Encyclopedia of Louisville says.\n\nORIGINAL DEVELOPERS\n\nLynn Acres was developed by Leroy Highbaugh Sr. and Leroy Highbaugh Jr., perhaps better known for their roles in the history of Hurstbourne. They owned the Lynnford estate house that became the Hurstbourne Country Club, and in 1965 the younger Highbaugh began developing the family\u2019s surrounding farm property into the community of Hurstbourne.\n\nWeeter notes that Lynn Acres was designed in the shape of a racetrack, and it also was near the old Douglas Park racetrack, once owned by Churchill Downs. The Lynn Acres land may have been sold off from the track property, she said.\n\nCHILDREN OR NOT?\n\nA 1951 Courier-Journal story said a new form of \u201csegregation\u201d \u2014 for families with or without children \u2014 was developing in Lynn Acres and also would be adopted in Arcadia, the 432-unit apartment complex on Arcade Street near Taylor Boulevard.\n\nAbout one third of Lynn Acres was reserved for families without children, because the two family types weren\u2019t thought to mix well, \u201cespecially when the children occupy a second floor apartment.\u201d\n\nA 1955 Courier-Journal story by real estate editor Grady Clay \u2014 picturing Lynn Acres \u2014 said that the number of large apartment projects approved by the FHA was dwindling, largely because of more favorable financing terms for single-family houses and a 1954 congressional tightening of regulations.\n\nFUTURE\n\nKennedy and Weeter are researching the history of Lynn Acres \u2014 which they say has changed very little over the years \u2014 for a report nominating the complex to the National Register of Historic Places and also for applications to receive federal and state historic rehabilitation tax credits.\n\nThe register application initially would be reviewed by the Kentucky Heritage Council/State Historic Preservation Office and ultimately would go to the National Park Service, if approved along the way.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the largest and most complex historic tax credit projects in the state,\u201d Weeter said. It\u2019s geared toward continued use as affordable housing, a national trend, she said.\n\nReporter Martha Elson can be reached at (502) 582-7061, melson@courier-journal.com and on Facebook.
