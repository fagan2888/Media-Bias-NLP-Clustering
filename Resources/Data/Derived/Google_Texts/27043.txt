House Speaker John A. Boehner says he isn’t going to ditch his Obamacare coverage for Medicare, even though the Ohio Republican became eligible for the government health program for seniors by turning 65 this week.

The Affordable Care Act requires members of Congress and their official staff to get their health coverage through the new health care exchanges set up under President Obama’s overhaul. Some opted to go through the D.C. small-business exchange, some went through HealthCare.gov in their home states and some avoided government-tinted coverage altogether and hopped on their spouses’ plans.

“I’ll continue to purchase my expensive health care coverage,” Mr. Boehner quipped at a news conference Tuesday, alluding to his plan under the health care law, which Republicans lambast as misguided and expensive for regular Americans.

Mr. Boehner’s office told Politico last year that the speaker selected a policy that costs $449 per month in premiums with a $1,000 deductible.
