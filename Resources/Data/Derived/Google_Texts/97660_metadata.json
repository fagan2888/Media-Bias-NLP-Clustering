The annual charade of blocking Clinton-era cuts to Medicare has officially ended. And now, lawmakers have actually asserted their clout on foreign policy for the first time in memory. Forcing the president to back down on his bid to circumvent Congress with his plan to lift sanctions on Iran may not sound like the biggest deal in the world. And there certainly is a large trap door built into the back of the plan that would give the president an ample opportunity to slip congressional oversight in the end. But for a president who started out with a plan to flout Congress using executive power and the UN to end up acceding to congressional review is something of a signal moment. It\u2019s more significant given the fact that Congress has so consistently, miserably failed to take any action on foreign policy despite years of bitter criticism and invective.\n\n\n\nThis matters for a couple of reasons. First, it could shape the way other initiatives are handled. Now that rebellious Democrats have found that the president will cave on key issues, they will keep pushing. The administration has backed off before, but succumbing to open defiance from the minority leader in waiting, Chuck Schumer, and others will invite further intra-party brigandage. And Obama, legacy-minded as always, may see newfound merit in achievement over ideological purity and ego protection. If congressional Republicans have sufficiently sorted out \u2013 or put on hiatus \u2013 their various blood feuds to avoid successive collapses over the next 18 months, Washington could stand in a very different light. And that could shape the political narrative for 2016. Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has a campaign message predicated on making Washington work again. So how would she fare if Washington was (kinda) working?\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no chance for sweetness, light and grand bargains, but if Washington has found its way to something that actually works, it would be a miracle. After a decade of intensifying dysfunction, even basic operation would be welcome to most voters. That would likely help the ratings of both parties. The less Washington makes America think about it, the better America likes Washington. And that could deprive Clinton of her self-designated role as the technocratic leader born to make government work again. That could also give the eventual Republican nominee a better chance to avoid the label as an extremist or hostage taker.\n\n\n\n[House Speaker John Boehner is out with a Tax Day video pitching a suite of legislation aimed at corralling the IRS.]\n\n100 DAY REPORT CARD\n\nThe day after Republicans took control of both the House and the Senate last fall, House Speaker John Boehner and then-elect Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell set a detailed agenda for what they wanted to accomplish. Today marks 100 days since the new Congress began, and it\u2019s time for a progress report on how they\u2019re doing.\n\n\n\nKeystone - Check this off the list. Although President Obama vetoed the Keystone Pipeline XL bill, it was the first piece of legislation Sen. McConnell brought to a vote in the new Congress.\n\n\n\nVeterans - The House passed the Hire More Heroes Act unanimously only hours after being sworn in, but it is still under review in the Senate. Over at the VA, major problems still abound.\n\n\n\nTax reform - Doubtful. Both sides have talked about a broad-based plan, and new House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan keeps pushing. But Hill watchers are skeptical that a grand bargain could come together, especially with funding and spending deadlines looming at the end of September. And after that, the vortex of 2016 elections will have Congress fully in its thrall.\n\n\n\nEducation - \u201cWe\u2019ll also consider legislation\u2026to support innovative charter schools around the country,\u201d Boehner and McConnell wrote back in November. While education choice has been a hot topic in several cities and states around the country the new Congress hasn\u2019t really touched on it.\n\n\n\nTerrorism - While Boehner and McConnell vowed to fight Terrorism, that\u2019s not really in their job descriptions. Aside from funding, there\u2019s not much for Congress to do. But the budget plans floating around Capitol Hill provides full funding for the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security.\n\n\n\nGovernment regulation - While there have been lots of hearings, Congress hasn\u2019t yet done much on this front.\n\n\n\nObamacare - No, not repealing it. Boehner and McConnell decided to try and reverse Obamacare\u2019s definition of full-time employment. Eighteen House Democrats joined Republicans to pass the Save the American Worker Act, which restores the definition of a full work-week as 40 hours verses Obamacare\u2019s 30 hours. It\u2019s awaiting Senate action and subject to a threatened presidential veto.\n\n\n\n[A special election date for former Illinois Rep. Aaron Shock\u2019s seat will be September 10, and primary election on July 7, reports the Chicago Tribune.]\n\n\n\nMORE QUESTIONS, STILL NO ANSWERS ON HILLARY EMAIL SCANDAL\n\nIn December 2012 congressional investigators asked Hillary Clinton directly if she used a private email account while serving as secretary of state. Her answer: Silence. The question, in a letter from House Oversight Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., and first reported by the New York Times, was posed seven weeks before Clinton\u2019s tenure ended. When the State Department eventually responded to Issa\u2019s demand in March 2013, nearly two months after she left office, officials also ignored the question about Clinton\u2019s digital hygiene. Given Clinton\u2019s admission that she used a personal account (and a private server) exclusively as secretary, news of this apparent dodge ads to a scandal that has cost the Democratic presidential candidate dearly in polls. As the drip of damaging details continues, when and in what venue Clinton will address the growing scandal is the question.\n\n\n\n[LAT reports that the entertainment industry has swung fully into line this time and will not buck Clinton\u2019s second bid.]\n\n\n\nPoll finds strong yearning among Dems for an alternative - USA Today: \u201cA 55% majority of Democrats say it's \u2018very important\u2019 to them to see strong challenges to Hillary Clinton for the presidential nomination.

She was cordial, if a bit formal, with the panelists. After the meeting, she directed a group photo and chatted a bit with a student headed to the Naval Academy, but didn\u2019t hug anyone.\u2026If you\u2019re expecting a Hillary Clinton who is letting her hair down and hangin\u2019 with regular folks in the heartland, better keep looking.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Watch Fox: Chief White House Correspondent Ed Henry reports on Hillary\u2019s events live from Norwalk, IA]\n\n\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE\u2026\n\nSometimes we just need to get back to the basics. Charles Dickens The Pickwick Papers were an unpopular series of installments of Dickens book Pickwick meant to entertain the newly forming middle class. Pickwick told the story of Mr. Pickwick and his friends searching through England for new information leading to the betterment of mankind. The story didn\u2019t catch with audiences until the character Sam Weller, a young shoe polisher with quick wit, was introduced to the tale. Working-class Weller immediately related with audiences and sales skyrocketed. Pickwick stayed on the bestseller list for thirty years.\n\n\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

Rand Paul, R-Ky. Asked about his views on exceptions to late term abortion, Paul told reporters to ask the Democratic leader \u201cif she is OK with killing a seven-pound baby that is not born yet.\u201d On \u201cThe Kelly File,\u201d Schultz defended her opposition to restrictions on late-term abortion:\n\n\n\n\u201cThe state has a right to step in on behalf of the fetus and say at some point that fetus does obtain rights,\u201d Kelly pressed. \u201cYou would admit that you can\u2019t have women aborting third trimester just on a whim?\u201d \u201cCertainly not on a whim,\u201d Schultz responded. \u201cThere is no ambivalence here. We are very clear. We believe that that decision is best left not to government, but between a woman and her doctor. So, I can\u2019t tell you a specific date and time past which we on all cases are certain that choice shouldn\u2019t be made. Because that decision is very unique and individual to the woman and should be in consultation with her conscience and her God and her doctor. That is a decision left to her.\u201d Watch the full interview here.\n\nTAX DAY: RUBIO LOOKS TO SELL HIS PLAN\n\nFresh from his campaign announcement, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is back in Washington and using Tax Day to hawk the tax plan he crafted with Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Rubio and Lee are speaking today at the conservative Heritage Foundation, but the two have faced substantial blowback from the right for not calling for a steeper reduction for the top bracket and not eliminating more deductions. Rubio is the only top-tier candidate with a specific tax-reform proposal, which means that he is the only one who can face specific attacks. If Rubio can draw his rivals into a tax debate, though, he might force them to back up promises and claims with actual proposals.\n\n\n\n[Rubio\u2019s campaign produced a lush-looking behind-the-scenes video of the Florida senator\u2019s announcement day, mixing lines from the speech with family photos and scenic shots from around the country.]\n\n\n\nWait.

For his part, Rubio has been equally kind to his prospective rival. \u2018Jeb is my friend. He is still my friend.

Scott Walker backed a new trade agreement being pursued by the United States and the European Union. The GOP governor and all-but-certain presidential candidate spoke about the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership while visiting the Hannover Messe trade show, part of a three-country trip to Western Europe. \u2026 In another sign of Walker's likely presidential run, he is expected to cut his participation in this week's trip short to join other GOP contenders for political events over the weekend in the key early primary state of New Hampshire. Walker will serve as the keynote speaker for the Republican Leadership Summit in Nashua on Saturday and meet with other Republicans from the state, including U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte.\u201d\n\n\n\n[\u2018What about your gaffes?\u2019 - Bloomberg honed in on one dropped \u201ce\u201d in Walker\u2019s use of German.]\n\n\n\nKelley Paul has advice for her husband: \u2018Open up\u2019 - WaPo: \u201cAs Rand Paul runs for president, wife Kelley Paul has a new role: helping soften the public image of her husband, an ophthalmologist who can be alternately prickly and blunt. Her prescription for the doctor: the policy is great - just add in some of the personal. She urged him to share a story on the trail about performing cataract surgery on a couple in Guatemala; after the operations, they could see one another clearly for the first time in years. \u2018He told me that and I started welling up, and so did he - and I was like, you need to share a little bit about who you are from the heart,\u2019 she said. \u2018So that\u2019s probably not his natural thing to put things like that in speeches.\u2019 Kelley, a writer and former marketing manager, has edited her husband\u2019s speeches since he ran for Senate in 2010.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Kelley Paul also heads to the Granite State today for a women\u2019s event and signing for her new book.]\n\n\n\nPOWER PLAY: THE SHRINKING GOP 2016 LAUNCH WINDOW\n\nWith Rubio, Cruz and Paul off and running the pressure is building on the rest of the GOP field to officially join the race.

I wouldn't have, because I wasn't ready.\u2019 When reporter Matt Bai asked Christie if he is ready for a 2016 run, the New Jersey governor quickly responded, \u2018Yes.\u2019 Christie said he could wait until June to make a final decision on whether or not he will run for the Republican presidential nominee.\u201d\n\n\n\n[Christie\u2019s New Hampshire swing started under a strain as he faced questions about looming potential federal corruption indictments.

Sen. Warren Limmer, R-Maple Grove, spoke in favor of striking the rule that bars senators from looking at one another during floor debate, requiring them to instead keep their eyes on the Senate president. \u2018I find this particular rule of the Senate, dare I say, antiquated,\u2019 Limmer said. However, Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk, D-Cook, said the rule is still relevant to the process. He said looking at one another during debates could cause deliberations to become personal. \u2018Our decorum would probably not be as Senate-like as we would like to have it\u2019 if the rule was changed, Bakk said. The Senate sided with Bakk in a 15-44 vote.\u201d\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News. Want FOX News First in your inbox every day?
