AGAWAM – Four people received awards at the 96th annual membership banquet of the Greater Springfield branch of the NAACP and one of them was its three-year president, the Rev. Talbert Swan.

“He has been a very active president,” said Sophia Jeffrey, a member of the awards committee.

She said Swan did not know prior to the banquet that he had been chosen for the award.

The others receiving awards were the Buffalo Soldiers Motorcycle Club of Springfield which was receiving an award for community service, Thomas Hodge, past president of the Vietnam Veterans of Greater Springfield, who was receiving an award for veterans services and William Bayman III, a student at Western New England University who was receiving an award for being a youth minister in his church.

The 96th anniversary membership banquet was held at Chez Josef.

Notable guests included a representative for Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno, Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse, State Sen. James Welch, D-West Springfield, State Rep. Benjamin Swan, D-Springfield, Governor’s Councilor Michael Albano and Springfield City Councilor Bud Williams.

Rev. Swan said the Greater Springfield NAACP is continuing to work against voter rights suppression, for President Obama’s Affordable Health Care Act and the expansion of Medicaid in southern states which have not expanded Medicaid, for limiting high powered magazines in the state and for strict background checks for gun ownership to keep people in all communities safer and against Stand Your Ground laws.

“We are fortunate with health care in Massachusetts,” Swan said. “The Affordable Health Care act was based upon the Massachusetts model.”

Swan said that between 300 and 500 people were expected to attend the dinner at Chez Josef.

The guest speaker was Kemba Smith Pradia, an author and voting rights advocate.
