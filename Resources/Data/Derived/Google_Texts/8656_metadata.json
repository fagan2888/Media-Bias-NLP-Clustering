The mandate compels religious groups to pay for birth control and drugs that may cause abortions.\n\nWithout relief, the Little Sisters would face millions of dollars in IRS fines because they cannot comply with the government\u2019s mandate that they give their employees free access to contraception, sterilization, and abortion-inducing drugs.\n\nPreviously, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily protected the Little Sisters from the mandate. The Little Sisters then went before the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver to extend that protection, but a panel of the appeals court ruled against them. Today, the full appeals court ruled in its favor.\n\nThe Tenth Circuit issued an order temporarily safeguarding the Little Sisters of the Poor and other ministries from being forced to violate their faith. The court\u2019s order means that the protection that the Supreme Court granted the Little Sisters last year will remain in place until the Supreme Court rules on their case.\n\nMark Rienzi, Senior Counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which represents the Little Sisters of the Poor, told LifeNews.com he\u2019s delighted by the decision.\n\nHe said: \u201cThe federal government doesn\u2019t need the Little Sisters or any other ministry to help it distribute abortion-inducing drugs and other contraceptives. Yet it not only insists on forcing them to participate in the delivery, it argues that their beliefs against participating are wrong and that government officials and judges can tell the Little Sisters what Catholic theology really requires. That\u2019s wrong, and it\u2019s dangerous \u2014 especially when those same government officials have disrespectfully compared the Sisters\u2019 beliefs to \u2018fighting an invisible dragon\u2019 that can be vanquished with the \u2018stroke of the [Sisters\u2019] own pen.'\u201d\n\nCLICK LIKE IF YOU\u2019RE PRO-LIFE!\n\nThe Little Sisters of the Poor, along with Reaching Souls International and several other ministries, have asked the Supreme Court to take their case and give them long-term relief from the government\u2019s mandate. The Supreme Court is expected to rule on that petition, along with several others, this fall.\n\nSr. Loraine Marie Maguire, Mother Provincial of the Little Sisters of the Poor responded to the appeals court ruling in an email to LifeNews.com: \u201cAs Little Sisters of the Poor, we simply cannot choose between our care for the elderly poor and our faith. And we should not have to make that choice, because it violates our nation\u2019s commitment to ensuring that people from diverse faiths can freely follow God\u2019s calling in their lives. For over 175 years, we have served the neediest in society with love and dignity. All we ask is to be able to continue our religious vocation free from government intrusion.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Supreme Court ruled that the Christian-run Hobby Lobby doesn\u2019t have to obey the HHS mandate that is a part of Obamacare that requires businesses to pay for abortion causing drugs in their employee health care plans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Appeals Court Says Obama Can't Force Little Sisters of the Poor to Obey HHS Mandate", "og": {"site_name": "LifeNews.com", "description": "In a victory for the pro-life fight against the HHS mandate, a federal appeals court issued a ruling today saying a Catholic religious order, the Little Sisters", "title": "Appeals Court Says Obama Can\u2019t Force Little Sisters of the Poor to Obey HHS Mandate", "url": "http://www.lifenews.com/2015/08/21/appeals-court-says-obama-cant-make-force-little-sisters-of-the-poor-obey-hhs-mandate/", "image": "http://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/littlesisters2.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 204509779594999}, "google-site-verification": "PPPx-GD0i7nWjUFAYnFdOYorAAJLuNyKOl23JCeXyrQ", "keywords": "appeals court says obama can\\'t force little sisters of the poor to obey hhs mandate", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The Little Sisters then went before the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver to extend that protection, but a panel of the appeals court ruled against them.\nPreviously, the U.S. Supreme Court temporarily protected the Little Sisters from the mandate.\nToday, the full appeals court ruled in its favor.\nThe court\u2019s order means that the protection that the Supreme Court granted the Little Sisters last year will remain in place until the Supreme Court rules on their case.\nHe said: \u201cThe federal government doesn\u2019t need the Little Sisters or any other ministry to help it distribute abortion-inducing drugs and other contraceptives."}
