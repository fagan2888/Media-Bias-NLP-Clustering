Badgers Chat Monday, Sept. 16\n\nUW FOOTBALL\n\nJeff Potrykus, beat writer\n\nRead Transcript\n\nBy of the\n\nTempe, Ariz. \u2014 Gary Andersen didn\u2019t lose his composure after his first loss at Wisconsin, a loss that was as controversial as it was stunning.\n\nYet as Andersen explained to reporters how he didn\u2019t receive a satisfactory explanation why the final 15 seconds ticked off the clock after quarterback Joel Stave knelt down at the Arizona State 15 to center the ball for a field-goal attempt, it was obvious he was steaming.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot to say,\u201d Andersen said after UW suffered a 32-30 loss when time expired after Stave lost 2 yards on the play.\n\nThe plan, according to Andersen and the players, was for UW to line up and spike the ball, a sequence the team works on every Friday in practice. But Stave bounced up too quickly, by his admission, and set the ball down on the ground.\n\nAlthough whistles were audible immediately after Stave set down the ball, Arizona State linebacker Anthony Jones jumped on the ball with 13 seconds left. Jones stayed on the ball until only four seconds remained on the clock.\n\nThe umpire spotted the ball with three seconds but didn\u2019t allow UW to line up over the ball until one second remaining.\n\nBy the time center Dallas Lewallen was able to snap the ball time had expired and the Sun Devils had prevailed.\n\n\u201cIt was a shame it went down the way it went down at the end,\u201d Andersen said, \u201cand that\u2019s really all I want to say about it. It is a shame it went down that way.\n\n\u201cWe (knee) it with 15 seconds left and never even got a chance to snap it again. I don\u2019t know how that happens.\u201d\n\nNeither did Stave, who completed 4 of 6 passes for 70 yards on the drive to move UW from its 17 to the Sun Devils' 13.\n\n\u201cI took a knee and set it down,\" said Stave, who asked the referee if the play could be reviewed. \"At the end I can\u2019t spot it myself I guess. I\u2019ve got to make sure I\u2019m hanging onto the ball and giving it to the ref...\n\n\u201cIt is a tough situation. I\u2019m not really sure what happened. I\u2019ve got to make sure I watch the film on that to make sure we\u2019re all learning from it.\n\n\u201cBecause we executed the drive like we wanted to. We\u2019ve got to make sure everything is precise.\u201d\n\nAndersen explained Stave attempted to run the play just as UW does each week in practice.\n\n\u201cAgain, there\u2019s 18 seconds left,\" Andersen said. \"The way we teach the kids to do it is center the football. His cleats slipped a little bit but he obviously centered the ball.\n\n\u201cHe put it there so the officials could get on the football and get us set so we have an opportunity to spike it.\n\n\"We practice that exact same scenario, with that time on the clock. And we would be worried that now we would have a kickoff coming our way.\u201d\n\nWhy didn't UW attempt a 30-yard field goal after Stave's 6-yard completion to Abbrederis with 18 seconds left?\n\n\u201cWe wanted to center it because it was the best place for Frenchie to kick the ball,\u201d Andersen said. \u201cWe felt like we had plenty of time.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like it was a stressful situation to get the ball centered and spike it.\n\n\u201cNo way that is a stressful play with 18 seconds left on the clock.\u201d\n\nAndersen was asked if he discussed the final sequence with the officials before they left the field.\n\n\u201cI got no answer,\u201d he said.\n\nAndersen's coaching career begain in 1988, when he was the assistant head coach and offensive coordinator at Southeastern Louisiana. He was asked if he had ever witnessed such an ending.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been part of one,\u201d Andersen said.\n\nSenior safety Dezmen Southward was asked the same question.\n\n\u201cNot in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cNot in my life.\u201d\n\nTight end Jacob Pedersen reiterated the plan was to center the ball for a spike and field-goal attempt. However, he still had no idea how the final seconds ticked away.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Pedersen said. \u201cThat\u2019s the answer I have for you guys. I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d\n\nAndersen was asked if he planned to pursue the matter in an attempt to get a clear explanation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where it goes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see. I\u2019d like to get an explanation. I wish I could have got one out there but I didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIt is just gut-wrenching when... you have to learn in these situations when they take something so special away from kids.\n\n\u201cOr at least an opportunity. Maybe we make the kick, maybe we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAndersen won\u2019t ever know what might have happened.", "article_metadata": {"title": "Amid confusion, Badgers' failure to stop clock leads to loss", "og": {"url": "http://www.jsonline.com/sports/badgers/amid-confusion-badgers-failure-to-stop-clock-leads-to-loss-b9998539z1-223796441.html", "image": {"width": 2048, "identifier": "http://media.jrn.com/images/33869867-mjs_uwgrid15__37_ofx_wood_uwgrid15(2).jpg", "height": 1366}, "type": "article", "description": "Trailing by two with 1:36 remaining, the Badgers drove to Arizona State's 13-yard line with 18 seconds remaining.
