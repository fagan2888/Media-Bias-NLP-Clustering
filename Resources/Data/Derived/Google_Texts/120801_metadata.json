He\u2019s doing that by alienating the world\u2019s Muslim population and making it harder for the U.S. to rally support among Arab countries to battle terrorists.\n\nRelated: Is Trump\u2019s Anti-Muslim Rhetoric Winning Him Support from Democrats?\n\nThe full-throated attacks against Trump at the Democratic debate in New Hampshire Saturday night made by former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley signal the growing recognition that the bombastic billionaire will likely sew up the GOP presidential nomination next year. Their comments also reflect the Democrats\u2019 undisguised glee that Trump will be the GOP\u2019s 2016 standard-bearer.\n\nWhile Trump has been pulverizing his Republican rivals in the national polls and many of the key statewide contests \u2013 with only Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida demonstrating the potential strength to overtake him \u2013 Trump\u2019s overall negatives are high and he does poorly in hypothetical matchups with Clinton and Sanders in the general election.\n\nIndeed, a new Fox News poll showing Trump leading the crowded field of GOP candidates nationally with 39 percent of the likely Republican vote also has him trailing Clinton by 11 points in a general election matchup, 49 percent to 38 percent. Just a month ago, Trump was leading Clinton in a similar matchup by five percentage points.\n\nAt least for now, Trump would make the weakest Republican nominee in the general election. By contrast, Rubio leads Clinton by two points (45 percent to 43 percent) in a hypothetical matchup while Cruz and Clinton are tied at 45 percent apiece among overall voters.\n\nRelated: Putin Would \u2018Welcome\u2019 a Donald Trump Presidency\n\nTrump has consistently stolen the spotlight from his Republican opponents with his over the top pronouncements and policies. He would bomb ISIS terrorists into oblivion and kill their families. He would bar most Muslims from entering the United States until the threat of additional domestic terrorism is brought under control. He would arrest and deport 11 million illegal immigrants in this country. He would build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and force the Mexican government to pay for it. And he would undo much of Obama\u2019s foreign policy deals \u2013 including the recent nuclear non-proliferation pact with Iran and a pending Asian trade agreement.\n\nTrump has also made fantastic or patently untrue statements, including, \u201cI watched thousands and thousands of Muslims in New Jersey cheer as the World Trade Center fell\u201d after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, and that Obama planned to admit 250,000 Syrian refugees into the country.\n\nTrump\u2019s bluster, dishonest rhetoric and reckless campaigning style have proved to be very useful to him in galvanizing a substantial share of the GOP\u2019s conservative base and Republican-leaning independents in the primaries and caucuses. But many Democratic and Republican leaders believe Trump\u2019s approach will discourage moderate party members, independents, Hispanics and minorities in a hard-fought general election campaign. Or at least that\u2019s what many are hoping.\n\n\u201cI think he would be wiped out in a general election,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), a GOP presidential candidate running near the back of the pack, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d program. \u201cHe has bits of populism but no consistent conservative philosophy.\u201d\n\nRelated: Brits Sign Petition to Ban Trump, Who Cameron Calls \u2018Divisive and Stupid\u2019\n\nSanders spelled out the ultimate Democratic critique of Trump during a post-debate appearance on the ABC News\u2019 This Week: \u201cI say this straight-forwardly, I think you have a pathological liar there.\u201d Sanders went on to say that Trump is \u201cplaying on the fears and anxieties of the American people\u201d regarding terrorism, the economy and massive income inequality in the U.S.\n\n\u201cSo instead of having a rational discussion about how we rebuild the middle class, how we deal with Wall Street, how we have a tax system in which the wealthiest start paying their fair share of taxes, what Trump is saying is that \u2018It\u2019s all the Muslims\u2019 fault, it\u2019s all the Mexicans\u2019 fault . . . because it\u2019s an easy solution.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what demagogues all over the world historically have done,\u201d he added.\n\nClinton strongly echoed this theme during the Democratic debate, saying, \u201cI worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States, and particularly around the world, that there is a clash of civilizations.\n\nShe added that Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim talk in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., \u201cfans the flames of radicalization\u201d and that \u201cHe is becoming ISIS\u2019s best recruiter.\u201d\n\nRelated: Sanders Accuses DNC Officials of Helping Clinton in Data Breach Lawsuit\n\nTrump, took umbrage over the way Sanders and Clinton characterized him during the two-hour Democratic debate in Manchester, N.H. He was especially piqued by Clinton\u2019s assertion that ISIS was using video of Trump\u2019s statements to incite Muslims against the United States.\n\nTrump quickly tweeted Saturday night that \u201cHillary Clinton lied\u201d about the ISIS videos, and he apparently was justified in his complaint. A spokesperson for Clinton\u2019s campaign told Chuck Todd on Sunday\u2019s Meet the Press they could cite no specific example of such an ISIS produced video.\n\nIn a separate interview Sunday with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, Trump repeated his attack on Clinton for making the unfounded claim that ISIS recruiters were using videos of Trump insulting Islam and Muslims. \u201cKnowing the Clintons and knowing Hillary, she made it up,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump then launched into a long, rambling discourse on world affairs and defense, berating Obama and Clinton for pursuing disastrous and stupid policies in the Middle East while heaping praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin after Putin publicly described Trump to reporters as a smart, tough leader.\n\nTrump said he thinks he would \u201cget along fine\u201d with Putin if he wins election, and seemed to go out of his way to defend Putin from criticism of ruthless international action, such as his invasion of the Ukraine, or his crackdown on domestic dissidents and journalists.\n\n\u201cIf Putin respects me and if Putin wants to call me brilliant . . . I\u2019ll accept that, and I\u2019ll accept it on behalf of our country,\u201d Trump said. Trump sharply criticized Obama\u2019s relationship with the Russian leader, saying that Putin \u201ccan\u2019t stand our president, and it\u2019s causing us difficulty.\u201d He insisted that Putin and the Russians \u201ccould be a strong ally for the U.S. in the fight against ISIS.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "We may have just seen the Democratic nominees opening salvo against Do", "title": "Democrats Attack Trump\u2014the Candidate They Hope Wins the GOP Nomination", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/21/Democrats-Attack-Trump-Candidate-They-Hope-Wins-GOP-Nomination", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12142015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/12/21/Democrats-Attack-Trump-Candidate-They-Hope-Wins-GOP-Nomination", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/12142015_Donald_Trump.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "We may have just seen the Democratic nominees opening salvo against Do", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "At least for now, Trump would make the weakest Republican nominee in the general election.\n\u201cI think he would be wiped out in a general election,\u201d Sen.
