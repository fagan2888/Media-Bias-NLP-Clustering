DULUTH, Minn. (NNCNOW.com) --- Groin Gate: That is the name some are calling Mike McFadden's newest television commercial.

McFadden is the leading Republican candidate running against Senator Al Franken (D-MN).

McFadden's first big ad buy shows the Republican as the coach of his Mendota Heights youth football team.

In the ad, the football players say "Obamacare needs to be sacked" and "Washington is fumbling our future."

At the end of the ad, McFadden tells the kids "Let's go out there and hit somebody."

A young football player then hits the U.S. Senate hopeful in what some think is his groin.

"Mike was punched in the stomach," Tom Erickson, McFadden's Communications Director said. "We are glad everyone is concerned about his well being."

"Mike does all his own stunts," Erickson said jokingly. "But, he is doing great and we are glad Minnesotans are talking about this ad."

The ad is McFadden's first big ad buy of the 2014 campaign and will cost six figures, according to the campaign.

The campaign said the ad will air in the Twin Cities, Mankato, Rochester, and Duluth television markets.

Although McFadden is the leading Republican to challenge Senator Al Franken this November, he does have a primary challenger.

Republican State Representative Jim Abeler will take on McFadden in the August primary.
