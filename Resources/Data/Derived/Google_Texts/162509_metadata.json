He estimated that he had sustained 10 concussions in his career, though his family said the number might have been even higher.\n\nBut off the field, he struggled with depression and substance abuse. His repeated injuries led him to retire from baseball early in 2010. One year ago, Freel, then 36, killed himself with a shotgun.\n\n\"I cringe when I see two guys going after the same ball.\"\n\nToday, he\u2019s become the first Major League Baseball player to be diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, after researchers at the Boston University School of Medicine released the results of a test on his brain tissue after his death.\n\nCNN\u2019s Stephanie Smith and Dan Moriarty explain that Freel\u2019s brain was in the moderate stage of the degenerative disease, which has recently become better-known for its possible connection to brain damage and suicides in former pro football players:\n\nTesting of his brain tissue after death \u2026 found that he had Stage 2 CTE, which is associated with erratic behavior and memory loss. Stage 4, the worst possible expression of the disease, is associated with full-blown dementia, aggression and paranoia. The brain tissue of people found to have CTE displays an abnormal build-up of tau\u2014a protein that, when it spills out of cells, can choke off, or disable, neural pathways controlling things like memory, judgment and fear.\n\nThe diagnosis of several NFL players with CTE has sparked widespread debate over the future of football. But Freel\u2019s case is interesting because it suggests that the disease can afflict even players of less-aggressive sports.\n\n\"I cringe when I see two guys going after the same ball,\" Robert Stern, co-founder of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at BU, told CNN. \"Is baseball as significant a concussion sport compared to others? No. Is it a concussion sport? Yes.\"\n\nMLB representatives have said that they are working to prevent further head injuries among players, including instituting a ban on home plate collisions that could start as early as 2014.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ryan Freel committed suicide after a career marked by blows to the head.", "author": "Olga Khazan", "og": {"site_name": "The Atlantic", "description": "Ryan Freel committed suicide after a career marked by blows to the head.", "title": "The First Baseball Player Diagnosed With Chronic Traumatic Brain Injury", "locale": "en_US", "image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2013/12/RTR1G6QM/lead_large.jpg", "url": "http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/the-first-baseball-player-to-be-diagnosed-with-chronic-traumatic-brain-injury/282390/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "theatlantic.com", "site": "@theatlantic", "card": "summary"}, "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "p": {"domain_verify": "68e1a0361a557708fefc992f3309ed70"}, "fb": {"admins": "577048155,17301937", "page_id": 29259828486, "app_id": 100770816677686}, "keywords": "The Atlantic, The Atlantic Magazine, TheAtlantic.com, Atlantic, news, opinion, breaking news, analysis, commentary, business, politics, culture, international, science, technology, national and life", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/olgakhazan"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, width=device-width, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Today, he\u2019s become the first Major League Baseball player to be diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, after researchers at the Boston University School of Medicine released the results of a test on his brain tissue after his death.\nThe diagnosis of several NFL players with CTE has sparked widespread debate over the future of football.\nStage 4, the worst possible expression of the disease, is associated with full-blown dementia, aggression and paranoia.\nHe estimated that he had sustained 10 concussions in his career, though his family said the number might have been even higher.\nBut Freel\u2019s case is interesting because it suggests that the disease can afflict even players of less-aggressive sports."}
