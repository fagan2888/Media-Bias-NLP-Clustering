Backstage at the festival, the Bad Boy chief explained his live performance philosophy to Billboard.

“I’m the ringmaster,” Puffy said. “It’s my job to bring out the lions and tigers, the bears, the surprises. Not only do I play my hits, I always like to bring out surprise guests.”

The hip-hop mogul also shared his thoughts on the countless artist collaborations heard on the radio today.

“I don’t want to do collaborations just because the record company wants you to do it and people think it’s hot,” he explains. “I just want to be real. So if I bump into Blake Shelton and we want to do a record, that’s the way it’ll be.”

Puffy says he’s “jaded” after having worked with superstars like Mariah Carey, Notorious B.I.G. and Mary J. Blige, and is more interested in working with unknown up-and-comers.

“The people I’d like to collaborate with, you guys probably wouldn’t know their names,” he said, adding that he doesn’t have anyone specifically in mind yet. “When I work with the next person I work with, I want it to be someone that I want to get into up close, because I like seeing things from far. I like seeing people grow.”
