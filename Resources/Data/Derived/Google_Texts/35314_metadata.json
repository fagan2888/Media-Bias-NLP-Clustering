It\u2019s Sunday. Be nice. I can't hear the TV if you yell.\n\nRELATED: Friday's complete scorelist.\n\nSecond, it has everything to do with being nice and playing fair. For the AISA, it\u2019s easy \u2013 everyone\u2019s on the road in Troy for the state championships. That includes Edgewood Academy, which has won something like a hundred-eleventy straight games.\n\nFor the AHSAA pairings, it\u2019s a little more complex. For this round, the team that traveled the most in the first two rounds gets to be home for the third round \u2013 even if they were the fourth seed. Think of it as Southern socialism or 100-yard Obamacare.\n\nRELATED: ASWA Top 10 football poll\n\nAhhh, but there are exceptions; pre-existing conditions if you will. If both teams have traveled an equal amount \u2013 both at home, on road or one of each \u2013 then the team on the bottom of the bracket pairing gets the home game. And if both teams are from the same region, the higher seed gets the concession stand money even if the other team has spent more time on the bus than Ralph Kramden (kids, ask your grandparents).\n\nRELATED: Rewinding Friday night's playoff action with Football High Live\n\nSo that\u2019s why your perfect team is on the road this week \u2013 or hosting, which ever you prefer.
