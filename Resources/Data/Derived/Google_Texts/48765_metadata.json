Senator John Cornyn delivered a keynote address on Saturday morning and Senator Ted Cruz followed later that afternoon. Both made remarks placing blame for partisan gridlock on Democratic leadership of the Senate, but it is their comments on the shutdown that are generating the buzz.\n\nIn response to a question about the upcoming 2016 presidential race, Cornyn observed that because of President Barack Obama\u2019s many missteps, it would be likely that other first term Senators would \u201chave a tougher time\u201d convincing the American people that they were ready to lead the country. Cornyn expanded on this, saying that it was imperative for the Republican Party overall to prove that they are capable of governing while they had this opportunity: the failures of the Obama administration had made voters across the political spectrum more receptive to considering voting Republican.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nHowever, Cornyn warned, the government shutdown that occurred in late September to early October last year was the type of tactic that should be avoided.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t turn out so well. What people want is for the government to function and not to throw temper tantrums and say we\u2019re not going to play ball,\u201d said Cornyn. There were audible gasps in the audience at this line, and the \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d quote in particular generated a lot of tweets. Cornyn did not specifically identify Cruz by name, but when an audience member asked him if he meant to include his fellow Texas Senator in his criticism, Cornyn responded, \u201camong others.\u201d\n\nCornyn also criticized the pressure exerted by \u201coutside groups\u201d on Republican Senators during the time period leading up to the shutdown, saying that their threats to negatively score a vote against the shutdown exerted undue pressure, especially on newer Senators.\n\nDuring Cruz\u2019s appearance later that day, he pushed back against the idea that he was against compromise, saying that he was not unwilling to make deals, but would not yield on core principles. \u201cI am absolutely happy to compromise if they are shrinking size and power of Washington,\u201d said Cruz, having previously called changing the \u201cfundamentally corrupt\u201d culture of Washington one of his main goals.\n\nCornyn and Cruz saved their harshest words for Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, with both Senators pointing out that over 350 bills had been passed by the House, but Reid had refused to allow votes on these bills or even allow them to be debated. Cornyn noted that the American people had a \u201ctremendous appetite\u201d for Congress to work together to solve the big issues, and praised how a Republican Congress and President Bill Clinton had worked together on a balanced budget, and how Democrat Speaker of the House Tip O\u2019Neill and President Ronald Reagan had worked to strengthen Social Security. Likewise, Cruz commented that he believed the American people would use the next election to end the partisan gridlock by putting new people in charge.\n\nBoth Senators were optimistic about their party\u2019s chances in the 2014 midterms and 2016 presidential elections, with Cornyn predicting a new slim but controlling Republican majority in the Senate, and Cruz directly comparing 2016 to Reagan\u2019s landslide defeat of President Jimmy Carter in 1980.\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Sarah Rumpf on Twitter at @rumpfshaker.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Texas Senators Still Trading Barbs Over Shutdown", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Texas Senators Still Trading Barbs Over Shutdown", "title": "Texas Senators Still Trading Barbs Over Shutdown - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/09/22/Cruz-Cornynjpg.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2014/09/22/texas-senators-still-trading-barbs-over-shutdown/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Texas Senators Still Trading Barbs Over Shutdown", "creator": "@rumpfshaker", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/09/22/Cruz-Cornynjpg.jpg", "title": "Texas Senators Still Trading Barbs Over Shutdown - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Senate, Ted Cruz, Twitter,Breitbart Texas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart Texas", "tag": "Twitter", "published_time": "2014-09-22T10:58:14-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERAUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Over the weekend, Texas\u2019 two senators traded barbs over the last year\u2019s government shutdown in a pair of speeches delivered at The Texas Tribune Festival, a conference at the University of Texas at Austin organized by the online media outlet.\nSenator John Cornyn delivered a keynote address on Saturday morning and Senator Ted Cruz followed later that afternoon.\nBoth made remarks placing blame for partisan gridlock on Democratic leadership of the Senate, but it is their comments on the shutdown that are generating the buzz.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERHowever, Cornyn warned, the government shutdown that occurred in late September to early October last year was the type of tactic that should be avoided.\nThere were audible gasps in the audience at this line, and the \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d quote in particular generated a lot of tweets."}
