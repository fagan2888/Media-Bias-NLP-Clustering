( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald )\n\nCity of Loveland and Larimer County clerks met Friday to finalize details in both upcoming elections.\n\nTwo ballots and envelopes, one from the city of Loveland and one from Larimer County, will both be sent out to eligible voters at the beginning of June and are due back by June 24, election day.\n\nThe blue envelope is for the registered voters in Loveland city limits and contains a ballot addressing the issue of a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing. It will be sent out Tuesday. Those blue Loveland envelopes must be returned to Loveland City Hall, 500 E. Third St.\n\nThe white envelope contains the primary ballot for Larimer County. It will be sent out June 2 to registered Republicans, Democrats and American Constitution Party members. Unaffiliated voters will not receive a primary ballot. Larimer County ballots, in the white envelopes, must be returned to drop locations listed at votelarimer.org.\n\nBoth ballots are due June 24, but they cannot be returned to the same location or in one envelope. If the ballots are returned in the same envelope, neither vote will be counted.\n\nBoth ballots can be returned by mail, but they will only be counted if they are received by 7 p.m. June 24.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We have no leeway where that's concerned,\" Loveland City Clerk Terry Andrews said. \"They must be in our office by 7 o'clock.\"\n\nIf the ballots are left in the wrong drop boxes, the clerks said they will work to get them to the right place, but there is no guarantee they will be collected in time.\n\n\"The faster they vote, the fewer calls they will have from people interested in any of the campaigns because they don't call people who have already voted,\" Larimer County clerk and recorder Angela Myers said.\n\nContact Reporter-Herald Staff Writer Cassa Niedringhaus at 970-635-3651 or at news@reporter-herald.com.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/election/ci_25874574/clerks-hope-head-off-ballot-confusion", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0531/20140531__01RHABALLOT~2_300.jpg", "sailthru.author": "By Cassa Niedringhaus  Reporter-Herald Staff Writer", "description": "City of Loveland and Larimer County clerks met Friday to finalize details in both upcoming elections.", "ag": {"canon": "LovelandReporter-Herald:article:25874574:view"}, "startDate": "2014-06-01T08:17:02-0600", "og": {"url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/election/ci_25874574/clerks-hope-head-off-ballot-confusion", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0531/20140531__01RHABALLOT~1.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "City of Loveland and Larimer County clerks met Friday to finalize details in both upcoming elections.", "title": "Clerks hope to head off ballot confusion"}, "twitter": {"domain": "reporterherald.com", "description": "City of Loveland and Larimer County clerks met Friday to finalize details in both upcoming elections.", "title": "Clerks hope to head off ballot confusion", "url": "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/election/ci_25874574/clerks-hope-head-off-ballot-confusion", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0531/20140531__01RHABALLOT~1.jpg", "site": "@reporterherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2014-06-01T08:17:02-0600", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "sailthru.title": "Clerks hope to head off ballot confusion", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site47/2014/0531/20140531__01RHABALLOT~2.jpg", "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "sailthru.section": "Election", "google-site-verification": "XzsHDcJw4iXBQEYtDXFRaUAdKzxhSvxWMgXyQQNFFzg", "modificationDate": "2014-06-01T08:17:15-0600", "endDate": "2024-06-01T08:17:02-0600", "byline": "By Cassa Niedringhaus", "sailthru.site": "reporterherald.com", "pubDate": "2014-06-01T08:17:52-0600", "news_keywords": "Loveland Colorado ReporterHerald elections politics campaigns PACs issues committees initiatives ballot vote"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe04a5\"", "article_summary": "( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald )City of Loveland and Larimer County clerks met Friday to finalize details in both upcoming elections.\nThose blue Loveland envelopes must be returned to Loveland City Hall, 500 E.
