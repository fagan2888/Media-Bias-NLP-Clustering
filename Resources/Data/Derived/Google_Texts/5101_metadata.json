A five-year-old girl from Newport, South Wales, was removed from her home and taken into custody after it was reported that she weighed over 143 lbs.\n\n\u201cThis is the tip of the iceberg,\u201d Tam Fry from the Child Growth Foundation told the Daily Mail. \u201cThere will be an enormous amount of children overweight, possibly dangerously overweight, where even the parents don\u2019t recognize it.\u201d\n\nAccording to a Freedom of Information Act request, weighing around 65 kg (143 lbs.), the unidentified girl was removed from her house in August of last year. Two months after she was taken into custody, the girl\u2019s weight rose to 150 lbs. but dropped down to 112 lbs. that September. One hundred and forty-three pounds is the heaviest a male or female 5-year-old child has weighed in an English school since 2008.\n\nBritish lawmakers and child protection services are trying to figure out how the child\u2019s weight went unnoticed by relatives and people close to the family. Officials on the Newport city council said the child\u2019s obesity was the only reason she was taken into custody. A healthy 5-year-old girl usually weighs between 45 to 50 lbs.\n\n\u201cWe are failing our children hugely by not monitoring their growth from a very early age. About 25 percent of our primary school entrants are seriously overweight,\u201d Fry told the Daily Mail. \u201cIt just throws up a whole problem of people wishing not to mention weight in case it upsets the parents or upsets the child.\u201d\n\nOver 40 million children under the age of 5 were considered overweight back in 2011, the World Health Organization reports. Overweight children are at risk of psychological disorders, cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, hypertension, and premature death. To calculate an individual\u2019s body mass index (BMI), health care professionals divide the person\u2019s weight in kilograms by their height in meters.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "childhood, obesity, britain's, heaviest, 5, year, old", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Britain's heaviest five-year-old has been taken out of the care of her parents in hopes of curbing her obesity.", "title": "143-Pound 5-Year-Old Girl Is Taken Away From Parents", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/143-pound-5-year-old-girl-taken-away-parents-heaviest-child-ever-recorded-three-times-normal-weight", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/09/childhood-obesity.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Britain's heaviest five-year-old has been taken out of the care of her parents in hopes of curbing her obesity.", "title": "143-Pound 5-Year-Old Girl Is Taken Away From Parents", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/143-pound-5-year-old-girl-taken-away-parents-heaviest-child-ever-recorded-three-times-normal-weight", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/09/childhood-obesity.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/12/09/childhood-obesity.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "US/World", "published_time": "2013-12-09T14:10:08-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-12-09T14:10:07-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Britain's heaviest five-year-old has been taken out of the care of her parents in hopes of curbing her obesity."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc976f\"", "article_summary": "Overweight children are at risk of psychological disorders, cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, hypertension, and premature death.\nOne hundred and forty-three pounds is the heaviest a male or female 5-year-old child has weighed in an English school since 2008.\nTwo months after she was taken into custody, the girl\u2019s weight rose to 150 lbs.\nA five-year-old girl from Newport, South Wales, was removed from her home and taken into custody after it was reported that she weighed over 143 lbs.\nOfficials on the Newport city council said the child\u2019s obesity was the only reason she was taken into custody."}
