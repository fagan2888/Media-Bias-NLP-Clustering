Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Al Khamenei reportedly sent a secret letter to President Obama responding to requests the president made amid nuclear talks.

Iran’s spiritual leader wrote to Obama in recent weeks to respond to a presidential letter sent in October that suggested the possibility of U.S.-Iranian cooperation in fighting the Islamic State is a nuclear deal was reached, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing an Iranian diplomat with knowledge of the letter.

Mr. Khamenei’s letter was “respectful” but noncommittal, the diplomat told The Journal.

The cleric said earlier this week that he could accept a compromise in the nuclear talks and supported Iranian President Hassan Rouhani’s decision to negotiate with the West.

The U.S., Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany hope to reach a deal with Iran that would ease concerns that Tehran could build up a secret nuclear weapons program. In return for such a deal, western powers would lift sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy.

Western officials are aiming to agree on the terms of a deal by March, with a final deadline for the accord set for June 30.

Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to address the U.S. Congress next month on the Iranian deal, and has vowed to “foil this bad and dangerous agreement” Yahoo news reported.
