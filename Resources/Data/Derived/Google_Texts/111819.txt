The Virginia Department of Health and Walgreens are teaming up to offer free HIV tests.

The health department says Walgreens pharmacists will administer the tests in private consultation rooms and consumers can obtain test results in as little as one minute.

The tests are available daily at Walgreens locations including Alexandria, Danville, Fredericksburg, Hopewell, Manassas, Martinsville, Reston, Richmond and Williamsburg. They'll be offered at no charge through the year 2016.

In support of National HIV Testing Day on Friday, the tests will also be available at Walgreens stores in additional cities, including D.C. from June 26 to June 28.

Of the more than 1.1 million people living with HIV in the U.S., an estimated one in six do not know that they are infected, and only one in four has their virus under control with treatment.
