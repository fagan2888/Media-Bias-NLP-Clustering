What follows is an exclusive report on the first 100 days that followed his fabulous inauguration and after-party (attended by thousands of beautiful women with beautiful faces) as he set off on a short road to making America great again.\n\nDay 1. Even as President Trump orders federal workers to bundle the inaugural ball\u2019s gold foil confetti for smelting and reuse in White House restroom faucets, he begins making good on his campaign vow to seal the U.S.-Mexico border \u201con my first day.\u201d\n\nRefusing to let supporters hold hands along the border, Red Rover style, to prevent immigrants from crossing over, germophobe Trump orders the National Guard to douse the border in gasoline, set it afire and maintain the blaze.\n\nHe proclaims the conflagration, which is visible from space, to be \u201cspectacular.\u201d\n\nRecognizing how costly buying petroleum to feed the flames will be over time, and needing money to fulfill his pledges to dramatically increase military spending, finance a multi-trillion dollar tax cut and offer \u201cfantastic\u201d universal health care, Trump starts construction of a 2,000-mile \u201cbeautiful\u201d border wall, to be paid for entirely by the Mexican government.\n\nHe specifies that the wall be built with only \u201cthe finest materials\u201d and topped with \u201cgold-plated razor wire.\u201d When Trump insists on a fringe of rich Corinthian leather, Treasury Secretary Martha Stewart apologetically informs the President that there is no such thing.\n\nFor Mexico\u2019s \u201cconvenience,\u201d Trump says he will accept $40 billion in a \u201cterrifically\u201d structured balloon mortgage.\n\nSimultaneously, the President moves to debunk fears that he intends to brutally uproot and deport 11 million undocumented residents \u2014 and send them back to their home countries in cattle cars. Stretch limousines and well-dressed men with Tasers begin appearing in American cities.\n\n\u201cWe have just begun the fastest, classiest mass deportation in world history,\u201d Trump declares.\n\nDay 2. When Secretary of State Arnold Schwarzenegger reports that Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto laughed in his face about paying for the $40 billion wall, Trump tears up the North American Free Trade Agreement on live television.\n\nHe also puts in a call to Chinese President Xi Jinping, telling Xi that he has really enjoyed negotiating office leases with Chinese businessmen because while they are smart, he is smarter.\n\n\u201cFor us to have good international relations, it\u2019s only gentlemanly for me to let you to know who you\u2019re dealing with,\u201d Trump says, before informing Xi that, as promised in the campaign, he is imposing massive new import duties on Chinese-made goods, illegal under World Trade Organization agreements.\n\nChina retaliates by doubling tariffs on soybeans and semiconductors, two of America\u2019s top exports, and floods the market with cheap steel. Mexico hikes tariffs on its $200 billion in U.S. imports. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plummets by 52%.\n\n\u201cStocks are cheaper than they have ever been,\u201d Trump declares. \u201cI\u2019ve given the American people the greatest opportunity to buy low that they have ever had in recorded history. Once, China and Mexico were so smart compared to how stupid we used to be. Now, they\u2019re so stupid compared to how smart we are. Call your stockbrokers. You\u2019ll win so big it will make your head spin.\u201d\n\nStaying awake into the early morning hours, Trump Twitter-flames Xi as \u201cugly and low-energy,\u201d and Pe\u00f1a Nieto as \u201cdecent looking, but a loser.\u201d\n\nAt dawn, Trump orders a fireworks display.\n\nDay 7. Following the first full week of construction, 100 miles of border wall are complete, and only four workers have died in the flames. Trump orders a fireworks display.\n\nDay 9. The President names the rest of his cabinet. He says it is the best looking cabinet in the history of the Republic. The group photo is truly stunning.\n\nDay 13. Trump\u2019s tax plan \u2014 which includes huge across-the-board rate reductions and elimination of the estate tax \u2014 hits resistance in Congress from Republicans concerned about increasing the federal deficit by $12 trillion over 10 years, and Democrats worried about dramatically slashing the rates of the wealthiest Americans.\n\nThe President makes a trip to Capitol Hill. In stirring remarks, he reminds Senate and House leaders that he once finished the construction of an ice skating rink and had a hit reality TV show in which he portrayed a man far wealthier and more successful than himself.\n\nCongress tells Trump that at the moment, it\u2019s pretty damn busy with crop-subsidy legislation, but would take up his plan as soon as they worked out a sugar beet formula.\n\nTrump orders a fireworks display.\n\nBy order of the President Trump, the Obama Library is relocated to Nairobi, Kenya. (DOMINICK REUTER/REUTERS)\n\nDay 15. Giddy at Washington\u2019s apparent appreciation of his art of the deal, Trump orders Surgeon General Dr. Mehmet Oz to get to work on a health insurance plan to replace Obamacare. He demands the legislation use the exact words \u201csomething terrific.\u201d\n\nDay 19. On the eve of the President\u2019s first press conference, he stays up into the early morning hours angrily responding to criticism of his administration. He deems the offenders, including White House correspondents from the New York Times, the Washington Post, ABC and CBS, \u201camong the worst people I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d He purges them from the Briefing Room for the remainder of his administration.\n\nStanding with Attorney General Rudy Giuliani, Trump launches a Justice Department Division of Moron Pundit Prosecution.\n\n\u201cMy enemies list,\u201d Trump says at the podium, \u201cis going to be the biggest, best enemies list you have ever seen.\u201d\n\nDay 22. With Russia overrunning Syria, Bashar Assad making the Damascus nightclub scene and ISIS recruiting ever more foreign fighters, Trump hires a Rosetta Stone official to help him memorize and pronounce the names of key players in the Middle East. In the Situation Room, he assembles the Gen. Patton and the Gen. MacArthur he had promised would lead the Pentagon and asks them to pick between his two announced strategy choices.\n\nOption One: \u201cKnock the hell out of them,\u201d as he said while campaigning. Option Two: Let Vladimir Putin take over, because, as he said while campaigning, \u201cI love the fact that ISIS is being hit by Russia \u2026 Why do we have to do everything?\u201d There\u2019s a long pause.\n\nIn an evening address to the American people, Trump explains: \u201cAfter flipping a big, beautiful coin, I have decided to follow through on the first idea I came up with, which is to send ground troops to attack oil fields, and then keep them there until we get all the money.\u201d\n\nHe says calling the fight the \u201cWar for Oil\u201d has a certain ring to it, and orders a fireworks display.\n\nDay 25. Making good on another promise, Trump sends all 10,000 Syrian refugees admitted by the Obama administration back to their war-ravaged country. As a consolation, he gives each one a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d cap.\n\nDay 30. President Trump\u2019s Department of Labor releases its first jobs report. America has created an unprecedented 1 million new jobs in just one month. All but 23 are Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation officers.\n\nDay 44. The 1,111th mile of the border wall is complete, as is the \u201cbig, beautiful door\u201d the President had promised. The U.S. Mint produces a platinum key for that door, which Trump wears around his neck, behind his Trump Signature Collection tie.\n\nDay 64. Nine million immigrants have been deported, but birthright citizenship remains the law of the land. The states are balking at amending the Constitution to repeal the 14th Amendment. No matter.\n\nTrump begins revoking the citizenship of thousands of onetime \u201canchor babies,\u201d and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Greta Van Susteren deems birthright citizenship \u201cthe worst interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment in the history of interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d\n\nTrump orders a fireworks display.\n\nDay 70. Exercising the power of eminent domain, Trump seizes the land under the Obama Presidential Library in Chicago to build a combined Trump Casino-Trump University where, he pledges, professors will give the \u201cgreatest ever courses in playing roulette to low-income Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guarantee you, you will win,\u201d the President says. Secretary of Commerce Dennis Rodman, standing by his side, whispers, \u201cThat is not a guarantee.\u201d\n\nBy order of the President, the Obama Library is relocated to Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nDay 82. At a record-size military graduation, part of Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cmake our military so big and so strong and so great \u2026 that nobody\u2019s going to mess with us,\u201d the commander-in-chief tells cadets that he has \u201calways felt like one of you\u201d and \u201cgot more training than a lot of you.\u201d He also warns they better not be so stupid as to get captured.\n\nApplause is muted, and a few cadets leave after an attempted Trump applause line on the War for Oil.\n\nDay 87. The President celebrates completion of the final mile of the 1,954-mile border wall, which comes in 1 million pesos (about $60,000) under budget. While marking the occasion with a stirring speech calling Americans to a new era of division, inwardness and fear, he proudly proclaims the savings will go toward adding his visage and hair to Mount Rushmore.\n\nDay 94. Trump announces that he has completed his first 100 days ahead of schedule. He orders a fireworks display.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Josh Greenman", "twitter": {"description": "What follows is an exclusive report on the first 100 days that followed Donald Trump's inauguration and after-party", "title": "Josh Greenman: President Trump's first 100 days", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/future-president-trump-100-days-article-1.2384306", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2384331.1443908659!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/graphic-mountrushmore-1002.jpg", "site": "@nydailynews", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Josh Greenman", "parsely-type": "article", "sailthru.credits": "NEW YORK DAILY NEWS", "nydn_tags": "donald trump", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-10-03T21:32:20", "parsely-link": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/future-president-trump-100-days-article-1.2384306", "parsely-title": "Josh Greenman: President Trump's first 100 days", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-03T17:32:20-0400", "sailthru.title": "Josh Greenman: President Trump's first 100 days", "nydn_section": "Opinion", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2384331.1443908659!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/graphic-mountrushmore-1002.jpg", "description": "What follows is an exclusive report on the first 100 days that followed Donald Trump's inauguration and after-party", "robots": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"admins": 1594068001, "app_id": 107464888913, "pages": 268914272540}, "msvalidate.01": "02916AAC0DA8B068EFE01D721E03ED7E", "parsely-section": "Opinion", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NYDailyNews/"}, "sailthru.description": "What follows is an exclusive report on the first 100 days that followed Donald Trump's inauguration and after-party", "viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"site_name": "NY Daily News", "description": "What follows is an exclusive report on the first 100 days that followed Donald Trump's inauguration and after-party", "title": "Josh Greenman: President Trump's first 100 days", "url": "http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/future-president-trump-100-days-article-1.2384306", "image": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2384331.1443908659!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/graphic-mountrushmore-1002.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-tags": "donald trump", "p": {"domain_verify": "78efe4f5c9935744af497772f68a0ee7"}, "nydn_byline": "Josh Greenman", "parsely-image-url": "http://assets.nydailynews.com/polopoly_fs/1.2384331.1443908659!/img/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_1200/graphic-mountrushmore-1002.jpg"}, "article_summary": "Following the first full week of construction, 100 miles of border wall are complete, and only four workers have died in the flames.\nHe also puts in a call to Chinese President Xi Jinping, telling Xi that he has really enjoyed negotiating office leases with Chinese businessmen because while they are smart, he is smarter.\nBy order of the President Trump, the Obama Library is relocated to Nairobi, Kenya.\nThe 1,111th mile of the border wall is complete, as is the \u201cbig, beautiful door\u201d the President had promised.\nThe President celebrates completion of the final mile of the 1,954-mile border wall, which comes in 1 million pesos (about $60,000) under budget."}
