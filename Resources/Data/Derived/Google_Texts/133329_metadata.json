He also called on South Dakota to \u201csend a symbolic message that liberty shall be the law of the land.\u201d\n\nThe Argus Leader reported that some other delegates disagreed with the resolution \u2014 David Wheeler of Beadle County said it would make the convention \u201clook petty, like we can\u2019t achieve our political goals through the political process\u201d \u2014 but ultimately it passed with a respectable majority of 191 to 176 votes.\n\nOther voices in South Dakota state politics were not amused.\n\n\u201cThe South Dakota Republican Party has had many opportunities to put working families and the middle class first, but instead they want to impeach the President,\u201d South Dakota Democratic Party Chair Deb Knecht said in a statement yesterday. She also called on Rep. Kristi Noem (R-SD) and Sen. John Thune (R-SD) to reject the resolution.\n\nNoem herself spoke before South Dakota\u2019s Republican convention just hours before the resolutions were voted on. Afterwards, her office released a statement that \u201cthe best way for Congress to hold the president accountable is to continue aggressive committee oversight and investigations into the administration\u2019s actions.\u201d\n\nThe idea of impeaching the President has been floating around Republican circles across the country for a while now. Just this past week, Huffington Post reported that Rep. Lou Barletta (R-PA) mused that the House could \u201cprobably\u201d muster the votes to impeach Obama if the vote was brought to the floor. \u201cHe\u2019s just absolutely ignoring the Constitution and ignoring the laws and ignoring the checks and balances,\u201d Barletta said on the Gary Sutton\u2019s radio show, following a discussion of immigration.\n\nBack in 2013, Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) made sure that every member of the House of Representatives was sent a copy of the book \u201cImpeachable Offenses: The case for removing Barack Obama from office\u201d by Aaron Klein and Brenda J. Elliott. Rep. Blake Farenthold (R-TX) told his constituents that \u201cif we were to impeach the president tomorrow, you could probably get the votes in the House of Representatives to do it,\u201d while Rep. Kerry Bentivolio (R-MI) said at an event that impeachment \u201cwould be a dream come true.\u201d And just this past April, Sam Clovis, an Iowa Republican who was aiming to be the party\u2019s candidate for one of the state\u2019s two Senate seats, asserted that impeachment was justified but unlikely to succeed only because Obama is black.\n\nStockman himself once threatened to bring articles of impeachment to the floor if Obama used his executive authority to enact measures to prevent gun violence \u2014 a point on which he was joined by Rep. Trey Radel (R-FL) and Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) \u2014 while Texas Lieutenant Governor David Dewhurst said Obama \u201cought to be impeached\u201d over the Benghazi scandal.\n\nOther reasons for impeaching Obama that Congressional Republicans have put forward include forcing the President to show his birth certificate, for not defending the Defense of Marriage Act in court, and as a threat to prevent the federal government from defaulting.\n\nIn the United States, articles of impeachment against a president or other government official must first pass the House by a simple majority vote. This means the official has been \u201cimpeached,\u201d but it remains up to the Senate to decide by a two-thirds majority vote whether the accused is actually guilty of the charges brought by the articles.\n\nOnly two presidents have ever been successfully impeached by the House: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Both were ultimately acquitted when the Senate vote fell short of the two-thirds requirement.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The state convention of South Dakota's GOP passed a resolution on Saturday by 191 to 176 votes, calling for the impeachment of President Barack Obama.
