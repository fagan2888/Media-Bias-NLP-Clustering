Yet she has already seen, experienced and done more than most of us ever will in a lifetime.\n\nThis young activist has fought an inspirational battle for girls\u2019 education rights in Pakistan. Malala\u2019s unwavering support for the important principles of liberty, democracy and freedom has inspired many people. She has also become a prime target for radical extremists and terrorist groups, and put her life in great jeopardy.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes her autobiography, \u201cI Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and was Shot by the Taliban,\u201d so compelling. It\u2019s a brave girl\u2019s tale in an unsafe country, and it reveals her fierce determination to make the world a better place.\n\nMalala\u2019s story begins in what she described as \u201cthe most beautiful place in all the world the Swat Valley, is a heavenly kingdom of mountains, gushing waterfalls and crystal-clear lakes.\u201d She was named after Malalai of Maiwand, \u201cthe greatest heroine of Afghanistan\u201d who \u201cinspired the Afghan army to defeat the British in 1880 in one of the biggest battles of the Second Anglo-Afghan War.\u201d Her family, who is of Pashtun origin, lived in the valley\u2019s largest town, Mingora.\n\nZiauddin, her father, studied at Swat\u2019s Jehanzeb College and worked as an English teacher. An education reformer, he \u201clonged for the freedom that would come with running his own school.\u201d In particular, Ziauddin \u201cwanted to encourage independent thought and hated the way the school he was in rewarded obedience above open-mindedness and creativity.\u201d With the help of a friend, he founded the Khushal Public School to do just that.\n\nIt\u2019s quite clear where Malala\u2019s independent spirit comes from. Her involvement in politics and activism in the face of the Taliban\u2019s looming presence comes from her father\u2019s advice and encouragement. As she writes, \u201cMy father used to say, \u2018I will protect your freedom, Malala. Carry on with your dreams.\u2019 \u201c\n\nHer dream came to fruition quite by accident.\n\nAbdul Hai Kakar, a Peshwar-based BBC radio correspondent, was searching for a \u201cfemale teacher or a schoolgirl to write a diary about life under the Taliban.\u201d The first girl chosen was \u201cMadam Maryam\u2019s younger sister Ayesha but her father found out and refused permission saying it was too risky.\u201d\n\nWhen Malala heard her father discussing this issue, she piped up, \u201cWhy not me?\u201d She ultimately worked out an arrangement with Hai Kakar to speak on the phone between 30-45 minutes in Urdu. He would write up their conversation \u201cand once a week they would appear on the BBC Urdu website.\u201d\n\nMalala refers to Anne Frank\u2019s book and experience hiding from the Nazis in Holland as a \u201cvery powerful record\u201d \u2014 and, one assumes, an inspiration for her own diary. To protect her identity, Hai Kakar suggested the pseudonym Gul Makai, \u201cwhich means \u2018cornflower\u2019 and is the name of the heroine in a Pashtun folk story.\u201d With her first entry on Jan. 3, 2009 titled \u201cI Am Afraid,\u201d a new chapter in her life began.\n\nThe book\u2019s strongest sections pertain to her growth as an activist. Malala\u2019s Web diary quickly became a popular destination on BBC Urdu, especially her strong position on the importance of education for girls. In her view, the \u201cTaliban is against education because they think when a child reads a book or learns English or studies science he or she will become Westernized.\u201d Yet as she correctly points out, \u201c[e]ducation is neither Eastern nor Western, it is human.\u201d\n\nHer public stature increased, as did the Taliban\u2019s terrorist rage. On Oct. 9, 2012, several gunmen boarded her school bus and demanded to know, \u201cWho is Malala?\u201d They attempted to assassinate her; one bullet passed through her forehead and barely missed her brain. Malala was eventually flown out of Pakistan to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, England, for successful reconstructive surgery. She still lives there.\n\nThe assassination plot turned out to be a tactical error. \u201cI realized what the Taliban had done,\u201d Malala writes, \u201cwas make my campaign global.\u201d The Pakistani government condemned the Taliban for this attack, and searched for her attackers. Malala has since won many awards, spoken in front of the United Nations, and was nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nMalala\u2019s campaign to educate young Pakistani girls is gradually winning hearts and minds. While there\u2019s still a long way to go, real progress has been made. She should be proud of her efforts and accomplishments. Let\u2019s hope her book will inspire others to fight for freedom and democracy, too.\n\nMichael Taube is a contributor to The Washington Times.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Malala Yousafzai is only 16 years old.
