The most common reason they disagreed with patient participation was concern about negative effects on relationships with patients.\n\nOther reasons included an increase in workload, patients\u2019 lack of knowledge, concerns about legal problems and concern that their authority would be undermined.\n\nIf patients were going to participate, then doctors and nurses would prefer to be asked directly to wash their hands. But patients and their families preferred to assess healthcare workers\u2019 hand washing when they were discharged or periodically during their hospital stay, rather than asking health workers directly.\n\nDr. Nasia Safdar, who was not involved in the study, said that patients and providers agree hand hygiene is important, but they disagree on the best way to promote it.\n\n\u201cPatient involvement and perceptions, as well as those of providers, are very culturally specific, so findings in one setting are not necessarily generalizable,\u201d Safdar told Reuters Health in an email.\n\nSafdar, a researcher at the University of Wisconsin Department of Medicine, said she believes both doctors and patients would feel comfortable if the patients had the option of reminding staff to wash their hands.\n\nHand washing is \u201ccritical for the prevention of infection,\u201d she added.\n\nSOURCE: http://bit.ly/1LiMzVW American Journal of Infection Control, online March 6, 2015.\n\n(By Shereen Lehman)", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "should, patients, remind, health, workers, wash, their, hands", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Many patients are willing to remind health workers to wash their hands, in the interest of reducing the spread of infection.", "title": "Should Patients Remind Health Workers To Wash Their Hands?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/should-patients-remind-health-workers-wash-their-hands-326570", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/22/hand-washing.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many patients are willing to remind health workers to wash their hands, in the interest of reducing the spread of infection.", "title": "Should Patients Remind Health Workers To Wash Their Hands?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/should-patients-remind-health-workers-wash-their-hands-326570", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/22/hand-washing.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/03/22/hand-washing.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-03-22T08:33:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-22T08:33:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Many patients are willing to remind health workers to wash their hands, in the interest of reducing the spread of infection."}, "article_summary": "Many patients are willing to remind health workers to wash their hands, in the interest of reducing the spread of infection.\n(Reuters Health) - Most patients are willing to remind health care workers to wash their hands while in the hospital, suggests a new study from South Korea.\nBut patients and their families preferred to assess healthcare workers\u2019 hand washing when they were discharged or periodically during their hospital stay, rather than asking health workers directly.\nSeventy-five percent of patients and 84 percent of their families wished to ask health care workers to wash their hands if they had not already washed them.\nIf patients were going to participate, then doctors and nurses would prefer to be asked directly to wash their hands."}
