If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also.\u201d\n\n\u2013 John 15:20\n\nChristians, pastors, take heed. In case you haven\u2019t noticed, times are a-changin\u2019. Whether at home or abroad, if you follow God\u2019s command to speak biblical truth in all things, most especially, it seems, on matters of sex and sexuality, you will be persecuted.\n\n\u201cA servant is not greater than his master.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t presume to compare my friend Scott Lively of Abiding Truth Ministries to Jesus Christ. None of us can compare, even remotely, to the one and only God-man \u2013 to the Lord of the universe and exclusive path to eternal salvation. That said, Pastor Lively is one of the most \u201cChrist-like\u201d people I\u2019ve had the honor to know.\n\nAs did Christ, Scott Lively speaks absolute truth, in absolute love, with absolutely no fear of personal destruction or even death. He loves everyone, whether friend or foe, Christian or pagan, straight or \u201cgay.\u201d\n\nFor example, Scott and his family took into their home and nursed, both physically and spiritually, the late Sonny Weaver, a former homosexual who died, as so many have, from AIDS \u2013 a natural consequence of unnatural behavior. Sonny became homosexual after being raped at 7 years old by a \u201cgay\u201d man in a local YMCA. He became a former homosexual after accepting Jesus as Lord of his life.\n\nLively loves those who seek to defend him just as he loves those who seek to destroy him \u2013 and, make no mistake about it, precisely because Pastor Scott Lively has chosen to both obey and emulate Jesus Christ, there are people, very powerful people, who seek to destroy him. These people, unless and until they come to know, accept and surrender to the Lord Jesus, are, and will remain, enemies of God.\n\nAnd so Scott Lively prays for them.\n\nRemember those pastors in Houston who were told to turn over their sermons to radical lesbian-activist mayor Annise Parker? Remember the national outrage over this blatantly unconstitutional act of governmental abuse?\n\nYou ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet.\n\nPastor Lively, you see, has, in the spirit of Saul Alinsky, been \u201cHitlerized\u201d by a left-wing extremist group ironically calling itself the \u201cCenter for Constitutional Rights\u201d (CCR). CCR is a George Soros-funded organization with, I kid you not, the beastly street address of 666 Broadway, New York, NY.\n\nBecause Lively exercised his God-given First Amendment rights, as well as his free-speech rights afforded by the laws of Uganda, and spoke biblical truth about homosexual sin after having been invited there by a number of Ugandan pro-family groups, homosexual activists set-out to make an example of him.\n\nIn March of 2012 CCR sued Lively in a Massachusetts federal court for \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d \u2013 the same charge filed against Nazis who stood trial in Nuremberg \u2013 on behalf of another moonbat organization called \u201cSexual Minorities Uganda,\u201d which, and again, you can\u2019t make this stuff up, prefers the moniker \u201cSMUG.\u201d\n\nAnd so Lively enlisted the pro-bono legal services of Liberty Counsel, one of America\u2019s fastest-growing civil rights organizations.\n\nLively explains: \u201cWith full knowledge that these are bald-faced lies, SMUG asserts that 1) I masterminded the 2009 Anti-Homosexuality Bill in Uganda, which they call the \u2018Kill the Gays Bill\u2019 [in fact, Lively publicly opposed the bill, which has since been struck down by Ugandan courts], 2) inflamed passions against homosexuals in Uganda by characterizing all homosexuals as irredeemable genocidal child molesters, and 3) introduced to Uganda the heretofore unknown strategy of criminalizing public promotion of homosexuality as a means of opposing the rise of a homosexual movement in Uganda. The proof that these are lies is found in the very same documents they misuse against me.\u201d\n\nCCR and SMUG also tried to blame Lively for the murder of Ugandan homosexual David Kato, a murder he also publicly condemned, making it the centerpiece of their lawsuit until, and as was noted in Liberty Counsel\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, it was revealed that, as Lively predicted, Kato was actually murdered by his \u201cgay\u201d lover who confessed to the crime, was convicted and is now in prison.\n\nBut all of this is incidental. It\u2019s a smokescreen. Keep in mind; we\u2019re talking about protected speech here. Lively is being tried for \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d for merely uttering, publicly, millennia-old biblical orthodoxy relative to sexual morality.\n\nSo how could such an Orwellian lawsuit \u2013 clearly designed as a weapon to both harass and intimidate Lively and anyone else who might dare challenge the global homosexual activist political agenda \u2013 even make its way into a U. S. federal court?\n\nWell, CCR and SMUG\u2019s angle was to circumvent that pesky ol\u2019 First Amendment, as well as Ugandan free-speech laws, through a gross misapplication of the Alien Tort Statute. Normally, this would have been laughed out of court and, in fact, just last year, even as this case was ongoing, the U.S. Supreme Court unequivocally ruled this very tactic to be unlawful.\n\nBut there\u2019s nothing normal about this case.\n\nMeet federal Judge Michael Ponsor. Ponsor, who thumbed his nose at the Supreme Court and denied Liberty Counsel\u2019s slam dunk Motion to Dismiss, is the textbook example of a judicial activist. He has admitted as much, once saying in another context that, \u201cAt some point I realized that judges are the unappointed legislators of mankind, and what we do is just as creative.\u201d\n\nBut for this judicial activist, the case would seem personal. At his inauguration to the federal bench he crowed, for instance, \u201cWe have a proud, vibrant gay and lesbian community.\u201d Presumably he knows this because one of his ex-wives reportedly later \u201cmarried\u201d another woman, while his daughter once revealed publicly on social media that she, too, was a lesbian.\n\nAnd so, to keep afloat the demonization of Scott Lively (of all Christians, really) despite the Supreme Court\u2019s torpedo, and to keep alive this judicial abuse, harassment and intimidation \u2013 Ponsor, as promised, got \u201ccreative.\u201d\n\nStill, the case will eventually be tossed. It\u2019s inevitable. But in the meantime, and as Harry Mihet, Pastor Lively\u2019s lead attorney, points out, \u201cBecause the Court denied Mr. Lively\u2019s Motion to Dismiss, we are now forced to go through many months and years of expensive and protracted discovery on two continents. Literally thousands of pages of documents are changing hands, and dozens of depositions will be taken. This makes the subpoenas to Houston pastors look like small potatoes.\u201d\n\n\u201cSMUG\u2019s and CCR\u2019s end game is clear: Make war criminals out of anyone who encourages any legislative body to pass any legislation upholding the traditional family. If Scott Lively is guilty of the Crime Against Humanity of Persecution, then so are the Houston pastors and anyone who has ever tried to influence legislation against the homosexual juggernaut. There is no limiting principle,\u201d concluded Mihet.\n\nYet, either way, for these anti-Christian extremists, the damage is done. The process is the punishment.\n\nThis was never about winning or losing.\n\nIt was always about intimidation.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A servant is not greater than his master..05/25/2016 17:47:57PM EST.", "author": "Matt Barber", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "A servant is not greater than his master.", "title": "- The Crucifixion of Pastor Scott Lively", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/mattbarber/2014/11/17/the-crucifixion-of-pastor-scott-lively-n1919143", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/264/4c21a1c3-4afc-4f61-8bf4-9d93b84d2b8f.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "A servant is not greater than his master.", "title": "- The Crucifixion of Pastor Scott Lively", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/mattbarber/2014/11/17/the-crucifixion-of-pastor-scott-lively-n1919143", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/264/4c21a1c3-4afc-4f61-8bf4-9d93b84d2b8f.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Crucifixion of Pastor Scott Lively, Matt Barber, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddef3\"", "article_summary": "As did Christ, Scott Lively speaks absolute truth, in absolute love, with absolutely no fear of personal destruction or even death.\n\u201cA servant is not greater than his master.\u201dI don\u2019t presume to compare my friend Scott Lively of Abiding Truth Ministries to Jesus Christ.\nAnd so Scott Lively prays for them.\nLively loves those who seek to defend him just as he loves those who seek to destroy him \u2013 and, make no mistake about it, precisely because Pastor Scott Lively has chosen to both obey and emulate Jesus Christ, there are people, very powerful people, who seek to destroy him.\nThat said, Pastor Lively is one of the most \u201cChrist-like\u201d people I\u2019ve had the honor to know."}
