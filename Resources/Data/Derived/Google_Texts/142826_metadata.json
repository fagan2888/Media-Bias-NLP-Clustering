Many dressed in white. (Photo: Unheard Voices Magazine )\n\nFamily and friends this week remembered the lives of murder victims Joan Colbert and her foster daughter, Veronica Roach, 10, during a service at the Second Baptist Church.\n\nColbert and Roach were found dead in their Lippincott Avenue home Aug. 1.\n\nOn Thursday, the Monmouth County Prosecutor\u2019s Office announced that Colbert\u2019s cousin, Brian Farmer, had been arrested and charged with their murders. He said the murders happened during a confrontation in which Colbert found Farmer taking pornographic pictures of the girl.\n\nThe Going Home Service, which celebrated the life stories of Colbert and Roach, was held Tuesday morning at the church. Their two caskets were placed at the front of the congregation, each with a simple spray of pink and purple flowers on top.\n\nColbert was known in the neighborhood as a friendly and cheerful person who cared for neighborhood children. She had raised Roach since she was an infant.\n\nJasmine Roach said she gave birth to Veronica at age 17 and turned to Colbert to raise the child.\n\n\u201cI was young at the time,\u201d Roach said. \u201cI needed help.\u201d\n\nRoach already had given birth to another daughter at age 16. The mother of five said Veronica and Colbert frequently visited Roach\u2019s other children and extended family.\n\nVeronica\u2019s grandfather, Albert Williams, said Colbert was \u201clike the Mother Teresa of the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nRoach was the daughter of Charley Bracey and Jasmine Roach. She attended Long Branch Public School and loved to play, dance and most of all be around her friends and family, according to her obituary.\n\nRoach is survived by her parents; three sisters, Makyia, Egypt and Azzura; two brothers, Ernton and Ahmine, and many aunts, uncles and cousins, according to the obituary.\n\nColbert was the daughter of the late Milton, Sr. and Mildred Colbert. Joan attended the Long Branch Public School and graduated in 1970. She worked and loved everyone who came in contact with her and was an active member in the community, according to her obituary.\n\nColbert is survived by one daughter, Markeya Butcher, three grandsons, Andre, Jaylen and Brandyn Jackson; her brothers and sisters, Irving, Milton, Ernie, George, John, Freddy, Jean, Evelyn, Betty Ann, Marilyn and Lorraine and many nieces, nephews and cousins.\n\nThe deaths are the second double homicide in Long Branch in a little more than a year. A couple was stabbed to death on Sairs Avenue on March 25, 2013. That crime remains unsolved.\n\nStephanie Loder: 732-456-2159\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1ow3wAy", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Joan Colbert and Veronica Roach were found dead in their Lippincott Avenue home Aug. 1.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "Joan Colbert and Veronica Roach were found dead in their Lippincott Avenue home Aug. 1.", "title": "Long Branch murder victims recalled at services", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/crime/jersey-mayhem/2014/08/13/long-branch-murder-victims-recalled-services/14039979/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Joan Colbert and Veronica Roach were found dead in their Lippincott Avenue home Aug. 1.", "title": "Long Branch murder victims recalled at services", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dab110de8f479ee44c40dfe25f326b42ecc2566c/c=408-0-2856-2448&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/AsburyPark/2014/08/15/veronicaroachcasket.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": ""}, "article_summary": "The deaths are the second double homicide in Long Branch in a little more than a year.\nJoan attended the Long Branch Public School and graduated in 1970.\nVeronica Roach\u2019s casket is brought down the steps after the service in Long Branch.\nShe attended Long Branch Public School and loved to play, dance and most of all be around her friends and family, according to her obituary.\n(Photo: Unheard Voices Magazine )Family and friends this week remembered the lives of murder victims Joan Colbert and her foster daughter, Veronica Roach, 10, during a service at the Second Baptist Church."}
