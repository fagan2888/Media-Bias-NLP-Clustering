Summum (2008) in which the Court ruled that the Summum religious group cannot not force Pleasant Grove City to accept and display a monument bearing the \u201cSeven Summum Principles\u201d of creation. It was determined that choosing which monuments the city wants displayed falls under the city\u2019s right to government free speech, and that the city has a right to refuse donations for other projects.\n\nIn opposition, the Sons of Confederate Veterans utilized the same case, arguing that the \u201creasonable observer\u201d test created by Justice David Souter categorized specialty plates as private speech. The test asks \u201cwhether a reasonable and fully informed observer would understand the expression to be government speech, as distinct from private speech.\u201d\n\nHere, it was argued that the Texas Board had engaged in impermissible viewpoint discrimination. As evidence, the plaintiffs pointed to the state\u2019s prior approval of specialty plates commemorating past wars.\n\n\u201cViewpoint\u201d discrimination can be distinguished from \u201ccontent-based\u201d discrimination, which holds that it may be permissible to restrict private speech in situations when entire categories, not particular viewpoints, are withheld from discussion.\n\nSince Texas had not deemed all flag-bearing or war-commemorating plates impermissible, the Fifth Circuit ruled that the Board engaged in viewpoint discrimination by singling out the Sons of Confederate Veterans\u2019 request for rejection.\n\nThe case falls on the heels of a request by North Carolina for the Supreme Court to hear a case dealing with the state\u2019s right to issue plates bearing the text, \u201cChoose Life.\u201d The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit previously ruled that, because specialty plates represent private speech, North Carolina had engaged in viewpoint discrimination when it refused a later request to issue pro-choice specialty plates.\n\nHowever, North Carolina may be able to successfully argue that it engaged instead in permissible content-based discrimination. A 2008 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit suggests that the phrase \u201cChoose Life\u201d could, in fact, represent both sides of the argument, arguing not for or against policy decisions the way \u201cPro-Life\u201d and \u201cPro-Choice\u201d explicitly do, but instead asking only that pregnant mothers choose not to have an abortion.\n\n\u201cA \u2018Choose Life\u2019 plate,\u201d Judge Diane Sykes writes, \u201cdoes not speak to whether abortion should be legal, but instead recognizes that under our legal system only pregnant women can choose whether or not to have an abortion. The message simply recommends that a woman contemplating abortion choose life for her unborn child.\u201d\n\nYet North Carolina appears to favor another route, arguing instead that specialty plates are not government speech. \u201cAs the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed as recently as 2009,\u201d Alliance Defending Freedom senior counsel David Cortman argues, \u201cthe government \u2018has the right to speak for itself\u2026and to select the views it wants to express.\u2019\u201d\n\nIndeed, past cases have treaded close to the issue. For example, in Wooley v. Maynard (1977), the Supreme Court ruled that New Hampshire could not force moral objectors to display the state motto \u201cLive Free or Die\u201d on state-issued license plates.\n\nShould the Supreme Court rule specialty plates to be government speech, it would mean a reversal of decisions by the Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits that hold such plates to be private speech. Even if the lower courts are affirmed, the high court could still hand North Carolina a victory should \u201cChoose Life\u201d be ruled viewpoint-neutral.\n\nMatt George is an intern at the National Constitution Center.\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nBeard length case first up for Supreme Court in October\n\nIndia commission rules for two women jailed for Facebook use\n\nMeet the next possible big court challenge to Obamacare\n\nPodcast: Experts debate partisanship and the Roberts court\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held this week that the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles Board violated the free speech provision of the First Amendment when it refused to approve...", "title": "Appeals court says Texas DMV violated First Amendment", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2014/07/appeals-court-says-texas-dmv-violated-first-amendment/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Texas_License_Plate.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Texas_License_Plate.jpg?w=240", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-19T10:00:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-28T14:56:17+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/matt-george/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce92d\"", "article_summary": "As evidence, the plaintiffs pointed to the state\u2019s prior approval of specialty plates commemorating past wars.\nv.
