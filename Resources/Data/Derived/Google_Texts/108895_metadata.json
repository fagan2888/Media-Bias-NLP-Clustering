Burwell is centered around subsidies; specifically, it challenges tax subsidies given to people who purchase health insurance on the federal government\u2019s marketplace.\n\nThirty-seven states don\u2019t have state exchanges. Instead, citizens of those states who receive subsidies get them on the federal marketplace. This is at odds at how the law is written, and that is what is being challenged in King v. Burwell. The law states that subsidies are available \u201cthrough an exchange established by the state.\u201d Since a majority of states do not have exchanges, this has presented a challenge. A King victory would eliminate subsidies for 7 million people in those states without exchanges.\n\nOhio does not have a state-run exchange. Ohioans requiring a subsidy rely on the federal exchange. The possible implications of a ruling striking down these subsidies are creating concern for Ohio politicians.\n\nDemocratic state Reps. Michael Stinziano and Nickie Antonio are planning legislation to create a state run exchange in Ohio in an attempt to resolve this issue.\n\n\u201cIf we wait for the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, we\u2019re going to find ourselves at a disadvantage,\u201d Stinziano said, the Dispatch reported. He said that losing subsidies would increase insurance premiums by 35 percent, forcing some Ohioans to drop health care coverage and thus raising insurance rates even more. \u201cNow that we have so many Ohioans enrolled [in federal health care plans], this has a significant impact on their care and what direction we\u2019re going as a state,\u201d Stinziano told the Washington Post.\n\nBoth branches of the Ohio Legislature are dominated by Republicans, so it would be unlikely to envision this legislation being easily passed. However, Gov. John Kasich has not completely shelved the idea.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to get ahead of ourselves on what the Supreme Court might do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if it threw a half a million people without insurance, we\u2019d have to look at it.\u201d\n\nObamacare is deeply unpopular in Ohio. In 2011, Ohioans approved the Healthcare Freedom Amendment by a whopping 65 percent. This called for exempting Ohioans from national healthcare mandates.\n\nIf Kasich were to push for a state exchange, he would find himself at odds with most Ohioans who object to Obamacare. As Kasich considers a possible run for the White House, he will certainly be weighing the effects of a state run exchange on his political prospects.\n\nKasich already has felt the heat from conservatives as a result of Medicaid expansion. When the Ohio House of Representatives refused to go along with expanding Medicaid, Kasich jammed it through the Ohio Controlling Board after the Speaker of the House and Senate President removed members of the board who opposed it and replaced them with those who approved. In its first year, Kasich\u2019s Medicaid expansion was substantially over budget, raising concerns with Ohio legislators.\n\nFormer Ohio Majority Whip and current candidate for State Senate, John Adams, has been critical of Obamacare and Ohio\u2019s Medicaid expansion. His concerns highlight those of many conservative Ohioans.\n\n\u201cAs with those states that took the Medicaid Expansion \u201cfree money\u201d bribe, the ACA bribe continued in the form of tax credits. The federalism argument vs the larger statutory context is what is at play. We have been let down before but I\u2019ll remain optimistic.\u201d\n\nObamacare has had serious effects on Ohioans. Premiums have risen dramatically, and the policies were crafted with lobbyists and politicians in mind, as opposed to permitting consumers to determine what is best for them. While politicians promised lower premiums and better access to services, the reversed has happened.\n\nMany Americans, Ohioans included, have had their previous policies cancelled. They now face skyrocketing policies monthly with deductibles so high they don\u2019t meet their needs.\n\nThe impact of this law is still being demonstrated to average citizens facing the daunting prospects of unaffordable insurance and high deductibles.\n\nThis article was written by a contributor of Watchdog Arena, Franklin Center\u2019s network of writers, bloggers, and citizen journalists.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Ohio Gov.
