That\u2019s not me. I guess it\u2019s one of those things where you just turn the page and look forward to your next outing. Our guys kept battling \u2026 and they almost came back and picked me up.\u201d\n\nFor the record, Lyles walked only six \u2014 still a career high \u2014 but it sure seemed like more. He needed 92 pitches (46 strikes) to get through 3 innings. It marked just the third time in his career he failed to make it to the fourth inning.\n\nBut led by National League batting leader Troy Tulowitzki, the Rockies rallied to make things promising. That is, until San Diego pinch-hitter Carlos Quentin rocked reliever Chris Martin with a two-run homer in the seventh inning to extend the Padres\u2019 lead to 8-5.\n\nPHOTOS: Colorado Rockies 5, San Diego Padres 8, May 17, 2014\n\nLyles was touted as the groundball specialist, but it was Padres starter Robbie Erlin who wriggled out of major trouble by inducing four double-play grounders in his 5 innings. All told, the Rockies grounded into five double plays, matching the club record set vs. Atlanta on April 18, 1997, and at San Francisco on Sept. 4, 2002.\n\n\u201cWe got down early, made a move and got in a position to win that game,\u201d manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cIt was a tough game, but we fought back.\u201d\n\nLyles\u2019 stock was sky high coming into the night: a 5-0 record, 2.66 ERA and impeccable control. Even the San Diego TV crew interviewed Weiss about Lyles before the game. Lyles then crashed like it was October 1929.\n\nLyles\u2019 control was absent from the first inning on and he ended up getting pounded for six runs on five hits. His three walks in San Diego\u2019s first inning were punctuated by Yonder Alonso\u2019s two-run double.\n\nWas it simply a matter of Lyles not having command of his pitches?\n\n\u201cNothing more than he just struggled to throw strikes,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cHe has been really good, but he just struggled tonight. He\u2019s been pretty much lights out. He\u2019s been very good, but he didn\u2019t have it tonight.\u201d\n\nAs a staff, Rockies pitchers issued a season-high nine walks.\n\n\u201cI just threw too many balls, and gave up too many walks,\u201d Lyles said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be successful doing that here, or anywhere.\u201d\n\nLyles served up a loud two-run homer to center to former Rockies outfielder Seth Smith in the second inning. His wild pitch to Chris Denorfia in the third inning was so wild, it nearly hit the backstop on the fly.\n\nThe Rockies have now lost six of their past eight games, but Tulo just keeps raking. He went 3-for-4 and raised his batting average to .400. He\u2019s hit safely in 16 of his 17 games at Coors Field this season, a place where he\u2019s hitting .603 with seven homers, seven doubles and 23 RBIs.\n\nTulowitzki hit a solo shot to deep left field in the first inning, his 12th homer of the season. He singled in the fourth to advance Drew Stubbs to third base. Stubbs then scored on Carlos Gonzalez\u2019s sacrifice fly.\n\nIn the sixth, Stubbs and Tulo singled in front of CarGo, setting the table for CarGo\u2019s two-run double that soared over center fielder Will Venable. That cut the Padres\u2019 lead to 6-5.\n\nTulo came close to hero time in the seventh. With two on, he screeched a two-out line drive \u2014 only to see it find the glove of diving third baseman Chase Headley. Tulo tossed his bat and helmet, a symbol of the Rockies\u2019 frustration Saturday.\n\n\u201cIt feels good for me, but it\u2019s tough to lose,\u201d said CarGo, who went 2-for-3 and showed signs of breaking out of his lingering slump. \u201cLyles didn\u2019t have his best stuff tonight, so it was tough. We weren\u2019t ready for that. I think about the way he\u2019s been piching the whole year, so everytime he\u2019s on the mound, we kind of expect better than that.\n\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t blame him, bad games happen. He\u2019s been really good since he got the call. It\u2019s a tough loss, but we just have to show up tomorrow and win the game.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Rockies lose at home to San Diego Padres as Jordan Lyles struggles", "title": "Rockies lose at home to San Diego Padres as Jordan Lyles struggles", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/17/rockies-lose-at-home-to-san-diego-padres-as-jordan-lyles-struggles/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140517__rox-slidep1.jpg", "height": 525}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140517__rox-slidep1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-17T21:56:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T14:36:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "A terrible start by heretofore reliable starter Jordan Lyles put the Rockies in a 6-1 hole after three innings.\n\u201cIt was a tough game, but we fought back.\u201dLyles\u2019 stock was sky high coming into the night: a 5-0 record, 2.66 ERA and impeccable control.\nEven the San Diego TV crew interviewed Weiss about Lyles before the game.\nThat is, until San Diego pinch-hitter Carlos Quentin rocked reliever Chris Martin with a two-run homer in the seventh inning to extend the Padres\u2019 lead to 8-5.\nHe\u2019s been very good, but he didn\u2019t have it tonight.\u201dAs a staff, Rockies pitchers issued a season-high nine walks."}
