Well, actually, it is, we looked it up! The shutdown was the worst, but this thing is worser.\n\nIf we thought the partisan blather couldn't get thicker or sillier than it got during the shutdown, well, we now know.\n\nBy now we have heard from all the people whose fault it wasn't. We're heard all the talking points. And some of the critics were all but foaming at the mouth.\n\nIt was the Washington we have come to know -- all talk all the time, but at the end of the day, just another example of how government seems incapable of making things better . . . and it never seems to learn.\n\nDoes anyone believe that successful start-ups like Amazon or Google would have risked launching their programs before they were properly tested?\n\nThere may be a lesson there, if those involved could spend less time refining the talking points and more time actually trying to make things work.\n\nThe way this thing is going, it is a good thing we have a word like worser.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Bob Schieffer: Just when you thought things couldn&#039;t get worse, along comes the disastrous roll-out of the Obamacare website", "og": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/washington-today-worse-and-worser/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/10/18/003bc936-4783-11e3-a5af-047d7b15b92e/thumbnail/1200x630/3b18b74897eda3a03ea57f3bd17f6498/CTM_1018_HEALTHCARE_1.jpg", "height": 630}, "type": "article", "description": "Bob Schieffer: Just when you thought things couldn't get worse, along comes the disastrous roll-out of the Obamacare website", "title": "Washington today: Worse and worser"}, "twitter": {"description": "Bob Schieffer: Just when you thought things couldn't get worse, along comes the disastrous roll-out of the Obamacare website", "title": "Washington today: Worse and worser", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "cbsnewsapp://news/washington-today-worse-and-worser/", "iphone": "cbsnewsapp://news/washington-today-worse-and-worser/", "googleplay": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/washington-today-worse-and-worser/"}, "country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "CBS News", "iphone": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"ipad": 334256223, "iphone": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}}, "creator": "@https://twitter.com/bobschieffer", "site": "@facethenation", "image": "http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/10/18/003bc936-4783-11e3-a5af-047d7b15b92e/thumbnail/1200x630/3b18b74897eda3a03ea57f3bd17f6498/CTM_1018_HEALTHCARE_1.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"web": {"url": "http://www.cbsnews.com/news/washington-today-worse-and-worser/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "ios": {"url": "cbsnewsapp://news/washington-today-worse-and-worser/", "app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223}}, "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FaceTheNation"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdb5d\"", "article_summary": "The way this thing is going, it is a good thing we have a word like worser.\nThe shutdown was the worst, but this thing is worser.\nWe're heard all the talking points.\nThere may be a lesson there, if those involved could spend less time refining the talking points and more time actually trying to make things work.\nIf we thought the partisan blather couldn't get thicker or sillier than it got during the shutdown, well, we now know."}
