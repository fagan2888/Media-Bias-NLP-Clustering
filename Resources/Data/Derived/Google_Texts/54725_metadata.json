As a college and career academy, pathways not offered elsewhere in the county will be designed as a college major-type format, with students taking classes with the same peers who are interested in their own pathway.\n\nEach of Forsyth County\u2019s five public high schools has career pathways available to students that are not replicated between campuses.\n\nSome of the pathways being considered for the new school include aeronautics, graphic design, energy systems, health care science and mechatronics.\n\nA goal of the academy is to focus on high-demand, high-growth, high-wage careers, join with local universities and businesses and offer training and certification in a dual-enrollment-style system.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.forsythnews.com/archives/29677/", "image": "http://media.morristechnology.com/webmedia/upload/forsythnews/article/2016/03/18/design2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "CUMMING \u2014 A new college and career academy, which will be the fourth public school to open in Forsyth County in half as many years, now has a place to call home.", "title": "Site purchased for new high school in Cumming"}, "robots": "noarchive", "title": "Site purchased for new high school in Cumming"}, "article_summary": "The Alliance Academy will be run under the terms of the school system\u2019s Strategic Waivers School System contact with the state.\n\u201cThis is a good place \u2026 we picked the site,\u201d said Superintendent Jeff Bearden of the deal between the school system and the city.\nThe property will become the site of the Alliance Academy for Innovation of Cumming-Forsyth County, an alternative public high school.\nThe Forsyth County Board of Education on Thursday approved a $3.1 million contract to buy 23 acres from the city of Cumming.\nEach of Forsyth County\u2019s five public high schools has career pathways available to students that are not replicated between campuses."}
