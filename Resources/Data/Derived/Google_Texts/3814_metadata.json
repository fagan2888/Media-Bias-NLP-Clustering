Not surprisingly, Nevada and New Jersey casinos generated more than 40 percent of the 27,000 Suspicious Activity Reports filed in 2013.\n\nCasinos are similar to banks in some areas when it comes to filing reports and tracking cash transactions. \u201cCasinos and card clubs subject to the (Bank Secrecy Act) BSA are required to develop, implement, and maintain an (Anti-Money Laundering) AML program; file casino (Currency Transaction Reports) CTRs and SARs; and maintain certain transaction records,\u201d the report says. \u201cCasinos do not have a distinct customer identification program obligation.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s likely in the process of changing as the treasury department and its Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) continue to battle money laundering to fight everything from drug trafficking to terrorism financing. Casino reporting has evolved substantially in recent years. Most gaming properties are obliged to established procedures to collect customer identification, \u201cfor record keeping and reporting purposes and to use the casino\u2019s computer system to aid in assuring compliance,\u201d the report states, echoing the remarks of FinCEN Executive Director Jennifer Shasky Calvery at the 2014 Bank Secrecy Act Conference in Las Vegas. \u201cThese systems are also expected to be used in identifying transactions or patterns of transactions required to be reported as suspicious, including in relation to a customer\u2019s source of funds.\u201d\n\nSome of the names in the report will sound familiar.\n\nA bookmaking scandal at the M Resorts generated more than two dozen defendants and took down the casino\u2019s sports book boss Mike Colbert. The insider job provided a text book example of why the regulatory apparatus exists.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the Department of Justice\u2019s positively mortifying money laundering investigation against Las Vegas Sands in connection with the criminal activities of former customer Sinaloa drug cartel associate Zhenli Ye Gon. In 2013, the Treasury Department agreed to conclude a criminal investigation after Sands agreed to pay to the United States $47.4 million, the sum sent to The Venetian casino by Zhenli Ye Gon from Mexico.\n\nWhich raises the issue of the international flow of illicit funds to Las Vegas gaming resorts and those casinos operated by Nevada licensees. This is one to watch.\n\n\u201cAs U.S. casino companies expand internationally, with foreign marketing branches and sister properties, there is the potential for a person to establish a casino account in one country and access the funds through an affiliated casino in another country,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe most significant money laundering vulnerability at U.S. casinos is the potential for individuals to access foreign funds of questionable origin through U.S. casinos, and to use the money for gambling and other personal or entertainment expenses, and then withdraw or transfer the remaining funds either in the United States or elsewhere.\u201d\n\nRemember those words in the coming months. I have a strong feeling we\u2019re going to be hearing a lot more about the flow of big money from foreign jurisdictions into the U.S. via some highly questionable casino transfers.\n\nWho knows, maybe those transfers will make next year\u2019s NMLRA yearbook.\n\nJohn L.
