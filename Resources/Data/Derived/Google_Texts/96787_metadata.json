REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\n4499340\n\nWashington state\u2019s Obamacare exchange has fallen short of its signup goal by more than 50,000.\n\nFox News reports that the state has only enrolled 160,000 paying customers to the exchange. This has led to an extension of the enrollment deadline, and prompted a request to the state legislature for $125 million in funding.\n\nWhen the exchange was established, it was projected that it would become self-sufficient by year\u2019s end.\n\nEven Democrats who supported the Obamacare law are beginning to show signs of frustration with the lack of progress. Most of the money requested by the exchange would go to advertising, not to health care or rising operating costs.\n\nDemocratic state Rep. Ross Hunter reacted to the advertising plans with skepticism.\n\n\u201cI want to see what their outreach is,\u201d said Hunter. \u201cI don\u2019t want a one-liner, because we\u2019re going to make judgments about what is the effective amount of advertising.\u201d\n\nThus far, only 14 states have opted to run their own exchanges and each one is struggling without federal tax dollars.\n\nNew York is proposing a $69 million tax on non-exchange insurance policies, while Vermont is projected to have a shortfall of $20 million by the end of the year. Rhode Island is another state with it\u2019s own exchange. However, they recently filed a bill that would dissolve the state exchange in favor of a federal one. This move would avoid a $24 million price tag for the taxpayers.\n\nWashington state officials have admitted that they have been doing a lot of guess work with regard to costs.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t really have a good sense about what we were projecting in terms of costs,\u201d exchange CEO Richard Onizuka said. \u201cWe now know more about what it\u2019s going to take to serve 1.7 million customers that come through the system.\u201d\n\nMany of the exchanges are faced with the similar problem of young people opting out. Instead of making insurance payments, they are choosing to pay a fine. So long as young healthy people avoid the exchanges, taxpayers will be stuck with the bill.\n\nDr. Roger Stark of the Washington Medical center says that, \u201cIf the product was that great to begin with, people would learn about it. They would know about it, they would understand it, and that\u2019s exactly what has not happened with our state exchange.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme court heard arguments earlier this month in the case of King v. Burwell. If the justices rule in favor of the plaintiffs, the 34 states who rely on the federal government could have their exchanges shut down. Leaving only 14 struggling state run exchanges to pick up the pieces. A decision on the health care subsidies is expected this summer.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Nick Givas", "description": "Requesting $125 million extra from state legislature", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Washington state's Obamacare exchange has fallen short of its signup goal by more than 50,000.
