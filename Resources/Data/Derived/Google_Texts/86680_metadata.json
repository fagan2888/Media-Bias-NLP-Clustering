We suspect this is due to the fact that some governors, especially in the South where 55% of the Black population lives, have fought against Medicaid expansion and other quality health care opportunities provided by the Affordable Care Act for partisan reasons. \u201d\n\nRecently, Essence Magazine\u2018s Editor-in-Chief Vanessa De Luca; Melanie Campbell, Convener of the Black Women\u2019s Roundtable and president/CEO, National Coalition on Black Civic Participation; and Lauren Victoria Burke, Managing Editor of Politic365.com, spoke with Roland Martin about the influence Black women voters have and the issues that are most important to them.\n\nCampbell told Martin that not only are Black women one of the most powerful voting blocks in America, they are influencers as well.\n\n\u201cWe get the men to vote, we get our children to vote, we get our nieces and nephews to vote, and so what we know is that Black women are motivated by our issues being addressed.\u201d\n\nThe polling data compiled from the survey revealed the most important Power of the Sister issues as follows:\n\nAffordable healthcare \u2013 49%\n\nLiving Wage jobs \u2013 43%\n\nCollege Affordability \u2013 38%\n\nQuality Public Education \u2013 38%\n\nCriminal Justice Reform \u2013 37%\n\nOne issue that all Black women seem to agree upon is their dislike of the Republican Party. NewsOne Now panelist Lauren Victoria Burke explained their \u201chate\u201d of the GOP is a result of Black women\u2019s issues not being addressed.\n\nWatch Roland Martin, Vanessa De Luca, Melanie Campbell, and Lauren Victoria Burke discuss The Power of the Sister Vote Poll in the video clip above.\n\nTV One\u2019s NewsOne Now has moved to 7 A.M.
