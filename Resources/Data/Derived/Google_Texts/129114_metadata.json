But uninsured artists reading Schachter\u2019s piece need not despair entirely. Some might instead consider moving to Oregon, where Obamacare has already proven to be a boon for the arts.\n\nDespite facing a $16.2 million shortfall this year due to an accounting error, the state\u2019s insurance exchange, Cover Oregon, has budgeted about $20 million (mostly in federal tax dollars) for outreach efforts, which so far have included commissioning a series of music videos promoting the exchange.\n\nPerhaps out of a noble desire to preserve participating musicians\u2019 artistic integrity, the state appears to have imposed few if any content requirements on the artists writing songs for the promotional videos. Despite the enormous expense to taxpayers represented by the ad campaign, it's cleqr some of the costly advertisements have nothing at all to do with Oregon\u2019s Obamacare exchange.\n\nThe hip-hop group Lifesavas, for example, used taxpayer dollars to make a music video about a fun house party.\n\nAccording to Vursatyl, one of the members of Lifesavas, the only instructions given to the group were to emulate Schoolhouse Rock and \u201cnot to get too political. Keep everyone in mind.\u201d That lack of guidance shows. The song\u2019s message that \u201cLife is a jewel, a gem, a treasure\u201d is unobjectionable, but it also has nothing to do with Obamacare. And aside from one vague mention of \u201cthe care you deserve\u201d and a brief flash of Cover Oregon\u2019s logo, the ad makes absolutely no reference to the state exchange. Nonetheless, Mark Ray, co-owner of an ad agency paid $9.9 million for the music video campaign, seems inclined to think the ad was effective at getting its point\u2014whatever that was supposed to be\u2014across.\n\n\u201cWe were blown away by how good the track was \u2026 and how much thought they put into the lyrics and song,\u201d Ray told local press upon the ad\u2019s release.\n\nTaxpayer-funded music videos by folk artists Dave Depper and Laura Gibson have barely been more pertinent, and Oregonians have started to notice. One resident recently complained to a local paper, \u201cThey look more like tourism ads for the state. For all the viewer can see, Cover Oregon could be a house paint. A folk singer playing his guitar in the middle of a creek does not tell anything about health insurance changes under [Obamacare].\u201d\n\nOregonians concerned that the ad campaign is a waste of money should remember, however, that coverage expansion was but one of many of the goals of Obamacare\u2019s authors. In selling the bill in 2010, Nancy Pelosi explained, \u201cWe see it as an entrepreneurial bill\u2014a bill that says to someone, if you want to be creative and be a musician or whatever, you can leave your work, focus on your talent, your skill, your passion, your aspirations. \u2026\u201d Given all the failed promises of Obamacare, there is something admirable about Cover Oregon\u2019s attempts to make good on this one by financing the work of the state\u2019s musicians.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Obamacare,Oregon,Jacob Reses", "og": {"site_name": "Weekly Standard", "description": "As Ben Schachter&nbsp;explained&nbsp;earlier this month in THE WEEKLY STANDARD, the implementation of Obamacare has been especially hard on creative professionals, whose trade associations have been forced to eliminate various cost-effective insurance offerings due to the law\u2019s mandates.
