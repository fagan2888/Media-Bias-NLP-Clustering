Chen\u2019s company Adlens designed the spectacles \u2014 which cost less than two U.S. dollars \u2014 using a design from late Nobel Prize-winning scientist Luis Alvarez.\n\nUnited Kingdom publication The Sunday Times reported that the project, financed by the U.K.\u2019s Department for International Development, will likely expand to African countries Botswana and Namibia, and Bhutan in Asia.\n\nAccording to volunteer eye health and safety organization Prevent Blindness, key causes of vision loss include age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. During a time when vision loss \u2014 partial or whole \u2014 affects nearly 517 million people worldwide, government officials have touted the project as a step forward in addressing an increasingly common public health issue.\n\n\u201cThese affordable, self-adjustable gasses are a real game changer,\u201d Justine Greening, U.K.\u2019s International Development Secretary, told The Independent. \u201cBritish ingenuity like this can transform the lives of millions of visually impaired people across the developing world. I\u2019m proud that British inventors are responsible for breakthroughs that continue to improve the world around us.\u201d\n\nWhile eyeglasses can serve as an aid for the visually impaired, many low-income people don\u2019t have access to corrective vision tools, due in part to its high costs. Plus, in the developing world, there are so few eye care specialists that it\u2019s hard for poor people to find someone to conduct even the simplest exam. That\u2019s why the World Health Organization\u2019s latest action plan called for a focus on \u201cuniversal eye health,\u201d setting a target of reducing avoidable vision impairment by 25 percent in the next five years.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t just an issue for developing nations. Here in the United States, the adults at high risk of vision loss tend to use eye care services much less than their insured and affluent counterparts. And the prevalence of poor eyesight among Americans is expected to triple within the next couple decades.\n\nNonetheless, even with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, some Americans will not get the eye health care coverage they need. While health plans in exchanges must provide eye exams and glasses for children, adults won\u2019t be able to secure a pair spectacles or contacts. Rules that forbid the purchase of individual policies with federal tax credits further complicates things for many of the visually impaired.\n\nThe lack of access to affordable glasses poses severe health consequences for the visually impaired, especially those in lower income brackets \u2014 a reality that some experts say undermines the Affordable Care Act\u2019s goal of providing preventative health care.\n\nMany studies, for example, have tied vision impairment to the prevalence of chronic health conditions, falls and injuries, depression, and social isolation. In Americans older than 65, loss of eyesight reduces one\u2019s ability to lead a normal life and take part in everyday activities \u2014 including reading, writing, driving, and watching television. It can also mean a shorter lifespan, according to a study conducted by researchers at Purdue University West Lafayette, Ind. Children with poor vision also stand a greater chance of not performing well in school and later entering the criminal justice system, according to data compiled by the National Parent-Teacher Association.\n\nThe health care industry also takes on the burden of poor eyesight \u2014 medical expenses for adults with vision impairment total more than $8 million annually.\n\nJust like Chen\u2019s efforts, some philanthropic organizations have stepped up to the plate to fill this void. Since 1932, New Jersey-based nonprofit Free Eyes has provided more than 8 million pairs of glasses to Americans and people across the world. Uninsured children can also get free eye exams through Sights for Students, a national Vison Service Provider that identifies the greatest need through its network of eye doctors who provide these services.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "One British company is trying to expand access to eye care in developing countries.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "One British company is trying to expand access to eye care in developing countries.", "title": "Why It Makes Sense To Give The World\u2019s Poorest People Glasses That Cost Just $2", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/11/03/3587932/visually-impaired-low-income/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP100428045163.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One British company is trying to expand access to eye care in developing countries.", "creator": "@SamPKCollins", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP100428045163-321x214.jpg", "title": "Why It Makes Sense To Give The World\u2019s Poorest People Glasses That Cost Just $2", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP100428045163.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AP100428045163.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-03T12:53:57+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/sampkcollinswriter"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccfee\"", "article_summary": "Nonetheless, even with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, some Americans will not get the eye health care coverage they need.\nRules that forbid the purchase of individual policies with federal tax credits further complicates things for many of the visually impaired.\nAccording to volunteer eye health and safety organization Prevent Blindness, key causes of vision loss include age-related macular degeneration, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma.\n\u201cBritish ingenuity like this can transform the lives of millions of visually impaired people across the developing world.\nHere in the United States, the adults at high risk of vision loss tend to use eye care services much less than their insured and affluent counterparts."}
