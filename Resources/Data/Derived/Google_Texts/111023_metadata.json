The replacement of the ICD-9 code sets, which many viewed as obsolete, with the more modern ICD-10 ultimately results in the availability of better healthcare data, which can be leveraged, many believe, to improve patient outcomes and patient safety, lower healthcare costs and move forward with population health.\n\nI had the opportunity to speak with Richard Averill, senior healthcare policy advisor for 3M and a member of the Coalition for ICD-10's governing board, about the long-term impact of the transition to ICD-10.\n\nAverill sees ICD-10 as a nothing less than a fundamental and necessary building block in the ongoing transformation of healthcare delivery.\n\nRichard Averill\n\n\u201cIf you think of all the things we\u2019re trying to do \u2013 the Affordable Care Act, various attempts at value-based purchasing, measuring quality, looking at readmissions and complications \u2013 to really get at the issue of what are fair and accurate payments and what kind of quality is being provided? Those are all very ambitious endeavors and it really requires a clear and precise understanding of what was wrong with the patient, their diagnosis, their complications, co morbidities and also what was done to the patient, how were they treated and what kind of procedures did they have?\u201d Averill says.\n\nHe points out that the ICD-9 coding set has been in use since 1979 and a \u201csystem of a bygone era.\u201d\n\n\u201cBack then, you could still smoke in the patients\u2019 rooms, there was no Internet, no personal computers,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s been so frustrating over the past four or five years, trying to be so ambitious in terms of what we\u2019re trying to do and the judgments we\u2019re trying to make and being constrained by an archaic diagnostic and procedure coding system.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, as we move forward with things like value-based purchasing and accessing quality, it\u2019s not only going to affect what institutions and individual providers are paid and perhaps ultimately their financial viability, but it\u2019s going to affect reputations of institutions and individuals,\u201d he says. \u201cSo in this new world that is rapidly emerging, the accuracy, detail and precision of ICD-10 is absolutely essential.\u201d\n\nAnd as many hospitals and health systems forge ahead into the population health world, the ability to effectively analyze patient care data will be crucial.\n\n\u201cEffective population health requires data that\u2019s precise and detailed enough to enable adequate risk adjustment so that you can then ask \u2018How well am I managing my patients and am I being paid fairly?\u2019\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cFrom the perspective of managing a population of patients, you also need precise, detailed data to measure quality and efficiency. ICD-10 gives you that level of detail that enables you to do that in a more fair and accurate way,\u201d Averill says.\n\nThe implementation of ICD-10 has a number of other advantages, such as greatly improved disease management, the ability to track the efficacy of new medical technologies and devices, which had not been possible with the simplistic, four-digit codes with ICD-9, as well as the ability to detect new and emerging health threats, like Ebola. \u201cThere was no code in ICD-9 for even tracking that,\u201d Averill says, referring to the Ebola virus and a possible outbreak in the U.S. like the one that hit West Africa in 2014.\n\nThe use of ICD-10 codes also will cut down on what he calls the \u201cgigantic paper chase\u201d for providers, as historically commercial payers have frequently asked for more information or additional details about a procedure when providers submit claims.\n\n\u201cOnce ICD-10 is truly functional, we will have a more administratively simple claims processing system in terms of the interaction between payers and providers because the information that the payer or auditor needs will be contained in the code,\u201d he says.\n\nSo, why, then, all the consternation and anxiety about the ICD-10 implementation?\n\n\u201cFor small physicians\u2019 offices that have had to deal with e-prescribing and the electronic medical record, it\u2019s a lot of change in a short period of time, and then ICD-10 coming on top of that,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople want to slow down the pace of change. Unfortunately, ICD-10 should have been the first building block or the first change that was made and then the other changes should have come later.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think a year from now, everyone will look back and say \u2018We have a more logistical, more efficient, more fair payment system and judgments on quality than we could have had under ICD-9 and people will look back on it in a positive way,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,assistedhousingfinancialinsider.com,assistedhousinginsider.com,commercialleaselawinsider.com,constructionsuperconference.com,efaconference.com,secure.rhq.com,secure2.rhq.com,www.addictionpro.com,www.apartmentlawinsider.com,www.assistedhousinginsider.com,www.behavioral.net,www.commercialleaselawinsider.com,www.commercialtenantsleaseinsider.com,www.communityassociationinsider.com,www.constructionsuperconference.com,www.entjournal.com,www.environmentsforaging.com,www.etouches.com,www.fairhousingcoach.com,www.hcd11.com,www.healthcare-informatics.com,www.healthcarebuildingideas.com,www.healthcaredesignmagazine.com,www.herdjournal.com,www.ihealthtran.com,www.landlordvtenant.com,www.ltlmagazine.com,www.nycapartmentlaw.com,www.taxcredithousinginsider.com,www.vendomegrp.com,www.vendomerealestatemedia.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "com.silverpop.cothost": "engage4.silverpop.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddc8f\"", "article_summary": "Six weeks have passed since the Oct. 1 ICD-10 transition and now that the dust has settled (and no patient care organization has collapsed, to my knowledge), it\u2019s time to talk about the bigger picture.\nAverill sees ICD-10 as a nothing less than a fundamental and necessary building block in the ongoing transformation of healthcare delivery.\nICD-10 gives you that level of detail that enables you to do that in a more fair and accurate way,\u201d Averill says.\nI had the opportunity to speak with Richard Averill, senior healthcare policy advisor for 3M and a member of the Coalition for ICD-10's governing board, about the long-term impact of the transition to ICD-10.\n\u201cFrom the perspective of managing a population of patients, you also need precise, detailed data to measure quality and efficiency."}
