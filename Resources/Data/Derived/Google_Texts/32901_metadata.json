But if by then the moderate opposition has been smacked and ISIL is still there, that doesn\u2019t help,\u201d a senior administration official told CNN.\n\nComplicating matters for the Obama administration is the fact that the vetting of Syrian opposition fighters still hasn\u2019t started \u2014 more than four months after the U.S.-led coalition\u2019s objective was announced.\n\n\u201cThe vetting hasn\u2019t started. Once it does start, that will be about a three- to five-month process and then it\u2019s about 8-9 months of training after that. So we still got a ways to go,\u201d Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby told CNN.\n\nNews of the changing strategy comes weeks after it was reported that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel sent a private memo to Susan Rice about serious reservations regarding Mr. Obama\u2019s Syria strategy.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senior U.S. officials and diplomats said Wednesday that President Obama is looking for a new strategy to deal with the Islamic State group and the regime of Bashar al Assad in Syria.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Senior U.S. officials and diplomats said Wednesday that President Obama is looking for a new strategy to deal with the Islamic State group and the regime of Bashar al Assad in Syria.", "title": "Obama\u2019s Syria reset: Officials tell CNN White House wants new strategy", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/12/obamas-syria-reset-officials-tell-cnn-white-house-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/24/77e00a05797c8c25600f6a706700e509.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/09/24/77e00a05797c8c25600f6a706700e509.jpg", "description": "Senior U.S. officials and diplomats said Wednesday that President Obama is looking for a new strategy to deal with the Islamic State group and the regime of Bashar al Assad in Syria.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama\u2019s Syria reset: Officials tell CNN White House wants new st"}, "Author": "Douglas  Ernst", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Politics, Syria, CNN, Iraq"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc38\"", "article_summary": "News of the changing strategy comes weeks after it was reported that Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel sent a private memo to Susan Rice about serious reservations regarding Mr. Obama\u2019s Syria strategy.\n\u201cThe long running Syria problem is now compounded by the reality that to genuinely defeat ISIL, we need not only a defeat in Iraq but a defeat in Syria,\u201d one government official told CNN on Wednesday.\nIn an ideal world you would drive ISIL out of Iraq and pivot to Syria.\nBut if by then the moderate opposition has been smacked and ISIL is still there, that doesn\u2019t help,\u201d a senior administration official told CNN.\nSenior U.S. officials and diplomats said Wednesday that President Obama is looking for a new strategy to deal with the Islamic State group and the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria."}
