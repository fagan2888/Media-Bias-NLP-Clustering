Beginning in July 2016, long-term care (LTC) facilities will be required to report staffing and census information quarterly through PBJ to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\n\u201cThe deadline is quickly approaching and many facilities are still unclear about their PBJ reporting strategy,\u201d said Beth Baerman, Director of Communication at Attendance on Demand, Inc. \u201cAttendance on Demand can help remove the burden of PBJ reporting. It also automates status determination for the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and ongoing evaluation of variable hour employees \u2013 common in healthcare.\u201d\n\nIn addition to census data, CMS expects detailed accounts of each employee\u2019s service, including job title, services performed, and daily number of hours worked. As a registered vendor with CMS, Attendance on Demand automatically collects the required reporting information and meets the PBJ\u2019s technical specifications for successful submission. It produces the formatted upload file, which includes:\n\n\n\nEmployee ID\n\nHire Date\n\nTermination Date\n\nWork Type\n\nPay Type\n\nHours Worked\n\nJob Title and Labor Category Code\n\nWith the reporting deadline looming, LTC facilities need to begin preparing for PBJ reporting.
