Brookings, SD

Former South Dakota State University standout running back Zach Zenner announced Saturday night that he has received an offer to join the Detroit Lions as an undrafted free agent.

A three-time consensus All-American, Zenner became the first player in Division I football history to rush for 2,000 yards in three consecutive seasons. He gained 2,044 yards in leading the Football Championship Subdivision in 2012, tallied 2,014 in 2013 and racked up 2,019 yards as a senior in 2014. His 6,548 career rushing yards are a Missouri Valley Football Conference record and rank third in FCS history.



Zenner, a native of Eagan, Minnesota, crossed the 100-yard mark in 32 games and topped the 200-yard mark eight times as a Jackrabbit. He also holds the MVFC record for career all-purpose yards with 8,211 as he also tallied 909 receiving yards and 754 yards on kickoff return during his collegiate career.
