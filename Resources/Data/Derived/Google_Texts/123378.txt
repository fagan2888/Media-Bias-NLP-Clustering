Pamplona Capital Adds to Packaging M&A with Charter Nex

The deal follows transactions from Pretium Packaging and Sonoco

Private equity firm Pamplona Capital Management LLP is buying Charter Nex Films Inc. for an undisclosed amount.

Charter Nex makes polyethylene films used in the packaging of a wide range of products, including food and medicine.

Pamplona plans to grow the company organically and through add-on acquisitions. The firm is investing through its fourth fund, Pamplona Capital Partners IV LP, a $4 billion fund that closed earlier this year.

The deal marks an exit for private equity firm Mason Wells.

Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC acted as Pamplona's financial adviser, while Hogan Lovells US LLP provided legal advice. Houlihan Lokey Capital Inc. advised Charter Nex on the deal, while Quarles & Brady LLP acted as legal counsel.

The packaging sector has hosted many M&A transactions recently. In December, Pretium Packaging acquired Tri-Delta Plastics, and Sonoco's (NYSE: SON) deal for Weidenhammer Packaging Group for $383 million in August.
