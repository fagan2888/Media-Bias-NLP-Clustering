Author Susan E. Wills, JD, LLM, examines the latest scientific studies and explains how IUDs and so-called \u201cmorning after pills\u201d have been shown to occasionally prevent newly created embryos from implanting in the uterine wall, therefore facilitating early abortion.\n\nThe report looks at the current state of the science regarding the three most common types of emergency contraception available in the United States: the Copper-T IUD (marketed as ParaGard\u00ae T 380A Intrauterine Copper Contraceptive), Ulipristal acetate (marketed as Ella\u00ae and ellaOne\u00ae), and levonorgestrel EC or LNG-EC (marketed as Plan B\u00ae, Plan B One-Step\u00ae and Next Choice\u00ae).\n\n\u201cAs we await a decision from the U.S. Supreme Court regarding the HHS mandate, this timely research sheds light on the fundamental difference between abortion and the prevention of pregnancy. These are simply not the same and we can only have a good outcome when the terms are properly understood,\u201d said Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute. \u201cThis review of the newest research confirms the Obamacare mandate as a blunt and sweeping assault on the freedom of conscience of those who oppose the killing of human embryos.\u201d\n\nClick \"like\" if you want to end abortion!\n\n\u201cGiven the dangers to the future of conscience rights posed by the Affordable Care Act, an honest debate over the \u2018contraception mandate\u2019 is a necessity,\u201d concludes author Susan E. Wills, JD, LLM. \u201cNumerous studies have shown that the most popular emergency contraceptives can cause the death of embryos. For the sake of full and accurate informed consent for patients and for the sake of the integrity of the medical profession and research community, this reality must be acknowledged. Only then will we be able to make informed decisions about our personal healthcare and healthcare policy.\u201d\n\nIn August 2011, Department of HHS Secretary Sebelius herself said that the mandate includes drugs that are \u201cdesigned to prevent implantation\u201d of embryos, causing abortion.\n\nThe Charlotte Lozier Institute was launched in 2011 as the education and research arm of Susan B. Anthony List. The CLI is a hub for research and public policy analysis on some of the most pressing issues facing the United States and nations around the world.
