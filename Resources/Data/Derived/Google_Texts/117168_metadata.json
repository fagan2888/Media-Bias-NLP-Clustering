By way of background, two supporters of Obamacare (Jonathan Chait and Dr. Douglas Kamerow) locked horns with two opponents of the law (McArdle and Dr. Scott Gottlieb) in a formal debate on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side last week. The proposition in question was whether the Affordable Care Act is beyond rescue. The winner of these \u201cIntelligence Squared\u201d debates is determined by which side persuades more attendees over the course of the event, as measured by audience polls conducted before and after the presentation. On that metric, the Obamacare critics won big:\n\nPrior to the exchange, just 16 percent (!) of the audience was inclined to agree with McArdle and Gottlieb\u2019s position. (Here\u2019s a sense of just how out of touch Manhattan\u2019s elites are on this issue). By the debate\u2019s conclusion, that number doubled to 32 percent. Convincing nearly one-third of an UWS audience to adopt a conservative-leaning viewpoint is, shall we say, a challenge:\n\nYou\u2019re looking at a map of how New York City\u2019s precincts voted in the 2012 presidential election. Obama won the city in dominant fashion, carrying 81 percent of the total vote. Romney\u2019s only strongholds were in Staten Island and certain neighborhoods of Brooklyn \u2014 plus a few tiny outposts in Queens and the Bronx. It doesn\u2019t appear that the Republican won a single precinct in all of Manhattan. The Upper West Side, where this Obamacare debate was held, is that navy blue block just west of Central Park. Obama took many of these precincts with more than 90 percent of the vote. Gov. Cuomo\u2019s purge wouldn\u2019t take much effort in New York City, it seems.\n\nRecently in the Green Room:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Video: Obamacare critics defeat proponents in NYC debate", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Greenroom", "description": "Mary Katharine touched on this Megan McArdle piece last night, but I figured it\u2019d be worth posting AEI\u2019s handy recap video of the event described in her column. \u00a0By way of background, t\u2026", "title": "Video: Obamacare critics defeat proponents in NYC debate", "url": "http://hotair.com/greenroom/archives/2014/01/24/video-obamacare-critics-defeat-proponents-in-nyc-debate/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/newsgraphics/2012/1124-nycvote/1124-webNYCVOTE.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-24T20:26:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-01-24T19:55:27+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd34aa\"", "article_summary": "The Upper West Side, where this Obamacare debate was held, is that navy blue block just west of Central Park.\nVideo: Obamacare critics defeat proponents in NYC debateposted at 3:26 pm on January 24, 2014 by Guy BensonMary Katharine touched on this Megan McArdle piece last night, but I figured it\u2019d be worth posting AEI\u2019s handy recap video of the event described in her column.\nOn that metric, the Obamacare critics won big:Prior to the exchange, just 16 percent (!)\nBy way of background, two supporters of Obamacare (Jonathan Chait and Dr. Douglas Kamerow) locked horns with two opponents of the law (McArdle and Dr. Scott Gottlieb) in a formal debate on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side last week.\nRomney\u2019s only strongholds were in Staten Island and certain neighborhoods of Brooklyn \u2014 plus a few tiny outposts in Queens and the Bronx."}
