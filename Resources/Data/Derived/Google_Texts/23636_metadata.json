But when leaders at the Oakwood, Georgia-based company introduced a high-deductible health plan option to their 1,000 salaried employees two years ago, they quickly entered the murky world of medical pricing.\n\n\u201cWe talked about needing people to be better consumers,\u201d said Helen Nelling, director of compensation and benefits. \u201cThat they should question cost, they should question treatment, they should question quality.\n\n\u201cAnd some of our employees said, \u2018How do I do that?\u2019 I called my doctor and asked how much an office visit was, and my doctor\u2019s office wouldn\u2019t tell me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWayne Farms isn\u2019t alone in wading into unfamiliar territory around health care costs. Medical pricing practices have been ambiguous: joint-replacement surgery, for example, can fluctuate wildly from $15,000 to more than five times that amount, though an expanding array of third-party vendors, and insurance plans are starting to shed light on pricing and quality. Experts say that as high-deductible plans proliferate, such cost tools and related strategies will become increasingly important to help create a more price-savvy employee and ideally curb chronically rising medical costs in the process.\n\nThe hurdle now facing employers is persuading their workforce to look at and consider the cost of medical procedures. Pushing beyond posters and other educational efforts, some employers have decided that they need to make changes in their benefit design to further motivate their employees.\n\nFrancois de Brantes, executive director at the Health Care Incentives Improvement Institute, said high-deductible plans are exerting a Trojan horse effect, \u201cawakening the general public and individual plan members to the absolutely insane way in which health care prices are being set today and in which health care services are being paid for today.\u201d\n\nHigh-deductible plans are forcing employees to shoulder heftier chunks of their own medical bills. For 2013, 20 percent of insured employees are enrolled in a high-deductible plan with the option of an attached savings account, such as an HSA \u2014 compared with just 8 percent in 2009, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research & Educational Trust annual benefits survey. The rollout of the health exchanges next year through the Affordable Care Act is anticipated to further accelerate that trend, as high-deductible plans will look attractive, given their lower upfront premium costs.\n\nWayne Farms last year contracted with San Francisco-based Castlight Health, a third-party vendor that helps employers provide their workers with detailed information about cost and quality. Nelling and other leaders also are considering changes in benefit design, including reference pricing, in which the employer agrees to only cover a procedure up to a certain amount.\n\nThis summer, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, known as CalPERS, reported that it saved $5.5 million in just two years by using that approach with knee- and hip-replacement surgery. Another emerging benefits design strategy, now being analyzed by companies like Dallas-based Oncor Electric Delivery Co., is bundled payments. Leaders there hope to negotiate a one-stop charge for common joint surgeries that afflict the energy company\u2019s active workforce of linemen and meter readers.\n\nRevised Tools\n\nMeanwhile, insurers like Cigna are developing and revising pricing tools for their members. The insurer relaunched its tool last year so users could dig beyond the basic doctor-search level by clicking through various links to assess the cost and quality not only of doctors but also hospitals and tests, said Marie Jinks, Cigna\u2019s director of eBusiness, who led the launch.\n\n\u201cWhen we talked to our customers, we found out that they really did have an interest in learning more about the cost and the quality of their health care,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they didn\u2019t necessarily know where to look.\u201d\n\nThe online tool gets about a million basic searches each month; roughly 1 in 4 users delve further, Jinks said. For example, a member who needs a stomach doctor \u2014 the online site avoids terms like gastroenterologist \u2014 and related tests can sift through not only what individual physicians charge, but also the total cost depending upon where the tests are conducted. The estimated bill can then be broken down based on that employee\u2019s insurance coverage, including how much of the annual deductible has already been spent.\n\nWhile the usability of such insurer tools has improved, so-called gag clauses continue to pose a significant hurdle, said Ted von Glahn, a senior director at the Pacific Business Group on Health. Providers \u2014 frequently those with significant leverage in a given area \u2014 can prevent the release of cost information. (In Cigna\u2019s case, Jinks says gag clauses only block about 1 percent of health provider\u2019s information from insured members, although a spokesman later added that there may be other gaps, such as when there are insufficient claims to fairly reflect prices for a given procedure.)\n\nVon Glahn described one tool he had seen the prior day, which contained cost details from less than 20 percent of the contracted health providers serving that San Francisco region. \u201cA very nice tool with a nice interface with consumers, well-organized and all that,\u201d said von Glahn, who reviews pricing tools for his coalition\u2019s employer members. \u201cBut it\u2019s blank.\u201d\n\nAnother sticking point: how to accurately measure quality. Health insurers and vendors take pains to highlight that their pricing tools incorporate such measures. Castlight Health lists its resources, including Medicare data, physician standards set by the American Board of Medical Specialties and patient-satisfaction ratings aggregated from public websites. Cigna also provides a similar list.\n\nBut ongoing disagreements over risk adjustment and other assessment methods, including among medical providers, has made it difficult to provide a nuanced quality picture of individual doctors or hospitals, said Tom Billet, a senior consultant at Towers Watson & Co. If people don\u2019t trust the methodology, particularly when surgery or other high-stakes medical care is involved, Billet said, \u201cthey end up using price as a proxy for quality. They think, \u2018Oh, if they\u2019re charging more, it must be better.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA study published in 2012 in the journal Health Affairs backs up Billet\u2019s assertion that price point alone doesn\u2019t influence patient decisions when choosing treatment options. The study, which looked at how to present cost and quality information, didn\u2019t find any evidence that high-deductible plan users were any more price-sensitive. \u201cI don\u2019t quite know what\u2019s driving that \u2014 it was surprising,\u201d said Jessica Greene, a study author and professor at George Washington University.\n\nOverall, the study\u2019s participants gravitated toward imaging centers that performed more scans, believing that more is inherently better, she said. And a high-cost doctor wasn\u2019t necessarily a deterrent.\n\nOne focus group participant, she said, captured the prevailing mindset with the following comment: \u201cSince I really can\u2019t judge the competency of an M.D., I would assume the guy who charges more and gets away with it must have a reason for it. He must be good. Otherwise, he couldn\u2019t continue that kind of practice.\u201d Greene said that the moderator then asked if information about quality would alter that perspective. What if the high-cost doctor\u2019s care was shown to be only about average compared with higher-caliber doctors? The participant\u2019s response: \u201cI would absolutely change my mind.\u201d\n\nDesigning Benefits\n\nAt CalPERS, leaders launched their hip- and knee-replacement initiative in 2011 because they were seeing a startling spread in the hospital charges \u2014 from about $15,000 to nearly $100,000 \u2014 \u201cwith no real rationality\u201d driving the difference in terms of the quality, said Ann Boynton, the system\u2019s deputy executive officer of benefit programs policy and planning.\n\nTo prompt members to consider pricing differences, leaders worked with Anthem Blue Cross of California to create a list of high-value hospitals based on quality, geographic access and a joint replacement cost of $30,000 or less, not including the surgeon and other charges. For those 41 hospitals, members paid only co-insurance, which maxed out at $3,000 annually. If they chose one of the 72 nondesignated hospitals, they were also responsible for any costs surpassing the $30,000 threshold.\n\nBefore the initiative, 52 percent of surgeries were performed at nonvalue hospitals in 2010. By 2012, that rate had declined to 36 percent. Even more intriguing, the average cost of a hip or knee replacement declined from $34,742 in 2010 to $25,611 in 2011, driven nearly entirely by pricing declines in nondesignated hospitals. The average price held steady at $25,471 for the first nine months of 2012.\n\n\u201cIt tells us that the industry paid attention to what we were doing,\u201d Boynton said, \u201cand found a way to reduce those prices.\u201d\n\nCurrently, just 5 percent of employers use reference pricing. But an additional 15 percent plan to adopt the strategy in 2014, according to the annual employee benefits survey by Towers Watson and the National Business Group on Health.\n\nTo date, the \u201cdearth of quality information has been a limiting factor\u201d for employers considering reference pricing, von Glahn says. Setting a price limit for a complex procedure, such as a heart bypass, is difficult if patients don\u2019t have confidence in the underlying quality measurements, he said.\n\nThe risk, von Glahn said, is that \u201cpeople are going to react negatively and either rightly or wrongly assume that this is a cost-driven service, and it\u2019s going to be of subpar quality.\u201d\n\nBoynton said that CalPERS hasn\u2019t gotten much pushback about quality worries, perhaps because the value list includes some high-profile names, such as California hospitals Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in West Hollywood and Stanford University Hospital in Palo Alto. A few other procedures for CalPERS members now also incorporate reference pricing, including outpatient cataract surgery.\n\nAny further additions will be carefully evaluated with the focus on elective procedures only, Boynton said. \u201cIf it\u2019s any kind of close to an emergent or acute situation, people aren\u2019t going to go onto their iPhones to look at which facility is cheaper,\u201d she said.\n\nAnother drawback with reference pricing is that it might not capture unanticipated costs that can arise in the course of medical treatment, said de Brantes of the Health Care Incentives Improvement Institute. For example, what if a screening colonoscopy leads to a biopsy?\n\nSimilar to purchasing the entire car, rather than the tires and other individual components, insurance providers should negotiate prices for the entire treatment episode, said de Brantes, who prefers the bundled payment approach. \u201cThen the plan member can, with accuracy, predict what the total cost would be if she went to provider A vs. provider B vs. provider C.\u201d\n\nIn North Carolina, Blue Cross and Blue Shield has been piloting bundled payments for knee-replacement surgeries in four locations beginning in 2011, said Dr. Brian Caveney, vice president and medical director at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina. The approach not only gives the self-insured employer the peace of mind of a set price, but also provides employees more support as they navigate the various phases of treatment, he said. It \u201cgets everybody aligned such that there tends to be one nurse or care coordinator that helps the person through that whole system,\u201d he said.\n\nThe insurer now is talking to some health providers about adding other procedures, Caveney said. Some possibilities: hip replacement, heart bypass surgery and possibly even bundling payment for the treatment of heart failure for a given plan year.\n\nAs of this summer, Oncor Electric was negotiating bundled payments for common joint procedures, said Kerri Veitch, the company\u2019s senior director of total rewards. Ideally, a bundled rate would provide both the employer and employee a flat price regardless of any issues that might arise, she added.\n\nIndividual Buy-in?\n\nAt Wayne Farms, Nelling looks forward to having a year\u2019s worth of data so she can get a better sense whether cost details have influenced employee choices. Cigna officials are in the process of analyzing the use of its new online tool; Jinks hopes to have results by early 2014. \u201cWe\u2019re specifically trying to concentrate on: What information did they seek, and did the information they saw change their behavior?\u201d Jinks says.\n\nOncor Electric leaders have already identified some cost savings related to employee choice after hiring Compass Professional Health Services in the summer of 2012. To date, Compass has assisted nearly 200 employees, saving them more than $115,000 in claims savings related to price analyses, said Oncor spokeswoman Megan Wright. The company plans to start promoting such success stories to its employees.\n\nWright could start with her own experience, after suffering what she initially thought was food poisoning this spring. Since it was the weekend, she sought help at an urgent-care center. The clinicians there suggested she consult a gastroenterologist for a second opinion. Before doing so, though, she contacted a Compass health consultant, who provided a cost analysis.\n\nThe projected bill for the three local gastroenterologists, including related tests they might request, such as an endoscopy, ranged from $2,000 to $3,000. Wright, who is enrolled in a high-deductible plan, would have been responsible for about $1,500. She decided to visit her family doctor first. He prescribed antibiotics and, in the end, told her a specialist\u2019s input wasn\u2019t needed. \u201cI felt better physically and mentally,\u201d she said, \u201cknowing that I got to save that amount of money.\u201d\n\nCharlotte Huff is a writer based in Fort Worth, Texas.
