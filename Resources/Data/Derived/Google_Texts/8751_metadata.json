(AP) - Companies have long invested in corporate gyms as part of hopes to boost productivity through healthier employees.\n\nThe Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center didn\u2019t miss that trend. Since 2001, the research and office park has maintained a paid gym on its campus to give both the general public and employees of the many small companies there a recreational outlet during the lunch or after-work hours.\n\nBut the CRC\u2019s fitness options have been a bit more expansive than the usual weight and exercise room subtly slotted between floors and rooms of cubicles and offices.\n\nIn the 1990s, the CRC opened outdoor beach-style volleyball courts to try to meet the diverse recreational interests of its tenants and has since steadily added similar amenities.\n\nWithin the past year, the park opened a soccer field on its northwest end off Innovation and Research Center drives that has been used by teams in a regional adult soccer league. Not too far away, the park recently finished painting the lines on a field that looks to have been established primarily for lacrosse.\n\nAnd the outdoor entities aren\u2019t finished.\n\nThe CRC is currently finishing a fourth volleyball court near the lacrosse field and plans to put a second basketball court within the next month on either Pratt or Kraft drive.\n\nCRC President Joe Meredith said one of the intentions of alternative recreational venues like the soccer field or basketball court is to simply help the companies entice potential employees by offering fun activities they can enjoy at lunch or after work.\n\nMeredith said the outdoor venues also allow employees from different companies to meet and forge relationships that could benefit their businesses later.\n\n\u201cIt also causes networking to take place \u2026 which is something you can leverage to your benefit,\u201d Meredith said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to compete against another team without at least wanting to know what the person on the other team does for a living.\u201d\n\nBrian Badillo, a programmer at CRC-based software development firm Harmonia, has played for local soccer teams for about three years now and was in a game at the park\u2019s field earlier this month.\n\nBadillo said the fields and courts give the employees there more diverse options for getting in shape. Getting fit doesn\u2019t have to be limited to pumping iron or walking the treadmill at the gym, he said.\n\n\u201cI like soccer, and I wanted to get back into it because it\u2019s one of those things to do for exercise,\u201d he said.\n\nBadillo added: \u201cThe gym is kind of a chore, and going off to play outside is a little less of a chore. Having things like that caters to people of different needs, different interests. Somebody might be interested in soccer like me, others might be interested in volleyball and some people might be interested in weightlifting.\u201d\n\nBadillo said he also thinks putting fitness venues - whether it be a weight room or an athletic field - next door to the office is more convenient for some people\u2019s schedules and \u201cbreaks motivational barriers.\u201d He said it\u2019s much easier for some to start working out when the amenities are not far.\n\nFor himself, Badillo said trying to stay fit is important because his job often demands that \u201cI stay in my seat all day.\u201d\n\nOthers like Amy Richardson, who works at pharmaceutical research company Revivicor, stick to the more conventional fitness routines, but say the same thing as basketball or soccer players when it comes to accessing neighboring workout facilities.\n\nRichardson often frequents the CRC\u2019s exercise room, which is located just across the street from her work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good to be active,\u201d she said after finishing a lunch hour session. \u201cI live in Giles County, so I don\u2019t get home until 6 o\u2019clock in the evening. So it\u2019s good that I can come at lunchtime and just get it over with and not have to worry about it in the evenings.\u201d\n\nRichardson said the lunch time workouts re-energize her for the remainder of the work day.\n\nAn article published by the Houston Chronicle on the benefits of corporate gyms stated that exercise improves sleep, and therefore can improve employee morale by giving them more energy throughout the day and releasing \u201cmood-elevating endorphins.\u201d\n\nThe same article said companies that started fitness programs saw increased productivity through reductions in use of sick leave and fewer employees who missed work.\n\nThe article said an office gym is also an attractive perk for recruiting and retaining workers and a convenience for employees who either have busy schedules or don\u2019t want to drive far to work out.\n\nMeredith said the CRC will continue to increase its fitness options as \u201cwe grow the density of the employees.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the park began offering yoga classes just near its administrative offices.\n\nWhile not a sports venue, the park\u2019s pavilion was also expected to have 15 picnic tables, a bump from the two to three tables there previously.\n\nThat move also involves the addition of a grill, but Meredith didn\u2019t give an exact timeline for when the outdoor cooking appliance will be available.\n\nAnd Meredith said, \u201cwe actually have a group of people advocating for a bocce ball court.\u201d\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Roanoke Times, http://www.roanoke.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Companies have long invested in corporate gyms as part of hopes to boost productivity through healthier employees.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Companies have long invested in corporate gyms as part of hopes to boost productivity through healthier employees.", "title": "Va.
