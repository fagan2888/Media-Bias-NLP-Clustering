years, I said it a thousand times \u2013 while something needed to be done about our crumbling, outdated infrastructure, they should never have pushed ahead with a bloated, incompetently-managed project that produced some good results \u2013 the Ted Williams tunnel and the recovered Greenway land \u2013 and plenty of bad ones, most notably the wretched roads and bridges that ruin our tires on a daily basis.\n\nRegrettably, the same thing is happening with health care reform.\n\nListen to Jon\u2019s commentary\n\nKeller @ Large: Washington Pols Have Lessons To Learn From Boston's Big Dig playpause\n\nAnd our political leaders seem intent on making the same mistakes in response to problems that a previous generation did with the Big Dig.\n\nMegan McArdle of Bloomberg News, a respected journalist specializing in health care coverage, reports that the feds are considering extending for the long-term what was supposed to be a short-term program to bailout insurance companies that lose money on the policies they offer in the early years of Obamacare, an increasingly likely prospect due to bureaucratic miscalculations of market response to it.\n\nIf they follow through, she notes, it would show that despite spin to the contrary, they believe the serious problems with Obamacare\u2019s financial viability are here for the long-run, not short-term \u201cglitches,\u201d and that key promises they made about health care reform producing deficit reduction and cost control were at best unrealistic, at worst, a joke.\n\nThe promises made for the Big Dig were similarly bogus.\n\nBut what really infuriated the public was the way politicians and bureaucrats tried to hide the truth from us.\n\nThe pols in DC would do well to learn from that, and avoid making a bad situation much, much worse.\n\nYou can listen to Keller At Large on WBZ News Radio every weekday at 7:55 a.m. You can also watch Jon on WBZ-TV News.\n\nMORE POLITICAL NEWS FROM CBS BOSTON\n\n", "article_metadata":
