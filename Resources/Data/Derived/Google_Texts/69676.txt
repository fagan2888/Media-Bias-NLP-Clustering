Small businesses and Affordable Care Managers paid price when Diversified Restaurant Holdings made ACA changes

When Southfield-based Diversified Restaurant Holdings Inc. implemented changes in line with the Affordable Care Act in 2013, it was the company's managers who were most affected.



"They went from paying zero (premium) dollars to a significant amount," said Michael Ansley, president and CEO of Diversified. "It really hurt our managers."



The holding company is the largest franchisee for Buffalo Wild Wings and owner of the Bagger Dave's Burger Tavern chain. It reached $128 million in revenue last year and has about 4,500 employees.



As a restaurant business with many part-time employees, Diversified faced a special dilemma. The ACA broadened tax rules that say employers cannot discriminate by offering different plans to different employees. This broadening affected Diversified's health care plan, and as a result the company had to move managers to a new group policy plan that is shared with hourly employees.



"We don't like it, but we have to look for other ways and benefits that give us a competitive advantage," said Ansley.



The company now only offers health insurance to those who work 30 hours or more a week to allow full-time workers the financial flexibility of three different health care plan options.
