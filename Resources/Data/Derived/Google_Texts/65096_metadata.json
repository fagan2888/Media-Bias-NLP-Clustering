Accounts of John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination on the 50th anniversary of that event have reminded us that this form of confusion predated the Internet and cable news. But today the news cycle has sped up, ravenously seeking new fodder in a matter of days rather than weeks. By the time more responsible investigators have nailed down the facts, the public is often no longer paying attention.\n\nFor this reason, there\u2019s more call than ever for books like Matthew Lysiak\u2019s \u201cNewtown: An American Tragedy.\u201d Lysiak, a reporter for the New York Daily News, covered the story of the mass shooting that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., a year ago on Saturday. At the time, the press misidentified the murderer, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, as his older brother, Ryan. (Adam was carrying Ryan\u2019s ID when he shot himself at the end of his rampage.) There were reports that Lanza\u2019s mother, Nancy, worked at the school and was killed during the shooting. (Her son shot her three times in the head that morning as she lay in bed, then left the house for Sandy Hook.) And there was talk of a second shooter \u2014 actually a parent, apprehended then cleared by law enforcement officials when they arrived at the scene. Depending on when you checked out of the coverage, you might be harboring all sorts of erroneous ideas about the tragedy.\n\n\u201cNewtown\u201d is a just-the-facts narrative, and Lysiak is no prose stylist; he has an unfortunate propensity for clich\u00e9s and dangling participles. But this book shows a deeper grasp of how to assemble those facts into a meaningful picture of events, and it is tremendously moving in the simplicity of its presentation. Lysiak balances perfectly the ordinarily wondrous lives of the 20 children and six women who were murdered against their killer\u2019s depravity. Lysiak is a master of texture, at selecting precise, individualizing details: the first-grader who asked her mother for extra tissue paper to wrap the gingerbread house she planned to make at school that day, the way Sandy Hook principal Dawn Hochsprung sometimes snuck her paperwork with her into the stands when attending school athletic events, the \u201cplush blue shark\u201d slipped into one small coffin.\n\nLysiak\u2019s account of the shooting itself, which lasted about five minutes, and the events leading up to and following it are tersely horrific. The slaughter of so many innocents makes Sandy Hook one of the darkest nightmares in the ever-growing list of America\u2019s lone-gunman sprees, but it does have a heartening counterpoint in the selfless courage of the women who died that December morning trying to protect their charges. Hochsprung gave her life to warn her colleagues of the danger, first-grade teacher Victoria Soto stepped between Lanza and her students, and when teacher\u2019s aide Anne Marie Murphy could not hide 6-year-old Dylan Hockley from the murderer, she wrapped her body around his in an attempt to shield him.\n\nWithin a day or two of this atrocity, everyone was arguing about its cause and significance, and these debates become part of Lysiak\u2019s narrative as well, though not to the point of overwhelming the story of Newtown and its citizens. The loudest rhetorical clashes occurred between gun control advocates and Second Amendment absolutists like the firearms-industry-funded NRA, but other debates raged as well: over the import of Lanza\u2019s diagnosis of Asperger\u2019s syndrome and whether reporting this was prejudicial to people with autism, as well as Lanza\u2019s obsession with video games. Interest groups fearing stigma or regulatory crackdowns sought to deflect fault elsewhere: The gun nuts blamed the video games and a lack of adequate mental health care, the gamers blamed Lanza\u2019s parents, and advocates for people with autism blamed the gun industry. If there was a paucity of information, there was certainly no shortage of opinion and argument.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new book on the school shooting last year offers a clearer picture of one of America's darkest hours", "title": "\u201cNewtown\u201d: The truth about Sandy Hook", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "A new book on the school shooting last year offers a clearer picture of one of America's darkest hours", "title": "\u201cNewtown\u201d: The truth about Sandy Hook", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/12/08/newtown_the_truth_about_sandy_hook/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/newtown_american_tragedy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new book on the school shooting last year offers a clearer picture of one of America's darkest hours", "title": "\u201cNewtown\u201d: The truth about Sandy Hook", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/12/newtown_american_tragedy.jpg", "creator": "@magiciansbook", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Laura Miller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Adam Lanza, Autism, Books, Crime, Editor's Picks, Gun Control, Must-Do, Sandy Hook Elementary Shooting, School shooting, School Violence, Video, What to Read", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcebb0\"", "article_summary": "(Her son shot her three times in the head that morning as she lay in bed, then left the house for Sandy Hook.)\nFor this reason, there\u2019s more call than ever for books like Matthew Lysiak\u2019s \u201cNewtown: An American Tragedy.\u201d Lysiak, a reporter for the New York Daily News, covered the story of the mass shooting that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., a year ago on Saturday.\n\u201cNewtown\u201d is a just-the-facts narrative, and Lysiak is no prose stylist; he has an unfortunate propensity for clich\u00e9s and dangling participles.\nThe slaughter of so many innocents makes Sandy Hook one of the darkest nightmares in the ever-growing list of America\u2019s lone-gunman sprees, but it does have a heartening counterpoint in the selfless courage of the women who died that December morning trying to protect their charges.\nBut today the news cycle has sped up, ravenously seeking new fodder in a matter of days rather than weeks."}
