The Dallas Arboretum opened its newest attraction Saturday afternoon at a ribbon-cutting for the Rory Meyers Children’s Adventure Garden.

Arboretum board members and city officials honored the garden’s namesake, Dallas philanthropist Rory Meyers, and many donors who funded the $62 million project at a dedication ceremony. A marching band from Townview Magnet Center performed, a choir from St. Mark’s School of Texas sang and actors dressed as colorful frogs and bugs wandered through the crowd.

Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings declared Saturday “Rory Meyers Children’s Adventure Day” with a proclamation and commended donors for supporting the garden despite a difficult economy.

In a speech, Howard Meyers said naming the garden after his wife, Rory, was a fitting gift because she has long championed children’s education and health. When he saw a model of the children’s garden, he told the Dallas Arboretum’s president that he was interested in funding it.

“This was something in her heart and that’s why we did it,” Meyers said after the dedication ceremony. Now, he said he looks forward seeing his granddaughter and all of Dallas’ children learn and play there.

In a surprise announcement, the Meyers family received a gift of their own. A friend announced the creation of the Rory Meyers Angel Fund. The endowment will cover the cost of travel and admission for low-income families.
