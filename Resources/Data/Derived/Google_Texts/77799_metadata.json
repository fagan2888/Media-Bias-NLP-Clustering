Now a new survey that polled recent retirees about their standard of living has found that, for some, you don\u2019t need a lot of money each year to retire comfortably and live happily.\n\nAccording to the survey by Baltimore-based investment firm T. Rowe Price, recent retirees report living on 66 percent of their pre-retirement income on average \u2013 $58,000 annually \u2013 and say they\u2019re very satisfied.\n\nHalf of the 1,507 people surveyed say they\u2019re living as well or better than when they were working. Most say they\u2019re better off financially than their parents were at that age.\n\n>> Slideshow: 10 Consumer Spending Regrets\n\n\u201cThe key finding is that retirees are making their retirements work,\u201d says Anne Coveney, a senior manager at T. Rowe Price. \u201cWhat\u2019s impressive is that they\u2019ve adjusted their spending and their satisfaction is quite high.\u201d\n\nThe retirees surveyed had a 401(k) or IRA and a median household savings, including any home equity, of $473,000.\n\nRetirees typically have fewer expenses than people in other age groups. They no longer pay for work-related costs, for example. And by the time they\u2019re retired, their children \u2013 and the expenses that go along with them \u2013 are gone.\n\nAccording to a J.P. Morgan Asset Management study in March, consumer spending peaks at age 45 and then declines in all areas except health care. The study also found that retirees don\u2019t seem to need as much income to be content. After spending hit $40,000 annually, their satisfaction in retirement increased only incrementally.\n\nSo can boomers retire with less than financial experts recommend? Generally, advisers say retirees need at least 75 percent of their annual pre-retirement income to maintain their standard of living and reduce the risk of outliving their savings. In other words, if you earned $100,000 a year, you\u2019d need about $2.25 million to last 30 years.\n\nRelated: Check Out These Work and Retirement Tools\n\nDave Richmond, president of Richmond Brothers, a wealth management company in Jackson, Mich., says it\u2019s easier than you may think to live on a smaller percentage of replacement income.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re still living with a mortgage and you have [consumer] debt, you\u2019re going to need a higher percentage of your pre-retirement income,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you made $100,000, you no longer need to save the maximum $23,000 in a 401(k). That\u2019s a 23 percent savings. And now you\u2019re in a lower tax bracket from 25 percent to 15 percent. That\u2019s another 10 percent savings. So now you\u2019re saving 33 percent [of pre-retirement income] right there. Now you\u2019re down to 66-67 percent.\u201d\n\nLiving on less is not what Sacha Millstone, a senior vice president of investments at Raymond James & Associates in Boulder, Colo., says her newly retired clients want. They plan to spend about as much as they did when they were working.\n\n>> Get travel discounts with your AARP Member Advantages.\n\n\u201cI have been practicing for 30 years and I do a lot of work preparing people for retirement and managing their accounts after they retire,\u201d she said. \u201cI can tell you my clients are spending much more than 66 percent of their pre-retirement income and much more than $58,000 annually. They want to do things they couldn\u2019t do when they were working. The first years of retirement they tend to make more trips \u2026 and they spend more.\u201d\n\nThe survey also reaffirmed how important Social Security is to a retiree\u2019s lifestyle. The government benefit was by far the most important source of income for retirees, accounting for 43 percent of what they brought in, the survey found. Pensions made up 19 percent. Funds from retirement plans, personal savings and investments accounted for 18 percent of their income.\n\nPhoto: Hatman12/iStock.com\n\nAlso of Interest\n\nSee the AARP home page for deals, savings tips, trivia and more", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "En espa\u00f1ol | Financial experts seem to speculate endlessly about boomers\u2019 projected lifestyle in retirement based on their savings and spending patterns.
