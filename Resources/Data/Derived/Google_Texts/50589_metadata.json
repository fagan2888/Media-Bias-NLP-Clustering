And while the Act presents many new challenges for insurance companies, the digitization of information and data opens up enormous opportunities, including health care payments.\n\nUntil now, payments in the health care sector have been lagging far behind the consumer world, where you can tap a smartphone or credit card to buy a carton of milk, pay just about any bill online, and where even the IRS returns tax refunds electronically.\n\nThe inefficiencies of staying glued to paper health care payments add up to $190 billion dollars of waste every year. According to the American Medical Association, providers who opt for electronic payment will save about $2,000 per doctor per year. And faster payment means better cash flow for all stakeholders, including the patient.\n\nBut the move is taking time. According to a recent McKinsey study, many digital health care strategies are still driven by information that simply isn\u2019t true. The study resoundingly debunks myths that have been fueling a resistance to digital health care payments \u2014 and shows that the public is more than ready.\n\nBut are insurance companies \u2014 and the VC community \u2014 responding?\n\nThis is one of the questions asked in HealthBeat\u2019s session, \u201cThe future of health care payments.\u201d\n\nMalay Gandhi, managing director of Rock Health; Rajaie Batniji, co-founder & chief health officer of Collective Health; and Vidya Raman-Tangella, VP at United HealthCare Innovation Resource will explore the role of providers, VC players, and payers themselves \u2014 and how digitizing payments can improve efficiencies and quality of care.\n\nThis is just one of the many HealthBeat sessions featuring some of the most innovative companies working in health technology today.
