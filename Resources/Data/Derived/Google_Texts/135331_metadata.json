For Clinton, it may be less a question of whether she\u2019ll win in November, than of how\u2014and what she\u2019ll do next. I\u2019ve been talking to a diverse set of political insiders, including many who are close to Hillary Clinton, to understand what form a genuinely transformative presidency might take. I\u2019ve distilled those conversations into a faux memo, as I did in 2013 and 2015, to sketch the difference between merely winning, and actually succeeding. To: Hillary Subject: Winning Right Congratulations! You are now the presumptive Democratic nominee. Considering the demographic obstacles piled against Donald J. Trump, you\u2019re this close to the presidency. The nation\u2019s first woman president. Heir to President Obama\u2019s legacy. Latest from Politics The Humbling of Paul Ryan It\u2019s not enough. Is your goal to win the presidency or to win and transform the presidency? Are you a caretaker or a change agent? Do you seize power for the love of power or for higher purposes: to modernize the institutions of politics and governance; to restore the public\u2019s faith in Washington; to break the cycle of polarization and solve big problems; to galvanize the youth vote (like Obama) and translate millennials\u2019 passion and power into governmental reforms (unlike Obama)? Back in 2013, the first memo in this sequence predicted: \u201cThe next president of the United States (Democrat or Republican) will be a populist.\u201d It urged you to run a campaign that was radically accessible, honest and authentic, small and nimble, and populist. You didn\u2019t. Trump did. So did Bernie Sanders.\n\nThen in 2015, the second memo chastised you for the email scandal and advised you how to come clean. You didn\u2019t. \u201cThe country needs better,\u201d that second memo said. \u201cStop being the problem. Be the Hillary we once knew.\u201d You\u2019ve got one last chance. The general election is an opportunity to surprise people by putting forward an agenda that goes beyond liberal checklists and tackles the structural impediments to reform. Listen to Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who told the New York Times on Wednesday that you must focus on how best to connect to a broader electorate that is in what he called a \u201crevolutionary mood.\u201d He was referring to how Sanders has energized supporters. \u201cYou are not going to win this general election by proposing incremental changes,\u201d Murphy said, adding that he hoped you won\u2019t \u201cshy away from proposing some big ideas to try to reorder the country, to the benefit of those that are hurting.\u201d For what it\u2019s worth, here are 10 such ideas: Redistricting Reform The president can\u2019t single-handedy change how House districts are drawn, but presumably you will digitize and modernize Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s bully pulpit\u2014and could influence a grassroots movement forcing state legislatures to draw competitive districts that that incentivize compromise. Election Reform Start by making the Democratic nominating process more democratic (goodbye, superdelegates) and then recognize the fact that a majority of Americans are dissatisfied with the red-blue duopoly. Make it easier to run for office without pledging allegiance to the Democratic and Republican parties. Political Money The Citizens United ruling allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited sums on politics has created a new Gilded Age of politics. The Washington Post found that nearly half the money raised by Super PACs came from just 50 mega-donors and their relatives. Reversing the ruling is improbable and would not fix the corrosive system that existed before Citizens United.
