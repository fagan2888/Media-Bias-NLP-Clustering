Calvin Pickard’s remarkable rookie run met an end Sunday when the Avalanche dropped the 22-year-old goaltender back to the minor leagues.

“He needs to see a lot of action,” Colorado coach Patrick Roy said of Pickard, who was sent back to play for the Lake Erie Monsters of the American Hockey League.

Pickard on Saturday allowed four goals in the Avs’ 5-2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks in Denver. But the game was not an audition for Pickard to stay in the NHL, Roy said.

“No. Zero,” Roy said. “If he had a shutout or a bad game, it would have nothing to do with it. And I didn’t think he had a bad game. I thought he played well. It’s just the situation we’re in.”

The Avs will lean on No. 1 goalie Semyon Varlamov almost exclusively.

Roy said he told Pickard to prepare for a possible call-up in the middle of January, when the Avs play on back-to-back nights at Washington and at Carolina, on Jan. 12 and 13.

“Varly is 100 percent. And we’re going to play him a lot. Period,” Roy said.

Pickard, who is 6-6-2 in net with a team-leading 2.21 goals-against average and a .934 save percentage, started the season in the American Hockey League, and has been called up to the Avs three times.

Varlamov, who last week returned from a groin injury, has played about 50 percent of the season. He’s 5-6-5 with a 3.01 GAA and .913 save percentage.

Second-year backup Reto Berra remains with the Avs as Varlamov’s emergency relief.

The Avs also dropped first-year forward Dennis Everberg to the American Hockey League Sunday. Defenseman Nick Holden will take Everberg’s place as a fourth-line forward Monday in a game against the Blues in St. Louis.The Avs will field a roster with only 20 players, Roy said.
