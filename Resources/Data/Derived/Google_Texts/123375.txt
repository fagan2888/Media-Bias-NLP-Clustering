Holzer Health System to cut 100 jobs: 4 things to know

Gallipolis, Ohio-based Holzer Health System is making cuts to its workforce, according to a Gallipolis Daily Tribune report.

Here are four things to know about the cuts.

1. Holzer plans to eliminate about 100 jobs throughout southern Ohio and western West Virginia.

2. The affected jobs are mostly in "non-direct patient care positions," health system officials said, according to the report.

3. Holzer officials attributed the cuts to changes in healthcare service delivery models due to the Affordable Care Act, while also noting shrinking inpatient volumes and reduced Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. About 65 percent of Holzer's patients are covered by government insurance. "Our entire staff works tirelessly to reduce operational costs and to streamline operations while continuing to provide excellent care to our patients," Christopher Meyer, DO, Holzer Health System CEO, said, according to the Gallipolis Daily Tribune. "While these efforts helped us to maintain our nonprofit community hospital system, unfortunately, it has not been enough to address the sweeping changes in the healthcare environment. This national situation placed us in a regrettable position. We must now take additional action to ensure the long-term financial health and stability of Holzer so that we may continue providing the excellent healthcare our patients deserve for many years to come."

4. According to the report, Holzer employees affected by the cuts will be offered separation pay and other outplacement services, such as job placement assistance and career support.
