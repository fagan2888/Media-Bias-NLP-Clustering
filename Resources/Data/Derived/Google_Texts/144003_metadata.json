Although some experts question whether throwing money at the issue will be enough, many believe that, if used properly, the funding has the potential to save lives.\n\nThese people would never cheat the system\u2026 Right?\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly half a million Americans died from drug overdoses between 2000 and 2014. Opioid overdose deaths, including those from heroin, hit record highs in 2014 and saw a 14% increase in only one year.\n\nBaltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen, who has worked as an emergency room doctor in one of the nation\u2019s opioid addiction hotspots, said the proposal signals a shift in thinking about addiction as an individual\u2019s problem best controlled with law enforcement, to a chronic medical condition like diabetes or heart disease that can be prevented and treated.\n\n\u201cThat science has been around for decades, and society\u2019s perception has caught up,\u201d Wen told FoxNews.com.\n\nIn 2014, 259 million opioids \u2013 or enough for every American adult \u2013 were prescribed, according to the CDC. The most commonly prescribed opioid pain relievers were natural or semi-synthetic opioids like oxycodone and hydrocodone, which are involved in the most overdose deaths among opioids. The CDC recorded 813 more deaths, a 9% increase, from these types of opioids in 2014 than 2013.\n\nOver the last decade, overall deaths resulting from opioid abuse and abuse of illegal narcotics like heroin have quadrupled.\n\nA study published in the November 2015 issue of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggested overdoses from drugs like opioids is one of the main reasons why deaths of middle-age white Americans are rising while the overall death rate in the United States has fallen.\n\nDr. Melinda Campopiano, a medical officer at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), who both prescribes opioids and treats patients who have become addicted to them, said when she was in medical school in the \u201990s, professors taught students using the sickest of patients. That approach may have skewed the risk-benefit factor for stronger drugs like opioids versus over-the-counter medication like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or acetaminophen, she said.\n\nAn assumption at the time that pain was undertreated in America overall led many doctors to readily prescribe opioids as it was.\n\nCampopiano added that the trend of overprescribing opioids may also have emerged from a well-intentioned effort to standardize care across the board. At that point, evidence emerged that pain in minorities particularly was being undertreated\u2014a bias that data suggest still affects minority and less-wealthy patients today.\n\nData shows opioids are among the most addictive drugs on the market. Although experts dispute their efficacy for chronic pain and there\u2019s no perfect pill for every type of pain, the drugs change the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain, generating a euphoric or relaxing effect. But the longer and more frequently an individual takes an opioid, the more they\u2019ll need to take to get the same sense of relief.\n\nDespite increased public knowledge of opioids\u2019 risks, ideals pushed by Big Pharma and the federal government still persist in doctors\u2019 offices. All too often, doctors don\u2019t offer patients alternatives to opioid prescriptions, nor do they always ask about their mental health or addiction history, Campopiano said. Patients want to get better and trust their doctors, so they often don\u2019t challenge their judgment.\n\nIn May 2015, the CDC urged doctors to prescribe fewer painkillers and encouraged patients to ask questions themselves about alternatives.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has already added a boxed warning, the most serious type, to immediate-release opioid painkillers, but it hasn\u2019t yet added warnings to benzodiazepines and opioids to warn doctors and the public of their harmful reactions. Wen and other health officials have petitioned the FDA to do so.\n\nBut instead of giving it time to work\u2026 If passed, Obama\u2019s proposal would allocate $920 million to expand their treatment capacity and make services more affordable, $50 million in National Health Service Corps funding to expand access to substance use treatment providers, and $30 million toward researching the efficacy of treatment programs in place and then improving them.\n\nThat opioids are often a bridge to heroin abuse has made the epidemic even more pressing for health officials to address. About 80% of people who use heroin started doing so by using prescription pain medication, according to government data. This may happen when a patient can no longer obtain pricier opioids and turns to the street for potentially tainted painkillers or heroin.\n\nCDC data suggests deaths linked with illegal fentanyl, a strong, less expensive opioid commonly added to or disguised as heroin, are increasing.\n\nIn Baltimore, where 527 people died of heroin-related causes in the first nine months of 2015, combatting the epidemic has involved expanding availability of anti-overdose antidotes narcan and naloxone. Wen has issued a blanket prescription to everyone in Baltimore, where residents can take a 10-minute online training course to learn how to administer them.\n\nMany experts like Saloner argue that criminalizing addiction, which is listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)\u2014 as part of the nation\u2019s \u2018war on drugs\u2019\u2014 has failed, leading to recidivism and wasted tax dollars.\n\n\u201cWe tried criminalizing addiction, and we didn\u2019t make a dent in the epidemic\u2014and in some ways, we made it worse by driving a lot of harmful behaviors in the ground,\u201d Saloner said. \u201cYou don\u2019t make a meaningful or sustained impact on this problem until you create a collaborative and person-centered model, until you recognize this is someone with a medical condition.\u201d\n\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA) required plans in the Health Insurance Marketplace to cover substance use disorder services, but overcoming stigma is one of the biggest hurdles faced by doctors and patients affected by opioid addiction.\n\nThe bottom line: More money out of your pocket to help those who refuse to help themselves.\n\nSource: Fox News", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obama wants to spend over $1 billion to make it even easier for junkies to access opioids.", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Hornet - News That Stings!", "description": "Amid a prescription opioid abuse and heroin use epidemic largely fueled by overprescribing among doctors, President Obama has suggested allocating $1.1 billion to expand affected individuals\u2019 access to care - a proposal that has garnered bipartisan support.
