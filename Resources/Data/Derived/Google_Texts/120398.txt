KEY RUN

Just when Kansas appeared close to taking control, the Shockers scored 13 of the first half’s final 15 points. A KU bucket to begin the second half trimmed Wichita State’s lead to 29-28. But WSU answered with a 12-2 spurt. Ballgame.

UNSUNG STAR

No debate here. It was Evan Wessel. He’d scored in double digits just four times before Sunday. Then, against Kansas, the junior hit a career-high four 3-pointers, three of them in the second half.

STAT-SHEET STUFFER

Two guys deserve mentions. Point guard Fred VanVleet had 17 points, six rebounds, six assists and four steals for Wichita State while Kansas’ Devonte’ Graham finished with 17 points, three assists and five steals off the bench.

HIGH RISER

Wichita State’s Tekele Cotton. The senior guard tried to throw down a one-hand slam on the 6-foot-10 Landen Lucas. Didn’t quite get it. Cotton lost the ball, but it fortuitously skipped off the glass and fell through the hoop for two points. Cotton, fouled on the play, hit a free throw to tie the game at 26.

COULD HAVE GONE EITHER WAY

Zach Brown had just deflected a pass, and the ball was loose on the floor. Either he or KU’s Kelly Oubre Jr. was going to get it as it bounced toward the scorer’s table. A foot race. Brown won. And the reward: a free path to the hoop and a monster two-hand dunk.

WHAT WAS THAT?

The big screen showed a close-up camera shot of a fan’s T-shirt late in the game. It had the Wichita State and Kansas logos on it. Naturally, the entire crowd booed. The bipartisan culprit? Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback.

OUR TAKE

The Shockers wanted it more. They got every loose ball, used their physicality to disrupt the KU offensive flow and found a way to make the big shots when it counted. The better team won.

THEY SAID IT

“To me this is probably one of the biggest wins I’ve been involved with being a Shocker, just because we don’t get the opportunity to play KU, and we’re going to the Sweet 16. Both tremendous achievements.” — junior guard Ron Baker
