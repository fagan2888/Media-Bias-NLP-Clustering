Now that 89 Accountable Care Organizations have just joined Medicare's Shared Savings program, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has updated its database of the current list of 405 ACOs. The data includes the coverage area and geographic location of each ACO, the names of the executive in charge and public contact information on each organization.

To make it easy to peruse the data, Healthcare Finance has created the below map and data list. Hover over each marker to see the name of the ACO and click on the markers to access deeper information about the organizations. We've also included the full list underneath the map.

The Department of Health and Human Services recently set ambitious goals to encourage healthcare providers to form more ACOs, saying it wants to see at least 30 percent of Medicare payments tied to these value-based models by the end of 2016.
