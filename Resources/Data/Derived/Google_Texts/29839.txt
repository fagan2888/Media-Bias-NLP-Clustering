Obamacare limped along Wednesday as officials in New York and around the U.S. struggled to deal with a flood of Web traffic by people seeking information.

New York’s new online insurance marketplace — NYStateof Health.ny.gov — has attracted more than 30 million visits since it opened Tuesday, Executive Director Donna Frescatore said.

But visitors to the site Wednesday faced a second day of frustrating log-in problems and processing delays.

“There is no question that the volume of Web visits that we’ve had over the course of the last two days exceed any projection that we might have made,” Frescatore said.

Officials were working to boost the website’s ability to handle more traffic, she said.

The health insurance marketplaces operated by New York, other states and the federal government are a cornerstone of President Barack Obama’s health care reform.

The marketplaces outside New York also struggled Wednesday to boost capacity.

The Obama administration hopes to sign up 7 million people for insurance during the first year of the program.

Frescatore said figures on how many people had enrolled in New York since Tuesday morning were not available.
