It requires health care providers to enter patients\u2019 test results into Electronic Health Records or EHRs in an effort to use this information at the point of care, while also making it more readily available among providers and regulatory agencies. The purpose of the requirement is to improve the quality of care through improved communication, thus reducing the cost for care by decreasing follow-up visits, procedures and complications.\n\nFurthermore, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has taken the aspect of improved care a step further by implementing an incentive program where providers can be rewarded financially for positive patient outcomes.\n\nOne method to improving care across the board is to modernize the way health care records are stored and shared. Electronic health care records not only are leading to better patient outcomes, but also to a new breed of professionals \u2014 those who work on the cutting edge of health care and technology, otherwise known as the emerging field of health informatics.\n\nThe term health informatics describes the acquisition, storage and use of information to improve patient care by allowing for direct collaboration among patients\u2019 health care providers. In this manner, health informatics uses concepts, theories and practices to achieve improved health care outcomes. It is the perfect marriage of information technology and health care.\n\nCareerBuilder.com recently ranked health informatics as the No. 1 job opportunity in an emerging field. The Bureau of Labor Statistics expects employment of health information specialists to grow by 23 percent through 2022 \u2014 far exceeding the growth of all other occupations in the country. The field is also well compensated, as the bureau reports the median salary for health information managers is $88,500 with the top 10 percent in the field earning about $150,600. The bureau projects the demand for this management segment to grow by 15 percent over the same period of time.\n\nAcross the country, institutions of higher education have responded to the demand for these highly trained health informatics professionals by developing programs that provide the training, experience and qualifications needed to work in the area of health care and technology.\n\nMisericordia University, for example, offers two options in health informatics \u2014 an 18-credit master\u2019s certificate and a 36-credit master\u2019s degree. The courses, which are designed to give students real-life exposure to health information technology, are taught by full-time informatics professionals and executives in the field. The program is the only one of its kind in Northeast Pennsylvania. With it being fully online, interested students also are not limited by geography.\n\nVirtually all program participants at Misericordia University work in the health care field and have a basic understanding of information technology. As the industry clamors for more highly trained professionals, we can expect health informatics to become a mainstream program at many colleges and universities in the not-too-distant future.\n\nJOSEPH J.
