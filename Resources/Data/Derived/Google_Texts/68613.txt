The general public was not his intended audience, so you probably missed this, but House Speaker Paul Ryan delivered a speech a few days ago that was a near-perfect encapsulation of why #NeverTrump Republican Party elites are seriously considering launching a third party.

And what the speech showed, basically, is that their motivations have less to do with Donald Trump and the GOP’s fate in the 2016 election than they let on. It isn’t about Trump and the present; it’s about the future and themselves.

Ryan delivered his speech in the House Ways and Means Committee’s hearing room, and his audience was “a couple hundred” interns on Capitol Hill. The theme of the speech, he said, was “the state of American politics.” That was only true in a technical sense; the real subject was Donald Trump. How can you be sure? Because, paradoxically, Ryan didn’t mention Trump’s name even once.

Here’s what he mentioned instead: A future, better America in which politics isn’t about “playing to [voters’] anxieties” but rather “appeal[ing] to your aspirations”; in which politicians “don’t resort to scaring you” and “don’t just oppose someone or something”; in which voters and politicians alike “don’t lock ourselves in an echo chamber” or “take comfort in the dogmas and opinions we already hold.”

An America, in other words, that would never cotton to the likes of Donald Trump.

But if that were the sum total of Ryan’s speech, it wouldn’t be noteworthy. You could easily boil all of the above down to a generic “Kumbaya” platitude. A fair number of those criticisms could indeed be leveled against “both sides.” In the end, it was when Ryan started talking not about Trump, but about himself — specifically, his previous “makers vs. takers” rhetoric — that things got interesting.
