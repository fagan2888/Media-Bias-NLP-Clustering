President Obama took up a theme championed by Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio Wednesday â€” declaring economic inequality "the defining challenge of our time."

"It drives everything I do in this office," Obama said, repeating calls to raise the minimum wage, boost unions, increase revenue for infrastructure and make college cheaper.

The speech is part of the President's push to shake off the sluggish start of Obamacare.

It was a bold rhetorical call that aligns Obama with progressives like de Blasio who are pushing an economic populism that Republicans and some Democrats call class warfare.

Obama said Americans fear "their kids won't be better off than they are." He said class mobility is now harder for children to achieve in America than it is in Canada, Germany or France.

"That should offend all of us," Obama said. "We are a better country than this."
