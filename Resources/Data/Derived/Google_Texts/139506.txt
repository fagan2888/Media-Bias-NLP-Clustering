Have you found yourself cutting some bread from your daily diet and adding a slice of turkey breast or a strip of bacon? If so, you’re far from the only one, and you are contributing both to a frenzy of multibillion-dollar corporate dealmaking and a major change in the agricultural industry.

As the WSJ’s Jacob Bunge reports:

This intensifying appetite for protein is one of the main forces driving Tyson Foods planned $7.7 billion acquisition of Hillshire Brands

Increasingly wealthy consumers in emerging economies are piling more meat on their plates and feeding their children more milk products.

In the U.S., meanwhile, some health-conscious consumers are replacing carbohydrates like bread and cereal with more animal protein, including meat, yogurt and eggs.

The trend has given rise to new meat-industry giants such as Brazil’s JBS and China’s WH Group, and is propelling sales by U.S. companies such as Hillshire, maker of Jimmy Dean sausages and Ball Park hot dogs, and Chobani Inc., the country’s biggest Greek yogurt brand.

It is also prompting farmers around the world to expand their production of meat as well as the corn, soybeans and other crops used to feed livestock.
