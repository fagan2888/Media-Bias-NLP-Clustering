Even in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to extend marriage equality to all 50 states, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has remained staunch in his opposition — and it’s upsetting his family. Unfortunately for Walker and other Republicans, this seems to be pretty common.

In a recent profile on Walker’s wife, Tonette, the Washington Post discovered that the soon-to-be GOP candidate’s sons were “disappointed” in their father’s response to the SCOTUS decision, which he called “a grave mistake” shortly after the ruling came down:

In the political world, Walker drew immediate scrutiny for being particularly strident. In their house, Tonette Walker heard immediately about her husband’s response from the couple’s two sons, Matt and Alex, who are taking time off from college to help their father’s campaign. She told them to talk directly to him. “That was a hard one,” Tonette said, pausing and choosing her words carefully. “Our sons were disappointed. . . . I was torn. I have children who are very passionate [in favor of same-sex marriage], and Scott was on his side very passionate.” “It’s hard for me because I have a cousin who I love dearly — she is like a sister to me — who is married to a woman, her partner of 18 years,” she said. She said her son Alex was her cousin’s best man at their wedding last year.
