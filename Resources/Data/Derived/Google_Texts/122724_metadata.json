Cupp 041414 [YouTube]\n\nCNN host S.E. Cupp made the case for the \u201cselfie\u201d in a video released on Monday, saying they were an expression of youthful mistrust of government.\n\n\u201cIf you think about it, millenials grew up at a time where they saw the government lead us into a housing boom and bust, lead us into two really expensive wars, saw an economy collapse,\u201d Cupp said in the video.\n\nCupp, one of the conservative commentators on Crossfire, did not mention that the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts and the economic decline began during Republican George W. Bush\u2019s presidency.\n\n\u201cThey saw the government try \u2014 and so far fail \u2014 to deliver a really good health care system,\u201d she continued, not mentioning that more than 7 million people have signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, implemented by Democratic President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.\n\nOn the other hand, Cupp argued, younger generations have looked to Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg and Google chief Sergey Brin as \u201ctheir heroes\u201d because they find ways \u201cto solve problems on their own.\u201d\n\nCupp did not mention that both platforms have been criticized by users for mining their data for advertisers\u2019 benefit. Google, in particular, has come under fire in San Francisco for allegedly sowing social inequality, which has already been blamed as a factor in at least one violent encounter in the city.\n\n\u201cWhy would a millennial say, \u2018Would you take my picture for me?,\u2019 when they know they can take their own picture better than anyone in the history of time?\u201d Cupp asked. \u201cYou know what? That\u2019s the millenial attitude and I\u2019m okay with it.\u201d\n\nWatch the video, as released on Monday, below.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.rawstory.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/S.E.-Cupp-041414-YouTube-800x430.jpg", "height": 430}, "title": "S.E.
