A Cottondale man in-connection with an alleged kidnapping is now behind bars after a two-day manhunt by Washington County deputies.

The Bonifay Police Department arrested 26 year old Christopher Cruz Walley at 7 p.m. Saturday at Pho Noodle and Kaboodle.

The Washington County Sheriff's Office tips line verified the vehicle Walley was believed to be traveling in was parked outside the restaurant. He's suspected of severely beating a young woman, then holding her against her will in the trunk of a vehicle.

Thursday night deputies were searching for Walley, including the area near his home on Corbin Road, west of Cottondale. Investigators say he was giving the victim a ride Wednesday when he allegedly attacked her and beat her unconscious.

She says she woke up in the trunk of the car. Authorities say Walley drove around with the woman in the trunk all day and night before she escaped around 1:00 pm Thursday on Eloise Road.
