Can you see how perverted that line of thinking is?\n\nTodd asked what happens if someone has an unwanted pregnancy \u2014 should they have a right to terminate it?\n\nNo. Think about this. During slavery \u2014 and I know that\u2019s one of those words you\u2019re not supposed to say, but I\u2019m saying it. During slavery, a lot of the slaveowners thought that they had the right to do whatever they wanted to that slave. Anything that they chose to do. And, you know, what if the abolitionists had said \u201cI don\u2019t believe in slavery, I think it\u2019s wrong, but you guys do whatever you want to do.\u201d Where would we be?\n\nIn 2013, Carson compared the Affordable Care Act to slavery, saying it was the worst thing that happened to America since slavery, adding \u201cit is slavery, in a way.\u201d\n\nSlavery was a brutal system that trapped millions and millions of people in bondage for over 200 years. Obamacare is a law that Congress passed which has helped 17.6 million people get health insurance through the private insurance market and existing government health care programs.\n\nEarlier this year, Carson revived the conspiracy theory that Planned Parenthood concentrated their clinics in black neighborhoods as a \u201cway to control the population.\u201d\n\nTodd then asked about an interview with Yahoo! News\u2019 Jon Ward wherein Carson would not say whether he wanted to see Roe v. Wade overturned. \u201cI favor life. That\u2019s what I favor,\u201d Carson had said in response to questions about the case. \u201cIt means that we will try to protect human life because all people in our country have a right to the protections of the law,\u201d he said describing the Supreme Court justices he\u2019d appoint \u2014 those who \u201cbelieve in life\u201d and \u201cunderstand that a baby in the uterus is a human being and is protected by the Constitution.\u201d\n\nCarson went farther than that on overturning the case on Sunday. \u201cI would like to see it done in the right way,\u201d he said, again mentioning an examination of the judges he would appoint, \u201chow have they behaved, who have they associated with, rather than what they say in an interview.\u201d\n\nOn the court case, Carson said \u201cultimately I would love to see it overturned.\u201d Asked whether that would contained exceptions, Carson said \u201cI\u2019m a reasonable person, and if people can come up with a reasonable explanation of why they would like to kill a baby, I\u2019ll listen.\u201d To Carson, an abortion in the case where the life or health of the mother is threatened was \u201cextraordinarily rare situation\u201d but that if that \u201crare\u201d situation occurred \u201cI believe there\u2019s room to discuss that.\u201d He said he \u201cwould not be in favor of killing a baby\u201d that came about because of rape or incest. He pointed to the \u201cmany stories\u201d of people who have led \u201cuseful lives\u201d after being born as a result of rape or incest.\n\nBen Carson has surged ahead of Donald Trump in recent Iowa polls, with Chris Wallace calling him the frontrunner there, citing an 84 percent favorability rating in a Quinnipiac poll on Fox News Sunday.\n\nIowa Republican voters find many of Carson\u2019s extreme statements attractive, according to a recent Bloomberg/Des Moines Register poll. However, one area of his biography that repels them is the fact that he conducted research using tissue from aborted fetuses.\n\nChuck Todd asked Carson about his sometimes inflammatory rhetoric, such as about the Holocaust and guns and his accusation that Obama is a psychopath.\n\n\u201cAs people get to know me, they know that I\u2019m not a hateful, pathological person like some people try to make me out to be,\u201d he said.\n\nChuck Todd asked why he so easily went to Nazi metaphors, like referring to the Gestapo when talking about health care. Carson said some rabbis had told him recently that he was \u201cspot-on,\u201d and blamed the media for being shallow and not thoughtful about his full meaning.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The neurosurgeon also said he would \"love\" to see Roe v.
