Nearly 75 endangered sea turtles are recovering in Panama City Beach after suffering a cold stun from the freezing temperatures earlier this week.

The first of dozens of turtles began showing up at Gulf World Marine Institute on Wednesday. Researchers and volunteers rescued the turtles from the Port St. Joe area in Gulf County.

When water temperatures drop below 60 degrees, the turtles go into shock and stop moving. Gulf world officials have been caring for the turtles by rehabilitating them in warm water.

The turtles are expected to be released near where they were found stranded next week.
