Terry McAuliffe, but embraces some of the governor\u2019s other spending priorities for mental health and economic development.\n\nNegotiators quickly struck the agreement after working over the weekend \u2014 a dramatic change from last year, when a months-long standoff over Medicaid delayed passage of a budget until the state was on the verge of a government shutdown.\n\nWith the House and Senate controlled by Republicans this year, and McAuliffe (D) making only a symbolic pitch to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, budget negotiators found fewer sticking points.\n\nThe compromise, which includes raises for state employees, teachers and college faculty, will come before the two chambers as early as Thursday.\n\n\u201cIt is our hope that this agreement can gain broad, bipartisan support in both chambers,\u201d House Appropriations Committee Chairman S. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk) and Senate Finance Co-Chairman Walter A. Stosch (R-Henrico) said in a joint statement.\n\nMcAuliffe praised Jones, Stosch and Sen. Charles Colgan (D-Prince William), the other co-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, for a budget process \u201cmarked by bipartisan leadership and cooperation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the beginning of this session I asked the General Assembly to pass a budget that closes our revenue shortfall while enhancing economic development, investing in expanded health-care services, protecting education and giving state employees a raise,\u201d McAuliffe said. \u201cI am pleased to see that the announced compromise honors those priorities and I look forward to reviewing it fully with my team over the coming days.\u201d\n\nThe plan also drew praise from leaders of the Republican-dominated House and the Senate, where the GOP holds a narrow 21-to-19 majority.\n\n\u201cThey have produced a conservative, responsible spending blueprint that wisely includes a rainy-day fund pre-payment, eliminates unnecessary debt obligations and onerous fees proposed by the Governor and invests in our state police officers and teachers,\u201d House Speaker William J. Howell (R-Stafford) said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe budget plan was expected to land on legislators\u2019 desks and appear online by Tuesday morning. A vote in both chambers could come by Thursday, following a 48-hour review period that House and Senate leaders established as a goal earlier this session to eliminate last-minute budget sausage-making.\n\n\u201cThis is a sound spending plan that includes no new taxes on hardworking families, invests in higher education and provides well-deserved pay raises to state employees, state police officers and our teachers,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Thomas K. Norment (R-James City).\n\nThe proposal would fund the state\u2019s share of a 1.5 percent teacher pay raise, a 2 percent college faculty pay raise, and a 2 percent raise for state police and other state employees. It also includes an early, $129.5 million payment to the state\u2019s rainy-day fund and plows $193 million into the teacher retirement fund.\n\nIt eliminates $11.7 million in fees, including an increase in restaurant inspection charges, proposed by McAuliffe. The plan restores $30 million in funding to local governments, cut last year, when revenue projections looked dim.\n\nThe General Assembly passed a two-year, $96 billion state budget last year. This year, the legislature and McAuliffe are proposing adjustments to that plan to cover the second year of the budget, which begins July 1.\n\nWork on those adjustments began last summer, when revenue projections indicated that the state would have a $2.4 billion shortfall. Meeting in special session in September, the House and Senate made cuts and found other savings to plug most of that, including cutting $60 million in aid to localities, leaving $272 million to address this session.\n\nSince then, revenue has picked up so that those extra savings did not have to be found, although some agencies still might feel the pain of earlier cuts. Budget negotiators recommend reversing $30 million of the cuts to localities, not the full $60 million.\n\nThe budget proposal includes $132 million for capital construction projects at James Madison, Virginia Tech, Longwood, Radford, Virginia Commonwealth University and Danville Community College.\n\nIt also includes $132.9 million to shore up the health-care safety net in a way more palatable to Republicans, who oppose McAuliffe\u2019s top campaign promise to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. It provides health-care and prescription drug benefits to 22,000 severely mentally ill patients, nearly doubles funding for free clinics to $6 million, and increases funding for children\u2019s psychiatry and crisis services.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The deal rejects fee increases and Medicaid expansion but embraces other McAuliffe spending priorities.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The deal rejects fee increases and Medicaid expansion but embraces other McAuliffe spending priorities.", "title": "Va. budget negotiators reach agreement", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/va-budget-negotiators-reach-agreement/2015/02/23/e6d10e1a-bb87-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, virginia budget, terry mcauliffe, chuck colgan, walter stosch, chris jones, obamacare virginia, medicaid virginia, bill howell,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "eomportal-uuid": "e6d10e1a-bb87-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "va politics, virginia politics, virginia budget, terry mcauliffe, chuck colgan, walter stosch, chris jones, obamacare virginia, medicaid virginia, bill howell,"}, "article_summary": "House and Senate budget negotiators announced on Monday that they have struck a deal that rejects the fee increases and Medicaid expansion sought by Gov.\nThe budget plan was expected to land on legislators\u2019 desks and appear online by Tuesday morning.\nThe General Assembly passed a two-year, $96 billion state budget last year.\nBudget negotiators recommend reversing $30 million of the cuts to localities, not the full $60 million.\nThe budget proposal includes $132 million for capital construction projects at James Madison, Virginia Tech, Longwood, Radford, Virginia Commonwealth University and Danville Community College."}
