As a young kid, Jamar wasn\u2019t sure yet just how much it meant for him. But speaking about it now, the 15-year-old is overwhelmed with joy at the idea of how much having a black president inspired him \u2014 and will continue to \u2014 even as President Barack Obama\u2019s presidency comes to a close in the next year.\n\n\u201cIt was just the beginning,\u201d Jamar said. \u201cIt gave me more of a sense of hope and self-confidence. People forget how even small ripples can change how a wave can move.\u201d\n\nReflecting on Obama\u2019s time in office during this Black History Month, young people say they are generally more hopeful and positive about Obama\u2019s presidency. Adults are hopeful as well but caution that there is so much work to be done.\n\nAre the lives of African-Americans better now than before the president took office in 2009?\n\nMore blacks have access to health care because of Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. More black adults are working as well. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the black community saw an 8.3 percent unemployment rate at the end of last year, compared with 16.1 percent in December 2009. And school dropout rates for blacks also have gone down.\n\nYet a Pew Research Center poll in August 2013 found that only about one in four blacks said their situation in this country was better than it was in 2009, when 39 percent held that belief.\n\nRacial tension\n\nAnother Pew poll found that 70 percent of blacks believe they are treated less fairly by police, compared with 37 percent of whites who hold that view. And the child poverty rate has held steady over the years for blacks but has declined for other races.\n\n\u201cThe African-American community was expecting him to be the Messiah, and he\u2019s not the Messiah,\u201d said the Rev. Al Combs of Christ\u2019s Church Apostolic, a small church off East Colfax Avenue in Aurora. \u201cHe\u2019s just a man.\u201d\n\nRacial tension is another concern. By reaching the highest level in the United States, Obama has brought the spotlight on the racial divide in this country, which some believe has gotten wider.\n\nHigh-profile fatal police shootings of black men, including in Ferguson, Mo., have caused civil unrest and suggest there is still much work to do in the fight against racism.\n\nThe Rev. Timothy Tyler of Shorter Community AME Church in northeast Denver said it is a misnomer to believe that having the country\u2019s first black president would be like \u201cclosing the book\u201d on all the problems African-Americans have endured over the years.\n\n\u201cThat was not the case,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s election did not make life better for black people, and in some instances it made it worse because of the reaction to it.\u201d\n\nJordan Grant, 18, a senior at Martin Luther King Jr. Early College, says oppressed communities found a voice through efforts such as Black Lives Matter.\n\n\u201cPeople are afraid of change,\u201d Grant said. \u201cBut Obama kind of instilled the mind-set around us that we\u2019ve seen progress and we can see more and the idea that we want to push forward to keep it going.\u201d\n\nFor Grant, the tensions also boil down to a lack of understanding for people who are different.\n\n\u201cI pray that, as time goes on, we continue to develop and that we continue to grow to be more understanding and more respectful of each other,\u201d Grant said. \u201cThat way we won\u2019t be so quick to judge.\u201d\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, Colorado\u2019s population of 5.4 million people in 2014 was nearly 88 percent white and 4.5 percent black, compared with 13 percent who are black nationwide. Aurora has the highest number of blacks in the state, 15.7 percent of its nearly 350,000 residents. The city saw an increase of almost 9 percent from 2010 to 2014.\n\nDenver Mayor Michael Hancock, who is black, points to numbers that show more people of color are enrolling in college. Obama\u2019s turnaround of the economy cannot go without praise, either, he said.\n\n\u201cHe pulled the nation back from the brink of economic depression,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cGenerally, you can say life in America has become much better since President Obama took office.\u201d\n\nEducation has been one area in which Obama has inspired younger black Americans.\n\nAt the Hill Campus of Arts & Sciences middle school in Denver, students are learning about African-American history and what it means for them.\n\nThis year, teacher Monique Roberts started a club \u2014 Black Power! \u2014 in which students are encouraged to learn about their history and feel comfortable exploring their identities. Roberts also started a group for Latinos.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure my students had a group where they could go where they could be undeniably themselves,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWe work toward self-esteem building and talk about how do we combat racism in our schools.\u201d\n\nFor Roberts, her own experiences and her research about racism help shape her work with her students.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re frequently one of the only black kids in a room, you tend to take on that burden of representing a group or wanting to make sure you don\u2019t let someone down, and in that you lose an authentic sense of self,\u201d Roberts said.\n\nBut having a person of color in the White House relieved her of that burden and may have for others as well, she said.\n\n\u201cIt was as if I didn\u2019t have to fight that battle on my own,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cMy students, they\u2019ve grown up in an era where they\u2019ve seen they can reach the highest levels. It\u2019s been an awesome eight years, but it\u2019s up to us as a whole community to maintain that appreciation of diversity and empowering our students.\u201d\n\nObama: Many things to many\n\nJarmell Johnson, 13, a seventh-grader in Roberts\u2019 Black Power! group, said seeing President Obama gives him hope, too.\n\n\u201cI would say don\u2019t be afraid to express yourself and just be positive about things you see,\u201d Jarmell said. \u201cDon\u2019t give up just because you don\u2019t think you have the power to do something.\u201d\n\nFormer Denver Mayor Wellington Webb said Obama\u2019s impact on the African-American community cannot be measured just by numbers. Webb, the first black mayor in Denver\u2019s history, said the president has had a positive effect on the \u201cnational psyche.\u201d\n\nHe points to the importance of black activists who worked for decades for racial equality being able to finally see an African-American as president and for the nation as a whole witnessing the Obamas in the White House.\n\n\u201cWhat a sight seeing his two girls growing up in front of your eyes playing on the south lawn \u2014 little girls to being teenagers,\u201d Webb said. \u201cIt sends a different signal to the world that you don\u2019t have to be white to be president in America.\u201d\n\nDenver school board member Allegra \u201cHappy\u201d Haynes, who is also Denver\u2019s executive director of parks and recreation, said Obama has meant many things to many people.\n\nHowever, just having a black president isn\u2019t enough to effect change. The country\u2019s youths must take the baton and continue to work hard to overturn racial inequities and disparities, she said.\n\n\u201cWhat it didn\u2019t do was say that we\u2019ve arrived, that now we\u2019re in a post-racial society, where race doesn\u2019t matter anymore,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cI think it\u2019s exactly the opposite. We found out it matters as much today as it did 50 years ago.\u201d\n\nLandri Taylor, a former board member for Denver Public Schools, said Obama\u2019s presidency has been monumental also for the things he has accomplished for minority communities.\n\n\u201cParticularly for communities of color, it refocused our whole mind-set about how important education is,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nAmong Obama\u2019s education initiatives is \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d aimed at local communities to create more opportunities for young men of color.\n\n\u201cKids that didn\u2019t think about being a president or U.S. senator or even a mayor now know that it\u2019s within their sight to achieve that,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThat has been just one of the greatest things that I see when I talk to young kids of color. We think that kids are blind to what\u2019s going on around them, but they are all very, very aware.\u201d\n\nCarlos Illescas: 303-954-1175, cillescas@denverpost.com or @cillescasdp\n\nUnemployment rate for blacks\n\nDecember 2009: 16.1 percent\n\nDecember 2010: 15.5 percent\n\nDecember 2011: 15.4 percent\n\nDecember 2012: 13.9 percent\n\nDecember 2013: 11.8 percent\n\nDecember 2014: 10.4 percent\n\nDecember 2015: 8.3 percent\n\nSource: U.S Department of Labor\n\nPercentage of those who feel they are treated less fairly by police\n\nBlacks: 70 percent\n\nWhites: 37 percent\n\nSource: 2013 Pew Research Center poll", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Black History Month: Young blacks see a different future after Obama", "title": "Black History Month: Young blacks see a different future after Obama", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/02/20/black-history-month-young-blacks-see-a-different-future-after-obama/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160220__DP_NGPS_TypeSetExport20160221_B1_CD21BLACKHISTORYp2.jpg", "height": 432}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160220__DP_NGPS_TypeSetExport20160221_B1_CD21BLACKHISTORYp2.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-02-20T19:50:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-18T04:24:11+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "group, said seeing President Obama gives him hope, too.\n\u201cGenerally, you can say life in America has become much better since President Obama took office.\u201dEducation has been one area in which Obama has inspired younger black Americans.\nHowever, just having a black president isn\u2019t enough to effect change.\n\u201cThat has been just one of the greatest things that I see when I talk to young kids of color.\nAmong Obama\u2019s education initiatives is \u201cMy Brother\u2019s Keeper,\u201d aimed at local communities to create more opportunities for young men of color."}
