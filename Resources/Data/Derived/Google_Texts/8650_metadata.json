Reader is set to return to team practices Monday, according to the school.\n\nReader missed his sixth consecutive game Saturday night for the fifth-ranked Tigers (5-0, 2-0 ACC) against Boston College. He took a personal leave of absence for undisclosed reasons on Aug. 25.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to be back Monday. Found out on Thursday, I believe, that he\u2019s ready to rejoin us. Excited about that,\u201d head coach Dabo Swinney said following the Tigers\u2019 34-17 victory. \u201cWe\u2019ll get him back to work on Monday. I have no idea what to expect. I haven\u2019t seen him. No idea where he is football-wise. Obviously it\u2019s been a while since he\u2019s practiced, much less played. The team knows he\u2019s coming back, we\u2019re excited to get him back out there to work, and we\u2019ll evaluate him as we go through the week.\u201d\n\nReader\u2019s father, David Sr., passed away at age 51 from complications of kidney failure on June 30, 2014. It is not known whether that loss was related to D.J. Reader\u2019s decision to step away from the team in late August.\n\nAsked the day of Reader\u2019s departure if the senior was being disciplined after a series of Reader-related inquiries, Swinney bristled and refused to answer further questions. Swinney said Saturday night Reader has been in school, and is on track to graduate in December.\n\n\u201cI have not had much contact with him. (Defensive tackles coach Dan) Brooks has been in contact with him. He\u2019s done some training, not here. But I know he\u2019s been working out,\u201d Swinney said. \u201cI texted with him the other day. That\u2019s about the level of communication we\u2019ve had right now. But he\u2019s excited. He\u2019s been focused on what he needs to focus on. Still got a lot of ballgames left, so hopefully he can have a strong, positive finish to his senior season.\u201d\n\nReader has played in 38 career games, starting four, from 2012-14. He has 110 tackles, including 7.5 tackles for a loss and 4.5 sacks with 21 quarterback pressures. Reader\u2019s best year so far was his sophomore season of 2013, when he made 43 tackles and 5 TFLs while playing 342 snaps for the Tigers, who won the Orange Bowl that year.\n\nReader, listed at 6-2, 325 pounds in the team\u2019s media guide, represented the Tigers\u2019 defense at the 2015 ACC Football Kickoff in late July.\n\nHis absence has not been felt significantly to this point by the Clemson defense, rated No. 13 in the country in total yards allowed.\n\nReader\u2019s roommate, junior Carlos Watkins, has started every game at defensive tackle as planned, and the combination of redshirt sophomore Scott Pagano and true freshman Christian Wilkins has not faltered through five games.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Clemson DT D.J.
