Again, our congratulations to the 113th Congress, which is now headed home for the holidays secure in the knowledge that no Congress in 40 years did less than it.* If you think about it like golf, the 113th Congress was America's Tiger Woods, complete with that meltdown.

But the 113th did do something. According to GovTrack, 234 laws were enacted because of the Noble 113th. This is, of course, the point at which some will step in to say, "Actually, we don't want Congress passing more laws, we have enough laws already," et cetera. Necessitating our rejoinder: It takes signed bills to revoke signed bills. (See: Affordable Care Act, The.)

Here, in all of its glory, is what the 113th Congress did, from first votes of passage in either chamber to passage by the full Congress to the signature of President Obama. For kicks, we added the nominations approved by the Senate. Making this, in essence, a map of the 113th Congress's productivity.

(This is small. Click on it and it will get big.)

If you think it looks as though a lot of what it got done got done recently, you're right. Here's another look at what it did, with the number of votes leading to a law by day on top of the number of bills signed into law. It is very, very bottom-heavy.

Despite taking off -- er, not being in session -- for months at a time, Congress still managed to hold votes and reshape the country, a little. Congratulations to the 535-plus people that made it happen.

* An update! GovTrack looked at bills that the president is expected to sign, and this Congress may squeak into second place on the all-time least productive list. We shall see!
