Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., took to the Senate floor one day later.\n\n\u201cThe border today is more secure than it has ever been,\u201d Heinrich said, adding, \u201cThere are more border patrol agents on the ground and more resources and technology deployed on the border than in any time in our nation\u2019s history. These resources have been effective.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been in more disagreement with them,\u201d Reay said. \u201cIt\u2019s an open border. It\u2019s not supposed to be, but it is. And when people cross the border other than (through) a port of entry, they have committed a violation of federal law.\u201d\n\nThe sheriff\u2019s coalition statement says, \u201cAmnesty is not the answer.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s been estimated at least 11 million people without documentation are living in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not talking about a roundup,\u201d Reay said. \u201cOur sheriffs realize that would be virtually impossible to do because it would have a huge economic impact on the communities they represent.\u201d\n\nInstead, Reay said, the sheriffs favor having undocumented workers come forward and take part in a pathway to legalization.\n\n\u201cWe believe the rule of law has a process in effect that should be followed,\u201d Reay told New Mexico Watchdog. \u201cCitizenship should not be automatic. Citizenship should be earned.\u201d\n\nThe statement makes nine recommendations calling for collaboration between federal, local and tribal law enforcement, including $1.1 billion for a justice assistance grant, $280 million in funding for high-intensity drug trafficking areas, $100 million for a readiness program along the border called Operation Stonegarden and unspecified funding for ICE\u2019s criminal removal program.\n\n\u201cThe government has already spent a great deal of money on border enforcement resources, last year alone spending close to $11 billion,\u201d Gaubeca said in an email to New Mexico Watchdog. \u201cCBP (U.S. Customs and Border Protection) is already the largest law enforcement agency in the nation. It doesn\u2019t need more help. In addition, DHS (the Department of Homeland Security) and CBP are already taking additional steps to build new detention facilities, including wrongly building more facilities for family detention when effective and cheaper alternatives exist.\u201d\n\nThe sheriffs offered five solutions to the border crisis, including required fingerprints, DNA swabs and iris scans for everyone apprehended while trying to enter the U.S. illegally.\n\nWouldn\u2019t that be expensive to administer?\n\n\u201cWhen you weigh the expense versus the benefit, absolutely not,\u201d said Reay, who didn\u2019t offer an estimate of the cost. \u201cBecause you are saving lives, you are identifying people later who are possibly criminals.\u201d\n\nReay said the statement will go to Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cThis will be put out to every member of Congress,\u201d Reay said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to get some of their attention so they can take action on it.\u201d\n\nClick here to read the sheriffs\u2019 coalition document.\n\nHere\u2019s the New Mexico Watchdog interview with Reay:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A coalition of sheriffs in the Southwest have issued a three-page statement calling for tougher and better coordinated programs to address the border crisis.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A coalition of sheriffs in the Southwest have issued a three-page statement calling for tougher and better coordinated programs to address the border crisis.", "title": "Sheriffs in the Southwest: The border is 'spiraling out of control' - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/border-patrol-agent-AP-photo.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-19T01:36:16+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/171012/border-out-of-control/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A coalition of sheriffs in the Southwest have issued a three-page statement calling for tougher and better coordinated programs to address the border crisis.", "title": "Sheriffs in the Southwest: The border is 'spiraling out of control' - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/09/border-patrol-agent-AP-photo.jpg"}, "creator": "@watchdogorg", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Arizona", "tag": "border crisis,Donald Reay,Harry Reid,Martin Heinrich,New Mexico Sheriff's Association,New Mexico Watchdog,Operation Stonegarden,Southwestern Border Sheriffs' Coalition,Texas Border Sheriff's Coalition,U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,Western States Sheriffs' Association", "published_time": "2014-09-17T08:45:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-19T01:36:16+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "immigration, illegal immigrants, illegal, undocumented workers, border patrol, border security, border fence, barack obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfc3d\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe immigration crisis has overwhelmed the capabilities of U.S. Customs and Border Protection and all the federal agencies attempting to assist in the efforts to secure our borders,\u201d said the statement, approved by the boards of the Western States Sheriffs\u2019 Association, the Texas Border Sheriff\u2019s Coalition, the Southwestern Border Sheriffs\u2019 Coalition, the New Mexico Sheriffs\u2019 Association and the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not just saying we have problems,\u201d said Donald Reay, executive director of the Texas Border Sheriff\u2019s Coalition, based in El Paso.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to get some of their attention so they can take action on it.\u201dClick here to read the sheriffs\u2019 coalition document.\nBy Rob Nikolewski \u2502 New Mexico WatchdogSANTA FE, N.M. \u2014 Sheriffs along the U.S. border with Mexico don\u2019t like what they\u2019re seeing.\n\u201cWe believe the rule of law has a process in effect that should be followed,\u201d Reay told New Mexico Watchdog."}
