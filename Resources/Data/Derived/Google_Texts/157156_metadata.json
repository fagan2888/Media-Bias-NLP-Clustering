In fact, hospitals are the largest employers in seven counties.\n\nPart of the recent contraction could be a result of too much success. Maine\u2019s hospitals are working hard at one of the core goals of health care reform: keeping people well with preventive and better-coordinated care, and keeping them out of the hospitals. While good for individuals and a brake on health care cost growth, fewer people in the hospital will inevitably put a dent in the bottom line for some hospitals.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to this story.\n\nThe U.S. health care system is splitting in two. In the states that accepted federal funds to insure more low-income people through Medicaid, hospitals have received a welcome shot in the arm.\n\nOne multi-state health system, Tenet Hospital, reported that hospitals in states that expanded Medicaid have experienced across-the-board increases in patient volumes, surgeries and outpatient visits. These hospitals also saw a bump in emergency admissions \u2013 unsurprising, given that some working poor men and women have been uninsured for years and have pent-up health needs.\n\nAt the same time, uninsured admissions were halved in expansion states. This is important, because when patients cannot pay because they are uninsured, hospitals still must treat them \u2013 and the \u201cfree care\u201d falls on the red side of hospital ledgers.\n\nHospitals in states that have refused federal Medicaid funds, including Maine, have received no such boost. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimates that those states will squander more than $420 billion through 2022 \u2013 funds that would flow into their state economies, boosting hospital revenues and bringing thousands of health care jobs.\n\nThe Maine Center for Economic Policy estimates that the $338 million in federal funds that would be directed to Maine each year would add half a billion dollars annually to Maine\u2019s economy and support 4,400 jobs staffing hospitals and caring for the newly insured.\n\nInsurance coverage has increased most in states that expanded Medicaid and also set up their own marketplaces for private insurance. Among those states, the highest percentage-point improvements in coverage were in Arkansas (10.1 percent) and Kentucky (8.5 percent), while the average was 4.4 percent.\n\nBy contrast, states that didn\u2019t expand Medicaid experienced a 2.4-percentage-point increase in coverage, largely because of the availability of more affordable private insurance coverage through health care marketplaces, whether state-run or federal. Maine, which is relying on the federal marketplace, fared slightly better, with a 2.8-percentage-point increase in coverage, partially because of coordinated enrollment efforts by a wide range of community organizations.\n\nIf Maine had expanded Medicaid in 2014, the level of coverage would have been greater. Instead, Maine\u2019s hospitals continue to pick up the tab for treating thousands of people who would be eligible for coverage but remain uninsured because of Maine\u2019s refusal to accept federal funds.\n\nExperience from other states clearly shows that these funds could pay for needed care and boost operating margins at hospitals throughout Maine. Many rural counties, where the percentage of uninsured is higher than average, would benefit most from the new jobs tied to the health care funds.\n\nWhile Maine\u2019s governor resists, some of his fellow critics of the Affordable Care Act are recognizing their error. Republican Gov. Matt Mead of Wyoming, for instance, recently began meeting with federal officials to talk about what expanding Medicaid in Wyoming might look like.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re handing (out) $200 million in free care just in Wyoming,\u201d Mead said recently. \u201cI contrast it with, I think it\u2019s about $60 million this year that if we were in Medicaid, we would have received.\u201d He plans to present his findings to the Wyoming Legislature when it reconvenes.\n\nAs a transformation in health care sweeps the nation, Maine is trapped in political amber, with many uninsured residents postponing care and hospitals losing money on those who do seek treatment. It\u2019s unfortunate that, unlike Gov. Mead in Wyoming, some policymakers in Maine still won\u2019t let the facts \u2013 and the numbers \u2013 convince them to remove their ideological blinders.\n\n\u2013 Special to the Press Herald", "article_metadata": {"description": "They're losing money at a time when extra federal funds could support 4,400 jobs and lift the economy.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "They're losing money at a time when extra federal funds could support 4,400 jobs and lift the economy.", "title": "Maine Voices: Maine hospitals suffering because of state's refusal to expand Medicaid - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 800, "identifier": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hospital1.jpg", "height": 573}, "updated_time": "2014-09-11T01:07:51-04:00", "url": "http://www.pressherald.com/2014/09/10/maine-voices-maine-hospitals-suffering-because-of-states-refusal-to-expand-medicaid/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "They're losing money at a time when extra federal funds could support 4,400 jobs and lift the economy.", "creator": "@pressherald", "image": "http://www.pressherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hospital1.jpg", "title": "Maine Voices: Maine hospitals suffering because of state's refusal to expand Medicaid - The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "site": "@pressherald", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=951845858", "fb": {"admins": 769488179, "app_id": 178078215650057}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pressherald", "section": "Columns", "published_time": "2014-09-10T04:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-11T01:07:51-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "QWs9pxQP8fwo2-nR5mWopc6qCK2D3920f7bl-U-zkso", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Hospitals in states that have refused federal Medicaid funds, including Maine, have received no such boost.\nIn the states that accepted federal funds to insure more low-income people through Medicaid, hospitals have received a welcome shot in the arm.\nThe analysis, prepared by the Maine Hospital Association for legislative candidates, also found that the number of Maine hospitals in the red for 2013 was double what it is in a typical year.\nMaine\u2019s hospitals are working hard at one of the core goals of health care reform: keeping people well with preventive and better-coordinated care, and keeping them out of the hospitals.\nSearch photos available for purchase: Photo Store \u2192Health care is a critical component of Maine\u2019s economy."}
