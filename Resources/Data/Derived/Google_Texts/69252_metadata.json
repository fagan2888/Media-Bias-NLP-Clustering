Some have insurance coverage for the first time, thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Others need a new doctor because theirs has retired or no longer accepts their insurance.\n\nAs a result, many patients are scrambling to find doctors. As with most new endeavors, some preparation beforehand is key; it can make that first visit more productive for all involved. Here are some things to consider:\n\nIf you have children, bring a record of their vaccinations. Your doctor cannot complete any day-care or school forms without that information.\n\nIf you have chronic conditions, bring a list of your medications and dosage information, or bring in all your pill bottles, so your doctor can refill your medications without interruption.\n\nYou should also bring any X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound results done within at least the last year, in case your doctor needs to refer you to specialists.\n\nIf you see a lot of specialists, inform them of the name and contact information of your new doctor to ensure continuity of care.\n\nBring copies of records from your last few visits with your previous doctor, so your new provider can have a better understanding of which issues to focus on.\n\nIf you are the caregiver for an elderly or disabled patient, make sure you have all the appropriate medical records, know the medical issues to address, and tell whether there was a specific event that prompted the appointment.\n\nBy following these simple suggestions, your doctor can focus immediately on your health and prevent delays in your care.\n\nCharmaine Chan, D.O., is a family-medicine physician at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine.\n\nRead more from the Check Up blog \u00bb\n\nMore Coverage Doctors often uncomfortable soliciting donations from patients\n\nOct 1 - 3:10 PM", "article_metadata": {"pubdate": 20160527, "editdate": "20151011T03:00:00", "twitter": {"url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/healthcare/Tips-for-your-first-visit-to-a-new-doctor.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/istock-doctor-visit1.jpg", "site": "@phillydotcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Tips for your first visit to a new doctor"}, "cg": "health", "keywords": "Charmaine Chan, D.O., For The Inquirer", "description": "Q: How do I prepare for my first visit with a new doctor? - Charmaine Chan, D.O., For The Inquirer, Philadelphia Inquirer", "byline": "Charmaine Chan, D.O., For The Inquirer", "contenttype": "Blog_Post", "publication": "Philadelphia Inquirer", "title": "Tips for your first visit to a new doctor", "livedate": "20151011T03:00:00", "verify-v1": "3x82DC93LZlv0I/hQEBoyVVjlGPtX7VxHFgv1upr+9I=", "news_keywords": "Charmaine Chan, D.O., For The Inquirer", "contentid": 331354842, "DC.date.issued": "2015-10-11T03:00:00-04:00", "fb": {"app_id": 938226082960499}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"site_name": "Philly.com", "description": "Q: How do I prepare for my first visit with a new doctor?", "title": "Tips for your first visit to a new doctor", "url": "http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/healthcare/Tips-for-your-first-visit-to-a-new-doctor.html", "image": "http://media.philly.com/images/istock-doctor-visit1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "searchdate": "2015-10-11", "google-site-verification": "db3T5L3C8_JvO-55gJ22lGGUnZLlNulgzTwX1NhCV3o", "y_key": "ccf0cd67e5f1e33c", "sourcepublication": "Inquirer"}, "article_summary": "Q: How do I prepare for my first visit with a new doctor?\nAs with most new endeavors, some preparation beforehand is key; it can make that first visit more productive for all involved.\nBy following these simple suggestions, your doctor can focus immediately on your health and prevent delays in your care.\nOthers need a new doctor because theirs has retired or no longer accepts their insurance.\nIf you see a lot of specialists, inform them of the name and contact information of your new doctor to ensure continuity of care."}
