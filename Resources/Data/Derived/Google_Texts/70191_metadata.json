Southern California is in the third year of drought. File/Watchara Phomicinda/Staff Photographer\n\nCalifornia\u2019s prolonged drought left an indelible mark on state water policy and homeowners alike in 2014.\n\nFor the first time in the raucous history of water in California, regulation of groundwater basins was approved, the state Water Resources Control Board gave local cities the power to hand out $500 fines to over users, and thousands of planet-conscious homeowners transformed their green lawns into desert landscapes.\n\nIn short, even if winter rains continue at what has been an above-normal clip and the story for 2015 is a busted drought, the behavioral and regulatory changes from the four-year drought may be permanent.\n\nThe passage of the Sustainable Ground Water Basin Management Act by the Legislature means 80 percent of the ground-water basins will eventually be subject to some kind of regulation. Only 23 out of 515 basins are currently adjudicated \u2014 mostly in urban regions \u2014 meaning they are subject to pumping limits by a court or court-mandated overseer. The 80 percent unmanaged basins are mostly in farm-rich San Joaquin Valley, where water regulators say a Wild West mentality is fading away.\n\n\u201cThat kind of management is unsustainable,\u201d said Kenneth Manning, a veteran water manager who once managed the massive Chino Basin and is now executive director of the San Gabriel Basin Water Quality Authority. The new law is a sea change in state water policy, he said.\n\nLikewise, 2014 saw the state water board demand water conservation plans from 400 water agencies. In addition, it required water use reporting for the first time and enabled everyone to compare residential water in gallons per person per day (R-GPCD) starting in September. What some call your water number \u2014 a new tool developed this past year \u2014 varied greatly from city to city.\n\nWhile Los Angeles came in at 93 and San Francisco at 45, residents of Quartz Hill, a community in the high-desert near Lancaster, used 308 and residents in Granite Bay and Folsom in Sacramento County in August reached 529 and dropped to 384 in September.\n\nFelicia Marcus, chair of the state board, suggested that if low rainfall continues into 2015, the state could require each agency to enact water-budget allocations and/or tiered pricing. Some cities, such as Irvine and Santa Monica, assign homes a water number. Households exceeding allotments face stiff penalties.\n\nA UC Riverside professor of environmental economics said water fines don\u2019t always work.\n\n\u201cMost research finds wealthier households are less responsive to the price (of water),\u201d said Kurt Schwabe. \u201cThey see it as a small expense relative to their overall income.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSouthern California residents worried about the drought or simply tired of paying high water bills responded in 2014 by claiming 20 million square feet of turf removal rebates, enough to strip 345 football fields, according to the Southern California Water Committee.\n\nChanges in suburban front lawns are slow but increasing, as cities and water agencies pay $2 to $4 per square foot to replace grass with a combination of drought-tolerant plants, rocks and decomposed granite.\n\nManning compared turf removal in Southern California to watching your children grow up. It\u2019s not noticeable you look over time.\n\n\u201cYou are seeing people making front and backyards more California friendly. In 50 years we will look more like Phoenix or Las Vegas,\u201d Manning said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "California\u2019s prolonged drought left an indelible mark on state water policy and homeowners alike in 2014.For the first time in the raucous history of water in California, regulation of", "title": "Drought brought permanent changes to California water policy in 2014", "og": {"url": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/general-news/20141227/drought-brought-permanent-changes-to-california-water-policy-in-2014", "image": {"width": "1500px", "identifier": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LC/20141227/NEWS/141229595/AR/0/AR-141229595.jpg?Maxh=1500&Maxw=1500", "height": "1000px"}, "type": "article", "title": "Drought brought permanent changes to California water policy in 2014"}, "twitter": {"domain": "sgvtribune.com", "description": "California\u2019s prolonged drought left an indelible mark on state water policy and homeowners alike in 2014.For the first time in the raucous history of water in California, regulation of", "title": "Drought brought permanent changes to California water policy in 2014", "url": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/general-news/20141227/drought-brought-permanent-changes-to-california-water-policy-in-2014", "image": {"src": "http://www.sgvtribune.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/LC/20141227/NEWS/141229595/AR/0/AR-141229595.jpg?Maxh=900&Maxw=900"}, "site": "@SGVTribune", "app": {"id": {"ipad": "id551759403", "iphone": "id503025528", "googleplay": "com.spreedinc.providers.digitalfirstmedia.sangabrielvalleytribune"}}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "keywords": "California Drought,Year in Review 2014, Droughts", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "California Drought,Year in Review 2014, Droughts"}, "article_summary": "Likewise, 2014 saw the state water board demand water conservation plans from 400 water agencies.\nFile/Watchara Phomicinda/Staff PhotographerCalifornia\u2019s prolonged drought left an indelible mark on state water policy and homeowners alike in 2014.\nThe new law is a sea change in state water policy, he said.\nManning compared turf removal in Southern California to watching your children grow up.\nSouthern California is in the third year of drought."}
