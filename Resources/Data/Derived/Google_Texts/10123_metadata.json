Terry McAuliffe speaks during an AP Day at the Capitol session in Richmond. (Steve Helber/AP)\n\nGov. Terry McAuliffe would boost financial aid for college students and study a new way of handling campus sexual assaults under a budget plan unveiled Wednesday.\n\nMcAuliffe (D), who has been rolling out portions of the two-year, $100 billion state spending plan that he will propose in full Thursday, gave a preview of his higher education proposal at a Richmond area community college.\n\nHe called for an extra $48 million in financial aid for undergraduates. He also proposed spending $100,000 to study whether the state should take campus sexual assault investigations out of the hands of college officials. The money would be used to fund a study on establishing an independent center to investigate and adjudicate criminal sexual assaults.\n\nMcAuliffe has focused much of his governorship on expanding and diversifying Virginia\u2019s defense-heavy economy. He often speaks of a shortage of skilled workers in certain fields, such as cybersecurity and engineering. He billed his higher education plan as a way to prepare students for what he calls the \u201cnew Virginia economy.\u201d\n\n[McAuliffe calls for $2.4 billion bond package]\n\n\u201cThe biennial budget I will introduce this week will make significant investments in Virginia\u2019s higher education system and steer those institutions toward preparing students to lead in the 21st-century economy,\u201d he told an audience at J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College.\n\nRepublicans, who control the Virginia Senate and House, reacted coolly to McAuliffe\u2019s higher education plan \u2014 as they have to all of his other budget proposals he has revealed so far. They said they anticipate that the governor\u2019s budget plan will be premised on expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, with McAuliffe relying on projected savings from expansion to bankroll new spending and a corporate tax cut.\n\nRepublican legislative leaders are fiercely opposed to Medicaid expansion, which would provide health care to 400,000 uninsured Virginians but also increase the state\u2019s dependence on federal spending.\n\n\u201cThe Governor has certainly raised expectations, but I would caution against putting too much stock in these announcements,\u201d Del. S. Chris Jones (R-Suffolk), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said in a written statement. \u201cI fully expect a number of his proposed initiatives will be predicated on assumptions related to Medicaid expansion, to which the General Assembly clearly remains opposed. I\u2019ve discouraged the Governor from doing this because we are most productive when we set that issue aside and focus on the budget alone.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe\u2019s proposal got a better reception from Virginia21, a nonpartisan group that advocates for issues important to young voters.\n\n\u201cVirginia21 commends the Governor for taking this positive step towards a future where an affordable, high-quality education after high school is a reality for all Virginians,\u201d Jared Calfee, the group\u2019s executive director, said in a written statement. \u201cWe look forward to working with the leadership in the General Assembly to ensure that this critical funding is preserved in the final budget.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe has not explicitly said that his budget, which will hit the $100 billion mark for the first time in state history, will call for Medicaid expansion. While speaking to reporters after his announcement, the governor was asked what he would have to cut from his budget plan if Medicaid is not expanded.\n\n\u201cThe good news is, we have a lot money to spend,\u201d McAuliffe said, noting rising tax receipts and declining unemployment rate. \u201cIt\u2019s a conservative budget. However, we are in good shape.\u201d\n\nMcAuliffe, who was accompanied by Secretary of Commerce and Trade Maurice Jones and Secretary of Education Anne Holton, also announced several other initiatives, including:\n\n\u25cf $50 million in incentives for colleges to educate and graduate more in-state and underrepresented students.\n\n\u25cf $2 million to increase tuition assistance grants to undergraduate students attending independent colleges.\n\n\u25cf $8 million to establish an online degree completion program for adult and other non-traditional students.\n\n\u25cf $24.6 million for community college credentialing programs to increase the number of students receiving certifications in high-demand fields.\n\n\u25cf $25.7 million to provide higher education faculty and staff the same 2 percent raise the governor has proposed for other state employees.\n\n\u25cf $40 million for one-time incentive packages to help retain high-performing researchers and to establish \u201ccenters of excellence\u201d where researchers can collaborate.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The governor also includes funds to study taking college sexual assaults out of the hands of campus officials.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "The governor also includes funds to study taking college sexual assaults out of the hands of campus officials.", "title": "McAuliffe calls for $48M boost in state spending on college financial aid", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/mcauliffe-calls-for-48m-boost-in-state-spending-on-college-financial-aid/2015/12/15/c85f4038-a33e-11e5-9c4e-be37f66848bb_story.html", "image": "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/12/04/Editorial-Opinion/Images/McAuliffe-07acf-625.jpg", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@LVozzella"}, "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/laura.vozzella"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "eomportal-uuid": "c85f4038-a33e-11e5-9c4e-be37f66848bb"}, "article_summary": "Terry McAuliffe would boost financial aid for college students and study a new way of handling campus sexual assaults under a budget plan unveiled Wednesday.\n\u25cf $25.7 million to provide higher education faculty and staff the same 2 percent raise the governor has proposed for other state employees.\nHe also proposed spending $100,000 to study whether the state should take campus sexual assault investigations out of the hands of college officials.\nMcAuliffe (D), who has been rolling out portions of the two-year, $100 billion state spending plan that he will propose in full Thursday, gave a preview of his higher education proposal at a Richmond area community college.\nRepublicans, who control the Virginia Senate and House, reacted coolly to McAuliffe\u2019s higher education plan \u2014 as they have to all of his other budget proposals he has revealed so far."}
