Gary Odom, D-Nashville, wants you to pay an additional 44-cent tax on each pack of cigarettes to help fund Medicaid expansion.\n\nAre you willing to pay the extra tax, or might you drive across state lines to light up?\n\nThis proposed tax is on top of the 62 cents a pack you\u2019re currently paying, according to his newly proposed legislation. That\u2019s on top of $1.01 in federal taxes per pack.\n\n\n\nOdom believes the extra tax revenue will bring in an extra $175 million a year, which will go to expand TennCare, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid, under Obamacare.\n\nJustin Owen, president of the Nashville-based Beacon Center, a free-market think tank, believes the plan is nonsensical.\n\n\u201cNow we want to raise taxes even more and try to fund a program that is, in itself, unsustainable? It doesn\u2019t really make fiscal sense,\u201d Owen said. \u201cBecause Tennessee is situated geographically the way that it is, everyone is within an hour and a half at most from another state.\u201d\n\nEight states border Tennessee, and most of them have lower cigarette taxes. Only Arkansas and Mississippi charge more.\n\n\u201cSo it would be very easy for people to go buy cigarettes in other states and pay their taxes and leave us with a deficit to pay for the expansion of a Medicaid program that we just can\u2019t afford,\u201d Owen told Tennessee Watchdog.\n\nOdom didn\u2019t respond to Tennessee Watchdog\u2019s messages requesting comment before publication time.\n\nHe told Gannett newspapers, however, the money is \u201cmore than enough to offset the state\u2019s eventual share of TennCare expansion, while also taking aim at the harmful effects of smoking.\u201d\n\n\n\nOwen told Tennessee Watchdog that Odom\u2019s proposal, in that context, makes little sense.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s illogical to raise taxes to pay for something while also pushing to get less of what you\u2019re taxing. You\u2019re certainly going to wind up in a fiscal trap,\u201d Owen said.\n\nAccording to the Federation of Tax Administrators, Tennessee currently has the 12th lowest cigarette tax in the nation.\n\n\n\nThe Republican-led General Assembly is skeptical of plans to expand TennCare under Obamacare. Many legislators say they worry about the extra money they would eventually have to start paying at the state level, which Gannett reports as $170 million per year.\n\nThe eight states that border Tennessee currently charge the following cigarette taxes:\n\nAlabama : 42.5 cents a pack\n\n: 42.5 cents a pack Arkansas: 115 cents per pack\n\nGeorgia : 37 cents per pack\n\n: 37 cents per pack Kentucky : 60 cents a pack\n\n: 60 cents a pack Mississippi 68 cents a pack\n\nMissouri : 17 cents a pack\n\n: 17 cents a pack North Carolina : 45 cents a pack\n\n: 45 cents a pack Virginia: 30 cents a pack.\n\nEven if Tennessee lawmakers were to increase the cigarette tax, it would still fall below the national average among states of $1.53 per pack. Connecticut, for instance, charges a tax of $3.40 per pack, while New York State charges $4.35.\n\nThe highest combined state-local tax rate is $6.16 in Chicago, with New York City second at $5.85 per pack, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.\n\n\u201cPeople will get cigarettes the cheapest way they possibly can,\u201d Owen said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a significant black market for cigarettes. By raising taxes, particularly significantly above what other bordering states are situated at, you\u2019re going to end up driving up that black market and that just means more problems for law enforcement and fewer tax revenues for the state.\u201d\n\nContact Christopher Butler at chris@tennesseewatchdog.org. or follow him and submit story ideas on his official Facebook page.\n\nGet regular Tennessee Watchdog updates through our Facebook or Twitter accounts\n\nLike Watchdog.org?
