COLORADO SPRINGS —The Broadmoor hotel has agreed to buy the Norris-Penrose Event Center, the latest in a series of acquisitions and alliances that link the five-star Colorado Springs resort to signature attractions and venues in the Pikes Peak region.

The hotel has signed a letter of intent with the nonprofit Pikes Peak or Bust Rodeo Foundation, which has owned and operated the Norris-Penrose facility on the city’s west side since 2005, said Broadmoor President and CEO Steve Bartolin and Scott Bryan, the foundation’s board president and head of a local construction company.

Neither would disclose the purchase price.

The Broadmoor has begun a due diligence period and expects to finalize its purchase in 60 days, Bartolin said Wednesday.

The purchase would include all of the facilities that make up Norris-Penrose, which sits on 73 acres at 1045 Lower Gold Camp Road. The name of the facility will remained unchanged, Bartolin said.

According to the venue’s website, Norris-Penrose features an outdoor stadium with 5,700 seats that’s playing host this week to the foundation’s marquee event: the Pikes Peak or Bust Rodeo, which runs through Saturday. The stadium also can seat 4,300 more for concerts.
