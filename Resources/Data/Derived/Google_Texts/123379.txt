Judge Angela Stokes' behavior was 'downright despicable' and she led a 'reign of terror,' says lawyer for Ohio Supreme Court

Lawyers for the Ohio Supreme Court's disciplinary arm argued today that Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Angela Stokes' treatment of people appearing in her courtroom was "downright despicable" and that she led a "reign of terror" that disrupted the entire court.

Stokes is on trial before the Ohio Supreme Court's Board of Professional Conduct, which began a trial-like hearing today to consider charges filed against Stokes in 2013 by the court's disciplinary counsel.

"Evidence will show that when any person walked into the courtroom, they walked into a different universe," Joseph Caligiuri, an attorney for the disciplinary counsel, said during opening statements.

He then played a 10-minute reel of video clips of Stokes admonishing staff, defendants and lawyers during court, including several instances where she told people to "shut up." | Read Mark Naymik's story
