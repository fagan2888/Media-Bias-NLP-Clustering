Police said they are investigating a metro school bus driver after he crashed into multiple cars before slamming into a railroad bridge. Thankfully, no children were on the bus, but instead drugs were found.

Police said 58-year-old Mid-Del Schools bus driver Odis Pitts, who was on his way to pick up students, weaved in and out of traffic along S.E. 15th Street from I-35 to Santa Fe Avenue.

The bus swerved and caused four separate car accidents.

Investigators said it doesn't appear that Pitts was speeding.

"I looked at it again and said, â€˜Oh, I don't think somebody made it out of this one, that just looks too bad to me,'" said Jessie Briggs, who lives near the crash site.

"When I came out, I saw the truck flip up, car up against the curb, and I had never seen anything on the street like this before."

Several people were hurt. One person suffered a serious neck injury and another may have to have a hand amputated.

"I am amazed that we don't have more serious injuries, you take 8 o'clock in the morning on a school day, and you got a school bus driving down the street in that type of condition, and a school bus is a big vehicle and carries a lot of mass behind it," said Oklahoma City Police Lt. Rod Strecker.

Police said Pitts had some type of medical emergency before ultimately slamming into a railroad bridge, where they found him unconscious.

Detectives also discovered drugs on the school bus. Pitts was arrested on complaints of Driving under the Influence and Leaving the Scene of an Injury Accident. He will stay in the hospital overnight before being booked into jail.

The Mid-Del School district said the bus was impounded by police, but it did have a surveillance camera. Pitts had been a Mid-Del bus driver since 2011.
