Former top political advisor David Axelrod took a pounding Sunday over why he didn’t stop the president from making promises to the American people about Obamacare that he would never be able to keep.

On “Meet the Press,” both NBC’s David Gregory and journalist Bob Woodward assailed Axelrod, whose job it was to advise the president, over why he allowed Obama to promise Americans they could keep their healthcare plan if they liked it.

“This is about political practice and leadership…you were in the White House, you were advising the president on the kinds of things he should say. Why did not you or somebody else say to him, ‘Mr. President, don’t say no matter what you’re going to keep your healthcare plan?’” Gregory demanded of Axelrod, emphasizing his serious point by slapping his hand on the table.

“Hindsight is 20/20,” Axelrod answered. “For the vast majority of Americans, that statement will hold true for. For this small group of Americans, it hasn’t. The calamitous thing here is that the website wasn’t up. Because many of those people who have to transition are going to get better insurance for less money, but they just can’t tell that now.”

Shockingly, Axelrod agreed with Woodward that Obama should have been “straightforward” with the American people, but said, “I don’t think there’s any shame in saying we didn’t anticipate this one glitch, we grandfathered a lot of policies, we didn’t anticipate this one glitch.”
