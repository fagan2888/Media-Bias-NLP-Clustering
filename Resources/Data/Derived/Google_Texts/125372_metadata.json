David Balmer said he worried that the exchange may have been operating on a use-it-or-lose-it basis.\n\n\u201cI am profoundly concerned that there may have been an attitude at Connect for Health Colorado that this early influx of tax dollars was money from the federal government and that the exchange felt they needed to spend quickly before it ran out,\u201d Mr. Balmer told Health News Colorado.\n\nColorado is one of 14 states and the District of Columbia that operates its own state-based health-care exchange under the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWe found that Connect for Health Colorado has not sufficiently ensured that public funds have been spent in accordance with federal requirements, that staff follow internal financial and accounting policies and procedures consistently, and that financial controls adequately safeguard its resources as its last federal grant enters its final stage and the organization moves to become self-sustaining,\u201d said the 92-page report.\n\nThe audit found problems with 35 of the exchange\u2019s 92 vendors, including a number of contractors that had been paid out of compliance with their contracts. For example, 25 of the 141 contractors were paid a total of $10.5 million more than agreed upon in their contracts. One vendor received $128,798 before signing a contract.\n\nAnother problem flagged by the audit was a $38,344 payment to a vendor for 100,000 tubes of lip balm to promote the exchange. The audit said such promotional activity is expressly prohibited under the ACA.\n\nOne contractor was paid $175 per hour for a total of $1.7 million for IT support that the audit says could have been performed by staff. The audit also found numerous instances of payments made to vendors without proper receipts or support.\n\nThe state audit was described as a \u201climited performance audit.\u201d Republican legislators had fought to pass a bill earlier this year for a comprehensive audit, but Democrats killed the measure in the state Senate, which was controlled by Democrats.\n\nRepublicans, who won a one-member majority in the state Senate in November, have vowed to bring another bill to conduct a thorough audit when the legislative session begins in January.\n\n\u201cSadly, I am not surprised,\u201d said Republican state Sen. Dan Nordberg, who sponsored the audit bill. \u201cI have had ongoing concerns about how Connect for Health Colorado was managing taxpayers\u2019 funds, which is why I pushed so hard last year to expand the auditor\u2019s oversight of this organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope Democrats will see the light and support my efforts this year to give the state auditor\u2019s office the authority it needs to expose this kind of government waste and help us better protect taxpayer funds,\u201d Mr. Nordberg said in a statement.\n\nConnect for Health Colorado, which has spent $136.5 million, is required to be financially self-sustaining by January, but has requested an extension in order to spend the remainder of the $177 million in federal grants.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A devastating state audit released Monday found a rash of problems with the Colorado health-care exchange's handling of $32 million in taxpayer funds as well as possible violations of federal law.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "A devastating state audit released Monday found a rash of problems with the Colorado health-care exchange\u2019s handling of $32 million in taxpayer funds as well as possible violations of federal law.", "title": "Scathing audit says Colorado\u2019s Obamacare exchange mismanaged taxpayer funds", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/dec/8/scathing-audit-says-colorados-obamacare-exchange-m/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/31/health-overhaul-coloradojpeg-007dd.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/03/31/health-overhaul-coloradojpeg-007dd.jpg", "description": "A devastating state audit released Monday found a rash of problems with the Colorado health-care exchange's handling of $32 million in taxpayer funds as well as possible violations of federal law.", "card": "summary", "title": "Scathing audit says Colorado\u2019s Obamacare exchange mismanaged tax"}, "Author": "Valerie Richardson", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Health Medical Pharma, Politics"}, "article_summary": "The state audit was described as a \u201climited performance audit.\u201d Republican legislators had fought to pass a bill earlier this year for a comprehensive audit, but Democrats killed the measure in the state Senate, which was controlled by Democrats.\nDENVER \u2014 A devastating state audit released Monday found a rash of problems with the Colorado health-care exchange\u2019s handling of $32 million in taxpayer funds as well as possible violations of federal law.\nRepublican state Sen.
