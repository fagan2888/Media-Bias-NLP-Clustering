But don\u2019t worry, Jon Stewart and company came out swinging when they finally got their chance on Monday evening.\n\nStewart started by railing against the failure to competently roll out Obamacare via HealthCare.gov. This is something he touched on before the show\u2019s hiatus, but given an additional week to seethe and more information on the tech disaster, he was able to give the humiliating situation a just and proper shaming.\n\nShare This Video Facebook Twitter EMAIL\n\nJon saved plenty of rage for the President\u2019s reaction to the breakdown. His undressing of yesterday\u2019s bizarre press conference and photo op aimed at calming the masses is just as spirited, and it contains a fantastic Simpsons reference.\n\nShare This Video Facebook Twitter EMAIL\n\nThe mockery continued when Stewart checked in on John Oliver\u2019s attempt to access HealthCare.gov, only to find he\u2019d been sucked into a Tron-like cyber-bureaucratic nightmare.\n\nShare This Video Facebook Twitter EMAIL\n\nThe Daily Show", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obamacare website continues to have problems, and Jon Stewart and 'The Daily Show' aren't giving the administration a free pass.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Jon Stewart Ripped Apart The Obamacare Rollout On \u2018The Daily Show\u2019\",\"link\":\"http:\\/\\/www.uproxx.com\\/tv\\/jon-stewart-ripped-apart-obamacare-rollout-daily-show\\/\",\"image_url\":\"https:\\/\\/uproxx.files.wordpress.com\\/2013\\/10\\/18.jpg?quality=90&w=650\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"UP-366046\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-10-22T13:01:39Z\",\"author\":\"Ryan Perry\",\"section\":\"TV\"}", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "site": "@UPROXX", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@UPROXX"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News and Culture for the Digital Generation", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\": \"story\"}", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1109605093", "fb": {"admins": "680207693,2208604", "page_id": 116548701336, "app_id": 117400151618132}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://uproxx.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/bae760df0e3bd64e122a0b36facaee58?s=16", "application-name": "UPROXX", "google-site-verification": "370ZQZwYhpp3OFLpudIZ11ONRN8X1ZhGglPMAFJ6GKw", "keywords": "the obamacare website continues to have problems, and jon stewart and 'the daily show' aren't giving the administration a free pass.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UPROXX", "published_time": "2013-10-22T13:01:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-22T13:01:39+00:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "UPROXX", "description": "Jon Stewart and company were finally able to address the Obamacare rollout disaster, and they came out swinging.", "title": "Jon Stewart Ripped Apart The Obamacare Rollout On \u2018The Daily Show\u2019", "url": "http://www.uproxx.com/tv/jon-stewart-ripped-apart-obamacare-rollout-daily-show/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://uproxx.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/18.jpg?quality=90&w=650", "height": 365}, "locale": "en_GB", "type": "article"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "The Obamacare website continues to have problems, and Jon Stewart and 'The Daily Show' aren't giving the administration a free pass."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd89bc\"", "article_summary": "Share This Video Facebook Twitter EMAILThe Daily Show\nShare This Video Facebook Twitter EMAILJon saved plenty of rage for the President\u2019s reaction to the breakdown.\nBut don\u2019t worry, Jon Stewart and company came out swinging when they finally got their chance on Monday evening.\nStewart started by railing against the failure to competently roll out Obamacare via HealthCare.gov.\nThe Daily Show scheduled one hell of a week to be on hiatus, what with last week\u2019s government shutdown developments and the continuing Obamacare website difficulties."}
