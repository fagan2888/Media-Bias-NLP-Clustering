It\u2019s usu\u00adally fol\u00adlowed by these kinds of qual\u00adi\u00adfi\u00aders:\n\n\u201d \u201c\u00a6 Amer\u00adica is still im\u00adport\u00ading a lot of oil.\u201d\n\n\u201d \u201c\u00a6 we should ex\u00adport more value-ad\u00added products, like those re\u00adfined from crude oil.\u201d\n\n\u201d \u201c\u00a6 this is\u00adsue is a lot more com\u00adplic\u00adated than you\u2019re mak\u00ading it seem!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s polit\u00adic\u00adally tricky for a Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adan, whose party by prin\u00adciple rep\u00adres\u00adents free mar\u00adkets, free trade, and small gov\u00adern\u00adment, to op\u00adpose lift\u00ading a fed\u00ader\u00adally im\u00adposed ban on ex\u00adport\u00ading a product. (Demo\u00adcrats, whose party em\u00adbraces lar\u00adger gov\u00adern\u00adment, get a more of a free pass on this.)\n\nThat makes it all the more in\u00adter\u00adest\u00ading that a hand\u00adful of key House Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans are sur\u00adpris\u00adingly cau\u00adtious about lift\u00ading the ban on crude-oil ex\u00adports, which Con\u00adgress put in place in the af\u00adter\u00admath of the 1973 oil em\u00adbargo by Middle East\u00adern pro\u00addu\u00adcers.\n\n\u201cFor us to be in\u00adtro\u00addu\u00adcing le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion to al\u00adlow the ex\u00adports right now might be a little bit pre\u00adma\u00adture,\u201d House En\u00adergy and Power Sub\u00adcom\u00admit\u00adtee Chair\u00adman Ed Whit\u00adfield, R-Ky., said in an in\u00adter\u00adview Thursday. \u201cI think we need to let this whole thing play out.\u201d\n\nLe\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion aside, he did not say wheth\u00ader he would sup\u00adport lift\u00ading the ban, as Sen\u00adate En\u00adergy and Nat\u00adur\u00adal Re\u00adsources rank\u00ading mem\u00adber Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, did in a speech last week.\n\nIn\u00adstead, Whit\u00adfield went in\u00adto a lengthy de\u00adscrip\u00adtion of how the is\u00adsue is more com\u00adplex than simply pro\u00addu\u00adcing a lot more oil than the coun\u00adtry has in dec\u00adades. He said oil com\u00ading out of North Dakota\u2019s vast Bakken field is a dif\u00adfer\u00adent type of oil than the type the coun\u00adtry\u2019s main re\u00adfinery hub along the Gulf Coast is equipped to pro\u00adcess. He men\u00adtioned the Jones Act, which re\u00adquires all goods \u2014 in\u00adclud\u00ading en\u00adergy products \u2014 that are shipped in U.S. wa\u00adters from one part of the coun\u00adtry to an\u00adoth\u00ader to be trans\u00adpor\u00adted on a ves\u00adsel built in the U.S. Lastly, he made an ar\u00adgu\u00adment that will res\u00adon\u00adate across parties and the coun\u00adtry:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still im\u00adport\u00ading oil,\u201d Whit\u00adfield said.\n\nThe coun\u00adtry is im\u00adport\u00ading about 40 per\u00adcent of its pet\u00adro\u00adleum, which is the low\u00adest amount since 1991, ac\u00adcord\u00ading to the En\u00adergy In\u00adform\u00ada\u00adtion Ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion, but that\u2019s still a large per\u00adcent\u00adage. EIA pre\u00addicts that num\u00adber could drop even lower to 28 per\u00adcent in years to come giv\u00aden Amer\u00adica\u2019s oil boom.\n\nWhit\u00adfield\u2019s com\u00adments are sim\u00adil\u00adar to those made Fri\u00adday by Rep. Doug Lam\u00adborn, R-Colo., who chairs the En\u00adergy and Min\u00ader\u00adal Re\u00adsources Sub\u00adcom\u00admit\u00adtee of the House Nat\u00adur\u00adal Re\u00adsources Com\u00admit\u00adtee. He used the crude-oil ex\u00adport ban as an op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adity to cri\u00adti\u00adcize the Obama ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion for not al\u00adlow\u00ading more drilling in the Gulf of Mex\u00adico. He fi\u00adnally ar\u00adrived at his rather small an\u00adswer to this big de\u00adbate.\n\n\u201cAs long as 85 per\u00adcent of our out\u00ader con\u00adtin\u00adent\u00adal shelf re\u00admains closed by this ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion, as long as less than 2 per\u00adcent of our fed\u00ader\u00adal on\u00adshore min\u00ader\u00adal es\u00adtate is avail\u00adable for leas\u00ading, as long as this ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion drives out re\u00adsource de\u00advel\u00adop\u00adment on new sources of en\u00adergy like do\u00admest\u00adic oil shale, those dis\u00adcus\u00adsions are pre\u00adma\u00adture,\u201d Lam\u00adborn said at a hear\u00ading on do\u00admest\u00adic en\u00adergy pro\u00adduc\u00adtion Fri\u00adday.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear, I sup\u00adport free trade,\u201d Lam\u00adborn stressed. \u201cI also sup\u00adport Amer\u00adic\u00adan en\u00adergy in\u00adde\u00adpend\u00adence and that is a road we are on but we are still far from our goal.\u201d\n\nEven the most com\u00admit\u00adted free-mar\u00adketers real\u00adize Wash\u00ading\u00adton will not look on this de\u00adbate lightly. Old memor\u00adies die hard, and politi\u00adcians of all parties are also ter\u00adri\u00adfied that lift\u00ading the ban could raise gas\u00adol\u00adine prices, or at least be por\u00adtrayed that way on the cam\u00adpaign trail.\n\n\u201cThe jit\u00adters about en\u00adergy in\u00adde\u00adpend\u00adence are shared by House mem\u00adbers as well as the gen\u00ader\u00adal pub\u00adlic,\u201d said Marlo Lewis, a seni\u00ador fel\u00adlow at the Com\u00adpet\u00adit\u00adive En\u00adter\u00adprise In\u00adsti\u00adtute, a con\u00adser\u00advat\u00adive, liber\u00adtari\u00adan think tank. \u201cThere are a lot of people who still look at these is\u00adsues through the memor\u00adies of the 1970s, and that\u2019s a polit\u00adic\u00adal real\u00adity.\u201d\n\nEn\u00advir\u00adon\u00adment and Eco\u00adnomy Sub\u00adcom\u00admit\u00adtee Chair\u00adman John Shimkus, R-Ill., has a more nu\u00adanced an\u00adswer. He first de\u00adscribed how all com\u00admod\u00adit\u00adies, ran\u00adging from corn to beans to nat\u00adur\u00adal gas, should be ex\u00adpor\u00adted without re\u00adstric\u00adtions. Then, he fi\u00adnally ar\u00adrived as his (sort of) an\u00adswer:\n\n\u201cPub\u00adlic-policy-wise, if you want to be con\u00adsist\u00adent, crude oil is a bulk com\u00admod\u00adity and you should be able to ex\u00adport it,\u201d Shimkus said in an in\u00adter\u00adview last week. But, then the caveat comes: \u201cI would rather the crude go to U.S. re\u00adfiner\u00adies to get re\u00adfined and then ex\u00adport the re\u00adfined product be\u00adcause we get double, triple the money.\u201d\n\nThese Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans and most oth\u00ader people in Wash\u00ading\u00adton have been caught a bit flat-footed by this de\u00adbate, which many didn\u2019t ex\u00adpect to come in\u00adto the spot\u00adlight as quickly as it has.\n\nThe House En\u00adergy and Com\u00admerce Com\u00admit\u00adtee is gear\u00ading up to re\u00adlease a re\u00adport on the geo\u00adpol\u00adit\u00adic\u00adal be\u00adne\u00adfits of ex\u00adport\u00ading nat\u00adur\u00adal gas, a top\u00adic that Wash\u00ading\u00adton delved in\u00adto last year. Now, the ex\u00adport de\u00adbate is passing the com\u00admit\u00adtee by, at least for the time be\u00ading.\n\n\u201cGive us a little while. We\u2019re in the midst of do\u00ading some ana\u00adlys\u00adis,\u201d Com\u00admit\u00adtee Chair\u00adman Fred Up\u00adton, R-Mich., told En\u00advir\u00adon\u00adment & En\u00adergy Daily last week.\n\nIn\u00addeed, this de\u00adbate is still in its in\u00adfancy, and politi\u00adcians will surely evolve (polit\u00adic\u00adal eu\u00adphem\u00adism for \u201cchange\u201d) their po\u00ads\u00adi\u00adtions over the next year or more. In fact, Shimkus did once say that with nat\u00adur\u00adal-gas ex\u00adports, he came around to the idea of sup\u00adport\u00ading that policy change.\n\nBut nat\u00adur\u00adal gas doesn\u2019t af\u00adfect gas\u00adol\u00adine prices. And that\u2019s why this de\u00adbate is dif\u00adfer\u00adent \u2014 and tough\u00ader \u2014 for Re\u00adpub\u00adlic\u00adans (and, less so, for Demo\u00adcrats).\n\n\u201cTo call for the re\u00admov\u00adal of the crude-oil ex\u00adport ban, even if a lot of people don\u2019t know about it, once they hear about it, it can take on the char\u00adac\u00adter of the sac\u00adred cow,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI don\u2019t think any\u00adthing hav\u00ading to do with nat\u00adur\u00adal gas and ex\u00adport does.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "National Journal", "description": "Republicans and free-traders are conflicted about lifting the crude-oil export ban.", "title": "When Conservatism Collides With America\u2019s Oil Boom", "url": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/2014/01/12/when-conservatism-collides-with-americas-oil-boom", "image": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2014/01/10/81436085.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "mxRH-jX1pR5MjoxIjXJOxnDElPR-loQvW49hc6LMh6w", "twitter": {"site": "@nationaljournal", "image": {"src": "https://www.nationaljournal.com/media/media/2014/01/10/81436085.jpg"}, "description": "Republicans and free-traders are conflicted about lifting the crude-oil export ban.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "When Conservatism Collides With America\u2019s Oil Boom"}, "description": "Republicans and free-traders are conflicted about lifting the crude-oil export ban.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9cc8\"", "article_summary": "EIA pre\u00addicts that num\u00adber could drop even lower to 28 per\u00adcent in years to come giv\u00aden Amer\u00adica\u2019s oil boom.\nHe used the crude-oil ex\u00adport ban as an op\u00adpor\u00adtun\u00adity to cri\u00adti\u00adcize the Obama ad\u00admin\u00adis\u00adtra\u00adtion for not al\u00adlow\u00ading more drilling in the Gulf of Mex\u00adico.\nNow, the ex\u00adport de\u00adbate is passing the com\u00admit\u00adtee by, at least for the time be\u00ading.\n\u201cFor us to be in\u00adtro\u00addu\u00adcing le\u00adgis\u00adla\u00adtion to al\u00adlow the ex\u00adports right now might be a little bit pre\u00adma\u00adture,\u201d House En\u00adergy and Power Sub\u00adcom\u00admit\u00adtee Chair\u00adman Ed Whit\u00adfield, R-Ky., said in an in\u00adter\u00adview Thursday.\nIn\u00adstead, Whit\u00adfield went in\u00adto a lengthy de\u00adscrip\u00adtion of how the is\u00adsue is more com\u00adplex than simply pro\u00addu\u00adcing a lot more oil than the coun\u00adtry has in dec\u00adades."}
