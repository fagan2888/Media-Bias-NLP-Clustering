But the medical bills kept piling up.\n\n\"It was scary,\" he recalls.\n\nLast year, his wife, who stays at home with their special-needs son, started looking into coverage from the federal marketplace at HealthCare.gov.\n\nThey found a Coventry Health Care of the Carolinas plan that, with subsidies, cost the family $24 a month.\n\n\"Finally, we went and enrolled,\" he said. \"I hate to say it was a godsend, but it has met all of our medical needs and for a much lower cost than what we expected.\"\n\nThe family has already re-enrolled for 2015, and their plan now costs only 24 cents a month.\n\nAlthough they still have to pay off their debts, Jeter said the coverage helps with prescriptions and doctor visits, and his previous conditions don't affect his ability to have health insurance.\n\n\"I don't know how we'd be able to make it without 'Obamacare,'\" he said.\n\nMore than 458,000 North Carolinians, including 65,000 in the Triangle, have already enrolled for 2015 through HealthCare.gov, and officials say 92 percent have qualified for financial help to lower the cost of their monthly premiums.\n\nThe deadline is Feb. 15. Those who don't obtain insurance by then \u2013 or who don't have coverage through their employer \u2013 face a tax penalty of $325 or 2 percent of annual income, whichever is greater, next year.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.wral.com/rss/48&id=5;cycle=1", "dcterms.created": "2015-01-22 14:43:00", "description": "With the 2015 deadline to enroll for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act approaching, one Raleigh family is spreading the word to get people signed up.", "application-name": "WRAL.com", "dcterms.modified": "2015-01-22 18:25:26", "outbrain": {"ob_desc": "id_asset=14378872|asset_type=story"}, "twitter": {"description": "With the 2015 deadline to enroll for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act approaching, one Raleigh family is spreading the word to get people signed up.", "title": "Raleigh family gets insurance for less than penny a day under health law :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/raleigh-family-gets-insurance-for-less-than-penny-a-day-under-health-law/14378872/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/healthteam/2015/01/22/14380237/14380238-1421969120-160x120.jpg", "site": "@wral", "card": "summary"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#041E30", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "robots": "index,follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"app_id": 334167666672300}, "author": "WRAL", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-22T14:43:00-05:00"}, "og": {"site_name": "WRAL.com", "description": "With the 2015 deadline to enroll for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act approaching, one Raleigh family is spreading the word to get people signed up.", "title": "Raleigh family gets insurance for less than penny a day under health law :: WRAL.com", "url": "http://www.wral.com/raleigh-family-gets-insurance-for-less-than-penny-a-day-under-health-law/14378872/", "image": "http://wwwcache.wral.com/asset/lifestyles/healthteam/2015/01/22/14380237/165391-renee4pm-960x540.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "pinterest": "nohover", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0121\"", "article_summary": "Glenn Jeter used to work at IBM, but he lost his job \u2013 and his employer-sponsored health insurance \u2013 two years ago.\n\"As luck would have it, the only time I've ever been hospitalized in my life was after I found myself without insurance,\" Jeter said.\nThey found a Coventry Health Care of the Carolinas plan that, with subsidies, cost the family $24 a month.\nAlthough they still have to pay off their debts, Jeter said the coverage helps with prescriptions and doctor visits, and his previous conditions don't affect his ability to have health insurance.\nThe family has already re-enrolled for 2015, and their plan now costs only 24 cents a month."}
