Literally, the word means \u201cblown out\u201d and evokes the image of a candle\u2019s flame, Encyclopedia Britannica explains. When applied to headphones, a new spelling of the same word may soon mean \u201cblissed out.\u201d\n\nNervana headphones deliver electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve with the beat of the music. Wearing these headphones, users feel their music \u2014 a tingling sensation in their ear \u2014 accompanied by waves of calm, relaxation, and relief in some cases.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like there\u2019s another layer to the music,\u201d one woman said after trying the headphones on The Doctors.\n\n\u201cI just kind of feel chill now,\u201d said another user.\n\nThe pair of doctor brothers who devised the new technology say the headphones work by electrically stimulating a user\u2019s vagus nerve. This in turn triggers a surge of the pleasure-producing neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. Co-creators Richard and Daniel Cartledge say they\u2019ve tested their product on hundreds of people, and proven it to be both safe and natural feeling.\n\nWhat is the Vagus Nerve?\n\nOn each side of your body, a vagus nerve runs from your brainstem through your neck to your chest and abdomen. These nerves are the largest of the cranial nerves. Vagus nerve stimulation is a well known therapy commonly used to prevent epileptic seizures. Epilepsy patients receive a surgical implant similar to a pacemaker that sends regular, mild pulses of electrical energy to the brain via the vagus nerve on the left side of the body. (The right vagus nerve conveys nerve impulses to the heart, so it\u2019s not used.) Because the stimulation is much less frequent in these cases, patients are generally unaware the device is operating, and they don\u2019t experience a surge of dopamine. Recently, doctors have begun using vagus nerve stimulation to treat depression in cases where other therapies fail, and scientists are testing the treatment with a variety of conditions ranging from headaches to multiple sclerosis.\n\nThe Nervana device does not require surgery to access the nerve. It is portable, pocket-sized, and compatible with all genres of music, though the headphones require a generator to produce the nerve signals.\n\nNervana device Courtesy of Nervana LLC\n\nA dual jack conducts output signals from both a user\u2019s music device and the generator through the cord to the headphone. While the right earbud receives and plays the right channel of the music signal in high-fidelity sound, the left earbud receives and plays the left channel of the music signal at the same time as it delivers electrical stimulation to the inside surface of the ear canal. This stimulates the Vagus nerve.\n\nThe generator has three modes: Music, Ambient, and Formula. The Music mode plays whatever music has been selected while stimulating the vagus nerve. Ambient mode also stimulates the vagus nerve, but replaces music with sounds from a user\u2019s environment. And Formula mode simply stimulates the nerve without any accompanying sound. Users customize the settings to their taste with a sensitivity dial.\n\nThough the headphones are not yet available, you can purchase them by backing the Boca Raton-based company\u2019s project on Indiegogo. The first of many products the brothers are planning to develop, Nervana headphones are expected to ship by June.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "vagus nerve stimulation, dopamine, music, headphones, technology, neuroscience", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Nervana headphones deliver electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve with the beat of the music.", "title": "Music Is Pleasure With These New Headphones", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-headphones-vagus-nerve-dopamine-music-379666", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/28/nervana-earbuds.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nervana headphones deliver electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve with the beat of the music.", "title": "Music Is Pleasure With These New Headphones", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/new-headphones-vagus-nerve-dopamine-music-379666", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/28/nervana-earbuds.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2016/03/28/nervana-earbuds.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2016-03-28T10:14:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-28T10:54:23-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Nervana headphones deliver electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve with the beat of the music."}, "article_summary": "(The right vagus nerve conveys nerve impulses to the heart, so it\u2019s not used.)\nThe pair of doctor brothers who devised the new technology say the headphones work by electrically stimulating a user\u2019s vagus nerve.\nVagus nerve stimulation is a well known therapy commonly used to prevent epileptic seizures.\nOn each side of your body, a vagus nerve runs from your brainstem through your neck to your chest and abdomen.\nWhen applied to headphones, a new spelling of the same word may soon mean \u201cblissed out.\u201dNervana headphones deliver electrical stimulation to the vagus nerve with the beat of the music."}
