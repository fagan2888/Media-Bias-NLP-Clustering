He is also the conflicted architect of Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law.\n\nNow, if he is confirmed, Mr. Baucus, who had already announced that he would not run for re-election in 2014, will join the administration whose bureaucratic ineptitude he foresaw in April when he warned of a \u201chuge train wreck\u201d if officials did not do a better job explaining the Affordable Care Act.\n\nA Democratic official said Mr. Obama settled on Mr. Baucus to succeed Gary Locke, the current ambassador, for reasons that include his efforts to bring down trade barriers between China and the United States and his insistence that \u201cChina play by internationally accepted rules\u201d regarding currency, intellectual property, labor and human rights.\n\nThe senator\u2019s departure would also remove a Democrat who has been a thorn in his party\u2019s side, and would clear the way for Gov. Steve Bullock of Montana to appoint a fellow Democrat, most likely Lt. Gov. John Walsh, as interim senator. Mr. Walsh, who has already declared for Mr. Baucus\u2019s seat, would be a strong candidate next November in a race crucial to the party\u2019s continued control of the chamber.\n\nMr. Baucus, Montana\u2019s longest-serving senator, was also a strong advocate for a tax overhaul, and his leaving is likely to decrease any momentum for that initiative, pleasing Democrats who are unenthusiastic about it. But it is health care, more than any other issue, that has defined Mr. Baucus in recent years.\n\nIn a wide-ranging conversation on the health overhaul in his Capitol Hill office last week, before Wednesday\u2019s news of his impending nomination, Mr. Baucus said he had a \u201cflash of anger\u201d over its bungled rollout. He also said that the law did not do enough to control costs and that Kathleen Sebelius, Mr. Obama\u2019s health secretary, and her top aides delivered only \u201cplatitudes\u201d when he asked them for specifics on how they would carry out the health overhaul.\n\n\u201cThe more I asked,\u201d he said, \u201cthe more concerned I became.\u201d\n\nBut today the law is as much Mr. Baucus\u2019s legacy as Mr. Obama\u2019s. In 2009, it fell to Mr. Baucus to shepherd the health measure through the Senate by dint of his committee chairmanship and the death of the chamber\u2019s leading voice on health care, Edward M. Kennedy. Although he remains a champion, and says Americans will ultimately embrace it, he expects it might take a decade.\n\n\u201cMax has always made some Democrats nervous \u2014 his fateful words about the Obamacare train wreck have turned out to be very true,\u201d said John E. Sununu, the Republican former senator from New Hampshire.\n\nThe act is hugely unpopular in Montana, and some analysts say it could have cost Mr. Baucus, who has been in the Senate 35 years, his re-election in 2014. At 72 and newly remarried, he said last week that he was ready for \u201ca whole new adventure, a whole new chapter.\u201d\n\nHe continues to fret that the health care law had no Republican support in either the Senate or the House. \u201cIt is my belief that for major legislation to be durable, sustainable, it has to be bipartisan,\u201d Mr. Baucus said. \u201cI mean, one party can\u2019t jam legislation down the other party\u2019s throat. It leaves a bitter taste.\u201d\n\nScion of a prominent and mostly Republican Montana ranching family, Mr. Baucus has always been an introvert, unusual for a politician. He is not one for big speeches or the Sunday talk shows \u2014 he stuttered as a child and still struggles with it slightly.\n\nHe settled on a career in public service after \u201can epiphany,\u201d he said, while backpacking in the 1960s in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, during a break from his studies at Stanford University. He eventually graduated, and got a law degree there. One former Baucus chief of staff, Jon Selib, echoed the views of many when he said the senator \u201cmarches to the beat of his own drummer.\u201d\n\nIn 2001 Mr. Baucus defied Tom Daschle, then the Senate Democratic leader, by co-writing President George W. Bush\u2019s tax cuts, setting off screaming matches between the two Democrats. In 2003, Mr. Baucus broke ranks to support a Medicare prescription drug benefit that Democrats viewed as a giveaway to drug companies.\n\nAs Mr. Obama ran for president in 2008, with universal health care coverage as a major campaign theme, Mr. Baucus began preparing for the legislation. He held hearings, convened a bipartisan retreat and spent months pursuing Republicans on his committee, and eventually got one \u2014 Olympia J. Snowe of Maine \u2014 to vote for the measure. \u201cHe was relentless,\u201d said Ms. Snowe, now retired. She ultimately rejected the more liberal bill fashioned by the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid.\n\nThe courtship frustrated Democrats, who said that Mr. Baucus was jeopardizing the bill\u2019s chances. Among the critics was Jim Messina, a former Baucus aide who regards the senator as a second father and was then Mr. Obama\u2019s deputy chief of staff.\n\n\u201cI thought the negotiations with Republicans went on too long and was very loud in my opinion about that,\u201d Mr. Messina said.\n\nBut Republicans gave Mr. Baucus credit. \u201cIt was a very, very difficult assignment for him,\u201d said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah.\n\nMr. Baucus says the \u201ctrain wreck\u201d remark grew out of his frustration with administration officials whose testimony on the readiness of HealthCare.gov, the online insurance exchange, \u201cdidn\u2019t pass the smell test.\u201d He said that it was intended as a message to the White House and that he did not regret it.\n\n\u201cGot their attention,\u201d he said.\n\nThe next day, Denis R. McDonough, the White House chief of staff, started biweekly meetings with Mr. Baucus and arranged for weekly phone calls with Ms. Sebelius. In the months before the exchange went live Oct. 1, Mr. Baucus said the two repeatedly assured him that HealthCare.gov would be ready.\n\nDid they lie? \u201cI don\u2019t think so; I don\u2019t know,\u201d Mr. Baucus said.\n\nMr. McDonough declined to be interviewed, although he sent an email saying he valued Mr. Baucus\u2019s guidance and counsel. \u201cHe knows the ins and outs of the policy and sees around the corners,\u201d Mr. McDonough wrote.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ms. Sebelius said much the same and that the health agency had adopted some of Mr. Baucus\u2019s ideas, like a \u201cone-stop shop\u201d website for small businesses.\n\nLooking ahead, Mr. Baucus said last week that he viewed himself as an \u201cenabler in chief\u201d who could help the administration put the law on stable footing before he retired. On Wednesday, after news of his impending nomination leaked out, he waved off reporters, saying simply, \u201cIt is not for me to discuss.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20131218120635, "twitter": {"description": "Senator Max Baucus of Montana is soon to be nominated as President Obama\u2019s next ambassador to China.", "creator": "@sherylstolberg", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/us/politics/baucus-still-fretting-over-health-law-he-shepherded.html?pagewanted=all", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/12/19/us/BAUCUS/BAUCUS-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "title": "Baucus, Conflicted Architect of Health Overhaul, Is Obama\u2019s Pick for China", "site": "@nytimes", "card": "summary"}, "xlarge": "images/2013/12/19/us/BAUCUS/BAUCUS-articleLarge.jpg", "thumbnail_width": 75, "hdl_p": "Baucus, Conflicted Architect of Health Overhaul, Is Obama\u2019s Pick for China", "sectionfront_jsonp": "http://json8.nytimes.com/pages/politics/index.jsonp", "DISPLAYDATE": "December 18, 2013", "edt": "NewYork", "keywords": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Diplomatic Service  Embassies and Consulates,United States Politics and Government,Appointments and Executive Changes,Baucus  Max,Walsh  John E,Senate Committee on Finance,HealthCare.gov,Democratic Party,Congress,China,Montana,United States", "xlarge_height": 328, "description": "Senator Max Baucus of Montana is soon to be nominated as President Obama's next ambassador to China.", "PT": "Article", "author": "SHERYL GAY STOLBERG", "thumbnail_150": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2013/12/19/us/BAUCUS/BAUCUS-thumbLarge-v3.jpg", "per": "Baucus, Max;Walsh, John E", "slug": "19baucus", "xlarge_width": 600, "byl": "By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG", "thumbnail_150_height": 150, "dsk": "U.S. / Politics", "lp": "Senator Max Baucus of Montana is soon to be nominated as President Obama\u2019s next ambassador to China.", "tom": "News", "thumbnail": "http://www.nytimes.com/images/2013/12/19/us/BAUCUS/BAUCUS-thumbStandard-v3.jpg", "news_keywords": "Congress,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,China,US Politics,Montana,Democrats,US", "ARTICLE_TEMPLATE_VERSION": 700, "CG": "us", "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "dat": "December 18, 2013", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "hdr_img": "/images/article/header/sect_us.gif", "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.nytimes.com/", "org": "Senate Committee on Finance;HealthCare.gov;Democratic Party", "thumbnail_height": 75, "geo": "China;Montana;United States", "thumbnail_150_width": 150, "utime": 20131219150607, "og": {"url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/19/us/politics/baucus-still-fretting-over-health-law-he-shepherded.html?pagewanted=all", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2013/12/19/us/BAUCUS/BAUCUS-videoSixteenByNine1050-v3.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Senator Max Baucus of Montana is soon to be nominated as President Obama\u2019s next ambassador to China.", "title": "Baucus, Conflicted Architect of Health Overhaul, Is Obama\u2019s Pick for China"}, "pdate": 20131218, "des": "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Diplomatic Service, Embassies and Consulates;United States Politics and Government;Appointments and Executive Changes", "articleid": 100000002607264, "cre": "The New York Times", "emailThisHash": "Sn+ourtPqsOX7NwU5XoCSw", "hdl": "Baucus, Conflicted Architect of Health Overhaul, Is Obama\u2019s Pick for China", "SCG": "politics", "PST": "News"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd816d\"", "article_summary": "He is also the conflicted architect of Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law.\nBut it is health care, more than any other issue, that has defined Mr. Baucus in recent years.\n\u201cIt is my belief that for major legislation to be durable, sustainable, it has to be bipartisan,\u201d Mr. Baucus said.\nAs Mr. Obama ran for president in 2008, with universal health care coverage as a major campaign theme, Mr. Baucus began preparing for the legislation.\nIn the months before the exchange went live Oct. 1, Mr. Baucus said the two repeatedly assured him that HealthCare.gov would be ready."}
