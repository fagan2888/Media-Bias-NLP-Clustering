The D.C. Health Department shutdown District hotspot Fig & Olive Thursday evening to investigate where the source of a salmonella outbreak is coming from.

According to WTOP:

Environmental and food samples have been collected. Twenty cases of possible salmonella have been identified, but [two] have been confirmed. Three of those cases occurred over Labor Day weekend, as people were admitted to Sibley Memorial Hospital.

A spokeswoman for Fig and Olive says they are cooperating with officials to figure out where the disease is coming from.

The Washington Post reported:

Janet Turim, Heather Lepkowicz and two other colleagues were trying to put the day behind them on Sept. 1 at Fig & Olive. They were enjoying drinks and luxuriating in a meal of Moroccan-spiced chicken, rosemary lamb chops and other dishes that, by their own account, lived up to their expectations. Within 48 hours, all four of the Arnold & Porter law firm employees were sick, some more than others. Turim missed two days of work. On Friday, Sept. 4, she finally went to her doctor.

“Basically, we thought it was just food poisoning,” Turim told the Post. “They didn’t give me any antibiotics or anything.”

Turim says even now, a full week after visiting Fig & Olive, she hasn’t been able to consume a full meal.

No single dish or ingredient seems to be the source. As of now, the health department does not know when test results of the environmental and food samples from Fig & Olive will come back.
