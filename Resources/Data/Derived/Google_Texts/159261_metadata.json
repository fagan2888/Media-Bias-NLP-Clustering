I recently read that one California hospital charged $10 for a blood cholesterol test, while another charged over 1,000 times more. But I didn't know the price craziness extended to prescription drugs.\n\nPrice problems\n\nOrrange and I recently spoke by phone. Traditionally, she told me, doctors have been \"abysmal\" at talking to patients about the cost of the drugs they're prescribing. And patients, she said, were embarrassed to ask about the price.\n\nShe recalled that she had her \"aha\" moment when a patient finally said to her: \"You forgot to tell me the biggest side effect of my medication\u2026the cost.\"\n\nThe patient was on to something, Orrange said.\n\nMore than a quarter of Americans did't fill prescriptions throughout one year, because they couldn't afford them, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted in September 2013. Almost half of uninsured respondents said they hadn't filled prescriptions because they couldn't afford them.\n\nThe organization also found that 30 percent of people were \"very worried\" about not being able to afford the prescription drugs they need.\n\nShopping smarter\n\nAs with the medical procedures in our PriceCheck project, the problem is that it is difficult for consumers to shop around to find the cheapest price for their drugs, said Orrange.\n\nShe said brand name drugs tend to have a set price, but the price of generic drugs can vary greatly by pharmacy.\n\nOrrange tipped me off to one service that tackles that problem: GoodRx is essentially an Orbitz.com for generic drugs, she said. Consumers can enter their drug and zip code, and compare the cash prices and available coupons at local pharmacies. GoodRx also offers a free discount card. Full disclosure: Orrange blogs for GoodRx.\n\nOrrange said she now uses GoodRx and its app to help patients search for the best deal on their prescriptions. She said it's benefiting people at all points on the insurance spectrum.\n\nSome have discovered that the cash price for a generic drug is cheaper than their prescription drug co-pay, noted Orrange. Sometimes, uninsured patients learn that their local pharmacies offer drugs at an equivalent \u2013 or cheaper \u2013 price than the county hospital's pharmacy. Some people have discovered that they can save money by getting a larger dosage, and splitting the pill in half, she said.\n\nThis Los Angeles Times article has several other tips for reducing your medication costs. It also refers to other websites intended to help people access prescription medications they can't afford. They include:\n\nRx Outreach, a non-profit, mail-order pharmacy for lower-income people;\n\nNeedyMeds, a non-profit that offers information about programs for people who can't afford their medication or care. It also offers a free discount card to people at any income level and insurance status.\n\nRxAssist, which helps consumers find information about free and low-cost medicine programs. It also offers a drug discount card.\n\nEveryone benefits\n\nOrrange is excited about this new focus on the cost of drug prices. She feels it's promoting better drug compliance, and preventing complications and hospitalizations, and \"there's no downside to that.\"\n\nDo you shop around for prescription drugs?
