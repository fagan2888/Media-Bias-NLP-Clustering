In recent months, it has tried to step up enforcement, including a $10 million settlement with ACE Cash Express after accusing the payday lender of harassing borrowers to collect debts and take out multiple loans.\n\nA payday loan, or a cash advance, is generally $500 or less. Borrowers provide a personal check dated on their next payday for the full balance or give the lender permission to debit their bank accounts. The total includes charges often ranging from $15 to $30 per $100 borrowed. Interest-only payments, sometimes referred to as \u201crollovers,\u201d are common.\n\nLegislators in Ohio, Louisiana and South Dakota unsuccessfully tried to broadly restrict the high-cost loans in recent months. According to the Consumer Federation of America, 32 states now permit payday loans at triple-digit interest rates, or with no rate cap at all.\n\nThe CFPB isn\u2019t allowed under the law to cap interest rates, but it can deem industry practices unfair, deceptive or abusive to consumers.\n\n\u201cOur research has found that what is supposed to be a short-term emergency loan can turn into a long-term and expensive debt trap,\u201d said David Silberman, the bureau\u2019s associate director for research, markets and regulation. The bureau found more than 80 percent of payday loans are rolled over or followed by another loan within 14 days; half of all payday loans are in a sequence at least 10 loans long.\n\nThe agency is considering options that include establishing tighter rules to ensure a consumer has the ability to repay. That could mean requiring credit checks, placing caps on the number of times a borrower can draw credit or finding ways to encourage states or lenders to lower rates.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Regulators prepare rules on payday loans to shield borrowers", "title": "Regulators prepare rules on payday loans to shield borrowers", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Regulators prepare rules on payday loans to shield borrowers", "title": "Regulators prepare rules on payday loans to shield borrowers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/02/01/regulators_prepare_rules_on_payday_loans_to_shield_borrowers/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/payday-loans.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Regulators prepare rules on payday loans to shield borrowers", "title": "Regulators prepare rules on payday loans to shield borrowers", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/02/payday-loans.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Hope Yen", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The bureau found more than 80 percent of payday loans are rolled over or followed by another loan within 14 days; half of all payday loans are in a sequence at least 10 loans long.\nAccording to the Consumer Federation of America, 32 states now permit payday loans at triple-digit interest rates, or with no rate cap at all.\nA payday loan, or a cash advance, is generally $500 or less.\nFull details of the proposed rules, expected early this year, would mark the first time the agency has used the authority it was given under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law to regulate payday loans.\nThe CFPB isn\u2019t allowed under the law to cap interest rates, but it can deem industry practices unfair, deceptive or abusive to consumers."}
