The Republicans are blaming him for every foreign hotspot including Iraq, Ukraine and Israel.\n\nEvery domestic problem also seems to be the President\u2019s doing, so much so that the Republicans led by Speaker of the House John Boehner even launched a lawsuit against him.\n\nAt first, I thought all this was overkill. After all, how can one man be responsible for so many things going wrong? But then it occurred to me: the Republicans are on to something good here. It\u2019s kind of like the dog-ate-my-homework all-purpose excuse \u2013 Obama did it.\n\nSo now I\u2019ve jumped on the bandwagon and am prepared to let Barack Obama take the heat for anything unpleasant in my life. For example, I\u2019m not happy at work. My job sucks, my boss is a tyrant and I dread the next few years until I can retire.\n\nClearly it\u2019s not my fault that I\u2019m stuck in this horrible situation. So whose fault is it? You got it; it\u2019s Obama\u2019s fault. If he would just get off his backside and get the economy moving again, things would pick up at my company, my boss would get promoted to the head office and I\u2019d get to work for somebody reasonable.\n\nMy kid is a terror. He won\u2019t do anything I tell him and his performance at school is abysmal. I used to think I had something to do with this problem but it turns out I don\u2019t. You guessed right; it\u2019s Obama\u2019s fault.\n\nWho\u2019s the guy who promised a big overhaul in our educational system? Who was going to recruit more teachers, pay them more and institute stricter standards for pay raises? Obama, that\u2019s who. If my kid\u2019s failing at school, I don\u2019t have to look any further than the guy in the Oval Office to know who to blame.\n\nMy wife can\u2019t stand me. She thinks that I should be sharing the household chores and not spending so much time watching TV and drinking beer. Thanks again, Obama. Wasn\u2019t it you who promised women equal wages and a more equitable sharing of domestic chores? Listen pal, that\u2019s your problem, not mine. And if my wife wants to point the finger at someone for this situation, she should remove it from my face and start shaking it in front of your schnozz.\n\nThe family dog\u2019s no picnic these days either. He\u2019s getting old, starting to come down with new ailments and racking up more vet bills than a three-legged pig. That\u2019s just the way it is, you say? No way. This is Obama\u2019s fault. He promised health care coverage for everyone and I don\u2019t recall him exempting dogs from that promise. How come the Affordable Care Act doesn\u2019t cover pets? I dunno; why don\u2019t you ask Obama?\n\nAnd then there\u2019s my neighbor. He says the pine tree in our backyard is overhanging his back lawn and killing the grass. He also says our common fence is an eyesore and is insisting that I share the cost of replacing it.\n\nYou know who I blame? I blame Obama and I\u2019ll tell you why. Ever since he got into office, he\u2019s been soft on our enemies and one of those enemies is my neighbor. In fact, I\u2019m beginning to think my neighbor is an out and out terrorist and we all know what Obama said he\u2019d do to terrorists. Come on Obama; it\u2019s time to step up to the plate and do the right thing. I suggest you start right here at 437 Pleasant Valley Drive.", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "BJRhhAX0-HMwLuYcMtPOB6NAdO7bUX3D7seeI_tQT-Q", "generator": "Woo Framework Version 1.0.8"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd27f0\"", "article_summary": "You got it; it\u2019s Obama\u2019s fault.\nThis is Obama\u2019s fault.\nYou guessed right; it\u2019s Obama\u2019s fault.\nObama, that\u2019s who.\nI used to think I had something to do with this problem but it turns out I don\u2019t."}
