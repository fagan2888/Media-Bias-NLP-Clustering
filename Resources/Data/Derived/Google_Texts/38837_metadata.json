Instantly, the burly offensive lineman became \u201coverwhelmingly excited\u201d that he was about to play for a former Heisman Trophy candidate and NFL quarterback.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t until Andrade walked into an office inside the football building in Alamosa just last week, and saw Rosenbach\u2019s rookie card with the Phoenix Cardinals sitting on a desk, that he began to truly appreciate his coach\u2019s football odyssey.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, no way!\u2019 \u201d said Andrade, a senior from Tucson. \u201cHe was under center and he was taking the snap, and it just finally hit me that this guy has done it all. It was really exciting.\u201d\n\nIf the 48-year-old Rosenbach hasn\u2019t experienced everything one can in football, he certainly will soon. After nine months on the job, his first as a head coach, Rosenbach will guide the Grizzlies into their season opener at Texas A&M-Commerce on Thursday.\n\nRosenbach may seem to be a long way from the sold-out Pac-10 stadiums he played in as a star quarterback at Washington State or the big cities he played in during his NFL career. But that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t exactly where he believes he\u2019s supposed to be.\n\n\u201cMy dad was a coach, so I grew up with a 16-millimeter clicker in my hand watching film,\u201d Rosenbach said. \u201cIt was in my blood. I don\u2019t think I ever planned being a coach. I think the only thing I had ever planned on when I was younger was being in the NFL \u2014 that was my dream.\n\n\u201cThen you go through life and things happen, and you go back to where your roots are a lot of the time.\u201d\n\nRosenbach dealt with injuries early and often during his NFL career. He had a bright second season in the league in 1990, playing all 16 games and rushing for more yards than any quarterback except Randall Cunningham. But he missed the entire 1991 season because of a knee injury and his brief career was never the same.\n\nAlong the way, Rosenbach became disillusioned by the coldhearted nature of the league, perplexed by how players could be virtually ignored when they were injured.\n\n\u201cThe one thing I learned about the NFL \u2026 the camaraderie and pageantry and the tradition, it\u2019s not the same in the NFL as it is in college,\u201d he said. \u201cYou look at it and go, \u2018Gosh, you wish it was better in that league.\u2019 \u201c\n\nOnce he left the NFL, Rosenbach had no intention of returning to the sideline as a coach. But the game had its hooks in him, most notably the kinship with teammates he felt most during his playing days in college.\n\nRosenbach made his first foray into coaching as the quarterbacks coach at NAIA member St. Ambrose (Iowa) in 1999. Jobs directing quarterbacks and offenses followed at Eastern Washington, Washington State, New Mexico State, Montana and Weber State.\n\nIn 2013, Rosenbach took the job as offensive coordinator at UNLV and helped the Rebels reach their first bowl game in 15 years. After his second season at UNLV, Rosenbach was ready to embark upon his first head coaching job. When he heard that Marty Heaton had stepped away as the head coach at Adams State after seven seasons, Rosenbach threw his hat in the ring.\n\n\u201cWhen he came on his interview, everybody on the (search) committee said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s our football coach,\u2019 \u201d Adams State athletic director Larry Mortensen said. \u201cHe wanted to be here, and that was important. He\u2019s not looking to get to the next place.\u201d\n\nRosenbach has worked diligently in his first year in Alamosa to embolden the RMAC school\u2019s traditions. He has guided his team through a number of community-service projects. He has worked to connect with former players and bring them back to campus.\n\n\u201cPeople tend to want to get more involved in the program when there is something that recognizes the past a little bit,\u201d Rosenbach said.\n\nAlong the way, he has often reminded his players that football is supposed to be fun.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a player\u2019s coach, and he\u2019s been easy to talk to from the beginning,\u201d said Grizzlies defensive back Ryan Holland. \u201cGuys are excited to play for him.\u201d\n\nAnd the guy in the football card is ready to coach them.\n\nNick Kosmider: 303-954-1516, nkosmider@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickkosmider", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Timm Rosenbach guiding Adams State Grizzlies, who know \u201cthis guy has done it all\u201d", "title": "Timm Rosenbach guiding Adams State Grizzlies, who know \u201cthis guy has done it all\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/29/timm-rosenbach-guiding-adams-state-grizzlies-who-know-this-guy-has-done-it-all/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150829__BN20150830_C1_BNSP30FBCROSENBACH1p1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150829__BN20150830_C1_BNSP30FBCROSENBACH1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-29T22:08:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T09:34:52+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdadea\"", "article_summary": "Jobs directing quarterbacks and offenses followed at Eastern Washington, Washington State, New Mexico State, Montana and Weber State.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a player\u2019s coach, and he\u2019s been easy to talk to from the beginning,\u201d said Grizzlies defensive back Ryan Holland.\n\u201cWhen he came on his interview, everybody on the (search) committee said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s our football coach,\u2019 \u201d Adams State athletic director Larry Mortensen said.\nBack in December, Austin Andrade devoured all the information the Internet had to offer on Timm Rosenbach, who had just been named the new football coach at Adams State.\nAfter nine months on the job, his first as a head coach, Rosenbach will guide the Grizzlies into their season opener at Texas A&M-Commerce on Thursday."}
