There\u2019s voting\u2014a governance method\u2014to show they have no confidence in the president.\u201d\n\nIn a statement provided by a faculty group, called Faculty@IC, members said the vote shows the level of disapproval they have for Ithaca College\u2019s leader.\n\n\u201cThese results are also remarkable because so many people voted, despite fears of retribution in this toxic environment, when we have the most dismal morale in recent history,\u201d said Nick Kowalczyk, an associate professor of writing.\n\nIthaca College\u2019s Student Government Association held a similar vote last month\u2014which Stewart said effectively gave the faculty the go-ahead to cast their own votes of no confidence\u2014and 72 percent of those who voted said they did not have confidence in Rochon, according to the campus newspaper, The Ithacan.\n\n\u201cThe message that has come through to me in the form of the student and faculty votes has been a difficult one to hear, but I am listening,\u201d Rochon said in a statement. \u201cI understand that many people on our campus are frustrated with the pace of change and with my own role in effecting it. I remain determined to improve Ithaca College\u2019s culture for the better, and that includes improving my own approach to collaborating with our faculty, staff, and students.\u201d\n\nThe Ithaca College Board of Trustees has the power to remove Rochon from his post and plans to discuss his future in the coming weeks.\n\n\u201cWe know that in many respects this discussion has been difficult, yet we also believe that it demonstrates our community\u2019s strong dedication to building a better future for Ithaca College,\u201d Board of Trustees Chairman Tom Grape said in a statement. \u201cAs the discussion goes on, we ask that all of us in the IC community conduct it with respect for one another and with a commitment to the open exchange of different ideas and perspectives.\u201d\n\nA \u2018Springboard\u2019\n\nTensions among Rochon, the faculty, and students have been brewing over the last few months, and disapproval of Rochon came to a head last month after a student-activist group called People of Color at Ithaca College, or POC at IC, perceived three separate events as racist.\n\nThe first involved public safety officers who allegedly made \u201cracially insensitive\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d statements during training sessions with Ithaca College resident assistants.\n\nThe second incident involved an off-campus party hosted by a fraternity unaffiliated with the college in October themed \u201cPreps and Crooks.\u201d Students and alumni viewed the theme as \u201cracially charged\u201d and a \u201cmicroaggression.\u201d\n\nThe last event occurred during a panel called \u201cBlue Sky Reiminaging,\u201d during which an African-American alumna said she had a \u201csavage hunger\u201d to succeed professionally. A Caucasian Ithaca College alumnus also on the panel repeated the description and called the woman a \u201csavage\u201d several times.\n\nIn response to the events, People of Color at Ithaca College called on Rochon to address the incidents. The group disagrees with what they believe were inconsistent responses from the administration.\n\nMore than 1,000 students participated in a \u201cwalk-out\u201d in further protest of Rochon on Nov. 11 and People of Color at Ithaca College held another last week, where chants of \u201cTom Rochon: Resign\u201d rang out, according to The Ithacan.\n\nRochon appeared at the protest and encouraged students to \u201cengage in dialogue.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything good on a college campus happens because of community,\u201d Rochon said at the event. \u201cWe get things done only by working together, and that includes looking candidly at our flaws and the ways in which we do not meet our aspirations.\u201d\n\nAfter the event, Stewart, who attended, said Vice President for Finance and Administration Gerald Hector spoke with students for several hours and said the blame could not only be placed on Rochon.\n\n\u201cWhat I think what is happening is we\u2019re trying to deal with an issue of race, diversity, and inclusion, and we\u2019re projecting it all on one person because he\u2019s a leader,\u201d Hector said, according to the Ithacan. He continued:\n\nI\u2019m a vice president of color, and I can tell you it\u2019s not just Tom. \u2026 You have to have a dialogue, even if you have hurt feelings. You\u2019re not going to get there by simply just protest, protest, protest.\n\nFaculty, though, said his comments at the event further demonstrated his unwillingness to address students\u2019 concerns, and both Faculty@IC and People of Color at Ithaca College say Rochon should resign.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s behavior at Friday\u2019s event was an excruciating public spectacle and the final unraveling of a moral authority that is unlikely to be rehabilitated by anything he does at this point,\u201d Asma Barlas, a professor in the Department of Politics, said in Faculty@IC\u2019s statement.\n\nThe faculty\u2019s vote of no confidence in Rochon occurred following their own public acts of discontent with Ithaca College\u2019s president. Last month, two dozen faculty members penned an open letter listing their complaints against Rochon and expressing no confidence in him.\n\nThe list included disapproval with his \u201ctop-down, out-of-touch leadership,\u201d \u201cdisregard for minority community members,\u201d and \u201cblurred vision and misdirection,\u201d among other complaints.\n\nStudent-led protests at Ithaca College occurred alongside similar ones held at the University of Missouri and Yale University. Though many of the students\u2019 concerns echo those at the other schools, albeit with different racist incidents, Stewart said issues with Rochon began long before racial tensions exploded at the other two schools.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of campuses across the nation that are doing similar protests, and even though it\u2019s happened at the same times, ours was in the works before Mizzou,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce [Ithaca students] realized there were other protests on college campuses, it was a springboard.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cPeople ... decided to voice their opinion through this vote and show they\u2019re not just going to protest,\u201d student spokesman Kyle Stewart said.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cPeople ... decided to voice their opinion through this vote and show they\u2019re not just going to protest,\u201d student spokesman Kyle Stewart said.", "title": "Ithaca Students, Faculty Express \u2018No Confidence\u2019 in President", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151215_IthacaCollege_Quinn.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-16T09:05:03+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1NS8iUr"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "\u201cPeople ... decided to voice their opinion through this vote and show they\u2019re not just going to protest,\u201d student spokesman Kyle Stewart said.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151215_IthacaCollege_Quinn.jpg"}, "title": "Ithaca Students, Faculty Express \u2018No Confidence\u2019 in President", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "higher ed", "published_time": "2015-12-15T19:47:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-16T09:05:03+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ithaca College, University of Missouri, Tom Rochon, Yale University, Kyle Stewart, People of Color at Ithaca College"}, "article_summary": "You\u2019re not going to get there by simply just protest, protest, protest.\nStudent-led protests at Ithaca College occurred alongside similar ones held at the University of Missouri and Yale University.\nA Caucasian Ithaca College alumnus also on the panel repeated the description and called the woman a \u201csavage\u201d several times.\nThe faculty at Ithaca College on Monday cast overwhelming votes of no confidence in President Tom Rochon, a vote that came just weeks after students at the college expressed similar opposition to Ithaca\u2019s leaders.\nThe faculty\u2019s vote of no confidence in Rochon occurred following their own public acts of discontent with Ithaca College\u2019s president."}
