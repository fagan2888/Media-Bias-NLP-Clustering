So why exactly is there so much angst among some craft beer fans at the sale of Breckenridge Brewery to beer giant Anheuser-Busch?

There is no shortage of small independent breweries remaining in Colorado. In fact, there are more such breweries than ever.

And their market share is likely to continue to grow given how popular tastes are evolving.

More to the point, what is the goal of the craft beer movement? Isn’t it to produce great beer in a wide spectrum of styles? Surely the beer itself is not corrupted merely by change of ownership.

One of the beautiful things about the present beer culture is its huge diversity. So long as that isn’t at risk by the occasional purchase of a brewery by a corporate behemoth — and it isn’t — handwringing is premature.

Many craft brewers, we’re sure, will stay local and independent. Others will harbor larger ambitions involving expanded sales and interstate distribution — and a few of those will find themselves courted by legacy giants, which have been rocked by sliding market share in major product lines.

It’s how the marketplace works and there’s nothing sleazy or sinister about it. Purists who second-guess a brewery’s decision to accept an attractive offer ought to reassess their self-righteousness.
