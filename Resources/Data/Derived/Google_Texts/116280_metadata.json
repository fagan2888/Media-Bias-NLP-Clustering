Sammy Watkins probably played his finale as well. And Clemson even got to take a little swipe at rival South Carolina.\n\nTwo years ago, the Tigers limped out of the Orange Bowl.\n\nThis time around, they were all smiles, and with good reason.\n\nBoyd threw for 378 yards and five touchdowns, Watkins had a record-setting night with 16 catches for 227 yards and two scores, and No. 12 Clemson rallied to beat No. 7 Ohio State 40-35 on Friday in the Orange Bowl \u2014 a game the Tigers lost by 37 points just two years ago.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago we got our butts kicked on this field,\u201d Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said. \u201cAnd it has been a journey to get back. We\u2019re 22-4 since that night. And we are the first team from the state of South Carolina to ever win a BCS game.\u201d\n\nBoyd\u2019s 5-yard pass to Stanton Seckinger with 6:16 remaining put the Tigers (11-2) ahead to stay, despite allowing 20 consecutive points in wasting an early 11-point lead. Watkins became Clemson\u2019s career receptions leader and set an Orange Bowl record for yardage, in what\u2019s expected to be his last game before turning pro. Martavis Bryant caught two more TD passes for the Tigers, who posted consecutive 11-win seasons for the first time in school history.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very special night,\u201d Boyd said. \u201cJust the significance of this game, not for me particularly, not for this team particularly, but for this university \u2026 I couldn\u2019t pick a better way to go out as a senior.\u201d\n\nHe likely wasn\u2019t thinking that after his final pass as a Tiger, one that was intercepted near midfield with 1:27 left. But Ohio State quarterback Braxton Miller \u2014 who was shaken up in the fourth quarter, saying afterward he had a cracked rib and a shoulder issue \u2014 was picked off two plays later, and the Tigers ran out the clock.\n\nMiller threw for 234 yards and Carlos Hyde ran for 113 more for Ohio State (12-2), which led 29-20 in the second half but wound up losing its second straight game \u2014 after having won each of its previous 24 under coach Urban Meyer, whose record in Bowl Championship Series games fell to 4-1. Corey Brown had 116 yards receiving for the Buckeyes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to sting for a while, probably a long while because we didn\u2019t finish,\u201d Meyer said. \u201cIt was right there.\u201d\n\nOhio State wound up allowing 115 points in the season\u2019s final three games. The Buckeyes gave up exactly that many in the season\u2019s first six games.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not a championship-caliber defense right now,\u201d Meyer said.\n\nThe Buckeyes took that 29-20 lead after Hyde picked up 31 yards on 4th-and-inches, then went airborne to break the plane of the goal line on the next play.\n\n\u201cI felt like the offense was starting to get clicking at that point,\u201d Hyde said. \u201cI thought we could make it happen.\u201d\n\nThen the mistakes started coming in bunches for Ohio State. A fumbled punt return and an interception led to touchdown grabs by Watkins and Bryant, putting the Tigers up entering the fourth.\n\nHyde caught a 14-yard scoring pass from Miller with 11:35 left, giving the Buckeyes a one-point lead, but Clemson and Boyd went on one last scoring march to give the Tigers the BCS win they\u2019ve been seeking for years.\n\nBoyd finished with 505 all-purpose yards, outgaining Ohio State by 78 yards himself.\n\n\u201cWhat a legacy,\u201d Swinney said. \u201cHe put an exclamation point on it tonight.\u201d\n\nWhen Clemson played in the Orange Bowl two years ago, the Tigers gave up 21 points in the final 2:29 of the first half, letting a close game get blown wide open on the way to a 70-33 loss to West Virginia.\n\nThis time, the game didn\u2019t get away.\n\nBoyd\u2019s 3-yard touchdown pass to Bryant had Ohio State facing a 20-9 deficit, but two scores in a 3\u00bd-minute span gave the Buckeyes a 22-20 halftime lead. Clemson left Jeff Heuerman wide open down the middle for a 57-yard touchdown pass from Miller, making it a one-score game. And on a drive aided by a 15-yard penalty against Clemson\u2019s Darius Robinson, Miller ran in from 3 yards with 12 seconds left to give the Buckeyes their first lead.\n\nBut the game changed again, and in the end, Boyd and the Tigers were standing tall.\n\n\u201cIt just means we\u2019re one step closer to our ultimate goal,\u201d Swinney said, \u201cand that\u2019s to be the best in the country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two years ago, the Clemson Tigers limped out of the Orange Bowl.
