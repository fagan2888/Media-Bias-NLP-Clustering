They\u2019re the loyal customers who buy the expensive tickets and donate generously.\n\nAt the same time, it has to excite newcomers, those younger generations raised on the quick-cuts of action movies and the constant blip of high-tech screens. They are opera\u2019s future \u2014 if it\u2019s going to have one.\n\nAnd, like all good operas, it has to be dramatic, engaging, paced, pretty, well-acted and sung like it was the last music to be performed on earth. Lots of pressure there.\n\n\u201cThe Magic Flute,\u201d now on stage at the Ellie Caulkins Opera House, seems fully aware of its multiple responsibilities and tackles them head on. It\u2019s a busy outing that works hard to be all things to all people. The production ticks enough things off its to-do list that both old and new audiences will likely find it engaging.\n\nYou can\u2019t get any more traditional than Mozart and \u201cThe Magic Flute\u201d is one of the top five operas produced annually, going strong two centuries in. The fairy tale story, about a prince who must outwit an evil queen and persevere through Herculean tests, has some of the genre\u2019s more exciting arias.\n\nThe famous one, the difficult song of vengeance from the devilish Queen of the Night, is the show stopper and that is true of Opera Colorado\u2019s version. Soprano So Young Park hits the piece\u2019s impossible high notes with all the rage they require. Her brilliant purple gown is the exclamation point on her colorful character.\n\nThere are other fine vocals, coming when it counts from Jonathan Boyd, as the protagonist Tamino, and Maureen McKay, as his beloved Pamina. Both sing with considerable warmth and they are paired well. Meanwhile, conductor Joseph Mechavich balances the volume of his fine orchestra with extreme sensitivity.\n\nDirector Daniel Witzke comes with a background in musical theater and he presents the opera with considerable flash. The costumes are showy and the movement is over-the-top. There are four dancers who flit in and out of this production mysteriously, giving it the sort of edge that might challenge formalists. Newcomers won\u2019t know what to make of it, though they\u2019ll probably go along for the ride.\n\nBut the signature of this production is its ambitious set. It\u2019s interesting that the backdrops are more virtual than real. Fire, forests, cathedrals, palaces and floating heads come and go in the form of projections on minimalist pieces of architecture.\n\nSometimes it works, the scenery keeps your gaze and provides allure to a story that\u2019s notoriously, historically thin. Sometimes, it feels thin itself, temporary, too easy and disposable for a piece that has lasted the test of time.\n\nStill, the sets amount to a reasonable shake-up and only rarely distract from the fine music. Mozart probably wouldn\u2019t mind and his grandchildren, centuries removed, might not mind either.\n\n\u201cTHE MAGIC FLUTE\u201d Opera Colorado presents Mozart\u2019s masterpiece on May 5, 8 and 10.
