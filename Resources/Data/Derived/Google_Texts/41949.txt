Two people were taken into custody by Larimer County authorities after leading deputies on a high speed chase, officials said Saturday.

Jessica Lynn Padilla, 30, and Gilbert Padilla, 40, allegedly provided false information to a Larimer County Sheriff’s Office deputy who pulled the two over on 601 SW Frontage Road for allegedly having fake license plates, according a Larimer County Sheriff’s Office news release.

When the deputy asked Jessica to step out of the vehicle, she allegedly sped away on the frontage road and crossed the median southbound onto Interstate 25 from Fort Collins.

Deputies followed the car onto the interstate, east onto Highway 34 into Weld County and then west on Highway 34 toward Loveland, the release said. Speeds ranged from 7 to 95 miles per hour during the chase, the release said.

The suspects were allegedly throwing items out of the vehicle that officials later recovered and believed to be narcotics, the release said.

Deputies used a tire deflation device on the suspect’s vehicle as they were pulling into the Promenade Shops at Centerra. The deputies then took the pair into custody. The suspects were evaluated by medical professionals for minor injuries suffered during the incident.

Jessica Padilla was booked into the Larimer County Jail on the following allegations: vehicular eluding, criminal impersonation, unlawful possession of a controlled substance, tampering with physical evidence and six other offenses.

Gilbert was booked into jail on suspicion of tampering with physical evidence, criminal impersonation and two warrants he failed to appear for.

Three Larimer County Sheriff’s Office vehicles were damaged during the chase, but no officers were injured, the release said.
