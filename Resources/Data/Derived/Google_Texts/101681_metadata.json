At city schools where Southwest Community Health Center runs health clinics, as many as 26 percent of the students seen are uninsured, said Katherine S. Yacovone, president of Southwest.\n\nSpinelli and Yacovone both say the only things keeping them from setting up shop in all city schools are space and resources.\n\nStatewide, there are now 96 school-based health clinics licensed by the state Department of Public Health in 27 communities. In southwestern Connecticut, in addition to Bridgeport, there are school-based health clinics in Stamford, Norwalk, Stratford, Danbury, Ansonia, Milford and Newtown.\n\nMore Information By the numbers There are 13 school-based health clinics in city schools, soon to be 15. They include: Bassick High School, Central High School, Harding High School, Fairchild Wheeler High School, Blackham, Read, Roosevelt, Batalla, Columbus, Barnum/Waltersville, Dunbar, JFK Campus. In addition, a school-based health center is located in Bullard-Havens Technical High School in Bridgeport.\n\nSpinelli received approval from the city school board to open the Tisdale clinic earlier this month. He now must await federal approval, which can take up to three months, then apply for a state license, which requires a site visit. He is optimistic that the clinic can start signing up children by the end of December. A dental clinic to be operated across town at Curiale School, which won board approval last winter, is still working on its approvals.\n\nThe cost to run the clinics is, for the most part, split between the state and the providers, who also tap federal grants and carriers of children who do have insurance. Combined, the clinics run by Optimus and Southwest get about $1.1 million from the state to operate.\n\nCharmaine Worthy, principal at Tisdale School, can\u2019t wait. Although dental services have been offered by the University of Bridgeport\u2019s School of Dental Hygiene at Tisdale since 2008, the addition of Optimus means the services will be expanded. Worthy expects the clinic to help boost attendance, since students won\u2019t have to skip school to go to checkups.\n\nMarcia Lorentzen, dean of the Fones School of Dental Hygiene at UB, called the partnership a \u201cwin-win\u201d for the 326 Tisdale students treated in the dental clinic last year.\n\n\u201cWe have a very good working relationship with the nursing staff, teachers and Tisdale administrators,\u201d Lorentzen said.\n\nLiz Petrocelli, school nurse supervisor for the school district, is pleased, too. Even though starting this fall all city schools have a full-time nurse, an on-site health clinic can provide all or most of the services of a doctor\u2019s office, including shots and prescriptions.\n\nThe health center at Tisdale will open part-time to start, with a nurse practitioner, social worker and medical assistant. The hope is that it will become full-time in short order, Spinelli said.\n\n\u201cWe work well together,\u201d Petrocelli said, adding that if she could pick the site for the next school-based health clinic, it would be Johnson School.\n\nWorthy said she is excited because Tisdale has a large special-needs population and can use another health care provider to assist the school nurse.\n\n\u201cI am also excited that I will receive an additional social worker to assist with meeting the needs of my students,\u201d Worthy said.\n\nMental health services are on the rise at many of the clinics. At three of the centers run by Southwest, a new program is starting, in consultation with the Department of Children and Families, to identify and treat children who have witnessed trauma.\n\n\u201cIt depends on what the principal asks for,\u201d said Spinelli of the services offered.\n\nAt the district\u2019s JFK campus, which houses High Horizons and Multicultural Magnet Schools, for instance, there were 113 medical visits in the 2014-15 school year and 646 mental health visits, which generally means seeing a social worker. At Luis Munoz Marin School, there were 1,600 medical visits, 803 mental health visits and 134 dental visits.\n\nTo participate, students need only get parent permission. If the family has medical coverage, it is tapped, but if not, there is no charge to the family.\n\nFor many students, clinics serve as primary care providers, Yacovone said.", "article_metadata": {"SKYPE_TOOLBAR": "SKYPE_TOOLBAR_PARSER_COMPATIBLE", "description": "With the new Tisdale School-based health center, nearly half the students in the district will have access to virtually free health care at their schools, and in many cases free dental care and mental health services as well.  \u201cThere is a need,\u201d said Ludwig Spinelli, CEO of Optimus Health Care, one of two agencies that took over operation of the school-based clinics from the city health department in 2009.
