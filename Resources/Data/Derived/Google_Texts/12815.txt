If only it really was President Barack Obama rapping like Snoop Dogg in this “Drop It Like It’s Hot” parody produced by the #GetCovered campaign. Instead, the video, which features the refrain “Sign up ’cause it’s hot,” stars famed Obama impersonator and YouTube star Iman “Alphacat” Crosson.

Crosson has appeared in numerous videos as Obama over the years, rapping about killing Osama bin Laden in 2011 and delivering a blistering version of “99 Problems (But Mitt Ain’t One)” during the 2012 campaign. This appears to be the first time he is working with an arm of the Obama Administration in an official capacity.

So, sit back and enjoy the new song, which features some truly inspired lyrics like these:

“So don’t stand and diddle, my healthcare’s the ‘shizzle’ / It’s chock full of top notch healthcare ‘provizzles’ / We’ll cover all you’re ‘vizzles,’ your ‘dizzles,’ AND your ‘tizzles / Now while you figure that out, it’s back to that ‘chorizzle’”
