He is also blamed or praised, by some, for helping facilitate the federal government shutdown as a protest against Obamacare and for his leadership role in seeking concessions from Democrats in any debt-ceiling deal.\n\nAfter praising Cruz as a student, as he had done earlier this year, Dershowitz leveled some harsh claims against him.\n\n\u201cHe has to qualify among the brightest of the students,\u201d Dershowitz said, who added that Cruz is deeply principled.\n\nBut when it came to the shutdown and debt-ceiling fight, Dershowitz made his case.\n\n\u201cI think it raises very serious constitutional questions of the kind that Ted Cruz should be interested in. Could you imagine Hamilton and Madison sitting around and drafting the Constitution and the Federalist Papers. They\u2019re talking about how the government has to pay its debts, how it has to secure the credit of the United States, how the House of Representatives to originate bills on revenue. Nobody in a million years would have contemplated the power of Congress to shut down the government, to create doubts about our creditworthiness,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think you can make a very strong argument that what Ted Cruz is doing is deeply unconstitutional. Whether a court would accept that or say it\u2019s a political question is another issue, but Cruz is a principled man. He ought to look at the Constitution and look into his heart and ask himself, \u2018What would Alexander Hamilton have done,\u2019\u201d Dershowitz said.\n\nThe comments quickly found their way to the Internet and got an equally quick response from author and radio show host Mark Levin.\n\n\u201cDershowitz is dead wrong. We don\u2019t have to imagine anything,\u201d he told the Newsbusters website. \u201cCongress and only Congress can authorize borrowing under Article I. The president must first pay interest on the debt under the 14th Amendment. The federal government collects 10 times as much revenue each month as it needs to cover those payments. As long as the president complies with the Constitution there can be no default. This is basic stuff. Even a Harvard law professor like Dershowitz should comprehend it.\u201d\n\nCruz has emerged as the most talked-about figure in the Washington budget battle, and he might be at the center of another constitutional test, as any final bill that goes through the Senate will need to survive a cloture vote, with at least 60 senators agreeing to overcome a filibuster to bring a bill up for a vote.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, there were reports that a deal was struck with John Boehner, the House\u2019s speaker, to have the proposed Senate compromise voted on first by the House, which would limit potential efforts by Cruz, Mike Lee, and other conservatives to extend debate time in the Senate.\n\nCruz hasn\u2019t publicly indicated if he would try to block or slow down the bill in the Senate. But there are estimates that delays in the Senate could push the bill\u2019s passage closer to this weekend, and several days past the Thursday deadline for borrowing.\n\nRecent Constitution Daily Stories\n\nFive things to watch as the debt-ceiling fight comes to a head\n\nHow the Supreme Court can resolve the debt ceiling crisis\n\nInterview: The Bipartisan Policy Center\u2019s Shai Akabas on the debt-ceiling dilemma\n\nA few lessons for the current Congress from the First Congress\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, a noted liberal, threw the Constitution figuratively at GOP Senator Ted Cruz on Tuesday night, as tensions flared in the debt-ceiling debate.", "title": "Dershowitz throws the Constitution, figuratively, at Ted Cruz", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2013/10/dershowitz-throws-the-constitution-figuratively-at-ted-cruz/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Cruz640.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Cruz640.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "article": {"published_time": "2013-10-16T14:13:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-16T16:27:54+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/ncc/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd71ba\"", "article_summary": "Share:EmailHarvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, a noted liberal, threw the Constitution figuratively at GOP Senator Ted Cruz on Tuesday night, as tensions flared in the debt-ceiling debate.\n\u201cI think it raises very serious constitutional questions of the kind that Ted Cruz should be interested in.\n\u201cI think you can make a very strong argument that what Ted Cruz is doing is deeply unconstitutional.\nInstead, Dershowitz had harsh words for Cruz, his former law student at Harvard, whom he had praised this spring.\nAfter praising Cruz as a student, as he had done earlier this year, Dershowitz leveled some harsh claims against him."}
