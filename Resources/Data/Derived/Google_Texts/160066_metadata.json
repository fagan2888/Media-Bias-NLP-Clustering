The White House has called in a digital fix-it crew to work on key parts of the system, named after Lady Liberty\u2019s home -- Ellis Island. In February, GAO auditors deemed ELIS a \"high-risk\" IT project for wasting money and failing to demonstrate it can meet any system requirements.\n\nThe new audit found that the Office of Management and Budget, foreigners -- who fund the system through application fees -- and citizens have had little visibility into its pitfalls.\n\nOn the IT Dashboard, an official government website that tracks major federal computer investments, \u201cassessments of the Transformation Program reflected unreliable and, in some cases, inaccurate information,\" Cha said.\n\nThe most recent IT Dashboard rating from June 2014 scored the program as a category 3, medium-risk investment, which is an improvement from the February 2014 rating of 2, moderately high risk. The assessment states the program went through a rebaselining and that an operational analysis of USCIS ELIS was completed in August 2013.\n\nIn actuality, the schedule experienced a more than four-year delay and the agency did not rebaseline the program to bring it back within cost and schedule thresholds until last month, when GAO was putting the finishing touches on its report, Cha said.\n\nWithout timely and correct data, the agency's ability to steer the program forward might be limited, she said. Also, \"it risks reporting information on the federal IT Dashboard that is inaccurate or otherwise misleading, thus limiting OMB and congressional oversight,\" Cha said.\n\nDHS officials say they anticipate realistic information will be posted by Dec. 31.\n\nTo date, ELIS provides applicants the ability to renew or replace a green card. ELIS users also can electronically file I-526 or I-539 forms for obtaining an investor-conditional green card or extending a stay as a nonimmigrant, respectively. People can also pay USCIS immigrant fees through the system. Commercial enterprises can exchange documents with immigrant entrepreneurs seeking legal residency, via ELIS' Regional Center Document Library.\n\nTransformation, through the years, has undergone several overhauls to address funding and schedule concerns, including a shift from developing features all at once to an \"agile\" development approach that releases software in pieces to make sure each function works. The agency also switched from using a single contractor to a group of several vendors.\n\nEach of these moves bumped back full system deployment, which, according to the auditors, has dented predicted cost savings. In fiscal 2014, the tab for maintaining outdated systems that ELIS should have replaced was about $71 million.\n\nIn an April 29 DHS letter responding to a draft audit, department officials said the project would have churned through more dollars and years if the agency had not changed gears.\n\n\"If USCIS had continued to pursue the same acquisition strategy that had provided for limited capability,\" wrote Jim Crumpacker, director of the DHS GAO liaison office, \"the program would have far exceeded initial cost estimates and schedule. The department does not believe that GAO adequately considered the potential benefits and lower risks that resulted from revising the acquisition strategy for the program.\"", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Aliya Sternstein", "description": "DHS has reversed course on software development strategies, leading the price tag to balloon, auditors said.", "og": {"site_name": "Nextgov", "description": "DHS has reversed course on software development strategies, leading the price tag to balloon, auditors said.", "title": "This DHS Computer System Will Cost $2 Billion More than HealthCare.gov", "url": "http://www.nextgov.com/defense/2015/06/dhs-website-will-cost-3-billion-more-healthcaregov/115621/", "image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2015/06/18/061815dhsNG.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2015/06/18/061815dhsNG/open-graph.jpg", "description": "DHS has reversed course on software development strategies, leading the price tag to balloon, auditors said.", "site": "@nextgov", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "This DHS Computer System Will Cost $2 Billion More than HealthCare.gov"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-18T15:30:41Z", "sailthru.images.full": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2015/06/18/061815dhsNG.jpg", "sailthru.title": "This DHS Computer System Will Cost $2 Billion More than HealthCare.gov", "keywords": "contracting, immigration, immigration reform, uscis, citizenship and immigration services, acquisition, it dashboard, immigrants, green cards", "fb": {"admins": 578600878}, "sailthru.images.thumb": "http://cdn.nextgov.com/media/img/upload/2015/06/18/061815dhsNG/sailthru-thumbnail.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "contracting,immigration,immigration-reform,acquisition,immigrants,channel-nextgov->-defense,type-story,length-medium,site-nextgov", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Nextgov"}, "sailthru.description": "DHS has reversed course on software development strategies, leading the price tag to balloon, auditors said."}, "article_summary": "By contrast, computer systems for HealthCare.gov, the once-beleaguered Obamacare portal, cost $840 million, according to GAO.\nFederal auditors are blasting a decade-in-the-making government computer system that was supposed to simplify the immigration application process and improve national security.\nEach of these moves bumped back full system deployment, which, according to the auditors, has dented predicted cost savings.\nThe assessment states the program went through a rebaselining and that an operational analysis of USCIS ELIS was completed in August 2013.\nIn February, GAO auditors deemed ELIS a \"high-risk\" IT project for wasting money and failing to demonstrate it can meet any system requirements."}
