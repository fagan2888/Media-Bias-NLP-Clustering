It was because no one believed the incredible stories he told.\n\nSeifert lived in Nokomis, Ill. and volunteered for the Air Force at age 19 right before he was sent a letter to be drafted. He was in Vietnam from 1969 to 1970.\n\nHe volunteered for Vietnam because the government had a rule that only one family member could be sent to any one combat. His brother was in the Air Force and had a wife and child. \"I was still single and crazy,\" Seifert said.\n\nHe was with the military police and performed a variety of tasks in Vietnam. He delivered guns to a nomad group in the Vietnamese mountains called the Montagnard, pronounced mountain yard or \"mountain people.\"\n\nWelcoming them home Thank you: Community members are invited to thank Vietnam veterans for their service at 599-1218.

The chief of the tribe heard this story and decided to shoot a monkey to roast as a celebration of this rare sighting.\n\nThe arrow he shot with a crossbow was tipped with a sleeping substance. It arced through the air, hit a branch instead of the monkey, and whirled around to hit Seifert in the leg.\n\nSeifert said that in 1999, he saw a newspaper article about some new animals discovered in Vietnam. Among these were a barking deer and an Annamite striped rabbit.\n\nSeifert also used to bring candy and make slingshots for the children in those nomad tribes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of those boys was later adopted and brought to America. That boy recognized Seifert in a Walmart several years ago and said, \"You made me a slingshot!\"\n\nSeifert was transferred to another unit, he said, and spent nine months there, when the life expectancy in that area was 90 days.\n\nSeifert was well-aware of how unpopular the war was. \"We weren't allowed to finish it,\" he said. \"We could have stood arm to arm and walked the whole country and eradicated it. But that wasn't the intent.\"\n\nThe military built the infrastructure of South Vietnam with highways and military bases. And then they left and gave the people whatever they had. \"And where did it end up? In the hands of the North Vietnamese, anyway,\" Seifert said.\n\nWhen he got off the plane on his return in Seattle, Wash., he remembers seeing a group of bald monks. They saw he had a uniform on and they spat at him.\n\n\"As a military policeman, I smiled with a curious smile back at them and I told them, 'If you only knew, you wouldn't be spitting,'\" he said. Seifert and the other men went inside to change. He said that his fellow soldiers wanted \"to do something.\"\n\nSeifert told them, \"The best thing to do is to let them learn the lesson the long way. Sometimes they won't listen. They won't learn until it hits them in the face.\"\n\nHis family in Illinois welcomed him back with open arms because he had come back alive. He met his wife, Lynda, in 1972 in Cheyenne, Wyo., and they eventually settled in Colorado because they loved the mountains.\n\nNote from the Editor: This is the second in a series of weekly articles on Vietnam veteran homecomings.
