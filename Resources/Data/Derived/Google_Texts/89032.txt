As he campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has pitched himself as the candidate of the future- a fresh face for the GOP who will bring a fresh approach to policy problems that have long been frozen in place by partisan warfare.

On domestic issues like education and the economy, he's carved a fairly standard GOP profile, embracing private school vouchers and tax cuts while opposing Common Core education standards and Obamacare. He's been reliably conservative on social issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, and his approach to foreign policy tends to be more hawkish.

One notable sticking point for Rubio among conservatives has been his stance on immigration. He sponsored a comprehensive reform bill that included a path to citizenship in 2013, and he's since backed away from that effort, but he's continued stressing the need to overhaul U.S. immigration policy.
