They would be better off lowering those wages, being more realistic, accepting work, and getting back on their feet again. In other settings (not considered by Krueger), other workers seem to be too slow to move to new areas for new jobs, given the costs of being unemployed long-term. \u2026 OK, given all that, when those workers, hit by negative shocks, do not rush to go back to work at lower reservation wages, we then read a portrait of hysteresis, despair, and soul-crushing joblessness, a psychic swamp so difficult to escape that even summoning up the strength to go back to work may be difficult. In other words, would-be workers irrationally undervalue the benefits of having a job and they also underestimate the costs of remaining unemployed.\n\nNow let\u2019s switch settings. A benefit shock comes along, positive for many people, and it induces many of them to work less or not work at all. How happy should we be? And here I mean happy at the margin, due to their change in employment decision. People, it is rather difficult to have it here both ways. I guess it is possible that workers are irrational in changing their employment decisions in response to changes in relative dollar wage opportunities, but rational when changing their employment decisions in response to changes in relative benefit opportunities. It really is possible. But are any of you actually arguing that or holding some deep-seated reason for believing in that difference, other than perhaps the reason this post might have induced you to come up with? No, I see one assumption about a destructive choice in one context and the opposing assumption about a beneficial choice in the other context, without much regard for the tension or contradiction between those two assumptions \u2026. \u2026 A simpler possibility is that people undervalue the long-term benefits of having a job and thus in both settings the contraction in employment is a quite negative outcome. That is then very bad news for ACA, if only in expected value terms.\n\nHere is how I would frame the issue: There are specific classes of people who plainly benefit, in fairly uncomplicated ways, from benefits that provide an incentive to work less, or leave a job outright. The obvious examples are the ones that liberals keep invoking: Parents of young children (for whom the family-friendly tax overhaul that conservative reformers like to tout would presumably have a similar effect), and people with a disability or chronic medical condition that makes work a simple misery.\n\nBut there also lots of people who emphatically do not benefit from being given an incentive to either detach from the workforce or (if they\u2019re already unemployed or underemployed) remain detached rather than taking a lower-paying job. And given the current economic landscape, especially \u2014 in which persistently high unemployment coexists with a growing population of workers too discouraged to even look for work \u2014 the size and scope of a work-discouraging effect matters a great deal: The bigger the effect, the more likely that the people dropping out aren\u2019t just, say, parents cutting hours to spend more time at home while the other spouse works full time, but people we should want to be attached to the workforce, for their own long-term good and the good of the economy as well.\n\nWhich is why it\u2019s appropriate that the new C.B.O. projection of 2 million to 2.5 million job-equivalents disappearing has inspired more disquiet and debate than the old projection of 500,000-900,000 \u2026 because it\u2019s a sign, however provisional, that the costs of Obamacare\u2019s workforce effects might exceed the benefits. I don\u2019t see liberals reckoning seriously with that possibility, and I think they really should.", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140205122121, "BN": "douthat", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "opinion/douthat", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/douthat/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "February 5, 2014", "keywords": "Cowen Tyler,Labor and Jobs,Parenting,Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010),Unemployment,Uncategorized", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/douthat/Liberals, Obamacare and Work ( 20140205 )", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "douthat", "sourceApp": "blogs", "per": "Cowen, Tyler", "twitter": {"description": "What\u2019s missing from the optimistic gloss on the new Obamacare workforce projections.", "title": "Liberals, Obamacare and Work", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/liberals-obamacare-and-work/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "site": "@DouthatNYT", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002689932, "description": "What\u2019s missing from the optimistic gloss on the new Obamacare workforce projections.", "CG": "Opinion", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "February 5, 2014", "article": {"published_time": 1391620881, "author": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/rossdouthat/index.html", "section": "Opinion", "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/opinion/index.jsonp", "tag": "Uncategorized", "modified_time": "2014-02-06T03:09:49-05:00"}, "utime": 20140206030949, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140205, "pdate": 20140205, "des": "Labor and Jobs;Parenting;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (2010);Unemployment", "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "og": {"site_name": "Ross Douthat", "description": "What\u2019s missing from the optimistic gloss on the new Obamacare workforce projections.", "title": "Liberals, Obamacare and Work", "url": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/liberals-obamacare-and-work/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs_v5/../icons/t_logo_291_black.png", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/liberals-obamacare-and-work/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Liberals, Obamacare and Work", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/icons/t_logo_300_black.png", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc39e\"", "article_summary": "A benefit shock comes along, positive for many people, and it induces many of them to work less or not work at all.\nThey would be better off lowering those wages, being more realistic, accepting work, and getting back on their feet again.\nI don\u2019t see liberals reckoning seriously with that possibility, and I think they really should.\nIn other words, would-be workers irrationally undervalue the benefits of having a job and they also underestimate the costs of remaining unemployed.\nHere is how I would frame the issue: There are specific classes of people who plainly benefit, in fairly uncomplicated ways, from benefits that provide an incentive to work less, or leave a job outright."}
