Also, Air Force Baltic Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance will be cut from $4.4 million to $0.3 million, while Navy Marine Corps Baltic Operations Multinational Exercises will be chopped down to half a million, from $1.5 million. The budget also eliminates $175 million in funding provided to Ukraine.\n\nMeanwhile, apprehension of a Russian invasion in Eastern Europe continues to rise.\n\n\u201cOf course there is some threat, and in the Baltic states, we feel it very well here,\u201d Latvian MEP Roberts Zile tells Townhall.\n\nZile points out, as most politicians in the Baltics do, that the situation in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania differs drastically from that in Ukraine because the three states are NATO allies.\n\n\u201cThe constant question is, \u2018is Narva next?\u2019 or \u2018are the Baltics next?\u2019\u201d Tanel Sepp, Deputy Chief of Mission for the Estonian Embassy in Washington, tells Townhall. \u201cThe premise of the question is false. It is not about Estonia or the Baltics. In case one wants to pose this question, it ought to be \u2018is NATO next?\u2019 We are as much NATO as any other NATO country.\u201d\n\nThe NATO alliance will be heavily relied on should Russia choose to launch another Ukraine-style invasion.\n\nSome politicians wonder if NATO allies will indeed respond if Russia was to make a move on the Baltics. The United States -- considered the most crucial ally in NATO by many in the region -- did not respond in the strongest manner in response to Russian aggression in Ukraine, though it also operated under treaty obligations.\n\n\u201cWill it work, if it happens?\u201d Zile says, of NATO support. \u201cThis is the biggest question mark also for European parliamentarians.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe views on this situation if it should happen are very different among my colleagues in the European Parliament. There are some supporters of the position that NATO Article 5 works in this situation and all member states will do necessary steps to fight not only for Baltic States in a case like that. If NATO will not work under the famous Article number 5... NATO will be soon broken in pieces. I really can say that the European Parliament is very divided in this way.\u201d\n\nBaltic States are preparing for Russian action. The Lithuanian Ministry of Defense has even published and distributed a nearly 100-page pamphlet to instruct its citizens on what to do in case of invasion. The document gives practical advice on how to behave during an explosion, how to proceed if trapped under debris, and what to do if trapped in a city teeming with hostile military.\n\nWhen House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-TX) met with Lithuanian Defense Minister Juozas Olekas last week on his trip to the region, the two expressed solidarity between the two nations.\n\n\u201cThe European Security Initiative and Operation Atlantic Resolve is a particularly visible U.S. presence in Lithuania and a message that we are not on our own. Thank you to the United States, our strategic ally, for that,\u201d Olekas said in a statement.\n\nThornberry declined to comment on the proposed budget cuts.", "article_metadata": {"description": "As the conflict in Ukraine continues and tension rises in the Baltics, the Pentagons proposed 2016 budget significantly cuts funding for U.S. military programs in the Eastern European region..05/26/2016 2:34:48AM EST.", "author": "Vivian Hughbanks", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "As the conflict in Ukraine continues and tension rises in the Baltics, the Pentagons proposed 2016 budget significantly cuts funding for U.S. military programs in the Eastern European region.", "title": "Vivian Hughbanks  - As Eastern Europe Braces for Russian Aggression, Pentagon Budget Cuts Funding For Ukraine, Ops In Baltics", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/vivianhughbanks/2015/04/08/as-eastern-europe-braces-for-russian-aggression-pentagon-budget-cuts-funding-for-ukraine-ops-in-baltics-n1982043", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/163/c7dc0bb9-1a0f-412a-b40d-36fe169a0609.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "As the conflict in Ukraine continues and tension rises in the Baltics, the Pentagons proposed 2016 budget significantly cuts funding for U.S. military programs in the Eastern European region.", "title": "Vivian Hughbanks  - As Eastern Europe Braces for Russian Aggression, Pentagon Budget Cuts Funding For Ukraine, Ops In Baltics", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/vivianhughbanks/2015/04/08/as-eastern-europe-braces-for-russian-aggression-pentagon-budget-cuts-funding-for-ukraine-ops-in-baltics-n1982043", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/163/c7dc0bb9-1a0f-412a-b40d-36fe169a0609.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "As Eastern Europe Braces for Russian Aggression, Pentagon Budget Cuts Funding For Ukraine, Ops In Baltics, Vivian Hughbanks , Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ebf\"", "article_summary": "\u201cOf course there is some threat, and in the Baltic states, we feel it very well here,\u201d Latvian MEP Roberts Zile tells Townhall.\nAs the conflict in Ukraine continues and Baltic states prepare for war, the Pentagon\u2019s proposed 2016 budget significantly cuts funding for U.S. military programs in the Eastern European region.\nThe budget proposes that funding for Baltic Air Policing be cut from $15.5 million to $4.5 million in 2016.\nThe budget also eliminates $175 million in funding provided to Ukraine.\nI really can say that the European Parliament is very divided in this way.\u201dBaltic States are preparing for Russian action."}
