Between 30 and 35 percent of the Connecticut exchange\u2019s business comes from agents and brokers, exchange CEO Jim Wadleigh said.\n\nUnitedHealthcare has already signaled the possibility that it would pull out of the public exchanges in 2017. UnitedHealth Group CEO Stephen Hemsley said last month that the company was losing money on exchange business and would determine during the first half of 2016 whether it would continue to sell plans through public exchanges.\n\nAsked about the decision to stop broker commissions, the company issued a statement that said, \u201cOur current actions are consistent with our long-stated approach to continually evaluate the dynamics of exchanges as they evolve and adjust to changes in the market accordingly.\u201d\n\nHemsley alluded to the move in his Nov. 19 earnings update, saying the company had taken \u201cseveral immediate actions to reduce our exposure in this segment,\u201d including suspending marketing and reducing or eliminating commissions in most markets.\n\nUnitedHealthcare has a relatively small presence on Connecticut\u2019s exchange, Access Health CT. The company didn\u2019t participate in any of the exchanges created under the federal health law in 2014, the first year they operated. In 2015, its prices on Connecticut\u2019s exchange were among the highest, and the company captured about 2 percent of customers (as of March, at the end of the open-enrollment period, 2,278 people had signed up for the company\u2019s plans).\n\nThe company\u2019s prices for 2016 coverage remain among the highest on the exchange, and as of mid-November, UnitedHealthcare had received only about 2.7 percent of the business from new customers.\n\nThe company sells plans through exchanges in 34 states.\n\nAccording to a memo the company sent to brokers and agents, UnitedHealthcare will not pay commissions for new individual exchange enrollments starting Jan. 1. The change also applies to health plans sold outside the exchanges that are identical to exchange plans \u2013 so-called \u201cmirror plans.\u201d UnitedHealthcare will still pay commissions for exchange plans sold before that date. The changes don\u2019t apply to New York and California, the memo said.\n\nThe move will likely have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on sales of exchange business, said John Calkins, president of Bozzuto Associates in Watertown.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s United\u2019s direction, they could forget any business from agents,\u201d he said.\n\nCommissions for agents and brokers are included in the premiums insurance customers pay. Asked whether anything would prohibit a company from collecting premiums with commissions included but not paying them when agents or brokers sell the policies, Connecticut Insurance Department spokeswoman Donna Tommelleo said, \u201cThe department is in discussions with UnitedHealthcare.\u201d\n\nWadleigh called agents and brokers a key partner for the exchange in educating consumers about how health insurance works, and said he expects they won\u2019t sell UnitedHealthcare products if they aren\u2019t compensated for it.\n\nWadleigh said he hasn\u2019t spoken to other insurers about the issue, but wondered whether others will also make changes to their broker commissions.\n\n\u201cUnited could be starting an industry trend,\u201d he said. If that happens, he added, the exchange will have to revisit how it sells its business.\n\nAlthough leaders of other insurance companies have indicated that they plan to stick with exchanges for now, Wadleigh said he expects them to examine the business climate in each state where they do business \u2013 and that exchanges will have to help ensure the climate is conducive to insurers offering products.\n\nInsurer HealthyCT said it has no plans to change its broker commission program.\n\n\u201cBrokers are our valued partners in helping to educate, enroll and serve our on- and off-exchange members,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nConnectiCare also plans to continue paying commissions for exchange plans, a spokeswoman said.\n\nA spokeswoman for Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield did not immediately respond to questions Wednesday about whether the company would change their commission policies.", "article_metadata": {"standout": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/12/09/unitedhealthcare-to-stop-paying-commissions-for-obamacare-exchange-plans/", "news_keywords": "Health Care, Access Health CT, Affordable Care Act, insurance, UnitedHealthcare", "original-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/12/09/unitedhealthcare-to-stop-paying-commissions-for-obamacare-exchange-plans/", "og": {"site_name": "The CT Mirror", "description": "UnitedHealthcare plans to stop paying commissions for insurance policies offered through exchanges beginning Jan. 1, a move brokers say signals the company\u2019s retreat from Obamacare business.", "title": "UnitedHealthcare to stop paying commissions for Obamacare exchange plans", "url": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/12/09/unitedhealthcare-to-stop-paying-commissions-for-obamacare-exchange-plans/", "image": "http://ctmirror.org/files/2015/02/obamacareIcon.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ctmirror", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ariellelb"}, "syndication-source": "http://ctmirror.org/2015/12/09/unitedhealthcare-to-stop-paying-commissions-for-obamacare-exchange-plans/", "fb": {"admins": "10103384569292809,7920421,10205310995067193", "app_id": 439136839547306}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "The change also applies to health plans sold outside the exchanges that are identical to exchange plans \u2013 so-called \u201cmirror plans.\u201d UnitedHealthcare will still pay commissions for exchange plans sold before that date.\nConnectiCare also plans to continue paying commissions for exchange plans, a spokeswoman said.\nUnitedHealthcare plans to stop paying commissions for insurance policies offered through exchanges beginning Jan. 1, a move brokers say signals the company\u2019s retreat from Obamacare business.\nBetween 30 and 35 percent of the Connecticut exchange\u2019s business comes from agents and brokers, exchange CEO Jim Wadleigh said.\nThe move will likely have a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on sales of exchange business, said John Calkins, president of Bozzuto Associates in Watertown."}
