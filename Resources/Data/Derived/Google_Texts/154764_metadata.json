The temperature is expected to drop to the high 30s in much of the state.\n\nThe rain will persist through Wednesday and into early Thursday, though it should taper off before people hit the road for their Thanksgiving dinners, Bunker said. Wednesday should see highs in the 40s, and Thanksgiving stands to be a bit chillier.\n\nA change to the storm\u2019s track could change the forecast and drop a rain-snow mix on the state, Bunker noted, though that is less likely.\n\nBut with one of the biggest travel days of the year approaching, any inclement weather could be cause for concern.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing is, if folks are planning to travel to higher elevations like to the Poconos, make sure they have good snow tires or chains, and make sure they check the road conditions before leaving,\u201d Bunker said.\n\nThere\u2019s a potential that drainage issues in rainy areas could lead to road flooding, he added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s common sense that with this significant weather coming, there could be travel delays,\u201d Bunker said. \u201cSo folks need to pay attention to what\u2019s going on with the forecast.\u201d\n\nThe storm is being blamed for eight deaths across the West, where it dropped snow and heavy rain on areas unaccustomed to to the winter weather.\n\nIn New Mexico, five inches of snow was predicted for many areas of the desert state, and roadways were already being shut down. An accident there killed a 4-year-old girl.\n\nThree other storm-related deaths were reported Saturday in a crash in the Texas Panhandle involving nearly a dozen vehicles.\n\nIn California, where the storm first hit, three deaths have been linked to the weather since Thursday. In southern Arizona, firefighters recovered the body of a man who was swept away by high waters Friday in the Santa Cruz River.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "'@mobile','@river','nj-weather'", "title": "Nasty winter storm will likely soak N.J. before Thanksgiving", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Nasty winter storm will likely soak N.J. before Thanksgiving\", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/11/deadly_storm_headed_to_soak_nj_before_thanksgiving.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/11/wednesday-storm-mapjpg-fde12e1a9772ad3a.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"11708801\", \"pub_date\": \"2013-11-24T16:03:14Z\", \"author\": \"Tom Wright-Piersanti/The Star-Ledger\", \"tags\": [\"@mobile\",\"@river\",\"nj-weather\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/11/13832220-thumb_square_large.jpg", "creator": "@LedgerTWP", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary", "description": "Though there is still some variability in the storm&#8217;s track, meteorologists are expecting New Jersey will likely avoid snow, except in the northwest corner and high-elevation area"}, "article_date_updated": "Sunday, November 24, 2013,  4:48 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/ledgerupdates_impact/photo/2013/11/wednesday-storm-mapjpg-fde12e1a9772ad3a.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"twrightpiersanti\", \"author_nickname\": \"Tom Wright-Piersanti/The Star-Ledger\", \"author_id\": \"8744221\", \"source_blog_name\": \"New Jersey Real-Time News\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Though there is still some variability in the storm&#8217;s track, meteorologists are expecting New Jersey will likely avoid snow, except in the northwest corner and high-elevation area", "title": "Nasty winter storm will likely soak N.J. before Thanksgiving", "url": "http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/11/deadly_storm_headed_to_soak_nj_before_thanksgiving.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Sunday, November 24, 2013, 11:03 AM", "article_author": "Tom Wright-Piersanti/The Star-Ledger", "Description": "Though there is still some variability in the storm&#8217;s track, meteorologists are expecting New Jersey will likely avoid snow, except in the northwest corner and high-elevation area"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd729d\"", "article_summary": "A winter storm that hit the West with deadly fury is headed east to soak New Jersey just before Thanksgiving.\nA change to the storm\u2019s track could change the forecast and drop a rain-snow mix on the state, Bunker noted, though that is less likely.\nThe storm is expected to hit the state late Tuesday night and bring rain and winds of up to 20 mph, according to Bunker.\nIn California, where the storm first hit, three deaths have been linked to the weather since Thursday.\nThe rain will persist through Wednesday and into early Thursday, though it should taper off before people hit the road for their Thanksgiving dinners, Bunker said."}
