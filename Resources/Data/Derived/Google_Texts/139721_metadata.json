I felt they did a good job of controlling the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball.\u201d\n\nIf the Rams had won Friday, they would have won the division if Utah State beat Boise State, but now that goal is unreachable for CSU. Also gone is their long-shot chances of reaching a major bowl game as the highest-rated champion from a non-power conference in the College Football Playoff rankings.\n\nWith sophomore Nate Romine stepping in for injured starting quarterback Kale Pearson, Air Force pulled off the upset and closed the regular season at 9-3 (5-3 in the MW), a startling improvement from its 2-10 record in 2013. The Falcons were 6-0 at home and posted their third nine-win season in eight years under coach Troy Calhoun.\n\nRomine, who started five times in the Falcons\u2019 injury-plagued 2013, answered the call. He ran for 61 yards and, while only 6-of-15 passing, threw for 135 yards, with Garrett Brown catching five of his throws for 88 yards \u2014 including the key 26-yarder in the final minute that set up the winning field goal.\n\nThe Falcons\u2019 24-10 third-quarter lead disappeared as the Rams rallied back for the tie early in the fourth, but Air Force was resilient. With the game tied 24-24, CSU was driving toward a possible game-winning score, but the Falcons stopped the Rams\u2019 Dee Hart for no gain on a fourth-and-2 from the AFA 42 with 38 seconds left.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d call it again,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get a yard, you don\u2019t deserve to win the ballgame, anyway. They did a great job at the point of attack and we didn\u2019t stop \u2019em on defense coming back. You guys know me by now, I\u2019m not here to get a participation ribbon, we\u2019re going to go and try to win the ballgame.\u201d\n\nFrom there, the big play was Romine\u2019s 26-yarder to Brown, and Conant\u2019s kick was on target as the clock ran out.\n\n\u201cIt puts a damper on it because you have an opportunity to have 11 wins and sweep the Front Range, which is something that hasn\u2019t been done a lot at Colorado State,\u201d McElwain said of the season. \u201cSo, yeah, it\u2019s disappointing and yet, you know what, we\u2019ve done some good things too and come a long ways. \u2026 I love those kids in that locker room, this staff, and the fans that came down here to watch the ballgame. I\u2019m really sorry and disappointed that they\u2019re going to go home with a loss.\u201d\n\nUnder pressure on most of his throws, CSU quarterback Garrett Grayson was 23-46 for 366 yards and three touchdowns, and Biletnikoff Award finalist Rashard Higgins had 12 receptions for 193 yards and two TDs \u2014 including a tough catch at the side of the end zone for the 2-yard score with 10:58 left as the Rams pulled into the 24-24 tie. Grayson\u2019s other TD was a 76-yarder to Xavier Williams.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a great football team, well-coached and they don\u2019t make many mistakes,\u201d Grayson said. \u201cThey outplayed us today. \u2026 Obviously, we wanted to be 11-1, but 10-2 is a (heck) of a record and I think we all should be proud of this team. I know I\u2019m proud to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei\n\nGame balls\n\nWeston Steelhammer.

Air Force\u2019s kicker made both of his field-goal attempts, from 33 and 39 yards. The 39-yarder won the game for the Falcons.\n\nRashard Higgins. CSU\u2019s star wide receiver added to his Biletnikoff Award contention with 12 catches for 193 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nTerry Frei, The Denver Post\n\nAmazing about-face\n\nAir Force\u2019s victory over Colorado State on Friday capped an amazing reversal from last season. After finishing 2-10 in 2013, the Falcons completed this regular season 9-3. The school\u2019s record-setting seven-game turnaround is tied as the best in the nation with Western Michigan. The previous best turnaround at Air Force was in 1958, when the Falcons went 9-0-2 after going 3-6-1 the previous season.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado State\u2019s division title hopes dashed in loss to Air Force", "title": "Colorado State\u2019s division title hopes dashed in loss to Air Force", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/28/colorado-states-division-title-hopes-dashed-in-loss-to-air-force/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141128_070350_dee-hart.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141128_070350_dee-hart.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-28T17:25:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T17:12:57+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "article_summary": "AIR FORCE ACADEMY \u2014 As it turned out, there were two surprising \u2014 bordering on the amazing \u2014 turnarounds in Colorado college football this season, and the resilient Air Force Falcons on Friday won the showdown between the two.\nPHOTOS: Air Force beats Colorado State 27-24\u201cGive them all the credit in the world,\u201d said CSU coach Jim McElwain.\nThe previous best turnaround at Air Force was in 1958, when the Falcons went 9-0-2 after going 3-6-1 the previous season.\nThe Falcons\u2019 24-10 third-quarter lead disappeared as the Rams rallied back for the tie early in the fourth, but Air Force was resilient.\nThe Air Force strong safety had an interception, and he was in on the fourth-down stop of CSU tailback Dee Hart during the game\u2019s final minute."}
