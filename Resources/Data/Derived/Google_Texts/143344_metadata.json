The case drew renewed attention when the two fled to Mexico after a video surfaced that appeared to show Ethan Couch, fresh from a rehabilitation center, at a party where people were drinking. If Couch drank alcohol, he violated the terms of his probation.\n\nTonya Couch made an initial appearance in a Texas courtroom Friday on a charge of hindering the apprehension of a felon. She did not enter a plea. The judge set bail at $1 million, and Couch\u2019s attorney, Stephanie Patten, filed a motion asking for bail to be reduced.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "\u201cAffluenza\u201d mom complains about conditions at jail", "title": "\u201cAffluenza\u201d mom complains about conditions at jail", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/01/08/affluenza-mom-complains-about-conditions-at-jail/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160108__20160109_A16_ND09AFFLUENZARAILp1.jpg", "height": 423}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160108__20160109_A16_ND09AFFLUENZARAILp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-09T04:08:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-19T00:12:38+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Tonya Couch, 48, and her 18-year-old son, Ethan, have been the objects of derision since he was sentenced to probation, rather than jail time, for the 2013 wreck.\nThe case drew renewed attention when the two fled to Mexico after a video surfaced that appeared to show Ethan Couch, fresh from a rehabilitation center, at a party where people were drinking.\nThe judge set bail at $1 million, and Couch\u2019s attorney, Stephanie Patten, filed a motion asking for bail to be reduced.\nTonya Couch made an initial appearance in a Texas courtroom Friday on a charge of hindering the apprehension of a felon.\n\u201cShe expressed a slight displeasure about her accommodations, and I told her this was a jail and not a resort,\u201d Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson said at a news conference."}
