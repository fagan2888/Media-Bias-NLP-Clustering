Not that he expected it to be.\n\nThe Nuggets guard knew his playing time would be limited, which is never easy for a former college star. Harris was the centerpiece of the Michigan State attack a year ago.\n\nPatience, he understood, would have to be a close friend in the NBA. But he didn\u2019t want to accept not playing well when he did get an opportunity. A major shooting slump has been both perplexing and disappointing for a rookie eager to make a good first impression.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re just thinking so fast,\u201d Harris said. \u201cYou want to make something happen. You\u2019re trying to do it all at one time instead of just relaxing and just playing.\u201d\n\nThe fool\u2019s gold was the ease with which Harris scored in his NBA debut. He made 6-of-10 shots and scored 13 points in only 18 minutes as the Nuggets rolled to a victory at Indiana on Nov. 14.\n\nIt took Harris seven appearances over the next three weeks to make six shots combined. His confidence took a hit. That\u2019s when Nuggets guard Randy Foye swooped in to help. Foye took Harris under his wing and, among many other things, advised him not to put too much pressure on himself. He told Harris to expect slumps but to let the down times motivate him to work harder.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a different game in the NBA. And that\u2019s something that I\u2019m trying to explain to him \u2026 that it\u2019s a long road,\u201d Foye said.\n\nHarris is shooting only 23.6 percent from the field, but coach Brian Shaw is giving him more playing time of late.\n\nHe scored seven points on 2-of-7 shooting in Denver\u2019s loss to the Chicago Bulls on Thursday night. One of those was a 3-pointer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking it one game at a time, just trying to improve each game,\u201d Harris said. \u201cJust trying to go out and help the team, impact the game in any way possible and try to just keep getting better. Things are starting to slow down a little bit. Still kind of fast at times but definitely starting to slow down.\u201d\n\nHarris\u2019 inclusion in the Nuggets\u2019 past two games was his first back-to-back appearances in two weeks.\n\n\u201cI want him to understand that you\u2019re going to have 30 good games and you might have 10 bad games, but at the end of the day that\u2019s just 40 games,\u201d Foye said. \u201cIf you have another 30 and 10 bad, that\u2019s 60 good and 20 bad. I\u2019ll take that any day. Just don\u2019t compound the issue by putting a lot of pressure on yourself.\u201d\n\nHarris appreciates the advice.\n\n\u201cRandy\u2019s been great, telling me to relax and slow down. He\u2019s being there being real supportive.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dempseypost\n\nMEMPHIS AT DENVER\n\n7 p.m. Saturday, ALT; 950 AM\n\nSpotlight on Marc Gasol: The younger brother of Chicago\u2019s Pau Gasol has always been a defensive force, but this season he has combined that with the best offensive season of his NBA career. He entered the Grizzlies\u2019 road game Friday night against the Los Angeles Lakers averaging a career-high 20.1 points, along with 8.3 rebounds and 1.6 blocked shots.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nNuggets: Wilson Chandler played through a quad contusion Thursday at Chicago and reported no complications afterward. \u2026 Darrell Arthur continues to work himself back to being healthy enough to play his usual role. He hasn\u2019t played in any of the Nuggets\u2019 past five games because of a strained lower left leg. He has been available in some of those games, but coach Brian Shaw is opting not to play him unless it\u2019s an emergency.\n\nGrizzlies: Zach Randolph, averaging 16.1 points and 11.4 rebounds, had missed five consecutive games entering Friday because of a swollen knee. \u2026 Memphis assistant Jeff Bzdelik was the coach of the Nuggets from 2002-05. He also coached Air Force and Colorado. \u2026 The Nuggets have a two-game losing streak against the Grizzlies.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets\u2019 rookie guard Harris slowly getting up to speed", "title": "Nuggets\u2019 rookie guard Harris slowly getting up to speed", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/02/nuggets-rookie-guard-harris-slowly-getting-up-to-speed/", "image": {"width": 466, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150102__20150103_B5_SP03BKNNUGGETS1p1.jpg", "height": 654}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150102__20150103_B5_SP03BKNNUGGETS1p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-02T21:28:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T10:55:43+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcfe36\"", "article_summary": "Foye took Harris under his wing and, among many other things, advised him not to put too much pressure on himself.\nIt took Harris seven appearances over the next three weeks to make six shots combined.\n\u201cI\u2019m taking it one game at a time, just trying to improve each game,\u201d Harris said.\nThe Nuggets guard knew his playing time would be limited, which is never easy for a former college star.\nThat\u2019s when Nuggets guard Randy Foye swooped in to help."}
