The dozen measures included IQ and memory scales, auditory learning and animal naming tests, an oral word association test, a connect-the-dots trail-making test, and a test of her ability to copy complex figures. The result: reassurance and relief. Everything was in the normal range for her age, and she registered as superior on the ability to perform tasks and solve problems. Fears about memory issues, commonplace among those of us who often misplace our cellphones and mix up the names of our children, are likely to skyrocket as baby boomers move into their 70s, 80s and beyond.\n\nMany may be unwilling to wait to have their memories tested until symptoms develop that could herald encroaching dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s disease, like finding one\u2019s glasses in the refrigerator, getting lost on a familiar route or being unable to follow directions or normal conversation.\n\nBut nor do people have to endure the extensive tests my friend had. Simple exams done in eight to 12 minutes in a doctor\u2019s office can determine whether memory issues are normal for one\u2019s age or are problematic and warrant a more thorough evaluation. The tests can be administered annually, if necessary, to detect worrisome changes.\n\nHowever, according to researchers at the University of Michigan, more than half of older adults with signs of memory loss never see a doctor about it. Although there is still no certain way to prevent or forestall age-related cognitive disease, knowing that someone has serious memory problems can alert family members and friends to a need for changes in the person\u2019s living arrangements that can be health- or even lifesaving.\n\n\u201cEarly evaluation and identification of people with dementia may help them receive care earlier,\u201d said Dr. Vikas Kotagal, the senior author of the Michigan study. \u201cIt can help families make plans for care, help with day-to-day tasks, including medication administration, and watch for future problems that can occur.\u201d\n\nLong the most popular screening test for memory disorders used by primary care doctors is the Mini-Mental State Exam, or MMSE, an eight-minute test in use since 1975. But neurologists say it is less discerning than the slightly longer Montreal Cognitive Assessment, or MoCA, introduced in 1996.\n\nBoth tests measure orientation to time, date and place; attention and concentration; ability to calculate; memory; language; and conceptual thinking. But while the MMSE is considered adequate for routine testing of cognitive function by the family doctor, its score can be skewed by a person\u2019s level of education, cultural background, a learning or speech disorder, and language fluency. And according to Dr. Roy Hamilton, a neurologist at the University of Pennsylvania, this test is not sensitive enough to detect signs of mild cognitive impairment.\n\nFurthermore, the MMSE doesn\u2019t test for problems with executive function, defined as the ability to organize, plan and perform tasks efficiently to reach a particular goal.\n\n\u201cExecutive function is typically the first area to suffer if you develop cognitive impairment,\u201d Dr. Sam Gandy, director of the Mount Sinai Center for Cognitive Health and of the NFL\u2019s neurological care program, reported last month in the School of Medicine\u2019s newsletter, Focus on Healthy Aging. \u201cTranslated into everyday life, it\u2019s executive function that enables us to carry out activities of daily living, such as dressing and preparing meals.\u201d\n\nThe Montreal Cognitive Assessment, which takes 10 to 12 minutes, is more difficult and can pick up problems the MMSE might miss, Hamilton has noted. It is also more sensitive, better able to discriminate between normal cognitive function and mild impairment or dementia. Still, many memory clinics and neurologists use both tests, along with others like those taken by my friend.\n\nThe Montreal test has 11 sections and a possible total score of 30 (25 or better is considered normal). It includes an executive function test called alternating trailmaking, in which lines must be drawn from numbers to letters in correct order, 1 to A, 2 to B, and so forth.\n\nMeasuring a person\u2019s ability to follow verbal commands includes counting backward from 100 by sevens. To assess abstract thinking, the test asks a person to find common features between two words in each of three pairs. Verbal fluency, a vocabulary test, requires producing 11 or more words that start with a specific letter. Copying a drawing of a cube and drawing a clock accurately assess visuoconstructional skills, and memory is checked by having the person try to recall five words that were read aloud earlier in the test.\n\nTaking such a test can be quite stressful, although allowances are made for nervousness. But practicing by taking the test in advance of an evaluation can skew the results and hurt the person taking it in the long run.\n\nThe MoCA test has proved valid for assessing people who are not demented but could be at risk for developing progressive cognitive decline.\n\nKeep in mind that neither the MMSE nor MoCA is definitive. Rather, they can indicate the need for a more extensive exam like the one my friend had.\n\nAlso, it helps to know when not to worry about memory problems. Dr. Kirk R. Daffner, director of the Center for Brain-Mind Medicine at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston, lists six \u201cnormal\u201d memory problems that should not cause concern: a tendency to forget facts or events over time, absent-mindedness, a temporary block in retrieving a memory, recalling something accurately only in part, having a memory distorted by the power of suggestion (the recalled memory may never have happened), and having a memory influenced by bias, experiences or mood.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/05/hfbrody191.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb528\"", "article_summary": "It is also more sensitive, better able to discriminate between normal cognitive function and mild impairment or dementia.\nAlso, it helps to know when not to worry about memory problems.\nBoth tests measure orientation to time, date and place; attention and concentration; ability to calculate; memory; language; and conceptual thinking.\nIt includes an executive function test called alternating trailmaking, in which lines must be drawn from numbers to letters in correct order, 1 to A, 2 to B, and so forth.\nStill, many memory clinics and neurologists use both tests, along with others like those taken by my friend."}
