A large fire just after midnight Friday morning destroyed two trucks for a document shredding company in a commercial lot and damaged two others.

The fire on the 2900 block of North El Paso Street was so large that neighbors that called in assumed it was a building on fire, said Capt. Steve Oswald, of the Colorado Springs Fire Department. In all, firefighters estimated the damage totaled $450,000.

Oswald said firefighters arrived on the scene at 12:19 a.m. – about six minutes after neighbors called in. Firefighters extinguished the blaze in 36 minutes and did not have complications because of the cold weather, Oswald said.

The trucks were owned by Cintas and were part of the company’s document shredding business. Oswald said one of the trucks was partially filled with materials to be shredded and the other truck was empty.
