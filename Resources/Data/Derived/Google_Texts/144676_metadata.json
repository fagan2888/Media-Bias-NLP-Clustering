Frazier died in 2011 at age 21, months after his release.\n\nAs an inmate, his medical care had been managed not by the county sheriff\u2019s office that runs the jail, but by a private company under contract.\n\nThat company, Corizon Health Inc., is under growing pressure after losing five state prison contracts, downgrades by analysts and increasing scrutiny of its care of inmates held by some of its largest customers, including New York City. Corizon, responsible for 345,000 inmates in 27 states, is the country\u2019s biggest for-profit correctional health provider, but is just one of many firms vying for billions of public dollars spent on prisoner care.\n\nFor-profit prison care raises questions about ceding public responsibilities to private companies. It turns, though, on a thornier issue: How do you ensure care of people that society mostly would prefer not to think about?\n\nInmates \u201care still human beings. I think some people forget that, I really do. They\u2019re somebody\u2019s child,\u201d said Shirley Jenkins, Frazier\u2019s grandmother.\n\nStates spend $8 billion a year on prison health care, a fifth of their corrections budgets, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts and the MacArthur Foundation. Local jails spend millions more.\n\nSome critics fault the idea of privatizing the job.\n\n\u201cThe problem is a structure that creates incentives to cut corners and deny care to powerless people that have no other options,\u201d said David Fathi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s National Prison Project.\n\nOthers say deficiencies with prison care go beyond whether it is privatized.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a great love for private health care \u2026 but I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re the source of the problem,\u201d said Dr. Marc Stern, former health services director for Washington state\u2019s prisons. Stern, who once worked for a Corizon predecessor in New York state, issued a 2012 report criticizing the company\u2019s care of Idaho prison inmates while serving as a court-appointed expert.\n\n\u201cI think the problem is how much money and effort we are willing to put into correctional health care,\u201d Stern said.\n\nSome critics, though, say Corizon is notably problematic.\n\n\u201cWe get letters from prisoners about medical care not being provided and the list is endless. And it\u2019s increased tremendously since Corizon took over,\u201d said Randall Berg, executive director of the Florida Justice Institute, who represents inmates petitioning for care.\n\nCorizon said it strives to provide quality care.\n\n\u201cWe are always troubled by any questions on the care provided to our patients and view this as an opportunity to reconfirm our commitment to operational ethics and professionalism,\u201d company spokeswoman Susan Morgenstern said in a written statement. The company declined to answer questions.\n\nCorizon\u2019s struggles are widespread.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Company\u2019s struggles highlight challenges of inmate care", "title": "Company\u2019s struggles highlight challenges of inmate care", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Company\u2019s struggles highlight challenges of inmate care", "title": "Company\u2019s struggles highlight challenges of inmate care", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/01/19/companys_struggles_highlight_challenges_of_inmate_care/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/profiting-from-prison-care.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Company\u2019s struggles highlight challenges of inmate care", "title": "Company\u2019s struggles highlight challenges of inmate care", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/01/profiting-from-prison-care.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Adam Geller", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe06fe\"", "article_summary": "States spend $8 billion a year on prison health care, a fifth of their corrections budgets, according to The Pew Charitable Trusts and the MacArthur Foundation.\n\u201cI think the problem is how much money and effort we are willing to put into correctional health care,\u201d Stern said.\nAs an inmate, his medical care had been managed not by the county sheriff\u2019s office that runs the jail, but by a private company under contract.\nOthers say deficiencies with prison care go beyond whether it is privatized.\nFor-profit prison care raises questions about ceding public responsibilities to private companies."}
