STEAMBOAT SPRINGS – Temperatures hovering in the upper 20s at Winter Park early Monday morning served as a chilling reminder to Ride The Rockies cyclists of the blizzard at Berthoud Pass the previous day that brought Day 1 of the 29th annual cycling tour in Colorado to a premature end for many of the 2,000 registered cyclists. However, as atypical as Day 1 shook out, Day 2 to Steamboat Springs over two mountain passes across 95 miles proved quintessential RTR.

By the 17th mile in Granby, sunny and clear skies escorted cyclists through Hot Sulphur Springs and Kremmling, and then over a pair of mountain passes – Muddy and Rabbit Ears – before descending 15 miles into Steamboat Springs, where the tour will camp for two nights after averaging 92 miles and 7,000 feet of elevation gain during the first two days of the tour.

The Day 3 course Tuesday is a 54-mile loop — billed as a “false recovery ride” — starting and ending here in Steamboat Springs and rolling through Oak Creek along Colorado Highway 131 and county roads.
