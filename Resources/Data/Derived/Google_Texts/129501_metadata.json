If you check out this new map from the New York Times, you may have your answer.\n\nThe Times helpfully gathered up the data on the uninsured and created a regional map showing which areas had high numbers of insured individuals and which didn\u2019t, and the pattern is unmistakable: districts that didn\u2019t vote for Obama didn\u2019t seem to care for Obamacare either, according to a New York Times report.\n\nThe uninsured map sure resembles an election results map, but instead of Republican districts they\u2019re uninsured districts, with the highest numbers of uninsured located in the South and the Southwest, heavily Republican areas.\n\nMeanwhile, the Northeast and upper Midwest \u2014 Democratic strongholds \u2014 showed the highest insured rates, with the percentage of uninsured dipping into the single digits, probably due to the fact that the Affordable Care Act isn\u2019t frowned upon there.\n\nThe map also shows some improvements in ACA coverage nationwide, with states like Pennsylvania and Indiana \u2014 which had been slow to expand Medicaid \u2014 showing improvements with uninsured rates. Meanwhile, in states like Mississippi, there\u2019s actually fewer people who have health insurance compared to previous years.\n\nOpposition to President Obama\u2019s policies, especially the Affordable Care Act, have certainly slowed enrollment and resulted in higher numbers of insured than the administration had hoped. His lack of popularity in Republican leaning districts seems to translate into lower participation via Obamacare.\n\nThe map does indicate drastic changes since 2013, when only 10 states had a percentage of residents who were uninsured that was lower than 9 percent. That has declined significantly to where only the South and the Southwest have those numbers, and everywhere else in the country is covered through some type of health insurance.\n\nOpen enrollment is beginning again, marking another important period for Obamacare and another litmus test for its performance.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"app_id": 290619631106325}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The uninsured map sure resembles an election results map, but instead of Republican districts they\u2019re uninsured districts, with the highest numbers of uninsured located in the South and the Southwest, heavily Republican areas.\nThe New York Times mapped out the uninsured in the United States, and one interesting pattern was hard to ignore.\nIf you check out this new map from the New York Times, you may have your answer.\nSo why aren\u2019t more people signing up for health care under Obamacare?\nThe map does indicate drastic changes since 2013, when only 10 states had a percentage of residents who were uninsured that was lower than 9 percent."}
