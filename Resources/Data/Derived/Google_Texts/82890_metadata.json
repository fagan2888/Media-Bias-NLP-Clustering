So why are pro-gay companies doing nothing about it?\n\nGeorgia is poised to pass the nation\u2019s harshest \u201creligious freedom\u201d law, allowing discrimination, judicial obstruction, and even domestic violence. Yet while the bill is far worse than Arizona\u2019s notorious \u201cTurn the Gays Away\u201d bill, it\u2019s attracted far less attention from national advocacy groups and businesses.\n\nThe bill, the \u201cGeorgia Religious Freedom Restoration Act,\u201d is one of a raft of similar bills (RFRAs, for short) wending their way through state legislatures across the country. The bills are part of the backlash against same-sex marriage, but they go much farther than that. Like the Hobby Lobby decision, which allows closely-held corporations to opt out of part of Obamacare, these laws carve out exemptions to all kinds of laws if a person (or corporation) offers a religious reason for not obeying them.\n\nFor example? Restaurants could refuse to serve gay or interracial couples, city clerks could refuse to marry interfaith couples, hotels could keep out Jews, housing developments could keep out black people (Genesis 9:18-27), pharmacies could refuse to dispense birth control, banquet halls could turn away gay weddings, schools could specifically allow anti-gay bullying, and employers could fire anyone for any \u201creligious\u201d reason.\n\nThe national movement to pass these laws is well-funded and well-coordinated; most of the laws are written by the same handful of conservative legal hacks in Washington, working for organizations like the Alliance Defending Freedom and Ralph Reed\u2019s Faith and Freedom Coalition, both of which have had a hand in the Georgia bill.\n\nJeff Graham, executive director of Georgia Equality, said in an interview with The Daily Beast that \u201cin the last two years, there have been 35 bills introduced around the country to establish or expand a RFRA. And there have been over 80 bills filed that specifically allow for discrimination against gay and trans communities.\u201d\n\nAs worrisome as these laws are, however, Georgia\u2019s is worse than most.\n\nFirst, the language is the strictest possible. As with other RFRAs, Georgia\u2019s act says that the government cannot \u201csubstantially burden a person\u2019s exercise of religion\u201d without a \u201ccompelling governmental interest\u201d and the \u201cleast restrictive means of furthering\u201d that interest. This is the classic three-prong test that was at issue in Hobby Lobby, and is considered extremely difficult to meet.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s RFRA also specifies that \u201cexercise of religion\u201d can be just about any \u201cpractice or observance of religion, whether or not compelled by or central to a system of religious belief.\u201d\n\nIn other words, if I say it\u2019s my religious exercise, it is.\n\nSecond, the Senate version of the bill was passed by its sponsor, State Senator Josh McKoon, with all kinds of shenanigans. He rammed it through the judiciary committee, which he chairs, while opposition members were in the bathroom.\n\nThen, on dubious procedural grounds, he refused an amendment by a fellow Republican that would have specified that the \u201creligious freedom\u201d could not be used to discriminate against others.\n\nIronically, says Graham, Georgia doesn\u2019t have that many protections for LGBT people in the first place.\n\n\u201cThis is a preemptive strike against the LGBT community,\u201d he says. \u201cIf this bill is not intended to allow discrimination, why were its sponsors so adamant about refusing to say so?\u201d\n\nMcKoon\u2019s bill passed the Republican-dominated State Senate on March 5, and now heads to the State House, where Republicans have a 2:1 advantage over Democrats, and where representatives have shelved their own version of the bill to try to pass McKoon\u2019s version.\n\nThe combination of these factors has led to a curious result: a law so strict that it will lead to a host of unintended consequences\u2014and has even led some Republicans to oppose it.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

Which is easy to provide; the Christian Domestic Discipline Network, for example, offers a host of rationales for \u201cwife spanking.\u201d And let\u2019s not forget Proverbs 13:24: \u201cHe who spares his rod hates his son. But he who loves him disciplines him diligently.\u201d\n\nGeorgia has numerous laws protecting child welfare, which is arguably a compelling state interest. But are such laws really the \u201cleast restrictive means\u201d of protecting it? Not necessarily. At the very least, the laws offer a novel defense against assault and battery.\n\nOr maybe not so novel. Graham says, \u201cWe have found cases where people used their religious views as an excuse to impede an investigation into child-endangerment and child-abuse charges. They were not ultimately successful, but they did slow down the investigations.\u201d\n\nWith the new law, they would be far better armed. In fact, says Graham, conservative district attorneys in Macon and Marietta have said that the bill would impede investigations and prosecutions of child abuse.\n\nIndeed, Georgia\u2019s RFRA recently gained an unlikely opponent: Mike Bowers, the former attorney general of Bowers v. Hardwick fame. As some may recall, that was the Supreme Court case that upheld Georgia\u2019s anti-sodomy law\u2014and Bowers was the named plaintiff.\n\nIn an open letter to Graham (PDF), Bowers said that the law is \u201cunequivocally an excuse to discriminate\u2026.[P]ermitting citizens to opt-out of laws because of a so-called burden on the exercise of religion in effect \u2018would permit every citizen to become a law unto himself.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis perhaps is one reason why conservatives like Bowers and the D.A.s in Macon and Marietta stand opposed to it. As Bowers wrote, \u201cthis legislation is not about gay marriage, or contraception, or even so-called \u2018religious freedom.\u2019 It is more important than all of these, because it ultimately involves the rule of law.\u201d\n\nWhat is the future of Georgia\u2019s RFRA?\n\nThe Georgia State House ends its session on April 2, and Graham predicts a tight vote. \u201cThis will probably go all the way to the final hours\u201d of the session, he said.\n\nOddly, the most effective forces in killing Arizona\u2019s \u201cTurn The Gays Away\u201d bill\u2014corporations and the Chamber of Commerce\u2014seem to be sitting this battle out. Maybe it\u2019s because Arizona was bidding on a Super Bowl and Georgia isn\u2019t. Or maybe it\u2019s because no one is paying attention. But for whatever reason, the corporate silence is deafening.\n\nThis is especially the case for Coca-Cola, which has spent millions to brand itself as pro-gay (remember that Super Bowl ad?) but has been mum on the Georgia bill.\n\n\u201cFor now, it appears that Coca-Cola has a relationship of convenience with the gay community,\u201d said Bryan Long, executive director of the progressive organization Better Georgia, in an email to The Daily Beast. \u201cThe company promotes equality when it serves the brand but won\u2019t stand up for us when we need it most.\u201d\n\nIf big business, national media, and national LGBT organizations continue to sit on the sidelines, the bill\u2019s fate may be a matter of vote-counting. The House bill had 59 cosponsors, out of 180 total members. But Graham pointed out that a pending non-discrimination bill has 78, including 19 Republicans.
