TOKYO (AP) â€” Asian stock markets were mostly lower Wednesday as investors kept a wary eye on developments in the Middle East after Turkey shot down a Russian warplane.

KEEPING SCORE: Japan's Nikkei 225 fell 0.5 percent to 19,821.14 and Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.5 percent to 22,473.38. China's Shanghai Composite Index was little changed while South Korea's Kospi lost 0.2 percent to 2,011.40. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 fell 0.5 percent to 5,199.10. Stock benchmarks also fell in Taiwan, Singapore and New Zealand while Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines rose.

TURKEY-RUSSIA: The downing by Turkey of a Russian fighter plane that Turkey said had violated its airspace and ignored warnings added further complexity to the crisis in Syria. Russia said Turkey had betrayed it and that jets had not violated Turkish airspace, as NATO worked to reduce tensions at an extraordinary meeting.

THE QUOTE: "An escalation in geopolitical risk is sending a chill through the markets. Traders are opting to sit on the side lines, especially ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday," Stephen Innes, a senior foreign exchange trader for OANDA, said in a commentary.

WALL STREET: Shares were lower for most of the day after a business research group said U.S. consumer confidence had fallen in November. But the Dow Jones industrial average recovered lost ground to edge 0.1 percent higher, gaining 19.51 points to close Tuesday at 17,812.19.
