Error messages say too many people are trying to access the site.\n\nThe health care exchanges went online this week, but a lot of people hoping to sign up for insurance were greeted by wait messages or error messages.\n\nBut Brian Tabor, vice-president of the Indiana Hospital Association, is urging Hoosiers not to get discouraged.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got six months for people to sign up during this open enrollment, and not only that there will be an open enrollment period every year as we move forward,\u201d he says.\n\nTabor has a particular interest in getting the uninsured to sign up for healthcare in the new marketplace. One of the things the Affordable Care Act did was reduce payments to providers \u2013 hospitals being the majority.\n\nIn Indiana the reduction amounts to $4 billion over 10 years. Essentially those dollars are being held to help pay for the uninsured to get coverage.\n\n\u201cSo what we have here is money that would normally flow to hospitals through the Medicare program that is now kind of at risk and its dependent upon people signing up for insurance. So we have a lot riding on people getting signed up as soon as possible,\u201d Tabor says.\n\nPeople who sign up by December 15 will be eligible to receive benefits beginning January 1 but the open enrollment period extends through March 31.\n\nPeople who do not have insurance in 2014 will have to pay a fine of $95 per adult and $47.50 per child.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Officials are hoping Hoosiers won't get discouraged and not sign up for insurance after a rocky start that included a frozen website and online error messages.", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.10", "og": {"site_name": "News - Indiana Public Media", "description": "Officials are hoping Hoosiers won't get discouraged and not sign up for insurance after a rocky start that included a frozen website and online error messages.", "title": "Slow Start To Health Care Exchange, Officials Urge Patience | News - Indiana Public Media", "url": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/slow-start-healthcare-exchange-officials-urge-patience-56516/", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2013/10/system-down_health1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wfiunews", "image": "http://indianapublicmedia.org/news/files/2013/10/system-down_health1.jpg", "description": "Officials are hoping Hoosiers won't get discouraged and not sign up for insurance after a rocky start that included a frozen website and online error messages.", "card": "summary", "title": "Slow Start To Health Care Exchange, Officials Urge Patience"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160118390716029}, "bitly-verification": "f9ab3b0a7f0c", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=yes,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0a84\"", "article_summary": "People who sign up by December 15 will be eligible to receive benefits beginning January 1 but the open enrollment period extends through March 31.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got six months for people to sign up during this open enrollment, and not only that there will be an open enrollment period every year as we move forward,\u201d he says.\nThe health care exchanges went online this week, but a lot of people hoping to sign up for insurance were greeted by wait messages or error messages.\nTabor has a particular interest in getting the uninsured to sign up for healthcare in the new marketplace.\nPeople who do not have insurance in 2014 will have to pay a fine of $95 per adult and $47.50 per child."}
