MacArthur until last year was the mayor of Randolph, in Morris County.\n\nMacArthur poured more than $2 million into the race from his own pocket and drastically outspent Lonegan.\n\nThis was the sixth unsuccessful run for state or federal office by Lonegan, who served as mayor of Bogota in Bergen County for 12 years. Just last year, he ran unsuccessfully against Cory Booker for U.S. Senate.\n\nThe race was one of the most hotly contested in the state this year, and by far the nastiest. Lonegan at one point called MacArthur a \u201cmonster\u201d over allegations that his insurance company played a part in shortchanging California wildfire victims, while MacArthur characterized Lonegan as bitter.\n\nMacArthur in November will face Democrat Aimee Belgard, who easily prevailed in her party\u2019s primary.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\n\u2022 North Jersey's Lonegan, MacArthur duke it out in South Jersey congressional race\n\n\u2022 More Politics\n\n\n\n\n\n", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Matt Friedman | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com", "medium": "news", "news_keywords": "2014-congressional-races, 2014-election-us-house, 2014-elections, steve-lonegan, news", "title": "3rd congressional district: MacArthur beats Lonegan for Republican nomination", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "Steve Lonegan, a conservative firebrand who ran a heated primary against MacArthur, has conceded.", "title": "3rd congressional district: MacArthur beats Lonegan for Republican nomination", "url": "http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/06/macarthur_lonegan_3rd_district_republican_nomination.html", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/15063193-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Steve Lonegan, a conservative firebrand who ran a heated primary against MacArthur, has conceded.", "title": "3rd congressional district: MacArthur beats Lonegan for Republican nomination", "image": "http://image.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/politics_impact/photo/15063193-standard.jpg", "creator": "@MattFriedmanSL", "site": "@njdotcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article_date_updated": "Tuesday, June 03, 2014, 11:30 PM", "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Tuesday, June 03, 2014,  9:32 PM", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "Description": "Steve Lonegan, a conservative firebrand who ran a heated primary against MacArthur, has conceded."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde076\"", "article_summary": "In his victory speech tonight, MacArthur thanked Lonegan and his supporters \u201cfor a hard-fought race.\u201d\u201cI pledge today to be a different kind of Congressman,\u201d MacArthur said.\nTRENTON \u2014 Tom MacArthur, a millionaire former insurance executive, will be the Republican nominee in South Jersey\u2019s 3rd Congressional District.\nRELATED COVERAGE\u2022 North Jersey's Lonegan, MacArthur duke it out in South Jersey congressional race\u2022 More Politics\nHe beat Steve Lonegan, a conservative firebrand who ran a heated primary against MacArthur, according to projections by the Associated Press.\nLonegan at one point called MacArthur a \u201cmonster\u201d over allegations that his insurance company played a part in shortchanging California wildfire victims, while MacArthur characterized Lonegan as bitter."}
