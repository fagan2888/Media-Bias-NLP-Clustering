Several circuit judges have written eloquent dissents, they say, and the justices have required circuit courts to reconsider earlier decisions in line with the Hobby Lobby opinion, giving them hope.\n\n\u201cIt is not surprising that our arguments in this case \u2014 especially in the face of \u2018accommodations\u2019 by the government \u2014 will not be immediately evident or easy to understand, and this accounts for many negative decisions at the start of this process,\u201d said Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, a pro-life ministry that is appealing to the Supreme Court after losing its case before the D.C. Circuit.\n\n\u201cBut the arguments are cogent,\u201d he said, \u201cand are very consistent with federal law and the American tradition regarding religious freedom.\u201d\n\nThe nonprofits say the administration is using their health plans as a conduit for providing contraceptives they object to \u2014their employees still get birth control, it\u2019s just managed and paid for by someone else. The administration argues the nonprofits are like conscientious objectors at wartime who try to block the government from drafting someone else.\n\nIf successful, the push would place the health care law before the justices in yet another term. Besides Hobby Lobby, the court upheld the law\u2019s individual mandate as constitutional in 2012 and shored up its subsidies last month.\n\nWednesday\u2019s opinion against Wheaton came nine days after the Fifth Circuit turned back Baptist universities in Texas who objected to the mandate.\n\n\u201cFour circuits now reject the RFRA argument plaintiffs make here, and no circuit has held to the contrary,\u201d Justice Department attorneys said in a memo referring to the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993, which corporations relied on to win Hobby Lobby.\n\nThey wanted the 10th Circuit, which is mulling a case brought by the Little Sisters of the Poor, an elder-care charity run by nuns, to know about their Fifth Circuit win.\n\nHolly Lynch, a bioethics expert at Harvard Law School who has tracked the debate, said circuit courts don\u2019t necessarily take their cues from each other.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we get splits,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, it is plausible to think that a judge is more likely to be swayed by an argument she or he knows that other judges have found legally persuasive \u2014 even more so if they know that lots of other judges have found the same way.\u201d\n\nShe feels the Supreme Court ultimately will take up one of the cases, even without a circuit split. However, she thinks the justices will be swayed by the accommodation and side with the administration.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Religious nonprofits hoping to force yet another Obamacare showdown before the Supreme Court haven't chalked up the appellate win they need to put the issue on a glide path to the justices, but they aren't losing faith, saying it's only a matter of time before their legal campaign pays off.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Religious nonprofits hoping to force yet another Obamacare showdown before the Supreme Court haven\u2019t chalked up the appellate win they need to put the issue on a glide path to the justices, but they aren\u2019t losing faith, saying it\u2019s only a matter of time before their legal campaign pays off.", "title": "Religious nonprofits not losing faith after latest failed Obamacare birth control mandate appeal", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jul/2/religious-nonprofits-not-losing-faith-after-latest/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/15/birth-control.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/07/15/birth-control.jpg", "title": "Religious nonprofits not losing faith after latest failed Obamacare bi", "description": "Religious nonprofits hoping to force yet another Obamacare showdown before the Supreme Court haven't chalked up the appellate win they need to put the issue on a glide path to the justices, but they a", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Law Crime, Supreme Court, US Court Of Appeals, Wheaton College"}, "article_summary": "They wanted the 10th Circuit, which is mulling a case brought by the Little Sisters of the Poor, an elder-care charity run by nuns, to know about their Fifth Circuit win.\nBesides Hobby Lobby, the court upheld the law\u2019s individual mandate as constitutional in 2012 and shored up its subsidies last month.\nWednesday\u2019s opinion against Wheaton came nine days after the Fifth Circuit turned back Baptist universities in Texas who objected to the mandate.\nThe administration argues the nonprofits are like conscientious objectors at wartime who try to block the government from drafting someone else.\nSeveral circuit judges have written eloquent dissents, they say, and the justices have required circuit courts to reconsider earlier decisions in line with the Hobby Lobby opinion, giving them hope."}
