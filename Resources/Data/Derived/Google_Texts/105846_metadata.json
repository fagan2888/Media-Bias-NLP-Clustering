A 2-year-old mutt named Peanut, whose wild white and brown hair, bulging eyes and protruding teeth belie his sweet, energetic personality.\n\nAlthough Peanut is healthy now, his owner, Holly Chandler of Greenville, N.C., said the dog was seriously burned as a puppy, resulting in bald patches all over his body. Chandler said she hopes Peanut\u2019s victory will help raise awareness about animal abuse.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to use him as a poster child for what can happen to animals who are abused,\u201d she said.\n\nShe plans to use the $1,500 prize to pay for other animals\u2019 veterinary bills.\n\nThe contest, held at the Sonoma-Marin Fairgrounds in Petaluma, Calif., is in its 26th year. Past winners have included a duck-footed beagle-boxer-basset hound mix with a waddle and a Chinese crested-Chihuahua mix with a protruding tongue.
