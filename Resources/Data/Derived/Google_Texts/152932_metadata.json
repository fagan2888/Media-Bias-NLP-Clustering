Still, they were nervous before their turn.\n\nThey watched videos from other races online to psych themselves up for the event, Starr said.\n\n\u201cBut I think the videos made it worse,\u201d Fisher said.\n\nThe idea to bring the race to Tampa was planted two years ago, organizers said, during International Special Operations Forces Week, when commandos from nine countries put on a capabilities demonstration that included \u201cfreeing\u201d Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn who was \u201ctaken hostage\u201d by \u201cviolent extremists.\u201d The event drew thousands of people to downtown Tampa.\n\nBuckhorn officiated the race\u2019s opening ceremony Saturday, which included paratroopers and a speech from Socom\u2019s commander, Adm. William McRaven.\n\nA portion of the entry fees, which ranged from $75 to $100 depending on sign-up date, will go to military-related charities, organizers said.\n\nSpartan races are intense, but they are safe and \u201cextremely well-run,\u201d said Kurt Huebschman, 44.\n\nHe was visiting family members in Orlando, down from his home in Pennsylvania, where he ran his first Spartan race. He and his brother-in-law are running a half-marathon at Disney World next weekend and wanted to run the Spartan course at Raymond James, too.\n\n\u201cThis was my Christmas present,\u201d he said.\n\nEbehrman@Tampatrib.com\n\n(813)259-7691\n\nTwitter: @LizBehrmanTBO", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Sat, 15 Feb 2014 21:01:03 -0400", "Description": "TAMPA \u2014 Even those who came just to watch the Special Ops Spartan Sprint had to sign a waiver.", "og": {"site_name": "TBO.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Even those who came just to watch the Special Ops Spartan Sprint had to sign a waiver.", "title": "Tampa\u2019s first \u2018Spartan Sprint\u2019 challenge draws thousands", "url": "http://www.tbo.com/events/tampas-first-spartan-sprint-challenge-draws-thousands-20140215/", "image": {"width": 627, "identifier": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140215/ARTICLE/140219433/EP/1/3/EP-140219433.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2014-02-15T23:24:00Z-04", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "tbo.com", "description": "TAMPA \u2014 Even those who came just to watch the Special Ops Spartan Sprint had to sign a waiver.", "title": "Tampa\u2019s first \u2018Spartan Sprint\u2019 challenge draws thousands", "image": "http://www.tbo.com/storyimage/TB/20140215/ARTICLE/140219433/AR/0/AR-140219433.jpg", "site": "@TBOcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"app_id": 522234267826834}, "msvalidate.01": "29E67031F86E7FB6DF9823924E21B8B4", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tbocom", "published_time": "2014-02-15T21:01:03Z-04", "modified_time": "2014-02-15T23:24:00Z-04"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "He was visiting family members in Orlando, down from his home in Pennsylvania, where he ran his first Spartan race.\nNeither of them had run a Spartan race before, but they found a good discount on Groupon and decided to try it.\nSpartan races are intense, but they are safe and \u201cextremely well-run,\u201d said Kurt Huebschman, 44.\nHe and his brother-in-law are running a half-marathon at Disney World next weekend and wanted to run the Spartan course at Raymond James, too.\nIt was Tampa\u2019s first Spartan race, an internationally renowned competition in which participants scale 8-foot-high walls, crawl through mud under barbed wire and jump over pits of fire."}
