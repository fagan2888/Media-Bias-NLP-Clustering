Lynn Haven is getting a head start on the holidays this year with its Winter Wonderland festival.

Shoppers headed to Sharon Sheffield Park where they could start their holiday shopping.

People could check out more than 70 vendors at the park selling everything from clothes to holiday trinkets.

Many of the booths showcase local businesses including handmade snow globes, bath products and more.

While shoppers searched for special gifts, many artists and dancers provided live entertainment.

"It's a good time of year to be thankful this coming Thursday for what we have and also to give joy and peace to others and give people something to laugh about and smile about," said Dancing Divas Member Rita Miller.

This is the eight year for the Dancing Divas to be a part of the Winter Wonderland festival. Members said every year it's a great way to get kids and families excited for the holidays.
