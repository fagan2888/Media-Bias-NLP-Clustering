(Mark Gormus/AP)\n\nSome of the activists who helped launch Terry McAuliffe to victory in November sound as though they\u2019re not savoring the big win in the Virginia gubernatorial election as much as they are working through the stages of grief.\n\n\u201cYou just have to move on, accept it,\u201d said Katherine Waddell, a Republican who backed McAuliffe (D) largely because of his support for abortion rights. \u201cYou believe in the governor and what he said. And you move on.\u201d\n\nWaddell was referring to McAuliffe\u2019s decision to reappoint Republican Gov. Robert F. McDonnell\u2019s health and human resources secretary, William Hazel. Some abortion rights activists have bristled over McAuliffe\u2019s choice because Hazel did not object to strict new abortion limits enacted during McDonnell\u2019s term.\n\nSome environmental activists feel similarly jilted because of McAuliffe\u2019s choice for natural resources secretary \u2014 former Hampton mayor Molly Joseph Ward. And environmentalists and smart-growth advocates feel a bit burned by McAuliffe\u2019s decision to name Hampton Roads businessman Aubrey Layne as his transportation secretary.\n\nBut now that McAuliffe has finished assembling his Cabinet, those groups are looking ahead to the General Assembly session and beyond to try to ensure that the new governor doesn\u2019t compromise on their key issues, as they think he did in choosing his key advisers.\n\nMcAuliffe promised during the campaign to govern as a pragmatic dealmaker, someone willing to reach across the aisle in a divided General Assembly to make things happen. For his Cabinet, he picked veterans of Democratic and Republican administrations.\n\n\u201cThe governor-elect was very clear from the get-go in terms of what criteria he would apply: find the best people for the job,\u201d spokesman Brian Coy said.\n\nBut McAuliffe\u2019s campaign was also fueled by passionate advocates for particular causes. Environmental groups gave $3.8 million to his bid, according to the Virginia Public Access Project \u2014 more than double the $1.8 million donated by the real estate and construction industry, with whom they often are at odds.\n\nAbortion rights groups gave $1.8 million, coming in second to environmentalists among single-issue groups.\n\nWaddell, a former state delegate who ran in 2005 as an independent but describes herself as a \u201cpro-choice Republican,\u201d is co-founder of Women\u2019s Strike Force, which supports candidates backing abortion rights. McAuliffe featured her many times during the campaign as a Republican drawn to him because of his stance on the issue. He vowed at the time to be a \u201cbrick wall\u201d against what he called the GOP\u2019s \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\nShe objected to Hazel\u2019s reappointment because he did not publicly oppose the imposition of strict new building codes on abortion clinics or a bill that, before it was amended, would have required a vaginal ultrasound before an abortion. Waddell and other abortion rights activists said their concern about Hazel is about symbolism, not a fear that he would push abortion restrictions under McAuliffe.\n\n\u201cMy problem with his reappointment was, I wanted someone as secretary of health and human resources who was as passionate as the women who worked for him [McAuliffe] and supported him about reproductive health care,\u201d Waddell said. \u201cThat obviously is not Dr. Hazel. . . . I was a little worried about that sending the wrong message to the women who supported him.\u201d\n\nYet Waddell said she understands McAuliffe\u2019s reasoning for keeping Hazel, a widely respected health-policy expert who might be able to persuade some Republicans to expand Medicaid under the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cI understand where he\u2019s coming from, too,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to walk that line of getting Medicaid expansion while at the same time letting women know that he himself is the one who\u2019s passionate about women\u2019s reproductive health care.\u201d\n\nEnvironmentalists do not object to any particular action Ward took as mayor. But they are disappointed that McAuliffe passed up other candidates whose professional background and political sympathies are more closely tied to the green movement.\n\n\u201cThere were a number of choices where he could have made more liberal selections,\u201d said Stephen J. Farnsworth, a University of Mary Washington political scientist.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that McAuliffe was very clear in the campaign that he was going to try to compromise and he\u2019s going to try to make the deal. I think sometimes activists are overly optimistic before an election, and the realities of governing can get in the way of the idealistic vision of some of the people who work hardest in campaigns. It\u2019s a painful reality for Democrats and Republicans alike as divided government requires compromise.\u201d\n\nLayne, a member of the Commonwealth Transportation Board, has worked on several large transportation projects that these advocates oppose, including the building of a 55-mile, $1.4 billion toll road running along U.S. 460 between Petersburg and Suffolk.\n\nThe governor has broad power over transportation funding, and environmentalists are concerned that projects be evaluated with their priorities in mind.\n\nThe choice of Layne is \u201cnot encouraging,\u201d said Chris Miller of the Piedmont Environmental Council, and some supporters have spoken with McAuliffe about their displeasure. The difference, he said, is that the incoming administration has been very receptive to their concerns.\n\n\u201cHe is very interested in hearing from all points of view,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThe question which nobody knows is where that process will turn out.\u201d\n\nGlen Besa, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s Virginia chapter, said he understands McAuliffe\u2019s pragmatic approach. He thinks the governor is wise to appoint middle-of-the-road Cabinet secretaries who won\u2019t turn off the Republicans he\u2019ll need to get anything done. Republicans dominate the House and may take control of the evenly divided Senate after special elections to fill two vacancies.\n\n\u201cComing from where we were, with a governor and attorney general who denied climate change, we\u2019re optimistic that this governor\u2019s going to allow us to make progress in these areas,\u201d Besa said. \u201cBut to make progress, he\u2019s going to have to work with Republicans in the legislature. \u201d\n\nSome Republicans see McAuliffe\u2019s pragmatic appointments as a positive sign.\n\n\u201cAt least he\u2019s gone to people who know what the heck they\u2019re doing, so I have to give him credit,\u201d said state Sen. John C. Watkins (R-Chesterfield). Hazel is one of three holdovers from the McDonnell administration. The others are Finance Secretary Richard D. Brown and Agriculture and Forestry Secretary Todd Haymore.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone to people that actually know the issues, know how state government works, and he\u2019s brought them on,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cThat goes a long way with me.\u201d\n\nWatkins, a nurseryman, said that colleagues in his industry were especially pleased with Haymore\u2019s reappointment.\n\n\u201cI think Terry McAuliffe wasn\u2019t high on the list for a lot of people in agriculture, but he put his best foot forward there,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cI think that\u2019s an overture in the right direction.\u201d\n\nWilliam Galston, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton who now is at the Brookings Institution, said McAuliffe will have to walk a fine line.\n\n\u201cFor every deal that he makes with Republicans, he\u2019s probably going to have to balance it with a red meat proposal that will convince the base that he\u2019s doing his best to honor his campaign promises,\u201d Galston said. \u201cI think his strategy at this point is pretty clear; whether the base will let him act on it is an open question.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Abortion rights and environmental activists are worried about his appointment of McDonnell holdovers.", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/rachel.elise.weiner", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Abortion rights and environmental activists are worried about his appointment of McDonnell holdovers.", "title": "Left flank upset with Va.
