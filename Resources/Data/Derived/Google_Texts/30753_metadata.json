Third St. was known as Plan B, Club Oasis and Utopia.\n\nBut from the late '90s to 2001, live-music fans and folks who pined for a return of downtown entertainment called it The Fur Shop.\n\n\"For pizza and $50, we got some good bands,\" Nelson B. Rogers said with a smile.\n\nRogers and his brother, Steve, plus business partner Mike Aston operated The Fur Shop. The building itself is presently owned by David Sharp.\n\nNow, more than 10 years after the last act graced its outdoor stage, The Fur Shop will open again \u0097 this time with entrepreneur and Tulsa City Councilor Blake Ewing at the helm.\n\n\"It celebrated downtown before downtown was really celebrated,\" Ewing said of his newest venture, which he plans to have open by the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.\n\nLong before it was ever a bar, the building was the Midland Valley Train Depot, said Ewing, who recently leased the space from Sharp.\n\nAlthough he was too young at the time to enter the bar, Ewing remembers The Fur Shop's heyday. Not much in the way of nightlife was available in those days, and The Fur Shop provided a fun downtown venue for live music, from local acts to nationally acclaimed talent.\n\nAs development in this part of downtown has increased, Ewing has been excited to see what's happening to the neighborhood.\n\nThis summer, he and his Blue Ox Dining Group opened Legends Dance Hall & Saloon at 514 E. Second St., where he found the old sign for The Fur Shop \u0097 a neon from a fur-storage facility that served as the bar's namesake.\n\nNow, following Ewing's lease of the site, the big sign \u0097 bulb-less but carved with dozens of names, perhaps those of customers or musicians \u0097 leans against the bar's west wall.\n\nAnd it'll stay inside, as Ewing eventually will get a new sign for The Fur Shop, he said.\n\nOther than some modest infrastructure repair, such as wiring and plumbing, the space was move-in ready, with interior decorating the main task ahead, Ewing said.\n\n\"This will be a little more ragtag than The Phoenix,\" he said of his cafe and bar at Sixth Street and Peoria Avenue.\n\nAmple space outside will make for a great patio area, which downtown is kind of lacking, Ewing said.\n\nThe big outdoor stage on the building's south side is in good shape and will accommodate acts, weather permitting. A smaller stage inside will be utilized, too. Upstairs, he's thinking about a pool table or two.\n\nHe's even thought ahead to spring, when he might have a food truck outside.\n\n\"It's like the poor man's Guthrie Green,\" he said, chuckling.\n\n\"I want Tulsa to be a place where young, creative people feel wanted,\" said Ewing, who envisions The Fur Shop catering to both the creative, artistic community as well as those in downtown service jobs or friends meeting for drinks after work.\n\nSummed up more succinctly, it'll be a true neighborhood bar, Ewing said.\n\nAnd Rogers couldn't be happier that Ewing has leased it.\n\n\"There was always something exciting (here),\" Rogers said. \"It was a good thing.\"", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "og": {"site_name": "Tulsa World", "description": "It played host to musical acts like Chainsaw Kittens, Billy Joe Winghead and the late Ronnie Dawson.", "title": "Former Fur Shop club dusted off for reopening", "url": "http://www.tulsaworld.com/scene/music/former-fur-shop-club-dusted-off-for-reopening/article_3e490a48-9e4b-5401-86ec-221071685125.html", "image": "http://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/tulsaworld.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/d3/ad3ede51-6a43-5d9d-a091-91458a47e33e/5275f630c61c6.preview-500.jpg?resize=500%2C336", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tulsaworld", "card": "summary"}, "description": "It played host to musical acts like Chainsaw Kittens, Billy Joe Winghead and the late Ronnie Dawson.", "fb": {"app_id": 288003941350366}, "keywords": "ewing,building,fur,downtown,shop,celebrated,bar,tulsa,rogers,blake,music,scene,scenehomepage2", "news_keywords": "ewing,building,fur,downtown,shop,celebrated,bar,tulsa,rogers,blake,music,scene,scenehomepage2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb8fc\"", "article_summary": "Rogers and his brother, Steve, plus business partner Mike Aston operated The Fur Shop.\nAnd it'll stay inside, as Ewing eventually will get a new sign for The Fur Shop, he said.\nBut from the late '90s to 2001, live-music fans and folks who pined for a return of downtown entertainment called it The Fur Shop.\nAlthough he was too young at the time to enter the bar, Ewing remembers The Fur Shop's heyday.\nSummed up more succinctly, it'll be a true neighborhood bar, Ewing said."}
