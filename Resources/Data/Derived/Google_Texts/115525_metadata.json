Female. Transgender. The universal symbols make a statement about the best- and least-known aspects of the reproductive health care agency.\n\nPlanned Parenthood is best known for female reproductive health care, mainly comprehensive birth control services and testing for sexually-transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nMen make up about nine percent of patients at the Peoria health center. Men can go to Planned Parenthood for HIV and STI testing, pills to prevent HIV, screenings for testicular cancer, erectile dysfunction, or simply to buy condoms. Some Planned Parenthood agencies, though not Peoria\u2019s, perform vasectomies.\n\nJudging from national reports, the national organization is always on the defensive about what it does and what it doesn\u2019t do \u2014 at least what it doesn\u2019t do much.\n\nWhen Planned Parenthood isn\u2019t fending off political, legal, or violent attacks such as the November shootings in Colorado Springs, it\u2019s defending Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion 43 years ago this week.\n\nBut Planned Parenthood of Illinois is forging through the controversies, steadily expanding services and moving ahead with ambitious makeovers of the organization\u2019s 17 health centers in Illinois. The national organization will celebrate its 100th anniversary this year.\n\nCarole Brite sums up the situation with a saying familiar to Planned Parenthood staff and supporters:\n\n\u201cThese doors stay open.\u201d\n\nNot only are the doors open, the agency is considering opening new offices near Chicago and in southern Illinois. The Peoria health center just moved from its longtime location along Jefferson Street to a renovated medical office at 2709 N. Knoxville. In the past three years, the agency has spent more than $3.6 million to update Planned Parenthood clinics throughout the state. Brite\u2019s plans include renovations at all 17 Planned Parenthood sites in Illinois.\n\nThe new Peoria clinic is centrally located with more parking, and more exam rooms, says Tammy Garrott, regional director of clinical operations who oversees seven Planned Parenthood centers in downstate Illinois, including Peoria.\n\nThe office offers free wi-fi and charging stations for telephones and tablets. \u201cWe know how connected people are to their phones,\u201d Garrott says.\n\nPlanned Parenthood also uses a phone service that can translate 36 different languages for non-English speaking clients.\n\nOne employee is trained to help people sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, which will play a role in whether or not the agency decides to offer limited primary care services in the future.\n\nBrite gives part of the credit for Planned Parenthood\u2019s progressive plans to the state\u2019s political climate.\n\n\u201cHere in Illinois, we\u2019re somewhat of an oasis,\u201d she explains. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a lot of laws restricting access to health care. At the same time, we can use the opportunity to serve women, teens and men where services are needed most.\u201d\n\nPam Adams can be reached at 686-3245 or padams@pjstar.com.\n\n___\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Illinois \u2014 Peoria facts, 2015\n\nTotal patients: 3,138 Total patient visits: 6,132 Visits for contraceptives: 4,146 Testing for sexually-transmitted infections: 2,001 Pregnancy tests: 1,220 Cancer screenings (including breast exams): 440 Planned Parenthood of Illinois \u2014 Peoria patient demographics\n\nAge:\n\n18 or younger: 13 percent 19 to 29: 60 percent 30 and older: 27 percent Race:\n\nWhite: 60 percent Black: 35 percent Hispanic or Latino: 5 percent ___\n\nCarole Brite, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Illinois on:\n\n\u2022 The videotapes released by Center for Medical Progress that purported to show Planned Parenthood officials involved in the illegal sale of baby parts:\n\n\u201cThis was a smear campaign over the summer. Our supporters know that.\u201d\n\n(Planned Parenthood has filed a federal lawsuit against the activists who produced the videos.)\n\n\u2022 Efforts to defund Planned Parenthood:\n\n\u201cWhen they were talking about defunding Planned Parenthood, mostly they\u2019re singling out Title X and in some cases taking away Medicaid. . .They\u2019re really attacking the most vulnerable populations, the ones that don\u2019t have access to health care.\u201d\n\n(Title X is federal funding for comprehensive family planning for women who don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid, such as undocumented immigrants.)\n\n\u2022 On abortion, which makes up less than 10 percent of services at Planned Parenthood:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to know our main service is not abortion. Our main service is providing well-woman exams and birth control, all FDA approved, and STI and HIV screenings. Really, only a small portion of our services are abortion services.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably the organization working hardest to make sure women don\u2019t have unintended pregnancies so they don\u2019t need abortions.\u201d\n\n(Abortions are not available at the Peoria clinic. The agency is considering offering medical abortions, or the abortion pill, to end early-stage pregnancies.)\n\n\u2022 On the shooting that left three dead at a Planned Parenthood in Colorado Springs:\n\n\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know it but Planned Parenthood staff in Colorado Springs saved many lives that day. They were able to get patients and guests away from the shooter in a very timely fashion.\n\n\u201cStaff at all Planned Parenthoods have the same training . . . I have to give a shout-out to our staff. The Monday after Colorado Springs, all of our staff showed up to work in Peoria and throughout the state.\u201d\n\n\u2022 On why she\u2019s involved with Planned Parenthood:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m personally committed to this work. I come to work everyday because I have a 14-year-old daughter. I don\u2019t want her to lose any of the rights we currently have. Really, I do the work for her and future generations.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "PEORIA \u2014 An all-gender logo above the restroom door of the new Planned Parenthood office along Knoxville Avenue draws attention immediately.\r\nMale.
