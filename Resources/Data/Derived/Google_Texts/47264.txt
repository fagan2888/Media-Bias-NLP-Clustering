BOISE -- Your Health Idaho's executive director says more than 102,000 Idahoans are currently enrolled in health insurance plans on the state-based exchange, making Idaho second in the nation for per capita enrollments.



Pat Kelly announced the record-breaking numbers Tuesday. First-time enrollees made up roughly a third of total enrollment.



According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, only Florida's per capita enrollment figures were higher than Idaho.



The exchange is part of the Affordable Care Act. Idaho was one of a dozen states, as well as the only Republican-dominated state, to launch its own exchange in 2014.



Idaho's exchange enrollment period ended Feb. 15.
