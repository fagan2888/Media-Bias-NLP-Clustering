Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas has earned a singular honor once reserved for movie villains, according to a Friday story on Breitbart TV. Bill Maher laid into the possible Republican presidential candidates on his HBO political rant show. He had little good to say about any of them, but he reserved a special sort of ire, on the level of what he has used for Sarah Palin, for Cruz. Putting it simply, the bad boy of pay for view cable is deathly afraid of the junior senator from Texas.

Maher minced no words about how terrified he is about Cruz. “Maher then turned to Ted Cruz, who he said was ‘a real a**hole’ who ‘oozed down from Canada,’ was ‘the scariest Hispanic to come out of [Texas] since Javier Bardem in No Country for Old Men,' and is “what you’d get if Ayn Rand had half a sex-change and moved to Waco.”

Javier Bardem is an actor who hails from Spain and is most famous for playing a psychotic murderer in the before mentioned movie. However, his politics could not be more different that Cruz’s. He recently got himself in hot water for signing an open letter stating that Israel’s campaign against the Hamas terrorist state in Gaza was “genocide.” Cruz, on the other hand, is a warm supporter of the state of Israel.

What political fallout that Maher's confession might create will likely redound to the benefit of Senator Cruz. Cruz’s voting base, if they are aware of Maher at all, regard him as pond scum. Now, if only Vladimir Putin would confess how the prospect of President Cruz keeps him awake at night, the senator from Texas will find his political fortunes in the ascendance.
