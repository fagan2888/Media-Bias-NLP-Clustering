These were not the scrappy little English chickens of the day, but enormous regal creatures carried to Britain by a naval officer returning from the Opium War in China. Victoria was entranced. She hired a royal poultry keeper and ordered a luxurious aviary built to house the exotic birds, which included a private apartment where she and her new husband, Prince Albert, could watch the fowl cavort on the pebbled paths.\n\nMarco Polo in the 13th century described huge Chinese chickens with hair like cats that laid massive eggs, but these stories were dismissed as fairy tales. As the West forced China to open its markets, the appearance of such birds in Victorian Britain sparked a frenzy of collecting among the queen\u2019s subjects. It was called, simply, \u201cThe Fancy.\u201d A single bird could sell for the equivalent of $10,000 today. Like Holland\u2019s 17th-century tulip mania, the wild speculation inflated a bubble that soon burst. But unlike tulip mania, the peculiar fad continues to affect the lives of billions of people every day. Victoria\u2019s obsession led to the creation of what is now humanity\u2019s single most important source of protein, the modern chicken.\n\nToday it is the world\u2019s most ubiquitous bird\u2014there are more than 20 billion at any given time on Earth\u2013and its meat and eggs are an essential element in the global food chain. In the land of the hamburger, Americans now eat more chicken than beef. The rest of the world is quickly copying our way of mass-producing chicken meat and eggs to feed the hungry millions in burgeoning cities from Latin America and Africa to China.\n\nThroughout most of history, however, chicken was not synonymous with a meal. In the West, it first was a treasured creature fit only for kings. Four millennia ago, traders from the Indus River civilization in what today includes Pakistan and western India brought the domesticated bird to Ur, the cosmopolitan city in Mesopotamia. Ur, legendary home to Abraham, was the largest and wealthiest urban center on Earth. The ruler kept the chicken or a statue of its likeness in his palace menagerie, the world\u2019s first recorded zoo. Five hundred years later, Egyptian pharaoh Thutmose III invaded what is now Syria and Iraq. Among the booty he brought back were birds said to lay eggs every day\u2014a likely reference to the chicken. Our earliest likeness of the bird is a charming 3,000-year-old drawing on a piece of pottery found in Egypt\u2019s Valley of the Kings.\n\nA thousand years later, ancient Persians and classical Greeks alike considered the chicken sacred to the gods, a link between heaven and earth. During the days of the Roman Republic, military leaders studied the birds\u2019 behavior to determine if they should go to war or sue for peace, while later Christians placed it on top of their churches. Chickens were also veritable two-legged medicine chests, their various parts capable of curing everything from bedwetting to burns. And from Confucian China to today\u2019s Appalachia, men used it for cockfighting\u2014perhaps the world\u2019s oldest sport after boxing. For millennia, the bird symbolized everything from spiritual awakening to sexual prowess. There is no other animal that has served humans in so many versatile ways.\n\nBut cheap chicken was not on the day-to-day menu of early Victorian Britain. When the Asian fowl arrived, the British bird was more expensive and less desirable than beef, pork, or even goose and turkey. \u201cPeople of narrow income, if living in town, can seldom afford to put any on their table,\u201d one contemporary noted. Bob Cratchit bought the economical goose, while the repentant Scrooge in Dickens\u2019 1843 \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d sought the prize turkey. London by then had surpassed Beijing as the world\u2019s largest city. Strikes and revolts by workers protesting wage cuts and the rising cost of basic staples shook the government.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The invention of the modern chicken helped make a 7-billion-person planet possible \u2014\u00a0but at a staggering cost", "author": "Andrew Lawler", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "The invention of the modern chicken helped make a 7-billion-person planet possible \u2014\u00a0but at a staggering cost", "title": "The bird that flipped the world: Secret histories of the modern chicken", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/12/06/the_bird_that_flipped_the_world_secret_histories_of_the_modern_chicken/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/chickens.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The invention of the modern chicken helped make a 7-billion-person planet possible \u2014\u00a0but at a staggering cost", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/12/chickens.jpg", "title": "The bird that flipped the world: Secret histories of the modern chicken", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "The bird that flipped the world: Secret histories of the modern chicken", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, chicken, Editor's Picks, Food, History, meat, poultry", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1c77\"", "article_summary": "Victoria\u2019s obsession led to the creation of what is now humanity\u2019s single most important source of protein, the modern chicken.\nThe rest of the world is quickly copying our way of mass-producing chicken meat and eggs to feed the hungry millions in burgeoning cities from Latin America and Africa to China.\nAmong the booty he brought back were birds said to lay eggs every day\u2014a likely reference to the chicken.\nThe ruler kept the chicken or a statue of its likeness in his palace menagerie, the world\u2019s first recorded zoo.\nIt was called, simply, \u201cThe Fancy.\u201d A single bird could sell for the equivalent of $10,000 today."}
