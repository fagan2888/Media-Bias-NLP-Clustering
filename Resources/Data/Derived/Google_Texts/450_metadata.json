Without missing a beat, Baxter, a 1994 graduate of the University of Virginia\u2019s School of Nursing, readied warm washcloths, a clean adult diaper and gently set to work, his colleagues staring from the doorway.\n\nCalm. Capable. Compassionate. Tackling burning, house-sized problems alongside smaller ones, like a clean set of undergarments, with poise, ability and humility.\n\n\"That\u2019s the common thread across all these helping professions \u2013 EMTs, police, fire and rescue: the desire to solve that problem, no matter what it is. It\u2019s often difficult, gritty, dangerous work, and they wouldn\u2019t do these jobs unless they really cared.\u201d -- Andrew Baxter, Charlottesville Fire Chief\n\nBacked by more than two decades as a nurse and firefighter, Baxter\u2019s care mantra is guided both by his first fire chief\u2019s refrain \u2013 \u201cthe citizen defines the emergency\u201d \u2013 with equal parts empathy and compassion stirred in, as well as the knowledge that small kindnesses matter profoundly.\n\n\u201cThe feedback I get, the cards, e-mails and calls, very rarely is it a technical\u201d skill that citizens are lauding, Baxter said. \u201cNo one says to you, \u2018The way you rolled out that 200 feet of hose was astonishing.\u2019 No. They say, \u2018I was touched by what the firefighters did, with how they treated me.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s his role as chief, he explains: to help service professionals understand the importance of \u201cdoing those things that are beyond the job description.\u201d\n\nThe clarity of his professional approach today belies his rather accidental discovery of nursing as a 20-something. When Baxter \u2013 who, last September, became the city\u2019s first fire chief who is also a nurse \u2013 arrived in Charlottesville in 1990, out of money and with two years of college under his belt, he applied for two jobs: one on the \u201cweight and lift team\u201d at UVA Medical Center, a sort of nursing assistant, and the other as a parking attendant.\n\nFate intervened, Baxter laughed, because \u201cthe weight and lift lady called me first.\u201d\n\nIt was the job that changed everything. Shortly afterward, he enrolled in UVA\u2019s School of Nursing\u2019s undergraduate program, volunteering with the Charlottesville-Albemarle Rescue Squad when not in class or practicum, ultimately becoming an intensive care nurse at UVA Medical Center in 1994. There he met his future wife, Barbara Baxter, then a nurse in the thoracic-cardiovascular intensive care unit. They had a daughter, Katherine, in 1997, and a son, Peter, in 1998, and the Baxters settled into small-town life until a position with Henrico County Division of Fire sparked his interest \u2013 and an offer.\n\nHe spent the next 20 years commuting back and forth to Richmond, assuming roles of increasing responsibility before ultimately becoming an assistant fire chief in 2012.\n\nToday, Baxter\u2019s at the helm of the Charlottesville Fire Department\u2019s three-station, 91-member fire service team that each year responds to more than 5,600 emergency calls of nearly infinite variety, nearly two-thirds of which are non-fire-related. These days, he says, with the Affordable Care Act and accountable care organizations in place, firefighters and other emergency personnel across the country offering a new brand of primary care, addressing problems before they become acute, the critical set of eyes and ears between medicine, nursing, social services and a citizen in need.\n\nIn his early days as fire chief, he\u2019s sharpened his focus on empathy and partnerships. Officers\u2019 behavioral-expectations meetings focus not just on firefighting skills, but on demeanor and relationship-building. He\u2019s invited UVA nursing students to practice their assessment skills by monitoring firefighters\u2019 vital signs during practice burns, and he plans a series of workshops in partnership with UVA nursing faculty about stress first aid for emergency personnel.\n\nBut he\u2019s got a lot to work with, he said, and is proud of a \u201ctalented\u201d staff.\n\n\u201cOur guys get it,\u201d Baxter said, \u201cand that\u2019s the common thread across all these helping professions \u2013 EMTs, police, fire and rescue: the desire to solve that problem, no matter what it is. It\u2019s often difficult, gritty, dangerous work, and they wouldn\u2019t do these jobs unless they really cared.\u201d\n\nWith so many nurses in the mix \u2013 including daughter Kate, a first-year UVA nursing student, and wife Barb, a veteran RN, School of Nursing master\u2019s student and part of UVA Medical Center\u2019s 10-member Medical Emergency Team \u2013 dinner-table talk at the Baxters\u2019 house is livelier than ever.\n\nThat\u2019s just the way Kate \u2013 raised on a steady diet of her parents\u2019 stories and TV hospital dramas like \u201cER\u201d and \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d and who saw her first house fire at age 8 \u2013 likes it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather hear their stories,\u201d she said, \u201cthan ask, \u2018How was working in your office today?\u2019\u201d", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "UVA Today", "description": "Charlottesville\u2019s new fire chief, Andrew Baxter, brings to his new job a UVA nursing education and a commitment to compassionate care and service to the community \u2013 no matter the task.", "title": "Beyond 911: New Fire Chief a Nurse First", "url": "https://news.virginia.edu/content/beyond-911-new-fire-chief-nurse-first", "image": "https://news.virginia.edu/sites/default/files/article_image/fire_fighter.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-16T14:48:46-05:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://news.virginia.edu/content/beyond-911-new-fire-chief-nurse-first", "card": "summary", "title": "Beyond 911: New Fire Chief a Nurse First"}, "fb": {"pages": 12527153330}, "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "article": {"published_time": "2015-12-09T15:05:34-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-16T14:48:46-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "Charlottesville\u2019s new fire chief, Andrew Baxter, knows a thing or two about putting out fires \u2013 including the kind with neither flames nor embers.\nShortly afterward, he enrolled in UVA\u2019s School of Nursing\u2019s undergraduate program, volunteering with the Charlottesville-Albemarle Rescue Squad when not in class or practicum, ultimately becoming an intensive care nurse at UVA Medical Center in 1994.\nThere he met his future wife, Barbara Baxter, then a nurse in the thoracic-cardiovascular intensive care unit.\nLike the time when his fire service team responded to a 911 call at the home of a bedridden, elderly man who was agitated, alone and filthy.\nIn his early days as fire chief, he\u2019s sharpened his focus on empathy and partnerships."}
