Jonathan Ernst / Reuters Sarah Palin delivers remarks to the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md., on March 16, 2013

In commentary published on Saturday by the conservative website Breitbart.com, former Alaska governor and vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin lets loose against Republicans who she sees as too soft in the fight against President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

The political class in Washington, she writes, is “nothing if not gutless and rudderless.” She also suggests the effects of a government shutdown would not be too harmful if the fight over Obamacare funding leads to that.

“Stop the ridiculous hysterics,” she writes. “Heck, about the most significant thing that happened during the last government shutdown was Clinton hooked up with Monica.”

Palin praised Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for his staunch support of defunding Obamacare, even if it leads to a partial government shutdown. She says she and Cruz are among those still in support of putting the brakes on the law’s funding and implementation because it has “made health care completely unaffordable” and that families are losing employer-provided health care coverage because of it.

Next week, House leaders will advance a measure that demands a one-year delay in the Affordable Care Act’s implementation, according to the Washington Post. In return, Republicans would agree to help avert the nation’s first-ever debt default sometime next month.

“Whenever anything bad happens, the media blames Republicans for it,” Palin writes. “That’s not an excuse to roll over and play dead. It’s a call to follow the advice I give my daughters: Woman up, stand your ground, and fight like a girl!”
