Hastings Hospital has joined the \u201cBan the Bag\u201d initiative by agreeing to discontinue the practice of sending new mothers home with commercial formula in discharge bags. The Oklahoma State Department of Health and Maternal and Child Health Service announced Feb. 4 that Hastings and six other hospitals will be taking part to encourage breastfeeding of newborns. With 28 institutions now in the program, half of Oklahoma\u2019s hospitals are participating. \u201cW.W. Hastings Hospital has begun the process of obtaining a \u2018Baby-Friendly\u2019 designation, and as part of our commitment to encourage improved health by breastfeeding, we are implementing the \u2018Ban the Bag\u2019 initiative,\u201d Hastings CEO Brian Hail said. \u201cBy not promoting infant formula in bags of free formula to new mothers, we know we are helping assure the success of our patients\u2019 breastfeeding efforts at home. As an alternative, we are providing our patients with a diaper bag containing the same kinds of items typically included by the formula companies so that we continue to meet our patients\u2019 expectations.\u201d Rhode Island and Massachusetts hospitals voluntarily banned gift bags with formula in 2011 and 2012, respectively, and some U.S. cities are \u201cbag free.\u201d \u201cBan the Bag\u201d is a nationwide effort to increase breastfeeding rates by ending hospital promotion of brand name formulas, which studies indicate reduces breastfeeding rates. Mothers who encounter problems while breastfeeding are more likely to use formula supplied by hospitals than to seek assistance. The OSDH reports that several Oklahoma hospitals encourage breastfeeding through other measures, such as staff training and maximizing contact between mothers and infants, which includes rooming newborns with their mothers. Such measures are credited for increasing Oklahoma\u2019s breastfeeding rates in four of five categories tracked in the Breastfeeding Report Card released annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 2013 study, reporting on babies born in 2010, show that Oklahoma improved from 41st to 25th in exclusive breastfeeding at 3 months of age, and from 45th to 24th at 6 months. Oklahoma also improved in breastfeeding initiation from 39th to 31st and in any breastfeeding at 6 months from 43rd to 38th. \u201cWe are moving in the right direction,\u201d said Dr. Edd Rhoades, interim director of the OSDH Maternal and Child Health Service, in a press release. \u201cIt has taken a desire to improve outcomes and a focused effort at multiple levels. The fact that Oklahoma has its first \u2018Baby-Friendly\u2019 hospital, Claremore Indian Hospital, and that many other hospitals are working to achieve this designation, reflects the recognition that breastfeeding is an important factor in our state\u2019s health.\u201d Carrie Rigsby, registered nurse at Hastings, said the hospital wants to earn a \u2018Baby Friendly\u2019 designation from the OSDH. \u201cIt is awarded to hospitals that provide an optimal level of care and encourage breastfeeding practices,\u201d Rigsby said. \u201c\u2018Ban the Bag\u2019 is part of the process. Our facility initiated this approximately one year ago and the response has been well-received. Our patients are getting free bags, infant onesies and a water bottle, and these are branded with a new logo.\u201d Rigsby added that physicians and nurses are receiving extensive up-to-date training concerning breastfeeding. \u201cOur dedicated professional staff is committed to supporting families throughout the birth process, with education beginning in the prenatal phase and carried on through delivery and beyond,\u201d she said. \u201cOur goal is to increase breastfeeding rates and better prepare families when they go home with their new baby.\u201d Breastfeeding is one of several steps the OSDH encourages to reduce infant mortality. Others include smoking cessation, early prenatal care, carrying full-term, safe sleep spaces for babies, correct installation of child safety seats, recognizing and getting assistance for postpartum depression and never shaking a baby. \u201cOklahoma hospitals are working to provide quality care to families and joining the \u2018Ban the Bag\u2019 project is a step that sends a strong message to everyone,\u201d Becky Mannel, project leader for the Oklahoma Hospital Breastfeeding Education Project, said. \u201cWe hope more hospitals will join this effort until Oklahoma is a \u2018bag-free\u2019 state.\u201d The project is sponsored by the OSDH under the \u201cPreparing for a Lifetime, It\u2019s Everyone\u2019s Responsibility\u201d initiative to minimize infant deaths in Oklahoma. \u2013 REPRINTED WITH PERMISSION\n\nRead More Officials take steps to manage contract health budget BY JAMI MURPHY\n\nSenior Reporter \u2013 @cp_jmurphy TAHLEQUAH, Okla. \u2013 At the May 16 Health Committee meeting, Tribal Councilors questioned Health Services Director Connie Davis and Brett Hayes, who oversees the tribe\u2019s contract health department, about contract health referral reductions for the rest of the fiscal year and the department\u2019s shortfalls. According to an emailed letter from Health Services Executive Medical Director Dr. Roger Montgomery to Davis, who then forwarded it to Tribal Councilors, each year the tribe overspends its contract health budget and he recommends \u201cpeople cut back on the referrals they write.\u201d \u201cPeople don\u2019t really cut back all that much and administration makes up the difference with collections from the clinics, etc., so we don\u2019t end up having to push the issue,\u201d Montgomery states. \u201cThis year, with the implementation of a new electronic health record leading to reduced clinic schedules, and the addition of approximately 10,000 patient visits this year, there are no additional collections to pad Contract Health\u2019s overruns.\u201d Montgomery states that in the first seven months of FY 2016 the tribe spent $25 million of its $35 million contract health budget. \u201cThat leaves $10 million available for the last five months of the fiscal year and no expected increased collections to cover the remainder. If payments for transfers out continue at the same pace of about $200,000 per month, it actually leaves $9 million for everything else,\u201d he writes. At the meeting, Davis said She said the lack of in-house procedures because of referrals has caused contract health spending to get out of control. \u201cSo we\u2019ve asked our docs to do a better job managing patients within our own health centers and not sending them out for things like knee injections, shoulder injections or casting,\u201d she said. She added that the health system had grown by about 10 percent annually since she\u2019s led Health Services and that has impacted spending. \u201cWe\u2019ve budgeted a flat budget with contract health all these years, and so it\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s at some point that we\u2019re going to have to slow some of the (referrals),\u201d she said. Many referrals are approved now that historically hadn\u2019t always been approved, including pain management and orthopedic procedures, Hayes said. Montgomery states that to solve overspending for the rest of FY 2016 requires referral reductions. \u201cBecause of our three chance appeals process, the only real way to ensure not spending money on a referral is to not write the referral at all. In our case, this means reducing the number of referrals written by as much as 50 percent. Contract Health money is and was traditionally earmarked only for urgent and emergent care. It was never intended for elective care,\u201d he states. \u201cIt was never intended for routine follow-ups in patients not having further issues. It was never intended for things we could do ourselves, even if it meant waiting a bit for the care. We added money in the past in programs such as Back to Work to help pay for some of the elective procedures. However, when that money was no longer available, we never dropped those new service lines.\u201d <strong>Referrals that could be reduced included in Montgomery\u2019s statement were:</strong> \u2022 Dizziness workups that were instigated by a vendor apart from the original reason for the referral, \u2022 Prophylactic mastectomy that could be performed at Hastings, \u2022 Circumcision revisions for cosmetic purposes, \u2022 Dermatology: simple excisions, punch biopsies, actinic and seborrheic keratosis treatments and skin tag removals, \u2022 Simple wound care, \u2022 Elective gallbladders, hernias, hysterectomies, etc., that could be performed at Hastings, \u2022 Cardiac clearance by cardiologists that can be done in-house, \u2022 Varicose veins, \u2022 Long-term follow-ups for benign or distant conditions, \u2022 Elective orthopedics-joint replacements, \u2022 Elective repairs, \u2022 Injections at outside vendors, \u2022 Non-elective orthopedics-simple casting, \u2022 PET scans that don\u2019t change treatment, \u2022 Cataracts before Medicare kicks in, and \u2022 Allergy testing and reduction mammoplasty. Not all non-urgent, non-emergency procedures are included in the list. The list was in reference to one day\u2019s referrals, according to Montgomery\u2019s statement. Montgomery also states that providers would have to \u201cpolice themselves\u201d when writing referrals. \u201cIf your case manager is writing all your referrals for you without any real discussion, you will need to halt this practice\u2026Another option is to advocate to your patients the importance of signing up for available resources, such as insurance from the Affordable Care Act, Medicaid, and Medicare Part B,\u201d Montgomery states. \u201cWe can pay for 5 insured referrals for every one uninsured referral. This also brings money into your individual clinics, which allows you to pay for raises, new providers, and creates the cushion that Contract Health used to use when there are overruns. Explain to your patients that signing up for these things are a huge help to Cherokee Nation Health. Ask them if they can afford to and are willing to help.\u201d Montgomery states that if these options were unsuccessful each clinic would be given a budget to work from and be required to review their referrals daily and work within that budget. \u201cIf we still aren\u2019t getting under budget, more drastic action would need to be taken,\u201d he states.\n\nRead More Claremore Indian Hospital hosting \u2018Kids Summer Safety Fest\u2019 BY STAFF REPORTS\n\nCLAREMORE, Okla. \u2013 The Claremore Indian Hospital will host its second annual \u201cKids Summer Safety Fest\u201d from 9:30 a.m. to noon on June 4.

The tribe\u2019s regional prevention coordinators will have an \u201cRx Take Back\u201d booth at the event from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. for those who want to safely dispose of prescriptions that are no longer needed. Wagoner County ranks among the highest in the state for prescription overdose deaths related to painkillers, according to state data. \u201cThe Cherokee Nation knows the importance of not only physical health, but mental health, and is working to ensure our communities and citizens are healthy and safe,\u201d CN certified prevention specialist Coleman Cox said. \u201cPainkillers such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and codeine, are some of the most abused prescription drugs in our 14-counties. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have safe drop off bags and locations to get these no longer used drugs out of medicine cabinets and homes.\u201d The CN is using a grant from the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to raise awareness of the problem and create prevention plans. The CN regional prevention coordinators who work through the tribe\u2019s Behavioral Health department routinely drop bags at pharmacies with information on safe use, safe storage and safe disposal of prescription drugs. In Wagoner County, Owl Drug on Main Street gives the bags out to raise awareness. \u201cWe like the prescription take back bags and handing them out with some prescriptions,\u201d pharmacist Matthew Villandry said. \u201cWe think it helps and have also seen a decrease in hydrocodone use because we now ask customers to fill another prescription along with it.\u201d Residents can dispose of prescriptions at the booth on Saturday or at any time at the Wagoner County Sheriff\u2019s Office at 307 E. Cherokee St., Wagoner Police Department at 105 S. Casaver Ave. or the Coweta Police Department at 212 N. Broadway, where each has disposal bins.

Comanche Nation citizen Charon Asetoyer, who is also the Native American Women\u2019s Health Education Resource Center\u2019s CEO, said the book is a woman-to-woman, woman-to-girl, girl-to-girl community response in regards to sexual assault. \u201cSharing with them, providing support, letting them know they are not alone. That this is not their fault and they shouldn\u2019t blame themselves. The book instructs them on how to report if they choose to,\u201d Asetoyer said. \u201cIt talks to them about going in for STD exam and also access to emergency contraceptive Plan B.\u201d Kingfisher and Asetoyer joined Elizabeth Black Bull and Donna Haukaas to co-write the book. [BLOCKQUOTE]Asetoyer said she was asked by a young mother on the Yankton Sioux Reservation in Lake Andes what she should do if her daughter was raped. Asetoyer said that when a mother puts it as when, not if, her daughter is raped, there is a realization that the problem is worse than originally thought. Asetoyer said the book sends a message to women and helps them realize it is not their fault. \u201cThere are other women out there. You\u2019re not alone, and turn to them for help,\u201d she said. Kingfisher said the project was personal and that she\u2019s worked with Asetoyer on the book for about four years. \u201cI think it\u2019s so important that we advocate for our health and for our women. As a young girl who was assaulted and didn\u2019t know anything\u2026and later became pregnant and was forced to give up a child for adoption, I didn\u2019t know any of these things. Nobody talked. These conversations didn\u2019t happen at the kitchen table or even around girlfriends,\u201d Kingfisher said. She added that she and Asetoyer, as well as other advocates fighting against sexual assault, want to make this issue real. \u201cFor me it\u2019s important that we serve that matriarchal role of being good aunties, being good grandmas, being big sisters and helping,\u201d she said. According to the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, one of the nation\u2019s largest anti-sexual assault organizations, during an American Indian or Alaskan woman\u2019s lifetime she is at a 34.1 percent chance of suffering from rape or attempted rape, the most of any other race. And about 3 percent of American men have experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetimes. The book is available for download at <a href=\"http://forwomen.org/resources/an-abc-handbook-for-native-girls/\" target=\"_blank\">http://forwomen.org/resources/an-abc-handbook-for-native-girls/</a> Kingfisher said hardcopy bulk orders would be available in the future. <strong>Women</strong> \u2022 1 out of every 6 American women has been the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime (14.8 percent completed rape; 2.8 percent attempted rape). \u2022 17.7 million American women have been victims of attempted or completed rape. \u2022 9 of every 10 rape victims were female in 2003. <strong>Lifetime rate of rape/attempted rape for women by race:</strong> All: 17.6 percent White: 17.7 percent Black: 18.8 percent Asian Pacific Islander: 6.8 percent American Indian/Alaskan: 34.1 percent Mixed race: 24.4 percent <strong>Men</strong> \u2022 About 3 percent of American men have experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime. \u2022 From 1995-2010, 9 percent of rape and sexual assault victims were male. \u2022 2.78 million men in the U.S. have been victims of sexual assault or rape. <strong>Children</strong> \u2022 15 percent of sexual assault and rape victims are under age 12. \u2022 29 percent are ages 12-17. \u2022 44 percent are under age 18. \u2022 80 percent are under age 30. \u2022 Ages 12-34 are the highest-risk years. \u2022 Girls ages 16-19 are 4 times more likely than the general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault. \u2022 7 percent of girls in grades 5-8 and 12 percent of girls in grades 9-12 said they had been sexually abused. \u2022 3 percent of boys grades 5-8 and 5 percent of boys in grades 9-12 said they had been sexually abused. \u2022 82 percent of all juvenile victims are female. \u2022 The year in a male\u2019s life when he is most likely to be the victim of a sexual assault is age 4. A female\u2019s year of greatest risk is age 14. \u2022 1 in 9 girls and 1 in 53 boys under the age of 18 experience sexual abuse or assault at the hands of an adult. \u2022 In 1995, local child protection service agencies identified 126,000 children who were victims of either substantiated or indicated sexual abuse. \u2022 Of these, 75 percent were girls. \u2022 Nearly 30 percent of child victims were between ages 4-7. <strong>Every 8 minutes, Child Protective Service responds to a report of sexual abuse.</strong> \u2022 93 percent of juvenile sexual assault victims know their attacker. \u2022 34.2 percent of attackers were family members. \u2022 58.7 percent were acquaintances. \u2022 Only 7 percent of the perpetrators were strangers to the victim. \u2022 For 80 percent of juvenile victims, the perpetrator was a parent. 6 percent were other relatives. 4 percent were unmarried partners of a parent. 5 percent were \u201cother\u201d (from siblings to strangers). <strong>American Indians</strong> \u2022 On average during 1992-2001, American Indians age 12 or older experienced annually an estimated 5,900 rapes or sexual assaults. \u2022 American Indians were twice as likely to experience a rape/sexual assault compared to all races. \u2022 Sexual violence makes up 5 percent of all violent crime committed against Indians (about the same as for other races). \u2022 Offender/victim relationship: 41 percent stranger; 34 percent acquaintance; 25 percent intimate or family member. <strong>Campus Sexual Violence</strong> \u2022 Women 18-24 who are enrolled in college are 3 times more likely than women in general to suffer from sexual violence. Females of the same age who are not enrolled in college are 4 times more likely. \u2022 Male college-aged students are 78 percent more likely than nonstudents to be a victim of rape or sexual assault. \u2022 Female college-aged students are 20 percent less likely than nonstudents to be a victim of rape or sexual assault. \u2022 Only 20 percent of female student survivors age 18-24 report to law enforcement. In comparison, 33 percent of female nonstudent survivors aged 18-24 report to law enforcement. \u2022 72 percent of campus law enforcement agencies have a staff member responsible for survivor response and assistance. \u2022 8 percent of all sexual assaults occur while victim is attending school. <strong>Victims of sexual assault are:</strong> 3 times more likely to suffer from depression. 6 times more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. 13 times more likely to abuse alcohol. 26 times more likely to abuse drugs. 4 times more likely to contemplate suicide.
