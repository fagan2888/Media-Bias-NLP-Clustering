Previously, Aetna denied the mammogram because it fell under policy exclusions for treatments related to \u201cchanging sex.\u201d\n\nIn their letter last week to Dr. Frieden, Ms. Tobin and Ms. Snowdon demanded the CDC promptly change its policy.\n\nDenying preventive care to an at-risk population \u2014 including cancer screenings for transgender women \u2014 \u201cputs individuals at risk and generally exacerbates the health disparities and poor health outcomes experienced by the transgender community,\u201d they said.\n\nDr. Madeline Deutsch of the Center of Excellence for Transgender Health in San Francisco said Friday that evidence is scant about breast cancer in transwomen, but the issue \u201cis on my radar.\u201d\n\nThe transgender-health center recommends mammograms for male-to-female transgender patients who are on feminizing hormone therapy if they have been using estrogen for at least 30 years and are at least 50 years old.\n\nYounger transwomen with a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer should consider getting mammograms at an earlier age, noted the center, which is located at University of California-San Francisco.\n\nMale-to-female transgender people typically use hormone therapy to grow breasts. It is not uncommon to also have implants or surgery to enhance the breasts.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, women who have had breast-conserving treatment, such as a lumpectomy, continue to need regular mammograms of both breasts.\n\nHowever, women who have had a total mastectomy and reconstruction with silicone gel or saline implants do not need routine mammograms of the affected side. Women who have a reconstructed breast using their own tissue also do not need a mammogram of that breast, unless indicated in a physical exam.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Two advocacy groups are demanding that transgender women be given free mammograms under President Obama's new health care law, following reports that a transgender woman was denied a government-financed mammogram at a clinic in Colorado.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Two advocacy groups are demanding that transgender women be given free mammograms under President Obama\u2019s new health care law, following reports that a transgender woman was denied a government-financed mammogram at a clinic in Colorado.", "title": "Transgender advocates want free mammograms under Obamacare", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/18/advocates-demand-free-mammograms-transgender-women/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/03/26/obamacare.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2013/03/26/obamacare.jpg", "description": "Two advocacy groups are demanding that transgender women be given free mammograms under President Obama's new health care law, following reports that a transgender woman was denied a government-financ", "card": "summary", "title": "Transgender advocates want free mammograms under Obamacare"}, "Author": "Cheryl Wetzstein", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Social Issues, Health Medical Pharma, United States Centers For Disease Control And Prevention, Jennifer Blair"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb1d7\"", "article_summary": "Two advocacy groups are demanding that transgender women be given free mammograms under President Obama\u2019s new health care law, following reports that a transgender woman was denied a government-financed mammogram at a clinic in Colorado.\n\u201cThat is irrational discrimination, plain and simple,\u201d said Harper Jean Tobin, director of policy for the National Center for Transgender Equality.\nDenying preventive care to an at-risk population \u2014 including cancer screenings for transgender women \u2014 \u201cputs individuals at risk and generally exacerbates the health disparities and poor health outcomes experienced by the transgender community,\u201d they said.\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, women who have had breast-conserving treatment, such as a lumpectomy, continue to need regular mammograms of both breasts.\nHowever, women who have had a total mastectomy and reconstruction with silicone gel or saline implants do not need routine mammograms of the affected side."}
