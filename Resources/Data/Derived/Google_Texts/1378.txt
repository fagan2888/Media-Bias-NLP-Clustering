General Atlantic Hands Amedes to Antin Infrastructure

The deal was announced just days after reports indicated that General Atlantic was exploring a $175M purchase of Indian financial firm Sharekhan

General Atlantic will sell its majority stake in laboratory services company Amedes Holding AG to Antin Infrastructure Partners. Financial terms of the deal remain undisclosed.

When word of the sale process first came about in 2013, Hamburg, Germany-based Amedes was said to be valued at $1.1 billion. The company has 3,500 employees, 35 laboratories and 27 medical practices across Germany and Belgium. It has been owned by Greenwich, Connecticut-based General Atlantic since 2007.

Since then, it has grown to become one of the largest clinical lab groups, with more than 2,600 employees in Germany and Belgium, providing lab tests for patients, doctors and hospitals.

Antin Infrastructure, based in Paris, specializes in growth, infrastructure, and mezzanine investments.

General Atlantic announced the deal just days after media reports indicated that the firm was exploring a $175 million purchase of Indian stock broking firm Sharekhan. In December, General Atlantic acquired Vox Media, owner of Vox.com, Eater and Curbed.
