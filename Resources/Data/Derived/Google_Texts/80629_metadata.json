The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 520 points Friday, bringing the index's losses for the week to 1,017.\n\nAs of Friday the Dow, Nasdaq and Russell 2000 were all down more than 10 percent from recent peaks, putting them in correction territory. The S&P 500 had its worst week in nearly four years.\n\nRead More Mark Grant: US 10-year yield to hit 1.75%\n\n\n\nThe mispricing of assets does two things, according to Grant. It pulls demand forward and pushes failure out. He pointed to the junk bond market as an example of central bank intervention. He noted that default rates in the space during the last year were 2.3 percent on average, compared with the average of 4.6 percent going back to 1970.\n\nCompanies are borrowing more at this phase of the financing cycle when they might have drawn down debt in the past, he said. That is in part because the terms dictating how that debt will be paid back is looser than it has been in the past, he explained.\n\n\"It gives companies a great deal more latitude to persist and to expand and survive,\" Grant said. \"Now, in capitalism there is meant to be failure. It's like the forest floor. There is life, there is regeneration, there is death. Without that, what you find is a bunch of dead ferns. What we have in America it seems to me is more and more evidence of fernitization.\"\n\nThe Federal Reserve has given the United States a system of enterprise that is much slower to change, he added.\n\nRead MoreDavid Katz: Don't get too crazy about this selloff\n\n\n\nBy printing more money and suppressing interest rates, the U.S. central bank sought to stimulate aggregate demand, but also inadvertently stimulated aggregate supply, he said. That has led to more capital expenditures, production and oil supply.\n\nThe Fed has held interest rates near zero since December 2008.\n\nThe \"lot of everything\" that policy has produced weighs on price indices, leading the Fed to print more money and further suppress rates in order to meet inflation targets, Grant said.\n\nHe acknowledged that his earlier call that inflation would ramp up was wrong, but said inflation manifests in different ways.\n\n\"It seems to me the really pernicious inflation of this cycle has been the systematic comprehensive mispricing of asset prices,\" Grant said.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Central bank activity has provided the backdrop to the stock market's recent selloff, Jim Grant said.", "author": "Tom DiChristopher", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Central bank activity has provided the backdrop to the stock market's recent selloff, Jim Grant said.", "title": "Grant: Central bank mispricing is backdrop to selloff", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/24/jim-grant-central-banks-can-and-should-override-the-price-mechanism.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/12/17/101278958-124106511.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Central bank activity has provided the backdrop to the stock market's recent selloff, Jim Grant said.", "title": "Grant: Central bank mispricing is backdrop to selloff", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/24/jim-grant-central-banks-can-and-should-override-the-price-mechanism.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2013/12/17/101278958-124106511.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@tdichristopher", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "U.S. Markets, Markets, Market Outlook, Central Banks, Investing, The Fed, Wall Street, Squawk Box U.S., Dow Industrials, NASDAQ, RUSSELL 2000 IND, S&P 500 Index, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-08-24T07:48:02-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "U.S. Markets", "modified_time": "2015-08-24T09:02:05-0400", "tag": "S&P 500 Index"}, "pageNodeId": 102941668, "news_keywords": "us stock selloff, jim grant, mispricing, backdrop"}, "article_summary": "Central bank activity has provided the backdrop to the stock market's recent selloff, closely followed market watcher Jim Grant said Monday.\nHe pointed to the junk bond market as an example of central bank intervention.\nJames Grant, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, says the mis-pricing of asset values led by the central banks is the essential back story to this morning's selloff.\nRead MoreDavid Katz: Don't get too crazy about this selloffBy printing more money and suppressing interest rates, the U.S. central bank sought to stimulate aggregate demand, but also inadvertently stimulated aggregate supply, he said.\n\"It seems to me the really pernicious inflation of this cycle has been the systematic comprehensive mispricing of asset prices,\" Grant said."}
