The U.S. ratified the 156-member-country convention in 1994.\n\nBruni, an Italian, said the 10-member panel recommended \u201cthat all instances of police brutality and excessive use of force by law enforcement officers are investigated promptly, effectively and impartially by an independent mechanism with no institutional or hierarchical connection between the investigators and the alleged perpetrators.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 12-13, nearly 30 senior officials from the U.S. Departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security, along with the attorney general of Mississippi, presented evidence and were examined by the U.N. panel. The session was part of the periodic review of U.S. compliance with the anti-torture convention. The U.S. was last reviewed in May 2006.\n\nCivil rights activists and human rights groups also met with the panel in Geneva. Among those testifying were the parents of Michael Brown, 18, who was shot dead Aug. 9 in Ferguson, Missouri, by a police officer. A grand jury chose this week not to indict the officer.\n\nAsked about the decision not to charge the officer who shot Brown, Bruni said: \u201cIt is always a tragedy when a person is killed and especially by an official of the government. \u2026 [I] can\u2019t say more because there has been a judicial decision on this point and we have to respect that decision.\u201d\n\nThe committee also said it was concerned about what it called excessive use of force by law enforcement officials against immigrants and LGBT individuals, about racial profiling and about the growing militarization of policing activities.\n\n\u201cThis [U.N.] report \u2014 along with the voices of Americans protesting around the country this week \u2014 is a wake-up call for police who think they can act with impunity,\u201d Jamil Dakwar, the director of human rights at the American Civil Liberties Union, said.\n\nThe panel said it was appalled at the number of reported deaths that followed the use of stun guns, and it recommended that the weapons be used \u201cexclusively in extreme and limited situations\u201d and be banned for use on children and pregnant women.\n\nThe U.N. panel noted its concern at what it described as the high number of deaths in custody \u2014 958 inmates died in American jails in 2012, up nearly 8 percent from 2010 \u2014 and it called on the U.S. government to investigate all deaths of detainees promptly.\n\nThe panel said the U.S. should limit solitary confinement to \u201ca measure of last resort\u201d and prohibit its use for juveniles, people with disabilities, and pregnant and breastfeeding women. It said it was concerned about the use of solitary confinement for indefinite periods.\n\nBruni said keeping people in maximum-security prisons in solitary confinement up to 22 to 23 hours a day was not acceptable.\n\nThe panel also raised concerns about the U.S. military\u2019s interrogation methods. Bruni said, \u201cCertain changes have to be made in certain parts of the military manual for interrogation.\u201d\n\nThe report said the U.S. should abolish the \u201cphysical separation technique,\u201d which limits detainees to at least four hours of continued sleep.\n\nWith regard to the Guantanamo Bay detention facility, the panel concluded that the U.S. should \u201ccease the use of indefinite detention without charge or trial for individuals suspected of terrorism or related activities,\u201d and it recommended that the government end the force-feeding of detainees on hunger strikes.", "article_metadata": {"description": "GENEVA \u2014 A U.N. anti-torture panel investigating the United States said Friday it was deeply concerned by what it described as the high incidence of police brutality and shootings \u2014 especially against African-Americans \u2014 in the U.S., was troubled by what it called harsh conditions in many prisons and was [...] Maine news, sports, politics and election results, and obituaries from the Bangor Daily News.", "generator": "WordPress 4.1.5", "og": {"site_name": "The Bangor Daily News", "description": "GENEVA \u2014 A U.N. anti-torture panel investigating the United States said Friday it was deeply concerned by what it described as the high incidence of police brutality and shootings \u2014 especially against African-Americans \u2014 in the U.S., was troubled by what it called harsh conditions in many prisons and was [...]", "title": "UN concerned about incidences of brutality, shootings by US police", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2014/11/28/news/world-news/un-concerned-about-incidences-of-brutality-shootings-by-us-police/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10066741_H14079337-600x400.jpg?strip=all", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "GENEVA \u2014 A U.N. anti-torture panel investigating the United States said Friday it was deeply concerned by what it described as the high incidence of police brutality and shootings \u2014 especially against African-Americans \u2014 in the U.S., was troubled by what it called harsh conditions in many prisons and was [...]", "title": "UN concerned about incidences of brutality, shootings by US police", "url": "http://bangordailynews.com/2014/11/28/news/world-news/un-concerned-about-incidences-of-brutality-shootings-by-us-police/", "image": "http://static.bangordailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/10066741_H14079337-250x250.jpg?strip=all", "site": "@bangordailynews", "card": "summary"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "fb": {"app_id": 748756371893770}, "keywords": "Maine, news, elections, election results, politics, sports, Bangor, Portland, Augusta, weather, obituaries, Waterville, Aroostook, Penobscot, Piscataquis, Somerset, Hancock, Washington, bdn,nation,news,world,regions,bangor daily news,un concerned about incidences of brutality, shootings by us police,is_article,unbylined", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Civil rights activists and human rights groups also met with the panel in Geneva.\nBruni said keeping people in maximum-security prisons in solitary confinement up to 22 to 23 hours a day was not acceptable.\nDepartments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security, along with the attorney general of Mississippi, presented evidence and were examined by the U.N. panel.\nIt said it was concerned about the use of solitary confinement for indefinite periods.\nAmong those testifying were the parents of Michael Brown, 18, who was shot dead Aug. 9 in Ferguson, Missouri, by a police officer."}
