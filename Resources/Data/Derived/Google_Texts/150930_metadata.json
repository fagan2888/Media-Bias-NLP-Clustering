In many cases, deductibles \u201care running between $2,500 and $5,000,\u201d and people can\u2019t pay them, said Maggie Elehwany, chief lobbyist for the National Rural Health Association.\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nOne of the assumptions of the ACA is that states would all sign on with the federal government to expand Medicaid and share the costs; but 23 states have declined to take on the new, unknown financial burden.\n\nThe Post reports other factors contributing to hospital closures include:\n\n\u2026declining populations; disproportionate numbers of elderly and uninsured patients; the frequent need to pay doctors better than top dollar to get them to work in the hinterlands; the cost of expensive equipment that is necessary but frequently underused; the inability to provide lucrative specialty services and treatments; and an emphasis on emergency and urgent care, chronic money-losers. Advertisement \u2013 story continues below\n\nThe NRHA, representing over 2,000 rural hospitals and other health care facilities, stated that 48 hospitals have closed since 2010 and 283 are in trouble. In Texas alone, 10 have closed. Rural hospitals serve approximately half of the nation\u2019s population.\n\nRural health care experts warn that the country could undergo a similar rash of closures as that experienced in the mid-eighties and early nineties following a change in how the federal government reimbursed Medicare billing to fixed payment amounts. That change favored large, efficient hospitals and hurt smaller, rural ones, which lacked the same economies of scale. The policy was amended in 1997 to make exceptions for smaller hospitals.\n\nThe ACA, passed with the intention of giving more access to health care, may have the unintended consequence of causing many communities throughout the United States to have less, unless changes are made.\n\nh/t: IJReview\n\nAdvertisement \u2013 story continues below", "article_metadata": {"description": "Smaller hospitals across the U.S. are shutting their doors.", "author": "Randy DeSoto", "og": {"site_name": "Western Journalism", "description": "....the unintended consequence of causing many...", "title": "Revealed: Obamacare Is Causing One Big Thing To Happen That Obama Never Saw Coming", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 634, "identifier": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/obamacare-passing.jpg", "height": 426}, "updated_time": "2015-03-20T15:18:17-07:00", "url": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/obamacare-causing-rural-hospital-closures/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Smaller hospitals across the U.S. are shutting their doors.", "creator": "@WestJournalism", "image": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/obamacare-passing.jpg", "title": "Revealed: Obamacare Is Causing One Big Thing To Happen That Obama Never Saw Coming", "site": "@WestJournalism", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-03-18T11:32:05-07:00", "fb": {"app_id": 275784739127435, "pages": 123624513983}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.westernjournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/android-chrome-192x192.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WesternJournalism", "section": "Best Of The Week", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2015-03-18T11:32:05-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-20T15:18:17-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "rural hospitals, rural hospitals closing, obamacare hurting hospitals, obamacare hurting rural hospitals, obamacare hurts smaller hospitals, affordable care act, affordable care act hurts small hospitals, affordable care act hurts rural hospitals, where will rural communities go, health, obamacare, politics, nation, religion"}, "article_summary": "In many cases, deductibles \u201care running between $2,500 and $5,000,\u201d and people can\u2019t pay them, said Maggie Elehwany, chief lobbyist for the National Rural Health Association.\nAdvertisement - story continues belowChanges ushered in by the Affordable Care Act are putting the financial squeeze on smaller, rural hospitals and contributing to an alarming number of closures.\nThat change favored large, efficient hospitals and hurt smaller, rural ones, which lacked the same economies of scale.\nRural hospitals serve approximately half of the nation\u2019s population.\nThe Washington Post, in collaboration with Kaiser Health News, reported on this disturbing trend happening throughout the United States."}
