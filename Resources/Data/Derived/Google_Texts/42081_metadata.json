Research shows that expanding Medicaid to this new class of individuals discourages work, depresses earnings, reduces labor-force participation and hurts the economy. Rather than fixing Medicaid for the truly needy, ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion overloads the safety net with able-bodied adults and prioritizes them over the nation\u2019s most vulnerable patients.\n\nSince the North Carolina legislature in 2013 rejected Medicaid expansion in order to get the state\u2019s largest entitlement program at $14 billion under control, the state has not become victim to an \u201cimmoral funding formula that prods states to attack the truly needy with cuts in services and gives preferential treatment to adults without any disabilities or dependent children.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Obamacare creates a \u201cperverse incentive\u201d for states to adopt expansion says Jonathan Ingram, Director of Research for FGA, where the federal government will reimburse on average 57% for the very needy, but 90% (100% for first three years) for able-bodied adults.\n\nThe federal government offers the carrot of high reimbursement rates for non-working childless adults, but states that take on expansion pay the price of having to cut other areas of Medicaid.\n\nSeveral states including Arizona, Oregon, Maine and Illinois expanded Medicaid, but ended up either eliminating the program for critically ill patients or going into insurmountable debt.\n\nRecently, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory suggested expanding Medicaid would be a possibility in the future. He discussed \u201ccrafting state-specific proposals for Medicaid expansion\u201d with other governors and Health and Human Services director Sylvia Burwell at the National Governors Association conference.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to figure out is how can we get more waivers to adapt to what North Carolina needs,\u201d he said. \u201cCan we do it in a strategic way instead of across the board, do a better definition \u2014 if we do expand it \u2014 and get more assurance of what our true costs will be three or four years down the road, regardless of who the governor will be?\u201d\n\nWhile visiting a Western Carolina health facility, Robin Cummings, the new state Medicaid director said, \u201cI would agree with what the governor said. We need to get Medicaid itself stabilized. Expansion would have brought 500,000 to I\u2019ve heard as high as 750,000 additional people into the system. I\u2019ll tell you right now, I think that would have broken it.\u201d\n\nMcCrory asks what the true costs will be down the road\u2014he need only to read the FGA report to find the answers.\n\nRELATED ARTICLES\n\nCOMMENTS", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog Wire - North Carolina", "description": "The Foundation for Government Accountability released its \u201cWho Is on the Obamacare Chopping Block?\u201d report showing how Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion in 26 states and the District of Columbia has failed to help the most vulnerable.", "title": "New Report: Medicaid Expansion Hurts the Most Vulnerable", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/53392966856d87a9625c713a9986d1eb?s=100&d=mm&r=g", "updated_time": "2014-07-17T14:28:33+00:00", "url": "http://watchdogwire.com/northcarolina/2014/07/17/new-report-medicaid-expansion-hurts-the-most-vulnerable/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Waste, Fraud and Abuse", "tag": "North Carolina", "published_time": "2014-07-17T12:59:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-07-17T14:28:33+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 318261258258275}, "robots": "all", "description": "The Foundation for Government Accountability released a report showing how Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion hasn't helped the most vulnerable."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0663\"", "article_summary": "Rather than fixing Medicaid for the truly needy, ObamaCare\u2019s Medicaid expansion overloads the safety net with able-bodied adults and prioritizes them over the nation\u2019s most vulnerable patients.\nThe study reveals the real winners of Medicaid expansion are not the elderly, the disabled or even low-income kids, but childless adults.\nThe Foundation for Government Accountability released its \u201cWho Is on the Obamacare Chopping Block?\u201d report showing how Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion in 26 states and the District of Columbia has failed to help the most vulnerable.\nHe discussed \u201ccrafting state-specific proposals for Medicaid expansion\u201d with other governors and Health and Human Services director Sylvia Burwell at the National Governors Association conference.\nRecently, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory suggested expanding Medicaid would be a possibility in the future."}
