In the meantime, Trump Entertainment said that they were pleased with the ruling that should see an end to the messages appearing on their properties.\n\n\u201cWe are gratified that the court put a stop to Local 54 activities that only harm the perception of Atlantic City and their own members,\u201d Trump Entertainment said in a statement.\n\nHowever, the increasing acrimony between the two sides seems to be pushing the union closer to waging a strike against the Taj Mahal. According to Unite-HERE, that\u2019s exactly what will happen unless Trump Entertainment agrees to restore benefits to its workers.\n\n\u201cWe want to give the company one last chance to come to their senses,\u201d said union spokesperson Ben Begleiter. \u201cThe workers at the Taj are fed up, and they\u2019re ready to go on strike.\u201d\n\nThe workers are currently receiving smaller stipends designed to help them purchase coverage individually, typically on exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nHowever, union workers say the stipends are not enough for those with families to get similar coverage to what they enjoyed under their previous health care plan.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A New Jersey judge has ruled that union workers cannot use projectors to place messages on the outside walls of the Carl Icahn casinos including Tropicana.", "og": {"site_name": "Casino.org", "description": "A New Jersey judge has ruled that union workers cannot use projectors to place messages on the outside walls of the Carl Icahn casinos including Tropicana.", "title": "Union Barred from Beaming Messages to Walls of Carl Icahn Casinos", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 1500, "identifier": "https://www.casino.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/taj_mahal.jpg", "height": 1000}, "updated_time": "2015-08-28T13:31:27-07:00", "url": "https://www.casino.org/news/union-barred-from-beaming-messages-to-walls-of-carl-icahn-casinos", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A New Jersey judge has ruled that union workers cannot use projectors to place messages on the outside walls of the Carl Icahn casinos including Tropicana.", "creator": "@Casino_Org", "image": "https://www.casino.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/taj_mahal.jpg", "title": "Union Barred from Beaming Messages to Walls of Carl Icahn Casinos", "site": "@Casino_Org", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "DC.date.issued": "2015-08-28T13:27:28-07:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.casino.org/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/corg_favicon.png", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/Casino.org", "section": "Legislation", "published_time": "2015-08-28T13:27:28-07:00", "modified_time": "2015-08-28T13:31:27-07:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The union had been placing these messages on the Tropicana, which Icahn already owns, as well as the Trump Taj Mahal and the shuttered Trump Plaza.\nHowever, union workers say the stipends are not enough for those with families to get similar coverage to what they enjoyed under their previous health care plan.\nThe bitter fight between Icahn and the union began when Icahn agreed to invest in the Taj Mahal, taking over the struggling casino in order to prevent it from closing.\nHowever, the increasing acrimony between the two sides seems to be pushing the union closer to waging a strike against the Taj Mahal.\nIn the meantime, Trump Entertainment said that they were pleased with the ruling that should see an end to the messages appearing on their properties."}
