Most of those who say the death penalty is a major factor are backing Bob Beauprez, the Republican challenger to Gov. John Hickenlooper.\n\nHickenlooper has faced criticism from death penalty supporters since he granted Chuck E. Cheese killer Nathan Dunlap a reprieve on his death sentence in May 2013, leaving the decision to the next governor. Recently Hickenlooper suggested he might grant Dunlap clemency if he does not win reelection.\n\nCountering that, Beauprez has vowed on the campaign trail to execute Dunlap, making the issue into an applause line.\n\nThe Post\u2019s poll \u2014 which found the race neck and neck \u2014 surveyed voters on the death penalty. ( Read complete results here.)\n\nSixty-three percent of respondents said they support the death penalty, and 28 percent are opposed while 10 percent are unsure. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.\n\nThe nearly one in five respondents who say the death penalty is a major factor in their vote for governor back Beauprez 3-to-1, SurveyUSA says.\n\nBut 47 percent say it\u2019s a minor factor, and their support is split between the candidates, the pollster says.\n\nAmong the 33 percent who say the death penalty isn\u2019t a factor, most \u2014 by a 2-to-1 margin \u2014 back Hickenlooper.\n\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JonMurray\n\nColorado governor\u2019s race\n\nThe Denver Post\u2019s poll by SurveyUSA was conducted Sept. 8 through Sept. 10. Pollsters started with 850 Colorado adults and narrowed the field to 664 likely voters. SurveyUSA contacted both landlines and cell phones. The poll results have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.9 percentage points. Pollsters weighted the sample by gender, age, race and region, but not by party identification.
