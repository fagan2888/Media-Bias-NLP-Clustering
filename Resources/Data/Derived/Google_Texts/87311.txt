Bloomberg

When Michael Bloomberg ends his tenure as mayor of New York City next week, he’ll have many lasting legacies to celebrate. But he’ll also go out with the taste of defeat still lingering: Just five months earlier, his attempt to outlaw the sale of large sugary drinks in restaurants and other venues was overturned in the courts.

As a consolation prize, the mayor’s high-profile campaign against the health risks of soda may have contributed to a 6.8% decline in the amount of soda purchased in New York in the last year.

And here’s another consolation prize: As the WSJ’s Amy Guthrie reports, Bloombergian limitations on unhealthy food and drink are taking off in Latin America:

Since 2012, Peru, Uruguay and Costa Rica have banned junk food from public schools. Ecuador recently mandated a nutritional label system inspired by a traffic light, in which warnings of high salt, sugar and fat content are placed on red circles; lower levels will be indicated on yellow or green circles. Industrial food makers in Ecuador will also be barred from using images of animal characters, cartoon personalities or celebrities to promote products high in salt, sugar or fat. In October, Mexico’s congress passed a special tax of 8% on packaged foods like potato chips, as well as a per-liter tax of one peso, or about eight U.S. cents, on sugary beverages. The beverage tax is widely seen as the most significant attempt yet to curb sugary-drink intake in a large country, given that Mexico is the Coca-Cola Co.’s second-biggest market in the world by volume sales. Colombia’s health minister has already suggested applying a sugary-beverage tax in his country.

And it’s not just Latin America: The government of the United Arab Emirates has also said it will ban large-sized sodas.
