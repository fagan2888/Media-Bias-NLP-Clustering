MADISON, Wis. (WXPR) -- The U.S. Bureau of Labor announced salaried workers earning about $47,000 per year will be eligible for overtime pay beginning December 1.

The prior level was roughly half that figure.The reaction was quick and negative from business groups and some politicians. But Dr. Robert Kraig is Executive Director of Citizen Action of Wisconsin and says contrary to what business and politicians are saying, these are productive workers not being paid for work they're doing. "These are workers working on average 47 hours per week but not being paid any overtime because the rule is so out of date. This means they will have more money in their pockets, more money to spend in the local communities.When I hear some of these businesses complaining about this they're only taking into account their costs. They're not taking into account their customers will have more money to spend."

Kraig says an estimated 198,000 Wisconsin workers would qualify. Major business groups said the rules likely will mean less employment overall and less flexibility with employee time due to tighter working hours. Citizen Action of Wisconsin has a long history of supporting liberal causes, such as President Obama's new overtime order, elimination of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, and has taken positions in favor of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and other Democratic party initiatives. Their board of directors is made up primarily of labor union leaders and pro-abortion leaders.
