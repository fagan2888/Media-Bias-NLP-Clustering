The four \u201cSuper Flanker\u201d jets will support other elements of the Russian and Syrian air forces, which are also protected by an S-400 Triumf air defense system that\u2019s been installed at Moscow\u2019s airbase near the Syrian city of Latakia.\n\nThe deployment gives Russian President Vladimir Putin another opportunity to showcase Moscow\u2019s war machine and boost the Su-35 program. The twin-engine jet, which many analysts compare to the F/A-18 Super Hornet made by Boeing, flew in exercises in the Pacific last year. Now the plane, which has unusual maneuvering capabilities thanks to its thrust vectoring engines (see the video above), can be tested in a real war environment.\n\nEarlier this month the Kremlin placed an order for 50 of the jets on top of the 48 it ordered in 2009. Sukhoi, Russia\u2019s major aircraft manufacturer, recently struck a $2 billion agreement with China for 24 Su-35S jets and a deal to produce another dozen for Indonesia.\n\nRelated: Putin Flexes His Muscles in the Pacific with the New Su-35 Fighter\n\nRussia has flown roughly 6,000 missions since Moscow launched its air campaign inside Syria last September, including 468 combat missions last week alone, according to Konashenkov.\n\nMoscow\u2019s air support has helped the regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad fight insurgent forces to a standstill and even gain ground in recent weeks, according to fresh estimates of the five-year-old civil war.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Russia has added a major weapons system to the already impressive arsenal it has deployed to Syria.", "title": "Putin Sends Russia\u2019s Deadly New Fighter Jet to Syria", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/02/Putin-Sends-Russia-s-Deadly-New-Fighter-Jet-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Sukhoi_Su-35S_in_2009.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/02/Putin-Sends-Russia-s-Deadly-New-Fighter-Jet-Syria", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/Sukhoi_Su-35S_in_2009.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Russia has added a major weapons system to the already impressive arsenal it has deployed to Syria.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Russia\u2019s Military Buildup Continues with Big New Fighter Jet OrderRussian media said the aircraft will provide another layer of protection to warplanes conducting raids in Syria.\nRussia has added a major weapon system to the already impressive arsenal it has deployed to Syria.\nThe deployment gives Russian President Vladimir Putin another opportunity to showcase Moscow\u2019s war machine and boost the Su-35 program.\nThe twin-engine jet, which many analysts compare to the F/A-18 Super Hornet made by Boeing, flew in exercises in the Pacific last year.\nMoscow\u2019s supermaneuverable Su-35S fighter jets started \u201cto carry out military tasks last week\u201d in the war-torn country, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj.
