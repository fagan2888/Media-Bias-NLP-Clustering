New Zealand Prime Minister John Key took the \u201cunusual step\u201d recently of addressing this charge directly and categorically denying that he is an alien lizard person.\n\n\n\n\u201cTo the best of my knowledge, no,\u201d Key told reporters. \u201cHaving been asked that question directly, I\u2019ve taken the unusual step of not only seeing a doctor but a vet, and both have confirmed I\u2019m not a reptile.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m certainly not a reptile,\u201d Key continued. \u201cI\u2019ve never been in a spaceship, never been in outer space, and my tongue\u2019s not overly long either.\u201d\n\nBoth President Barack Obama and former Defense Sec.
