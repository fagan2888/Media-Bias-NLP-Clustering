He published a piece condemning Clinton \u2013 one of many similar columns for the Washington Post conservative \u2013 but he did so in a very specific way.\n\nClinton is \u201cdefined by littleness,\u201d Will said, adding, \u201cHe is the least consequential president\u201d since Calvin Coolidge in the 1920s.\n\nIt\u2019s arguably the harshest of all possible criticisms. All presidents quickly grow accustomed to a wide variety of rebukes, but no one ever wants to be dismissed as inconsequential. It\u2019s another way of saying your presidency is forgettable. It doesn\u2019t matter. History won\u2019t judge you unkindly because judgments require significance, and you\u2019re just \u2026 irrelevant.\n\nMore than a decade later, President Obama has also received his share of criticisms, but it\u2019s probably fair to say \u201cinconsequential\u201d is an adjective that no one will use to describe his tenure.\n\nWe talked the other day about the remarkable stretch of successes the president has had just since the midterm elections, and it led Matt Yglesias to note the \u201c incredible amount \u201d Obama has accomplished over the last six years.\n\nIt has been, in short, a very busy and extremely consequential lame-duck session. One whose significance is made all the more striking by the fact that it follows an electoral catastrophe for Obama\u2019s party. And that is the Obama era in a microcosm. Democrats\u2019 overwhelming electoral win in 2008 did not prove to be a \u201crealigning\u201d election that handed the party enduring political dominance. Quite the opposite. But it did touch off a wave of domestic policymaking whose scale makes Obama a major historical figure in the way his two predecessors won\u2019t be.\n\nI agree, though I\u2019d go a bit further than just his two more recent predecessors and argue that Obama\u2019s record makes him a major historical figure in ways most presidents are not.\n\nThis isn\u2019t even a normative argument, per se. Obama\u2019s critics, especially on the right, can and should make their case that the president\u2019s agenda is misguided and bad for the country. A leader can have a wealth of accomplishments, but those deeds must still be evaluated on the merits.\n\nWhat Obama\u2019s detractors cannot credibly claim is that those accomplishments do not exist. By now, the list is probably familiar to many observers: the president\u2019s Recovery Act rescued the country from the Great Recession. His Affordable Care Act brought access to medical care to millions of families. Obama rescued the American auto industry, brought new safeguards to Wall Street, overhauled the student loan system, and vastly expanded LGBT rights.\n\nHe improved food safety, consumer protections, and national-service opportunities. He signed the New START treaty, ordered the mission that killed Osama bin Laden, reversed a failed U.S. policy towards Cuba, and used the Clean Air Act to make strides in addressing the climate crisis. He brought new hope to 5 million immigrants living in the United States, moved the federal judiciary in a more progressive direction, and helped restore America\u2019s standing on the global stage.\n\nThe list goes on and on.\n\nYglesias is right that neither Clinton nor Bush can point to a similar litany of policy breakthroughs, but truth be told, very few presidents can. Note than when Paul Krugman praised Obama in his Rolling Stone cover story a couple of months ago, he used two distinct adjectives: \u201cObama has emerged as one of the most consequential and, yes, successful presidents in American history.\u201d\n\nAll of this comes with two meaningful caveats. The first, as noted above, is that being \u201cconsequential\u201d is not evidence of an a priori good. One can acknowledge a president\u2019s accomplishments without liking them (or him). Tom Brady may be a consequential quarterback, but if you\u2019re a Dolphins fan, you\u2019re probably not impressed.\n\nThe second is that there\u2019s a degree of fragility to some of this record. Next year, for example, Republicans on the Supreme Court may very well tear down the American health care system. In time, they may also derail Obama\u2019s climate agenda. Congressional Republicans will spend the foreseeable future chipping away at everything from immigration progress to Wall Street safeguards. And if the nation elects a GOP successor for Obama, the next president may very well undo much of what this president has done.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "President Obama has also received his share of criticisms, but \"inconsequential\" isn't an adjective used to describe his tenure.", "original-source": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/consequential-president", "og": {"site_name": "MSNBC", "description": "President Obama has also received his share of criticisms, but \"inconsequential\" isn't an adjective used to describe his tenure.", "title": "A consequential president", "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/consequential-president", "image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/2013/05/potuses-laughing.jpg?itok=4USZJhQ4", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "msnbc.com", "account_id": 2836421, "creator": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "url": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/consequential-president", "image": {"width": 830, "identifier": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--3-2--512x342/public/2013/05/potuses-laughing.jpg?itok=wUCrCU5P", "height": 553}, "title": "A consequential president", "site": {"identifier": "@msnbc", "id": 2836421}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "President Obama has also received his share of criticisms, but \"inconsequential\" isn't an adjective used to describe his tenure."}, "robots": "follow, index", "DC.date.issued": "2014-12-19T11:31:48-05:00", "jenga-session-config": "{\"when_to_init\":\"after_dom_ready\"}", "fb": {"app_id": 351594351545594}, "nv": {"author": "steve-benen", "title": "A consequential president", "tags": "barack-obama,bill-clinton,democrats,white-house,rachel-maddow-show", "published": 1, "date": "12/19/2014 11:31:48 EST", "address": "http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/consequential-president"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/steve.benen"}, "abstract": "President Obama has also received his share of criticisms, but \"inconsequential\" isn't an adjective used to describe his tenure.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Democrats, Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, White House"}, "article_summary": "Clinton is \u201cdefined by littleness,\u201d Will said, adding, \u201cHe is the least consequential president\u201d since Calvin Coolidge in the 1920s.\nAnd if the nation elects a GOP successor for Obama, the next president may very well undo much of what this president has done.\nTom Brady may be a consequential quarterback, but if you\u2019re a Dolphins fan, you\u2019re probably not impressed.\nMore than a decade later, President Obama has also received his share of criticisms, but it\u2019s probably fair to say \u201cinconsequential\u201d is an adjective that no one will use to describe his tenure.\nThe first, as noted above, is that being \u201cconsequential\u201d is not evidence of an a priori good."}
