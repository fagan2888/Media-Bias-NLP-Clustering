It's red snapper season in Florida.

The 10 day stretch in June means anglers are flocking to federal waters, 9 miles off the coast, vying for bigger, better snapper.

But the season used to be much longer and many anglers are frustrated by the limitations.

The season began on June 1 for private anglers, but won't last long. Anglers are allowed two fish a piece. A limitation many say is too short and too few.

"I think the two fish per person is fine," said Walt Coward, an angler at Treasure Island Marina. "I think the biggest problem is the shortness of the season and not being able to go to the structures that you need to and to help the area be economically blessed."

The season has been set and shortened by the state's Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission over the years. Many fishermen and women believe the current regulations are unfair and that two snapper caught in federal waters could be very different from snapper caught in state waters.

"Snapper are running bigger [in federal waters]," said angler Bill Buchanan. "You look at some we've got here they're running eight to ten pounds in what we caught today. Yesterday we caught some twenty pounders."

The season for fishing in state waters was extended, which Buchanan says has helped. But many others think the extension doesn't serve the demand and that the snapper population might not be as depleted as it once was.

"It puts too much pressure on in-state waters," said Coward. "Where the fish are is in the federal waters on the structures that are offshore. There's plenty of structure for everybody to fish and get their limit of fish."

Coward said he thinks the season should be the same for both private and commercial fishermen.

Red snapper season for in-state waters will end on July 12 and open again on Saturdays and Sundays in September and October.
