You know, I have these vague recollections when Republicans were saying Obamacare would kill jobs and crush freedom, and bring about death panels. Turns out, we\u2019re still celebrating the 4th of July. The only difference is another sixteen million Americans can celebrate it with healthcare.\n\nThat\u2019s worth celebrating.\n\nThe Republic survived.\n\nLater, the President dropped another fact on the GOP, \u201cI just want to play back the tape. I want to play back the tape because we were told all these measures were going to destroy jobs and explode the deficit. Remember that? Remember when Republicans promised to bring unemployment down to six percent by 2017? So we\u2019ve got a record streak of private sector job growth, we\u2019ve cut the deficit by two-thirds, our stock market has more than doubled restoring 401(k)s for millions of families. This is progress. Step by step America is moving forward. Middle-class economics works.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama reminded the audience that the fight goes on to work towards an economy where everyone has a chance to succeed. He warned the American people that Republicans are going to be making a whole bunch of stuff up. He added, \u201cWhen I say a lot of stuff, I mean a lot of stuff.\u201d\n\nObama said that Republicans have so many candidates running that they\u2019ll have enough for an actual Hunger Games.\n\nThe speech was a part victory lap, and a partial reminder that the fight goes on because Republicans are going to be running on going back to the failed top-down economics of the past. He said, \u201cOne thing that the bus full of people who are fighting to lead the Republican ticket all share is that they keep coming up with the same old trickle down you\u2019re on your own economics they helped bring about the crisis in 2007-2008 in the first place. And I want to emphasize, I know some of them well. They\u2019re good people. It\u2019s just that their ideas are bad. And I want to emphasize that, we\u2019re one country. We\u2019re all on one team, so we\u2019re all one American family. But we all go for Thanksgiving and Uncle Harry starts saying something, and you say, \u2018Uncle Harry, that makes no sense at all.\u2019 You still love him. He\u2019s still a member of your family, but you got to correct him. You don\u2019t want to put him in charge of stuff.\u201d\n\nObama then listed a few of the bad Republican ideas like elimating taxes on the wealthiest Americans\u2019 investments while forcing everyone else to pay more in taxes. He called out Republicans on opposing the minimum wage while wanting to cut taxes for those at the top and cutting funding for education. He said that Republicans are still obsessed with repealing Obamacare.\n\nPresident Obama was in rare form in Wisconsin. The President brought the fireworks and his fact bombs made sure that Republicans are reminded of all of their failed predictions on the 4th of July.", "article_metadata": {"description": "President Obama delivered an epic speech in La Crosse, Wisconsin where he both celebrated his administration's successes while dropping numerous fact bombs on his Republican critics.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "President Obama delivered an epic speech in La Crosse, Wisconsin where he both celebrated his administration's successes while dropping numerous fact bombs on his Republican critics.", "title": "Obama Rolls In Wisconsin While Obliterating Republicans With A 4th Of July Fact Bomb", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2015/07/02/obama-rolls-wisconsin-obliterating-republicans-4th-july-fact-bomb.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/obama-wisconsin.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-02T15:23:59+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Issues,la crosse wisconsin,obama economic record,obama speech la crosse,obama wisconsin speech,President Obama,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,hillary clinton,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Issues", "published_time": "2015-07-02T15:23:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-02T15:23:59+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "la crosse wisconsin, obama economic record, obama speech la crosse, obama wisconsin speech, President Obama"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc483\"", "article_summary": "President Obama delivered an epic speech in La Crosse, Wisconsin where he both celebrated his administration\u2019s successes while dropping numerous fact bombs on his Republican critics.\nPresident Obama was in rare form in Wisconsin.\nThe President brought the fireworks and his fact bombs made sure that Republicans are reminded of all of their failed predictions on the 4th of July.\nHe warned the American people that Republicans are going to be making a whole bunch of stuff up.\nLater, the President dropped another fact on the GOP, \u201cI just want to play back the tape."}
