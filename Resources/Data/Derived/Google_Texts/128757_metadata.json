A 2013 survey of providers, doctors and hospitals reported a 75 to 150 day wait for payment, and 50 percent of patient obligations going unpaid. By 2019, write-offs will exceed $189 billion.\n\nThe billing experience is important to overall patient satisfaction, with those 96 percent of fully satisfied consumers saying they would return for future services, compared to 49 percent of the unsatisfied, according to a study highlighted by Hanson.\n\n\u201cWe cannot create the patient financial experience of the future without the back office functionality to support it,\u201d Hanson said.\n\nIn 2016, to make vision more demonstrable, the task force is asking for feedback, said John Showalter, MD, CIO and assistant professor of Medicine for the University of Mississippi Medical Center.\n\nThe task force wants to identify the gaps by identifying categories of activity involved in a typical episode of care, and to that end, have asked for case studies. The HIMSS task force will serve as a matchmaker between organizations that would like to develop and pilot solutions, he said.\n\nCase study submissions will reviewed by HIMSS senior management and the task force, and will be promoted on the HIMSS website, he said.\n\nTwitter: @SusanJMorse\n\nThis story is part of our ongoing coverage of the HIMSS16 conference.
