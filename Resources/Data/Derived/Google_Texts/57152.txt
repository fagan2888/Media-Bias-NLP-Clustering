As you know, the overall news about Obamacare is almost uniformly positive. Uninsurance rates are down, costs are under control, subsidies are working, etc. But that doesn't mean everything is perfect. Kaiser's latest survey, for example, highlights growing dissatisfaction with Obamacare coverage:

The number of people who are dissatisfied has gone up from 20 percent in 2014 to 31 percent this year. The main complaint is about premiums and deductibles. As it happens, premiums haven't actually increased all that much, but deductibles have, which means that even modest premium increases strike people as unfair.

As usual, I'd be cautious about drawing any conclusions from this. It's only a year or two of data, and the Obamacare market is still shaking out. Still, it's genuinely unfavorable newsâ€”except for conservatives, who finally have something bad they can point to without actually lying about it.
