She has devoted her career to work as a nurse practitioner for the Access Community Health Network, one of the region\u0092s largest clinical organizations serving low-income and medically underserved communities in Chicago and surrounding suburbs.\n\n\u0093It\u0092s the people who drew me here and it\u0092s the people who have kept me here,\u0094 said Doran, RN, CNM, APN. \u0093The patients fuel my fire, and allow me to do this.\u0094\n\nFounded more than two decades ago, Access started as a small group of clinics primarily serving residents of Chicago\u0092s public housing developments. It now has nearly 40 health centers throughout the city and in suburban Cook and DuPage counties, serving nearly 200,000 patients, largely from minority and low-income households. According to Access\u0092 website, 51% of its patients are Hispanic, 32% are African-American and 63% are female. Approximately 42% of the patients are children.\n\nAddressing healthcare disparities\n\nDonna Thompson, MSN, RN, has served as Access CEO for 10 years and in an executive capacity with the organization since the middle 1990s. She said Access\u0092 mission is focused on eliminating healthcare disparities for the populations it serves.\n\nThompson said a major challenge lies in helping those Access serves obtain health insurance coverage, whether through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act, and in helping clients embrace wellness for themselves and their children.\n\nThompson said Access is completing part of that mission through various initiatives, including the rollout of its new EPIC electronic medical records system. Spearheaded by Access\u0092 Chief Information Officer Julie Bonello, BSN, MS, and Chief Operating Officer Janie Gawrys, MSN, RN, CPHQ, the system allows the clinics to share patient records with various hospitals to create a continuum of care. Access has reached an agreement to govern such sharing with Mt. Sinai Hospital in Chicago, and the organization intends to reach similar agreements with up to four more hospitals by the end of the year, Thompson said.\n\nAdditionally, Access operates a call center to contact patients to remind them of upcoming appointments and reduce no shows, and has created smartphone apps to help patients manage their own care. Access also has renovated many of its clinics and built new facilities in economically troubled places like Chicago\u0092s Inglewood neighborhood, including some with pharmacies inside the clinic.\n\nAt the forefront of the mission are Access healthcare providers, Thompson said, which include more than 100 nurses, nurse practitioners and certified nurse midwives.\n\nThompson, Bonello and Gawrys, all come from nursing backgrounds and have used those experiences to shape the organization\u0092s development.\n\n\u0093I get the question alot: How do you learn to manage?\u0094 Thompson said. \u0093And I say, \u0091I learned it from the bedside.\u0092 As a nurse for 37 years, I learned very early on to work as part of a team, take in assessments, to listen, to overcommunicate and to ask the right questions. It\u0092s the same thing in leadership.\u0094\n\nThompson said the leadership team has developed strategies through the years to ensure patient care is enhanced outside the walls of the clinics through community education and partnerships with various community organizations.\n\nDeveloping relationships\n\nFor nurses like Doran, working at Access is more than just a job. She sees about 30 patients a day at two clinics in Chicago\u0092s North Lawndale and Brighton Park neighborhoods,\n\n\u0093Just because they don\u0092t have the same economic ability as others doesn\u0092t mean they don\u0092t get access to the same types of services and facilities,\u0094 Doran said. \u0093It\u0092s really what I like about working with Access.\u0094\n\nMany of the women she now sees are daughters, neighbors or friends of patients with whom she has developed relationships over the years, referred to her for both prenatal and primary care. \u0093This is what healthcare is supposed to be about: connections, relationships,\u0094 Doran said.\n\nSheila Harmon, MSN, RN, APN, CDE, of Lynwood, oversees operations at six Access clinics and also works as a diabetes educator. After more than a decade working in nursing for an endocrinology practice at a large local institution, Harmon brought her talents to Access where she works to help patients learn about and adopt lifestyle strategies, improving the health of individuals and entire neighborhoods in groups of up to 25 people at a time.\n\n\u0093I hear them say all the time, \u0091There are no other programs like this anywhere in the city,\u0092\u0094 Harmon said. \u0093I can\u0092t imagine doing anything else.\u0094\n\nJonathan Bilyk is a freelance writer.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Nurse.com News", "description": "Barbara Alif Doran moved from Pennyslvania to Chicago 13 years ago to take her first nursing job.
