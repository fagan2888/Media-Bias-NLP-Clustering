And for starters, as if facing the defending NBA champions isn\u2019t a tall enough task, the Nuggets will be charged with standing in the way of history.\n\nOn Sunday, the Golden State Warriors will bring a 14-0 record into the Pepsi Center. One more victory would tie them for the greatest start to a season in league history. Led by reigning MVP Steph Curry, who has elevated his game to another stratosphere this season, the Warriors have become performance art on hardwood, a motivated Beethoven with no designs on slowing down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a goal that\u2019s right here and now, and it\u2019s something that we want to experience,\u201d Curry told reporters after the Warriors beat the Chicago Bulls 106-94 on Friday night. \u201cIt\u2019d be a huge accomplishment (to set the record for best start) because doing something that hasn\u2019t been done in the history of the league is special. You never know if this opportunity will come back again. There are so many variables that go into winning this many in a row, especially at the start of the season.\u201d\n\nTwo NBA teams have started 15-0 \u2014 the 1948-49 Washington Capitals and the 1993-94 Houston Rockets. If the Warriors defeat the Nuggets on Sunday, they\u2019d be able to set the record with a victory at home over the woebegone Los Angeles Lakers on Tuesday.\n\nMalone, a former Warriors assistant, at this point would settle for finding more sustained effort from his team.\n\n\u201cI think we have some guys on this team who pick and choose when they play hard, and those guys aren\u2019t going to play,\u201d he said after Friday\u2019s loss to Phoenix, during which the Nuggets blew a 17-point second-half lead. \u201cYou play with effort or you don\u2019t play, and I didn\u2019t like the effort of a bunch of our guys tonight. I can\u2019t even fathom how, in a home game and up by 17, our guys could not play hard. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d\n\nAfter the Suns hit 15-of-27 shots from 3-point range Friday, Malone called his team\u2019s perimeter defense \u201ca joke.\u201d\n\nThings certainly don\u2019t get any easier against the Warriors, who entered Saturday averaging 12.3 made 3-pointers per game, by far the most in the league.\n\n\u201cWe just have to keep giving effort on the defensive end,\u201d Nuggets guard Gary Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s not on one person. It\u2019s on the whole team. We have to continue to get better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Warriors try to tie NBA\u2019s best-ever start Sunday at Nuggets", "title": "Warriors try to tie NBA\u2019s best-ever start Sunday at Nuggets", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/21/warriors-try-to-tie-nbas-best-ever-start-sunday-at-nuggets/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20151121__9fd18be64eec5634880f6a7067006360p1.jpg", "height": 529}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20151121__9fd18be64eec5634880f6a7067006360p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-21T14:48:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-21T21:11:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cYou play with effort or you don\u2019t play, and I didn\u2019t like the effort of a bunch of our guys tonight.\nMalone, a former Warriors assistant, at this point would settle for finding more sustained effort from his team.\nOne more victory would tie them for the greatest start to a season in league history.\nOn Sunday, the Golden State Warriors will bring a 14-0 record into the Pepsi Center.\nI can\u2019t even fathom how, in a home game and up by 17, our guys could not play hard."}
