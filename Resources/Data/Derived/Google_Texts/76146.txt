Recently, I made my 79th attempt to access my previously set up account at healthcare

.gov (the Health Insurance Marketplace for the Affordable Care Act/Obamacare) to examine Texas policies and rates and to obtain regime-mandated coverage to avoid IRS fines (or later, jail, if they have their way).

It ended the same way as the 78 tries that preceded it — failure. I have intentionally tried at all hours around the clock to avoid overload on the system. After attempt No. 50 failed, I tried the “online chat” feature. It was 3 a.m., and my chat began promptly.

The “navigator’s” help consisted of telling me to be patient and try again in a few days.

Amazon never tells me that.
