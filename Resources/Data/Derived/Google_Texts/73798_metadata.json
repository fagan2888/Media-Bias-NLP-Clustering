She noted that the effects of the increase would be based on how many units are in the Golden State, how much those companies already pay their California-based workers and whether franchisees or the company would have to sign those paychecks.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhile Starbucks and Chipotle have comparatively large exposures to the California market, they tend to employ relatively few workers at the minimum wage, limiting the direct negative effect,\u201d Senatore wrote. \u201cThe casual diners similarly tend to pay most of their workers more than the minimum wage, an effect of the tipped-wage arrangement.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn contrast, she noted that quick-service companies such as McDonald\u2019s Corp., Yum! Brands Inc. and The Wendy\u2019s Co. \u2014 which employ a large amount of workers at the minimum wage \u2014 are more vulnerable to a negative impact. However, she noted, \u201cThe diversity of their operations, particularly the global players, helps mitigate the overall impact.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to company reports and Bernstein Research estimates, Starbucks Corp., Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. and Yum have significant percentages of their total unit counts in the state of California, at 22.0 percent, 16.6 percent and 11.0 percent, respectively. McDonald\u2019s also has 9.6 percent of its restaurants located in California.\n\n\n\nThe next three chains listed by Bernstein have smaller overall unit counts but nonetheless have a large portion of their systems in California, including Brinker International Inc. with 9.5 percent, Panera Bread Co. with 8.2 percent and Darden Restaurants Inc. with 6.7 percent.\n\n\n\nWith 259 restaurants in California, or 4.5 percent of its system, Wendy\u2019s had the smallest exposure to the state\u2019s high cost of doing business among the restaurants in Bernstein\u2019s coverage universe.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat matters is your exposure to the state,\u201d Senatore said in an interview, \u201cand within that, your company-operated mix, and within that, to what extent are you paying minimum wage. \u2026 Generally, California\u2019s a tough market to make a lot of money, because costs do tend to be higher.\u201d\n\n\n\nRelatively higher wages paid already at Starbucks or Chipotle may limit the effect of California\u2019s decision, she said, though that would not necessarily prevent wage inflation from creeping in at those chains.\n\n\n\n\u201cThere always tends to be upward pressure,\u201d Senatore said. \u201cIf you have some minimum-wage employees, they\u2019re now making $10. If you had employees who were already making around $10, they\u2019ll expect the same kind of wage gap to continue.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe research note published in March found that Wendy\u2019s likely would feel the pressure of a minimum-wage increase as acutely if not more than other quick-service brands like the larger, more heavily franchised McDonald\u2019s and Yum! Brands Inc. However, it did not take into account Wendy\u2019s recent announcement that it would refranchise 425 company-owned locations, including many in California.\n\n\n\nA press release from The Cypress Group, an investment-banking outfit Wendy\u2019s has retained to assist in its refranchising transactions, disclosed that 51 locations in Los Angeles and Sacramento, Calif., were part of the 425-unit effort.\n\n\n\n\u201cGiven that Wendy\u2019s was doing its refranchising disproportionately toward where they\u2019ll see the most increased costs in the West and West Coast, that should be helpful,\u201d Senatore said.\n\n\n\nContact Mark Brandau at mark.brandau@penton.com.\n\nFollow him on Twitter: @Mark_from_NRN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Proposed increases\u2019 effects depend on pay structure, franchise ownership", "title": "Analyst: Restaurants can limit impact of California wage hike", "og": {"url": "http://nrn.com/government/analyst-restaurants-can-limit-impact-california-wage-hike", "image": "http://nrn.com/site-files/nrn.com/files/uploads/2013/09/stockhand-moneypromo_0.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "Effect of increase depends on pay structure, franchise ownership", "title": "Analyst: Restaurants can limit impact of California wage hike"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "7d22d9073ed6d094c7c5d663db02d457"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=593080516", "keywords": "California minimum wage, California restaurant operators, California restaurant operations, Finance, Franchising, H.R. & Training, Government, Latest Headlines, Weekly Wrap"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf439\"", "article_summary": "Brands Inc. and The Wendy\u2019s Co. \u2014 which employ a large amount of workers at the minimum wage \u2014 are more vulnerable to a negative impact.\nIn the emailed addendum, Senatore wrote that different restaurant companies would absorb the labor costs resulting from California\u2019s new minimum wage to different extents.\nThe impact of California\u2019s impending minimum wage increase on restaurant companies\u2019 bottom lines will vary by brand, but strategies like limiting exposure through franchising could mitigate those risks, a securities analyst recently noted.\n\u201cWhat matters is your exposure to the state,\u201d Senatore said in an interview, \u201cand within that, your company-operated mix, and within that, to what extent are you paying minimum wage.\n\u201cWhile Starbucks and Chipotle have comparatively large exposures to the California market, they tend to employ relatively few workers at the minimum wage, limiting the direct negative effect,\u201d Senatore wrote."}
