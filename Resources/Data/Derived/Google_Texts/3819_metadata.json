He and industrial leaders say the rules should be simplified to entice foreign business and boost manufacturing in India.\n\nModi passed an executive order in December doing away with some of the rules. The unilateral move upset opposition parties and rights groups that had long fought for legal safeguards on land acquisition, and they vowed to fight any effort to make the changes permanent after the order expired earlier this month.\n\nRights activists, labor unions and many among India\u2019s hundreds of millions of farmers say the changes effectively trample the rights of the poor. They accuse Modi of catering to corporate interests, and worry changing the law will leave them vulnerable to poor compensation packages or forced relocation from ancestral lands.\n\n\u201cWith the single-minded agenda of kneeling before the corporates \u2026 this government has shown that it simply does not care for the poor and toiling people, for our land, agriculture and nature,\u201d the National Alliance of People\u2019s Movements said in a statement.\n\nThe opposition Congress party \u2014 in power when the 2013 law was passed \u2014 has seized on the issue as it struggles to repair its political image following its stunning election defeat last year to Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Both Gandhi family scion Rahul and his mother, party leader Sonia, addressed the rallying farmers at a protest park in central New Delhi on Sunday.\n\nRahul accused Modi of winning the election with funding from industrialists he now needs to pay back.\n\n\u201cHow will he pay back the loan now? He will do it by giving your lands to those top industrialists. He wants to weaken the farmers, then snatch their land and give it to his industrialist friends,\u201d Rahul Gandhi, speaking Hindi, told more than 50,000 cheering farmers who came to the rally from all over India.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Indian farmers protest gov\u2019t plans to ease land acquisition", "title": "Indian farmers protest gov\u2019t plans to ease land acquisition", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Indian farmers protest gov\u2019t plans to ease land acquisition", "title": "Indian farmers protest gov\u2019t plans to ease land acquisition", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/04/19/indian_farmers_protest_govt_plans_to_ease_land_acquisition/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/india-politics.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Indian farmers protest gov\u2019t plans to ease land acquisition", "title": "Indian farmers protest gov\u2019t plans to ease land acquisition", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/04/india-politics.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Katy Daigle", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe3dfa\"", "article_summary": "Rights activists, labor unions and many among India\u2019s hundreds of millions of farmers say the changes effectively trample the rights of the poor.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has said existing rules, established in 2013 to protect land owners from land grabbing and forced relocation, were creating obstacles that were spooking investors.\nHe and industrial leaders say the rules should be simplified to entice foreign business and boost manufacturing in India.\nTopics: From the Wires, NewsNEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 Tens of thousands of flag-waving farmers rallied in India\u2019s capital Sunday to protest a government plan to ease rules for obtaining land for industry and development projects.\nBoth Gandhi family scion Rahul and his mother, party leader Sonia, addressed the rallying farmers at a protest park in central New Delhi on Sunday."}
