Huron, SD

Saturday concludes the 25th Red Power Round Up at the South Dakota State Fairgrounds in Huron.

The event, which started Wednesday, is a traveling showcase that visits different states each year. The event includes over one thousand exhibits, featuring anything from agricultural memorabilia to quilts and household goods. Co-Chairman Steve Masat says there's one main reason people come to the Red Power Round Up.

"To be honest with you, friends. It's been a lot of work, and I had kind of made my mind up, well I'm not going to Missouri next year, but after I come see all my friends here, I'm going," Masat said.

Masat says this year's event brought representatives from seven different countries to South Dakota. The last time the Red Power Round Up visited the state was 1997.
