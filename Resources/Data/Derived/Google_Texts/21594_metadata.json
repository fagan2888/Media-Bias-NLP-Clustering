Including debt, the total value of the deal is about $8.7 billion, the statement shows.\n\nBC Partners beat other bidders including Leon Black\u0092s Apollo Global Management and KKR & Co. to close the deal after a weekslong auction that came down to negotiations over the weekend, people with knowledge of the matter said. BC Partners struck a deal on Sunday, after making a final offer a day earlier that topped other bids, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information.\n\n\u0093It was a very competitive auction,\u0094 Raymond Svider, a managing partner at BC Partners, said in a telephone interview. \u0093The company should never have been put in play. Growth slowed and the market overreacted. We feel fortunate.\u0094\n\nA spokesman for Apollo declined to comment, as did a representative for Jana and a spokeswoman for KKR. In addition to BC Partners, the consortium includes Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t et Placement du Qu\u00e9bec and StepStone.\n\nThe sale is a victory for Jana and Longview Asset Management, which also urged the retailer to sell itself as its business waned. Same-store sales at the pet-supply company were flat last quarter after falling in the previous three months for the first time in at least a decade, as competition from Amazon.com Inc. and other retailers intensified.\n\nUntil Jana, the $10 billion hedge fund run by Barry Rosenstein, began its campaign on July 3, PetSmart\u0092s shares had tumbled 18 percent in 2014. Longview, which controls about 9 percent of PetSmart, said later that month it also backed a sale. Longview supports the sale to BC Partners, according to the statement.\n\nShares of Phoenix-based PetSmart have now gained 6.8 percent this year, closing at $77.67 on Dec. 12, compared with an 8.3 percent gain in the Standard & Poor\u0092s 500 Index.\n\nIncluding debt, the buyout group is paying about 9.3 times PetSmart\u0092s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization in the 12 months through Nov. 2, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a median of 8.9 times historic Ebitda paid in 24 buyouts of U.S. consumer companies over $1 billion in the last five years.\n\nThe private-equity deal tops Blackstone Group LP\u0092s $5.4 billion purchase of industrial-products maker Gates Global LLC in July, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Buyout firms have held off on making purchases this year, as valuations climb with stock benchmarks that have reached records.\n\nPetSmart made a good buyout candidate because of its high free-cash-flow yield -- a measure of how much cash from operations the business generates relative to its share price, analysts have said. Petco Animal Supplies Inc., a PetSmart competitor, was acquired by private-equity investors led by Leonard Green & Partners in 2006, and buyout firms also may be interested in PetSmart thanks in part to an attractive financing market, Jana said in July.\n\nFor more information on related topics, visit the following:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/financial_sponsors/petsmart-agrees-to-bc-partners-83-billion-takeover-bid-253877-1.html", "image": "http://cdn.themiddlemarket.com/media/newspics/Petsmart-snippet.jpg", "site_name": "Mergers & Acquisitions, Latest News", "title": "PetSmart Agrees to BC Partners\u2019 $8.3 Billion Takeover Bid"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcab11\"", "article_summary": "PetSmart Agrees to BC Partners\u2019 $8.3 Billion Takeover BidBC Partners beat other bidders including Leon Black\u0092s Apollo Global Management and KKRPetSmart Inc. agreed to be bought by a group led by BC Partners for about $8.3 billion in the largest leveraged deal for a U.S. company this year.\n\u0093It was a very competitive auction,\u0094 Raymond Svider, a managing partner at BC Partners, said in a telephone interview.\nIn addition to BC Partners, the consortium includes Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t et Placement du Qu\u00e9bec and StepStone.\nLongview supports the sale to BC Partners, according to the statement.\nBC Partners struck a deal on Sunday, after making a final offer a day earlier that topped other bids, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing private information."}
