Many of the reforms available to states\u2014such as setting a health care cost growth goal or establishing a statewide scorecard\u2014can be accomplished at little to no cost but are capable of making a big impact. Others, such as scaling evidence-based home visiting statewide, require upfront investments but then pay for themselves in future cost savings. States are natural leaders in this space, since they have considerable authority over the regulation of health insurance and the provision of health care within their borders.\n\nAs CAP notes in the report, a number of states are already innovating in this area and seeing positive results for local government, health care providers and payers, and consumers. Maryland and Massachusetts are among the state leaders in setting forth cost control reforms, but they are not alone in improving the quality and sustainability of their health care systems. With health care costs projected to grow faster than the overall economy, CAP\u2019s report details how nearly two dozen other states are undertaking efforts to alleviate this pressure on their budgets and services.\n\n\u201cWe know the Affordable Care Act is working, but we need to do more to sustain the slowdown. Otherwise, spending on health care will continue to crowd out other important investments,\u201d said Topher Spiro, Vice President for Health Policy at CAP. \u201cStates should seize these opportunities to provide better care at lower cost.\u201d\n\nThe report includes a comprehensive summary of options for state governments to consider and examples of how some states are already putting these ideas into action:\n\nEstablish a cost growth goal (Massachusetts, Maryland, and Rhode Island)\n\nPublish a health and cost outcomes scorecard (Maryland and Oregon)\n\nAdopt payment and delivery system reform goals (Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island, and California)\n\nImplement bundled payments for all payers (Arkansas, Tennessee, Ohio, and Delaware)\n\nInstitute global budgets for hospitals (Maryland)\n\nLaunch all-payer claims databases (Maine, Colorado, New Hampshire, and Washington)\n\nExpand evidence-based home visiting services (Minnesota and South Carolina)\n\nImprove price transparency (New Hampshire and Massachusetts)\n\nIntegrate behavioral health and primary care (Oregon, Washington, and Colorado)\n\nCombat addiction to prescription drugs and heroin (Maryland, Florida, New York, and Rhode Island)\n\nImprove the delivery of long-term care (California, Maryland, Montana, Oregon, Texas, and Missouri)\n\nAlign scope of practice with community needs\n\nInstitute reference pricing in the state employee plan (California)\n\nExpand the use of telehealth (Maryland, New York, Virginia, the District of Columbia, and Pennsylvania)\n\nDecrease unnecessary emergency room use (Georgia, New Mexico, Indiana, Minnesota, Washington, and Wisconsin)\n\nRead the full report, \u201cState Options to Control Health Care Costs and Improve Quality\u201d by Zeke Emanuel, Joshua Sharfstein, Topher Spiro, and Meghan O\u2019Toole, online here.\n\nRelated resources:\n\nFor more information on this topic or to speak with an expert, contact Liz Bartolomeo at lbartolomeo@americanprogress.org or 202.481.8151.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "name", "description": "Washington, D.C. \u2014 A new report from the Center for American Progress outlines how states are well-positioned to be leaders in implementing policies to help control health care costs and improve quality.
