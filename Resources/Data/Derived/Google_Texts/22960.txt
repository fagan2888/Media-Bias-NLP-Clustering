People can get quite religious about their pets.

So, last night at Klyde Warren Park, St. Bernards to Chihuahuas to lime green parakeets to sleek Greyhounds filled the park for an official blessing from Father Rudy Garcia, the rector of the Cathedral Shrine of the Virgin of Guadalupe.

The Blessing of the Animals is part of the observation of the feast day of St. Francis of Assisi, a Catholic friar from Italy known as the patron saint of animals and the environment. The new Pope Francis of the Catholic Church takes his name and inspiration from that saint, as well, and spent his day in Assisi, Italy.

The ceremony in the Dallas arts district included a few pastors from nearby churches and two Dallas city council politicos and one little nine-year-old boy named Jesus Lopez with a squirming Chihuahua mix named Canela, cinnamon in Spanish.
