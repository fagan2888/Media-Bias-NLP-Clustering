Wall Street Journal reporters John Emshwiller and Gary Fields have uncovered a largely unnoticed but extremely important consequence of the decades-long war on crime: In the past 20 years, their reporting found, authorities have made more than a quarter billion arrests.

About 80 million individuals – nearly one in every three adults – have a criminal record on file with the FBI.

Mr. Emshwiller and Mr. Fields answered questions in a Reddit AMA. Read the AMA here.

The impact of this has been huge, affecting people’s ability to get jobs, housing, admission to college, professional licenses and loans, among other repercussions

The damage has been magnified by the rise of the Internet, which has made access to criminal-records information far more available. A generation ago, someone had to go to a court house and sift through paper records. Now, a computer search can turn up such information in seconds.

Their reporting also found that the law-enforcement crackdown turned many juvenile offenses that were once viewed as worth nothing more than a visit to the principal’s office into crimes that could burden a kid’s future.

For many adults, their criminal records were being created in courts that often failed to provide due-process rights guaranteed by the Constitution, including the right to have a defense attorney.

The failure to ensure such rights raised questions about whether people were being convicted of crimes they didn’t commit.
