Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, the private medical campus where Thomas Eric Duncan is currently under care and isolation, still can\u2019t explain exactly how medical staff let the 42-year-old Liberian national go home with useless antibiotics. Hospital officials have only said that Duncan\u2019s travel history wasn\u2019t \u201ccommunicated,\u201d and now mainstream media reports are stuck on everything from malfunctions in Presbyterian Hospital\u2019s electronic record system to Duncan being dishonest about the level of his Ebola exposure when he left Liberia.\n\nBut few want to touch the pointy eggshells of race and class in the frantic discussion over Ebola as it enters the United States. Did Duncan get initially turned away because he is black and, possibly, uninsured?\n\nWould it have been different if Duncan had been white and insured?\n\nWe may never know for sure, and it\u2019s unclear if Duncan had insurance (it\u2019s unlikely, considering that he\u2019s a Liberian national on a U.S. visa).\n\nWhat we do know is that Ebola response in the U.S. is under enormous scrutiny as experts wonder if an already challenged health system\u2014currently undergoing an Affordable Care Act renovation\u2014is really all that prepared for something that is scaring us like a Contagion script. And the specter of race is lurking not too far behind: When white American aid doctors in West Africa showed signs of the virus, they were rushed back to the U.S. ... stat. The same happened when a white freelance cameraman for NBC News in Liberia was immediately flagged for treatment.\n\nBut it\u2019s been rough going for black Ebola sufferers\u2014even when one manages to sneak into the U.S. and access one of the most advanced health care systems in the world.\n\nFormer District of Columbia Chief Medical Officer Dr. Ivan Walks, who led the response against Washington, D.C.\u2019s first bioterrorism attack, believes it\u2019s a question we need to start asking. \u201cI was stunned,\u201d Walks tells The Root. \u201cYou could put [Duncan\u2019s] picture in the dictionary under what you look for when responding to Ebola. How do you miss that guy?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where factors such as Duncan\u2019s race and level of insurance could have influenced the hospital\u2019s first decision in either subtle or not-so-subtle ways. \u201cThere is a lot of research showing that different people get turned away in different places,\u201d argues Walks. \u201cSo if they turned him away at first because he\u2019s an African with no insurance, that would not be inconsistent with what we\u2019ve seen over the years.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.subheadline": "As the condition of patient Thomas Eric Duncan in Dallas deteriorates, serious questions are being raised about why he was turned away from a hospital after his initial complaints of illness.", "sailthru.tags": "ebola, Thomas Eric Duncan, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, Dallas Texas, Liberia, anthrax, postal workers, NIH budget cut, sequestration, Gov.
