COLORADO SPRINGS — A woman accused of hitting and killing a 5-year-old boy as he walked with his father on a sidewalk in Colorado Springs has pleaded not guilty to vehicular homicide and reckless driving.

The Gazette reports 21-year-old Xyrjah Goldston entered her pleas Friday in the July death of Ishaq Hameed. The boy’s father, Raphael Hameed, also was hit and lost the lower portion of a leg.

Prosecutors say Goldston was speeding and lost control of her car when she tried to overcorrect on a curve. Her trial is scheduled to begin May 11.
