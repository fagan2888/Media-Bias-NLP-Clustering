But by Monday afternoon, Small was in urgent care. She was sent home, but returned later on in the night suffering from headaches. \u201cIn the middle of the night, she woke up complaining of headaches and stuff,\u201d Devan Rook, 18, a classmate of Small\u2019s, told The Washington Post. He said due to the seriousness of her condition, she had to be moved from Inova Loudoun Hospital to Inova Fairfax Hospital. \u201cAt that point, she wasn\u2019t doing too well, and several of her organs were shutting down.\u201d\n\nThe Virginia Northern District Medical Examiner\u2019s office returned with its autopsy results earlier than expected, saying on Friday the cause of death was natural, from rare Neisseria sepsis \u2014 a bloodstream infection. Sepsis only occurs in five to 20 percent of those who contract an invasive meningococcal infection, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The infection is typically characterized by sudden onset of fever, bruise-like rashes, stiff neck, and headaches, all of which result from the bacteria attacking the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, called meninges.\n\nWhile there\u2019s been a rise in concerned residents calling the Loudoun County Health Department, officials said there was no evidence of a meningitis outbreak in the community. Broad Run High School officials also said they were working with the Department to ensure no one else would become sick.\n\nIn the meantime, people throughout the community have also shown an overwhelming amount of support for Small and her family. Many students at her school wore pink on Friday to remember her, and her softball teammates posted a banner in their gym saying, \u201cWe Play For #24,\u201d a phrase that\u2019s since gone viral on Twitter.\n\nLFC plays for Madison #WEplayfor24 pic.twitter.com/IjZS3jz3Ai \u2014 aly rose (@Alyrestivo) April 11, 2015\n\nThe bacteria is spread by inhaling airborne droplets that came from someone who sneezed or coughed. Health Department officials emphasized the importance of washing hands frequently and getting vaccinated. \u201cThe most effective way to protect you and your child against certain types of bacterial meningitis is to complete the recommended vaccine schedule,\u201d said Health Department Director Dr. David Goodfriend, according to CBS. \u201cIn addition to vaccination, the best way to prevent the spread of meningococcal meningitis is to not share personal items and to wash hands frequently, especially before eating.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "bacterial, meningitis, blame, virgnia, high, school, seniors, mysterious, sudden, death", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "A Virginia high school senior's mysterious sudden death has been attributed to a bacterial meningitis infection.", "title": "Virginia Student's Sudden Death Caused By Bacterial Meningitis", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bacterial-meningitis-blame-virgnia-high-school-seniors-mysterious-sudden-death-328894", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/11/madison-small.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Virginia high school senior's mysterious sudden death has been attributed to a bacterial meningitis infection.", "title": "Virginia Student's Sudden Death Caused By Bacterial Meningitis", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/bacterial-meningitis-blame-virgnia-high-school-seniors-mysterious-sudden-death-328894", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/11/madison-small.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/11/madison-small.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-04-11T14:10:15-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-11T14:14:07-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "A Virginia high school senior's mysterious sudden death has been attributed to a bacterial meningitis infection."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3c8\"", "article_summary": "Broad Run High School officials also said they were working with the Department to ensure no one else would become sick.\nHealth Department officials emphasized the importance of washing hands frequently and getting vaccinated.\nWhile there\u2019s been a rise in concerned residents calling the Loudoun County Health Department, officials said there was no evidence of a meningitis outbreak in the community.\nSmall, a senior at Broad Run High School, was doing just fine on Sunday, her father Tim Small said \u2014 in fact, the two were playing catch.\n\u201cThe most effective way to protect you and your child against certain types of bacterial meningitis is to complete the recommended vaccine schedule,\u201d said Health Department Director Dr. David Goodfriend, according to CBS."}
