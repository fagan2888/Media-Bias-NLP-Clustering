Arizona froze its KidsCare program in 2010 to save money during a state budget crunch. It once covered more than 63,000 children, but fewer than 1,000 now have the insurance.\n\nSenate President Andy Biggs has blocked the proposal despite it passing overwhelmingly in the House because he's opposed to the Affordable Care Act and is worried the federal government will cut payments and force Arizona to pick up more of the tab. The federal government is paying for 100 percent of the plan through 2017, and the proposal allows the state to stop the program if federal funding drops.\n\nBiggs said in interviews with The Associated Press and on Arizona PBS' Horizon public affairs show last week that he has no intention of allowing House Bill 2309 to move forward. It passed the House on a 47-12 vote on March 2.\n\nBiggs said it isn't that easy to cut off insurance if federal funding drops once 30,000 or so children are insured.\n\n\"What you do is you create a constituency of 30,000 to 50,000, could be as many as 50,000 people,\" Biggs said last week. \"And now you pull the trigger and take them off? The answer is that's not going to happen. Nobody will pull that trigger.\"\n\nHe also said many children could qualify for private insurance sold through the Affordable care Act exchanges.\n\n\"The argument that's being made to us is, get this: it's too expensive,\" the Republican said. \"The exchange is too expensive. Well, are you telling me that the Affordable Care Act is not so?\"\n\nThe bill is sponsored by an Arizona House Republican who says the parents of eligible children are the working poor, people making $11 or $12 an hour who make too much to qualify for the state's Medicaid program but who do not qualify or can't afford for subsidized health insurance on the federal marketplace.\n\n\"Those children, this is what we're here for, is to help the working poor,\" Rep. Regina Cobb, a Kingman Republican, said at Monday's rally. \"These are families, of a mom and a dad where the dad's the only worker and doesn't make but $9 or $10 an hour and can't afford health insurance. Or this is a mom, a single mom, with a child or two, who is making a decision on whether or not to have heat, whether or not to pay rent, or whether to have health insurance.\"\n\nChildren whose families earn between 138 and 200 percent of the federal poverty line would gain insurance under the plan.\n\nGov. Doug Ducey's spokesman, Daniel Scarpinato, has said the governor has concerns about its fiscal impact on ongoing state revenue and on the flexibility to make future budget decisions. But he has not made a definitive statement on whether he would sign the legislation if it hit his desk.\n\nParticipants at Monday's rally included parents, pediatricians, nurses, faith and women's groups and the Children's Action Alliance, a nonprofit group focused on children's health.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "American Press, Press, newspaper, paper, media, Lake Charles, Calcasieu, Cameron, Beauregard, Jeff Davis, Allen, Southwest Louisiana, Louisiana, Lake Area, community events in Southwest Louisiana, stories, photography, journalism, reporting, pictures, videos, news, sports, entertainment, life, obits, health, politics, crime, police, festivals, events, breaking, blogs, entertainment, arts, marquee, parish, coverage, McNeese, Cowboys, LSU, Tigers, college football, prep, high school, football, baseball, basketball, soccer, hockey, NASCAR, NFL, Saints, New Orleans, weddings, printing, engagements, anniversaries, shutter bugs, bragging rights, classifieds, advertising, rates, ads, real estate, automobiles, garage sales, comics, sales, retail, local, coupons, discount, deals, Anacoco, Barbe, Basile, Bell City, Bethel Christian, DeQuincy, DeRidder, East Beauregard, Elizabeth, Elton, Evans, Fairview, Grand Lake, Hackberry, Hamilton Christian, Hathaway, Hicks, Hyatt, Iota, Iowa, Jennings, Johnson Bayou, Kinder, Lacassine, LaGrange, Lake Arthur, Leesville, Merryville, Midland, Oakdale, Oberlin, Pickering, Pitkin, Reeves, Rosepine, St. Louis, Sam Houston, Simpson, Singer, South Beauregard, South Cameron, Starks, Sulphur, Vinton, Washington-Marion, Welsh, Westlake, Plainview, Ararat, Belfield, Bell City, Bellevue, Big Woods, Bon Air, Bridge Junction, Brimstone, Buhler, Carlyss, Chalkley, Chloe, DeQuincy, Edgerly, Ged, Gillis, Goosport, Goss, Greinwich Village, Hargrove, Hayes, Hecker, Hipple, Hollywood, Holmwood, Iowa, Lake Charles, Le Bleu, Lockmoor, Lucas, Lunita, Mallard Junction, Manchester, Maplewood, Moss Bluff, Moss Lake, Mossville, Newton, Niblett Bluff, Perkins, Prien, Rose Bluff, Rossignol, Starks, Stegall, Sulphur, Toomey, University Place, Verret, Vinton, Westlake, Cameron, Creole, Gibbstown, Grand Chenier, Grand Lake, Hackberry, Holly Beach, Illinois Plant, Lone Pine, Lowry, North Island, Oak Grove, Peveto Beach, Sweet Lake, Bancroft, Bivens, Bon Ami, Carson, DeRidder, Dry Creek, Fields, Fulton, Gaytine, Gordon, Helme, Hite, Ikes, Juanita, Junction, Kernan, Longville, Ludington, Merryville, Neale, Oretta, Ragley, Seale, Shear, Singer, Sugartown, Tulla, Turps, , Barnsdall, Buller, China, Edna, Elton, Fenton, Fontenot, Foremans Hall, Hathaway, Jennings, Lacassine, Lake Arthur, Niblett, Panchoville, Pine Island, Raymond, Roanoke, Silverwood, Thornwell, Topsy, Welsh, Woodlawn, Bel, Bond, Elder, Elizabeth, Foley, Grant, Hampton, Harmony, Indian Village, Kinder, Lauderdale, Le Blanc, Mittie, Oakdale, Oberlin, Pawnee, Reeves, Reids, Simmons Settlement, Stanley, Ward, Warren Arceneaux, Michael Cooper, Eric Cormier, Bobby Dower, Jim Gazzolo, John Guidroz, Laura Heller, Alex Hickey, Scooter Hobbs, Johnathan Manning, Andrew Perzo, Informer, Natalie Stewart", "google-site-verification": "A7PixE80w7ozjQvQ1VVILSIF1XElrnpDPkBzxNP4PLY", "description": "PHOENIX -- A fight is intensifying in the Arizona Legislature over the Senate leader's refusal to restore a program providing health insurance to poor children, a decision that would maintain the stat ...", "p": {"domain_verify": "8346ce6bb2563b1ecb0a1e70c3d14984"}, "title": "Backers fight for children's health insurance in Arizona"}, "article_summary": "\"These are families, of a mom and a dad where the dad's the only worker and doesn't make but $9 or $10 an hour and can't afford health insurance.\nBiggs said in interviews with The Associated Press and on Arizona PBS' Horizon public affairs show last week that he has no intention of allowing House Bill 2309 to move forward.\nBiggs said it isn't that easy to cut off insurance if federal funding drops once 30,000 or so children are insured.\nHe also said many children could qualify for private insurance sold through the Affordable care Act exchanges.\nArizona froze its KidsCare program in 2010 to save money during a state budget crunch."}
