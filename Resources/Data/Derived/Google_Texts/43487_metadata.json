In the first half of this year alone, 59 tainted dietary supplements were posted on the FDA\u2019s site.\n\nIn July, the U.S. Department of Justice took court action against two supplement companies in Montana and Iowa for illegally selling or distributing prohibited or misbranded products. While some violations prompt legal action, regulators acknowledged that they are overmatched in their ability to monitor the supplements.\n\nThe FDA said the tainted supplements in its database are a small fraction of the potentially hazardous products with hidden ingredients marketed to consumers on the Internet and in retail establishments.\n\nU.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal is calling for a crackdown on the dietary supplements industry. He is working with Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin to reintroduce the Dietary Supplement Labeling Act, which, Blumenthal said, would help consumers distinguish between supplements that are safe and those that may have serious side effects or drug interactions. The bill would require more information on product labels and give more authority to the FDA to require manufacturers to register their products and ingredients and provide proof of any health-benefit claims.\n\n\u201cThe dietary supplement market is a dangerous Wild West of inadequate regulation\u201d that deprives consumers \u201cof basic health and safety information\u201d and results \u201cin serious injuries and deaths,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cWithout more transparency regarding the dangers of these products -- and more scrutiny over the often outrageous health benefit claims -- consumers simply have no way to know what they are taking.\u201d\n\nIndustry leaders said, however, that an overwhelming majority of companies sell safe products that include no illegal ingredients and are beneficial to millions of Americans.\n\nSteve Mister, president and CEO of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group that represents supplement manufacturers, said the 150 \u201clegitimate, mainstream\u201d companies in his organization are responsible for a majority of industry sales and are committed to quality products and compliance with federal regulations.\n\nMost adults ingest dietary supplements, which the FDA defines as vitamins, minerals, herbs, extracts and other products \u201cthat aim to add nutritional value to a diet.\u201d\n\nDuring the past 15 years, the industry has exploded in popularity, pushing annual sales to $35 billion, according to the trade group. About 150 million adults nationally, or seven out of every ten, ingest dietary supplements, the organization said. The supplements are sold in various forms, tablets, capsules, powders, energy bars and liquids.\n\nUnlike drugs, which are subject to FDA approval, companies can manufacture and sell supplements without the agency\u2019s approval. The FDA can take action if a dietary supplement contains undeclared ingredients, is found unsafe or if there are false or misleading claims about it.\n\nConcerns about the safety of dietary supplements were raised after a pre-mature infant died in October 2014 in a Connecticut hospital after being treated with a probiotic supplement that was found to contain mold. In November, FDA scientists confirmed the presence of a mold species, Rhizopus oryzae, in unopened containers of Solgar ABC Dophilus Powder, which had been collected at the Connecticut hospital where the infant died. The FDA did not reveal the name of the child or the hospital.\n\nAccording to the FDA, the infant \u201csuffered from gastrointestinal mucormycosis,\u201d a fungal infection, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determined that mold caused the mucormycosis. Both agencies issued warnings following the infant\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe contaminant at issue was not identified at any point within the product\u2019s supply chain under Solgar\u2019s control,\u201d said Andrea Staub, a spokeswoman for NBTY, the company that owns Solgar.\n\nStaub said the findings were determined after \u201cnumerous facility and equipment inspections,\u201d a review of operating procedures and tests of product samples by the FDA, CDC, independent laboratories and Solgar.\n\nBlumenthal said the infant\u2019s death underlines the need for better oversight of the supplements industry.\n\n\"The dietary supplement market is a dangerous Wild West of inadequate regulation,\" said U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal.\n\nThe FDA stated that \u201csome supplements are useful in reducing the risk of certain diseases\u201d and can make related claims on their labels. For example, folic acid supplements may make a claim about reducing the risk of birth defects of the brain and spinal cord.\n\nDietary supplements \u201care not intended to treat, diagnose, cure or alleviate the effects of diseases,\u201d according to the FDA.\n\nMister said small companies, particularly many that sell their products on the Internet, are giving the industry a bad rap. The \u201cfringes of the industry\u201d sell products they call dietary supplements to \u201cget them under the FDA\u2019s radar screen\u201d but include anabolic steroids or other illegal drugs, Mister said.\n\nSupplements marketed for weight loss, bodybuilding and sexual enhancement, which are often labeled as \u201call natural,\u201d are the most frequent violators, the FDA said.\n\nC-HIT\u2019s analysis of another FDA database found numerous warning letters sent in recent years to dietary supplement manufacturers, including four in Connecticut. Warning letters are issued for significant violations that \u201cmay lead to enforcement action if not promptly and adequately corrected.\u201d\n\nIn July 2014, the FDA issued a warning letter to Klein Laboratories after inspecting its manufacturing facility in North Haven. The label for the company\u2019s bodybuilding product, Osteojuv, \u201crevealed serious violations\u201d of federal regulations, including claims that it targets pain and inflammation, according to the FDA. Klein Laboratories did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn May 2012, a warning letter was sent to Middletown-based NatureMost of New England because its C-Complex tablets \u201cfailed to establish\u201d required \u201ccomponent specifications for identity, purity, strength and composition.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s CEO, Robert Trigo, said his \u201cproducts have always been above board,\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s very easy to get a warning letter\u201d for many reasons. He said the product was discontinued.\n\nA May 2011 warning letter was issued to Farmington-based Prostar after FDA inspectors \u201cfound a number of violations\u201d of manufacturing regulations, including Prostar\u2019s \u201crelease\u201d of two bodybuilding products, Ultra Ripped capsules and Higher Power 100% Whey Power protein shake, before product testing was completed and reviewed.\n\nBrian Rubino, Prostar\u2019s vice president, said that the company submitted a corrective action plan that the FDA approved.\n\nIn February 2011, the FDA issued a warning letter to Middletown-based RHG 7 Company, which operates under the name Vital Nutrients. The agency said the company\u2019s four supplements were \u201cprepared, packed or held under conditions\u201d that did not meet federal regulations. In 2008, the FDA also sent a warning letter to the company pointing out its DMSA dietary supplement was a drug.\n\nSarah Roller, a lawyer representing Vital Nutrients, said the company \u201cpromptly and successfully\u201d resolved both matters. After the 2011 warning letter, Vital Nutrients \u201cknuckled down\u201d and was told by the FDA that it was in compliance with federal regulations. After the 2008 warning, the company \u201cimmediately discontinued\u201d use of DMSA and hasn\u2019t used the ingredient since, she said.\n\nThis story was reported under a partnership with the Connecticut Health I-Team (chit.org).", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Every week for the past seven-and-a-half years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has identified an average of two dietary supplements being sold to", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/tainted-dietary-supplements-frequently-hit-market-lacking-close-oversight", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201509/dietary_supplement_medicine.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Every week for the past seven-and-a-half years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has identified an average of two dietary supplements being sold to", "title": "Tainted Dietary Supplements Frequently Hit a Market Lacking Close Oversight"}, "org_id": 0, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary"}, "author": "Gary Stoller", "wordCount": 1652, "dc": {"title": "Tainted Dietary Supplements Frequently Hit a Market Lacking Close Oversight"}, "nid": 47098, "datePublished": "2015-09-21", "story_id": 442192350, "keywords": "consumers, safety, retail, The Daily, Connecticut, industry, wellness", "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdbcf\"", "article_summary": "In the first half of this year alone, 59 tainted dietary supplements were posted on the FDA\u2019s site.\nAbout 150 million adults, or seven out of every ten, ingest dietary supplements, according to a national trade group.\nC-HIT\u2019s analysis of FDA data revealed 615 dietary supplements that were identified as tainted since January 1, 2008.\nAbout 150 million adults nationally, or seven out of every ten, ingest dietary supplements, the organization said.\nSenator Richard Blumenthal is calling for a crackdown on the dietary supplements industry."}
