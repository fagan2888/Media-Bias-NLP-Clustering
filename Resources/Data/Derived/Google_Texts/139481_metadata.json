Dimon doesn't just use the blanket CEO \"uncertainty\" excuse for why growth is tepid, he prefers to get into the weeds.\n\n\"Of course there is risk in the system,\" he writes \"There always was, and there always will be. As a company, we need to be prepared for even the unlikely and unpredictable bad outcomes. But like everything else, it helps to put risk into perspective.\"\n\nNow for what's going right in the United States:\n\n\u2022 Consumers are in increasingly good financial shape. Over 6 million more Americans are working since the depths of the financial crisis. The amount of consumer income that they spend to service their debt is the lowest it has been since it has been recorded, dating back to 1980. And Americans\u2019 net worth has been increasing, along with stock market prices and the value of homes.\n\n\u2022 Housing has turned the corner in most markets. We\u2019ve moved from a buyer\u2019s market to a seller\u2019s market in four years, construction of new homes has steadily improved and home values have increased nationally more than 19% in the past two years due to the strengthening economy. \u2022 Capital markets are wide open \u2013 credit, for the most part, is flowing freely. (The only exception I see here is that it still is too hard to get a mortgage for many people.)\n\n\u2022 Corporations and middle market companies are in extremely good shape. Corporate cash balances now are 11.4% of assets, up from 5.2% in 2000.\n\n\u2022 The banking system is almost fully recovered, and banks are better capitalized than they have been in 60 years. Banks had average equity to assets of 11.1% in 2013 \u2013 the highest it\u2019s been since 1950. And banks in total have $10 trillion in deposits vs. $7.6 trillion in loans today \u2013 the lowest loan-to-deposit ratio since 1970. In addition, banks currently hold HQLA of approximately $2 trillion.\n\n\u2022 Consumers are benefiting from abundant and less costly oil and gas due to technological advances in extraction.\n\nAnd what's wrong with the United States:\n\n\u2022 Concerns around excessive regulation and red tape \u2013 I travel around the U.S. all the time, and this is a loud and growing complaint that I hear from businesses, small to large, across virtually all industries.\n\n\u2022 Whether you were for or against \u201cObamacare,\u201d when massive changes to such an important part of the American economy are made, it does create uncertainty for many businesses.\n\n\u2022 The inability to face our fiscal reality is a concern. I believe that if we had adopted some form of the Simpson-Bowles plan to fix the debt, it would have been extremely beneficial to the economy.\n\n\u2022 Entitlement spending \u2013 which now is 60% of federal spending and is growing \u2013 is crowding out infrastructure spending and spending on initiatives like research and development and training.\n\n\u2022 In addition, uncertainty about the ultimate outcome of the Fed\u2019s unconventional QE policy (and our inability to deal with some fiscal issues) makes future Fed policy more complicated.\n\n\u2022 Political gridlock resulting not only in our government shutdown but in two debt ceiling crises was damaging and irresponsible.\n\n\u2022 U.S. corporate tax policy is hugely inefficient and, at the margin, drives American capital overseas.\n\n\u2022 U.S. immigration policy (which we should fix for moral reasons alone) also is driving brains and entrepreneurs overseas. Most economists think a good immigration policy could accelerate U.S. economic growth by 0.2% right away and by 2% over a 10-year period. This, alone, could create 3 million jobs.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "sailthru.author": "Linette Lopez", "application-name": "Business Insider", "twitter": {"description": "Jamie Dimon sees America, and it looks great except for a few...small... tweaks.", "creator": "lopezlinette", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/jamie-dimon-on-us-growth-2014-4", "image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5346c1a269bedd5230c62dbe-506-253/jamie-dimon-here-are-5-things-going-right-and-8-things-going-wrong-with-america.jpg", "title": "JAMIE DIMON: Here Are 5 Things Going Right And 8 Things Going Wrong With America", "site": "clusterstock", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.verticals": "clusterstock,moneygame", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "sailthru.tags": "Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan, Linette Lopez", "description": "Jamie Dimon sees America, and it looks great except for a few...small... tweaks.", "author": "Linette Lopez", "sailthru.date": "2014-04-10", "sailthru.title": "JAMIE DIMON: Here Are 5 Things Going Right And 8 Things Going Wrong With America", "theme-color": "#185f7c", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/5346c153eab8eae82088cdeb-50-50/jamie-dimon-here-are-5-things-going-right-and-8-things-going-wrong-with-america.jpg", "news_keywords": "Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan, Linette Lopez", "tbi-image": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5346c153eab8eae82088cdeb/jamie-dimon-here-are-5-things-going-right-and-8-things-going-wrong-with-america.jpg", "fb": {"app_id": 155043519637}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/assets/images/us/favicons/mstile-144x144.png?v=BI-US-2016-03-31", "date": "2014-04-10", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "author": "http://www.businessinsider.com/author/linette-lopez"}, "sailthru.description": "Jamie Dimon sees America, and it looks great except for a few...small... tweaks.", "viewport": "width=1024", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider", "description": "Jamie Dimon sees America, and it looks great except for a few...small... tweaks.", "title": "JAMIE DIMON: Here Are 5 Things Going Right And 8 Things Going Wrong With America", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com/jamie-dimon-on-us-growth-2014-4", "image": "http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/5346c1a269bedd5230c62dbe-1190-625/jamie-dimon-here-are-5-things-going-right-and-8-things-going-wrong-with-america.jpg", "type": "article"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider", "title": "JAMIE DIMON: Here Are 5 Things Going Right And 8 Things Going Wrong With America", "sailthru.image.full": "http://static1.businessinsider.com/image/5346c153eab8eae82088cdeb/jamie-dimon-here-are-5-things-going-right-and-8-things-going-wrong-with-america.jpg", "tbi-vertical": "clusterstock"}, "article_summary": "Dimon doesn't just use the blanket CEO \"uncertainty\" excuse for why growth is tepid, he prefers to get into the weeds.\nMost economists think a good immigration policy could accelerate U.S. economic growth by 0.2% right away and by 2% over a 10-year period.\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon's annual shareholder letter is out, and in it he has highlighted what he sees as the reasons why the United States is poised for greatness, and what's holding it back.\nNow for what's going right in the United States:\u2022 Consumers are in increasingly good financial shape.\n\u2022 Entitlement spending \u2013 which now is 60% of federal spending and is growing \u2013 is crowding out infrastructure spending and spending on initiatives like research and development and training."}
