Some are so small and in such remote places that they are barely noticed.\n\nConstant slipping above Slumgullion Pass, which is near Lake City in southwest Colorado, keeps the hillside moving about 6 inches a year. Some of the most visible are rockfalls on roadways, such as the huge slide south of Ouray that closed Red Mountain Pass for weeks this year and the one that shut down Loveland Pass last week.\n\n\u201cWe have a very dynamic topography. When you add water, it gets much more dynamic,\u201d said Tad Pfeffer, a geophysicist with the civil engineering department at the University of Colorado.\n\nHe points out that the lumpy, hummocky landscape in the foothills near Denver was created by past landslides. Experts, including Coe and Pfeffer, say there is little they can do to stop slides or to predict what will or won\u2019t slide. The forces percolating and loosening soil and rocks on cliffs and slopes are \u201csneaky,\u201d and geologists say they are causing constant slipping and sliding.\n\nThe resources devoted to researching them are slim. Landslides merit only a fraction of the funds devoted to earthquakes in Colorado, as well as nationally.\n\nThe Colorado Geological Survey has four landslide experts based at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden. The U.S. Geological Survey has eight landslide scientists based there. Nationally, the USGS has only a dozen landslide experts, including those in Colorado, working with an annual budget of just over $3 million to monitor slides across the country.\n\nIn comparison, earthquakes, which happen less frequently than landslides in Colorado, have about 40 USGS scientists dedicated to their study in a state that had nine deaths and more than $9 million in damages in the last heavy landslide year of 2010.\n\nLynn Highland of the USGS Landslide Information Center studied slides in Colorado for that year and advocated more tracking of slides and the losses they cause.\n\nCurrently, the only database of landslides in Colorado is a digitized map being created by the Colorado Geological Survey that shows where landslides have occurred. It doesn\u2019t contain related information that would help to show susceptibility for more slides.\n\nThat map shows slides as red patches sprinkled across the state, with the hot spots in the central mountains and the Interstate 70 corridor. In western Colorado, the slides are particularly dense around the Grand Mesa, where the recent landslide cut loose from what is believed to be the site of an ancient slide area.\n\nIn parts of Europe, there are landslide maps that go back to medieval times, but U.S. landslide experts don\u2019t have that kind of data. They also don\u2019t have the newest technologies that might help to paint a clearer picture of what is happening under Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nThere is monitoring equipment in place along the I-70 corridor, which cuts through some of the most active landslide areas in the state. And there are monitors in some of the most movable areas of the state, including Slumgullion Pass and the Chalk Cliffs near Buena Vista. Geologists were placing monitors in the Collbran slide late last week.\n\nThose monitors are so sensitive that they can detect movement by centimeters. Satellites trained on slides now can be used to watch for \u201ccreeping\u201d that might indicate a slide is getting ready to make another run.\n\nBut the gold standard for landslide-data gathering and behavior predicting is mostly out of the grasp of government slide experts.\n\nLight detection and ranging, or LiDAR, uses a pulsed-light laser beam to essentially X-ray Earth from an aerial vantage point. It can create an image of a slide area, minus the vegetation, that can show whether there are unknown fault lines or whether the area has slid previously.\n\nThat technology has been around since the early 1960s, when it was used to measure clouds. It later was used by astronauts to map the surface of the moon.\n\n\u201cIt would be enormously useful,\u201d said Jonathan Godt, director of the Colorado Geological Survey\u2019s Landslides Hazard Program.\n\nThe problem is that most of the LiDAR equipment is privately owned \u2014 and it is expensive to use. Godt estimated it might cost about $50,000 to use LiDAR on the Collbran-area slide. It is something that authorities are considering as they puzzle over what that massive slide might do next.\n\nSince early this year, they are able to put their heads together much easier to study such matters.\n\nThe state and national landslide experts are now all housed at the Colorado School of Mines. The Colorado Geological Survey recently made that move after the Colorado legislature cut it out of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources and placed it under the auspices of the School of Mines.\n\nThat means more collaboration is taking place when there is a disaster like last Sunday\u2019s 700-acre slide. Geologists with those agencies say it also will help leverage more resources to do more research and gather more data on Colorado\u2019s constantly shifting topography. But the likelihood of garnering more funding is slim.\n\nThe Colorado Department of Transportation currently does some of the most visible management of slides in the state, because there are more than 750 locations along roadways recognized as chronic hazards.\n\nUnder CDOT\u2019s Rockfall Program, a rating system is used to evaluate and prioritize locations for rockfall mitigation. CDOT is looking to expand that program to mudslides and landslides. Data gleaned from such a program could force changes in alignment of new roadways where rockfall and mudslides are more common.\n\nDaniel Miller, a geomorphologist for the nonprofit Earth Systems Institute, said the bottom line in a state such as Colorado is that nearly all mountainous areas, including those with major highways, could be shown to be landslide prone.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just been the way it is,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWhenever you have rocks up high, they are potentially going to fall down, but yet, the frequency in which landslides occur is so low that the actual risk that is posed is one that people are quite willing to accept.\u201d\n\nNancy Lofholm: 970-256-1957, nlofholm@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nlofholm\n\nStaff writers Monte Whaley and Zahira Torres contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Colorado landslides expected to be on rise in this wet year", "title": "Colorado landslides expected to be on rise in this wet year", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/05/31/colorado-landslides-expected-to-be-on-rise-in-this-wet-year/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140529__mudcombinedp1-1.jpg", "height": 480}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140529__mudcombinedp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-05-31T19:55:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T19:33:05+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd424\"", "article_summary": "Currently, the only database of landslides in Colorado is a digitized map being created by the Colorado Geological Survey that shows where landslides have occurred.\nThe Colorado Geological Survey has four landslide experts based at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden.\nThe Colorado Geological Survey recently made that move after the Colorado legislature cut it out of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources and placed it under the auspices of the School of Mines.\n\u201cIt would be enormously useful,\u201d said Jonathan Godt, director of the Colorado Geological Survey\u2019s Landslides Hazard Program.\n\u201cRight now, we are in a cycle of dangerous landslides,\u201d said Jeff Coe, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey."}
