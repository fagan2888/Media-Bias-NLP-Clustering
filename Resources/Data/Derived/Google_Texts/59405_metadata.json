He first asked for a lawyer only minutes into questioning after his arrest.\n\nDespite the request, police kept a public defender from meeting with Holmes on July 20. They also returned to interview Holmes on the afternoon of July 20 about the bombs, even though a lawyer the Holmes\u2019 family hired told a police detective that law enforcement was not permitted to speak with him. An attorney should have been present when Holmes was questioned, his defense argued.\n\nBut Samour ruled Thursday that allowing an attorney to be present could have endangered lives.\n\n\u201cOfficers could ill-afford to attempt to broker a compromise with an attorney acting on the defendant\u2019s behalf,\u201d Samour wrote.\n\nWithout information from Holmes, police concluded that the best option was to set off the bombs inside his apartment and allow them to burn the entire building down.\n\nHolmes\u2019 statements about the bombs to an Aurora detective and an FBI agent were made voluntarily and without coercion, Samour ruled.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Most of James Holmes\u2019 statements about apartment bombs OK\u2019d for trial", "title": "Most of James Holmes\u2019 statements about apartment bombs OK\u2019d for trial", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/01/09/most-of-james-holmes-statements-about-apartment-bombs-okd-for-trial/", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131017__apartment_holmes_jamesp1.jpg", "height": 399}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20131017__apartment_holmes_jamesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-09T15:50:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-28T07:43:41+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce34c\"", "article_summary": "Holmes\u2019 statements about the bombs to an Aurora detective and an FBI agent were made voluntarily and without coercion, Samour ruled.\nBut Samour ruled Thursday that allowing an attorney to be present could have endangered lives.\nWithout information from Holmes, police concluded that the best option was to set off the bombs inside his apartment and allow them to burn the entire building down.\nDespite the request, police kept a public defender from meeting with Holmes on July 20.\nIn a 126-page order issued Thursday, Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour ruled that police were justified in asking James Holmes about the explosives because the urgency of the situation required them to elicit information from Holmes in order to defuse the bombs safely."}
