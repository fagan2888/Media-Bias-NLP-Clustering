Must. Change.\u201d\n\nThe faces in the boisterous crowd were still overwhelmingly white, illustrating an impediment for the third-term U.S. senator as he emerges as the chief Democratic foil to Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn South Carolina, Georgia and other Southern states, African-Americans make up the bulk of the Democratic primary electorate. While Clinton and her husband have deep relationships with the black community, Sanders represents lily-white Vermont and has made headlines in clashes with Black Lives Matter activists.\n\nSanders\u2019 Friday and Saturday presidential debut in South Carolina, a key early primary state, provided a glimpse of a candidate adjusting as he seeks to prove strength beyond a white liberal base. Sanders\u2019 crowds were large for this stage of the campaign but still a little more than one-tenth the size of the throngs he drew to stadiums on the West Coast.\n\nSanders hired a young African-American woman, Symone Sanders, as his national press secretary, and she introduces him at rallies with a focus on the Voting Rights Act.\n\nBernie Sanders now devotes a 10-minute chunk of his stump speech to racial strife, voting rights and criminal justice reform. He scheduled private meetings with African-American ministers, activists and political leaders.\n\nAfter a rally in Greenville, Rosemary Wallace walked up to Symone Sanders to pledge her help. Wallace, who is black, lives in Rock Hill and helped organize for President Barack Obama in 2008. Her cannabis leaf earrings were an homage to her recent stint as a marijuana legalization activist in Colorado.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to reach into the churches and the barbershops,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go and talk to them there and let them know that Bernie Sanders is about helping you get Bookie or whoever out of jail for selling that dime bag down the street.\u201d\n\nThe Rev. Joseph Darby of Charleston, a longtime civil rights leader, said Sanders has a challenge on his hands.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s energized an interesting piece of the progressive wing of the party,\u201d Darby said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t know of any black folks who are vigorously supporting him right now.\u201d\n\n\u2018Something to whine about\u2019\n\nSanders\u2019 rise in polls nationally and in early-voting Iowa and New Hampshire comes at a perilous moment for Clinton, who is currently besieged by questions about her private email server. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is looking into whether Clinton\u2019s server improperly handled classified messages while she was secretary of state, though Clinton is reportedly not a target of the probe.\n\nMeanwhile, talk about a possible run by Vice President Joe Biden has accelerated as he meets with advisers and political leaders. Biden retains a strong following in South Carolina Democratic circles.\n\nThe Clinton campaign has tried to generate good news where it can. Last week, it rolled out an endorsement by former South Carolina Gov. Dick Riley, who was secretary of education under President Bill Clinton, even though his support had been widely reported for months.\n\nIt also debuted the endorsement of former Gov. Jim Hodges \u2014 who backed Obama in 2008. Campaign Chairman John Podesta and political strategist James Carville swept through South Carolina to rally supporters.\n\nAsked about the email server, Carville, who was a top operative behind Bill Clinton\u2019s campaigns, told a few dozen Democratic Party regulars at a breakfast in Columbia that it was no different from all the Republican-pursued scandals of the 1990s.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve just got to have something to do, something to whine about,\u201d Carville said.\n\nThe Clinton campaign started organizing in South Carolina as soon as she announced her candidacy in April. It has eight paid staff in Columbia and Charleston, along with 1,400 volunteers.\n\nBut the Sanders campaign is catching up. Chris Covert, Sanders\u2019 state director, said he is up to eight paid staff as well \u2014 with reinforcements to come in the fall \u2014 and more than 1,000 volunteers, with more on the way from sign-ups at Sanders\u2019 rallies.\n\nAttendees varied from skeptical to downright hostile toward Clinton.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of liberals that say, \u2018Oh I\u2019m for Hillary,\u2019 but they don\u2019t realize the Clintons are just as much of a superinvested reptile family that, like, the Bushes are,\u201d said Gil Semple, 23, of Columbia.\n\n\u2018Everything under the sun\u2019\n\nOn the stump, Sanders spends more than an hour hunched over a podium, flailing his arms, ticking off a liberal laundry list. He wants to expand Social Security and go to a single-payer \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d health care system. He wants to break up the big banks and make all public universities tuition-free.\n\n\u201cBernie promises everything under the sun,\u201d said Starr Wright, 55, of Athens, Ga., who made the trip to Greenville to see Sanders. \u201cDo we know we can\u2019t get it? Yeah.\u201d\n\nBut Wright and other Sanders fans described his appeal as that of a left-wing Donald Trump, a man whose \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d is about defying a corrupt system.\n\nIt is premised most of all on exorcising the influence of big money in politics. Sanders talks about his 400,000 donors giving an average of $31.20 apiece and how he has no unlimited-donation Super PAC.\n\nThe vision of a political process captured by billionaires extends to the \u201ccorporate media\u201d and the nation\u2019s \u201cgrotesque\u201d inequality.\n\n\u201cWhat does bother me \u2014 a lot \u2014 is when working-class people who struggle every day to make ends meet keep voting for people who make the rich richer and everybody else poorer,\u201d Sanders said in Sumter, straining to shout over the cheers. \u201cThat bothers me a lot!\u201d\n\nFor some Democrats, it\u2019s a question of heart vs. head.\n\nIn Columbia, Austin Jackson, 25, and Marcurius Byrd, 30, attended a sweaty Sanders rally on Friday night and a breakfast with Clinton-backing Carville on Saturday morning. Both remained undecided on who would make the best president.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll get stuff done,\u201d Byrd said of Clinton. \u201cBut she might go through an easier, backdoor way. \u2026\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders would probably go the harder route in dealing with something and be more honest about it \u2014 which is a lot less likely to happen, but you feel a hell of a lot better.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The 3,000-strong crowd hushed when Bernie Sanders described the horrific church massacre that happened a few miles away.", "author": "By Daniel Malloy - The Atlanta Journal-Constitution", "og": {"url": "http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/bernie-sanders-seeks-elusive-black-voters-in-south/nnPr4/", "image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/img/photos/2014/07/16/ab/11/MyAJC-OGImage200x200.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "The 3,000-strong crowd hushed when Bernie Sanders described the horrific church massacre that happened a few miles away.", "title": "Bernie Sanders seeks elusive black voters in South Carolina"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/resize/120x120/img/photos/2015/08/21/43/35/a494e39e333043c1b0deb6d57fc955af-13f248fa99194b049611738f25346f42-0.jpg", "description": "The 3,000-strong crowd hushed when Bernie Sanders described the horrific church massacre that happened a few miles away.", "card": "summary", "title": "Bernie Sanders seeks elusive black voters in South Carolina"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "myajc", "vr": {"canonical": "http://www.myajc.com/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/bernie-sanders-seeks-elusive-black-voters-in-south/nnPr4/"}, "cmg_revpath": "/re/292/3036711/news/news/state-regional-govt-politics/bernie-sanders-seeks-elusive-black-voters-in-south/nnPr4/", "keywords": "story-tpt-id:8340,state government,politics_ajc,politics,ajc-fedstategovt,facebook-politics-ajc", "viewport": "shrink-to-fit=no, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Biden retains a strong following in South Carolina Democratic circles.\nThe Clinton campaign started organizing in South Carolina as soon as she announced her candidacy in April.\nIn South Carolina, Georgia and other Southern states, African-Americans make up the bulk of the Democratic primary electorate.\nLast week, it rolled out an endorsement by former South Carolina Gov.\nSanders\u2019 Friday and Saturday presidential debut in South Carolina, a key early primary state, provided a glimpse of a candidate adjusting as he seeks to prove strength beyond a white liberal base."}
