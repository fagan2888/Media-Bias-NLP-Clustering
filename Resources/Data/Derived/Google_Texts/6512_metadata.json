Dorothy Zbornak. Well, actually, \u201cDorothy Zborknak.\u201d\n\nThis January, the \u201csatire\u201d site The Daily Currant ran an article claiming that a woman named \u201cDorothy Zborknak\u201d had become the first victim of these imaginary \u201cdeath panels.\u201d The story was then picked up in September by conservative site American News as actual fact:\n\nAccording to recent reports, a group of death panels organized under Obamacare ordered their first execution. Following a hearing by the president\u2019s Patient Resource Efficiency Board (PREB), 86-year-old Dorothy Zborknak has been ordered to death. The reason? According to the administration, she is no longer useful. Zborknak worked at Fleur de Lis Florist in Chicago for nearly forty years, before she made the decision to retire in 1998. Since that time, she has struggled with a host of health problems, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and kidney failure. \u201cUnfortunately, the cost of her care just became too expensive,\u201d claims Peter Johnston, a member of the Chicago PREB. \u201cUnder the Affordable Care Act, we have the power to make choices about end of life care and I stand by our ruling. I know it will be hard for the family to accept what\u2019s going to happen\u2026But from a financial standpoint, this was a very easy decision.\u201d What do you think? Is this just wrong?\n\nIt is wrong! Bea Arthur may have died of cancer in 2009, but Dorothy Zbornak is alive and well, living on in our hearts forever.\n\nAlthough the article dates back to September, the news of Ms. Zbornak\u2019s demise, they have been in heavy circulation on social media and through the chain emails (Of course chain emails. Of course.)\u2013possibly as a result of the recent elections and the fury over remarks made by Jonathan Gruber regarding Obamacare.\n\nThe rumor has reignited an interest in the idea of \u201cdeath panels,\u201d which may have inspired a recent Breitbart.com article hilariously titled \u201cThe Death Panels Are Coming.\u201d Which no, for the record, they are not. Because that is absurd. Almost as absurd as said death panels murdering Dorothy Zbornak. Or Dorothy Zborknak.\n\n[RightWingWatch]", "article_metadata": {"description": "An article from a satire news site has conservatives convinced Dorothy Zbornak was murdered by death panels.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Death and Taxes", "description": "Thank you for being the best conspiracy theory ever.", "title": "Conservatives think Dorothy Zbornak was murdered by death panels", "url": "http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/231227/conservatives-think-dorothy-zbornak-was-murdered-by-death-panels/", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://static.deathandtaxesmag.com/uploads/2014/11/Conservatives-think-Dorothy-Zbornak-was-murdered-by-death-panels-e1416006250204.jpg", "height": 400}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thank you for being the best conspiracy theory ever.", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 119986914707220}, "keywords": "death panels,dorothy zborknak,dorothy zbornak,politics", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-14T18:45:09Z", "modified_time": "2014-11-14T18:40:30Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb512\"", "article_summary": "Almost as absurd as said death panels murdering Dorothy Zbornak.\nDorothy Zbornak.\nBea Arthur may have died of cancer in 2009, but Dorothy Zbornak is alive and well, living on in our hearts forever.\nFollowing a hearing by the president\u2019s Patient Resource Efficiency Board (PREB), 86-year-old Dorothy Zborknak has been ordered to death.\nIn what has to be the absolute best conspiracy theory in history\u2013sorry Lizard People\u2013apparently, some conservatives are freaking out over the \u201cfirst victim of the death panels.\u201d That victim?"}
