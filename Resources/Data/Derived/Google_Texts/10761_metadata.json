But the U.S. Supreme Court is weighing a request that it take up the issue, raised by another caseand resolve the dispute once and force all.\n\nRead MoreYou better shop around: Medicare's open enrollment\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court could decide whether to take that second case by the end of October. But the insurers' plans will be in effect by January, months before the high court would be likely to rule. However, if the court did take the case, it could conceivably rule the subsidies were illegal during the same year the plans are in effect.\n\nThe language in the new contract due Wednesday recognizes the possibility of the Supreme Court invalidating the subsidies.\n\n\"CMS acknowledges that [a health plan issuer] has developed its products for [HealthCare.gov] based on the assumption that [subsidies for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses] will be available to qualifying Enrollees,\" the contract says. \"In the event that this assumption ceases to be valid during the term of this agreement, CMS acknowledges that Issuer could have cause to terminate this Agreement subject to applicable state and federal law.\"\n\nSeveral big health insurers asked about the language by CNBC, including Cigna, WellPoint and Independence Blue Cross, referred questions to the insurance industry trade group America's Health Insurance Plans.\n\nClare Krusing, an AHIP spokeswoman, said only, \"This provision just recognizes that health plans' exchange products are based on current assumptions relating to premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions.\"\n\nA CMS spokesman had no comment.\n\nDan Mendelson, CEO of the Avalere Health consultancy, said, \"My view is that the insurers participating in the exchange have to prepare for all eventualities. So it's not surprising that they have thought this through.\"\n\n\n\nMendelson added, however, that the \"chances that a drafting inconsistency brings the whole bill down are very small.\"\n\n\"I don't think anyone believes otherwise,\" he said.\n\nAnd the language of the clause suggests that insurance plans will have to continue providing coverage to their customers who signed up for 2015 under state and federal law.\n\nBut whether many of those customers would be able to afford that coverage without the subsidies remains a large open question.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "Language in contracts health insurers must sign to sell coverage on HealthCare.gov will let them terminate their plans if premium subsidies cease.", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, HealthCare.gov, Supreme Court, Halbig, health insurers", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Language in contracts health insurers must sign to sell coverage on HealthCare.gov will let them terminate their plans if premium subsidies cease.", "title": "New for 2015: Obamacare insurers' opt-out clause", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/10/22/obamacare-insurers-get-opt-out-clause-for-2015.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/06/24/101785774-479745177.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Language in contracts health insurers must sign to sell coverage on HealthCare.gov will let them terminate their plans if premium subsidies cease.", "creator": "@_DanMangan", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/10/22/obamacare-insurers-get-opt-out-clause-for-2015.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/06/24/101785774-479745177.1910x1000.jpg"}, "title": "New for 2015: Obamacare insurers' opt-out clause", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "keywords": "Health Insurance, Health Care, US: News, Politics, Obamacare, Cigna Corp, Anthem Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-10-22T13:49:51-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Health Insurance", "modified_time": "2014-10-22T13:51:26-0400", "tag": "Anthem Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 102107358, "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT"}, "article_summary": "But the insurers' plans will be in effect by January, months before the high court would be likely to rule.\nRead MoreYou better shop around: Medicare's open enrollmentThe Supreme Court could decide whether to take that second case by the end of October.\nSeveral big health insurers asked about the language by CNBC, including Cigna, WellPoint and Independence Blue Cross, referred questions to the insurance industry trade group America's Health Insurance Plans.\nAnd the language of the clause suggests that insurance plans will have to continue providing coverage to their customers who signed up for 2015 under state and federal law.\nBut the U.S. Supreme Court is weighing a request that it take up the issue, raised by another caseand resolve the dispute once and force all."}
