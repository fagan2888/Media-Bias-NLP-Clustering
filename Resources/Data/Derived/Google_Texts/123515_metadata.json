Strong beer. The occasional bad pop song. Hockey fights. Hockey hair. The Canadian tuxedo.\n\nStill, the U.S. pharmaceutical industry\u2019s concern about a law that let Maine residents buy prescription drugs from Canada is a little odd. There\u2019s no evidence that medicines from Canadian pharmacies pose any greater safety risk than those bought in the U.S. Yet industry trade groups have persuaded a judge to overturn the law, on the narrow grounds that drug importations are a federal matter.\n\nDrugmakers probably are more concerned with price than with safety. In Canada, drugs often cost much less than in the U.S. That\u2019s what made the Maine law popular.\n\nBut consider what makes Canadian drugs so much cheaper in the first place. Canadians are no better than Americans at mixing and packaging chemical compounds. The difference is they let government health-care plans use their purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices.\n\nIf that strikes you as socialized medicine, consider that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs does the same thing. Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor, does something similar, by demanding that drugmakers provide a rebate in exchange for participating in the program.\n\nBut those programs pale in size next to Medicare, which this year will spend an estimated $87 billion on prescription drugs. The 2003 law that created Medicare\u2019s Part D prescription drug benefit included a \u201cnoninterference clause,\u201d which specifically prevents the agency from negotiating lower prices.\n\nPartly this was a sop to drugmakers, and partly it was meant to ensure that beneficiaries would have access to all drugs, not just those whose producers met Medicare\u2019s terms. But Canada and the VA have shown that you don\u2019t need to cover every drug to give beneficiaries the options they need.\n\nJudging from the VA\u2019s experience \u2014 it pays an estimated 40 percent less than Medicare for the same types of drugs \u2014 repealing that clause could reduce costs for the elderly. The federal government could theoretically use the same negotiating power on behalf of the 11.5 million people enrolled in insurance plans through state Affordable Care Act exchanges, whose premiums are paid largely through federal subsidies. For that matter, it could create a Part D-type program open to every American \u2014 a public option for prescription drugs.\n\nCongress is unlikely to take any of those actions anytime soon. So, as an alternative, why not let American consumers take advantage of negotiated prices in Canada? The strategy has growing support: Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have introduced a bill to expand Maine\u2019s approach nationwide.\n\nThe senators point out that the U.S. spends about 40 percent more per person on pharmaceuticals than any other country. Buying drugs in Canada won\u2019t fix that. But until Congress can make it easier for the federal government to negotiate lower prices, it\u2019s a start.\n\nEditorial by Bloomberg View", "article_metadata": {"description": "The U.S. pharmaceutical industry's concern about a law that let Maine residents buy prescription drugs from Canada is a little odd.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Central Maine", "description": "The U.S. pharmaceutical industry's concern about a law that let Maine residents buy prescription drugs from Canada is a little odd.", "title": "Cheap Canadian drugs show U.S. failure to negotiate prices - Central Maine", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 362, "identifier": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CanadianDrugs.jpg", "height": 272}, "updated_time": "2015-03-13T16:09:45-04:00", "url": "http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/03/14/cheap-canadian-drugs-show-u-s-failure-to-negotiate-prices/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CanadianDrugs.jpg", "description": "The U.S. pharmaceutical industry's concern about a law that let Maine residents buy prescription drugs from Canada is a little odd.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cheap Canadian drugs show U.S. failure to negotiate prices - Central Maine"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=966680591", "fb": {"app_id": 754222714628811}, "article": {"section": "Editorials", "tag": "ouropinion", "published_time": "2015-03-14T04:15:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-03-13T16:09:45-04:00"}, "google-site-verification": "DT-FwcrUrXtAltcTNXUsA7tR4Ha0CLErawYbGlkpg94", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "For that matter, it could create a Part D-type program open to every American \u2014 a public option for prescription drugs.\nBut consider what makes Canadian drugs so much cheaper in the first place.\nBut those programs pale in size next to Medicare, which this year will spend an estimated $87 billion on prescription drugs.\nThe difference is they let government health-care plans use their purchasing power to negotiate lower drug prices.\nIn Canada, drugs often cost much less than in the U.S. That\u2019s what made the Maine law popular."}
