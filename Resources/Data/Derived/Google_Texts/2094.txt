Upon Senator Ted Cruz’s (R-TX) announcement that he’s running for the presidency, Morning Joe host Mika Brzezinski said that though she didn’t agree with a single thing Cruz believed, at least the GOP’s new crop of candidates was a vast improvement over the “clown car” of 2012.

Here occasional guest Donny Deutsch disagreed: “He’s Sarah Palin,” Deutsch argued Monday morning. “He’s theater. That’s what Sarah Palin was. We love the show, okay. But when it comes time for the grown-up voting…”

“Please don’t make me explain why he’s not Sarah Palin,” Brzezinski said. “I would get killed.”

“I’m not saying he’s not smarter,” Deutsch said. “I’m saying, where he exists in our conscience. By the way, would anybody like to make a bet that come November 16 he is not going to be part of the discussion? Is there any point to that? That’s all I’m saying: it’s that simple.”

When the history of 2016 is written, this segment will go in the index under “Lulz no.”
