In an experiment, researchers at the Mediterranean Center for Molecular Research in Nice, France were able to restore normal bone growth in mice modified to exhibit the dwarfism-causing condition achondroplasia. Although further trials are required, a human treatment could be available within three to five years.\n\n\u201cThis is a first, and although there are more steps we need to take before trials on humans, nothing so far has indicated it couldn\u2019t also work for people with dwarfism,\u201d said study author Elvire Gouze, speaking to The Local. \u201cThe treatment is so simple \u2013 it\u2019s just the injection of a protein, and the results show it really helped.\u201d\n\nPublished in the journal Science, the findings suggest that the introduction of a \u201cdecoy protein\u201d could effectively counteract the mutated protein that causes achondroplasia. By preventing binding with the mutant FGFR3 receptor, the decoy sFGFR3 allows normal bone growth to resume. In a mouse model experiment, subjects grew as large as their peers in as little as three weeks.\n\nGouze told reporters that since three weeks is roughly analogous to 15 human years, the treatment could be administered regularly from early childhood to puberty. This would restrict interference from the mutated protein, allowing children born with achondroplasia to reach their full height.\n\n\u201cWe have to do some further testing on mice, for example to see if the treatment can be delayed, or must be implemented right after birth, and then we have to test it on another animal, perhaps a non-human primate,\u201d said Gouze. \u201cBut all in all, we could be ready within three to five years to treat humans with this technique.\u201d\n\nThat said, the research team stressed that the treatment candidate should not be thought of as a \u201ccure\u201d for some \u201cdisease.\u201d Instead, the primary objective is to limit lumbar pain, spinal cord compression, and other debilitating conditions associated with dwarfism. Today, the only treatment option for such complications is surgery, The New York Times reported.\n\n\u201cRemember \u2013 the goal is not to eradicate dwarfism, or get rid of little people or anything like that,\u201d she added. \u201cIt didn\u2019t just help with height, but it also made a difference with all the other complications.\u201d\n\nSource: Postnatal Soluble FGFR3 Therapy Rescues Achondroplasia Symptoms and Restores Bone Growth in Mice.
