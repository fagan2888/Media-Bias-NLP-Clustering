As of last week, when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe concluded an unusually long state visit, we\u2019re on notice: This pact is probably in trouble.\n\nThe debate in Washington has two parts. As early as this week the Senate is scheduled to vote on a bill introduced last month that gives President Obama \u201cfast-track authority\u201d to sign a deal with other Pacific nations with a guarantee that Congress will not amend it to smithereens afterward.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Deals with Cuba, Iran, TPP Split Congress\n\nIf the fast track bill passes -- and Japan, New Zealand, and other, nations favoring the TPP accord have made this a precondition \u2013 lawmakers can say yes or no, nothing more. The fast-track legislation is expected to hit the House floor by the end of this month.\n\nPart 2 is the bill itself. And Capitol Hill\u2019s divisions on fast track, which cut across both parties, are mere prelude to the splits to come when TPP goes up for ratification. The administration wants this done and dusted by yearend so as to keep the issue out of the 2016 presidential race.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: However fractious the TPP debate gets in the U.S., its most formidable problems lie at the other end of the Pacific.\n\nThis is what Prime Minister Abe just told us, although you wouldn\u2019t know it from the news accounts. Resistance to the TPP among Asians and other Pacific nations is far more threatening, and with much greater political clout, than what we\u2019re in for on American shores.\n\nRelated: Japan, U.S. Sound Optimistic on TPP Trade Pact\n\nThe TPP\u2019s potential fates are many. In my read the two most likely as of now are (1) it simply won\u2019t fly other than in nations that don\u2019t (to be blunt) matter very much, or (2) it\u2019ll go through among the 11 other nations now onboard but won\u2019t mean a hell of a lot in practice.\n\nOrrin Hatch, the Republican from Utah and the Senate\u2019s generalissimo on the TPP question, gave a revealing interview to the Financial Times over the weekend. If Obama doesn\u2019t get more Democrats behind fast-track very, very quickly, Part 1 of this undertaking is instantly in doubt.\n\nAs Hatch explained, at the moment there are too many Tea Party defectors on the right side of the aisle and too few Democrats willing to vote the bill forward. He seemed to suggest that it would be easier for Obama to cajole Democrats to get behind fast track than it would be to budge the Tea Party resisters.\n\nThat\u2019s interesting by itself. Democrats are in for a rolling barrage of anti-TPP protest from constituencies\u2014labor, the greens, civil society groups, the progressive wing\u2014that matter at election time. If Democratic lawmakers are the best bet to push through fast track, the only word we\u2019ve got for this is, Whoa!\n\nRelated: Obama Says U.S., Japan Will Work to Lead TPP Talks to Success\n\nCongress and the administration do many things Americans voters don\u2019t want done. So let\u2019s jump to the larger point: Whatever TPP\u2019s fortunes in Washington, they\u2019re worse in Japan and elsewhere in Asia. It\u2019s time to get real about this.\n\nJean-Pierre Lehmann, a longtime Japan hand and an emeritus scholar at IMD, the business school in Lausanne, Switzerland, made a key point in a commentary published at The Globalist, the Washington web daily, as Abe\u2019s visit wound down. \u201cApart from Japan, Asian members of TPP are relatively minor: Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam. China is excluded,\u201d Lehmann wrote. \u201cThus, TPP is in essence a bilateral agreement that could consolidate the Tokyo-Washington Asia Pacific axis.\u201d\n\nA couple of problems right off. One, binding the U.S. and Japan on the economic side is a lot less than the TPP accord is supposed to do. Two, even that much is in serious doubt as of Abe\u2019s visit.\n\nRelated: Business Group Sees Thousands of U.S. Jobs from TPP\n\nThe Japanese leader couldn\u2019t even deliver on imports of autos and farm products during his talks with Obama last week. These were stale, intractable trade issues when I arrived in Tokyo as a correspondent in 1987. We haven\u2019t yet got even this stuff off the table?\n\nThe TPP\u2019s outlook in Japan is upside down from ours. U.S. corporations are thoroughly behind the pact\u2014having helped write many parts of it, after all. But big Japanese blue chips\u2014makers of cars, consumer electronics, and machinery\u2014are the core of the export sector and see nothing in the TPP other than unwelcome competition.\n\nFlip this over and you have the weak side of Japan: rice and produce farmers and underdeveloped industrial sectors such as drugs and financial services. Long the beneficiaries of protectionist regulation (and generous supporters of the governing Liberal Democrats), these constituencies are also against the TPP\u2014the farmers very vigorously.\n\nNow you can hear Abe\u2019s message to Obama for what it was: He\u2019s very unlikely to deliver on the TPP\u2014and whether he can\u2019t or doesn\u2019t want to is among the interesting questions he left behind last week. We\u2019ll have to see which it is.\n\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Free Trade Deal Puts Hillary on the Hot Seat\n\nLehmann notes political factors, too. Abe, a through-and-through nationalist, faces resistance from rightists who nurse a longtime fear of American domination. Over his left shoulder are the democratically minded. \u201cLike their counterparts in the U.S. and elsewhere,\u201d Lehmann observes, \u201cthey argue that the secretive nature of the TPP talks make them inherently anti-democratic.\u201d\n\nJapan\u2019s chronically weak economy does nothing for the mood in either of these constituencies.\n\nI see a more fundamental problem at work, and it mustn\u2019t be overlooked because it afflicts many of this nation\u2019s transactions abroad. This is the importance of culture, history, and the value many other societies bestow on what we can call in shorthand localism. You see this in spades throughout Asia.\n\nWhat we\u2019ve got in Washington and in corporate suites all over America\u2014and let\u2019s throw in Brussels\u2014are technocrats well trained in econometrics but dismissive (or uncomprehending) of these dimensions of social and political organization. No rational choice argument, however cogent on its own terms, will ever change this.\n\nFor a long time I judged that the Obama administration was blowing smoke as to the TPP\u2019s prospects. Now I think it comes down to narrow, unrounded thinking.\n\nMy take home, now that Abe\u2019s back in Tokyo: The TPP could well need a tombstone before this is over, and it\u2019ll read: One too-ambitious trade accord, stillborn, 2015.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership, until recently background noise for many Americans, is", "title": "The Abe-Obama Trans-Pacific Trade Deal Is in Trouble", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/05/04/Abe-Obama-Trans-Pacific-Trade-Deal-Trouble", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03112013_abe_japan_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2015/05/04/Abe-Obama-Trans-Pacific-Trade-Deal-Trouble", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/03112013_abe_japan_article.jpg", "creator": "@psmith7600", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The Trans-Pacific Partnership, until recently background noise for many Americans, is", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce76e\"", "article_summary": "Related: Japan, U.S. Sound Optimistic on TPP Trade PactThe TPP\u2019s potential fates are many.\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership, until recently background noise for many Americans, is about to become another field of battle in Washington.\nRelated: Obama\u2019s Free Trade Deal Puts Hillary on the Hot SeatLehmann notes political factors, too.\nSo let\u2019s jump to the larger point: Whatever TPP\u2019s fortunes in Washington, they\u2019re worse in Japan and elsewhere in Asia.\nAs of last week, when Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe concluded an unusually long state visit, we\u2019re on notice: This pact is probably in trouble."}
