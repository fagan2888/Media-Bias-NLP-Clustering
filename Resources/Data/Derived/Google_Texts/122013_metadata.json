Jindal says he\u2019ll vote for Trump\u2026 but he won\u2019t like it\n\nJindal called the war of words Tuesday heading into Indiana\u2019s primary between Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz \u201cdisgusting,\u201d and he said plenty of Republicans like himself are eager for other options.\n\nBut Jindal told CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin on Tuesday that Trump is likely to win Indiana and the party will have to grin and bear it.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s likely, this election, this nomination contest could be all but over by tonight. I think it\u2019s more and more likely that Donald Trump will be the nominee,\u201d Jindal said.\n\nAnd in a general election match-up with Hillary Clinton, Jindal said he\u2019d get behind Trump.\n\n\u201cI do think he\u2019ll be better than Hillary Clinton, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a great set of choices,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cIf he is the nominee, I\u2019m going to be supporting my party\u2019s nominee. I\u2019m not happy about it \u2026 but I would vote for him over Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nThe former presidential candidate said at least with Trump there\u2019s a chance he\u2019ll name a conservative to the Supreme Court or repeal Obamacare, and there is no shot with Clinton.\n\nJindal also tweaked Cruz for unloading on Trump. When the former governor was running for president, he was one of the first to deliver a harsh critique of the front-runner, while Cruz made an effort to praise the mogul.\n\n\u201cI was worried about the rise of the Donald Trump,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cI think it\u2019s ironic, Ted Cruz was one of the last people to continue to embrace him, to defend him, as recently as December \u2026 so I think it\u2019s ironic he\u2019s one of the last candidates to go now actually after Donald Trump now that he stands between him and the nomination.\u201d\n\nJindal did have some words of praise for Trump, saying that although he doesn\u2019t believe Trump is truly a conservative, he clearly is speaking to voters.\n\n\u201cI think Donald Trump has tapped into middle class anxieties.\u201d Jindal said. \u201cHe\u2019s doing well in part because voters are responding to what he is saying, he\u2019s saying, look, he\u2019ll fight for them.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Former Louisiana Gov.
