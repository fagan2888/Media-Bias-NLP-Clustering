On the exchange, the lowest state average is $119 a month \u2014 a 190 percent increase.\n\n\u2014 Today, a 27-year-old woman in Nashville can also buy a plan for as low as $58 a month. On the exchange, the lowest-priced plan in Nashville is $114 a month \u2014 a 97 percent increase. Even with a tax subsidy, that plan is $104 a month, almost twice what she could pay today.\n\n\u2014 Today, women in Nashville can choose from 30 insurance plans that cost less than the administration says insurance plans on the exchange will cost, even with the new tax subsidy.\n\n\u2014 In Nashville, 105 insurance plans offered today will not be available in the exchange.\n\nSaid the Republican senator, \u201cWhy should a 27-year-old male in Memphis be forced to pay nearly three times more than what he pays today for health insurance? Why should a young woman in Nashville have to pay twice as much? This isn't what President Obama promised Tennesseans, but it's what he's giving them \u2014 higher costs and less choice \u2014 that are two of the most urgent reasons Obamacare must be repealed and our health care system fixed.\"\n\nThe White House blog, however, focused on other states and details in its report.\n\n\u201cNearly all eligible uninsured Americans (about 95%) live in states with average premiums below earlier projections. And nearly all consumers (about 95%) will have a choice of health insurance companies, each of which offers a number of different plans,\u201d wrote Jeanne Lambrew, deputy assistant to the president for health policy.\n\nShe focused on Texas, not Tennessee: \u201cPremiums are even lower for workers and families qualifying for tax credits. For example, in Texas, an average 27-year-old with income of $25,000 could pay $83 for the lowest-cost bronze plan, $133 for the lowest-cost silver plan, and $145 per month for the second lowest-cost silver plan after tax credits. For a family of four in Texas with income of $50,000, they could pay $57 per month for the lowest bronze plan, $239 for the lowest silver plan, and $282 per month for the second lowest-cost silver plan.\u201d\n\nPaul Bedard, the Washington Examiner's \"Washington Secrets\" columnist, can be contacted at pbedard@washingtonexaminer.com.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The White House on Wednesday released a report on the costs of Obamacare for most Americans, heralding its interpretation that 95 percent of the nation will be able to buy health insurance premiums below \u201cearlier projections.\u201d\nBut note the words \u201cearlier projections.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean that the insurance Americans will have to buy, or be fined, under Obamacare will be cheaper than what they pay today, before Obamacare kicks in.\nWe know this because at the same time the White House was releasing its broad study, Tennessee Sen.
