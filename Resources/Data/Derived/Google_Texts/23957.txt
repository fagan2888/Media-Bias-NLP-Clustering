A naked man found floating in Lake Michigan was pulled from the water late Thursday night, officials said.

The 48-year-old man was rescued in the water off the 5600 block of North Lake Shore Drive, just north of Montrose Beach, at about 11:15 p.m., according to police and fire officials.

He was taken to Weiss Memorial Hospital and listed in serious condition.

“When he left, he did have a pulse,” Battalion Chief Thomas McCormack told reporters at the scene.
