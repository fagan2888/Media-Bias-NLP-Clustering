That\u2019s particularly true with this president. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s in this deal. We know we have trading partners who have violated agreements in trade deals, China being one of them. I think it\u2019s important to understand some of the fine print of this deal. for example, is China allowed to join this pacific trading agreement later on in a couple of years, yes or no? This is being sold as an opportunity for America to strengthen its lead and partnerships in the Asia Pacific region. I agree with that goal. On the other hand, if the truth is in these details China gets to join later, what are we doing here? I think the point is not free trade is bad. free trade is good for this nation. I think the point is, what exactly is in this agreement? This administration, unfortunately, has a track record of burying things in fine print, whether it\u2019s the Iran nuclear deal or Obamacare or maybe this agreement that turn out to be very different from their selling points.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "article_metadata": {"description": "Carly Fiorina: Reality Never Matches Obama's Selling Points", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Carly Fiorina: Reality Never Matches Obama's Selling Points", "title": "Carly Fiorina: Reality Never Matches Obama's Selling Points - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/carly-fiorina-flag-afp.jpg", "height": 480}, "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2015/05/10/carly-fiorina-reality-never-matches-obamas-selling-points/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Carly Fiorina: Reality Never Matches Obama's Selling Points", "creator": "@pamkeyNEN", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/04/carly-fiorina-flag-afp.jpg", "title": "Carly Fiorina: Reality Never Matches Obama's Selling Points - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Carly Fiorina, Fast Track Trade Authority,Breitbart TV,Carly Fiorina", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Fast Track Trade Authority", "published_time": "2015-05-10T08:33:50-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "for example, is China allowed to join this pacific trading agreement later on in a couple of years, yes or no?\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERSunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d former Hewlett Packard CEO and Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina said since President Barack Obama\u2019s selling points never match what is in the legislation he is pushing, she can not support giving him a fast track trade deal.\nWe know we have trading partners who have violated agreements in trade deals, China being one of them.\nThis is being sold as an opportunity for America to strengthen its lead and partnerships in the Asia Pacific region.\nOn the other hand, if the truth is in these details China gets to join later, what are we doing here?"}
