If we don\u2019t elect Ura Prolife-Sucker (R-Everwhere) then the Most Evil Democrat Ever will win and will immediately turn the US into hell on earth!\u201d (Recall that in 2008 Obama was going to inaugurate the End of Days by signing the Freedom of Choice Act the moment he was inaugurated\u2013and that FOCA instantly vanished the moment he was inaugurated).\n\nWell, the thing is, the Left has to play this game too with *their* base to stampede them to the voting booth. So every election year, PP and similar groups send out the panic-grams to the Faithful on the Left warning that this is the Most Important Election of our Time and only the faithful on the Left can stop the imminent destruction of our precious right to kill our children etc.\n\nRight wingers sometimes read that as \u201cWe\u2019ve got \u2019em on the run! We\u2019re winning! We\u2019re gonna overturn Roe!!!\u201d\n\nNo. We\u2019re not gonna overturn Roe. We\u2019re gonna see a maintenance of Roe as we have seen for 40 years because it is in the interest of both parties to do so. Both gin up their bases with hysteria about it, both get money and votes from it and both would be insane (politically speaking) to alter the status quo.\n\nWhy? 20% of Americans want abortion abolished, 20% want abortion on demand for any reason without apology and 60% don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t want to outlaw it, and don\u2019t want to think about it ever again. Both parties know that and exploit it for their mutual gain and benefit.\n\nIf you want to stop abortion, start thinking about how to change the culture, not overturn Roe, cuz that won\u2019t happen. My recommendation is to begin with getting serious about not punishing poor people for having children but instead helping them make a living wage so they can support their children.\n\nUnderstand: I\u2019d love to see Roe overturned. I\u2019d also like to see time travel and warp drive. But those won\u2019t happen either. Should we keep praying for that day to come? Of course. But until our actions match instead of contradicting our prayers, we won\u2019t see much change.\n\nOur present strategy, stretching back 35 years, has been to vote for the lesser of two evils on the theory that this would somehow end in something other than evil. Result: the prolife movement has arrived at its present predicament of enslavement to a party that uses the unborn as human shields while it pursues (surprise!) evil. And now we see the spectacle of Catholics who spend most of their energy making war on the Church\u2019s teaching when it comes to torture, the death penalty, unjust war, immigrants and a host of other issues in order to keep a \u201cplace at the table\u201d of the party that exploits them. The alleged \u201ccore issues\u201d are almost entirely ignored while the allege \u201cprudential judgments\u201d (gun zealotry, treating the poor like garbage, fighting the minimum wage, dogmatic opposition to any discussion of climate change) are plainly and obviously the *real* core non-negotiables.\n\nAnd so, at the end of 35 years of conditioning by Movement Conservatism, the only people who have moved have been anti-abortion-but-not-prolife conservative Christians who have reached the point where their subculture prefers a swine like Donald Trump to Pope Francis, who they routinely smear as a Communist, a Stalinist, \u201cChe Guevara\u2019s pope\u201d, a heretic and an enemy of the Faith.\n\nClearly, the Lesser of Two Evils strategy is an abject failure and needs to be discarded for a new approach.\n\nWhat approach? Uncompromisingly embrace the Church\u2019s *whole* teaching and be *more* prolife, not less. It\u2019s that simple. Stop whittling away at and watering down the teaching of the Church in order to trim the gospel to fit the many many many ways in which the GOP chooses death.\n\nWill we lose a place at the Table of our political kingmakers? Quite possibly. But then again, the apostles had no such place and they still conquered Rome.\n\nTrust in Go, not princes. Believe and live the *whole* gospel of life, not just the bits you like.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Catholic and Enjoying It!", "description": "Mark Shea's Blog: So That No Thought of Mine, No Matter How Stupid, Should Ever Go Unpublished Again!", "title": "Prolife people need to really understand something", "url": "http://www.patheos.com/blogs/markshea/2015/12/prolife-people-need-to-really-understand-something.html", "image": "http://media.patheos.com/Images/CathPT/CathPT_MarkShea_bio.jpg", "type": "article"}, "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages04.net,patheos.mkt5005.com,www.patheos.com", "robots": "noodp,noydir"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4661\"", "article_summary": "We\u2019re gonna overturn Roe!!\nWe\u2019re not gonna overturn Roe.\nIf you want to stop abortion, start thinking about how to change the culture, not overturn Roe, cuz that won\u2019t happen.\nResult: the prolife movement has arrived at its present predicament of enslavement to a party that uses the unborn as human shields while it pursues (surprise!)\nWell, the thing is, the Left has to play this game too with *their* base to stampede them to the voting booth."}
