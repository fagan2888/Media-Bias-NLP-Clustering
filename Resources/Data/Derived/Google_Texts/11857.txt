In a Sarasota architectural landmark going on 50 years old, residents and community members gathered Friday for their first look at a sweeping makeover of 10,000 square feet on its ground floor.

What had been a basement-like area dedicated to an exercise room, art studio and woodworking shop at Plymouth Harbor — a continuing-care retirement community between the mainland and St. Armands Key — is now a light-filled, state-of-the-art Wellness Center, to benefit residents and employees.

Designed and built with more than $1 million in donations from residents, family members and Plymouth Harbor's staff, it features a fitness room filled with new cardiovascular and strength-training equipment and a dance and exercise studio, where workouts come with soothing water views.

Chief among the many donors to the new center was resident Joanne Hastings, said Plymouth Harbor CEO Harry Hobson.

"Joanne was so fired up about this, and committed to making it happen," he said. "What a lady she was."

Shortly before Hastings passed away in December, at age 92, she took part in painting designs on a pegboard wall that was coming down to make way for the reconstruction. Her design and signature has been framed, Hobson said, and will hang in the new center.

The refurbished space, next to an existing indoor therapy pool, also contains an art studio, wood and hobby shops, a wellness consultation center — and a changing room with showers for Plymouth Harbor staff members, a mark of the residents' appreciation.

"We're very proud of this facility, and the entire community," said Hobson. "But at the end of the day, if you don't have the right staff, it doesn't work."
