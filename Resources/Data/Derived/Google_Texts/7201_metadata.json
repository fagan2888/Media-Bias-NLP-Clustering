His latest response about the Obama administration\u2019s guidance on respecting transgender students and patients suggests an incoherent desire to toe the Republican Party line while also staying true to his own seemingly more inclusive beliefs \u2014 to the extent those beliefs are even discernible.\n\nIn an interview with the Washington Post Monday, Trump said that if elected president, he would rescind these directives protecting transgender people. With Republicans leaders across the country overwhelmingly opposing the trans student protections in particular, this is no doubt what the Party wants to hear from their candidate.\n\nBut everything else Trump said in the interview sounded like he actually supports transgender people. He made the segue in a line denying that trans protections were a civil rights issue: \u201cI don\u2019t view it as civil rights or not civil rights. I think it\u2019s something where we have to help people \u2014 and hopefully the states will make the right decisions.\u201d\n\nThe Post summarizes that Trump \u201crepeatedly said transgender people should be protected under the law.\u201d He even seemed understanding of why it\u2019s become a big issue. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to protect all people, even though it\u2019s a tiny percentage of 1 percent. I think from that standpoint, [states] should come up with a policy that\u2019s going to work for everybody and protect people.\u201d\n\nThis represents Trump\u2019s second ping-pong on the issue in as many months. In April, he said on Today that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of problems\u201d with North Carolina\u2019s anti-LGBT HB2, which prohibits trans people from using the restrooms that match their gender identities in public buildings. \u201cPeople go; they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate. There has been so little trouble,\u201d he said. He even acknowledged that Caitlyn Jenner could enter Trump Tower and use whatever bathroom she felt most comfortable in \u2014 which she then did.\n\nBut his talking point since that interview is that this \u201cthis should be a states\u2019 issue.\u201d As he said on Good Morning America last week, \u201cI believe it should be states\u2019 rights and I think the states should make the decision, they\u2019re more capable of making the decision.\u201d\n\nWith Republican governors decrying that the guidance from the Department of Justice and Department of Education constitute \u201cfederal overreach,\u201d Trump might be trying to blow the dog whistle Republicans want to hear. He\u2019s been asked about trans issues pretty consistently for the past month, and yet he still claims ignorance about what\u2019s really at stake.\n\n\u201cI have not had any exposure to it at all,\u201d Trump told the Post, indicating he was unaware of having ever met or worked with a transgender person. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a very interesting subject to me. It\u2019s certainly an issue that\u2019s getting a lot of play and it\u2019s an issue that I\u2019m studying very closely.\u201d\n\nLike so many of Trump\u2019s positions, it\u2019s difficult to parse exactly what position he\u2019s taking, like last year when he said, \u201cI would end Obamacare and replace it with something terrific, for far less money for the country and for the people.\u201d He seems to agree with Democrats on what the outcome should be (trans protections), but he will cater to the Republican approach (state policies) to arrive at that outcome. In this case, Republicans have made it clear that not only do they oppose protections for the trans community, but they support policies like North Carolina\u2019s HB2 that enshrine discrimination into law. By appealing to both, it thus becomes apparent that Trump has no real position at all.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Donald Trump wants trans people to be protected, but he also wants to let Republican state leaders discriminate against them.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Donald Trump wants trans people to be protected, but he also wants to let Republican state leaders discriminate against them.", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Incoherent Position On Transgender Protections", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2016/05/17/3778859/donald-trump-transgender/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/17105905/Donald-Trump-600x315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump wants trans people to be protected, but he also wants to let Republican state leaders discriminate against them.", "creator": "@ZackFord", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/17105905/Donald-Trump-321x214.jpg", "title": "Donald Trump\u2019s Incoherent Position On Transgender Protections", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-lgbt", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/17105905/Donald-Trump-540x303.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/17105905/Donald-Trump-99x66.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-17T11:00:09+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/zackford"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "LGBT Donald Trump\u2019s Incoherent Position On Transgender Protections CREDIT: AP Photo/Mary AltafferAs the Republican Party struggles to embrace Donald Trump as its presidential nominee, it seems Donald Trump is also struggling to cater to what Republican leadership wants to hear from him.\nHe made the segue in a line denying that trans protections were a civil rights issue: \u201cI don\u2019t view it as civil rights or not civil rights.\nIn an interview with the Washington Post Monday, Trump said that if elected president, he would rescind these directives protecting transgender people.\nWith Republicans leaders across the country overwhelmingly opposing the trans student protections in particular, this is no doubt what the Party wants to hear from their candidate.\nBut everything else Trump said in the interview sounded like he actually supports transgender people."}
