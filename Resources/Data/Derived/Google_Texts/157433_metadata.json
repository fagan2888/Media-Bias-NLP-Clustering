Nor would you hear her thoughts on an activist investor that is urging the company to make big changes.\n\nThe line to see Ms. Mayer snaked up and down the stairs at the TimesCenter in New York. But instead of hearing her touch on any of those matters, they heard the familiar themes: she\u2019s bullish on native ads, Yahoo\u2019s digital magazines, mobile and Web video.\n\nBloomberg\n\nAgain and again, the ever-optimistic Ms. Mayer used the word \u201copportunity\u201dto describe the state of affairs at Yahoo. She was never asked what Yahoo might look to acquire with its Alibaba windfall, but said that Yahoo\u2019s investment in the Chinese Internet giant provided a big \u201copportunity.\u201d\n\nAnother word Ms. Mayer kept repeating during the interview was \u201cstorytelling,\u201d particularly as she espoused the value of native ads and video.\n\n\u201cI love native advertising,\u201d she said. \u201cI think of advertising as an art form.\u201d One of the things that has held back artful advertising on the Web, Ms. Mayer said, is \u201cthe fact that we have ads that don\u2019t necessarily match [our] content or fit into [our Web] experience.\u201d Sounds a lot like she is down on banners. Meanwhile, Ms. Mayer spoke enthusiastically about how, in her mind, consumers love advertising in magazines and on TV, something she\u2019d like to see happen more online.\n\n\u201cThe holy grail is when the ads are so good that they actually attract more users [to your sites],\u201d she said. \u201cFor us, display is really about brands storytelling, and display 2.0 is video.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "If you were hoping for clues about what [wsj-ticker ticker=\"YHOO\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\" name=\"Yahoo\" postfix=\"\"] Chief Executive [wsj-people name=\"Marissa Mayer\" displayName=\"Mayer, Marissa\" topicId=\"6954\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\"] is planning to do with all that post-", "title": "Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer Loves Native Ads and Video", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/10/02/yahoo-ceo-marissa-mayer-loves-native-ads-and-video/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BF-AI264_YAHOO_P_20140926171033.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer Loves Native Ads and Video", "description": "If you were hoping for clues about what [wsj-ticker ticker=\"YHOO\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\" name=\"Yahoo\" postfix=\"\"] Chief Executive [wsj-people name=\"Marissa Mayer\" displayName=\"Mayer, Marissa\" topicId=\"6954\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\"] is planning to do with all that post-", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Mike Shields", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CMO Today Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "CMO Today", "article.summary": "If you were hoping for clues about what [wsj-ticker ticker=\"YHOO\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\" name=\"Yahoo\" postfix=\"\"] Chief Executive [wsj-people name=\"Marissa Mayer\" displayName=\"Mayer, Marissa\" topicId=\"6954\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\"] is planning to do with all that post-", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-10-02T18:50:07-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/10/02/yahoo-ceo-marissa-mayer-loves-native-ads-and-video/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-269B-1702", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "CSuite", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "If you were hoping for clues about what [wsj-ticker ticker=\"YHOO\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\" name=\"Yahoo\" postfix=\"\"] Chief Executive [wsj-people name=\"Marissa Mayer\" displayName=\"Mayer, Marissa\" topicId=\"6954\" onlinesignificance=\"prominent\"] is planning to do with all that post-", "title": "Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer Loves Native Ads and Video", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/10/02/yahoo-ceo-marissa-mayer-loves-native-ads-and-video/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BF-AI264_YAHOO_P_20140926171033.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "CMO Today", "article.id": "BL-269B-1702", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-10-02T18:50:29-04:00"}, "article_summary": "The line to see Ms. Mayer snaked up and down the stairs at the TimesCenter in New York.\nBut instead of hearing her touch on any of those matters, they heard the familiar themes: she\u2019s bullish on native ads, Yahoo\u2019s digital magazines, mobile and Web video.\nBloombergAgain and again, the ever-optimistic Ms. Mayer used the word \u201copportunity\u201dto describe the state of affairs at Yahoo.\n\u201cI love native advertising,\u201d she said.\nMeanwhile, Ms. Mayer spoke enthusiastically about how, in her mind, consumers love advertising in magazines and on TV, something she\u2019d like to see happen more online."}
