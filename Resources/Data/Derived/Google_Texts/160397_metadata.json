Some 1.3 million of the problems involved citizenship, and an additional million involved income, the IG said.\n\nWorse, the IG found HHS was unable to resolve 2.6 million of these discrepancies because the ObamaCare \u201celigibility system was not fully operational.\u201d This means the government \u201ccannot ensure that an applicant meets each of the eligibility requirements for enrollment\u201d or that they\u2019re getting the right tax subsidies.\n\nHow huge are these numbers? Consider that only 6 million had filled out applications by the end of February and just 2.6 million had enrolled. And of the 300,000 problems the HHS was capable of resolving, it had managed to do so for only 10,000.\n\nMeanwhile, the 11 state-run exchanges had a total of 422,772 problems \u2014 equal to 34% of the applications they\u2019d received. These states didn\u2019t say how many of these had been resolved.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough, a separate IG report found the federal exchange and two state exchanges didn\u2019t have adequate internal controls to make sure they were protecting taxpayers from fraud and abuse.\n\nLooking at just 45 randomly selected applications, the analysis found cases where income data were wrong, Social Security numbers hadn\u2019t been checked, citizenship or legal status hadn\u2019t been verified and information was entered incorrectly.\n\nThe IG said that, as a result, the exchanges had limited ability \u201cto prevent the use of inaccurate or fraudulent information.\u201d\n\nOh, and the government apparently hasn\u2019t been properly reconciling its enrollment numbers with insurance companies to account for dropouts and cancellations \u2014 casting more doubt on enrollment numbers.\n\nIf ObamaCare were a private company, you can bet its executives would be facing criminal charges. Instead, Obama and the press are cheering ObamaCare as a great success.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Accountability: Two new audits reveal failures in ObamaCare on a scale even we didn't think possible, with unresolved discrepancies, rules violations and", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "Accountability: Two new audits reveal failures in ObamaCare on a scale even we didn\u2019t think possible, with unresolved discrepancies, rules violations and technology problems that expose taxpa\u2026", "title": "Government Audits Reveal Vast ObamaCare Failures", "url": "http://www.investors.com/politics/obamacare/government-audits-find-huge-obamacare-failures/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7.png", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@IBDInvestors"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.investors.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-ibd-favicon-v7-270x270.png", "date": "2014-07-01 15:55:00:-08:00", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-01T15:55:00+00:00", "modified_time": "-001-11-30T00:00:00+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Accountability: Two new audits reveal failures in ObamaCare on a scale even we didn\u2019t think possible, with unresolved discrepancies, rules violations and technology problems that expose taxpayers to massive overpayments.\nIn other words, the Social Security numbers, income, family size, citizenship or other information applicants provided didn\u2019t match existing government data.\nSome 1.3 million of the problems involved citizenship, and an additional million involved income, the IG said.\nIf ObamaCare were a private company, you can bet its executives would be facing criminal charges.\nConsider that only 6 million had filled out applications by the end of February and just 2.6 million had enrolled."}
