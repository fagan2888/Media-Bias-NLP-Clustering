He said the children at church responded positively to simple balloon animals, so he started watching online tutorials and attending balloon classes and conventions before attempting his own designs.\n\n\u201cI really enjoy the challenge of somebody saying, \u2018Make me my logo,\u2019 or something different,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you learn advanced twisting, the balloon becomes kind of like clay.\u201d\n\nCustom pieces he has done include a balloon version of Ariel from Disney\u2019s \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d a spider, a chain saw and a version of Lightning McQueen from Pixar\u2019s \u201cCars\u201d that is large enough for a young child to sit in, Bluvan said. He also is working on a dress made from weaving balloons like fabric, with balloon hooks to hold it together.\n\n\u201cI want to show people a professional and adult side of balloons,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd besides, balloons make everybody happy.\u201d\n\nMost balloon sculptures last about one week, though it depends on the types of balloons needed to make the design, Bluvan said. Latex-free options are available for some types of balloons.\n\nCost for on-site balloon twisting at events is $50 per hour for one twister or $85 per hour for two twisters. Centerpieces start at $10 and balloon archways start at $120. Prices vary for custom pieces.

Wanamaker and Huntoon has been delayed again and won\u2019t open until next year, according to a spokeswoman for its parent company.\n\nThe exterior of a hotel sits next to the Hampton Inn at 1515 S.W. Arrowhead Road, but little progress has been visible to the naked eye in recent months, and vegetation has grown several feet high on the lot around the hotel. It isn\u2019t clear whether more work has been done inside the building.\n\nArif Chaudry, who manages the Hampton Inn next door, said in January 2013 that the new hotel would be a Homewood Suites, which is an upscale extended-stay hotel chain owned by Hilton. He said at the time he thought the hotel would open in August or September.\n\nA spokeswoman for Homewood Suites said in May 2014 that the hotel would open in the last quarter of this year. Adriana Infante, another spokeswoman for the Hilton chains, said Thursday that construction is ongoing and the hotel will open next year.\n\n\u201cThe upcoming Homewood Suites by Hilton in Topeka is still under construction and is slated to open in the first quarter of 2015,\u201d she said.\n\nInfante said the opening date was pushed back because the hotel hasn\u2019t met construction deadlines.\n\nWhen the project was announced, Chaudry described the rooms as having one-bedroom and studio floor plans, with each room having a small kitchen.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "Business, News, Local, Local business", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "Jess Bluvan started learning to make balloon animals to keep kids amused at a church event, but the hobby has grown into a business.", "title": "Business Watch: Balloon artist opens new business", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/business/2014-08-02/business-watch-balloon-artist-opens-new-business", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/13581112.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "Jess Bluvan started learning to make balloon animals to keep kids amused at a church event, but the hobby has grown into a business.Bluvan and his wife, Darlene Bluvan, own Bumble Balloons, which offers custom-made balloon decorations and on-site balloon \u201ctwisting\u201d for events.
