PHOENIX — Arizona Senate Minority Leader Anna Tovar announced Thursday that she has dropped out of the running for both offices she was interested in pursuing for 2015.

Tovar, a Democrat, who represents the 19th District, was considering running for re-election and she had also formed an exploratory committee to run for Maricopa County Board of Supervisors in District 5.

“After speaking with my family and friends, I have decided that I will not be running for public office in this election cycle. With the support of my family, friends, and community, I have been honored to serve my district and state as an elected public servant.

“While it has been one of my greatest privileges, I feel that I must now take a new direction and focus on my family, maintaining my continued good health, and serving the community through some of the boards and organizations I am involved in,” Tovar said in a statement.

Tovar also tweeted out the decision, just as she did last month when she filed the paperwork to run for the County Board:

Tovar, who grew up in Tolleson, took office in 2013. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010, after serving on Tolleson’s city council.
