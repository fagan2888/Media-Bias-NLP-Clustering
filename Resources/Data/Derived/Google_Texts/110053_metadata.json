As our former congressman, Mike Pence spent countless hours on Fox news rallying against \u201cObamacare\u201d and voted over 40 times to repeal it. He even encouraged the Supreme Court to rule against its constitutionality. Despite countless hours of energy wasted and probably millions of taxpayer dollars squandered, it\u2019s still the law and has been implemented in over half the United States.\n\nThen, we have those hold out states who are ruled by the Republican Governors Association. They\u2019ve stood against Obamacare and the Federal expansion of health insurance as trying to cover more US citizens and control runaway health care costs. They even got the Supreme Court to rule in their favor so they could refuse Medicaid expansion \u2013 government-run insurance which strictly helps the most impoverished citizens in their states. It left over 9 million of the neediest Americans without health care insurance throughout 2013 and 2014. Politics over people.\n\nOne could say that Mike Pence\u2019s stance against Federal insurance expansion got him elected as Governor of our Hoosier state because of all the Tea Party fervor which took place within 2012 in Indiana. Giant swaths of uninformed Hoosiers who sit in front of Fox news gobbling up conservative propaganda couldn\u2019t wait to get their white-haired evangelical congressman into the governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nWell, Gov. Pence has stood strong against the Federal expansion of Medicaid up until yesterday. He sent his Hoosier Insurance Plan (HIP 2.0) proposal to the federal government asking for a waiver from Obama\u2019s administration, so he can still collect federal dollars to fund HIP 2.0 \u2013 a complete reversal of his stance as an anti-government Tea Partier. In fact, his $16.0 billion price tag for HIP 2.0 will need $14.5 billion in federal funds with the rest coming from a tobacco and hospital tax.\n\nGovernor Pence has taken his public relations campaign all around Indiana seeking feedback for HIP 2.0, and most everything we\u2019ve read in Hoosier newspapers has been positive \u2013 he\u2019s been praised from all the Gannett owned Indiana newspapers and even those not owned by Gannett. I\u2019m on the mailing list of Freedom Works, a conservative political advocacy group fronted by the billionaire Koch brothers, and they\u2019ve not said a word about Mike Pence\u2019s HIP 2.0.\n\nWhere are all the anti-government protestors? Has Governor Pence baffled them by altering the concept from \u201cgovernment-run\u201d insurance (Medicaid) to \u201cconsumer-driven\u201d insurance (HIP 2.0)?\n\nHere\u2019s a hint for our few conservative readers \u2013 you\u2019ve been duped again \u2013 he\u2019s putting lipstick on the pig, but it\u2019s still a pig.\n\nIf you look through the brilliantly displayed rainbow colors of smoke and creatively placed mirrors, you can still see a health insurance program funded 91% by the Federal government \u2013 Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion \u2013 \u201cthe most vile of entitlement programs for work eligible able-bodied men and women.\u201d\n\nAnd, not one single word by all the Billionaire funded think tanks, libertarians, Austrian-economic professors, free market societies across the land. Nary a word.\n\nThere is a short article in the Washington Times which states, \u201cThe expansion should be rejected,\u201d author Nina Owcharenko added. \u201cThe result of this waiver agreement will have a lasting effect \u2013 well beyond this governor\u2019s term in office \u2014 on the state of Indiana, Medicaid, and taxpayers.\u201d They were referring to an analysis completed by the Heritage Foundation. This package has been spun so well, once it unravels, it\u2019s going to hurt. Just like most republican programs. Remember, the trickle down economic theory of the late president Ronald Reagan? Thirty years later, we learned it trickled-up. #EpicFail.\n\nAs we wrote about in May, Governor Pence wrote a letter to then Governor Mitch Daniels back in 2012, telling him what his opinion of Obamacare and Medicaid expansion meant to Hoosiers and Americans \u2013 he wrote, \u201cIt is not merely a government takeover of health care, but, as the Supreme Court recently concluded, it is a massive tax increase on Hoosiers and small business owners.\u201d\n\nHowever, he\u2019s been touring the state promoting his plan supported by federal dollars, yet not a word by Gannett newspapers or their counterparts. Editorial opinions have all applauded his move to help the poorest Hoosiers. The same newspapers and media outlets who screamed the loudest at President Obama for expanding Medicaid into the states to cover our poorest Americans, are now applauding Pence for doing the same thing. They\u2019re opening up their editorial pages for Pence\u2019s public relation staff to sell Hoosiers on HIP 2.0. They\u2019ve even touted that Pence should now be taken seriously as a presidential candidate in 2016.\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer at HIP 2.0.\n\nIn order to make the hospital lobbyists happy, Pence agreed to make the effective start date January 1st, 2015, and increase the Medicaid payout ratio from 60 percent of Medicare to 75 percent, thus making it more attractive for healthcare providers, but passes those costs along to taxpayers.\n\nIt should be obvious why the hospitals backed Pence\u2019s plan \u2013 actually, they helped him underwrite it. They are also pushing for a start date of January 1, 2015 since they\u2019ve lost millions of dollars in revenues because of Pence\u2019s refusal to accept Medicaid expansion in 2014 leaving billions of federal dollars in Washington hurting regional hospitals across the state.\n\nHowever, from what we\u2019ve been told, the rush of a January 1st, 2015 roll-out has come at a high price for Pence\u2019s administration \u2013 the roll-out of HIP 2.0 (if approved) will be without his hand-picked health care leader, Family and Social Services Administration Secretary Debra Minott. She quit, but is not saying why. While she\u2019s refusing to comment publicly about her departure, a close source revealed, \u201cShe didn\u2019t believe the January 1, 2015 roll-out was possible.\u201d She had been noticeably absent from many of the meetings with hospital officials.\n\nAccording to many of the healthcare numbers floating around, increasing the capacity from 40-45,000 current HIP members to over 400,000 HIP 2.0 members will stretch the FSSA beyond its capacity. We\u2019re sure Ms. Minott knew it too, and saw how Kathleen Sebelius was treated last year when the pressure of ACA\u2019s roll-out caused computers to crash exposing a vulnerable technology system. She probably remembers the drilling Sebelius took from republicans and thought, \u201cThanks, but no thanks!\u201d\n\nMs Minott was a well-respected administrator with a leadership background. She was replaced by a Carmel psychiatrist. This should make Hoosiers and million dollar hospital executives very nervous \u2013 we\u2019ll see what happens.\n\nNo matter how much smoke and mirrors with dropping balloons and Gannett op/ed pages are printed, the fact remains \u2013 the anti-government Tea Partier has accepted Obamacare federal dollars \u2013 it\u2019s expanding an \u201centitlement\u201d and accepting federal tax dollars \u2013 the exact thing Pence has opposed for years, but nobody is calling him a hypocrite within Indiana. Not one newspaper has the testicular fortitude to call our governor out for what he is \u2013 a hypocrite who needed to rebundle Obamacare so it would make him look like an innovator.\n\nThe original HIP was funded by a cigarette tax, but there aren\u2019t enough smokers in the United States to fund his HIP 2.0. He hasn\u2019t innovated anything, except for a potentially more expensive program which Hoosiers will get stuck paying for long after he\u2019s gone to whatever political appointment will have him.\n\nThe fact our Gannett owned newspapers in this state refuse to properly inform Hoosiers is why we always end up holding the bag for these political schemes and nobody gets held accountable. The newspapers in this state just cover up the bone headed schemes because they were complicit by not informing their readers.\n\nBut, don\u2019t take it from us.
