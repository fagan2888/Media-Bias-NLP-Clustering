Did they move employees to less than 30 hours due to the full-time equivalent \u201c30-hour rule\u201d?\n\nWhat cost increases did they incur and how much did they pass along to employees?\n\nAre private exchanges gaining steam in the employer market?\n\nHow are plan designs changing to address high-cost specialty drugs such as Sovaldi for Hepatitis C?\n\nJay Greene: (313) 446-0325, jgreene@crain.com.
