KEYNES AND THE RESHAPING OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY\n\nBy Ed Conway\n\nPerseus Books, $27.95, 453 pages, illustrated\n\nThat great Victorian sage Thomas Carlyle, a master coiner of apt phrases, famously dubbed economics the dismal science, and there has been no shortage of people agreeing with him ever since. Fortunately for readers of this book about the conference held to determine postwar financial structure and the institutions necessary to regulate it, there is nothing dismal or dull or dreary about its author\u2019s account of what went on in those three summer weeks in 1944 in the foothills of New Hampshire\u2019s White Mountains. With no false modesty, he calls it \u201ca gripping tale,\u201d and he is right on target.\n\nMake no mistake about it, there is plenty of economics in these 400-plus pages. But Ed Conway, the economics editor of Britain\u2019s Sky News, is able to explain even the most arcane details clearly and accessibly without dumbing things down or condescending to the reader. He has a gift for making us understand \u2014 and even enjoy \u2014 such arcana as sterling balances, free convertibility of currencies, fixed versus floating exchange rates and a host of equally abstruse topics. A lively writer, he keeps the reader fully engaged from start to finish: everything you could wish for about Bretton Woods and its aftermath. Even the fact that there was no longer any such place by 1944; it had disappeared from the map \u201cmore than a century before the conference that made it famous.\u201d\n\nThat something on this scale could have been held at all only a few weeks after D-Day as Allied troops were still making their way through France and the war in the Pacific was still being fought far from the Japanese mainland is in itself remarkable. Indeed, both Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan were very much alive and kicking \u2014 to say nothing of killing \u2014 and both poured scorn on what was being established at Bretton Woods. It says a lot about the confidence of this nation\u2019s and its allies\u2019 leaders that they could focus on the postwar world while still profoundly engaged in the ongoing conflict.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty besides economics in \u201cThe Summit.\u201d The lavish ways at the hastily refurbished Mount Washington Hotel \u2014 chosen for its coolness over the heat and humidity of Washington \u2014 with its constantly free flowing liquor and rich dishes at mealtimes are memorably evoked, as are the astonished reactions to such sumptuousness from those delegates used to the Spartan regimes of shortages and rationing at home.\n\nThere was lots of golf, and dancing lessons claimed almost as many as the links. There were plenty of sexual high jinks between the male delegates \u2014 some quite high ranking \u2014 and the female secretarial staff, and Mr. Conway spotlights the sexism endemic in those days. The press corps had lots of softer stories to leaven their detailed reportage of the drier aspects of the proceedings, which certainly were not neglected: one enterprising reporter had as his personal tutor and source none other than Dean Acheson. There was also always plenty of good copy in Lady Keynes, better known as the Russian ballerina Lydia Lopokova, whose eccentricities of speech and deed were exceeded only by the fierceness of her relentless protectiveness and devotion toward her ailing husband.\n\nWhat was created at the conference was very much a reflection of the dominant position enjoyed by the United States militarily and economically, a determination to carry this paramount position into a Pax Americana with the U.S. dollar as its foundation and then some. Ultimately, Bretton Woods and its institutions only endured for little more than a quarter-century, but as Mr. Conway writes, \u201cthe system mapped out by the delegates during those three weeks in 1944 permitted the longest period of stability and economic growth in history. \u2026 There is no such thing as a perfect economic system; but, based on its performance, many economists still argue that Bretton Woods was as close as the global economy has ever come to it.\u201d\n\nThe ever-scrupulous Mr. Conway takes account of its critics and of alternate explanations for the stable prosperity of those years, but he makes a strong case for his conclusions. There can be no disputing his dictum that \u201cBretton Woods remains the only time countries ever came together to remold the world\u2019s monetary system. And for a tantalizing couple of decades it seemed to work.\u201d\n\nThere is, of course, no such thing as a perfect book, either, and some readers may feel that its author\u2019s nationality leads him to hail Lord Keynes as the meeting\u2019s dominant force, when Britain\u2019s economic weakness and American strength make that a stretch. Others may feel that he is overly sympathetic to the U.S. point man at Bretton Woods, the notorious Harry Dexter White, although he accepts White\u2019s espionage for the Soviet Union. But generally speaking, Mr. Conway is as sound in his judgments as his scope is wide and his analyses probing.\n\n\u2022 Martin Rubin is a writer and critic in Pasadena, Calif.", "article_metadata": {"description": "That great Victorian sage Thomas Carlyle, a master coiner of apt phrases, famously dubbed economics the dismal science, and there has been no shortage of people agreeing with him ever since.
