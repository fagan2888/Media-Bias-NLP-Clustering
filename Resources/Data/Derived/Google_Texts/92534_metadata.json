A partial list:\n\n\u2022 Atrocious security at the Office of Personnel Management permitted the Chinese to acquire personal data on more than 21 million federal workers, most of them applicants for security clearances. The theft of background investigation data has created a massive threat to U.S. national security that will last for decades and cost billions to mitigate.\n\nThe Chinese didn\u2019t even need to hack into OPM\u2019s poorly secured database to get the info, because some Chinese nationals help manage it.\n\n\u2022 The private email server Secretary of State Hillary Clinton used, possibly illegally, to conduct official business, probably was hacked by hostile foreign intelligence services, said former Deputy CIA Director Michael Morrell.\n\nSecrets from five U.S intelligence agencies were found in a random sample of just 40 of the roughly 33,000 emails Ms. Clinton turned over to the State Department, said inspectors general for the Intelligence Community and the State Department.\n\n\u201cIt is more likely than not that information classified higher than secret is present in this collection,\u201d the IGs said. One wonders what secrets may have been in the emails Ms. Clinton hasn\u2019t turned over.\n\n\u2022 One central task of the Department of Homeland Security is to secure our borders. DHS isn\u2019t doing it. Illegal immigrants comprise 3 percent of the population and, by some counts, 30 percent of the federal prison population. We spent $1.87 billion to incarcerate violent illegal immigrant felons last year, according to freelance researcher Jay Bates.\n\nLast year, DHS released into the general population 30,558 criminal aliens who among them had almost 80,000 convictions \u2014 including 250 homicides, 386 kidnappings, 373 sexual assaults, 994 aggravated assaults. Violent felons released by DHS in 2013 committed 1,000 additional crimes.\n\n\u2022 In security tests, the Transportation Security Administration missed 95 percent of bombs and weapons.\n\n\u2022 Dylann Roof was able to purchase the gun he used to murder nine people in a black church in Charleston, S.C., because the FBI failed to keep current the database of prohibited persons.\n\n\u2022 Dysfunction in the Secret Service is so great, \u201cit really is a miracle that [President Obama] hasn\u2019t been assassinated,\u201d wrote author Ron Kessler.\n\n\u2022 A year ago, the nation was scandalized by reports of secret waiting lists at Veterans Affairs hospitals and of senior managers falsifying records to collect bonuses. Since then, wait times have increased by 50 percent. A third of the vets on the waiting lists have died awaiting care. VA Secretary Robert McDonald falsely claimed that 60 employees were fired as a result of the scandals.\n\n\u2022 After eating up $2.2 billion, as of February, the Healthcare.gov website still wasn\u2019t providing insurance companies with accurate information. In a \u201csecret shopper test\u201d conducted by the Government Accountability Office, 90 percent of false applications were accepted. All but one of 23 Obamacare nonprofit co-ops lost money last year.\n\n\u2022 Amtrak has the worst safety record of any railroad and somehow manages to lose $6.65 each time it sells a $9.50 hamburger.\n\n\u2022 David Wright spent most of his time as director of the agency in the Department of Health and Human Services that monitors scientific misconduct and wrote in a scathing resignation letter in March of \u201cnavigating the remarkably dysfunctional HHS bureaucracy.\u201d Tasks that took a couple of days when he was a university administrator required weeks or months, he said. His bosses cared more about looking good than performing the agency\u2019s mission.\n\nThe greatest threat to America is government dysfunction, according to Robert Gates, Mr. Obama\u2019s first secretary of defense. Americans agree. For the president to say government \u201cworks better now than probably it ever has\u201d indicates he is delusional, dishonest or both. Which does much to explain why the government he heads is dysfunctional.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Government works better now than probably it ever has,\u201d President Barack Obama told the Daily Show\u2019s Jon Stewart last month.
