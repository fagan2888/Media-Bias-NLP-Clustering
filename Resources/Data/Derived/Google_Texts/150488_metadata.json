In fact, if you spell 'phone' as 'fone' now, it wouldn't be wrong anymore as it has also been added to the Dictionary.\n\nNot many are aware of the exact definition of commonly used words like 'Mamil,' which means a middle-aged man in Lycra, or 'silvertail,' which means a person who is socially prominent or who displays social aspirations. Now they form of the portal's lexicon.\n\nThe Guardian report says that the entries are made by editors at Oxford Dictionaries, who consider factors like the influence of popular culture, or the informal language that teenagers use, and also abbreviations such as WTAF (what the actual fuck), lolcat (a picture of a cat with a humorous caption), IDC (I don't care) and PMSL (pissing myself laughing).\n\n\"One of the benefits of our unique language monitoring program is that it enables us to track in detail how English language evolves over relatively short periods of time,\" said Oxford Dictionaries Editorial Director Judy Pearsall. \"For instance, in this age of the selfie perhaps it's no surprise that average monthly usage of the term duck face is 35 percent higher in 2014 than it was last year,\" Pearsall added, NPR reports.\n\nSome words that are frequently used in the gaming industry have also been added. They include respawn, which means a character in a video game that reappears after dying, and permadeath, meaning one who does not reappear.\n\nMostly those words that have been repeated maximum times on the Internet have made the cut.
