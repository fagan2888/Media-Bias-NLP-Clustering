Scott Baio had some harsh words for his friends in Hollywood who are planning on supporting Hillary Clinton for president and made the argument for why they should back Donald Trump. (RELATED: Scott Baio Claims His Starbucks Barista Refused To Say Donald Trump’s Name)

The actor told Greta Van Susteren on her Fox News show that it’s time celebrities embrace Trump, adding that he can’t understand why they would want to elect someone like Clinton who is going to take away all “their toys.”

“Hollywood votes the way Hollywood votes,” he said. “They are predominantly liberals. And I can’t understand why, because Hillary Clinton is basically a socialist, and if they want all of their toys taken away from them eventually, then you vote for her.”

“I think Donald Trump’s message is the guy doesn’t have to change anything because he doesn’t pander,” he added. “His message to me is just a very pro-American message. It’s about strong economy, strong military, building a wall, getting rid of Obamacare. All the things that this country needs to get right again.”

“I think she [Clinton] is a horrible candidate,” Baio continued. “I think she’s a bad human being. I think she’s crooked and corrupt. And I think a lot of people are finding that out, and they aren’t going to want to be involved with her.”

In March, the actor announced that he would be supporting Trump.
