After a few months of planning, the district now expects ethnic studies will cost $73 million to implement.\n\n\u201cA major portion of the latest $73 million estimate is needed for teaching staff,\u201d 89.3 KPCC reported in May.\n\nNEA wants the Los Angeles ethnic studies requirement to serve as a model nationwide, as the union spelled out July 5 during its annual meeting.\n\nLearn how to make Ethnic Studies a graduation requirement in every school: http://t.co/ktdpycefLU @JoseDelBarrio #NEARA15 \u2014 NEA (@NEAToday) July 5, 2015\n\nJose Lara, a California teacher, school board member and local NEA officer, received NEA\u2019s Social Justice Activist Award for promoting ethnic studies in Los Angeles Unified School District and throughout California.\n\nLAUSD has offered elective ethnic studies courses since the 1990s. Lara and activist group Ethnic Studies Now are supporting a California bill meant to follow the Los Angeles trajectory statewide.\n\nBefore the latest round of amendments, California Assembly Bill 101 would have required every school district in the state to offer an ethnic studies course.\n\nNEA failed to respond to questions about its Social Justice Activist Award, but ethnic studies has clearly been on the mind of union leadership for several years.\n\nIncluded in the Ethnic Studies Now \u201ctoolkit\u201d is an NEA paper from 2010 on \u201cThe Academic and Social Value of Ethnic Studies.\u201d\n\n\u201cRather than being divisive, ethnic studies helps students bridge differences that already exist in experiences and perspectives,\u201d NEA asserted in a summary of the paper\u2019s conclusions.\n\nA 2010 NEA \u201cstrategy guide\u201d for promoting ethnic studies focused on fighting an Arizona law to stop schools from teaching Mexican American studies and called for expanding ethnic studies elsewhere, as well.\n\nSupporters say ethnic studies increase class participation and reduce dropout rates among minority students. But regardless of the costs, what works in L.A. city schools may not translate nationwide.\n\n\u201cThe kinds of students we have vary greatly across the country \u2014 L.A. is certainly different than Cleveland, and Cleveland is certainly different than New York,\u201d Fabio Rojas, an associate professor of sociology at Indiana University, told Watchdog.org.\n\n\u201cWe would expect the content of the curriculum to be a little bit different across the country,\u201d he added.\n\nRojas said although there\u2019s \u201can element of truth\u201d to complaints that high school course materials \u201coverlook or under-emphasize the contributions of various ethnic minorities,\u201d that doesn\u2019t mean a semester-long ethnic studies course is a good idea in every district.\n\nIn some states and school districts, it may make more sense to use \u201cmore inclusive\u201d textbooks in traditional history and social studies classes, he said. Even when districts decide to offer standalone ethnic studies courses, they can often be taught by existing staff.\n\n\u201cIn high school, there are a lot of ways to do it,\u201d Rojas said. \u201cThere are a lot of options. You don\u2019t have to go and hire 1,000 new people; maybe people can be retrained, or you could rewrite the history books.\u201d\n\nNEA itself offers reasons for skepticism about whether Lara\u2019s vision of ethnic studies in every school would encourage racial unity or divisiveness.\n\nIn a heated speech at the same event where Lara received his Social Justice Activist Award, NEA executive director John Stocks fumed about \u201cwhite privilege,\u201d \u201cincome inequality\u201d and other politically charged concerns.\n\nLast year, the teachers union donated $15,000 to National Council of La Raza, a left-wing group demanding amnesty for illegal immigrants. NEA donated $50,000 each to illegal immigration advocacy groups Mi Familia Vota and National Immigration Law Center.\n\nFrom 2008-13, NEA gave $220,000 to MSNBC host and notorious race-hustler Al Sharpton\u2019s National Action Network.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new high school graduation requirement backed by the National Education Association could cost taxpayers billions.", "og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A new high school graduation requirement backed by the National Education Association could cost taxpayers billions.", "title": "Teachers union wants to make costly ethnic studies classes mandatory - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/07/jose-lara-nea-youtube-2015-07-05-300px.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-07-14T14:58:19+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/228189/union-ethnic-studies/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "A new high school graduation requirement backed by the National Education Association could cost taxpayers billions.", "title": "Teachers union wants to make costly ethnic studies classes mandatory - Watchdog.org", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2015/07/jose-lara-nea-youtube-2015-07-05-300px.jpg"}, "creator": "@jasonahart", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Education", "published_time": "2015-07-15T04:00:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-14T14:58:19+00:00"}, "news_keywords": "nea, teachers union, national education association, jose lara, LAUSD ethnic studies, los angeles ethnic studies, california ethnic studies, fabio rojas"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1107\"", "article_summary": "A 2010 NEA \u201cstrategy guide\u201d for promoting ethnic studies focused on fighting an Arizona law to stop schools from teaching Mexican American studies and called for expanding ethnic studies elsewhere, as well.\nAfter a few months of planning, the district now expects ethnic studies will cost $73 million to implement.\nNEA wants the Los Angeles ethnic studies requirement to serve as a model nationwide, as the union spelled out July 5 during its annual meeting.\nEven when districts decide to offer standalone ethnic studies courses, they can often be taught by existing staff.\nLara and activist group Ethnic Studies Now are supporting a California bill meant to follow the Los Angeles trajectory statewide."}
