Insects, the sight of blood, unemployment, germs?\n\nNope. Of the 89 potential fears the survey asked about, the one that the highest share of Americans said they were either \u201cafraid\u201d or \u201cvery afraid\u201d of was federal government corruption. It was also the only fear that a majority of Americans said they shared.\n\nFears shared by highest percentage of Americans Fear Percent Afraid or Very Afraid Corruption of Government Officials 58.0% Cyber-terrorism 44.8% Corporate Tracking of Personal Information 44.6% Terrorist Attacks 44.4% Government Tracking of Personal Information 41.4% Bio-Warfare 40.9% Identity Theft 39.6% Economic Collapse 39.2% Running of out Money in the Future 37.4% Credit Card Fraud 36.9%\n\nThis is \u2026 bizarre. But perhaps not completely surprising, given that other surveys have found upward trends in the shares of Americans who believe A) government corruption is widespread, and B) government is untrustworthy.\n\nEven so, these surveys have never asked about whether Americans were terrified of such apparently ubiquitous corruption.\n\nI was curious whether fears of government corruption varied much by political ideology, so I asked the researchers at Chapman to send me a breakdown of the data. It turns out that those who self-identify as conservative or extremely conservative are most likely to be afraid of government corruption. But a majority of every ideological group shares this fear, except (very narrowly) those who lean liberal.\n\n\n\nSource: Chapman University Survey of American Fears\n\nConservatives and extreme conservatives are also more likely than others to say they\u2019ve voted for a specific political party or candidate as a result of their fears.\n\n\n\nSource: Chapman University Survey of American Fears\n\nNote that this question referred to voting as a result of any fear at all, not necessarily fear of government corruption. That said, lots of other political/government-related terrors were close to the top of the survey\u2019s list of most widely held fears. These included government tracking of personal data (41.4 percent), gun control (36.5 percent) and Obamacare (35.7 percent).\n\nObamacare actually frightens a higher share of Americans than does becoming seriously ill or dying. Which seems ironic at first, and then when you think about it, makes complete sense. You\u2019d have to not fear illness or death to be really, truly terrified of Obamacare.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Perhaps not completely surprising, given that other surveys have found upward trends in the shares of Americans who believe government corruption is widespread and government is untrustworthy.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/crampell", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Perhaps not completely surprising, given that other surveys have found upward trends in the shares of Americans who believe government corruption is widespread and government is untrustworthy.", "title": "What\u2019s the scariest thing in America?
