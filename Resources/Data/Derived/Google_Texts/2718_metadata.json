Those are totally fair questions, especially for voters who don\u2019t get the same privilege of retail politics. There is plenty to say about Iowa\u2019s demographic makeup not being representative of the nation. There\u2019s no argument that is true.\n\nConsider that America is 17.4% Hispanic, 13.2% black and 5.4% Asian. Iowa is 5.6% Hispanic, 3.4% black and 2.2% Asian. (California, by contrast, is 38.6% Hispanic, 6.5% black and 14.4% Asian.)\n\nThere\u2019s also no argument that Iowans take the responsibility they\u2019ve only held for a few decades seriously, and they put the candidates through the paces. Each and every one of them.\n\nThat brings us to the difference between a primary and a caucus, which is basically a meeting. Democrats have a slightly different process, so your friends and neighbors are actually working to convince you to join their candidate.\n\nFlashback to an Iowa caucus 2008 Video by Christina Bellantoni Video by Christina Bellantoni See more videos\n\nGet a sense of what it\u2019s like with this video I shot at a caucus in 2008. This one, held in a church, gets good about 38 seconds in. The best quote was from the organizer counting off the groups caucusing for their candidates: \"Anyone for Christopher Dodd?\"\n\nThat night, without being plugged in, I was sure Hillary Clinton had won Iowa because she had performed so strongly in the caucus I observed. How is that possible? Well, a caucus is sort of complicated.\n\nTalking this over in the newsroom, we decided to try and simplify things. So we made a video with gummy bears.\n\nHow a caucus works, as explained with gummy bears The Iowa caucus kicks off on Monday. How does it work? Allow these gummy bears to explain. The Iowa caucus kicks off on Monday. How does it work? Allow these gummy bears to explain. See more videos\n\nMark Z. Barabak outlines how tonight\u2019s caucuses will work, and the long game of why it matters in the context of the party nomination which three tickets are punched out of Iowa.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps easiest to tell the story of Iowa through the voters themselves.\n\nLet\u2019s start with Gabe Searles, a lifelong Californian who moved to the Hawkeye State eight months after the last caucuses in 2012. He and his wife, Jaime, are getting a kick out of feeling like they matter. And being there to experience the caucus season has rekindled Gabe\u2019s interest in politics.\n\nThey took their three children on the road Saturday, starting with patriotic waffles, heading to a rally for Sen. Ted Cruz, snapping pics soon after with Sen. Marco Rubio and ending the day with Carly Fiorina. Sunday it was New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nThey already had seen Donald Trump, Ben Carson, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio with the Searles family Courtesy the Searles family Sen. Marco Rubio with the Searles family Sen. Marco Rubio with the Searles family (Courtesy the Searles family) (Courtesy the Searles family)\n\nThe Searles family got photos with most of the candidates, too.\n\n\"We figure we've got a unique opportunity being here in Iowa, and we wanted to take advantage of it,\" said Searles, a guitar teacher and graphic designer who grew up in San Jose.\n\nOr consider Charlie Comfort, an Iowa millennial who will be caucusing for Fiorina tonight. I\u2019ve been following him for years, and tracked his political journey for a story that went live this morning.\n\nIt was an action-packed weekend in the Hawkeye State, and our team was all over it on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nEvan Halper and Chris Megerian write that Sanders is trying to be Barack Obama, not Howard Dean.\n\nMegerian and Barabak also find the extremes of both parties are emblematic of deeply divided America.\n\nSeema Mehta examines Fiorina\u2019s roller-coaster candidacy, and finds she enters the Iowa caucuses much as she entered the race \u2014 an asterisk in the polls and a non-factor in a crowded field.\n\nKate Linthicum has our Iowa weather report, and four other things to watch for tonight.\n\nWe have five reporters and an editor on the ground in Iowa today. Meet our team and follow along tonight.\n\nWe\u2019ll also be tracking how people are viewing what\u2019s happening back in California. It starts in Sacramento, as freshman Assemblyman Matthew Harper (R-Huntington Beach) returns to work after spending his weekend in Iowa to help Cruz.\n\nAre you in Iowa? We want to hear from you.\n\nWe\u2019ll have live results on our politics page all evening. The caucuses begin at 5 p.m. Pacific time.\n\nDEMOCRATIC INFIGHTING\n\nWhen it comes to ousting Republicans in swing districts, you might think Democrats would all be on the same page. But that\u2019s not the case in a handful of races, as Javier Panzar reported Sunday.\n\nLocal activists feel national Democrats and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee are meddling in their affairs and pushing candidates who might demonstrate fundraising prowess but have less support at home.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Essential Politics: Tonight's the night, so here's a caucus explainer using gummy bears", "date": "2016-02-01", "Description": "I\u2019m your Essential Politics host\u00a0Christina Bellantoni, and I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m excited for the first-in-the-nation caucuses tonight in Iowa.
