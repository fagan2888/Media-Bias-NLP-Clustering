Rick Perry took the stage before thousands of Texans at the state Republican convention last week, it sounded a whole lot more like someone rehearsing a presidential stump speech than a politician ready to kiss the spotlight goodbye.\n\n\u201cThe national Democrats think Texas is the next battleground. Well let\u2019s be really clear: Texas will be their political burial ground,\u201d he said, bringing the crowd to its feet.\n\n[READ: Rick Perry Compares Homosexuality To Alcoholism]\n\nBut everything\u2019s big in Texas \u2013 including presidential ambitions \u2013 and Perry\u2019s not the only man in the state eyeing a White House bid in 2016. At the same convention, freshman Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was everywhere, speaking to women\u2019s groups, an anti-gay group and reporters. He delivered his own fiery speech with his signature opening line, \u201cI spent all week in Washington, D.C., and it is great to be back in America.\u201d\n\nCruz then spent hours shaking hands and signing autographs beside his exhibition booth, which may have aided his eventual victory in the convention's presidential straw poll. He topped the 14-person field with 43 percent of the vote. Even with a home state advantage, Perry came in fourth after Dr. Ben Carson of Maryland and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.\n\n\u201cIn Texas, Ted Cruz has effectively eclipsed Rick Perry,\u201d says Mark Jones, a political science professor at Rice University.\n\nIn the 2016 race for the White House, many wonder if the Lone Star State is big enough for the rising star and his more establishment rival?\n\nIdeologically, it\u2019s hard to draw many distinctions between Perry and Cruz: both are unabashedly conservative and rail against Obamacare, hitting the high notes in forums with social conservatives.\n\nBut Cruz and Perry represent a fault line within the GOP that reaches beyond the simple tea party versus establishment narrative. The difference between them comes down to governing. Cruz may run for president as the man willing to fight no matter the political costs, as exhibited by the 17-day federal government shutdown he inspired. Perry, on the other hand, is in a position to parachute into the race as the governor who isn\u2019t scared to put up a fight as long as he knows he can actually win the battle at hand.\n\n\u201cPerry has been a pitch perfect campaigner in Texas, but has also had to govern, and really to govern as a statewide elected official,\u201d says Cal Jillson, a political scientist based at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. \u201cCruz has never given a thought to governance.\u201d\n\nOn Perry\u2019s watch, Texas has soared to the top of the list as the country\u2019s fastest job creator. He\u2019s ticked off fellow governors by personally luring businesses to Texas by keeping corporate taxes low.\n\n[ALSO: U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz Renounces Canadian Citizenship]\n\nMeanwhile Cruz leans on his rhetoric and stirs up his base with big applause lines. After two years in Washington, he\u2019s managed to maintain his reputation as a lawmaker on the outside. There is no doubting that Cruz is the future of Texas, a state where anti-establishment candidates have found their stride.\n\n\u201cCruz has changed the game in Texas,\u201d says Matt Mackowiak, a Texas-based Republican strategist. \u201cHe wrote the playbook for a whole new generation of conservative candidates.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s victory in 2012 set the foundation this year. Tea party candidates have taken over nearly every statewide office in the state.\n\n\u201cIt seems the more experience you have, the longer you have been in the legislature, the longer you have been in Washington, the more suspect your views,\u201d says Jim McGrath, a Republican communications consultant in the state. \"Some of the shake-up is also ambition. We have had a pent-up demand for statewide office.\"\n\nCruz is the reason state Sen. Dan Patrick was able to clinch the nomination for lieutenant governor against incumbent David Dewhurst. He\u2019s the reason tea party-backed state Sen. Ken Paxton ran away with the Republican nomination for attorney general. And why Sid Miller won the nomination for agriculture commissioner against moderate Tommy Merritt. On the state level, even the Texas Senate has lost its moderate members laying the stage for an explosive 2015 legislative session that promises to be even more conservative than the state\u2019s seen in the past. If Texas was red in 2012, it\u2019s on its way to burgundy by 2016.\n\nNationally, though, the Republican Party is itching to go in a different direction. The establishment has been fighting back this primary season, something it may need to do again in 2016. Scarred from a bitter GOP 2012 presidential primary campaign that left their eventual nominee battered and bruised, national Republicans are likely to treasure experience above insurgency in 2016.\n\n\u201cAt a certain point even the voters who discount experience today will want to see leadership translated into policy,\u201d says Ray Sullivan, who served as Perry\u2019s spokesman in the 2012 presidential campaign. \u201cI am confident that the next presidential campaign that will be a central piece of the debate in the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Perry\u2019s got the resume, but he has yet to prove he can handle the challenges of a race. In a presidential contest that could to be crowded with sharp and seasoned governors, Perry has an uphill climb to distinguish himself. A series of flubs on the 2012 campaign trail made Perry a laughing stock. He forgot where he was at times on the stump and forgot what federal agencies he wanted to shed from the budget on the debate stage.\n\n\"I'm sure glad I had my boots on because I sure stepped in it out there,\" he told reporters after he failed to articulate that he would cut the Department of Energy, as well as Commerce and Education.\n\nPerry supporters argue the best candidates often after run more than once before they seal the nomination. It was true of Mitt Romney and Ronald Reagan. Last time, they say Perry got into the game too late and gave his staff inadequate time to prepare. As a result of a back surgery, they say he physically was struggling to keep up with the grueling pace of a campaign.\n\nNow Perry must rebuild his reputation nationwide. That\u2019s why he\u2019s been on the road. He\u2019s been to Iowa three times in six months. In South Carolina, the state where he both joined the presidential fray and dropped out in 2011, he\u2019s returned to shore up ties. He\u2019s not been to New Hampshire yet, but in May, he invited state leaders from the Granite State to join him in Texas on his turf. He has proved he\u2019s more articulate than he was before. This year alone, his black horn-rimmed glasses have made the rounds on Fox News, \u201cCrossfire\u201d and \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis strong performance in office in Texas and in the national media spotlight has led many Republicans to give him a strong second look,\u201d says Sullivan, his former flack. \u201cHe is more in command, confident and forceful than he has ever been. That is particularly important and impressive given where he was when the race ended in 2012.\u201d\n\nBut yet again, Cruz is clipping at his heels. The freshman senator has dropped by Iowa four times in eight months, addressed home schooling groups and pheasant hunted with some of the influential Republicans in the state. He\u2019s been to South Carolina and New Hampshire three times each, and been jet-setting to California and New York to attract high-rolling donors.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Decision 2016 [News]", "title": "Texas Might Not Be Big Enough for Ted Cruz and Rick Perry", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Ted Cruz could be the future of Texas, but Rick Perry may be better positioned for 2016.", "title": "A Tale of Two Texans in 2016: Perry And Cruz", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/06/13/texas-might-not-be-big-enough-for-ted-cruz-and-rick-perry", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/6d/de/c70342454047b4d0c63924cc79de/140612-cruzperry-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "<div>Ted Cruz could be the future of Texas, but Rick Perry may be better positioned for 2016.</div>", "site": "@USNews", "card": "summary", "title": "Texas Might Not Be Big Enough for Ted Cruz and Rick Perry"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "news", "date_published": "June 13, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Lauren Fox,Pulse,picks,2016 presidential election,Perry, Rick,Cruz, Ted,White House,Texas,Decision 2016 [News]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Ted Cruz could be the future of Texas, but Rick Perry may be better positioned for 2016."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccc6a\"", "article_summary": "At the same convention, freshman Texas Sen.
