The way is clear for President Obama to end his administration’s insistent disregard for the deeply held religious beliefs of the Little Sisters of the Poor and others who hold contraception to be immoral.

Obamacare regulations require health insurance to cover 20 pregnancy prevention measures, but the Sisters had excluded such coverage from the order’s pre-Obamacare plans.

The government came up with a so-called accommodation: The Sisters and others had only to file a paper stating religious objection — at which point the government would order the Sisters’ insurer to provide the coverage free of charge.

Mystifying the administration, the Sisters refused , saying they would be complicit in immorality by authorizing the government to force the insurer to deliver the exact anathema coverage.

So they Sisters faced Obama in the Supreme Court, which took a remarkable action after hearing the case: The justices asked the Sisters and the government whether the administration could provide coverage “in a way that does not require any involvement” by a religious organization.

Resisting all the way, the administration finally did admit, yes, it could accomplish that goal. Which is all the Sisters had sought, and which revealed the ideological ferocity behind Obama’s dismissal of First Amendment protections.

On Friday, Sister Loraine Maguire, the order’s mother provincial, wrote in the Wall Street Journal, “We have never asked the court to prevent the government or insurance companies from offering this coverage to women who want it.”

She added that “the government or an insurance company could provide a supplemental plan that covers these services” under a separate policy, such as through Medicaid or Obamacare health exchanges, that is truly independent.

The Sisters are asking Obama only to show respect for their faith, as the Supreme Court also appears to be doing. The President must do so.
