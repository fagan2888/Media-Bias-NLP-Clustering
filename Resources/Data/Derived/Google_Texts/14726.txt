Ted Cruz is still killing Jeb Bush and Rand Paul on Facebook

Ted Cruz, 2016’s King of Facebook?

According to Facebook’s latest numbers, Cruz has more than twice as many interactions–likes, posts, comments, and shares about him–as Jeb Bush.

Between April 17 and 23, ABC reports, Facebook saw 2.2 million interactions pertaining to Cruz, compared to 1 million for Jeb.

Rand Paul also trailed behind Cruz, with 1.8 million.

Marco Rubio and Scott Walker brought up the rear, at 1.3 million and 1.1 million respectively.

When Cruz and Paul first announced, Facebook released data showing that Cruz’s campaign announcement got almost three times as much interaction within the first 24 hours as Paul’s–5.7 million total interactions, versus Paul’s 1.9 million.

Cruz announced first, which gave him somewhat of a social media buzz edge over his rivals. He also tends to provide more fodder for liberals, making him the topic of conversation for all sides of the political divide.

Last week, for example, Cruz made waves by appearing at a reception hosted by two prominent gay hotel-owners, leading to a backlash from LGBT groups.
