Others asked whether the corporation meant \u201cnow expected\u201d or were setting themselves up to be proven wrong come Monday.\n\n\u201c@NJTRANSIT: Heavy delays not expected tmrw due to power issue, may be residual delays. You mean NOW expected? \u2014 James (@jasbbr) July 26, 2015\n\n@NJTRANSIT Hey who do I talk to about a refund for my July Monthly ticket? \u2014 Joey Pistone (@daguy666) July 26, 2015\n\nThe website says tickets and passes will be accepted by NJ Transit and private carrier buses, the PATH (at the 33rd Street, Hoboken Terminal and Newark Penn Station stops) and the New York Waterway at South Ferry in Hoboken \u201cto give customers maximum flexibility when planning their commute.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for NJ Transit, which pays Amtrak $100 million a year for upkeep of the Northeast Corridor, said after a series of service disruptions last week that they asked to know how the money was being spent.\n\nCommuters faced at least four service disruptions that caused delays\u2014all about a week after the NJ Transit board approved a $2.1 billion budget that would boost fares by 9 percent for rail customers to meet a $56 million shortfall.\n\nThe service disruptions prompted responses from Gov. Chris Christie and the NJ Department of Transportation. (NJ Transit took to its usually sparse Twitter feed to call out Amtrak and post updates.)\n\nChristie called on the Obama administration and Congress to address infrastructure problems, particularly with Amtrak, and asked the New Jersey Attorney General to review the service disruptions.\n\n\u201cNJ Transit commuters were victimized by nearly an entire week of extreme delays and cancellations for one reason only: Amtrak\u2019s indifference to New Jersey commuters and its abject neglect of the infrastructure that New Jersey and our entire region relies upon,\u201d he said.\n\nJamie Fox, transportation commissioner, sent a letter to Amtrak Friday asking to meet with representatives to \u201cdiscuss your corrective action plans,\u201d saying the state \u201ccannot afford further impairment of service to the Northeast Corridor and to NJ TRANSIT\u2019s customers.\u201d\n\nRobert M. Lavell, NJ Transit vice president and general operations manager, sent a letter formally expressing dissatisfaction with the service.\n\nSo far, the New Jersey Coast Line\u2019s trains appear to be running on time, according to njtransit.com and the Clever Commute app.\n\nSteph Solis: 732-643-4043; ssolis@gannettnj.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1S7byit", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "NJ Transit expects some \u2018residual delays\u2019 after an Amtrak power issue was reported Sunday", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "NJ Transit expects some \u2018residual delays\u2019 after an Amtrak power issue was reported Sunday", "title": "NJ Transit expects yet another day of delays", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/traffic/commuting/2015/07/27/nj-transit-tickets/30724751/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "NJ Transit expects some \u2018residual delays\u2019 after an Amtrak power issue was reported Sunday", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8223c4bd3b4bb15a66d404f93386207cec40c6fc/c=66-0-467-401&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/07/27/AsburyPark/B9318229846Z.1_20150727082446_000_G27BF8QMV.1-0.jpg", "title": "NJ Transit expects yet another day of delays", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/?_rdr"}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070", "news_keywords": "NJ TRANSIT, Amtrak, Chris Christie, Jamie Fox"}, "article_summary": "Buy Photo Anticipating another day of delays, NJ Transit said tickets and passes would be cross-honored at other locations.\nNJ Transit announced that tickets and passes would be cross-honored by various transit systems, according to the corporation's Twitter account.\nFirst, a tweet attributed expected delays to \u201cAmtrak power issues/repairs.\u201dThen, a subsequent tweet, noted that heavy delays were \u201cnot expected\u201d due to the power issue, but that commuters could see residual delays.\n(Photo: FILE PHOTO)Buy PhotoAnother onset of Amtrak power troubles threatens to disturb Monday travel for New Jersey Transit commuters.\n(NJ Transit took to its usually sparse Twitter feed to call out Amtrak and post updates.)"}
