It\u2019s dead. That local representatives can vote to toss 711,000 Washingtonians off health care, and get no political blowback for it, proves it.\n\nThis past week Congressman Dave Reichert voted to boot about 70,000 of his own constituents off health care. But he didn\u2019t get any flak about it.\n\nHis Washington, D.C., office wasn\u2019t flooded with calls. Nobody even bothered to tweet angrily at him.\n\nHis colleague, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Spokane, had it almost as easy. In the same party-line vote on Wednesday to repeal most of Obamacare, she voted to phase out newly acquired health coverage for about 81,300 of her Eastern Washington constituents.\n\nThat\u2019s a huge number of people \u2014 11.3 percent of all the people in her district. The reason there are more folks signed up for the various planks of Obamacare in her district east of the mountains is because the jobless rate is higher over there, and incomes lower.\n\nIn all, the bill to repeal Obamacare would have phased out the system of taxes and subsidies providing health insurance right now to 711,000 Washingtonians.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to overstate how unusual it is, historically speaking, for members of Congress to agree to cut off major benefits for that many of their own people, in one fell swoop. It\u2019s akin to voting to cut off all Medicare beneficiaries. (There are 1 million Washingtonians in that program.)\n\nBut even more unusual is that it doesn\u2019t seem to matter, politically. Reichert, R-Auburn, got no blowback at all and won\u2019t be challenged in his 8th District. The day after the vote, McMorris Rodgers held a Facebook chat and did get a few questions about the repeal. (\u201cHow can you in good conscience vote to take away health insurance for thousands of your constituents without showing everyone a replacement plan first?\u201d)\n\nShe provided a link to a website with some alternative ideas but no plans, and that was it.\n\nNow, the public probably realizes this is all Kabuki theater. Though Republicans\u2019 drive to cancel Obamacare finally reached the president\u2019s desk on Friday, he promptly vetoed it. So for now, nobody is being cut from anything.\n\nIt also could be that of McMorris Rodgers\u2019 5th District constituents, the 81,300 directly helped by Obama\u00adcare are not the most active voters. So her risk in voting to cut them off may be smaller than it appears.\n\nBut political scientists are starting to wonder if one of the old standby rules of politics might finally be breaking down. Namely, that all politics is local.\n\nIt used to be that no matter how big the arguments about cultural issues or wars or whatever national topic, politicians also took close care of their districts. The premise of \u201cconstituent service\u201d was that you\u2019re there in part to help your residents \u2014 even when it may go against your political stripes.\n\nNow extreme polarization may be trumping all that. In addition to not acknowledging that, say, 81,300 of your constituents are being helped by a law you\u2019re voting to repeal, some GOP members of Congress have stated they won\u2019t even assist people having any problems involving Obamacare.\n\n\u201cThe idea of not just neglecting but actively refusing constituent services, for reasons of ideology, would be unimaginable to the constituent-focused members of Congress of both parties elected beginning in the 1970s,\u201d wrote Mark Schmitt, a fellow at New America, a think tank in Washington, D.C., in an article last week about the phenomenon.\n\nIt\u2019s not that support for Obamacare equals compassion for your constituents. There are plenty of well-documented problems with the law that need to be fixed. But to vote to cut hundreds of thousands of state residents off health care without any plan for what to do instead is the kind of ideological action a politician might have once paid some price for back at home.\n\nBut politics has been \u201crecast as a winner-take-all conflict between wholly incompatible ideologies and identities,\u201d Schmitt wrote. The number of swing voters has shrunk dramatically. As a result, actual problems, difficulties and concerns of regular people are becoming irrelevant compared with tribal appeals to the far-right or far-left base.\n\nSo all politics isn\u2019t local anymore. All politics is ideological warfare.\n\nIf we elect a Republican president to go along with the Republican Congress, I wonder if they\u2019d really have the guts to throw this many people off health care. My bet would once have been no, they wouldn\u2019t. But the rules, they are a-changing.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Remember the old rule, all politics is local? It\u2019s dead.
