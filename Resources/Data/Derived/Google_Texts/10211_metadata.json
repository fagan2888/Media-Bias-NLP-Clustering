Among those surveyed, 17 percent admitted to using the restroom with the phone on mute during a conference call.\n\nNearly 70 percent of American employees work with a team that includes remote individuals, and nearly two-thirds participate in conference calls with colleagues. While such arrangements have many benefits, they can also lead to frustrations. A fifth of those surveyed said that it can be tough to keep everyone in the loop and communicate with everyone\n\nThe study found that workers spend an average of 11.8 hours per week preparing for and attending status meetings, including at least five minutes spent waiting for everyone to join the conference call.\n\nFiguring out how to keep a team focused during a remote conference call is becoming an important workplace skill, and may grow even more valuable in the future. More than 80 percent of American workers say they want to telecommute at least part time, and the typical American worker is only at his office desk about half the time according to GlobalWorkplaceAnalytics.com.\n\nAmong workers who are not self-employed, the ability to regularly work from home has more than doubled in the past decade, and 3.7 million employees now work from home at least half the time.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "More than three-quarters of Americans workers who participate in conference calls with", "title": "Here\u2019s a Big Problem With Working From Home", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/09/Here-s-Big-Problem-Working-Home", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02242014_Telecommuting_Working_From_Home.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/09/Here-s-Big-Problem-Working-Home", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/02242014_Telecommuting_Working_From_Home.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@bethbrav"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "More than three-quarters of Americans workers who participate in conference calls with", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "More than three-quarters of Americans workers who participate in conference calls with their colleagues admit to multi-tasking during the conversations.\nNearly 70 percent of American employees work with a team that includes remote individuals, and nearly two-thirds participate in conference calls with colleagues.\nFiguring out how to keep a team focused during a remote conference call is becoming an important workplace skill, and may grow even more valuable in the future.\nAmong those surveyed, 17 percent admitted to using the restroom with the phone on mute during a conference call.\nMore than 80 percent of American workers say they want to telecommute at least part time, and the typical American worker is only at his office desk about half the time according to GlobalWorkplaceAnalytics.com."}
