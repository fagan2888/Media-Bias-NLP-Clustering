But the iconic chocolate brownie, that perfect blend of cake and cookie, is banned in Vermont schools.\n\nIn its place are new hoped-for kid favorites such as fruit shish kabob, kale and even gluten-free paleo lemon bars.\n\nThe switch stems from nutrition mandates required under the new Smart-Snacks-in-Schools program in effect for public schools.\n\n\u201cThe new school lunch pattern has low fat, leaner proteins, greater variety and larger portions of fruits and vegetables; the grains have to be 100 percent whole-grain rich,\u201d Laurie Colgan, child nutrition program director at the Agency of Education, told Vermont Watchdog.\n\nThe new rules, which evolved out of the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, spell death to brownies, cupcakes, cookies and other bake sale goodies used to raise money for extracurriculars at money-strapped schools.\n\nDeborah Quackenbush, education division director at the Agency of Education, said Smart Snack standards apply to a la carte lunch items, vending machines and fundraising events between midnight and a half-hour after school.\n\nThe standard does not apply to off-campus events or to concessions for sporting events, plays and concerts. Moms who send brownies or cupcakes to celebrate a child\u2019s birthday in the new dessert-averse environment will be permitted to do so.\n\n\u201cThese changes are really supporting the types of diets that we as a country should be following to have a healthy diet and lifestyle,\u201d Colgan said.\n\nBut some states are beginning to revolt against the federal nutrition standards. In Massachusetts, an uprising over lost bake sale revenue led the state to repeal the standards for fundraisers. Two New York school districts abandoned the national school lunch program altogether after participation dropped precipitously. Other states are struggling with a \u201cplate waste\u201d epidemic estimated to cost more than $1 billion.\n\nRead More on Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The switch stems from nutrition mandates required under the new Smart-Snacks-in-Schools program in effect for public schools.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The switch stems from nutrition mandates required under the new Smart-Snacks-in-Schools program in effect for public schools.", "title": "Vermont Schools Ban Brownies, Replace Them With Kale", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140912_VTBrownieBan_Watchdog.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-09-13T13:35:28+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1AHsLko"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "The switch stems from nutrition mandates required under the new Smart-Snacks-in-Schools program in effect for public schools.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/140912_VTBrownieBan_Watchdog.jpg"}, "title": "Vermont Schools Ban Brownies, Replace Them With Kale", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12", "published_time": "2014-09-13T03:01:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-13T13:35:28+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Two New York school districts abandoned the national school lunch program altogether after participation dropped precipitously.\nBut the iconic chocolate brownie, that perfect blend of cake and cookie, is banned in Vermont schools.\nIn its place are new hoped-for kid favorites such as fruit shish kabob, kale and even gluten-free paleo lemon bars.\nBut some states are beginning to revolt against the federal nutrition standards.\nThe switch stems from nutrition mandates required under the new Smart-Snacks-in-Schools program in effect for public schools."}
