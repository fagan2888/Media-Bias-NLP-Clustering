There are plenty of dentists, they just aren\u2019t practicing in large numbers in rural and lower income areas.\n\nFlorida has an average of one dentist for every 1,874 residents. In Polk County, there is just one dentist for every 3,540 people.\n\nBrian Erickson is one of the many Polk County residents who put off dental care until his mouth pain became too much. \u201cI work and even through work, the coverage just isn\u2019t there,\u201d he explained. \u201cI was finally able to get covered through one of the programs at the Health Department, so I could get some fillings I\u2019ve been waiting years to do.\u201d\n\nSenior Dentist Stephen Ebner at the Florida Department of Health\u2018s Lakeland clinic says economics drive the shortage areas. \u201cIt\u2019s just market forces that create that discrepancy,\u201d said Ebner.\n\nLots of Polk County patients rely on Medicaid, Ebner said. It equals a low profit margin for dentists, which is a definite deterrent to new dental grads. \u201cThey have to go to an area where they\u2019re able to pay their loans off,\u201d Ebner explained.\n\nTo help fill the gap, some dentists are now regularly volunteering at places like Lakeland Volunteers in Medicine. Other organizations and select dental offices now offer annual free dental events, but the need is still huge. Erickson feels fortunate his mouth finally feels well enough to smile again. \u201cI had to wait so long just to express myself the way I wanted to express myself,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act requires health plans to cover dental services for children, but not adults. The American Dental Association reports a lack of dental coverage is such a problem right now, every 15-seconds someone goes to a hospital emergency room complaining of mouth pain.\n\nClick here for a list of places offering free or reduced dental services to Floridians.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Some communities across Florida have some of the most severe shortages of dentists in the entire country, according to the American Dental A\u2026", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "WFLA", "description": "Some communities across Florida have some of the most severe shortages of dentists in the entire country, according to the American Dental Association.
