Ms. Fari\u00f1a worked for more than 40 years in New York City public schools, earning a final salary of $218,906 when she retired in 2006 as a deputy chancellor. Her pay package was first reported by the New York Post.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio, who campaigned on message of reducing inequality throughout the city, said on Dec. 30 he would appoint Ms. Fari\u00f1a to lead the nation\u2019s largest school system.\n\n\u201cChancellor Fari\u00f1a is a lifelong educator who has given her career to the children of this city\u2013and she\u2019s come out of retirement at a time our schools need her,\u201d de Blasio spokesman Phil Walzak said in an email. \u201cWith her deep roots in our school system, managerial experience, and instructional expertise, she is qualified like no other candidate to lead our 1.1 million students into the future. She\u2019s earned her pension, and she\u2019s worth every dime of her salary.\u201d\n\nMs. Fari\u00f1a\u2019s base salary is the same as that of her predecessor, Dennis Walcott, who moved into the job after former Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s previous appointment, Cathie Black, resigned after three months. Mr. Walcott kept the salary he had previously been earning as a deputy mayor, rather than get a bump to the $250,000 the job had previously paid.\n\nA de Blasio administration official said Ms. Fari\u00f1a\u2019s base salary was less than the heads of smaller city school systems around country.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "The new New York City schools chancellor will earn both her pension and salary, putting her total pay at more than $400,000 a year.", "title": "New York Sets Schools Chancellor\u2019s Salary", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/01/05/new-york-sets-schools-chancellors-salary/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/img/WSJ_profile_lg.gif"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "New York Sets Schools Chancellor\u2019s Salary", "description": "The new New York City schools chancellor will earn both her pension and salary, putting her total pay at more than $400,000 a year.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Lisa Fleisher", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "The new New York City schools chancellor will earn both her pension and salary, putting her total pay at more than $400,000 a year.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-01-05T16:01:52-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/01/05/new-york-sets-schools-chancellors-salary/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-19511", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "The new New York City schools chancellor will earn both her pension and salary, putting her total pay at more than $400,000 a year.", "title": "New York Sets Schools Chancellor\u2019s Salary", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/01/05/new-york-sets-schools-chancellors-salary/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/blogs/img/WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-19511", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-01-05T16:12:09-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1b38\"", "article_summary": "The new New York City schools chancellor will earn both her pension and salary, putting her total pay at more than $400,000 a year, the de Blasio administration said.\nMs. Fari\u00f1a worked for more than 40 years in New York City public schools, earning a final salary of $218,906 when she retired in 2006 as a deputy chancellor.\nA de Blasio administration official said Ms. Fari\u00f1a\u2019s base salary was less than the heads of smaller city school systems around country.\nChancellor Carmen Fari\u00f1a will earn $212,614 a year in salary on top of her pension of about $200,000.\nMr. Walcott kept the salary he had previously been earning as a deputy mayor, rather than get a bump to the $250,000 the job had previously paid."}
