The surcharge, however, is not enumerated in the premium but is, instead, added to the total owed.\n\n\u201cIt must be a separate fee collected from each enrollee each month,\u201d Bracy continued. \u201cBut, nobody is doing that and they\u2019re not following the law.\u201d\n\nUltimately, the Bracy Family dismissed its lawsuit after Access Health CT added health plans to the exchange that would not require them to pay for abortions. His attorney, Alliance Defending Freedom\u2019s (ADF) Casey Mattox, said, \u201cAmericans should not have to pay a special fee for other people\u2019s abortions in order to take care of their own family\u2019s health.\u201d\n\nU.S. Rep. Chris Smith\u2019s (R-NJ) \u201cNo Taxpayer Funding of Abortion Act\u201d is intended to end this nontransparent entanglement of taxpayer funds with abortion.\n\nTorre further observes that while the CRomnibus continues traditional pro-life provisions, it fails to address the major conscience violation issue occurring in California.\n\nAs ADF reports on its website, in October it joined with Life Legal Defense Foundation (LLDF) to file a formalcomplaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regarding the state of California\u2019s move to force all employers, including churches, to pay for the elective abortions of others in their health insurance plans. Both ADF and LLDF allege that California\u2019s \u201ccoercion of abortion coverage violates federal law.\u201d\n\n\u201cForcing a church to be party to elective abortion is one of the utmost-imaginable assaults on our most fundamental American freedoms,\u201d said Mattox. \u201cCalifornia is flagrantly violating the federal law that protects employers from being forced into having abortion in their health insurance plans. No state can blatantly ignore federal law and think that it should continue to receive taxpayer money.\u201d\n\nAs Tony Perkins of Family Research Council wrote Wednesday, the CRomnibus failed to include the Abortion Non-Discrimination Act (ANDA), which would have given a course of action for those in California whose rights of conscience are being violated.\n\nPerkins states that while Republican leaders fell short on the inclusion of ANDA, the spending bill did include some \u201creporting language,\u201d meaning that HHS must respond to claims of conscience objectors to abortion \u2013 like those in California, and a warning to insurers about the requirement of transparency for their plans that cover abortion.\n\nANDA, however, is now included in the Health Care Conscience Rights Act, which was introduced last year by Rep. Diane Black (R-TN).", "article_metadata": {"description": "CRomnibus Gives $35 M to UN Population Fund, Continues Tax Subsidies For Abortions", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "CRomnibus Gives $35 M to UN Population Fund, Continues Tax Subsidies For Abortions", "title": "CRomnibus Gives $35 M to UN Population Fund, Continues Tax Subsidies For Abortions - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/12/11/Money.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/texas/2014/12/12/cromnibus-gives-35-m-to-un-population-fund-continues-tax-subsidies-for-abortions/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "CRomnibus Gives $35 M to UN Population Fund, Continues Tax Subsidies For Abortions", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-Texas/2014/12/11/Money.jpg", "title": "CRomnibus Gives $35 M to UN Population Fund, Continues Tax Subsidies For Abortions - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "China, Congress, Heritage,Breitbart Texas,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart Texas", "tag": "Heritage", "published_time": "2014-12-12T06:12:00-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart Texas"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9ff6\"", "article_summary": "\u201cCalifornia is flagrantly violating the federal law that protects employers from being forced into having abortion in their health insurance plans.\nTorre also notes that by continuing to fund Obamacare, the CRomnibus will still be allowing tax subsidies for elective abortions.\nTorre further observes that while the CRomnibus continues traditional pro-life provisions, it fails to address the major conscience violation issue occurring in California.\nA recent review of China\u2019s One-Child Policy by Dave Andrusko, editor at National Right to Life News, puts the funding in further perspective.\n\u201cBut, nobody is doing that and they\u2019re not following the law.\u201dUltimately, the Bracy Family dismissed its lawsuit after Access Health CT added health plans to the exchange that would not require them to pay for abortions."}
