He faces two counts of murder and one count of armed robbery.\n\nInvestigators say a surveillance camera shows Chandler pick up a few items Monday afternoon at Snappy's Mart in Palmetto, then walk to the counter and shoot both brothers in the head. Authorities say Chandler took cash and cigarettes.\n\nPolice identified the victims as 23-year-old Khasem Yousef and 17-year-old Faares Yousef.\n\nChandler was released from prison in September 2011 after serving less than two years on a three-year sentence for attempted armed robbery with a weapon. Records show he's on probation.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "Federal agents have arrested a man wanted for killing two brothers as they worked at their family's convenience store in Florida.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://health.wusf.usf.edu/post/man-charged-shooting-deaths-brothers-fl-store", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/healthnewsfl/files/styles/medium/public/201509/marshals.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Federal agents have arrested a man wanted for killing two brothers as they worked at their family's convenience store in Florida.", "title": "Man Charged In Shooting Deaths Of Brothers In FL Store"}, "story_id": 439137355, "twitter": {"site": "@HealthNewsFL", "card": "summary", "creator": "@HealthNewsFL"}, "author": "Associated Press", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Man Charged In Shooting Deaths Of Brothers In FL Store"}, "nid": 11912, "datePublished": "2015-09-10", "keywords": "shooting deaths, murder, armed robbery", "wordCount": 151, "has_audio": 0, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "article_summary": "Federal agents have arrested a man wanted for killing two brothers as they worked at their family's convenience store in Florida.\nAuthorities say Chandler took cash and cigarettes.\nThe Bradenton Herald reports that 25-year-old Devin Chandler was arrested Tuesday by U.S. marshals in Tampa.\nChandler was released from prison in September 2011 after serving less than two years on a three-year sentence for attempted armed robbery with a weapon.\nPolice identified the victims as 23-year-old Khasem Yousef and 17-year-old Faares Yousef."}
