Three Republicans kicked off presidential campaigns, a record, I\u2019ll bet. Adding to the excitement, New York state Senate president Dean Skelos got indicted for extortion just three months after New York House Speaker Sheldon Silver got indicted for the very same thing. Skelos is the fifth Senate leader in four years to be nailed for corruption. I bet that\u2019s a record too.\n\nAs the 2016 presidential race heats up, the Republican field continues to mystify and alarm. We can now safely say this batch is crazier than the last. On Monday, Ben Carson kicked things off with a gospel choir singing a chorus of Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself. \u201d One assumes Carson read the original lyrics, which include this gem: This world is mine for the taking. Make me king, as we move toward a new world order. Yikes.\n\nCarson\u2019s mind is, to rob from Tom Stoppard, a cabinet of vulgar curios. He calls Obamacare \u201cThe worst thing that has happened\u2026 since slavery\u201d and says America is \u201cvery much like Nazi Germany.\u201d Save for a biographical bit about his mom, his speech was a long rant against \u201celites,\u201d \u201csocialists,\u201d \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d \u201cthought police\u201d and the national debt. Even listening closely one couldn\u2019t tell if he was just exploiting the paranoia of his audience or had actually succumbed to it himself.\n\nOn Tuesday, Carly Fiorina and Mike Huckabee joined the fray. Fiorina announced in a one-minute video that opened with shots of \u2014 and at \u2014 Hillary Clinton. Listening to her one got a sense of what Sarah Palin would sound like had she gone to Stanford, as when she said the Founders didn\u2019t want a permanent political class when in fact they were all members of one. She vows to run government like a business, by which we assume she means one other than Hewlett Packard. She\u2019s clearly in the running for the award for most pointless campaign, unless of course Trump gets in.\n\nHuckabee threw the biggest shindig, a shrewd move for a guy looking to seem like a bigger threat than he is. When he came on the scene in \u201908 he struck me as a nice man with whom I happened to disagree. But there\u2019s nothing quite like the pursuit of a GOP presidential nod to corrode a man\u2019s character. His execrable campaign book, \u201cGods, Guns, Grits and Gravy,\u201d picked raw every cultural scab on the body politic he could reach. More interestingly, he\u2019s running as an economic populist of the Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan school. He could conceivably reassemble his Iowa evangelical base, marshal Buchanan\u2019s old New Hampshire crowd and surprise us all. But he\u2019s probably developed too much of the wrong kind of transparency to pull off such a delicate trick.\n\nIn New Jersey, Chris Christie made news by not getting indicted. You can do that in New Jersey, make news by not getting indicted. Three people close to him were indicted this week over Bridgegate, though, and one pled guilty. Christie called it a\u201d\u2018vindication\u201d and fled to New Hampshire where he said, without apparent irony, that people were making too much of Tom Brady deflating all those footballs.\n\nOn the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton had another really good/bad week. On the plus side she went to Nevada, where sitting behind what looked like the children\u2019s table at a public library, she made some crisp points on immigration that in regard to parents of \u201cDreamers\u201d went farther than Obama\u2019s executive orders go. It was her second major policy speech, coming just a week after one in which she endorsed sentencing reform and pinning cameras on cops.\n\nIt was a welcome surprise, but not what many reporters made of it. In an article headlined \u201cHillary Clinton Shows New Willingness to Tackle Risky Issues,\u201d the New York Times\u2019 Patrick Healy wrote that \u201c\u2026barreling ahead with her agenda\u201d a Hillary \u201cunafraid to court controversy on an issue dear to her\u201d had shown \u201ca new willingness to take stands that turn off some voters or interest groups.\u201d If only.\n\nThe problem is that none of Clinton\u2019s positions are in the least bit bold. She got out ahead of Obama on immigration, but only on his executive order, not his policy. The immigration positions she took are standard Democratic fare and public support for them hovers around 60 percent. Sentencing reform is the first bipartisan idea in ages to show any legs. Support for cop cameras polls at about 70 percent. Hillary has now made news by supposedly breaking with Barack on immigration and Bill on crime. I\u2019ll pay attention when she breaks with both on the economy.\n\nClinton\u2019s bad week took the form of Bill Clinton saying he\u2019ll go right on raking in half-million dollar speaking fees because, after earning upward of $125 million since leaving office, \u201cI gotta pay the bills.\u201d The Times piece further commended Hillary for her \u201cbullish decision\u201d to \u201ccourt donors\u201d for a super PAC, but that was bad too. Our campaign finance laws are a sickening sham, but we still have a few left on the books. One states that a declared candidate can\u2019t raise money for an \u201cindependent\u201d super PAC. Hillary\u2019s \u201cbullish decision\u201d is to attend the PAC\u2019s fundraisers, but leave just before the pitch. This is a problem.\n\nOnly one candidate had a really good week. In his first day in the race, Bernie Sanders raised $1.5 million, more than any Republican did on day one. Better yet, it came from 35,000 donors in amounts averaging $43. Best of all, by early this week 175,000 volunteers had signed on to help.\n\nLater in the week an Iowa Q poll showed Sanders polling 15 percent, putting him four points ahead of Vice President Biden and 12 points ahead of every other Clinton challenger. Democrats know Clinton as well as you can know a politician. Forty percent of them want another candidate. Taken together, these numbers say Sanders may clear out the second tier early. If he does, he\u2019ll frame an extraordinary debate and bring with him to the convention a mighty force of delegates, the first in a generation to care about what\u2019s in the Democratic platform.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Progressives can either declare war on corruption and secrecy, or risk electing a right-wing populist demagogue", "title": "Chris Christie and our GOP corruption nightmare: Fight, or this is how Ben Carson and Huckabee catch fire", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Progressives can either declare war on corruption and secrecy, or risk electing a right-wing populist demagogue", "title": "Chris Christie and our GOP corruption nightmare: Fight, or this is how Ben Carson and Huckabee catch fire", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/10/chris_christie_and_our_gop_corruption_nightmare_fight_or_this_is_how_ben_carson_and_huckabee_catch_fire/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/chris_christie_illo2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Progressives can either declare war on corruption and secrecy, or risk electing a right-wing populist demagogue", "title": "Chris Christie and our GOP corruption nightmare: Fight, or this is how Ben Carson and Huckabee catch fire", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/chris_christie_illo2.jpg", "creator": "@BillCurryct", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Bill Curry", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Ben Carson, Bernie Sanders, Carly Fiorina, Chris Christie, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Hillary Clinton, Mike Huckabee", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Topics: Ben Carson, Bernie Sanders, Carly Fiorina, Chris Christie, Editor's Picks, Elections 2016, Hillary Clinton, Mike Huckabee, Politics NewsIf you like politics, it was one heck of a week.\nFiorina announced in a one-minute video that opened with shots of \u2014 and at \u2014 Hillary Clinton.\nOn Monday, Ben Carson kicked things off with a gospel choir singing a chorus of Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself.\nOn the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton had another really good/bad week.\nLater in the week an Iowa Q poll showed Sanders polling 15 percent, putting him four points ahead of Vice President Biden and 12 points ahead of every other Clinton challenger."}
