CAIRO (AP) — Egypt’s President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi told The Associated Press on Saturday he is prepared to give whatever support is needed in the fight against the Islamic State group but called for a “comprehensive strategy” to tackle the roots of extremism across the region.

In his first interview with a foreign media outlet since taking office in June, el-Sissi sought to present himself and Egypt as at the vanguard of confronting militancy, citing it as the reason for his ouster of Egypt’s first freely elected president more than a year ago — a move that brought international criticism and strained ties with top ally the United States.

He told AP that Egyptians had realized the danger of “political Islam” and that if he had not acted, the Arab world’s most populous nation would have faced “civil war” and bloodshed now seen in Iraq and Syria.

“I warned about the great danger a year ago,” he said. “But it was not clear (to others) until the events in Iraq and the Islamic State’s sweep” over much of that country.

El-Sissi did not elaborate on what support Egypt might give to the U.S.-led coalition aimed at fighting the extremist group. When asked if Egypt might provide airspace access or logistical support for airstrikes, he said, “We are completely committed to giving support. We will do whatever is required.”

But he appeared to rule out sending troops, saying Iraq’s military is strong enough to fight the militants and “it’s not a matter of ground troops from abroad.”
