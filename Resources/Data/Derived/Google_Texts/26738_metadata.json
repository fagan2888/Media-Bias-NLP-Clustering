His perspective was unique when the world revolved around him, as it does for nearly all young people. And it\u2019s no less interesting since circumstances awoke him to the realization that the world is best when shared.\n\nHis story has been one of redemption. Anybody out there believe 18 months ago the Broncos would have been better off getting rid of him? A portion of the fan base did. Countless angry e-mails and tweets are proof.\n\n\u201cSometimes, you get one shot,\u201d Miller said last week. \u201cYou blew it, you\u2019re done. I made some mistakes, but I have a second chance to get all of that back. You know that story, \u2018All Dogs Go To Heaven\u2019? He\u2019s living crazy, he died, he said, \u2018Man, if I can go back, I\u2019ll be better.\u2019 It\u2019s kind of like that. I got another opportunity, and I want to take full advantage of that.\u201d\n\nBeautiful, Von. It remains possible for a young man to maintain innocence in one sense and mature in others. A pass-rushing outside linebacker with 30 sacks and two Pro Bowl appearances in his first two seasons, Miller\u2019s third year was a nightmare. He was suspended the first six games last season for what the NFL determined was an aggravated violation of its banned substance policy, then was sidelined the final four games, including the Broncos\u2019 two AFC playoff victories and Super Bowl loss, after suffering a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee.\n\nBroncos Mailbag: Pose a question for Mike Klis\n\nThe Broncos showed faith, not only sticking with Miller this season but picking up a contract option that will pay him $9.754 million in 2015.\n\nIn turn, Miller proved he was far from a lost cause. He never missed a game this season and had 14 sacks, the sixth-highest total in the league. He was better against the run this season and less vulnerable in pass coverage.\n\nAnd he\u2019s not finished. The Broncos play a divisional-round playoff game next Sunday at home.\n\n\u201cSome of what he went through was self-imposed,\u201d said Broncos defensive tackle Terrance Knighton. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s redemption. I think it\u2019s more so a road to maturity.\u201d\n\nInitially, Miller deflected the suggestion that he has been a feel-good comeback story. A story of redemption that warms the heart of the most callous Broncos fan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never looked at it like that,\u201d Miller said. \u201cI\u2019ve never looked at this as a short-term deal. When I came back from my suspension, I said I can\u2019t promise anything right now. Over time I can get all that trust back. It\u2019s only been a year. I\u2019ve still got a long way to go. You have struggles every day, but I feel like I\u2019m better with those. I\u2019m at a point in my life where I\u2019m living the dream again.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been more of the serious Miller since his suspension ordeal. The unwanted attention steeled him, thickened his skin, stitched his joyful soul with a lining of caution.\n\nBut the kid didn\u2019t disappear. \u201cAll Dogs Go To Heaven\u201d is an animated film that was hardly a blockbuster at the box office in 1989, the year Miller was born, only to later set records in DVD sales, as kids such as Miller aged into young adults.\n\nAnd by all accounts, he is growing up.\n\n\u201cVon\u2019s on time. He doesn\u2019t miss anything. No off-the-field issues,\u201d Knighton said. \u201cHe\u2019s focused. I think he understands that with the ability he\u2019s been given, he has a responsibility to be a leader and do things the right way. He\u2019s seen other guys in the league step their games up. Guys like J.J. Watt and Justin Houston get 20 sacks. I\u2019m pretty sure that motivates him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t be outdone by a cornerback\u201d\n\nKnighton must know Miller pretty well. Considering the limitations Miller had with his knee, he had a very good season. Through 13 games, he had 13 sacks.\n\nConsidering the type of player Miller wants to become, the regular season left him desiring more. Houston and Watt each had six sacks in their final three games to finish with 22 and 20\u00bd, respectively. Miller had one sack in his final three games and wound up with 14.\n\nAsked to critique his season, Miller said: \u201cIt was all right. I\u2019m not all the way back. I\u2019m playing at an elite level, I feel, but my whole purpose was doing something that hasn\u2019t been done before. I haven\u2019t done that, yet. Next year I\u2019ll be completely healthy. I gauge my right leg off my left leg. It\u2019s not exactly like my left leg, yet. Getting that back to 100 percent next year, I think I\u2019ll be better.\u201d\n\nChris Harris was the Broncos\u2019 recipient of the Ed Block Courage Award this season because of his own comeback from ACL surgery. But it could have gone to Miller, whose knee damage was more severe.\n\nOr the honor could have gone to defensive lineman Derek Wolfe, who overcame strokelike symptoms, or safety Rahim Moore, who overcame a life-threatening circulation disorder in his leg.\n\nCome again how the Broncos\u2019 defense reached the Super Bowl last year? Among that group, Miller may have had the furthest to go because he needed both physical reconstruction and psychological rehabilitation.\n\nFirst, the right knee. It buckled early in the Broncos\u2019 game Dec. 22, 2013, at Houston, and because of the swelling, surgery wasn\u2019t done until 18 days later.\n\nMiller didn\u2019t waste a minute of lost time.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I woke up from Dr. (James) Andrews\u2019 surgery, I was talking to rehab guys and I asked them, \u2018What can I do today?\u2019 \u201d Miller said. \u201cThey said \u2018nothing. You\u2019ve just got to rest.\u2019 I was like, there has to be something I can do.\u201d\n\nUpon returning to Denver, Miller found Harris to be a companion in rehabilitation misery. Harris had a 30 percent tear, while Miller\u2019s was more extensive.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a cornerback. I can\u2019t be outdone by a cornerback,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe had a healthy competition. I think we pushed each other. Had Chris not tore his ACL I\u2019m not sure where my recovery would be. And maybe I helped Chris with his recovery.\u201d\n\nSecond, Miller had to get himself right in ways of the mind, heart and soul. Or wherever growing up comes from. In psychology, maturity is defined as the ability to respond to the environment in an appropriate manner. Wikipedia quotes psychologist Jerome Bruner as defining immaturity as a \u201ctime of experimental play without serious consequences.\u201d\n\nOh, boy, does that sound familiar. And not only for Von Miller.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like all young people. You\u2019re hoping for maturity and growth as they move along,\u201d said Broncos coach John Fox. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the National Football League or raising four children myself or with your own kids, you try to teach guys the right way. Sometimes they make mistakes, but I\u2019ve seen tremendous growth, I think not only as a football player but as a young man.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been very pleased and proud of what he\u2019s done and how he\u2019s come back, whether it was off a suspension or whether it was off an ACL, which is a very serious injury and a very grueling injury to recover from. I think it speaks volumes for him and the way he attacked that.\u201d\n\nThe old Von, it was said, had to be constantly reminded about meetings, if not all but escorted to them. But Jack Del Rio, the Broncos\u2019 defensive coordinator, said it\u2019s an exaggeration to say Miller used to miss meetings or show up late for them.\n\n\u201cI mean, Coach Fox wouldn\u2019t allow that,\u201d Del Rio said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a difference between being there and participating and (just) being there. I think the maturity level is there in participating in the meetings. And in some cases leading the meetings. That part has dramatically changed over the last three years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to get in the Hall of Fame\u201d\n\nSo what was the most difficult obstacle Miller overcame? The recovery from an ACL tear or rehabilitation of his reputation?\n\nMiller said it was dealing with both at once.\n\n\u201cWhen I tore my ACL, the easy thing would have been, \u2018Man, I\u2019m not dealing with all this,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cWith the media on me, with the rehab, I\u2019m just going to walk away from it all. That would have been the easy thing to do. But for me, I just couldn\u2019t take that for an answer.\n\n\u201cI got my priorities in order. I\u2019ve always loved playing football. Let\u2019s start there. I wouldn\u2019t be here, I wouldn\u2019t have fought through all that adversity, if I didn\u2019t love playing football. This is not all about collecting a paycheck, making plays, sometimes. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s about for me. It\u2019s about being consistent over time. It\u2019s about being great. Eventually, I want to get in the Hall of Fame. I want to be the greatest at what I do.\u201d\n\nHe might as well. He has the ability.\n\nPeople who knew Miller aren\u2019t surprised by his comeback. He was always a good person at heart. He could mess up with the best of them, but he was always kind to teammates. Always had a good word for them, never a critical one.\n\nHere\u2019s another definition of maturity: It\u2019s about thinking of others first, then yourself. It\u2019s why being on time is considered a characteristic of maturity. Showing up late may be a personal choice, but others are affected.\n\nMiller gets it. He admits the execution continues to be a work in progress. But he gets it.\n\n\u201cI know the game, I know the calls. I\u2019m definitely a better linebacker than I was,\u201d Miller said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not only about me. I\u2019ve got to start inspiring other guys to play at an elite level.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had opportunities to win a Super Bowl before, but not like it is now. I can\u2019t really explain it. Now, it\u2019s like we\u2019ve got to do this for the Broncos organization that believed in me. That did all this stuff not just for me, but all of these guys. Bringing in all the guys that we have. Aqib (Talib), T.J. (Ward), even Peyton (Manning), we brought him in three years ago. The (new) indoor facility. All the things we have are because of this one moment.\u201d\n\nThe grown-up Von Miller wants all Broncos to experience football heaven.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Growth of Broncos star retains only the best of the \u201cthe old Von\u201d", "title": "Growth of Broncos star retains only the best of the \u201cthe old Von\u201d", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/03/growth-of-broncos-star-retains-only-the-best-of-the-the-old-von/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150103__20150104_C1_SP04FBNBRONXp1.jpg", "height": 434}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150103__20150104_C1_SP04FBNBRONXp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-03T20:04:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T04:32:38+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb2fa\"", "article_summary": "All the things we have are because of this one moment.\u201dThe grown-up Von Miller wants all Broncos to experience football heaven.\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s the National Football League or raising four children myself or with your own kids, you try to teach guys the right way.\nAsked to critique his season, Miller said: \u201cIt was all right.\nI think he understands that with the ability he\u2019s been given, he has a responsibility to be a leader and do things the right way.\nAnybody out there believe 18 months ago the Broncos would have been better off getting rid of him?"}
