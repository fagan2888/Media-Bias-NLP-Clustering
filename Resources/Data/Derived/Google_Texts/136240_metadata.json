While the Bronx had the most cases of severe overcrowding with 74 percent, Staten Island came in second with almost 54 percent.\n\nRELATED: New report details New York City's affordable housing 'crisis'\n\nBrooklyn City Councilman Jumaane Williams, who chairs the council's housing and buildings committee said the report repeats what many already know.\n\n\"We continue to see the pressure that housing takes in New York City,\" Williams said. \"It's been like that since I was a tenant organizer. It mirrors what we saw then but even worse.\"\n\nWilliams added that City Hall's focus on creating affordable housing was certainly one part of a larger, long-term solution to keep New York City affordable for those who feel forced to move into apartments with loved ones.\n\n\"We have to continue to work on improving rent regulation,\" Williams said. \"If we can't address that we might as well be pouring water in a bucket with a hole in it.\"\n\nIn July, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed off on a controversial package to extend rent regulation in the city that critics argued would cost the city almost 100,000 units of affordable housing.\n\nCuomo defended the package as \"the best rent reform package in history.\"\n\n\"But Albany failed tenants this past spring by continuing to weaken the protections that we had,\" the Met Council's Farkas said. \"They could pass stronger rent laws, and they can do that at any time.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "A new report released Monday that more than 1.4 million New Yorkers live in overcrowded homes surprised few housing observers.", "author": "Chester Soria", "og": {"site_name": "Metro", "description": "A new report released Monday that more than 1.4 million New Yorkers live in overcrowded homes surprised few housing observers.", "title": "New report says NYC apartments are increasingly crowded", "url": "http://www.metro.us/new-york/new-report-says-nyc-apartments-are-increasingly-crowded/zsJoje---zhu5xwjndhSr2/", "image": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$6j26x8h71l9gl1lydyl97w824ud6hxe/download.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "metro.us", "description": "A new report released Monday that more than 1.4 million New Yorkers live in overcrowded homes surprised few housing observers.", "creator": "Chester Soria", "image": {"src": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$6j26x8h71l9gl1lydyl97w824ud6hxe/download.jpeg"}, "title": "New report says NYC apartments are increasingly crowded", "site": "@Metro_US", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9F42CC1BA36D4325E006BBA620C3B678", "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "mediatype": "Article", "keywords": "nyc housing, scott stringer, overcrowded apartments, nyc apartments,", "fb": {"app_id": 1610587402522117, "pages": 146825895340972}, "date": "2015-10-05", "article": {"contentgroup": "Article Automatic,NYC,New York City,News,Housing,Affordable Housing,Top Stories New York", "section": "/new-york", "published_time": "2015-10-05T23:22:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-10-05T23:48:06Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "nyc housing, scott stringer, overcrowded apartments, nyc apartments,"}, "article_summary": "Almost a quarter of crowded homes reported earning less than $22,000 a year per household.\nGeographically, the report saw the largest jump in crowded dwellings in Brooklyn, with the proportion of crowded apartments and homes increasing by 28 percent.\nEvery other borough saw its own increase in crowded homes of between 10 to 12 percent, but for Staten Island, where homes actually got less crowded by some 8.6 percent.\nOverall, most of the overcrowded homes \u2014 about 92 percent \u2014 were homes with family relationships, not roommates.\nA new report released Monday that more than 1.4 million New Yorkers live in overcrowded homes surprised few housing observers."}
