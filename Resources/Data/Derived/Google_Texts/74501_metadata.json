John Cornyn\u2019s staff announced earlier today that the senior senator from Texas has signed onto an amendment to \u201cmake all federal government employees subject to Obamacare.\u201d\n\nCornyn\u2019s statement reads:\n\n\u201cCongress should never exempt itself or the federal government from a law it forces onto the American people. Obamacare is bad for everyone in the country, which is why I have fought it tooth and nail for the better part of four years to see that every American is exempt. But until we can defund, repeal or replace it, everyone in the country ought to be treated exactly the same and there should be no special deals for anyone.\u201d\n\nThe senator\u2019s position on the Affordable Care Act is crystal clear (he\u2019s against it) but what does he mean when he says that \u201ceveryone in the country ought to be treated exactly the same and there should be no special deals for anyone?\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s signing on to an amendment to be introduced by Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has also argued that members of Congress and other federal employees should be \u201csubject to Obamacare.\u201d Paul, son of former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, told Fox News Sept. 23 that if Republicans can\u2019t stop Obamacare, they can at least make sure that every federal employee will be subjected to its rules.\n\n\u201cCongress should never exempt itself from any laws,\u201d he said, and argued that Chief Justice John Roberts should have to sign up for Obamacare, too.\n\nFine and all, but it gets a bit confusing.\n\nCongress hasn\u2019t exempted federal workers from Obamacare.\n\nTo being with, workers whose employers provide partially- or fully-subsidized health coverage \u2014 as Congress does \u2014 aren\u2019t eligible for the health exchanges.\n\nSo if federal employees don\u2019t have to use Obamacare that makes them exactly like every other employee in the country whose bosses provide some form of coverage as a benefit.\n\nBut it gets weirder than that. The Affordable Care Act already singled out many employees, especially those who work for or serve in Congress. Unlike any other group of employees in America, it requires those employees to give up their employer-provided coverage and enter the exchanges. (Not everyone: Paul\u2019s amendment would expand that rule to justices and others.)\n\nThat\u2019s not treating them like everyone else, it\u2019s singling them out.\n\nSo far, so good. Unsurprisingly, staffers have asked \u2014 well, if we have to give up the insurance plans we like, will our bosses (the government) share the cost of our premiums, like most other employers in the country do?\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget said yes. Some in Congress have said no way \u2014 and thus the talk about ending special treatment got serious.\n\nOf course that\u2019s not special treatment \u2014 if the same thing private employees would be asking for if their bosses suddenly decided to stop providing group health plans.\n\nBut here\u2019s a question you might be asking: If Obamacare is as good as the President claims, why would employees who are pushed off their employer plans and into the exchanges need any help to pay their premiums? Isn\u2019t the purpose of the exchanges to make the insurance cheaper for those who need it most?\n\nThat\u2019s a good question. But it has a better answer, and it\u2019s an answer that works whether you think Obamacare is a good idea or a bad one.\n\nThe exchanges \u2014 for good or ill \u2014 are designed to make insurance more affordable for people who buy it on their own, or who would buy it if only it were more affordable.\n\nSo, for people who don\u2019t already have employer-provided insurance, the rates provided through the exchange will likely be much better than what they would have to pay if they went looking for a policy on their own today. And for people who make low or mid-level incomes, the government subsidies provided will make them even cheaper.\n\nBut the out-of-pocket costs for premiums on the exchange will likely still be more than a worker would pay if he or she had employer-provided coverage. That\u2019s because in those cases, the company picks up most of the costs. (And that\u2019s why those folks aren\u2019t eligible for the exchanges in the first place.)\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, from the point of view of the federal employees, is that because they have better than decent jobs, many of them will either make too much money for the government subsidies or make enough so that the subsidies are very small.\n\nIt\u2019s complicated, and some are arguing that there is a conflict in the statutes that will allow the federal employees to stay in the same plans they\u2019ve always had. (If they\u2019re right, then the employees will truly be treated as other employees across the country.)\n\nBut most think that the law will mean a change in coverage for federal workers, especially those who work for Congress. And if Paul and Cornyn are successful, everyone who gets a paycheck from Uncle Sam will be buying their own insurance through the exchanges.\n\nWhether the government should continue to offset their health costs, using a stipend or some other means, or not is grounds for a perfectly legitimate debate. But it has very little resemblance to any goal of making sure that federal workers are \u201ctreated the same\u201d as everyone else.\n\nIt\u2019s a strange goal in the first place. Federal workers haven\u2019t ever been treated the same as the rest of us. After all, they get a paycheck from Uncle Sam and we don\u2019t.", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL2JpemJlYXRibG9nLmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tLzIwMTMvMDkvb2JhbWFjYXJlLXdoYXQtZG9lcy1pdC1tZWFuLXRvLXRyZWF0LWZlZGVyYWwtd29ya2Vycy1saWtlLWV2ZXJ5b25lLWVsc2UuaHRtbC8=", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Michael A.
