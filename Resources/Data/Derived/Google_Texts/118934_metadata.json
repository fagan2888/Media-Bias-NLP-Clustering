Patients who were debilitated or dying from physical diseases for which they were receiving regular medical treatment had to wait months for psychological help, she said. Some patients, she said, might not live long enough to make the next available appointment.\n\nRelated Stories\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell a family whose elderly mother is declining that I can\u2019t provide treatment until 2014,\u201d she wrote to her managers at the Kaiser Medical Center in Oakland in September 2013. In February, two years after assessing the second largest fine in its history, the California Department of Managed Health Care stepped in again, finding that Kaiser Foundation Health Plan had improved somewhat but still was short-changing patientson mental health care. The state is considering another fine against the health maintenance organization, which is not affiliated with Kaiser Health News.\n\n\u201cEvery time the DMHC has an edict, Kaiser Permanente has a way around it,\u201d said Ginne, who retired in September 2014.\n\nCalifornia has taken perhaps the most proactive stance in the nation in enforcing laws to ensure people with mental illnesses have fair and timely access to care. But even in this state, it\u2019s proving difficult to ensure mental patients truly have equal access to treatment. Parity laws, including a sweeping measure passed by the federal government in 2008 and an older California law, require insurers to provide mental health and substance abuse benefits on par with the coverage they offer for other medical care. And a separate state law requires insurers to provide patients with access to mental treatment within a specific timeframe \u2013 48 hours for an urgent visit and 10 business days for a non-urgent one.\n\nAfter the 2013 fine, Kaiser patients continued to face not just ongoing delays \u2013 they faced arbitrary limits on treatment in direct violation of the state\u2019s parity statute, officials found. The law was intended to prevent such things as annual caps on patient visits that would not typically be faced, for instance, by patient with another chronic illness such as diabetes or heart disease. Yet, according to the 2015 report, some Kaiser staffers told mental health patients that they were not entitled to long-term individual therapy \u2014 ever.\n\n\u201cNo one ever sees a therapist once a week in the Kaiser Health Plan,\u201d according to a 2014 email a Kaiser psychologist sent to a patient, which was cited in the state\u2019s most recent report. \u201cNot a covered benefit for the past 20-something years and will not be a benefit in the future.\u201d\n\nDr. Mason Turner, Kaiser Permanente\u2019s Associate Director of Regional Mental Health for Northern California, said that the organization has fixed the problems identified by the state. \u201cBetween the time the DMHC made their [initial] findings and now, we\u2019ve made substantial improvements, hired many more staff, and really put into place a lot of mechanisms to address the initial concerns that were brought up,\u201d Turner said in April.\n\nThe access problems, he said, were caused by an increase in demand, which rose in part because of the influx of new enrollees under the Affordable Care Act. In response, he said, Kaiser increased the ranks of therapists by 25 percent and arranged to contract with outside therapists when necessary.\n\nThis story is part of a partnership that includes KPCC, NPR and Kaiser Health News. It can be republished for free. (details)\n\nThe actions against Kaiser highlight both how far California has come in ensuring equal treatment for mental health patients and how far it has yet to go. On one hand, after many years of \u201cabysmal\u201d enforcement, \u201cnow we have regulators who seem to be enthusiastic,\u201d said Randall Hagar, director of government relations for the California Psychiatric Association. Hagar gives credit to managed health care department director Shelley Rouillard, who spent 20 years in consumer advocacy before joining the department in 2011 and becoming director in 2013.\n\nOn the other hand, critics say, Rouillard and her staff are making slow progress at best.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the \u2018pace car\u2019 states, and it\u2019s still slow going,\u201d said Carol McDaid, who runs the Parity Implementation Coalition, an advocacy group made up of addiction and mental health consumer and provider organizations.\n\nHolding Insurers Accountable\n\nIn challenging Kaiser Permanente in 2013, the state\u2019s managed care department took on one of the largest not-for-profit health plans in the country. It is a huge player in the California market, with almost 7.5 million members in the state and a net income nationally of $3.1 billion last year.\n\nBut officials soon realized the problems with unequal coverage of mental health were much broader.\n\nFor years, California, like most states and the federal government, relied on consumers to bring complaints alleging that their rights had been violated under parity laws. State regulators grew concerned that the approach was too passive \u2014 few consumers were complaining, perhaps because of the stigma attached to mental illness. So as a first step, the department last year began requiring insurers under its watch to show \u2014 at least on paper \u2013 that they were complying with federal parity law.\n\nThe results were not encouraging: Of 26 managed care insurers, from Aetna to Western Health Advantage, zero were able to prove that they were fully in compliance. Most filed incomplete or flawed documents, state officials said.\n\n\u201cIt is rather shocking,\u201d Rouillard said.\n\nPart of the problem, Rouillard said, is that the federal government did not release the final regulations dictating how its parity law should be enforced until November 2013 \u2013 five years after the law was passed.\n\nIn their review of documents, her department\u2019s analysts found it hard to even compare mental and general health care because of simple errors in the way insurers documented them, such as putting data in the wrong fields, Rouillard said. But she said they also found insurers trying to control costs in ways that could be discriminatory \u2014 for example, by limiting the number of days a patient could receive inpatient care for a mental health condition.\n\n\u201cMental health services are still sort of a second class benefit as far as the health plans are concerned,\u201d Rouillard said.\n\nAt this point, Rouillard says the managed care plans she regulates are in varying stages of compliance with the federal parity law. Just one plan, Health Net, has so far been able to prove on paper that its benefits fully comply. Rouillard says she expects the other plans to follow suit by the end of the year, and in 2016, the department plans a more intensive review.\n\nCharles Bacchi, President and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, disputed that insurers see mental health as a second-tier benefit. \u201cWe\u2019re committed to providing this coverage for our enrollees. It\u2019s very important, and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re working hard to do,\u201d he said.\n\nBut the law poses a huge challenge for health plans, he said, in part because the science underpinning diagnosis and treatment of mental illness is constantly evolving. In addition, health plans are trying to adapt not just to parity law but to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, which has transformed the national insurance landscape.\n\nEven so, he said, \u201cI think by the end of this year, all the plans will have filed the right documents and will have approval from the department, and this will be something that\u2019s in the rearview mirror.\u201d\n\n\u2018Your Hands Are Tied\u2019\n\nIn her psychiatry department, Ginne felt she was in a good position to compare patients\u2019 access to mental health treatment with other care. Many of them suffer from neurological or terminal diseases with psychological components \u2013 Alzheimer\u2019s, for instance, or Parkinson\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI could see from their medical charts that they were receiving all the medical care that they needed,\u201d Ginne said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t do that in psychiatry because we were so severely under-staffed.\u201d\n\nFinding that her situation did not improve even after the first investigation and fine, Ginne made a request of her managers \u2014 copied to Rouillard \u2013 in December 2013. She asked that six of her sickest patients be transferred to other providers who could see them more frequently. One of them, an elderly man with dementia and depression, was hallucinating \u201cfully-formed humans,\u201d Ginne said in an interview.\n\nOne day, he wandered down the block at 5 am in his pajamas, panicked, and flagged down a truck driver who called the police.\n\n\u201cHe was a danger to himself,\u201d Ginne said.\n\nAccording to Ginne, the backup in appointments meant she could see him for individual therapy only once every few months. The man had been assigned to regular group therapy, she said.\n\nBut because Kaiser did not have a session for dementia patients, he was in a depression group, which Ginne felt was inappropriate for his condition.\n\nWhen her supervisors did not transfer the man to another individual therapy provider, Ginne reported the case to Adult Protective Services, because she said she believed him to be imminent danger.\n\nIt was \u201csuch a bad solution,\u201d she said, shaking her head. Ultimately, he and his wife decided to quit therapy entirely.\n\n\u201cIt does something to your spirit to realize your hands are tied, that you are completely unable to do the work you\u2019re dedicated and trained to do,\u201d Ginne said.\n\nThe follow-up report released by the DMHC in February 2015 found Kaiser had improved its tracking of mental health patients but still had serious problems in the area of access to care. In one case, a sexual assault victim diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression tried to schedule both individual and group therapy visits, but her psychiatrist told her to seek private therapy in the community at her own expense.\n\nAccording to the doctor, \u201cweekly individual therapy was not available in the Plan, and Plan group therapy did not address sexual assault.\u201d The patient was eventually able to schedule an appointment with a Kaiser therapist \u2014 five months after her initial visit, the report said.\n\nIn another case cited by the report, a child with aggressive and sexualized behaviors at both home and school was brought in by her family in crisis. After an initial intake visit, the child was not seen for therapy until seven weeks later, though the medical chart indicated that the family had pleaded for treatment.\n\nRouillard said that many insurers have a long way to go to ensure fair and equal access to mental health care for Californians. But she also said there\u2019s only so much her department can do. Access to care at companies like Kaiser is also an issue of capacity \u2013 and that\u2019s not within the department\u2019s purview, she said.\n\n\u201cThere just aren\u2019t enough therapists to see everyone who needs help,\u201d she said. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just a plan problem; it\u2019s a societal problem. And that is really the crux of the matter. We\u2019re trying to address a problem that is beyond our ability to fix, and that is a challenge.\u201d\n\n* This piece originally aired on Kaiser Health News", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health, Science, Environment", "description": "After the state of California fined her employer $4 million in 2013 for violating the legal rights of mental health patients, Oakland psychologist Melinda", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "Crosscurrents", "og": {"url": "http://kalw.org/post/achieving-mental-health-parity", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kalw/files/styles/medium/public/201509/mental-parity-2.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "After the state of California fined her employer $4 million in 2013 for violating the legal rights of mental health patients, Oakland psychologist Melinda", "title": "Achieving Mental Health Parity"}, "org_id": 0, "has_audio": 1, "author": "Jenny Gold", "wordCount": 3498, "dc": {"title": "Achieving Mental Health Parity"}, "nid": 64314, "datePublished": "2015-09-23", "keywords": "mental health, Mental health parity, Kaiser Health News, Jenny Gold, Mental health care, health insurance, Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"site": "@kalw", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd37cb\"", "article_summary": "Charles Bacchi, President and CEO of the California Association of Health Plans, disputed that insurers see mental health as a second-tier benefit.\n\u201cMental health services are still sort of a second class benefit as far as the health plans are concerned,\u201d Rouillard said.\nIn February, two years after assessing the second largest fine in its history, the California Department of Managed Health Care stepped in again, finding that Kaiser Foundation Health Plan had improved somewhat but still was short-changing patientson mental health care.\nThe state is considering another fine against the health maintenance organization, which is not affiliated with Kaiser Health News.\nBut officials soon realized the problems with unequal coverage of mental health were much broader."}
