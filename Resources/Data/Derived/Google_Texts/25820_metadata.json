They are required to pay market value for the land, not the appraised value, as was part of the original agreement.\n\nThe team does have the right to delay the development of each parcel for up to two years if it pays what is being called a \u201cpause fee\u201d equal to $12,500 a month. That would amount to $300,000 over two years.\n\nMary Conturo, SEA executive director, said the Penguins would be able to use $15 million in credits negotiated as part of the Consol Energy deal to pay the fee. The credits were part of the original option agreement and remain in effect.\n\nThe Penguins are proposing to build 1,100 units of housing, 500,000 to 600,000 square feet of office space and 250,000 square feet of commercial space on the former arena site. It also has agreed to devote three acres to green space.\n\nTravis Williams, the Penguins\u2019 chief operating officer, said the team intends to move quickly to submit a preliminary land development plan to the city now that the revised option agreement and the broader community deal have been negotiated.\n\nThe team likely will start the development near Crawford Square with housing. It has hired McCormack Baron Salazar, the same developer that did Crawford Square, as its residential developer.\n\nSEA board member Sala Udin, a former city councilman whose family was displaced when houses were demolished in the lower Hill to make way for the Civic Arena, said the development has the potential to \u201crestore the Hill District to its former historic glory.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "SEA board members approved a revised agreement with the team that sets Oct. 22, 2015, as the deadline for the start of\u00a0development.", "og": {"site_name": "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "description": "The Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority took the first steps Thursday toward creating the largest tax diversion district in the city\u2019s history as part of the proposed redevelopment of the former Civic Arena site.
