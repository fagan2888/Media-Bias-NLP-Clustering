But he made a point of continuing to live his life \u2014 at work and outside of it.\n\nThat fight ended Sunday when Scott, the longtime \u201cSportsCenter\u201d anchor and ESPN personality known for his enthusiasm and ubiquity, died at age 49.\n\nPHOTOS: Celebrity deaths in 2015\n\nScott remained dedicated to his craft even as he suffered through chemotherapy, radiation and surgery.\n\nESPN President John Skipper said in a statement that Scott was \u201ca true friend and a uniquely inspirational figure\u201d and that his \u201cenergetic and unwavering devotion to his family and to his work while fighting the battle of his life left us in awe, and he leaves a void that can never be replaced.\u201d\n\nSkipper also marveled at Scott\u2019s dedication to keep fighting \u2014 literally.\n\n\u201cWho engages in mixed martial arts training in the midst of chemotherapy treatments?\u201d Skipper said. \u201cWho leaves a hospital procedure to return to the set?\u201d\n\nFans and players at games around the United States on Sunday stopped to observe moments of silence, including at the Bengals-Colts NFL playoff game in Indianapolis, Lions-Cowboys in Arlington, Texas; the Mavericks-Cavaliers NBA game in Cleveland and at several college basketball games.\n\nSome of the world\u2019s most famous athletes expressed their grief online. LeBron James wrote on Instagram: \u201cThank you so much for being [you] and giving us inner city kids someone we could relate to that wasn\u2019t a player but was close enough to them.\u201d\n\n\u201cStuart wasn\u2019t covering heroes [and] champions, it was the other way around,\u201d Tiger Woods wrote on Twitter.\n\nIn July, Scott accepted the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at the ESPYs. During his speech, he told his teenage daughters: \u201cTaelor and Sydni, I love you guys more than I will ever be able to express. You two are my heartbeat. I am standing on this stage here tonight because of you.\u201d\n\nScott is also survived by his parents, O. Ray and Jacqueline Scott; siblings Stephen Scott, Synthia Kearney and Susan Scott; his daughters Taelor, 19, and Sydni, 15; and girlfriend Kristin Spodobalski.\n\nOn Sunday morning, NFL Network broadcaster Rich Eisen\u2019s voice broke as he reported the death of his good friend, with whom he worked on \u201cSportsCenter\u201d broadcasts.\n\n\u201cI love this man,\u201d Eisen said.\n\nESPN anchor Hannah Storm called him \u201cour colleague, our friend and our inspiration\u201d as she reported the news. On the network\u2019s NFL pregame show, Chris Berman said, \u201cStuart made ESPN what it is, he made us better people.\u201d\n\nBefore North Carolina\u2019s women\u2019s basketball team tipped off against N.C. State, the arena observed a moment of silence for Scott, and the videoboard proclaimed the 1987 graduate \u201cForever a Tar Heel.\u201d\n\nBorn in Chicago, Scott attended high school in North Carolina before going to UNC. He returned to Chapel Hill as the university\u2019s commencement speaker in 2001.\n\nScott worked at three TV stations in the southern U.S. before joining ESPN for the 1993 launch of its ESPN2 network, hosting short sports update segments.\n\nHe often anchored the 11 p.m. \u201cSportsCenter,\u201d where he would punctuate highlights with an emphatic \u201cBoo-ya!\u201d or note a slick move as being \u201cas cool as the other side of the pillow.\u201d\n\nScott went on to cover countless major events for the network, including the Super Bowl, NBA Finals, World Series and NCAA basketball tournament. He also interviewed President Barack Obama, joining him for a televised game of one on one.\n\n\u201cI will miss Stuart Scott,\u201d Obama said in a statement. \u201cStu helped usher in a new way to talk about our favorite teams and the day\u2019s best plays. For much of those 20 years, public service and campaigns have kept me from my family \u2014 but wherever I went, I could flip on the TV and Stu and his colleagues on \u201cSportsCenter\u201d were there. \u2026 Michelle and I offer our thoughts and prayers to his family, friends and colleagues.\u201d\n\nIn July, when he accepted the ESPY award named for former N.C. State coach Jim Valvano, who died of cancer in 1993, Scott shared what he had learned from his struggle: \u201cWhen you die, that does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and the manner in which you live.\n\n\u201cSo live. Live.
