If you’re a drug or device manufacturer, you’re currently required to report to the government certain payments you make to physicians and teaching hospitals. A recently introduced bill would expand that reporting requirement to include physician assistants, nurse practitioners, certified nurse anesthetists, clinical nurse specialists and certified nurse midwives.

The Provider Payment Sunshine Act (S. 2153) was introduced by Sens. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and referred to the Senate Finance Committee. The expanding reporting requirements for the Open Payments program would go into effect in 2017.

Sen. Grassley said the Open Payments program is intended to benefit the consumer by providing them with information on physician payments, according to an Oct. 13 statement, and said expanding reporting to anyone who prescribes medicine makes sense.

Sen. Blumenthal also said that increased access to payment information would benefit the consumer. “Requiring companies to disclose gifts and payments made to other health care providers – not just doctors – is absolutely essential,” Blumenthal said in an Oct. 13 statement.

The Open Payments program was created by Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act, and is often referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. The law requires manufacturers of drugs, devices and other medical supplies and group purchasing organizations (GPOs) to report certain payments made to physicians or teaching hospitals that are over $10.21.

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services released its first Open Payments report in September 2014, noting that physicians and teaching hospitals received $3.43 billion over the final five months of 2013. The first report covering a full year of payments was released June 30 and said drug and device manufacturers paid $6.49 billion to physicians and teaching hospitals over the course of 2014.
