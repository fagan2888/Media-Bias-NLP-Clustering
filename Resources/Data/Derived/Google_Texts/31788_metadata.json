The Maple Grove company, which has stocked and maintained jewelry and sunglass displays at Target stores for decades, followed the retailer north of the border in 2011.\n\n\u201cWe hired and trained 200 employees across Canada,\u201d said Phil Lamers, president of Retail Merchandising Services. \u201cThe hiring, the background checks, to do all that it was hundreds of thousands of dollars.\u201d\n\nRetail Merchandising Services will continue to work with the retail giant in the U.S. Target owes the company $211,000, according to court documents, but Lamers said the amount is $340,000.\n\nIf Target does not pay, it won\u2019t sink the firm, but it will hurt.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t have a profit-sharing contribution for 2014. And I\u2019ve had to borrow more money,\u201d Lamers said. \u201cWe have a line of credit and we\u2019ve got to use that to a greater degree than I would like. It\u2019s unfortunate. It\u2019s also part of life, part of business.\u201d\n\nLamers said he hopes to recover at least part of what he\u2019s owed in the bankruptcy process.\n\nTarget Canada says it\u2019s committed to a fair and orderly process as it winds down operations, Minnesota Public Radio reported (http://bit.ly/1JlNRPa ).\n\nToronto lawyer Lou Brzezinski, who represents some of the creditors, said how much investors recoup in the end will depend on the sale of Target Canada\u2019s store leases.\n\n\u201cIf they sell all of them, the landlords\u2019 claims will be next to nothing,\u201d Brzezinski said. \u201cIf they sell half of them, there\u2019ll be substantial landlord claims, which will dilute the amount available to creditors.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The end of Target's Canadian operations is having a financial impact on businesses in Minnesota that supplied the retailer.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/feb/16/target-canada-suppliers-hit-by-retailers-bankruptc/", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The end of Target\u2019s Canadian operations is having a financial impact on businesses in Minnesota that supplied the retailer.", "title": "Target Canada suppliers hit by retailer\u2019s bankruptcy filing"}, "twitter": {"title": "Target Canada suppliers hit by retailer\u2019s bankruptcy filing", "description": "The end of Target's Canadian operations is having a financial impact on businesses in Minnesota that supplied the retailer.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf2ca\"", "article_summary": "Target\u2019s Canadian division filed for bankruptcy protection last month and owes nearly $5 million to Minnesota suppliers and service providers, including Retail Merchandising Services.\n\u201cWe hired and trained 200 employees across Canada,\u201d said Phil Lamers, president of Retail Merchandising Services.\nTarget Canada says it\u2019s committed to a fair and orderly process as it winds down operations, Minnesota Public Radio reported (http://bit.ly/1JlNRPa ).\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - The end of Target\u2019s Canadian operations is having a financial impact on businesses in Minnesota that supplied the retailer.\nIf Target does not pay, it won\u2019t sink the firm, but it will hurt."}
