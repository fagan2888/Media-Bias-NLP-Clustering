But that will not stop it from wreaking more havoc than usual with the tides, among other phenomena.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t expect to see anything special, not even a little crescent,\u201d says Earthsky.org. \u201cA full moon supermoon is out all night\u2014brighter than your average full moon. But a new moon supermoon is only out during the daytime hours, hidden in the sun\u2019s glare.\u201d\n\nNot only is this month\u2019s super moon new, but it\u2019s also known as the Black Moon, given its status as the third new moon falling between the winter solstice in December and the spring equinox in March, Earthsky.org explains. There are four new moons in all during this season, whereas the norm is three, according to the Weather Channel. Thus, although the moon this week is invisible, the \"black\" epithet is not related to its absence of reflected light. What makes February\u2019s moon super is its proximity to Earth.\n\n\u201cThe moon reaches lunar perigee\u2014the moon\u2019s closest point to Earth for the month\u2014less than eight hours after the moon turns new at 23:47 UTC on February 18,\u201d Earthsky.org says. In fact the February super moon is the second-closest for the year, according to Earthsky.org.\n\nAnd the convergence of the two phenomena is what sets February\u2019s new moon apart from all the other supermoons, Earthsky.org says. The first one of the year was on January 20, and the second will fall on March 20. The year\u2019s three other super moons will be full.\n\nMeanwhile, Earthsky.org notes, keep an eye on the weather, lest the more pronounced tides of February\u2019s new moon sneak up on you.\n\n\u201cThe February 18 extra-close new moon will accentuate the spring tide, giving rise to what\u2019s called a perigean spring tide,\u201d Earthsky.org says. \u201cIf you live along an ocean coastline, watch for high tides caused by the February 2015 perigean new moon\u2014or supermoon. It\u2019s likely to follow the date of new moon by a day or so.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "If you feel a looming dark presence from above on Wednesday February 18, it is not your imagination.This week's new moon is also a super moon, and a Black Moon - the third in a four-series season, when three is the norm.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/02/14/looming-invisible-new-moon-wreaks-tidal-havoc-159199", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/crescent-new_moon-istock_000049316294.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Looming, Invisible New Moon Wreaks Tidal Havoc"}, "abstract": "This week's new moon is also a super moon, and a Black Moon - the third in a four-series season, when three is the norm.", "dc": {"title": "Looming, Invisible New Moon Wreaks Tidal Havoc"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/02/14/looming-invisible-new-moon-wreaks-tidal-havoc-159199", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 0}, "dcterms.date": "2015-02-14T13:00-05:00", "dcterms.title": "Looming, Invisible New Moon Wreaks Tidal Havoc"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0d38\"", "article_summary": "\u201cA full moon supermoon is out all night\u2014brighter than your average full moon.\nWhat makes February\u2019s moon super is its proximity to Earth.\nIn fact the February super moon is the second-closest for the year, according to Earthsky.org.\nIt is the second of six super moons coming our way this year\u2014and, like the one before and the one after it, this one is a new moon, and thus invisible.\n\u201cThe moon reaches lunar perigee\u2014the moon\u2019s closest point to Earth for the month\u2014less than eight hours after the moon turns new at 23:47 UTC on February 18,\u201d Earthsky.org says."}
