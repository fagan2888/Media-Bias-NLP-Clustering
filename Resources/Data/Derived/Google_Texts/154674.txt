A woman is dead after a car crash Friday night on State Road 79 in Washington County.

According to Florida Highway Patrol officials, Brenda Anderson, 64, was traveling northbound on State Road 79, and a second car, being driven by Bruce Fountain Jr., was traveling southbound on State Road 79 at the same time.

Reports say, Anderson made a left turn onto Ira Road, and immediately made a U-turn to get back onto S.R. 79. While attempting to do so, Anderson came into the path of Fountain's car.

The two cars collided, and the impact of the crash caused Anderson's car to become submerged in a retention pond.

Anderson was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash, and was pronounced dead at the scene. Fountain and his passenger were not injured.

The investigation is pending and officials say alcohol was not a factor.
