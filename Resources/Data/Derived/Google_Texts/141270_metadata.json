The Manhattan Institute\u2019s Avik Roy even wrote maybe 2,000 columns and a little e-book promoting this theme.\n\nMost recently, in last week\u2019s Republican debate, Carly Fiorina earned her second Politifact \u201cPants on Fire\u201d with her statement that \u201cObamacare isn\u2019t helping anyone.\u201d Presumably to explain away the greatest decline in the uninsured since the 1960s, Fiorina argued, \u201cWe\u2019re [just] throwing more, and more people into Medicaid.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve tangled with many people about this question, for example in this fairly typical Twitter exchange:\n\nSuch criticism doesn\u2019t come from nowhere. My wife and I don\u2019t need Twitter mansplain ations to know that Medicaid undermines access by underpaying providers , or that Medicaid has other problems. We\u2019ve relied on Medicaid to care for her brother Vincent many years now.\n\nStill, the fact is that Medicaid compares surprisingly well with private insurance in patient satisfaction and in other key measures. Aaron Carroll and Austin Frakt lament \u201cZombie Medicaid arguments\u201d which criticize the program based on stereotypes or misinterpreted studies.\n\nJAMA Pediatrics survey: Medicaid gets a bad rap\n\nWhich \u2026 brings us to this week\u2019s study in JAMA Pediatrics, \u201cQuality of Health Insurance Coverage and Access to Care for Children in Low-Income Families,\u201d by Amanda Kreider and her colleagues.\n\nThese researchers examined 2003-12 data concerning 80,655 children collected in the National Survey of Children\u2019s Health. All of these children came from households reporting pretty modest annual incomes, between 100 percent and 300 percent of the federal poverty line. That\u2019s roughly between $20,000 and $60,000 for a family of three. Fifty-seven percent of the children relied upon private insurance. Eighteen percent were covered through the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). Fourteen percent relied on Medicaid. Eleven percent were uninsured.\n\nKreider and colleagues examined the impact of insurance on many parent-reported outcomes: access to and use of primary and specialty care, unmet health care needs, out-of-pocket costs, effective care coordination, and satisfaction with care. Their methodology was quite simple as research papers go. They performed standard statistical adjustments to account for differences in household income, child age, gender, race, and other characteristics. They then computed predicted probabilities of each outcome corresponding to the same child being (a) uninsured, (b) receiving Medicaid, (c) receiving CHIP, or (d) holding private insurance.\n\nI\u2019ve graphed some of their main results for children with special needs (CSHCN) below.*\n\nTheir results \u2013 alongside others \u2013 underscores two points.\n\nServing kids with special health care needs\n\nThe first is precisely what faithful readers would expect me to say. Medicaid gets a really bad rap. When it comes to children with special health care needs, Medicaid is often better than the available public or private alternatives. The program could obviously be improved. Then again, so could these other forms of insurance coverage.\n\nFor ten out of 14 access and satisfaction measures, parents of children with health care needs rated Medicaid better than private insurance. (Private insurance was rated better on two remaining categories, in each case by one percentage point. Two outcomes were tied.)\n\nNot surprisingly, having any form of insurance was vastly better than being uninsured in this population. Medicaid was also ranked at least slightly superior to CHIP on all 14 measures.The most concerning differences arose in out-of-pocket costs. Medicaid recipients were much less likely to face these burdens than were those with other forms of coverage.\n\nScores were closer within the whole population of (mostly-healthy) kids. Medicaid only beat out private coverage by a score of 7-4, with three ties. Yet the overall pattern was pretty similar, especially in preventive care.\n\nMedicaid offers more comprehensive long-term disability services and supports than Medicare or private insurance does. Medicaid has fewer hidden traps or unexpected out-of-pocket payments. It is really designed for low-income people. State Medicaid programs also have decades of experience serving children and adults living with disabilities. Medicaid-funded providers have often pioneered integrated care models and the use of team care, providing the foundation for Accountable Care Organizations and related integrated care efforts.\n\nMedicaid is also designed with some attention to social determinants of health and child development. For example, Medicaid has a long history of providing school-based services for children who require these supports. Medicaid\u2019s Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) program covers a rather remarkable range of important services for low-income children and those with special needs.\n\nFilling gaps in marketplace coverage\n\nMy second point is less of a fan-boy comment about ACA. I\u2019m quite concerned about the capacity of the new state marketplaces to serve children with significant health problems.\n\nMarketplaces will serve many children (and adults) with special health care needs. And qualified health plans (QHPs) are required to cover pediatric services as an essential health benefit. Yet as Kreider and her colleagues note, a recent review of state benchmark plans (on which QHPs are based) indicated that none of the benchmark plans specifically delineated which pediatric services must be covered. QHPs are modeled after employer plans, which have traditionally provided limited coverage for children with special health care needs.\n\nGrace and colleagues note a disturbing pattern by which some QHPs exclude coverage for pediatric developmental and mental health services. Many excluded categories concern habilitative services, that is \u201chealth care services that help a person keep, learn, or improve skills and functioning for daily living.\u201d Habilitative services include speech therapy, many forms of physical and occupational therapy, services for autism or developmental delays, and related services designed to promote healthy development. Many such services (though not all) are typically reimbursed by Medicaid.\n\nThis is a huge concern for many children who require habilitative therapies and specialty care \u2013 not to mention those who require new wheelchairs, durable medical equipment, or many other things. QHPs also routinely impose much higher cost-sharing than is found within Medicaid. Their provider networks may or may not encompass important pediatric specialties.\n\nWe don\u2019t yet know how marketplaces will work for children with special healthcare needs, or how private insurance plans should harmonize what they offer to match Medicaid and CHIP. With so many contentious political, policy, and clinical issues in-play, policymakers, clinicians, and advocates have not given these issues their due. It\u2019s time they do. Medicaid\u2019s best efforts provide a valuable foundation for these efforts.\n\n* I added one bar, assuming that 100 percent of the uninsured are responsible for out-of-pocket payments for medical services.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When it comes to children with special health care needs, Medicaid is often better than the available public or private alternatives.
