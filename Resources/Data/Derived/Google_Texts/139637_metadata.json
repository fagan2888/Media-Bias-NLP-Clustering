A report published in a recent edition of The Lancet has highlighted a 30-year-old white man who suffered bilateral central vision loss as a result of inhaling poppers. Researchers from the UK fear more cases of what they call \u201cpoppers maculopathy\u201d will be reported due to the drug\u2019s ingredients.\n\n\u201cOver the past 18 months or so I have come across almost 10 patients with poppers maculopathy, whilst several years ago I had not even heard of the condition, same with a lot of my colleagues. I felt it was important to raise the issue and increase awareness,\u201d Dr. Anna Gruener, lead researcher from the Department of Ophthalmology at Guy\u2019s and St Mary\u2019s Foundation Trust in London told Reuters Health. \u201cI would like people to realize that poppers can potentially be very damaging, that there is no cure for poppers maculopathy and that prevention \u2014 avoidance of poppers \u2014 is therefore key.\u201d\n\nAccording to Gruener and her colleagues, the man had no history of macular degeneration prior to their examination. Although they were unable to provide a direct reason that explained why poppers caused damage to central photoreceptors, they were able to establish a clear cause and effect relationship. When the research checked in with the man six months after stopping his use of poppers, they discovered that his visual acuity did not improve, meaning his vision loss could be permanent.\n\n\u201cPeople seemed to regard poppers as relatively safe, and visual loss from inhalation of poppers was unheard of,\u201d Gruener said in regard to the 1970s, when the drug was popular among members of the gay community. \u201cPeople came up with the name 'poppers' as the lids or caps of the glass vials or tubes that contained the liquid had to be \u2018popped off\u2019 before the contents could be inhaled.\u201d\n\nCases of poppers maculopathy were reported by French ophthalmologists in 2010 and 2011 after several patients suffering from central vision loss admitted to using the alkyl nitrite compound. The first cases involving vision loss caused by poppers use in the UK were reported in 2012. Poppers, which start off as a liquid before turning into gas at room temperature, relax blood vessels leading to sudden drops in blood pressure and muscle relaxation. Common side effects include nausea, dizziness, and headaches.\n\nSource: Jeffries M, El Housseini Z, Whitefield L, Gruener A. Poppers maculopathy.
