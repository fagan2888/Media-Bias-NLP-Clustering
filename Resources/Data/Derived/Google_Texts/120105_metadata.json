(Photo: Frank Galipo)Buy Photo\n\nThe attempt at a world record fell short, but a Manalapan family\u2019s quest to shine a light on a devastating childhood disease continues to draw backers.\n\nThe Manalapan police department and Keller Williams Realty are partnering with Jim and Karen Raffone\u2019s JAR of Hope Foundation in different but significant ways in the coming days.\n\nThe Raffones, whose 6-year-old son Jamesy suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, orchestrated an Aug. 23 gathering that fell just short of breaking the Guinness mark for biggest crowd doing simultaneous push-ups (615). It did, however, raise $12,380 for research on Duchenne, a rare and ultimately fatal degenerative condition.\n\nManalapan police officers who provided security at the event invited Jim Raffone to join them in doing 10 push-ups in solidarity with Jamesy prior to Friday\u2019s 9/11 memorial service in front of the town hall. The service starts at 6 p.m.\n\nOn Saturday, Keller Williams is throwing a JAR of Hope fundraiser picnic at Ivy League Day Camp on Gordons Corner Road in Manalapan. The picnic runs from noon to 5 p.m. and includes food, games, swimming and other activities.\n\n\u201cThe way the community is responding is truly remarkable,\u201d Jim Raffone said. \u201cIt just proves that once you get the truth of the disease out there, it really touches people. The gravity of this disease really grabs you.\u201d\n\nTickets for the picnic cost $35 for adults and $20 for children ages 5-16 (children 4 and under are free). They must be reserved in advance and can be purchased at Keller Williams\u2019 offices in Morganville, Jackson and Shrewsbury. For information, call 732-536-9010.\n\nStaff writer Jerry Carino: jcarino@gannettnj.com.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1UGG6n8", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "With momentum from its world-record push-ups attempt, the Manalapan-based charity has a busy few days ahead.", "og": {"site_name": "Asbury Park Press", "description": "With momentum from its world-record push-ups attempt, the Manalapan-based charity has a busy few days ahead.", "title": "More push-ups, picnic for JAR of Hope Foundation", "url": "http://www.app.com/story/news/local/monmouth-county/2015/09/09/more-push-ups-picnic-jar-hope-foundation/71918236/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/app.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "With momentum from its world-record push-ups attempt, the Manalapan-based charity has a busy few days ahead.", "title": "More push-ups, picnic for JAR of Hope Foundation", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8f93de220c7a6f7252e64cd4762c12195314a18a/c=67-0-333-266&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/09/09/NJGroup/AsburyPark/635773550853249791-jar-collins.jpg", "creator": "@AsburyParkPress", "site": "@AsburyParkPress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600068887", "fb": {"app_id": 116172675120111}, "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "viewport": "width=1070"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd39e5\"", "article_summary": "The Manalapan police department and Keller Williams Realty are partnering with Jim and Karen Raffone\u2019s JAR of Hope Foundation in different but significant ways in the coming days.\nBuy Photo Former New York Giants star Mark Collins (left) with Jim Raffone and his son Jamesy at last month's push-ups challenge.\nThe service starts at 6 p.m.On Saturday, Keller Williams is throwing a JAR of Hope fundraiser picnic at Ivy League Day Camp on Gordons Corner Road in Manalapan.\nThey must be reserved in advance and can be purchased at Keller Williams\u2019 offices in Morganville, Jackson and Shrewsbury.\n\u201cThe way the community is responding is truly remarkable,\u201d Jim Raffone said."}
