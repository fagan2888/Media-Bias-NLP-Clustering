Erica Skowron scored for the Crusaders soon after, increasing their lead to 2-0.\n\nLake Norman (17-2) responded with two goals from Julianna Dworschak and one each from Michella Chester and Carly Vaccaro, giving the Wildcats a 4-2 lead.\n\nThree goals from Cardinal Gibbons and one more from Lake Norman tied the game at 5-5 going into halftime.\n\nThe Wildcats took a lead early in the second half off a goal from Kieran Rinaldi, but Sarah Comstock quickly scored for the Crusaders and tied the game again, this time at 6-6.\n\nThe tie did not last long as Lake Norman quickly scored three unanswered goals. However, Gibbons equalized the surge with three unanswered goals of their own just minutes later.\n\nRinaldi broke the 9-9 tie, but the Crusaders stayed close. The two teams traded goals until the Wildcats were able to net two in a row, both from Vaccaro. But a yellow card to Lake Norman allowed Cardinal Gibbons to score twice and tie the game at 13-13 with just minutes remaining in the game.\n\nWith :24 left in the game, Cardinal Gibbons was given a yellow card and the Wildcats were able to capitalize. Rinaldi scored with just :19 left to give Lake Norman a 14-13 lead.\n\nThe Crusaders drove down the field after winning the ensuing draw. Dworschak scored as time expired to tie the game at 14-14 and send the championship game to overtime.\n\nJust over a minute into the first overtime period, Lake Norman\u2019s Vaccaro scored on a feed from Dworschak to give the Wildcats a 15-14 lead.\n\nCardinal Gibbons\u2019 Comstock would tie the game again with just :25 left in the first overtime, but it didn\u2019t last long. Rinaldi found the net again 15 seconds later to give the lead back to the Wildcats.\n\nKieran Rinaldi sealed the Lake Norman victory; she scored with 1:42 left in the second overtime, bringing the final score to 17-15.\n\nThis win marks the first girl\u2019s lacrosse state championship for the Lake Norman Wildcats.
