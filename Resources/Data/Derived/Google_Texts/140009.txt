A Navarre teenager is dead after a two-car accident in Jackson County.

Florida Highway Patrol officials say 16-year-old Cherlynne Monno was driving south on U.S. Highway 231 near Rambo Rd. around 6:20 Sunday afternoon when her vehicle began to hydroplane.

FHP officials say her vehicle crossed the median into the northbound lanes of U.S. 231 in front of another vehicle's path.

A Dodge Ram 1500 struck the right side of Monno's Hynundai Tuscan.

FHP have confirmed that alcohol was not a factor in the collision. Traffic Homicide Investigators are taking over the case.

Law enforcement have notified Monno's family about the accident.
