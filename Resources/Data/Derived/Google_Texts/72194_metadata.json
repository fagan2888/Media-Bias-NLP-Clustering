Know your ideal goals for maximum profitability:\n\nA solid benchmark for revenue cycle effectiveness is by aiming to receive 98 percent of the collectable money.\n\nA good way to keep tabs on this efficacy is by monitoring the net collection ratio (NCR.)\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nThis NCR is measured by the difference between your charge and the payer\u2019s allowed amount. It\u2019s a key indicator of how much money is truly collectable, minus any contractual discounts that have already been negotiated.\n\n2. Become best friends with your key performance indicators\n\nAfter establishing profitability benchmarks for your organization, you\u2019ll be able to more easily determine what key performance indicators are most appropriate for your business. We recommend paying close attention to the following four revenue factors: gross collection ratio, net collection ratio, bad debt and bad debt ratio.\n\nWith these metrics consistently monitored, you\u2019ll be able to more quickly identify and correct signs of trouble before they become major issues. Create a monthly audit routine to compare your key performance indicators against accepted benchmarks.\n\n3. Be aware of current and upcoming policy changes most relevant to your business\n\nPay close attention to high-deductible insurance plans, which have gained rapid popularity and proven to be very disruptive within the healthcare marketplace. For many practices \u2018patient responsibility,\u2019 or self-pay, is soon going to be their number one payer, if it isn\u2019t already.\n\nCollecting from patients has always presented a hurdle, which will be further complicated by those patients who are not versed in insurance benefits and those with an inability or unwillingness to pay.\n\nPatient education of these new high-deductible, including most \u2018Obamacare\u2019 plans, will prove to be an increasing challenge for organizations of all sizes.\n\n4. Audit your denials and self-pay balances\n\nAs we mentioned, self-pay plans are going to demand an increasing amount of time from health care providers and revenue cycle managers.\n\nMark improvement by proactively keeping tabs on your denials and self-pay balances. These are the two most common areas in which health care providers leave money on the table.\n\nWhile seemingly time consuming, this is a critical aspect of revenue management and worth dedicating top resources and expertise towards converting denials to payment and collecting patient balances.\n\nIf a practice doesn\u2019t have the in-house resources to keep up with these tasks, there are a variety of outsourcing options available to organizations of all sizes.\n\nGiven that 2015 is a particularly tumultuous year for healthcare organizations, there are many outstanding questions about how ICD-10 and Medicare changes will impact client revenue. These concerns are as important as any of the recommended regular checkpoints.\n\nJames Larson is TCI Director of Revenue Cycle Management and Nancy Henry is Coding Manager.\n\nTwitter: @HFNewsTweet", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/blog/4-point-check-your-revenue-cycle-management", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Stethoscope-money-Feature_3.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "There are a few ways that practice managers and providers can easily perform a profitability check-up against best practice benchmarks.", "title": "A 4-point check-up for your revenue cycle management"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HC_Finance", "image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/Stethoscope-money-Feature_3.gif"}, "description": "There are a few ways that practice managers and providers can easily perform a profitability check-up against best practice benchmarks.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "A 4-point check-up for your revenue cycle management"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Just like focusing on providing quality care to patients is critical to a health care practice, bottom line management can make the difference between successful claims handling and a battle of denials and errors.&#13; Time and again we hear clients express frustration that collections are down, and more often than not it\u2019s due to time spent dealing with inefficiencies and mistakes in the back office.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "We recommend paying close attention to the following four revenue factors: gross collection ratio, net collection ratio, bad debt and bad debt ratio.\nBecome best friends with your key performance indicatorsAfter establishing profitability benchmarks for your organization, you\u2019ll be able to more easily determine what key performance indicators are most appropriate for your business.\nA good way to keep tabs on this efficacy is by monitoring the net collection ratio (NCR.)\nAudit your denials and self-pay balancesAs we mentioned, self-pay plans are going to demand an increasing amount of time from health care providers and revenue cycle managers.\nJames Larson is TCI Director of Revenue Cycle Management and Nancy Henry is Coding Manager."}
