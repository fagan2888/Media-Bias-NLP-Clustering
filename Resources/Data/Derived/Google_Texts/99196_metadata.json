Another Gallup poll found in September that 75 percent of Americans cited government corruption as a reason for distrust and disaffection with government, particularly in the light of IRS, Secret Service and Veterans Administration scandals.\n\nWhen questioned along political affiliation, nine out of 10 Republicans, or 88 percent, said big government is the biggest threat, far exceeding 67 percent of independents and 53 percent of Democrats who said the same.\n\nThose polled were not asked which branch of the government or who specifically in power caused the \u201cdissatisfaction.\u201d The poll, therefore, points to American exasperation with both President Obama and both chambers of Congress.\n\n65% of Americans approve of sending more ground troops to fight ISIS \u2013 poll https://t.co/NG7kxQE1zLpic.twitter.com/PqdpHbBVAi \u2014 RT America (@RT_America) November 19, 2015\n\nShrinking big government is a phrase often touted by Republicans, especially during political campaigns, even when the government is Republican-led as it was under the George W.
