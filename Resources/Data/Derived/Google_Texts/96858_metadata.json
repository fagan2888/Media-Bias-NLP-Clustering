The clip starts with at least one employee throwing a stack of cups at a woman in the busy restaurant. The footage has received more than 200,000 views on YouTube as of this writing, plus a substantial amount of traction on Facebook.\n\nSee the clip of the Five Guys brawl in Miami Beach embedded below.\n\nA Five Guys corporate representative indicated that the \u201cbeef in the burger store\u201d \u2014 as the New York Daily News quipped \u2014 is under investigation.\n\n\u201cThe video shows a trio of female employees dressed in Five Guys\u2019 red uniforms viciously punching the customer and pulling her hair inside the eatery packed with Halloween revelers. At one point, a man dressed as a security guard tries to intervene, but the eatery staffers continue beating the woman and yanking on her long black wig until they pull if off her head,\u201d the Daily Mail explained about the fast-food fracas.\n\n\u201cAccording to a witness, the woman was being loud and drunk, but didn\u2019t get physical,\u201d NBC Miami added.\n\nIt is yet to be undetermined what exactly prompted the altercation, however, at the Washington Avenue eatery.\n\nThe fast-growing Five Guys franchise chain has about 1,000 locations in the U.S. and Canada and in past surveys has been named as America\u2019s favorite burger joint.\n\nIn a statement, a Five Guys area supervisor declared that \u201cThe actions displayed in this video are simply unacceptable. We are working with the franchise owner to do a full investigation and ensure appropriate disciplinary actions are taken.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe customer who started this fight obviously doesn\u2019t appreciate the free peanuts that Five Guys offers,\u201d The Interrobang website joked.\n\nNo one called the Miami Beach cops on the 911 emergency line during the Halloween melee, however. \u201cSafety is our number one priority. As always, anyone who witnesses any sort of criminal activity or disturbance is urged to call police immediately,\u201d a Miami Beach police spokesman said.\n\nThat particular Five Guys outlet is open until 4 a.m. and gets a lot of traffic from the nearby clubs.\n\nAccording to the Miami Beach mayor, the Five Guys free-for-all is an example of why law and order needs to be restored in the commercial district.\n\n\u201cApparently, that area of Miami Beach is known as a problem area. Miami Beach Mayor Phillip Levine says there is a two-year plan already in place to help prevent disorder on Washington Avenue and Ocean Drive,\u201d News 10 of Tampa Bay/Sarasota reported.\n\nIn an unrelated alleged fast-food freakout, an apparently disgruntled Waffle House customer stands accused of shattering the front door of a restaurant over a 50-cent increase in the price of a sausage biscuit.\n\nParenthetically, a Five Guys multiple franchise owner indicated in 2013 that he might have to pass along price increases on burgers and fries in his restaurants to customers when the Obamacare employer mandate fully kicks in because insurance premiums will be the equivalent of \u201csupersized.\u201d\n\nApart from the Miami beef at Five Guys, do you think that violence at fast-food outlets is on the rise or is it just that cellphone video lets everyone know about it virtually immediately?\n\n[Photo courtesy of Michael Rivera via Wikimedia Commons|cropped and resized|(CC BY-SA 4.0)]", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three female Five Guys workers brawled with a female customer on Halloween night in newly surfaced cellphone video that has gone viral.
