Bickerstaff said. \u201cHe was dominant tonight.\u201d\n\nHoward felt the effects of getting a night off.\n\n\u201cI did feel pretty good tonight,\u201d Howard said. \u201cThe better shape I get in the better I\u2019ll be on the floor. I\u2019ll continue to work every day in practice to get in better shape.\u201d\n\nHouston has won seven in a row against the Kings.\n\nHoward also helped the Rockets by holding DeMarcus Cousins to 4-for-16 shooting. Cousins, who missed the first meeting with the Rockets because of an injury, was also hampered by foul trouble and finished with 14 points and nine rebounds. He fouled out with a little over two minutes left.\n\n\u201cI think the foul trouble bothered him from getting into a consistent type of rhythm,\u201d coach George Karl said.\n\nRudy Gay scored five consecutive points, putting Sacramento up by two with about five minutes left. Houston used an 8-2 run after that, highlighted by a 3-pointer by Trevor Ariza, to go up 109-105.\n\nHarden made a 3-pointer with about 90 seconds left to make it 115-109 and seal the win.\n\nBen McLemore scored 19 for the Kings.\n\n\u201cThey just answered all of our pushes,\u201d Gay said. \u201cWe thought we had something going and they came back and hit a three, got a dunk or a layup or a foul. We just can\u2019t win like that.\u201d\n\nThough Harden led the Rockets in scoring, he wasn\u2019t quite as dominant as he has been in recent meetings with the Kings. He entered the game averaging 41 points in the last four games against Sacramento, which included a career-high 51 points in April.\n\nHouston has won five of its last six games after opening the season 5-10.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re playing better, playing as a team,\u201d Harden said. \u201cDefensively we\u2019re playing really good.\u201d\n\nThe Rockets were down by one with about 7 1/2 minutes left when Harden drove into the lane and dished to Howard. But Howard\u2019s dunk try bounced off the rim and the Kings grabbed it.\n\nCousins made a pair of free throws on the other end to make it 98-95.\n\nThe Kings led by 3 before Ariza and Patrick Beverley made back to back 3-pointers to give Houston a 101-98 lead midway through the quarter. Harden blocked a shot by Darren Collison in between those baskets.\n\nA jump shot by Marco Belinelli gave the Kings an 85-84 lead entering the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Rockets led by as many as 15 early, but a 34-point second quarter by the Kings cut the lead to 52-50 at halftime.\n\nTIP-INS\n\nKings: Belinelli received a flagrant 1 foul when he pushed Corey Brewer to the court as he drove to the basket in the fourth quarter. \u2026 Collison had 18 points and Gay and Omri Casspi added 15 apiece.\n\nRockets: Harden made 14 of 16 free throws. \u2026 Houston assigned G/F K.J. McDaniels to the D-League on Friday. \u2026 Terrence Jones added 16 points and Ariza had 12.\n\nD-MO\u2019S RETURN: Houston\u2019s Donatas Motiejunas, who hasn\u2019t played since March, returned on Saturday night. The 7-footer has been out since surgery to repair a herniated disk and returned to practice earlier this week. Motiejunas drew a standing ovation when he entered the game for the first time with about 5 1/2 minutes left in the first quarter. He had one rebound and took a charge in about six minutes of play.\n\n\u201cIt was shocking,\u201d he said. \u201cEverything was so fast on the floor. It\u2019s going to take a little bit of time for me to get back into shape and get back in that position where I was last year. But I think it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d\n\nWITHOUT WILLIE: It was Sacramento\u2019s first game without rookie Willie Cauley-Stein, who suffered an open dislocation of his right index finger against Boston. The sixth overall pick in this year\u2019s draft is expected to miss four to six weeks.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nKings: Visit Oklahoma City on Tuesday.\n\nRockets: Visit Brooklyn on Tuesday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "While the Houston Rockets certainly don't like being without Dwight Howard when he sits out to rest, they love how he plays after he gets a break.", "Author": "KRISTIE RIEKEN", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "While the Houston Rockets certainly don\u2019t like being without Dwight Howard when he sits out to rest, they love how he plays after he gets a break.", "title": "Harden\u2019s 31 help Rockets over Kings 120-113", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/dec/5/hardens-31-help-rockets-over-kings-120-113/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/05/kings_rockets_basketball.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/12/05/kings_rockets_basketball.jpeg", "title": "Harden\u2019s 31 help Rockets over Kings 120-113", "description": "While the Houston Rockets certainly don't like being without Dwight Howard when he sits out to rest, they love how he plays after he gets a break.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "article_summary": "HOUSTON (AP) - While the Houston Rockets certainly don\u2019t like being without Dwight Howard when he sits out to rest, they love how he plays after he gets a break.\nRockets: Harden made 14 of 16 free throws.\nHoward had 22 points with 18 rebounds, James Harden added 31 points and the Rockets scored a season-high in a 120-113 win over the Sacramento Kings on Saturday night for their third straight win.\nHe fouled out with a little over two minutes left.\nRudy Gay scored five consecutive points, putting Sacramento up by two with about five minutes left."}
