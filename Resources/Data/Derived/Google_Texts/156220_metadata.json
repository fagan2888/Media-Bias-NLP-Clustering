She personally earned $11 million during that period for giving 50 speeches to banks and other industry groups.\n\nSanders and other critics say the public is entitled to know what she said in those speeches in private, to see whether they square with her current get-tough-with-Wall Street rhetoric and promises to rein in the worst excesses that might lead to another financial crisis.\n\nRelated: How the FBI Could Derail Hillary Clinton\u2019s Presidential Run\n\n\u201cPeople who want to know about my public record, it\u2019s there to see,\u201d Clinton said in the interview. \u201cPeople who want to know what I will do as president [can see]. Everybody says who have looked at it I have the best plan to rein in Wall Street to prevent them from ever doing what they did to us before. I want to move towards a level playing field. So, as I\u2019ve said, I\u2019m happy to do it [release transcripts of her private speeches] when everybody, including Republicans, does it.\u201d\n\nClinton is leading Sanders in the polls in South Carolina by as much as 50 points and she is likely to do well next week with strong support from African Americans in other southern states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Virginia and Tennessee.\n\nHowever, she once again finds herself in the uncomfortable positions of trying to hide documents that her foes are eager to expose and exploit for political gain. Throughout her yearlong campaign, Clinton and her lawyers have tangled with House GOP leaders, the inspector generals of the State Department and intelligence committee, the FBI and the courts to minimize the release of sensitive government emails that had been carefully controlled by Clinton on a private server while she was secretary of state.\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge ruled in a civil suit that State Department officials and top aides to Clinton should be questioned under oath about whether they intentionally sought to circumvent federal open records laws by using or allowing the use of a private email server throughout Clinton\u2019s four years as secretary of state between 2009 and 20013, as The Washington Post first reported. It is possible that Clinton will be called to testify before that suit brought by the conservative watchdog Judicial Watch is resolved.\n\nRelated: 18 Possible Picks for Hillary\u2019s Vice President\n\nNow there is the matter of Clinton\u2019s closed-door speeches to Wall Street and whether she should allow the public to see what she said to bankers before the election.\n\n\u201cThe real question underneath this is, \u2018Okay, you took money from Wall Street, can you regulate Wall Street?\u2019\u201d Clinton told MSNBC. \u201cWell, Barack Obama took more money from Wall Street than any candidate who has ever run for president, then turned around and passed the Dodd-Frank bill. So, I think you should be judged on what you\u2019ve done. I\u2019m more than happy to put my record against Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times editorial page, which generally has been supportive of Clinton in her increasingly combative campaign with Sanders, the democratic socialist Vermont senator, urged her to release the transcripts.\n\n\u201cPublic interest in these speeches is legitimate, and it is the public \u2013 not the candidate \u2013 who decides how much disclosure is enough,\u201d the editorial page declared. \u201cBy stonewalling on these transcripts Mrs. Clinton plays into the hands of those who say she\u2019s not trustworthy and makes her own rules. Most important, she is damaging her credibility among Democrats who are begging her to show them that she\u2019d run an accountable and transparent White House.\u201d\n\n\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton\u2019s 5 Big Privacy Issues (Before the Emails)\n\n\n\n\u201cI do not receive many millions of dollars from Wall Street or the pharmaceutical industry or other powerful, wealthy interests in this country, and have not given speeches for hundreds of thousands of dollars to Wall Street,\u201d Sanders said, according to The Washington Post.\n\nMeanwhile, a conservative super PAC linked to a number of top Republican donors will begin airing an ad on Saturday that attacks Clinton for refusing to release the transcript of those speeches, according to CNN. The ad, which is being financed by a group called Future45, will be aired through Super Tuesday next week.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton gave speeches to the biggest banks on Wall Street after one of the worst financial crises in American history,\" the narrator says along with video of someone who resembled Clinton opening a check from Goldman Sachs. \"But Hillary won't tell us what she said to those banks. They paid her over one million dollars and are contributing millions more to elect her.\"", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is feeling the heat from Democratic r", "title": "Clinton Is Under Mounting Pressure to Release Her Wall Street Speeches", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/26/Clinton-Under-Mounting-Pressure-Release-Her-Wall-Street-Speeches", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02162016_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/26/Clinton-Under-Mounting-Pressure-Release-Her-Wall-Street-Speeches", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/02162016_Hillary_Clinton.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is feeling the heat from Democratic r", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThe real question underneath this is, \u2018Okay, you took money from Wall Street, can you regulate Wall Street?\u2019\u201d Clinton told MSNBC.\n\u201cWell, Barack Obama took more money from Wall Street than any candidate who has ever run for president, then turned around and passed the Dodd-Frank bill.\nEverybody says who have looked at it I have the best plan to rein in Wall Street to prevent them from ever doing what they did to us before.\n\"Hillary Clinton gave speeches to the biggest banks on Wall Street after one of the worst financial crises in American history,\" the narrator says along with video of someone who resembled Clinton opening a check from Goldman Sachs.\nRelated: 18 Possible Picks for Hillary\u2019s Vice PresidentNow there is the matter of Clinton\u2019s closed-door speeches to Wall Street and whether she should allow the public to see what she said to bankers before the election."}
