For the 2014-15 school year the nation-wide Community Eligibility Program (CEP) allows high-poverty North Carolina schools to eliminate collecting school meal applications and offer breakfast and lunch to all of their students at no charge.\n\nOne in five American schoolchildren can\u2019t count on getting enough nutritious food at home, which can have a negative impact on a student\u2019s academic performance and development. Ensuring that children show up in classrooms each day fed and ready to learn increases the chances of students being more focused, attentive, and engaged.\n\nAt least 36 school systems across North Carolina have confirmed their plans to adopt CEP for the upcoming school year. (See map below) Some local school boards plan to adopt CEP district-wide while others will offer a universal meal program in selected schools within their district.\n\nA big kudos goes to these school systems that will adopt CEP next year. This serves as a positive step in helping ensure that all North Carolina students are afforded a high-quality, enriching education.\n\nA listing of all North Carolina school districts and individual schools that are eligible for community eligibility for the 2014-15 school year can be found via the NC Department of Public Instruction website.", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc6cb\"", "article_summary": "This serves as a positive step in helping ensure that all North Carolina students are afforded a high-quality, enriching education.\nAt least 36 school systems across North Carolina have confirmed their plans to adopt CEP for the upcoming school year.\nWith a new school year approaching, many local school boards across North Carolina will join an effort to help end childhood hunger.\nA listing of all North Carolina school districts and individual schools that are eligible for community eligibility for the 2014-15 school year can be found via the NC Department of Public Instruction website.\nA big kudos goes to these school systems that will adopt CEP next year."}
