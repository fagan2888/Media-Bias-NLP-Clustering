A Kansas agency doesn't yet have to release results of its internal investigation into the death of a 4-year-old northeast Kansas boy.

A federal judge's order for the Department for Children and Families to release an investigative report and other documents regarding the 2013 death is on hold.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Kenneth Gale stayed his earlier order following objections by the agency.

Naomi Boone had sued the department following the death of her son, 4-year-old Mekhi Boone. The child died in 2013 at the hands of his father, Lee Davis, who's serving nearly 20 years for second-degree murder. Boone contends the child shouldn't have been placed with his father.

The agency says the order to require the documents' release wasn't supported by case law.
