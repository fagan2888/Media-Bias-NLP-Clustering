The Affordable Care Act’s open-enrollment process got off to a genuinely awful start last year, and was, for a time, one of the biggest news stories in the country. For much of the political world, the two months of healthcare.gov troubles were “Obama’s Katrina,” Watergate, and the end of progressive governance, rolled up into a single package.

A year later, the great start to the open-enrollment process has largely been treated as an afterthought, though the successes are hard for anyone to deny.

More than 1 million people used the U.S. healthcare.gov system to sign up for Obamacare plans in the seven days ending Dec. 12, the best week yet for enrollment in the program’s second year. In total, 2.5 million Americans have signed up for health insurance plans since Nov. 15, when the online system opened for business, the government said today in a statement. The Obama administration’s goal for 2015 is to get 9.1 million paying customers in plans sold under the law. Of people who have enrolled so far using healthcare.gov, 52 percent already had coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and 48 percent were new customers.

To provide some additional context, last year, after three months, 2.2 million consumers had signed up for coverage through healthcare.gov. This year, after one month, it’s 2.5 million.

What’s more, this figure understates the national total because it doesn’t include Americans who’ve enrolled in state-based exchange marketplaces.

Charles Gaba, whose projections are eerily good – and have actually been slightly more accurate that HHS’s own figures on occasion – has revised his projections and believes total ACA enrollments should reach 12.5 million by the end of the open-enrollment period.

Even many “Obamacare” optimists didn’t expect to see this much success at this point.
