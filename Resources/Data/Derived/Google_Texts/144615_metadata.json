Mike Coffman isn't part of that Tea Party wing of the House GOP that's forced Speaker John Boehner to advance this reckless strategy; but he's not among the two dozen or so moderate House Republicans willing to criticize the tactics either.\n\nLast Thursday, he told FOX31 Denver that if the GOP's intransigence in October 2013 costs him his job in November 2014, that's a price he's willing to pay.\n\n\"Whatever the consequences of doing what\u2019s right in leadership are, I\u2019m willing to take those consequences,\" Coffman said.\n\nOn Monday, new poll numbers underline the real possibility that Coffman could pay that price.\n\nA separate poll released Monday evening by the Washington Post and ABC News shows national disapproval of congressional Republicans spiking to 70 percent, with 51 percent approving strongly.\n\nAccording to the other survey from Public Policy Polling, which examined 24 House races over the weekend, 47 percent of Coffman's constituents disapprove of his job performance while 41 percent approve.\n\nWhen asked if they'd vote for Coffman or a generic Democratic candidate next year (Andrew Romanoff is challenging Coffman but wasn't named by the polling outfit), Coffman is losing by a margin of 49-41 percent.\n\nAnd 62 percent of those polled \"oppose Congress shutting down major activities of the federal government as a way to stop the health care law from being put into place\", when that question was posed.\n\nSo, not surprisingly, Coffman's margin against a generic Democrat drops further to 51-41 percent when respondents were asked again: \"Now that you know Congressman Coffman supported the government shutdown, [sic] If the election for Congress were held today, would you vote for re-elect Republican Michael Coffman, or would you vote for his Democratic opponent?\"\n\nThe liberal group, MoveOn.org, paid for the 24 polls, 17 of which showed Republican congressmen falling behind in match-ups against generic Democrats next year.\n\nDemocrats need to gain 17 seats in the 2014 midterms to win back a majority in the House.\n\nMany of the Republicans polled by PPP, however, don't have serious opponents (Coffman's doesn't fall into that group); and many observers, including Roll Call's Stuart Rothenberg, recognize that the polls are more of an effort to pressure Republicans in the short term than a true gauge of next year's election.\n\n\"Every nonpartisan polling expert thinks this latest Democrat survey is a joke that's wildly off the mark,\" said Tyler Q. Houlton, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee.\n\n\"The fact is Andrew Romanoff would have sided with Washington Democrats and voted to shut down the government if given the chance, all in defense of Obama's failed health care law and reckless spending habits.\"", "article_metadata": {"description": "DENVER -- In Washington, DC, the conventional wisdom has long held that the Republican's House majority isn't going to be in play until 2022, after the next round of redistricting takes place.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "p": {"domain_verify": "5873d9988d745234e5abf9cff7ed939d"}, "og": {"site_name": "FOX31 Denver", "description": "DENVER \u2014 In Washington, DC, the conventional wisdom has long held that the Republican\u2019s House majority isn\u2019t going to be in play until 2022, after the next round of redistricting \u2026", "title": "Poll: shutdown hurting Coffman, House Republicans", "url": "http://kdvr.com/2013/10/07/poll-shutdown-hurting-coffman-house-republicans/", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/coffman.jpg", "height": 225}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://localtvkdvr.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/coffman.jpg?w=240", "site": "@kdvr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@kdvr"}, "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "msapplication-tooltip": "Denver, Colorado News, Weather, Sports and more", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=334627011", "fb": {"pages": 90018331599}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://kdvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/17e52d5bd05a36821dc7d1d5f90e105c?s=16", "application-name": "FOX31 Denver", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver", "published_time": "2013-10-07T20:30:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-08T01:13:38+00:00", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/fox31denver"}, "keywords": "politics,", "google-site-verification": "AmrqnQj74ngNWI1vn6WwMZyy9IWy4ZqooGuxLtd7lIs", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd97f6\"", "article_summary": "Rep.
