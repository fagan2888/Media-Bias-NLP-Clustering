What they\u2019ve actually turned up, however, is pathetic: Rubio\u2019s \u201cluxury\u201d (Read: fishing) boat, parking and traffic violations, and a less than optimal \u2018Scarlet Letter\u2019 law during Bush\u2019s tenure as governor which he eventually repealed. What it boils down to is that they\u2019ve got nothing on the GOP field and have become the brunt of jokes, even among leftist comedians. What\u2019s worse, the same New York Times that chided Rubio for his fiscal irresponsibility also endorsed Hillary in 2008\u2014right around the time its charity accepted money from her (they\u2019ve called the report \u201cpreposterous\u201d). Politico is trying to deflect criticisms about the Clintons\u2019 outrageous speaking fees by pointing out former President George W. Bush got paid a lot for speaking engagements, too. The big difference, of course, is that Bush isn\u2019t running for president and as Matt points out, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a nonprofit that\u2019s been labeled a \u201cslush fund.\u201d He hasn\u2019t approved arms deals after foreign governments have given to said fake, hypothetical Bush nonprofit, and both Laura and George of them were never in a position to approve certain foreign business deals that could have impacted national security policy (i.e. Uranium One deal) wherein speaking fees were involved.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, in other campaign and election news, New Hampshire Republicans penned a letter to Fox News asking them to change their proposed debate rules and the next day they did. The Iowa straw poll has been cancelled. And former Olympian/figure skating world champ Michelle Kwan joined Clinton\u2019s campaign staff. Clinton also joined Instagram, posting a photo of her red, white and blue pant suits with the caption \u201chard choices.\u201d\n\nPro-Life News\n\nNothing but good news for the pro-life movement this week: In Texas, a pro-life bill that has shuttered dozens of abortion clinics survived another challenge; Wisconsin moved to ban abortions after 20 weeks; Sen. Lindsey Graham also introduced a bill banning abortions five months into a pregnancy; and as a whole, abortions have declined in nearly every state since 2010. Even Obama said this week that \u201cevery human being, made in the image of God, deserves to live in dignity.\u201d Too bad he\u2019s the most pro-abortion president ever.\n\nOverseas, the rise of ISIS shows no signs of abating. The Iraqi military still in shambles and ISIS threatening the outskirts of Baghdad is a recipe for disaster. The terrorist group also reportedly has enough material to build a dirty bomb.\n\nSafety & Security\n\nObama said at the G7 summit that we need to train Iraqi forces faster and thwart ISIS\u2019s recruitment efforts, hence sending more U.S. troops over there to help with training. While here at home, the TSA fails to screen airport workers with ties to terrorism\u2014the latest in a series of damning findings about the agency. What will Congress do? And in Baltimore with violence sky high, Baltimore police officers are speaking out: The people wanted a soft police force and now they have one.\n\nJudges & Courts\n\nObama is not happy with the Supreme Court for taking up an Obamacare subsidy case, while conservatives\u2019 relationship with the court is, shall we say, complicated. Regarding police shootings, a judge in Cleveland found probable cause to charge the officers involved in the Tamir Rice shooting, and in South Carolina, the police who shot Walter Scott have been indicted on murder charges. A federal judge, meanwhile, would like to know the status of Lois Lerner\u2019s \u201clost\u201d emails. By the way, the GOP is finally looking to squeeze the IRS through proposed budget cuts.\n\nPolitical Correctness\n\nComedian Jerry Seinfeld has doubled down, slamming the level of political correctness in the country, and Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly wonders if Americans are sick of this PC nonsense. While we\u2019re on the subject, Townhall Media\u2019s Guy Benson and Mary Katharine Ham have a new book out, \u201cEnd of Discussion: How the Left\u2019s Outrage Industry Shuts Down Debate, Manipulates Voters, and Makes America Less Free (and Fun).\u201d In the book, which has chapters devoted to the policing of speech and the war on comedy, Benson and Ham \u201cexpose how the Left exploits fake outrage to silence their political opponents\u2014in public, on social media, at work, and even in their own homes.\u201d You should definitely check it out.\n\nThis Week\u2019s Absurdities\n\nThe stories are so varied we\u2019ll just go ahead and list them for you:\n\n-A little girl\u2019s lemonade stand was shut down\u2026in Texas because, you know, they needed a permit from the Health Department.\n\n-Children in Florida were taken away from their parents for a month for waiting alone (playing basketball) in backyard. The parents were stuck in traffic and the kids were alone for all of 90 minutes when a neighbor called the police on them. The parents now face criminal charges.\n\n-In a case of thought crime, a school principal was reassigned for defending a police officer on Facebook over how the officer handled a situation involving a group of rowdy teens at a pool party in McKinney, Texas.\n\n-The U.S. embassy in Indonesia is moving July 4 festivities up to accommodate Ramadan.\n\nGraphics by Townhall Graphic Designer Feven Amenu.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics..05/26/2016 0:39:05AM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - The Friday Filibuster: End of Discussion", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/06/12/the-friday-filibuster-n2011547", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/6/12/7.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - The Friday Filibuster: End of Discussion", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/leahbarkoukis/2015/06/12/the-friday-filibuster-n2011547", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2015/6/12/7.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "The Friday Filibuster: End of Discussion , Leah Barkoukis, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5c8a\"", "article_summary": "The Friday Filibuster: The one-stop-shop for everything you need to know about this week in politics.\n43%--the percentage of Americans who still believe TSA can stop terrorists at airports, despite the agency\u2019s serial failures.\n32.6% of HotAir readers would pick Sen.
