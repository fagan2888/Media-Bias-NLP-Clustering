No, we\u2019re not talking about the budding flowers or the chirping birds\u2014we\u2019re referring to those \u201cFor Sale\u201d signs that start popping up on lawns across the country as the weather starts heating up. And once the home-buying season commences \u2026 so do the bidding wars and mad dashes from one open house to another.\n\nSince the housing market can be a tricky one to suss out, we asked agents across the country to give us their assessments for this season\u2019s real estate landscape. Their overarching observation? This will be a competitive home-buying season\u2014so if you snooze, you may lose out on that four-bedroom colonial you\u2019ve been eyeing.\n\nRelated: When Home Remodeling Pays Off (or Not)\n\n\u201cThe major pitfall is lack of preparation,\u201d says David Yocum, a Redfin real estate agent based in Chicago. \u201cThe [housing] recovery appears slow due to a lack of inventory and a low participation rate among first-time buyers, but it\u2019s still a competitive seller\u2019s market.\u201d So check out our pros\u2019 tips for boosting your chances of success\u2014and possibly snagging that dream home by summer.\n\nSpring House-Hunting Tip #1: Close That Laptop\u2014and Canvass Old-Fashioned Open Houses\n\nThese days, using real estate sites to explore your options is par for the course: 90% of people search for listings online during their home-buying process. Kicking off your search online is a good move, but don\u2019t dawdle too long behind the computer screen\u2014inventory is expected to be tight in many major markets, so you literally want to hit the ground running.\n\n\u201cIn our market we hope for a burst of new inventory in the spring, but that doesn\u2019t always happen,\u201d says Richard Seaton, vice president at TTR Sotheby\u2019s International Realty in the Washington, D.C., area. \u201cEven if that burst comes, demand will outstrip supply, so buyers have to be in a position to make a decision quickly.\u201d\n\nPlus, what you view online may not necessarily reflect what you see when you pull up to the curb. \u201cBuyers should be careful,\u201d Seaton warns. \u201cThe Internet can tell only part of the story\u2014and it\u2019s usually the part the seller wants you to hear.\u201d\n\nRelated: Here's What You Could Have Saved on Home Heating This Winter\n\nThat\u2019s why Yocum recommends using your favorite real estate site as more of an alert than a decision-making tool by setting up instant updates for homes in desired neighborhoods so you can be notified of new inventory quickly\u2014and act quickly. \u201cYou need to be able to see the new homes the day they list, so you can be the first to see the home and make a quick decision,\u201d he says. \u201cFirst offers usually are successful offers.\u201d\n\nOne other factor to consider? If you live a warm state, you may want to kick things off early. According to data from Trulia, the hunt in sunnier locales is already heating up. Home searches in Cape Coral\u2013Fort Myers, Fla., for instance, were up 22% over the national average in January and February, while Tucson, Ariz., was up 11%.\n\nSpring House-Hunting Tip #2: Educate Yourself on Market Values and Trends\n\n\u201cBuyers need to get up to speed quickly on market values so they know the right decision when it presents itself,\u201d Yocum says. \u201cThe more quickly buyers can educate themselves, the more successful the home search will be.\u201d\n\nThis, of course, is where it\u2019s really all about location, location, location. According to the Case-Shiller 2014 home price index, San Francisco saw the largest annual regional gain at 9.3%, while other major markets\u2014like New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C.\u2014saw less than 2%.\n\nRelated: 3 Ways the Boomer Housing Crisis Benefits Millennials\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in full-blown rocket booster mode and it\u2019s great to be a seller,\u201d says Alexander Clark, a realtor with Paragon Real Estate Group who runs TheFrontSteps.com, a San Francisco real estate blog. \u201cPrices are through the roof\u2014and going higher with each property sold.\u201d\n\nOf course, one of the best sources of insider information is a well-connected real estate agent. But Seaton also suggests checking out sites like Curbed.com for trends in your desired area and to find where new inventory may soon be popping up. Be aware, too, that there could be microtrends in your region that could impact local prices. For example, maybe new homes run at a premium to older ones, or the demand for townhomes and condos outpaces single family homes in your market.\n\nSpring House-Hunting Tip #3: Nab Low Mortgage Rates\u2014Now\n\nAnother reason not to dawdle too long? You want to take advantage of low interest rates while they last. \u201cMortgage rates are still historically low, allowing buyers to wrap up the most house their money will afford them at payment levels that should be affordable for decades,\u201d Yocum says.\n\nIn fact, interest rates are so low that, in many markets, monthly mortgage payments are less than rent, adds Seaton. \u201cMost predictions are that the fabulously low interest rates will stay that way through the spring, and that the variety of loan packages available to buyers will continue to multiply,\u201d he adds.\n\nHouse hunters also got another boost recently: In January the Federal Housing Authority, which backs loans for borrowers who make low down payments, lowered the annual insurance premium it requires from 1.35% of a home loan to just 0.85%. The Housing Department estimates this will save more than 2 million FHA homeowners about $900 a year.\n\nRelated: Two Housing Markets for the Two Americas\n\nBottom line: It\u2019s a prime time to jump on a home loan. After all, mortgage rates can be unpredictable\u2014and a decision by the Fed to raise interest rates mid-year, as many economists predict, could cause them to climb.\n\nSpring House-Hunting Tip #4: Build Your Home-Buying Dream Team Before You Bid\n\nIf spring-cleaning season has you in a hyper-organized mood, channel some of that spirit into your house hunting\u2014in order to be a serious frontrunner in a bidding war, you\u2019ll need to have all of your ducks in a row. So not only will you need a savvy real estate agent, but you\u2019ll also want your lender, inspector and attorney at the ready so you can act fast, says Yocum.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget completing your mortgage application and having your loan amount determined in advance. \u201cWe move at breakneck speed in San Francisco,\u201d Clark adds. \u201cAll of my clients must absolutely be 100% pre-approved before submitting an offer.\u201d\n\nSeaton suggests even taking it a step further. \u201cTo make themselves more competitive, the most successful buyers are going beyond the pre-approval process to become fully approved prior to purchasing,\u201d he says. \u201cNot all lenders offer this possibility, but some do.\u201d And the better known your lender is locally, the more likely you\u2019ll win the confidence of the seller. \u201cNo real estate agent wants to recommend that his client accept an offer from a buyer who dug up a lender on the Internet,\u201d he adds.\n\nRelated: 7 Most Overvalued Housing Markets in the Country\n\nFor a seal-the-deal final touch, Yocum suggests drafting a template of the personal letter you\u2019d send to the sellers of a home explaining how much you love their house and why you want it. \u201cThen, when you find the right home, you can drop in the address, sellers\u2019 names and specifics about the home,\u201d he says. \u201cSellers always respond positively to a personal letter, and if buyers are competing, it might be the deciding factor.\u201d\n\nSpring House-Hunting Tip #5: Keep Sweeten-the-Deal Moves in Mind\n\nSo you\u2019ve finally found that dream Tudor on a half-acre\u2014but you\u2019re stuck in a bidding war with another equally prepared buyer. How do you win by a nose? For one, include an escalation clause, along with your offer, suggests Seaton. This is an amount that you\u2019d automatically be willing to pay above a competing bid.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say you add an escalation clause of $3,000 to your bid of $200,000. If a second offer comes in at $205,000, your bid would get bumped to $208,000. If you\u2019re in a hot market, a significant escalation factor could really pique seller interest, Seaton adds.\n\nYocum also suggests seeing if there are contingency clauses you\u2019re willing to forego in your real estate contract. Contingencies are terms of a contract that must be met or the buyer or seller can walk away from the deal; home inspection, appraisal and financing contingencies are among the most common.\n\nRelated: Obama's Housing Programs Still More Hype Than Help\n\nTo be sure, \u201call of these have various levels of risk that not all buyers are willing to accept, and you should consult with your team before [removing] any of them,\u201d he cautions. After all, you want to protect your earnest money if you suddenly realize your dream home has termites, or an appraiser discovers you\u2019re paying far more than market value.\n\nThat said, doing due diligence prep work can help you feel better about removing contingencies. For instance, getting fully approved for a mortgage can help you remove the financing contingency, says Seaton. \u201cAnd absolutely conduct a pre-inspection prior to making an offer, so that you do not need a home inspection contingency in the offer,\u201d he adds.\n\nThere are also smaller carrots you can offer, such as finding out when the seller prefers to close and using that closing date in your contract, says Yocum. Or close as quickly as possible and offer to accept rent payments from the sellers, adds Clark.\n\nAll these perks can add up to much more than you think. Seaton, for instance, represented a seller earlier this year who ultimately went with a lower bid because the offer had no contingencies. \u201cWe see this very often,\u201d he says. \u201cMany sellers prefer no risk to a few more dollars.\u201d\n\nUltimately, what all the advice boils down to is making sure you don\u2019t get caught unprepared when that perfect property is finally up for grabs. \u201cThe name of the game,\u201d Seaton says, \u201cis very much figure out what you want; get your financing straightened; and when the right property comes along, be ready to pounce\u2014and quickly.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in LearnVest.\n\n\n\nRead more at LearnVest:\n\nWhich Colleges Produce the Best Paid Grads\n\n21 Favors You Can Ask of Career Contacts\n\n5 Traits Tomorrow's Millionaires Possess", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Spring and all its glory is right around the corner\u2014just take a look at the signs all", "title": "5 Ways to Find Your Dream Home This Spring", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/09/5-Ways-Find-Your-Dream-Home-Spring", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04252011_home_sale_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/09/5-Ways-Find-Your-Dream-Home-Spring", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/04252011_home_sale_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "Spring and all its glory is right around the corner\u2014just take a look at the signs all", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd19df\"", "article_summary": "Spring House-Hunting Tip #1: Close That Laptop\u2014and Canvass Old-Fashioned Open HousesThese days, using real estate sites to explore your options is par for the course: 90% of people search for listings online during their home-buying process.\n\u201cPrices are through the roof\u2014and going higher with each property sold.\u201dOf course, one of the best sources of insider information is a well-connected real estate agent.\nRelated: When Home Remodeling Pays Off (or Not)\u201cThe major pitfall is lack of preparation,\u201d says David Yocum, a Redfin real estate agent based in Chicago.\nSpring and all its glory is right around the corner\u2014just take a look at the signs all around you.\nYocum also suggests seeing if there are contingency clauses you\u2019re willing to forego in your real estate contract."}
