He looked down. He saw blood.\n\nThe veteran left-hander threw through a cut middle finger on his pitching hand last week. But the cut on Tuesday forced the Rockies to scratch De La Rosa from his scheduled start against the Reds at Great American Ballpark.\n\nColorado recalled Chris Rusin from Triple-A Albuquerque to start in De La Rosa\u2019s place. The Rockies sent down long reliever Yohan Flande to Triple-A Albuquerque to make room for Rusin.\n\nDe La Rosa, instead, will start Saturday at Philadelphia. That will bump Jordan Lyles off his scheduled next start. Lyles, who\u2019s dealing with a toe injury, will likely not start until at least Sunday, manager Walt Weiss said, if not later.\n\nAgainst the Phillies on Thursday, De La Rosa cut his left middle finger on the seam of a baseball while throwing warm-ups before the game. He pitched through the cut in an uneven outing, but he avoided the disabled list.\n\nWATCH: Trending Now: Jorge De La Rosa out with cut finger\n\n\u201cI felt something wet. It was blood,\u201d De La Rosa said. \u201cIt was hard. You saw the game. I didn\u2019t have command.\u201d\n\nHe pitched 4 1/3 innings for a no-decision against the Phillies. But he struck out five to reach 774 career strikeouts for the Rockies, passing Ubaldo Jimenez for the club record. The Rockies won the game 7-3.\n\nDe La Rosa had some of the skin around the cut shaved to allow it to heal. He threw on flat ground Tuesday and said his finger was sore and tender, but he otherwise had no difficulties.\n\n\u201cWe felt like he needed a few more days,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe wanted to see how the cut healed.\u201d\n\nWith Lyles, who left Saturday\u2019s game in the fourth inning with a sprained toe on his left foot, the Rockies are not likely to put him on the DL, Weiss said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still monitoring him,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cBut he may be in the same boat, where we make an adjustment to his next start. We\u2019re not overly concerned.\u201d\n\nRusin, who was called up from Albuquerque on May 6 as the 26th man for the second game of a doubleheader against the Giants, never appeared. He was claimed off waivers from the Cubs in September.\n\nWith the Isotopes, Rusin is 3-2 with a 6.29 ERA in six starts and one relief appearance. With the Cubs, Rusin has some experience pitching against the Reds.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jorge De La Rosa scratched from Rockies start with cut; Chris Rusin called up", "title": "Jorge De La Rosa scratched from Rockies start with cut; Chris Rusin called up", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/26/jorge-de-la-rosa-scratched-from-rockies-start-with-cut-chris-rusin-called-up/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150521_042408_jorge-de-la-rosa.jpg", "height": 415}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150521_042408_jorge-de-la-rosa.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-26T13:40:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-23T04:48:19+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "But the cut on Tuesday forced the Rockies to scratch De La Rosa from his scheduled start against the Reds at Great American Ballpark.\nCINCINNATI \u2014 Jorge De La Rosa felt something wet.\nWATCH: Trending Now: Jorge De La Rosa out with cut finger\u201cI felt something wet.\nDe La Rosa had some of the skin around the cut shaved to allow it to heal.\nAgainst the Phillies on Thursday, De La Rosa cut his left middle finger on the seam of a baseball while throwing warm-ups before the game."}
