Monday Memories: Organized labor fights for foothold\n\nIn the summer of 1937 the nation\u2019s attention turned to a strike at Newton Steel Company in Monroe. Monroe had 18,000 residents, and 1,350 of them worked at Newton Steel.\n\nWhen a May 26, 1937, deadline for a contract with the three firms passed, the Congress of Industrial Organizations called for a steel workers strike. Picket lines went up in Monroe on May 28. The strike resulted in the walkout of about 120 plant workers who supported unionization. Another 800 employees did not want to strike and were members of a company \u201cunion\u201d created by Republic Steel as a counter-maneuver to CIO organizing efforts. Republic Steel shut the plant down, fearing violence. READ MORE\n\n\n\nTHE BLADE/AMY E.

Obamacare transforms medical industry\n\nMost agree that the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, has fundamentally changed the health insurance landscape in the United States, but the health-care law is also quietly causing a sea change in the way hospitals and doctors treat patients and do business.\n\n\u201cThe entire industry is really doing a paradigm shift,\u201d said Terri Thompson, vice president of population health for ProMedica.\n\nLeaders at ProMedica and Mercy health systems, the two largest health providers in the Toledo area, are moving away from what they call an outdated model, where doctors get paid for each service provided, to a new one that is broadly known as population health management.

Excitement fades quickly after headliner a no-show at Perrysburg hip hop concert\n\nIt was a case of disappearing acts at Saturday\u2018\u200ds OG Hip Hop Concert and BBQ at the Perrysburg Community Center, where headliners didn\u2019\u200dt show and local acts pulled out at the last minute.\n\nHeadliner Coolio was said to have suffered an asthma attack hours before he was scheduled to perform. Jason Craig, director of operations for the center, said he didn't expect the rapper, famous for his 1995 hit \u201cGangsta\u2019\u200ds Paradise,\u201d to go on.\n\nThe show, which ran from noon to 11 p.m. was carried by more than two dozen local acts, including rappers and singers, who performed across four stages.

Carter decries global abuse against women\n\nWorldwide abuse of women and girls is \u201cthe most terrible human-rights violation on Earth,\u201d and the United States is not immune, former President Jimmy Carter said Saturday during an address to the convention of the Islamic Society of North America.\n\nAmong the grave statistics Mr. Carter cited during his speech before an audience of more than 3,000 in Cobo Hall is the routine strangulation of infant daughters, particularly in poor countries because poverty impels some families to desire sons for economic support when the parents grow old.\n\n\u201cAt this moment, now missing from the face of the Earth are about 160 million girls because their parents strangled their daughters at birth,\u201d Mr. Carter said.

Area shooting range owners shocked by gun tragedy\n\nThe tragic accident this week at an Arizona shooting range, where an instructor was killed while showing a 9-year-old girl how to fire an Uzi, left range operators in the Toledo area stunned, saddened, and questioning how such a troubling incident could even happen.\n\nMost ranges in northwest Ohio and southeast Michigan prohibit the use of fully automatic firearms, and have strict regulations concerning children using the range.\n\n\u201cYour first reaction is shock when you hear about such a sad, sad thing, because shooting ranges are always supposed to be about safety first,\u201d said Keith Helminski, who runs Shooters of Maumee, a public range that opened about two years ago.\n\n\u201cThese shooting ranges aren\u2019t the wild, wild West, and that\u2019s not the protocol for anyone around here. Giving a child that young, with no experience, that kind of firearm ... that\u2019s like taking a 9-year-old who has obviously never ridden a motorcycle before and putting them on a Harley-Davidson \u2014 you know what the end result is going to be.\u201d READ MORE", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.toledoblade.com/image/2014/09/01/75x_b1_a4-4_cC_z/NEWTON-STEEL-1.jpg", "sailthru.author": "blade staff", "description": "1.
