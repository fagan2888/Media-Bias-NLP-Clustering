J.W. Childs Follows Wine Deal with Cycle Gear Acquisition

The PE firm purchased the motorcycle apparel company one day after investing in Kosta Browne Winery

Boston private equity firm J.W. Childs Associates LP has acquired Cycle Gear, one day after investing in a California winery.

Cycle Gear, headquartered in Benicia, California, provides motorcycle apparel, parts and accessories. The company operates 112 stores in 34 states, has an online business and distributes catalogs. The company has been backed by New York private equity firm Harvest Partners LP since 2005. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

On Jan. 7, J.W. Childs announced it invested in Kosta Browne Winery, which is in line with our expectations for more wine and spirits deals in 2015. The firm has invested more than $3 billion in equity in more than 40 consumer, specialty retail and health care businesses since it was founded in 1995.

Lifestyle brands have long attracted interest from private equity firms. Earlier in January, Bregal Partners added deer-lure brand Tink's to portfolio Arcus Hunting, and J.H. Whitney Capital Partners-backed Confluence Ourdoor acquired Boardworks, a paddle board company.
