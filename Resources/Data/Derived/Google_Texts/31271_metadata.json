But smug conservatives are getting ridiculous about this:\n\nSecond, believe it or not, the existence of great websites is sort of incidental to the operation of a social insurance system. Social Security and Medicare, for example, both have good websites in 2013. But both programs functioned fine for decades without any kind of website at all. Universal health care systems were built all around the world before the Internet existed. The reason the Affordable Care Act is supposed to feature great websites is because the Internet exists in 2013, so we expect things to have websites, but it's not like the underlying idea of bringing a Bismarkian health insurance system to the United States depends in some conceptual way on the website. Bismark did it in 1883! They've added a prominent \"apply by phone\" tab to HealthCare.gov for just this reason.", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "HealthCare.gov's Problems Don't Discredit Liberalism", "sailthru.author": "Matthew Yglesias", "description": "The problems with HealthCare.gov are a substantial practical problem for the Affordable Care Act and should be a real source of shame for the Obama adm ...", "og": {"site_name": "Slate Magazine", "description": "The problems with HealthCare.gov are a substantial practical problem for the Affordable Care Act and should be a real source of shame for the Obama adm ...", "title": "HealthCare.gov's Problems Don't Discredit Liberalism", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/10/21/healthcare_gov_and_liberalism_it_s_fine.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2013/10/21/healthcare_gov_and_liberalism_it_s_fine/1382367112.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The problems with HealthCare.gov are a substantial practical problem for the Affordable Care Act and should be a real source of shame for the Obama adm ...", "title": "HealthCare.gov's Problems Don't Discredit Liberalism", "url": "http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/10/21/healthcare_gov_and_liberalism_it_s_fine.html", "image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2013/10/21/healthcare_gov_and_liberalism_it_s_fine/1382367112.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "creator": "@mattyglesias", "site": "@slate", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2013-10-21T10:52:00Z", "sailthru.promoheadline": "HealthCare.gov's Problems Don't Discredit Liberalism", "sailthru.headline": "HealthCare.gov's Problems Don't Discredit Liberalism", "parsely-page": "{\n  \"title\": \"HealthCare.gov\\u0027s Problems Don\\u0027t Discredit Liberalism\",\n  \"link\": \"http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/10/21/healthcare_gov_and_liberalism_it_s_fine.html\",\n  \"image_url\": \"http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2013/10/21/healthcare_gov_and_liberalism_it_s_fine/1382367112.jpg.CROP.thumbnail-small.jpg\",\n  \"type\": \"post\",\n  \"post_id\": \"221131021002\",\n  \"pub_date\": \"2013-10-21T10:52:00Z\",\n  \"section\": \"Business\",\n  \"author\": \"Matthew Yglesias\",\n  \"tags\": [\"obamacare\"]\n}", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "tw-line": "HealthCare.gov's Problems Don't Discredit Liberalism", "keywords": "patrick ruffini, healthcare.gov, problems with obamacare website, problems with healthcare.gov, healthcare.gov not working, obamacare website not working", "google-site-verification": "jXqoqqPSmx_PWchRdG-IXu-X616Ee2Ptf_AiElI9LzQ", "sailthru.tags": "patrick ruffini, healthcare.gov, problems with obamacare website, problems with healthcare.gov, healthcare.gov not working, obamacare website not working", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/Slate", "author": "http://www.Facebook.com/mattyglesias"}, "sailthru.description": "The problems with HealthCare.gov are a substantial practical problem for the Affordable Care Act and should be a real source of shame for the Obama adm ...", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/moneybox/2013/10/21/healthcare_gov_and_liberalism_it_s_fine/1382367112.jpg.CROP.cq5dam_web_1280_1280_jpeg.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda2bd\"", "article_summary": "They've added a prominent \"apply by phone\" tab to HealthCare.gov for just this reason.\nBut smug conservatives are getting ridiculous about this:Second, believe it or not, the existence of great websites is sort of incidental to the operation of a social insurance system.\nUniversal health care systems were built all around the world before the Internet existed.\nThe problems with HealthCare.gov are a substantial practical problem for the Affordable Care Act and should be a real source of shame for the Obama administration, which appears to have massively screwed this up.\nSocial Security and Medicare, for example, both have good websites in 2013."}
