That\u2019s significantly more than the percent of non-Hispanic Asians and non-Hispanic whites who were uninsured:\n\n\n\nCREDIT: CDC\n\nThe report finds disparities in other areas of health, too. For example, Hispanic and African-American individuals were more likely than white individuals \u201cto have failed to obtain needed medical care due to cost.\u201d And Hispanics and African-Americans were more than 10 percent less likely to be in \u201cexcellent or very good health.\u201d\n\nThe ACA includes important provisions to decrease those health disparities. However, some issues remain. For one thing, the refusal of some states to accept the law\u2019s optional Medicaid expansion has set back this progress significantly and will continue to do so until states reverse course.\n\nA recent Kaiser Family Foundation study revealed that 2.5 million persons of color fall into the coverage gap in 27 states that chose not to expand Medicaid. These are individuals who don\u2019t qualify for their states\u2019 current Medicaid programs, but are below the income level necessary to qualify for subsidies to purchase private insurance on the exchanges. Poor uninsured Black adults in the South are particularly affected by the resistance to Medicaid expansion.\n\nRacial disparities have emerged among the people who signed up for private plans, too. Although over 8 million Americans successfully enrolled in Obamacare\u2019s first open enrollment period, some communities were reached less effectively than others. Data released by the Department of Health and Human Services shows the enrollment pool, among those who reported race or ethnicity, consisted of 63 percent Whites, 17 percent African Americans, 11 percent Latinos, and 8 percent Asians. That\u2019s not representative of the overall uninsured population. Of the 47 million people who were uninsured in 2012, 45 percent were White, 32 percent were Hispanic, 15 percent were Black, and 5 percent were Asian-American/Pacific Islander.\n\nThat\u2019s partly because enrollment efforts underperformed in Latino communities. For instance, California struggled to enroll Latino individuals at a proportionate rate, with Latinos making up just 22 percent of enrollment even though they\u2019re 57 percent of California\u2019s uninsured population. The numbers reveal the importance of effective Spanish-language outreach, particularly because there were some concerns that the HealthCare.gov site was relying on poor Spanish translations.\n\nEliminating racial disparities is crucial, since studies show that health insurance can improve financial security and save lives. Plus, it can help save money by reducing unnecessary costs and inefficiencies. A 2009 study found that \u201celiminating health disparities for minorities would have reduced direct medical care expenditures by $229.4 billion for the years 2003-2006.\u201d\n\nWhile the overall enrollment numbers in the exchanges and state Medicaid programs were encouraging, these racial disparities deserve more attention and haven\u2019t received sufficient consideration from policymakers at the national or local level. There are a couple things that we could start doing. More data could be collected to fill in missing information gaps about non-white communities. Every state could agree to expand its Medicaid program. And we could work to improve outreach in communities speaking other languages, especially Spanish, going into the ACA\u2019s second open enrollment period this November.\n\nVignesh Krishnaswamy is a health policy intern at the Center for American Progress.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "There are still significant racial disparities in the health care gains made possible by the Affordable Care Act.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "There are still significant racial disparities in the health care gains made possible by the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "People Of Color Aren\u2019t Benefiting From Obamacare As Much As They Could Be", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/07/02/3455738/obamacare-racial-disparities/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/aca.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/aca-321x214.jpg", "title": "People Of Color Aren\u2019t Benefiting From Obamacare As Much As They Could Be", "description": "There are still significant racial disparities in the health care gains made possible by the Affordable Care Act.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ThinkProgress"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-health", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/aca.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/aca.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-07-02T10:53:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd10bc\"", "article_summary": "Racial disparities have emerged among the people who signed up for private plans, too.\nHealth People Of Color Aren\u2019t Benefiting From Obamacare As Much As They Could Be CREDIT: AP Photo/Charles DharapakEven as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) enables millions of uninsured people to gain coverage, a new survey shows that stark racial disparities in health insurance coverage remain a serious problem.\nEliminating racial disparities is crucial, since studies show that health insurance can improve financial security and save lives.\nA recent Kaiser Family Foundation study revealed that 2.5 million persons of color fall into the coverage gap in 27 states that chose not to expand Medicaid.\nAlthough over 8 million Americans successfully enrolled in Obamacare\u2019s first open enrollment period, some communities were reached less effectively than others."}
