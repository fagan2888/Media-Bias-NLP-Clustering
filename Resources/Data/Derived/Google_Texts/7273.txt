Bondara, a British sex toy company, is working to boost your sex life with their new kind of activity tracker.

Talk about good vibrations. Bondara, an adult toy company based in the UK, announced they’re working on a prototype for an activity tracker and sex toy called SexFit.

“Our device is a natural next step alongside the influx of personal health trackers and with the added benefit of improving an individual’s sex life, we expect it to be a huge hit when it becomes,” Louise Bagley, a sex toys buyer for Bondara, said in a press release.

SexFit is exactly what it sounds like: a tracker men wear at the base of their penis during sex to transmit calories burned and thrusts per minute to a free app via Bluetooth. Then, if they're so inclined, they can share their "workout" with their social media followers. The tracker very much works like a penis ring in that it also vibrates to stimulate a better erection (and overall better sex), and lights up to notify the wearer they’ve hit the jackpot. Er, a steady rhythm.

Should this prototype not make it to the market, men still have fitness program Private Gym For Men. While this is a step up from an app, Private Gym comes with a weighted penis ring that helps men strengthen their pelvic muscles. And as you know, a stronger pelvic floor, makes for a stronger orgasm.
