Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell was in Jacksonville Friday to visit the site where hundreds of people are expected to sign up for the Affordable Care Act during open enrollment.

Burwell said more than 1 million Floridians have already signed up for a health care plan.

“Ten million fewer adults are uninsured this year than they were in 2013,” Burwell said.

Many are already signing up on healthcare.gov, a website that was plagued with errors when it was first rolled out. Burwell said the issues have been fixed and the process is easier.

“For those new consumers who are signing up for the first time, 70 percent of those folks can use an application that went from 76 screens to 16 screens,” Burwell said.

Laura Gonzalez said she’s already benefiting from health care.

“I’m paying $41 a month for my health insurance for a family of four,” Gonzalez said.

If you don’t sign up, you are looking at a penalty that goes up every year that you’re not covered.

“Those penalties will be $325 or 2 percent of your taxable income, whichever is higher,” Burwell said.

That money would be taken out of your federal income tax refund.

If you don’t pay the fee, the IRS will hold back the amount of the fee from any future tax refunds, but there are no liens, levies or criminal penalties for not paying.

The deadline for open enrollment is February 15.
