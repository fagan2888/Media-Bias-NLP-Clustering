As part of ongoing efforts in the area of telemedicine, CVS Health has teamed up with three major telehealth companies—American Well, Doctor On Demand and Teladoc—to “explore how direct-to-consumer telehealth providers, retail pharmacy and retail clinic providers” can collaborate in this rapidly growing area of technology.

“With the increased demand for patient care anticipated in future years as a result of the expansion of coverage through the Affordable Care Act, the primary care physician shortage, aging of the population and epidemic of chronic disease, telehealth gives us the opportunity to offer high quality care to an expanded group of patients in a variety of convenient and cost-effective locations,” said Andrew Sussman, M.D., executive vice president/associate chief medical officer of CVS Health and president of MinuteClinic, in a written statement.
