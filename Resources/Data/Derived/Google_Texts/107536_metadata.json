Both games featured heavy wet snow blowing sideways because of the wind. An orange ball was used both times.\n\nDU took a 3-0 lead against the black-and-red clad St. John\u2019s \u2014 aptly named the Red Storm \u2014 and never trailed. The Pioneers led 5-1 after the first quarter, 9-3 at halftime and 15-7 after three quarters. St. John\u2019s fell to 1-10, 0-3.\n\n\u201cThe game was a microcosm of our season,\u201d DU coach Bill Tierney said. \u201cWe did some really amazing things. Trevor and Connor obviously both played great. And then we were a disaster at times. Up and down, frustrating. We scored a little too easily early, and when that happens 18-year-olds start to think it\u2019s going to be easy.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWe came out of last week\u2019s game in the snow just congratulating them. It was hard work. Tough game, just pure effort. It was much worse than today. Today I just thought we were a little bit up and down.\u201d\n\nDenver\u2019s 15 turnovers and 10 goals allowed are both too many. But Tierney praised St. John\u2019s attack Eric DeJohn, who had a game-high six points on five goals. He also had a game-high 10 shots on goal.\n\n\u201cI give the kid, DeJohn, a lot of credit. But I\u2019m not sure we played great defense around him at times \u2014 especially in the second half,\u201d Tierney said.\n\nDU junior midfielder Zach Miller, who is the team\u2019s third-leading scorer with 29 points, was held pointless for the first time in 48 games. His 47-game points streak was the third longest in the country.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to get his points and they\u2019ll come in bunches, Cannizzaro said of Miller. \u201cIt was a cold game. He was freezing. No one likes the cold weather, but he\u2019s one of the best players on our team and I can\u2019t say enough about him.\u201d\n\nIn making up for Miller\u2019s offensive struggles, freshman midfielder Colton Jackson had three goals, and sophomores Connor Donahue and Brendan Bomberry had a combined seven points. Donahue, who started at attack, had two goals and an assist and midfielder Bomberry had a goal and three assists.\n\nEleven of Denver\u2019s 17 goals came off assists \u2014 including four by starting middie Tyler Pace. At the other end, Pioneers freshman goalie Alex Ready had 11 saves before giving way to backup Hunter Krout. Denver played most of its reserves in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Pioneers, who played their previous three games outside Colorado, go back on the road for this Saturday\u2019s game at Providence before hosting Marquette in the regular-season finale April 30.\n\nDU hosts the Big East Championship May 5 and 7 before the NCAA Tournament begins May 14 at the top eight seeds.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or Twitter: @MikeChambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "DU men\u2019s lacrosse team weathers snowstorm, dominates St. John\u2019s", "title": "DU men\u2019s lacrosse team weathers snowstorm, dominates St. John\u2019s", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/16/du-mens-lacrosse-team-weathers-snowstorm-dominates-st-johns/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-16T15:46:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-16T15:46:16+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "University of Denver"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b3b\"", "article_summary": "DU took a 3-0 lead against the black-and-red clad St. John\u2019s \u2014 aptly named the Red Storm \u2014 and never trailed.\nBut Tierney praised St. John\u2019s attack Eric DeJohn, who had a game-high six points on five goals.\nSt. John\u2019s fell to 1-10, 0-3.\nDonahue, who started at attack, had two goals and an assist and midfielder Bomberry had a goal and three assists.\nThe third-ranked Pioneers (10-1, 3-0) battled through a similar snowstorm the previous Saturday to win 12-11 at Villanova."}
