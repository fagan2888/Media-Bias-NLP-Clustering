Democrats want the government to restrict the right of self-defense, even if it means considering the confiscation of guns. Republicans want the government to control who may come to the country, even if it means compelling employers to clear job applicants through a national database.\n\nLet that sink in. Two of the most important aspects of liberty are self-defense and the search for a better life. One political party would have the state dictate the terms of the first; the other would have the government dictate the terms of the second.\n\nI ask again: what's a liberty lover to do?\n\nThe right to take self-defensive action follows from self-ownership, which means the right not to be aggressed against and the obligation not to aggress against others. As the Levelller Richard Overton wrote in \"An Arrow against All Tyrants\" (1646):\n\nTo every individual in nature is given an individual property by nature not to be invaded or usurped by any. For every one, as he is himself, so he has a self-propriety, else could he not be himself; and of this no second may presume to deprive any of without manifest violation and affront to the very principles of nature and of the rules of equity and justice between man and man.\n\nAbraham Lincoln said, \"If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.\" That is intuitively true; that is, we grasp it directly, as we grasp that the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. Slavery is wrong, and slavery is the negation of self-ownership. The abolitionists called slaveholders \"man-stealers.\" So if it is true that slavery is wrong, this must also be true: if self-ownership is not right, nothing is right.\n\nYou cannot believe that your life is your own without also believing that you are entitled to defend yourself from physical attack, even if deadly force is required. Further, if self-defense is legitimate, then the acquisition of the means of self-defense, such as a handgun, rifle, or shotgun, is also legitimate. No one else's right of self-ownership is violated by the mere acquisition or possession of firearms.\n\nThus the right not to be aggressed against\u2014to self-ownership\u2014entails the right of self-defense, which entails the right to acquire (through consensual means of course) firearms. Forcibly encumbering people's efforts to acquire and possess firearms\u2014most particularly government gun control in all its splendid variety\u2014violates their rights.\n\nYet most Democrats see no problem in encumbering those efforts. The term gun control has a bad sound these days, so the controllers prefer the euphemism common-sense gun-safety legislation. But it's the same old wine in a new bottle. Most public endorsements of such legislation refer to \"universal\" background checks and some ill-defined \"gun-show loophole.\" (I've addressed these things here.) But occasionally someone slips up and gives us a glimpse of what is perhaps the real objective.\n\nRecently, both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton spoke favorably about Australia's gun laws. After the horrible shootings in Oregon, Obama said,\n\nWe know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings. Friends of ours, allies of ours\u2014Great Britain, Australia, countries like ours. So we know there are ways to prevent it.\u201d\n\nClinton, asked about Australia's law at a town-hall meeting, said,\n\nAustralia is a good example, Canada is a good example, the U.K. is a good example. Why? Because each of them have had mass killings. Australia had a huge mass killing about 20, 25 years ago, Canada did as well, so did the U.K. And, in reaction, they passed much stricter gun laws. The Australian government, as part of trying to clamp down on the availability of automatic weapons, offered a good price for buying hundreds of thousands of guns.\n\nShe compared Australia's \"buyback\" program to Obama's \"cash for clunkers\" program under which the government paid people to trade-in their old cars. Crucially, she added about the Australia law, \"I think that\u2019s worth considering. I do not know enough detail to tell you how we would do it, or how would it work, but certainly the Australian example is worth looking at.\"\n\nWhat she and Obama left out is that Australia's \"buyback\" program, unlike \"cash for clunkers,\" was compulsory. It was an eminent-domain action by the state governments. Australia's constitution (like the U.S. Constitution) requires compensation when government takes private property. Thus gun owners were paid through a special tax for the guns they were ordered to surrender. (The program began with rifles and shotguns in 1996 and was extended to handguns in 2003.) In the United States local voluntary gun \"buybacks\" have had unspectacular results.\n\nMoreover, the programs in Australia netted the government no more than a third of the nation's guns. Clinton's questioner was simply wrong when he said, \"Australia managed to \u2026 take away tens of thousands\u2014millions\u2014of handguns, and in one year they were all gone.\" (Emphasis added.) So no matter how you view the subsequent trends in gun violence there (the picture is mixed), the results cannot be attributed to ridding Australia of firearms --because Australia was not rid of guns. Note, however, that the questioner, unlike Clinton and Obama, understands that the government took away -- confiscated -- the guns.\n\nA word about \"buyback\" programs: Nonsense! Since governments don't sell guns to the people they rule, they most certainly cannot buy them back the way a corporation buys back shares of its stock.\n\nA mandatory eminent-domain program for guns would of course be unconstitutional in light of the Second Amendment and theHeller case, which held that the amendment merely affirms a pre-constitutional individual right to keep and bear arms. That may be why Clinton had to \"clarify\" her statement. A spokeswoman said, \"Of course not,\" when asked if Clinton favored gun confiscation. But the fact remains that if you think the Australian law is \"worth considering,\" you're saying that confiscation is worth considering.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "The major political parties both push policies that endanger our most basic liberties.
