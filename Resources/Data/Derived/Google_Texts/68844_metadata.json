The Columbia Journalism Review\u2019s major investigation of what went wrong with the UVA story notes\u2014in its very first sentence, no less\u2014that Renda introduced Erdely to Jackie. That report was published on April 5. The details of Renda\u2019s involvement were known to many reporters who had closely examined the story even before then.\n\nThose who wish to ascribe significance to Renda\u2019s involvement can point to the fact that she is casually linked with the Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights. Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary of OCR and architect of the Title IX inquisition, attended the same White House meetings as Renda. But while federal intervention into the campus rape crisis has certainly ginned up hysteria and led many in the media to uncritically report distortions, it would be improper to hold up this specific connection between the White House, Renda, and Rolling Stone as evidence of some conspiracy.\n\nThe more interesting aspect of Renda\u2019s involvement is that Rolling Stone\u2019s lawyers are now citing her as evidence that UVA had faith in Jackie\u2019s story. Renda was a recent graduate and employee of UVA, and the fact that she recommended Jackie to Erdely amounts to a tacit endorsement, Rolling Stone\u2019s lawyers have claimed in response to Nicole Eramo\u2019s lawsuit.\n\nEramo is a university employee as well\u2014her suit contends the magazine recklessly, unfairly maligned her. In that sense, I can see why Rolling Stone would want to play up Renda\u2019s role in the ordeal.\n\nAnd yet, this argument is fundamentally weak. It wasn\u2019t Renda\u2019s job to fact-check Jackie\u2019s story, it was Erdely\u2019s. Even the most cursory verification effort would have exposed the lie; all Rolling Stone had to do was press Jackie harder for the names of her assailants. (Erdely eventually did this\u2014after the story was already published\u2014and indeed produced a name that revealed Jackie as a fabulist.)\n\nPerhaps Renda can be accused of gullibility\u2014for listening to such an incredible story, and believing it\u2014but that\u2019s all. And even that accusation is weak, since Jackie is known to have changed the details in subsequent retellings. The version she told Renda might have been more plausible than the one she eventually told Erdely.\n\nRolling Stone has every right to lay some of the blame for this debacle on Jackie. The rest belongs to the magazine\u2019s writers and editors\u2014not Renda.\n\n*IJ Review corrected its headline after I pointed this out.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Magazine should take the blame, not Emily Renda.", "title": "Blame Rolling Stone, Not the White House Advisor Who Introduced Jackie", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/07/22/blame-rolling-stone-not-the-white-house", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14375787556315.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Magazine should take the blame, not Emily Renda.", "title": "Blame <em>Rolling Stone</em>, Not the White House Advisor Who Introduced Jackie", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14375787556315.jpg", "creator": "@robbysoave", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-07-22T15:33:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/robby-soave"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "Rolling Stone has every right to lay some of the blame for this debacle on Jackie.\nIn that sense, I can see why Rolling Stone would want to play up Renda\u2019s role in the ordeal.\nEven the most cursory verification effort would have exposed the lie; all Rolling Stone had to do was press Jackie harder for the names of her assailants.\nThe Columbia Journalism Review\u2019s major investigation of what went wrong with the UVA story notes\u2014in its very first sentence, no less\u2014that Renda introduced Erdely to Jackie.\nCatherine Lhamon, assistant secretary of OCR and architect of the Title IX inquisition, attended the same White House meetings as Renda."}
