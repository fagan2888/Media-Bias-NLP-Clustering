The court is currently weighing a separate case challenging health insurance subsidies that are key to Obamacare\u2019s implementation. A ruling is due by the end of June.\n\nIn the case that the justices rejected on Monday, Arizona-based business owner Nick Coons and Dr. Eric Novack, an orthopedic surgeon, sued in 2011 in litigation backed by a conservative legal group.\n\nAmong other things, they challenged the Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, a 15-member government panel dubbed by some Republicans as a \"death panel\" because of its intended role in trimming costs within Medicare, the government healthcare program for the elderly and disabled.\n\nLower courts threw out the lawsuit. In its August 2014 ruling, the appeals court said that the plaintiffs had not shown they had suffered any harm that they could sue over.\n\nOn the IPAB claim, the court noted that under the terms of the healthcare law, the board acts only if Medicare spending increases at a certain level. The earliest it could ever take any action that could potentially reduce Novack\u2019s Medicare reimbursements would be in 2019.\n\nThe plaintiffs, represented by the Phoenix, Arizona-based conservative Goldwater Institute, also challenged a provision of the law, known as the individual mandate, that requires Americans to obtain health insurance. Those claims were also rejected.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate in 2012.\n\nThe case on which the court acted on is Coons v. Lew, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-525.\n\n(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Editing by Will Dunham)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Lawrence Hurley", "Author": "Lawrence Hurley", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a new challenge to President Barack Obama's healthcare law that took aim at a bureaucratic board labeled by some Republicans as a \"death panel\" because it was designed to cut Medicare costs.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20150401&t=2&i=1037153538&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPEB2T0KP", "title": "U.S. Supreme Court rejects Obamacare 'death panel' challenge", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article -
