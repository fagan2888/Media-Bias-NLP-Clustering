The bill provides no exception for rape, incest, or fetal anomalies.\n\nThe law, to take effect in early 2014, was passed Wednesday in both chambers of the Michigan Legislature and is protected by a rarely used legislative loophole which effectively insulates the measure from the governor\u2019s veto power.\n\nOpponents have equated the policy to \u201crape insurance,\u201d as a woman would not be eligible to purchase the insurance rider once pregnant - regardless of the circumstances. The only exceptions to the policy are for a woman\u2019s health in the case of miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, or \u201cto avert her death.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t buy a rider once you were pregnant to have [an abortion] covered,\u201d Meghan Groen, director of government relations for Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan, told RH Reality Check in November. \u201cIt\u2019s not like, \u2018Oh, I was raped and so now I\u2019ll buy this rider.\u2019 Nobody is anticipating being a victim of crime.\u201d\n\nA similar bill was vetoed last year by Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, who then called the proposal \u201ctoo extreme.\u201d In 2000, former Gov. John Engler also vetoed a similar bill.\n\nThis time around, an uncommon procedure allowed in the state\u2019s constitution was used to circumvent Snyder and an overall referendum that would require the initiative to reach Michigan voters.\n\nThe anti-choice group Right to Life Michigan used the obscure provision, which says that a proposal can go directly to the Legislature if three percent of state residents sign in support of the initiative. The House and Senate can then pass it without the possibility of the governor\u2019s veto - if both chambers act within 40 days of the state canvassing board\u2019s approval of the initiative\u2019s validity. Right to Life submitted 315,477 signatures, more than the required 258,088.\n\nThe legislative initiative provision has been used only four times in the state\u2019s history; three of those times were by Right to Life Michigan.\n\nThe Michigan Senate passed the bill 27 to 11, with all Republicans and one Democrat voting in support. The House approved the law by a vote of 62-47, with all Republicans, two Democrats, and one Independent supporting it.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge government overreach and Right to Life went too far again,\u201d said state Rep. Marcia Hovey-Wright (D), according to the Detroit Free Press. \u201cDo not underestimate the power of a lot of angry women and the men who support us. A yes vote puts you on the wrong side of history.\u201d\n\nBut one Republican supporter said women are not monolithic on the issue.\n\n\"I respect the seriousness of the emotions. I went through an unplanned pregnancy. I've counseled people who've been raped that has resulted in pregnancies\u2026,\u201d said Rep. Margaret O'Brien, the AP reported. \u201cBut I've also seen women who've embraced those babies through rape and seen that that child shouldn't be punished for the horrendous act that happened to them.\"\n\nRepublicans said the move was legal and that signatures came from residents in all 83 state counties. They also claimed the measure makes sure abortions are not subsidized by taxpayers, though Groen pointed out that \u201cit\u2019s illegal in federal and state law for any taxpayer dollars to go toward abortion,\u201d nor do federal dollars pay for abortions in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s new insurance exchanges.\n\nMichigan is the 24th state to ban most coverage of abortion care within the new insurance exchanges. Only eight other states have insurance restrictions as tough as Michigan\u2019s new law.\n\nDuring the debate over the bill, state Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer (D) spoke out against the proposal, revealing that she was raped while in college 20 years ago.\n\n\u201cThank God it didn\u2019t result in a pregnancy because I can\u2019t imagine going through what I went through and then having to consider what to do about an unwanted pregnancy from an attacker,\u201d Whitmer said, according to AP. \u201cIf this were law then and I had become pregnant, I would not be able to have coverage because of this. How extreme, how extreme does this measure need to be?\u201d\n\nIn late November, a statewide poll found that a narrow majority of likely Michigan voters said they opposed the effort to demand women buy an abortion coverage rider, the Detroit News reported.\n\nOpponents to the law in and outside the Legislature have said they will soon begin efforts to overturn the policy via their own petition drive, the Detroit Free Press reported.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Michigan Legislature has passed a ban on abortion coverage in private and public insurance plans, requiring women to buy an extra policy before becoming pregnant.
