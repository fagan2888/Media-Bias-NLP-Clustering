But none of this is aberrational.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Excerpt from a column by investigative journalist Glenn Greenwald, posted on his website, The Intercept, on August 14, sharply criticizing the transfer of military gear to local police.\n\n\u201cAmerican policing has become unnecessarily and dangerously militarized, in large part through federal programs that have armed state and local law enforcement agencies with the weapons and tactics of war, with almost no public discussion or oversight\u2026.The use of paramilitary weapons and tactics to conduct ordinary law enforcement\u2026has no place in contemporary society.\u201d\n\n\u2013 Excerpt from a lengthy American Civil Liberties Union report, released in June, under the title: \u201cWar Comes Home: The Excessive Militarization of American Policing.\u201d\n\nWE CHECKED THE CONSTITUTION, AND\u2026\n\nIt was an article of civic faith, with America\u2019s founding generation, that a \u201cstanding army\u201d during peacetime was a menace to liberty. Indeed, one of the reasons for the break from Great Britain was the perceived abuse by the Crown in the use of its uniformed military to keep the colonists in line. Parliament, in a series of \u201cquartering acts,\u201d had required the colonists to pay part of the costs of those forces, and actually compelled colonists to provide housing for British soldiers if there were no other place for their lodging.\n\nSome of the resulting resentment led colonial ratifying assemblies, when considering the new Constitution, to demand some protection against such intrusions. The result was the Third Amendment. Although its ban on the quartering of soldiers in private homes now seems very dated, it has a continuing resonance in an innate American suspicion of military forces being used to keep order on the home-front.\n\nAnd, while the fact is not well known in this country, there has long been \u2013 since 1878 \u2013 a federal law that generally forbids the use of national military troops in law enforcement within this country. It is called the \u201cPosse Comitatus Act.\u201d After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, Congress relaxed the Act\u2019s ban, permitting the president to deploy troops to keep order within the U.S. \u2013 but only when state officials are overwhelmed by domestic violence, a terrorist attack, or a natural disaster. It thus is still, legally speaking, a rarity to have federal soldiers in the role of domestic peacekeepers.\n\nThere is a strong echo of the suspicion that has long been a part of the American civic psyche playing out now in the Missouri suburb of Ferguson, amid heightened racial tensions between citizenry and local police.\n\nLike many municipal police departments across the country, the Ferguson department has been amply supplied \u2013 often for free \u2014 with surplus military weapons and vehicles, unneeded castoffs of Pentagon surplus from various American operations abroad. And, at the outset of sometimes violent unrest in that Missouri community, those imposing supplies were rolled out in a way that seemed fitting for a combat zone. Quickly, officials at the state and national level concluded that this would only aggravate the attempt to restore order.\n\nThere is no doubt, constitutionally, that keeping order on the streets of every American city and town is a duty assigned to state and local government. That is the very essence of the broad concept of \u201cpolice power.\u201d The federal government, constitutionally, does not share in the \u201cpolice power\u201d except in times of unmanageable domestic unrest.\n\nWhat has happened in the post-9/11 era, however, is that the clear demarcation of authority between local police and national military forces has been blurred, by beefing up local police with the weapons, machines and tactics of war. So outfitted, the local officers are still carrying out their accustomed duties, but the impression they convey is conspicuously more threatening to local populations not normally confronted by armored personnel carriers and machine guns.\n\nMoreover, many critics of such military displays believe that the actual training that local police get to enable them to deploy such equipment has a strong tendency to lead officers to feel embattled and threatened, as if they were being readied for combat duty. This may be an exaggeration, but the mere possibility of that happening can excite suspicion and anxiety among local citizens, as it certainly has among civil liberties advocacy groups.\n\nAnd the nightly portrayal of these displays on national television news and commentary broadcasts has added to the damaging effect of the imagery. In the recent TV coverage of the Ferguson unrest, the imagery has stirred state and national leaders to act to try to ease the sense of crisis by taking the implements of war off the streets.\n\nOne potential practical effect of this experience is that a new debate seems to be starting over the nature of local policing, and a part of that debate apparently will focus on whether the program of military giveaways may have had some seriously unfortunate consequences, and may well need to be modified. Some of the resentment behind the Third Amendment perhaps could be a helpful part of this public discourse.\n\nRecent Stories on Constitution Daily\n\nMore journalist arrests in Ferguson add to First Amendment media debate\n\nThe debate over Ferguson and videotaping police\n\n10 fun facts about the 42nd president, Bill Clinton\n\nConstitution Check: Should criminal charges be used to settle a political dispute?/a>\n\nShare:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Constitution Daily", "description": "Lyle Denniston, the National Constitution Center's adviser on constitutional literacy, looks at a new debate over the nature of local policing, and if a program of military giveaways may have had s...", "title": "Constitution Check: Is there a problem in outfitting local police like combat soldiers?", "url": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2014/08/constitution-check-is-there-a-problem-in-outfitting-local-police-like-combat-soldiers/", "image": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ferguson_Day_4_Photo400.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Ferguson_Day_4_Photo400.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"admins": 59543893235, "page_id": 59543893235, "app_id": 108483985888821}, "google-site-verification": "g-YRZSJfme1Aa6j71jlmtj3ZRUHZKtKda1U7n-deAIA", "msvalidate.01": "7A707BA806870C4CB077BE8CFB94D00F", "article": {"published_time": "2014-08-21T10:00:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-20T17:05:35+00:00", "author": "http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/author/lyle-denniston/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdc74\"", "article_summary": "What has happened in the post-9/11 era, however, is that the clear demarcation of authority between local police and national military forces has been blurred, by beefing up local police with the weapons, machines and tactics of war.\nQuickly, officials at the state and national level concluded that this would only aggravate the attempt to restore order.\nThere is no doubt, constitutionally, that keeping order on the streets of every American city and town is a duty assigned to state and local government.\nIt thus is still, legally speaking, a rarity to have federal soldiers in the role of domestic peacekeepers.\nAlthough its ban on the quartering of soldiers in private homes now seems very dated, it has a continuing resonance in an innate American suspicion of military forces being used to keep order on the home-front."}
