That\u2019s not the point. The point is we asked for a right to prayer and were denied our constitutional right to pray. I\u2019m not one of those that wants to pick a fight or look for a fight. But I\u2019m just afraid in our nation if we don\u2019t stand up for what we believe biblically, then we\u2019ll just continue to lose rights and privileges. And I think the Lord wants us to stand up for what\u2019s right.\n\nThe executive director of the Florida High School Athletic Association, Roger Dearing, conveyed the reasoning behind the decision in emails to Euler and his counterpart at University Christian School.\n\nDearing said in the email\u2014which Euler provided to The Daily Signal\u2014that a prayer said over the PA system could not be allowed because the football facility predominantly is paid for by tax dollars. Also, the athletic association acts on behalf of the state, as a \u201cstate actor,\u201d so it could not \u201clegally permit or grant permission for such an activity.\u201d\n\n\u201cI totally understand the desire, and why your request is made,\u201d Dearing wrote. \u201cHowever, for me to grant the wish could subject this association to tremendous legal entanglements.\u201d\n\nEuler said this reasoning \u201cis flawed at the core.\u201d He noted that the Florida Legislature prays in the State Capitol building, and that same right ought to be allowed in a public football stadium.\n\n\u201cPeople of faith do not lose their religious freedom just because they use public facilities,\u201d said Melody Wood, a research assistant for the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at The Heritage Foundation. \u201cWhen teams want to pray together voluntarily, they should not be discriminated against simply because the content of their message is religious.\u201d\n\nCorey Sobers, a spokesman for state\u2019s athletic association, told The Daily Signal that the group did not prevent students and parents from the two schools from praying.\n\n\u201cThe issue was putting it on the public address system, not the fact that they were praying,\u201d Sobers said:\n\nCertainly they were able to pray on their own. They could certainly do so in the locker room, they could do so on the field. That was not an issue, but the part about blasting it over the public address system, that was the one thing that was denied.\n\nPraying over the PA system \u201cwould have been a potential legal issue for the association,\u201d Sobers added.\n\nEuler took issue with this.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that it seems like prayer in our country has become something that you can do that is appropriate to do during times of mourning and loss and tragedy, but it is placed on the back burner in times of thanksgiving and excitement,\u201d Euler said.\n\nWithout a football field of its own, Cambridge Christian hosted its state tournament games leading up to the championship at public facilities.\n\n\u201cThose were state tournament games just like this one was. There was no difference to them,\u201d Euler said. The school was able to have prayer over the loudspeaker at those games.\n\nPlayers and fans of the two Christian school teams responded to the situation with prayer in another form. Both football teams gathered midfield to pray before the game. Fans recited the Lord\u2019s Prayer after singing the national anthem.\n\nUniversity went on to trounce Cambridge, 61-16.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Tim Euler, head of one of the schools, said an athletic association's reasoning for why the schools couldn't pray over a PA system \u201cis flawed at the core.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Tim Euler, head of one of the schools, said an athletic association's reasoning for why the schools couldn't pray over a PA system \u201cis flawed at the core.\u201d", "title": "Two Christian High Schools Denied Prayer Over PA System", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151207_FootballPrayer_Jessen.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-12-08T18:03:47+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ICIcEB"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Tim Euler, head of one of the schools, said an athletic association's reasoning for why the schools couldn't pray over a PA system \u201cis flawed at the core.\u201d", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151207_FootballPrayer_Jessen.jpg"}, "title": "Two Christian High Schools Denied Prayer Over PA System", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "religious freedom", "published_time": "2015-12-08T16:51:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-12-08T18:03:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Florida prayer, Christian schools. football prayer, University Christian, Cambridge Christian, prayer in school, public prayer"}, "article_summary": "Cambridge Christian School in Tampa and University Christian School in Jacksonville agreed to have a public prayer said before their 2A state championship game kickoff Friday in Orlando.\nFlorida\u2019s high school athletic association, the host and coordinator of the event, denied the request to say a prayer over the public address system.\nPlayers and fans of the two Christian school teams responded to the situation with prayer in another form.\nRepresentatives of two Christian high schools in Florida were not allowed to say a prayer over a loudspeaker before a state championship game.\nThe point is we asked for a right to prayer and were denied our constitutional right to pray."}
