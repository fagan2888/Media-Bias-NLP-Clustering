President Barack Obama used his weekly address Saturday to emphasize the importance of a balanced budget, immigration reform, and passage of a farm bill, post government shutdown.

His remarks came a little more than 48 hours after the end of a 16-day shutdown, with Obama adding that “there were no winners” in the aftermath of the third longest government closure in U.S. history.

“I’ll look for willing partners from either party to get important work done,” the president said.

In the GOP’s weekly address, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli — who opposed reopening the government — blasted Obamacare. “[T]he law that carries the President’s name is the hallmark of a reckless federal government that has lost its way,” he said.
