Districts need to be aware of it. There will be a push for more employee contributions,\u201d said Jeffery S. Ammerman, director of technical assistance for the Pennsylvania Association of School Business Officials.\n\nAmmerman said his group does not have specific figures showing how many districts are asking for greater employee contributions, but he is confident there is a trend toward those who are.\n\n\u201cNo one likes it. The Cadillac tax does not benefit the employer or employee. It's just money that goes straight to the federal government,\u201d he said.\n\nWho would pay the tax \u2014 the district or its employees \u2014 is unclear, officials with the Pennsylvania State Education Association said. It could be subject to negotiation in contract talks, they said.\n\nTom DeGeorge, a teacher who represents Butler Area School District's teachers, is going back and forth with administrators about health care costs. Butler Area's contract expires at the end of this month.\n\nDeGeorge said he would like higher deductibles, premiums and co-pays to be phased in. Butler Area spends $19,543 a year for family coverage per employee, about $8,000 less than the Cadillac tax threshold.\n\nThe PSEA, the state's largest teachers union, has not opposed the tax, though its umbrella group, the National Education Association, has.\n\n\u201cIt is too early to say what impact it will have,\u201d said PSEA spokesman Wythe Keever. \u201cWe are concerned about anything that would make health care less accessible to our members.\u201d\n\nTypically, government employees have enjoyed more generous benefits than private-sector workers. Nationally, public-sector employees contributed an average of $3,088 for family coverage in 2012. Private-sector employees contributed an average of $4,236 for family coverage that year.\n\nJon Perry, director of financial services for Franklin Regional School District, where the teachers' contract expires in a year, said the Cadillac tax has come up there.\n\n\u201cNo one wants to come up against this tax,\u201d said Matt Edgell, a Pittsburgh-based spokesman for the PSEA, which represents more than 92 bargaining units in Allegheny County. Of those, 26 are negotiating contracts that have expired or will before the start of the school year.\n\nWayne Wismar, business manager in the Hempfield School District, likened the tax to a penalty tax. He said his district's costs to provide family coverage can run as high as $20,000 a year.\n\n\u201cIt's almost a penalty tax for too rich a coverage,\u201d Wismar said.\n\nLong before the Affordable Care Act was enacted, public schools had plenty of incentive to control health care costs, said Jill Swaney, business manager at the Mars Area School District. School districts for years have known their required contributions to employee pensions will rise sharply.\n\nSwaney said she is not worried about Mars exceeding the \u201cCadillac\u201d limits, even when the district renegotiates a contract in two years. Mars pays about $17,000 a year to provide family coverage.\n\n\u201cHeath care is always an issue. The cost of it has been an issue for decades. We've gone from HMOs to PPOs to plans with high deductibles,\u201d Swaney said.\n\nRick Wills is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Rick Wills", "description": "Many Pennsylvania public school districts renegotiating contracts are wary of getting stuck with hefty tax bills if they do not control health care spending. ...", "pubdate": "2015-06-06 21:00:19", "author": "Rick Wills", "og": {"site_name": "TribLIVE.com", "description": "Many Pennsylvania public school districts renegotiating contracts are wary of getting stuck with hefty tax bills if they do not control health care spending. ...", "title": "'Cadillac' tax on health benefits adds hurdle to Pa. teacher contract talks", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVELogo.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-06-06 21:00:19.302", "url": "http://triblive.com/state/pennsylvania/8416450-74/tax-cadillac-care", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "Many Pennsylvania public school districts renegotiating contracts are wary of getting stuck with hefty tax bills if they do not control health care spending. ...", "creator": "@triblive", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "tribbird://", "iphone": "tribbird://"}, "name": {"ipad": "TribLIVE News and Sports", "iphone": "TribLIVE News and Sports"}, "id": {"ipad": 328217517, "iphone": 328217517}}, "title": "'Cadillac' tax on health benefits adds hurdle to Pa. teacher contract talks", "site": {"identifier": "@triblive", "id": 20269833}, "image": "http://triblive.com/csp/mediapool/sites/TribLIVE/assets2/img/logos/triblive/TribLIVETwitter.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-06 21:00:19", "fb": {"app_id": 144410955752326}, "sailthru.title": "'Cadillac' tax on health benefits adds hurdle to Pa. teacher contract talks", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=328217517", "sailthru.canonical": "http://triblive.com/state/pennsylvania/8416450-74/tax-cadillac-care", "keywords": "tax, cadillac, care, district, contract", "headline": "'Cadillac' tax on health benefits adds hurdle to Pa. teacher contract talks", "sailthru.tags": "Newsletter, News, Pennsylvania", "article": {"category": "News", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/triblive", "published_time": "2015-06-06 21:00:19", "subcategory": "Pennsylvania", "mainsection": "News", "section": "News", "publishedtoweb": "2015-06-06 21:00:19", "modified_time": "2015-06-06 21:00:19.302", "tag": "tax, cadillac, care, district, contract", "subsection": "Pennsylvania", "title": "'Cadillac' tax on health benefits adds hurdle to Pa. teacher contract talks", "author": "Rick Wills"}, "docauthor": "Rick Wills", "sailthru.description": "Many Pennsylvania public school districts renegotiating contracts are wary of getting stuck with hefty tax bills if they do not control health care spending. ..."}, "article_summary": "'Cadillac' tax on health benefits adds hurdle to Pa. teacher contract talksEmail Newsletters Sign up for one of our email newsletters.\nThe Cadillac tax will affect all Americans, but it is becoming a concern for teachers unions and cash-strapped school districts facing difficult contract negotiations.\nTom DeGeorge, a teacher who represents Butler Area School District's teachers, is going back and forth with administrators about health care costs.\nThe Affordable Care Act's so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d tax is indexed to inflation, though studies show health-care costs are rising at a rate higher than that.\n\u201cWe are concerned about anything that would make health care less accessible to our members.\u201dTypically, government employees have enjoyed more generous benefits than private-sector workers."}
