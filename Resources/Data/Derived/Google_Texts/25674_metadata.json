They don\u2019t believe they can fight and make the case that they are not shutting down the government. They are defunding part of one program or something like that and Defense and Justice and all the rest are being funded. They are afraid of going back, sitting on that hot stove a second time because they feel they were burned good the first time. Look, these fellas think they got it all coming to them in 2016 as long as they don\u2019t pick on these issues that move the base.\u201d\n\nBuchanan concluded by arguing that such fear was unfounded in light of similar dire predictions that Republicans would face electoral doom for shutting down the government over Obamacare and opposing gun control that failed to come true.\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "article_metadata": {"description": "Buchanan: GOP Leadership Has Same Agenda as Chamber of Commerce", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Buchanan: GOP Leadership Has Same Agenda as Chamber of Commerce", "title": "Buchanan: GOP Leadership Has Same Agenda as Chamber of Commerce - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/12/10/Buchanan%201210%20Thumbnail.jpg", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/video/2014/12/10/buchanan-gop-leadership-has-same-agenda-as-chamber-of-commerce/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Buchanan: GOP Leadership Has Same Agenda as Chamber of Commerce", "title": "Buchanan: GOP Leadership Has Same Agenda as Chamber of Commerce - Breitbart", "image": "http://cdn.breitbart.com/mediaserver/Breitbart/Breitbart-TV/2014/12/10/Buchanan%201210%20Thumbnail.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true", "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Capitol Hill, FOX NEWS, Pat Buchanan,Breitbart TV,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "section": "Breitbart TV", "tag": "Pat Buchanan", "published_time": "2014-12-10T21:51:22-07:00", "categories": "Breitbart TV"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "He also said of the GOP leadership \u201cwhat they\u2019re afraid of is the media, Sean.\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERColumnist Pat Buchanan declared \u201cfind out what the agenda is of the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable and you will find out what the agenda is of the leadership of the Republican Party on Capitol Hill\u201d on Wednesday\u2019s \u201cHannity\u201d on the Fox News Channel.\n\u201cThere are parts of the Republican Party, the corporate conservatives or the corporate Republicans, they want an amnesty\u2026and basically they\u2019re throwing the Tea Party folks under the bus\u201d he stated.\nThey don\u2019t believe they can fight and make the case that they are not shutting down the government.\nThey are defunding part of one program or something like that and Defense and Justice and all the rest are being funded."}
