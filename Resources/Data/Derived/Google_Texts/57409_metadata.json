These kids \u2014 ignorant of the days of dial-up \u2014 have been able to readily connect to the Web since their inception.\n\nTech savvy was measured with Ofcom\u2019s \u201cdigital quotient\u201d test (DQ test), which does not test basic intelligence but rather awareness and confidence with technology \u2014 from gadgets, to the Internet, to smartphone apps. Ofcom tested 2000 adults and 800 children.
