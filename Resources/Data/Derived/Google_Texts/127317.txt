Look, I understand being a bit annoyed when something happens that you don't like or are opposed to. After all, I lived through the 1970s. I also understand trying to change things when possible. But the definition of insanity is to continue to do the same thing over and over while expecting a different result. Based on that definition, the Republicans putting forward this budget are completely nuts. If you or I told our bosses that the plan we were handing in for the new year contained the exact same objectionable line that sank it last year, our boss would want to know what she was paying us for and what we'd done with all our time. If nothing else had changed in the course of the year to make the outcome different, why were we wasting her time?
