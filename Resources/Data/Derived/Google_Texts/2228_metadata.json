But many companies cite securities laws as a reason for going silent the weeks leading up to the release of earnings reports. Humana stated that it will address 2015 earnings during its second quarter earnings conference call, scheduled for July 29.\n\nAdditionally, the Louisville-based insurer dropped out of a major healthcare conference, as Humana Chief Financial Officer Brian Kane was set to speak Wednesday at a Goldman Sachs global event in California. The move likely will refuel the rumor mill of a forthcoming deal, reported the Associated Press.\n\nNow may be a better time than ever for market consolidation. Humana's Medicare business is strong and continues to grow steadily, with more than 3 million Medicare Advantage members, while the insurer also benefits from stable reimbursement levels, reported The Street.\n\nWhat's more, deals have been on hold since 2011, partly due to the economy and partly due to the uncertainty surrounding the Affordable Care Act.

Aetna and Cigna shares climbed less than 1 percent, while Anthem shares fell slightly, according to the AP.\n\nFor more:\n\n- here's the SEC filing\n\n- read the WSJ article\n\n- check out the AP story\n\n- here's The Street piece\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nHow a Humana acquisition would reshape the market\n\nAetna poised to make an offer for Cigna, Humana\n\nHumana still attractive acquisition target, but priced too high\n\nBooming Medicare business could make Humana an acquisition target", "article_metadata": {"description": "In light of the\u00a0recent speculations regarding a potential Humana acquisition, the insurer issued an 8-K\u00a0filing\u00a0Monday to relay that it will enter a quiet period because it's not \"company policy to comment on rumors or speculation regarding possible merger activity.\"", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthPayer", "description": "In light of the\u00a0recent speculations regarding a potential Humana acquisition, the insurer issued an 8-K\u00a0filing\u00a0Monday to relay that it will enter a quiet period because it's not \"company policy to comment on rumors or speculation regarding possible merger activity.\"", "title": "Humana enters quiet period until July 29, refueling acquisition rumors", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthpayer.com/story/humana-enters-quiet-period-until-july-29-refueling-acquisition-rumors/2015-06-09", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthpayer.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "healthpayer", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "keywords": "Aetna,Anthem,Cigna,Humana acquisition,Medicare Business,Medicare,Medicaid,CHIP,Operations & Business Management", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Medicare,Medicaid,CHIP,Operations & Business Management"}, "article_summary": "Aetna and Cigna shares climbed less than 1 percent, while Anthem shares fell slightly, according to the AP.\nHumana stated that it will address 2015 earnings during its second quarter earnings conference call, scheduled for July 29.\nIn light of the recent speculations regarding a potential Humana acquisition, the insurer issued an 8-K filing Monday to relay that it will enter a quiet period because it's not \"company policy to comment on rumors or speculation regarding possible merger activity.\"\nFor more:- here's the SEC filing- read the WSJ article- check out the AP story- here's The Street pieceRelated Articles:How a Humana acquisition would reshape the marketAetna poised to make an offer for Cigna, HumanaHumana still attractive acquisition target, but priced too highBooming Medicare business could make Humana an acquisition target\nPublic companies aren't required to enter quiet periods, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out."}
