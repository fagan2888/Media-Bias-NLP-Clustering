At Community Clinic Inc., a group of navigators and in-person assistants were present to reach out to the uninsured community and explain the Affordable Care Act. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)\n\nThe day Maryland\u2019s health insurance exchange opened for business was Rebecca Wener\u2019s first day of work. She sat down next to Maria Martinez on Tuesday in the waiting room of a Silver Spring clinic and started gently asking questions in Spanish.\n\nDo you have health insurance? Wener asked. No, replied Martinez, 44, of Rockville. She works two part-time jobs \u2014 in customer service at Balducci\u2019s, a gourmet food store, and cleaning houses. Do you know that many new options are available to you under health reform? No, Martinez said. She knew that a law had been passed and that everyone had to have insurance, but not much more than that.\n\nWener explained that Martinez might be eligible for Medicaid or perhaps financial aid to help pay for private insurance. Martinez listened intently. Yes, she nodded, she wanted to set up a meeting to get details. Esta bien. She wrote down her name and cellphone number for Wener. Jueves, she said. En la ma\u00f1ana. Thursday morning for the next appointment.\n\nWener, 26, is one of more than 300 \u201cnavigators\u201d and other consumer guides working across Maryland to find people who are uninsured, help them figure out their options and, if they are ready, sign them up online or with a paper application. Specially trained to provide in-person help, these navigators are considered critical to the outreach and enrollment effort.\n\nCommunity Clinic Inc., a private nonprofit group that serves about 50,000 low-income residents at seven locations in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s counties, deployed six consumer guides to its facilities Tuesday. They weren\u2019t sure what to expect; they had been told during their training that there were likely to be technology glitches.\n\n1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Obamacare launches View Photos Uninsured people around the United States showed up at health-care centers and logged onto Web sites on Tuesday hoping to sign up for coverage under President Obama\u2019s sweeping health-care law.

Voisin/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nSure enough, early Tuesday morning, navigator Apoorva Srivastawa, 24, ran into a big one when she opened her laptop and tried to log on to the Maryland Web site at the Silver Spring clinic. The portal was down. It wouldn\u2019t be available until noon. And throughout the rest of the day, the high volume of traffic made it virtually impossible for navigators to work online, according to Wendy Korrick, CCI\u2019s outreach and enrollment director.\n\nThe Silver Spring clinic is usually relatively quiet on Tuesday mornings; fewer patients are scheduled for that day because clinic directors hold an administrative meeting. But at the nonprofit\u2019s other locations in Takoma Park, Gaithersburg and Greenbelt, waiting rooms were full of patients eager to learn more about their health insurance options. Without access to the Web site, navigators started using paper applications. By late afternoon, at least seven applications in total had been started from those three locations, Korrick said. At least a dozen more people had scheduled a return trip to complete the process, navigators said.\n\nThe response has been \u201cpretty significant,\u201d Korrick said. \u201cPeople are eager to learn. A lot of people have scheduled an appointment.\u201d\n\nMartinez was one of them. Wener told her to bring a picture ID and, if possible, proof of income and residency. The Rockville resident can buy insurance from Balducci\u2019s, but it costs $70 a week, Martinez said \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s expensive.\u201d\n\nShe earns $21,000 to $22,000 a year. A few years ago, she had to go to the emergency room at Holy Cross Hospital in Silver Spring for back problems. She couldn\u2019t afford the $600 bill but was able to get financial assistance from the hospital to cover it.\n\nMartinez said she wants to get insurance now. \u201cYou just never know,\u201d she said in Spanish.\n\nAt CCI\u2019s clinic in Greenbelt, Che Sayles, 38, was the consumer helper, known as an \u201cassister,\u201d who spent his morning talking with two men and two women whose incomes appeared to make them eligible for the state\u2019s expanded Medicaid coverage. He signed up one person for Medicaid, and provided information or set up return appointments for the others. The recently opened clinic draws from low- and moderate-income communities in Prince George\u2019s County. At least 10 percent of the county\u2019s nearly 1 million residents lack health insurance and have limited access to primary medical care.\n\nFor many Prince George\u2019s residents, Sayles will be the first person they have ever spoken with about obtaining health insurance. He collects basic information and can contact the customer call center associated with the health exchange. And he can refer the person to a navigator, such as Wener or Srivastawa.\n\nSayles, a political science graduate of Howard University, said he was excited to watch a new government program launch close-up.\n\n\u201cI want to be able to help make a difference,\u201d he said.\n\nA few miles away, at CCI\u2019s Takoma Park clinic, a navigator-and-assister duo spoke with more than 30 people who had appointments Tuesday. Many arrived at the sun-filled second-floor waiting room with young children in tow. They listened as Leidy Rambarde, 27, handed out brochures and explained the basics of the health insurance exchange.\n\nOne woman who arrived with her child didn\u2019t need to hear any explanations.\n\n\u201cShe came in, and she knew what she needed to show us to sign up,\u201d said navigator Alexandra Dixon, 31. The woman brought all her documents: her driver\u2019s license, her Social Security card, even her income tax return.\n\n\u201cShe came straight in to apply today,\u201d Dixon said.\n\nBecause the woman arrived mid-morning, Dixon was not able to enroll her using the online system. So they spent about 30 minutes filling out a paper application. Dixon still needs to get some income information from the woman to complete the process.\n\nThe potential enrollees didn\u2019t seem to mind that there was no online access or that the paper applications were harder to understand because they were not in Spanish.\n\n\u201cShe was very happy,\u201d Dixon said.\n\nNavigators said they were buoyed by the eagerness and receptiveness they found.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very excited,\u201d Wener said. \u201cIt\u2019s cool. We really came in expecting everything to go off the rails.\u201d\n\nMiranda Spivack contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The day Maryland\u2019s health insurance exchange opened for business was Rebecca Wener\u2019s first day of work.
