Hickson knows his days in Denver are coming to a close. It\u2019s his hope that wherever his next destination is, ample playing time follows.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be all right,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Nuggets have been trying to trade Hickson for the better part of the past month, attempting to get him into a better situation to continue what should be many more years left in his NBA career. He has been suffering on the bench for most of this season while the Nuggets, stuffed with too many capable players in the frontcourt, go through a youth movement with their bigs.\n\nThat pushed Hickson from spot duty to pretty much no duty unless in an emergency. Hickson hasn\u2019t liked it, and coach Michael Malone said on many occasions that he knows not playing has been tough on the veteran. But Hickson has handled the situation in the classiest manner possible \u2014 by not making waves, by continuing to be arguably the funniest player in the Nuggets\u2019 locker room and, most important, by keeping himself ready to play.\n\nThat\u2019s reflected in his numbers.\n\nWith inconsistent playing time, Hickson has averaged 7.2 points and 4.7 rebounds while shooting 50.5 percent from the field. Per 36 minutes, those numbers look like this: robust averages of 16.2 points and 10.3 rebounds. He is contributing a lot of production in a limited amount of court time.\n\nHickson has made nine starts this season. The Nuggets are 5-4 in those games, and they are 15-26 with any other combination of starters.\n\nHickson, 27, can play power forward or center at 6-foot-9. But with Kenneth Faried, Darrell Arthur, Joffrey Lauvergne, Nikola Jokic and Jusuf Nurkic also at those positions, and with Danilo Gallinari capable of playing power forward too, there are just too many obstacles to get Hickson on the court.\n\nSome other scuttle concerning the Nuggets that I\u2019ve been hearing as the league approaches the Feb. 18 trade deadline.\n\nBlake Griffin isn\u2019t coming to Denver\n\nA report connecting the Nuggets to the Clippers with interest in the veteran all-star made the rounds late last week.\n\nThe Nuggets aren\u2019t the only team that has inquired about what it might take to get Griffin, whose standing in Los Angeles became rocky after his scuffle with a team equipment manager. The Clippers, who are in \u201cwin now\u201d mode, still think they are better off with Griffin than without him and aren\u2019t biting on anything for now. But keep an eye on this situation. If the Clippers are eliminated again in the playoffs, they may decide to make significant changes that could include moving Griffin. The Nuggets would be interested then too.\n\nWill Barton is a hot commodity\n\nTeams are knocking on the Nuggets\u2019 door about the 6-6 guard, who is having a breakout season. They have called a lot about Barton, 25, and even offered first-round picks for him, but he\u2019s not going anywhere. The Nuggets know he is a gem, and they\u2019re going to hold on tight.\n\nInterest in Joffrey Lauvergne continues\n\nMalone has said a few times that Lauvergne is part of the Nuggets\u2019 future, but the second-year center knows business can sometimes get in the way. \u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d he said, when asked if thinks he will be playing for the Nuggets after the trade deadline. Interest in Lauvergne, 24, is nothing new. Calls inquiring about his availability started coming in before the season even started. The Nuggets rebuffed them then and are likely to hold on to him through the trade deadline, but nothing is set in stone.\n\nKenneth Faried always is on teams\u2019 minds\n\nFaried, 26, quietly has had a solid season, holding down the power forward position without missing much time because of injuries. His effort in the Nuggets\u2019 win over Chicago on Friday earned praise from Malone. With a reasonable contract and a big impact on the court, there continue to be suitors for his services as his value remains high. He isn\u2019t officially on the trade block \u2014 never has been, really \u2014 but a \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d offer might entice the Nuggets to pull the trigger on a deal.\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@ denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nKobe Bryant, F, L.A. Lakers\n\nWhen: Bet you didn\u2019t see this coming. And yet, here it is: Kobe Bryant caught fire last week and is The Post\u2019s player of the week.\n\nWhat\u2019s up: In three games Bryant was brilliant, averaging 29.3 points, 8.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists and 2.0 steals. Bryant shot 44 percent from the field and 50 percent from the 3-point line, and he racked up all of these statistics while playing just 29 minutes per game, by far the least time of any of the players among the top 10 scorers during the span. The Lakers won two of the three games.\n\nBackground: Anyone who has watched the Lakers knows this has been an up-and-down season for Bryant, who has already announced this would be his last. But there\u2019s always room for more memorable performances, and Kobe put them on the court during this span. He had a season-high 38 points in a win over Minnesota and put 27 points and 12 rebounds on the board in a Lakers\u2019 win over New Orleans.\n\nDempsey\u2019s take: Bryant\u2019s name on a player-of-the-week list used to be a no-brainer. This season\u2019s struggles have made it very different, but this has been fun having a chance to get him into the award circle one more time. He showed that when he is on and scoring and doing the things that win games, the Lakers do, in fact, win. L.A. is 3-0 when he scores 30 or more and 4-1 when he scores more than 25 points.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Dempsey: Nuggets\u2019 J.J.
