It was redrawn after the 2010 census so it isn\u2019t nearly as GOP dominant as it used to be when Newell upset former Rep. Lauri Clapp in 2008. Newell, of Littleton, won re-election in 2012.\n\nDoty is well known in Arapahoe County, having served as the clerk and recorder before being elected to the commission. Kagan has proved to be a formidable candidate, holding off tough challenges in his last three elections.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Daniel Kagan,Lauri Clapp,Linda Newell,Nancy Doty,Senate District 26", "language": "en, sv", "og": {"site_name": "The Spot", "description": "With Sen.
