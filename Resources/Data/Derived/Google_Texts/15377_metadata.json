Some of those ads, which made it onto our list of the worst campaign ads, have the dubious honor of also appearing on this list.\n\nThis year, we are also highlighting the bipartisan failure of politicians in both parties for failing to accurately describe the impact of the Affordable Care Act. Democrats such as President Obama and Republicans such as House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) either inflated or deflated the numbers to a ridiculous extent. (Before anyone asks, Obama\u2019s \u201cif you want to keep your plan\u201d was on last year\u2019s list.)\n\nWhile The Fact Checker generally focuses on domestic politics, this year Russian President Vladimir Putin gets a special international honor (or dishonor) for his speech on Crimea.\n\nAs always, that and other rulings were met with vehement objections from some readers. The Fact Checker thanks the readers who have offered thoughtful rebuttals to our conclusions. In some cases, in light of new information, we adjusted Pinocchio ratings.\n\nIn compiling this list, which has no particular order, we primarily focused on claims that had earned four Pinocchios during the year. We also tried to focus on issues of broad interest, such as terrorism, health care and the size of government. To keep it simple, we have shortened the quotes in the headlines.

Easley)\n\nIntraparty slap downs are pretty rare, but Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) have radically different foreign policy views. With no evidence but Internet rumors, some promoted by liberal groups, Paul declared that McCain unknowingly met with members of the Islamic State \u2014 and even had photographs taken \u2014 when he had slipped across the border with Syria to meet with rebel forces. But the claim was proven to be absolutely false. As we said as the time, \u201cthere are days when we regret we are limited to just Four Pinocchios.\u201d\n\n(REUTERS/Jason Reed)\n\nPresident Obama, a former senator, got quite a few things wrong here. He spoke of legislation that would help the middle class, but he was counting cloture votes that mostly involved judicial and executive branch nominations. Moreover, he counted all the way back to 2007, meaning he even included votes in which he, as senator, voted against ending debate \u2014 the very thing he decried in his remarks. At best, he could claim the Republicans had blocked about 50 bills, meaning he was off by a factor of ten.\n\n(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nRep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.), equating school lunches to an \u201cempty soul,\u201d told an evocative and supposedly true story about an official who spoke to a boy who had rejected a school lunch because he wanted one in a brown bag. \u201cA kid with a brown-paper bag had someone who cared for him,\u201d the boy supposedly said. But it turned out Ryan\u2019s source for the story had borrowed it from a book \u2013 and the boy, now grown, tries to connect hungry kids with federal programs such as school lunches and food stamps. He even opposes Ryan\u2019s budget plans. Oops. Ryan later said he regretted failing to verify the tall tale.\n\nAlison Lundergan Grimes, the Democratic candidate who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), stood in front of the camera and made statements that she must have known are false. Her central claim \u2014 that McConnell had pocketed $600,000 from anti-coal groups \u2014 had already earned Four Pinocchios. The statement was based on money earned by McConnell\u2019s wife, much of which came from being on a board of bank that finances coal companies. So the \u201canti-coal\u201d moniker was bogus. This desperate effort did little for Grimes, who lost even the coal counties to McConnell.\n\nGeorgia Republican Senate candidate David Perdue accuses his Democratic opponent, Michelle Nunn, of having a campaign plan that says she \"funded organizations linked to terrorists.\" (David Perdue via YouTube)\n\nDavid Perdue (R), ran ads claiming that the Points of Light Foundation once run by Michelle Nunn, his Democratic opponent in Georgia\u2019s Senate race, \u201cfunded organizations linked to terrorists.\u201d His evidence was only a leaked campaign plan for Nunn that said that this would be a bogus attack by Republicans. There was no terrorist link. Points of Light was simply a pass-through for donations from eBay buyers and sellers to charities, including one well-regarded group that had the word \u201cIslamic\u201d in its name. Nevertheless, Perdue went on to win the election.\n\nEditor's note: This ad contains graphic images. The Agenda Project Action Fund, a progressive non-profit group, blames Republican spending cuts for Ebola deaths in this ad. (The Agenda Project via YouTube)\n\nThis Agenda Project Action Fund ad was just a more extreme version of a Democratic talking point\u2014 that GOP budget cuts have harmed the nation\u2019s ability to handle the Ebola outbreak. But Obama\u2019s Republican predecessor oversaw big increases in public-health sector spending, and Democrats and Republicans in recent years have broadly supported efforts to rein in federal spending. In some years, Congress has allocated more money for agencies fighting Ebola than the Obama administration had requested.\n\nIn this ad by the National Rifle Association, Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) is attacked for her stance on gun control. (YouTube/NRA)\n\nThe imagery of this National Rifle Association ad lands it on this list. The ad opens with idyllic scenes of a mother in an upper-middle-class home checking on her baby in the crib and texting a spouse who\u2019s away: \u201cLove You. Good Night.\u201d Then an intruder is shown breaking through the front door \u2014 and the next scene depicts yellow police-line tape and an armed police officer. The ad suggests that Landrieu, in voting for enhanced background checks, made such a tragedy more possible. But even the NRA\u2019s own lawyers acknowledged that nothing in the bill would have prevented the mother in this ad from buying a weapon to defend herself, even on short notice.\n\nThe bipartisan failure in speaking about Obamacare\n\nNo matter the party, politicians had trouble with basic math concerning the number of people gaining insurance through the Affordable Care Act. Here are some of the more notable examples, all of which earned Four Pinocchios.\n\n\u201cTen million Americans have health insurance today who would not have had it without the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Richard Durbin (D-Ill.), Feb. 9\n\nNope. When Durbin made this statement, the most generous estimate of people gaining insurance through the law was 4 million.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got close to 7 million Americans who have access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion.\u201d\n\n\u2014 President Obama, Feb. 20\n\nNope. Depending on the estimate, Obama was either six times too high or just double. Either way, he was way off.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a net loss of people with health insurance\u201d\n\n\u2014 House Speaker John Boehner, March 13\n\nNope. Boehner added apples and then subtracted oranges. At the point he made the statement, it was clear that the net gain was in the millions.\n\n\u201cOnly 64,000 Kentuckians have enrolled in Obamacare private plans, far fewer than 280,000 who received notices their plans were canceled.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), March 29\n\nNope. The 280,000 was an outdated number, and also did not include just individual plans. The number of individual policies affected by the law was about 100,000, and most never ended up getting notices in the first place.\n\nInternational Hall of Shame\n\n(AP Photo/RIA Novosti, Alexei Druzhinin, Presidential Press Service)\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin delivered a speech announcing the annexation of Crimea that was full of whoppers, but none more so than his claim about the referendum. The referendum was rushed, political opposition was squelched, and the choices did not allow for a \u201cno.\u201d (The options were either joining Russia \u2014 what the ballot called \u201creunification\u201d \u2014 or remaining part of Ukraine with greater autonomy, effectively making the region independent in all but name.) Moreover, the Crimea vote met none of the conditions for a referendum in the Ukrainian constitution. Clearly it\u2019s time for a fact-checking organization in Russia.\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nFollow The Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook", "article_metadata": {"description": "Our annual roundup of the most outlandish claims of 2014.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Our annual roundup of the most outlandish claims of 2014.", "title": "The biggest Pinocchios of 2014", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/12/15/the-biggest-pinocchios-of-2014/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/files/2015/12/card-back.gif&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GlennKesslerWP"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2014/12/15/the-biggest-pinocchios-of-2014/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "pinocchios, lie of the year, fact checker list, fact checker, factchecker, glenn kessler, barack obama, obama fact check, biggest pinocchios, if you like your plan, health care fact check, obamacare; affordable care act, rand paul, paul ryan; islamic state, putin", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/FactChecker"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "pinocchios, lie of the year, fact checker list, fact checker, factchecker, glenn kessler, barack obama, obama fact check, biggest pinocchios, if you like your plan, health care fact check, obamacare; affordable care act, rand paul, paul ryan; islamic state, putin"}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s time for our annual round-up of the biggest Pinocchios of the year.\nIn compiling this list, which has no particular order, we primarily focused on claims that had earned four Pinocchios during the year.\nDemocrats such as President Obama and Republicans such as House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) either inflated or deflated the numbers to a ridiculous extent.\nHer central claim \u2014 that McConnell had pocketed $600,000 from anti-coal groups \u2014 had already earned Four Pinocchios.\nHere are some of the more notable examples, all of which earned Four Pinocchios."}
