Up-and-coming pop rockers SomeKindaWonderful made their festival debut at Summerfest on Saturday, headlining the U.S. Cellular Connection Stage.

The band's appearance was a late addition to the Big Gig's lineup and the group's first show in the Midwest, though they have Midwestern roots: The band formed after surreptitiously meeting in a bar in Cleveland, Ohio, and wrote the song "Reverse" on the same night.

Jordy Towers, Matt Gibson, Ben Schigel, Sarah Dyer and Steve Basil of SomeKindaWonderful sat down with Journal Sentinel music writer Piet Levy for a few minutes before their set to talk about the song's meaning and more.
