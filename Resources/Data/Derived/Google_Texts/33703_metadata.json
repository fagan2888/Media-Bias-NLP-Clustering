I used to go for an hour and a half, but now I\u2019m feeling bored and ready to quit after 30 or 40 minutes. I don\u2019t think my body can take it anymore.\u201d\n\nKate wants to learn to race walk, a goofy-looking Olympic sport and vigorous workout that has all the benefits of running but is much easier on the joints and muscles. I know she\u2019s not ready to give up running, and she may find a way to keep going. But her lament prompted today\u2019s lesson about running injuries, and how to prevent them.\n\nI\u2019ll start with the takeaway: The most common running injuries are preventable if you understand how they happen, why they happen, and what you can do keep them from happening to you.\n\n\u25a0 What is a running injury? Any ache or pain that causes you to reduce your weekly running mileage is defined as a running injury. According to a recent overview of running injuries in the IDEA Fitness Journal, knee-related injuries are the most common, followed by foot, ankle, lower leg, hip and low back.\n\nThe aches and pains of running are extremely common, the authors report, and it\u2019s the novice and recreational runners who suffer the most: \u201cExperienced runners tend to have less risk of injury because they develop an innate ability to recognize the onset of an injury and keep it from worsening.\u201d\n\nDeveloping your ability to tune in and listen to your body will teach you how to prevent running injuries. You might have to slow down. You might have to practice yoga or qi gong. You might have to browse through \u201cGray\u2019s Anatomy.\u201d But once Body Awareness happens, it\u2019s the best training buddy you\u2019ll ever have.\n\n\u25a0 Why do injuries happen? There are whole books devoted to the causes of runner\u2019s knee, ITBS (iliotibial band syndrome), shin splints, and other common running injuries. But let\u2019s cut to the chase: Injuries generally happen when your body isn\u2019t strong or flexible enough to take the stress of \u201crepetitive microtrauma.\u201d\n\nRunning is all about repetitive microtrauma. If you\u2019re into running long distances, it can\u2019t be avoided.\n\nThe IDEA journal article\u2019s list of the most common causes of running injuries include:\n\nIncreasing your weekly mileage too quickly.\n\nR unning too long, too often. (Running more than 40 miles a week is seen as significantly risker than running less.)\n\nTraining too hard, or coming back too soon from an injury, without giving your body enough rest, so it can do the work of healing.\n\nRunning on muscles that are out of balance and not strong enough to take the stress.\n\nRunning on inadequate or worn out shoes.\n\n\u25a0 What\u2019s the best treatment? It\u2019s etched in stone at the entrance to the University of Wellbeing: Self care is the best care. Of course we need our doctors, our clinics, our pharmacists, but you have be informed and proactive. To immediately reduce the inflammation that comes with a running injury, start with rest, rest and more rest. Ice \u2014 not heat \u2014 and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) are also part of your first aid kit.\n\nPartner up with a medical practitioner you trust and figure out a more detailed treatment plan, if you need one. Find a rehab program that stresses cross-training \u2014 running in water, swimming, biking \u2014 so you can stay fit while your injury heals.\n\nThis is crucial! Running is addictive and if you\u2019re suddenly side-lined, you need to get that endorphin rush elsewhere. If muscular imbalance or weakness is a likely cause of your pain, get going on a resistance-training program designed to build up and protect muscles and joints.\n\nRunning injuries hurt. And they cost a lot, too. The more you know about what\u2019s causing your injury \u2014 worn out shoes? weak hamstrings? ego issues? \u2014 the better able you are to treat and prevent them.\n\nAnd consider a switch to a different sport. Racewalking! I love it. So do my knees, ankles and hamstrings.\n\nMarilynn Preston is a fitness expert, personal trainer and speaker on healthy lifestyle issues.
