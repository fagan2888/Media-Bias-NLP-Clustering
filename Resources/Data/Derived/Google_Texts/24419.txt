DUNMORE -- Utility crews are still working at the scene of the deadly house explosion in Lackawanna County.

On Saturday, Newswatch 16 found UGI workers on Smith Street in Dunmore where that blast happened Thursday.

Crews said they are using equipment to "purge any residual gas in the area."

Investigators are looking into both the gas line and water main to find out what caused the blast that killed Madlyn Mecca, 86.

Other residents in the area were affected by the explosion and fire.

Anyone who would like to help can make a donation to the fund set up at the First National Community Bank in Dunmore.
