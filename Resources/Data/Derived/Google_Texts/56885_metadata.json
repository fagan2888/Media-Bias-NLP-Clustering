When federal lawmakers wrote that law in 2010, they required states to expand Medicaid, thereby making the regulation regarding transitional coverage unnecessary.\n\nBecause Idaho and a handful of other states see huge flaws in wholesale Medicaid expansion, the federal government wants these states to re-adopt the transition rule, originally written into a 1988 Social Security reform bill.\n\nTom Shanahan, spokesman for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, explained the reasoning behind the regulation.\n\n\u201cTransitional Medicaid allows individuals to begin working and still have access to health coverage for the remainder of the year to ensure they maintain stability in the workforce,\u201d he told IdahoReporter.com.\n\nShanahan noted, in a two-person home with a non-disabled adult and a child, the adult could be disqualified from Medicaid coverage if the parent earns more than $345 each month, or just more than $4,000 a year. If the transitional rule is re-adopted, after the department determines the parent is ineligible for Medicaid due to this income ceiling, government health coverage would continue for up to 12 months.\n\nShanahan said the rule gives struggling families a cushion as they reenter the labor force. \u201cThe challenge families face is that if their income goes up when they get a job and we immediately end benefits, it makes their transition to self-reliance less successful because most face immediate out of pocket expenses while they are trying to get financially stable.\u201d\n\nThe child in that home is, and would remain, eligible for Medicaid coverage until the parent earns more than $2,400 a month.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what will happen if Idaho lawmakers don\u2019t comply with the rule, which Shanahan said is required by the federal government.\n\nWisconsin revealed some flexibility in the regulation during a health-care standoff with the federal government in 2012 and 2013. The state\u2019s Republican governor, Scott Walker, expanded Medicaid for a small segment of Wisconsinites, but as part of a deal struck with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Wisconsin charges a small premium to adults in the transitional Medicaid track.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "IdahoReporter.com", "description": "The federal government wants to force Idaho to re-adopt a Medicaid rule that gives health coverage for up to 12 months to program participants who no longer qualify under income restrictions.
