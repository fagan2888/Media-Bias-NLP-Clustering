The 60-day lawmaking session starts next week, on Tuesday, giving lawmakers just one more week to prepare. And if the lawmakers happen to live in the Tampa Bay, Orlando, Fort Myers, West Palm Beach or Tallahassee media markets, they might just see a new TV ad blitz from the Everglades Trust environmental group, ushering in a new round of\u2026.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nSUGAR WARS \u2013 \u201cA new TV campaign presses for purchase of US Sugar land,\u201d by The Tampa Bay Times\u2019s Adam Smith: \u201cEverglades advocates today launch a six-figure TV, radio and online campaign to push state leaders to use Amendment 1 water and land conservation money to buy U.S. Sugar land south of Lake Okeechobee so more water flows to the Everglades. The campaign highlights a contract U.S. Sugar and the state signed in 2010 under Gov. Charlie Crist, a contract that will expire by the end of the legislative session unless the legislature acts. The cost of the land buy is roughly estimated at about $350-million.\u201d\n\n\u201cU.S. Sugar signed a binding written contract, and just four months ago, 75 percent of Floridians voted for a constitutional amendment to set aside the money to pay for land acquisition projects such as this one. This is our last, best chance to protect drinking water, save the Everglades and reduce deadly discharges of pollution from the lake into the St. Lucie and Caloosahatchee Rivers and estuaries -- and time is running out,\u201d said Mary Barley, President of Everglades Trust. \u201cIt\u2019s now up to Governor Scott and the legislature to tell U.S. Sugar, \u2018a deal is a deal.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1AzujiZ\n\nThe real winner: consultants, TV stations. The reality is that the ad buy is small, and its effect will likely be minimal. Big Sugar dominates in Tallahassee, and a few environmentalists probably aren\u2019t going to do much to persuade the GOP-led Legislature, especially in a non-election year. Indeed, House Speaker Steve Crisafulli is already opposed to the land buy. But at least the TV stations and political consultants will make their money.\n\n\u2026.now as for that other crop \u2026.\n\nMEDICAL MARIJUANA \u2013 \u201cIn a twist, fight for medical pot goes to Florida Statehouse,\u201d by the Associated Press\u2019s Matt Sedensky: \u201cRepublicans lawmakers in Florida who once opposed medical pot are now embracing it, motivated by the strong show of support from voters and worried that another constitutional amendment during next year's presidential race could drive opponents to the polls. Last year, lawmakers in the GOP-controlled Legislature passed a law to allow low-potency strains of marijuana helpful to a very limited group of patients. It got about 58 percent of the vote in November, but needed 60 percent to pass under Florida law.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018It's the ultimate poll,\u2019 said Sen. Jeff Brandes, a Republican. \u2018It shows that there is momentum for this issue, that it will likely pass in the future and that there is an ability right now in this window of time to address this issue in the legislative process.\u2019\u201d http://yhoo.it/1B8PPOQ\n\nFLASHBACK: IT\u2019S NOT A SLAM DUNK So said GOP political consultant Tre Evers after the November vote http://hrld.us/1DIcfHk\n\n\u201cDWS AND CANNABIS \u2013 WHAT IS BEHIND HER POSITION?\u201d That\u2019s what liberal blogger Kartik Krishnaiyer asks in The Florida Squeeze blog about Debbie Wasserman Schultz and her \u201cbizarre positioning last year on Amendment 2.\u201d Krishnaiyer speculates that she\u2019s either out of touch with activists or \u201cthat Wasserman Schultz very well might be paying back pharmaceutical companies and perhaps even the insurance lobby with her inexplicable stand on Medical Marijuana.\u201d http://bit.ly/1DN4wGp\n\n\u201cDebbie Wasserman Schultz denies claim, despite messages\u201d I wrote Friday in POLITICO: \u201cDemocratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on Friday denied claims that her staff offered a deal to reverse her opposition to medical marijuana in order to silence a Florida donor\u2019s criticisms \u2014 attributing the controversy to a misunderstanding. But text messages and emails obtained by POLITICO indicate her top political adviser was aware of some type of offer to donor John Morgan, who is accusing the South Florida congresswoman of after-the-fact spin.\u201d http://politi.co/1BvEHLE\n\n\u201cSenate bid could be solution for Wasserman Schultz\u201d Edward-Isaac Dovere wrote Friday in POLITICO: \u201cEven if Sen. Marco Rubio doesn\u2019t leave his seat open for a White House run, Florida often tilts Democratic in presidential years, and Clinton would most likely be at the top of the ticket drawing out women and African-Americans in heavy numbers. A high-profile congresswoman with a strong base and proven fundraising record, Republicans and Democrats agree, has all the makings of a very competitive Senate candidate. There\u2019s just one problem: Many Democrats don\u2019t want her to run for Senate either\u2026.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018I don\u2019t think the Senate is a default position,\u2019 said Democratic consultant James Carville. \u2018It\u2019s not like, maybe you can be designated hitter.\u2019\u201d http://politi.co/1CU9EVj\n\nHECKLED: \u201cImmigration activists briefly interrupt Marco Rubio book-tour stop at Miami Dade College,\u201d by The Miami Herald\u2019s Patricia Mazzei: \u201cA hometown visit by U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio to promote his new book drew a crowd of hundreds to Miami Dade College on Friday evening -- including at least a half a dozen immigration activists who interrupted the Republican several times before being escorted out by security. \u2018You're a hypocrite,\u2019 a young activist yelled at Rubio. Another flipped him off and swore at the senator as she was being ushered out.\u201d\n\nRUBIO\u2019S RESPONSE: \u201cI just hope they bought the book,\u201d Rubio quipped. \u201cI'm the only one who gets heckled by both sides of the immigration debate.\u201d http://bit.ly/1AzyXxA\n\n\u201cThis Marco Rubio statement on Rudy Giuliani is just about perfect\u201d gushes the Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake regarding the senator\u2019s statement to WPBF in West Palm Beach after he took an Everglades air tour: \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in a position to have to answer for every person in my party that makes a claim. Democrats aren\u2019t asked to answer every time Joe Biden says something embarrassing, so I don\u2019t know why I should answer every time a Republican does. I\u2019ll suffice it to say that I believe the President loves America; I think his ideas are bad.\u201d http://wapo.st/1B0twJG\n\nFAMILY JEWELS: \u201cDocuments show the expensive tastes of Jeb Bush\u2019s low-key wife,\u201d by the Washington Post's Karen Tumulty and Alice Crites: \u201cIn 1999, Columba Bush, the famously private wife of then-Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, was detained and fined by federal customs officials for misrepresenting the amount of clothing and jewelry she had bought while on a solo five-day shopping spree in Paris\u2026 That purchase was part of a pattern by Columba Bush of borrowing to buy tens of thousands of dollars of jewelry at a time from the South Florida store over a 14-year period. Documentation available online, which does not include the details of two transactions made less than six weeks apart in 1995, shows that she spent a total of more than $90,000 at the store.\u201d http://wapo.st/17oAjRi\n\nA softer Columba profile was written by the New York Times\u2019 Patrick Healy and Sheryl Gay Stolberg in \u201cBush Spouse Backs Jeb, but Is Wary of Family Business\u201d http://nyti.ms/1AkrNy9\n\n\u201cJeb Bush's private investments in fracking dovetail with public advocacy,\u201d by The Tampa Bay Times\u2019 Adam C. Smith and Alex Leary: \u201cIn the summer of 2013, well before he became an all-but-declared presidential candidate, Jeb Bush spoke to conservatives gathered in New York. \u2018Some states, like yours here in New York, are choosing not to grow. They won't approve fracking,\u2019 Bush said\u2026. Bush left unmentioned that fracking in the Marcellus Shale beneath the New York-Pennsylvania border also presented a big opportunity for himself.\u201d http://bit.ly/1DLAhQ3\n\n\u201cWHO\u2019S WINNING THE GOP\u2019S 2016 RICK SCOTT PRIMARY?\u201d the Palm Beach Post\u2019s George Bennett asks but doesn\u2019t answer in this piece http://pbpo.st/17KIgAp\n\n\u201cRick Scott will 'most likely' endorse before Fla.

Most said they\u2019re in a wait-and-see zone\u2026 \u2018This is a federal program, it\u2019s a federal problem,\u2019 [Rick Scott] said at the American Action Forum on Friday.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet Florida has 1.6 million people enrolled in Obamacare plans, more than any other state, including California and New York, which run their own exchanges and have governors who back Obamacare. Nine in 10 of those Floridians get subsidies. Scott declined to answer questions about whether he\u2019d share in the blame if the newly covered became uncovered.\u201d http://politi.co/1LsJ6ip\n\n$441,938,000 That\u2019s the total value of Obamacare subsidies in Florida, The Washington Post\u2019s liberal blogger, Greg Sargent points out, making Florida the number-one subsidy state with the most to lose http://wapo.st/180E94a\n\nJOHN HOLDER, JANET RENO RIPPED IN SOUTH FLORIDA \u2013 \u201cRipping off your refunds: South Florida\u2019s booming tax fraud racket,\u201d by the Miami Herald\u2019s Jay Weaver, who writes: \u201cFormer U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, a Miami resident, and current Attorney General Eric Holder both have been victims of tax fraud in South Florida, according to law enforcement sources. In Holder\u2019s case, perpetrators were suspected of filing a phony tax return in his name and using a refund-loaded debit card to withdraw money at local ATM machines.\u201d http://hrld.us/1zZoh7H\n\nHUH: \u201cBill Seeks to End Heterosexual Discrimination in Florida,\u201d by The New Times\u2019 Kyle Munzenrieder: \u201cIt's been technically illegal in Florida since the late 1800s for unrelated and unmarried man and woman to cohabitate. In fact, it's considered \"lewd and lascivious behavior,\" and is punishable as a second-degree misdemeanor. Of course, no one has been prosecuted under the law... Well, Democratic state Senator Eleanor Sobel is finally trying to change that.\u201d http://bit.ly/1D0NmRF\n\nREP. JENNIFER SULLIVAN makes the Huffington Post\u2019s \u201cMeet The 12 Youngest Legislators In America (That We Could Find)\u201d by Jess Rifkin: \u201cSome young legislators may represent comparatively small constituencies in less-populated states. But that's not Sullivan's experience: Her Florida district totals more than 170,000 residents. \u2018As someone entering this process, you have to prove yourself,\" the 23-year-old Republican said, \u2018but that\u2019s true at any age.\u2019\u201d http://huff.to/1BCXi8K\n\n\u201cABSENTEE VOTING FROM THE GRAVE? Fla. Has 158-Year-Old on Voter Rolls\u201d The Lakeland Ledger\u2019s Lloyd Dunkelberger writes: \u201cIt's uncertain whether she voted in the last election. However, her registration is an example of the inaccuracies that can be found in the election records in a state with 12.9 million voters. The good news: Her birthdate of April 18, 1856, is the type of anomaly that is growing rarer in Florida voting records. But inaccuracies persist and remain a sensitive topic in state that decided a presidential election by 537 votes.\u201d http://bit.ly/1D0S7uv\n\nWELCOME BACK NORDBY -- Dan Nordby returns to become the Republican Party of Florida's legal counsel, The Tampa Bay Times' Michael Auslen reports http://bit.ly/1D0TucC\n\nWOOF! \u201cBills would cover medical bills of retired police K9s\u201d by The Palm Beach Post\u2019s Christine Stapleton http://pbpo.st/1vZMvy0\n\nMUST BE COLD IN DC -- President Obama will visit Miami Wednesday for an immigration town-hall style meeting at Florida International University's hosted by Miami-based Telemundo and MSNBC anchor Jos\u00e9 D\u00edaz-Balart.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Sugar wars; medical marijuana and Wasserman Schultz; Bush-fracked and jeweled; Marco heckled; Obama\u2019s Miami migration", "title": "POLITICO\u2019S Florida Playbook: Sugar wars; medical marijuana and Wasserman Schultz; Bush-fracked and jeweled; Marco heckled; Obama\u2019s Miami migration", "url": "http://www.politico.com/floridaplaybook/0215/floridaplaybook17201.html", "image": "http://static.politico.com/c3/1d/8aeea8d14d55b063a272bfc24206/caputo.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Sugar wars; medical marijuana and Wasserman Schultz; Bush-fracked and jeweled; Marco heckled; Obama\u2019s Miami migration", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9309\"", "article_summary": "POLITICO\u2019S Florida Playbook: Sugar wars; medical marijuana and Wasserman Schultz; Bush-fracked and jeweled; Marco heckled; Obama\u2019s Miami migrationBy Marc Caputo (mcaputo@politico.com, @MarcACaputo)GOOD MORNING from Florida Playbook.\nThe campaign highlights a contract U.S. Sugar and the state signed in 2010 under Gov.\nThe good news: Her birthdate of April 18, 1856, is the type of anomaly that is growing rarer in Florida voting records.\n\u201cIt\u2019s now up to Governor Scott and the legislature to tell U.S. Sugar, \u2018a deal is a deal.\u2019\u201d http://bit.ly/1AzujiZThe real winner: consultants, TV stations.\nCharlie Crist, a contract that will expire by the end of the legislative session unless the legislature acts."}
