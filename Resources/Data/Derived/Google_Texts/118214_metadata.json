Currently, five states compel employers to use E-Verify, while 13 other states mandate that their government agencies consult the database when hiring employees.\n\nAll told, many of the more than a half-million employers nationally that use E-Verify do so voluntarily. Yet champions of the verification system want the system made a requirement for all employers. Advocates, such as one of today's columnists, say that E-Verify is a cost-free, speedy, accurate tool for helping to stem the flow of unauthorized immigrants.\n\nE-Verify critics, however, like today's other columnist, dispute that the database is accurate. They argue that the system still has a propensity for errors \u2014 such as flagging authorized candidates \u2014 and a slipshod record of ignoring actual violators. And that makes E-Verify too unreliable a means for making a greater share of potentially life-changing decisions, critics contend.\n\nBy the numbers\n\n\u202223,937,505: total number of E-Verify checks in Fiscal Year 2013.\n\n\u20221,400: average number of new employers adopting E-Verify each week.\n\n\u202298.81: percentage of employees who are automatically confirmed as authorized to work either instantly or within 24 hours.", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "The Front Burner: Should all employers use E-Verify?", "date": "2014-11-26", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "President Obama last week set in motion the most sweeping shift in immigration policy since the Reagan era.", "title": "The Front Burner: Should all employers use E-Verify?", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-ed-everify-front-burner-intro-20141126-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-547663cf/turbine/os-ed-everify-front-burner-intro-20141126", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp12.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "E-Verify, illegal immigrants, undocumented immigrants, work, employers, President Obama, executive", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/82107625", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "E-Verify, illegal immigrants, undocumented immigrants, work, employers, President Obama, executive", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Should all employers use E-Verify asks this Orlando Sentinel Front Burner."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeda0\"", "article_summary": "Currently, five states compel employers to use E-Verify, while 13 other states mandate that their government agencies consult the database when hiring employees.\nStill, Obama's bold stroke does nothing to decide the future of E-Verify, the hiring database created to flag unauthorized immigrants.\n\u20221,400: average number of new employers adopting E-Verify each week.\nAll told, many of the more than a half-million employers nationally that use E-Verify do so voluntarily.\nAdvocates, such as one of today's columnists, say that E-Verify is a cost-free, speedy, accurate tool for helping to stem the flow of unauthorized immigrants."}
