One might be tempted to dismiss the column, but it\u2019s illuminating as an example of the muddy thinking that mars much writing on the topic of inequality, and that has the potential to drive public policy in harmful directions.\n\nRattner\u2019s complaint is that our government doesn\u2019t tax and spend enough to even out the inequality of income. He writes, \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s rarely reported: Before the impact of tax and spending policies is taken into account, income inequality in the United States is no worse than in most developed countries and is even a bit below levels in Britain and, by some measures, Germany. However, once the effect of government programs is included in the calculations, the United States emerges on top of the inequality heap.\u201d\n\nRattner backs up that claim with a chart headlined \u201cDoing Less to Redistribute Income\u201d: \u201cThe U.S. ranks favorably in the Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality, until taxes and transfers are factored in. Then, among these countries, it is the worst.\u201d\n\nBecause it measures income rather than wealth, the Gini coefficient is a flawed measure, as even anti-equality crusader Thomas Piketty concedes. For example, someone who retired early and lives in a mortgage-free house may show up as low income, but have plenty of wealth.\n\nEven using the flawed measure, though, Rattner\u2019s claim that the United States is \u201con top of the inequality heap\u201d when post-transfer, post-tax income is counted turns out to be false. A Gini coefficient of one means that one person has all the income and everyone else has none. A Gini coefficient of zero would mean everyone has exactly the same amount of income. In 2012, the most recent year for which the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has statistics, the post-tax, post-transfer Gini coefficient for the United States was 0.389. For Mexico, it was 0.482. For Chile, in 2011, the number was 0.503. For Turkey in 2011, it was 0.412. Those numbers do not place the U.S. at the \u201ctop of the inequality heap,\u201d as Rattner incorrectly claims.\n\nRattner goes on, \u201cThat\u2019s because our taxes, while progressive, are low by international standards and our social welfare programs \u2014 ranging from unemployment benefits to disability insurance to retirement payments\u2014are consequently less generous.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s quite a logical leap. A country might have high taxes but choose to spend money on corporate subsidies or the military rather than on social welfare programs. Or a country might spend money on social welfare programs\u2014like health benefits and pensions for relatively well-off seniors\u2014that exacerbate inequality rather than ameliorating it. Or a country might have low taxes but spend extravagantly anyway, using money borrowed at low interest rates from other countries (like Russia or China) that have even more inequality.\n\nRattner claims: \u201cConservatives may bemoan the size of our government; in reality, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, total tax revenues in the United States this year will be smaller on a relative basis than those of any other member country.\u201d I\u2019m not sure how Rattner or the OECD can know now what our tax revenues or those of other countries this year \u201cwill be\u201d\u2014the year isn\u2019t even over yet.\n\nIn the chart that goes along with his article, Rattner alters the \u201cwill be\u201d claim to one, headlined \u201cBottom of the heap,\u201d that claims \u201cU.S. tax revenues, as a percent of G.D.P. are the lowest of O.E.C.D. countries.\u201d Again, he conveniently disregards Chile and Mexico, which, if you actually go look at the OECD data, have lower tax revenues than the U.S. does. I emailed Rattner to ask him about this discrepancy and he didn\u2019t immediately reply.\n\nThe final giveaway that Rattner\u2019s data are, as the headline put it, \u201cunbelievable,\u201d comes in a chart listing the number of \u201cpublic holidays.\u201d America, once again, is at the bottom of the barrel, with zero. Has Rattner not heard of Thanksgiving, Christmas, Labor Day, Memorial Day, or the Fourth of July? Or is his point to try to make sure that even more stores, businesses, and restaurants are closed on those days than already are, or that even more workers are paid for not working on those days than already are? Rattner\u2019s driver must park in a garage, because those New Yorkers who park on the street and have to move their cars for street-cleaning can count fully 40 public holidays, including Diwali, the Asian Lunar New Year, and Idul-Fitr.\n\nThe weakness of Rattner\u2019s data is a clue to what he and many of the other anti-inequality campaigners are up to: using the issue as a cudgel to advance the same old tax-and-spend policies that the left was in favor of long before inequality was rediscovered as a trendy cause.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/11/17/the-lefts-economic-nonsense-about-inequa", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "Former Obama auto czar Steven Rattner uses weak data in attempt to advance tax-and-spend policies favored by the left.", "title": "The Latest Liberal Nonsense About Economic Inequality"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cInequality, Unbelievably, Gets Worse,\u201d is the headline over a\n\ncolumn by Steven Rattner, the former Obama administration auto\ntsar who is identified by The New York Times as \u201ca Wall\nStreet executive and a contributing opinion writer.\u201d\nThe only part of the headline you can believe is the word\n\u201cunbelievably,\u201d which is an admirable\u2014funny, even\u2014example of\ntruth-in-headline writing by the Times.
