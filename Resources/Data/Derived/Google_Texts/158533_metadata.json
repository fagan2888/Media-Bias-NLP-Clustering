But no: I have tickets to \u201cMy Mother Has 4 Noses,\u201d a one-woman musical written and performed by the singer/songwriter Jonatha Brooke about the harrowing years when she saw her mother through the final stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\nIt can\u2019t be funny, I told myself. The tunes might be fabulous \u2014 after all, Ms. Brooke won critics\u2019 praise for setting Woody Guthrie\u2019s journal entries to music. But oh, those monologues about her mother would be unbearable.\n\nHow much better to stay home and cry over doomed romance than inexorable death.\n\nBut off I went to the Duke Theater on 42nd Street for a performance both funny and wrenching, one I suspect would resonate with caregivers everywhere. I met Ms. Brooke later for a conversation about her mother and the events described on stage. Lanky in the jeans and flannel shirt she wears during performances, her long hair tied loosely back, she could have been any of us with little time for glamour.\n\nAmong the more than 15 million Americans providing unpaid care for family and friends with Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias, at least three \u2013 Ms. Brooke, 50; her manager/director/husband, Patrick Rains, 64; and his sister, Julie, 60, underemployed and \u201ccouch surfing\u201d \u2013 managed to find endless humor in a family crisis that unfolded from 2010 to 2012, as Ms. Brooke\u2019s mother descended deeper into Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nMs. Brooke had a lifetime of practice dealing with her mother, whose florid wackiness and succession of illnesses, long before Alzheimer\u2019s, would have sent most children running for the hills. Instead the two were linked, said Ms. Brooke, as if there were \u201can electrical current running between us.\u201d\n\nShe was one of three children \u2014 the youngest, the only girl and the lone skeptic in a devout family of Christian Scientists in Boston. The language of the religion, its lessons and allegiances, \u201cnever leave you once you\u2019ve been indoctrinated,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Brooke said.\n\nThose four noses, it turns out, are the collected prostheses her mother, Darren Stone Nelson, wore after untreated skin cancer had turned her into a \u201cmaxillofacial work of art,\u201d as Ms. Brooke put it. The cure for what ailed her mother, in the Christian Science view, was Mary Baker Eddy\u2019s unwavering belief that divine love \u201calways will meet every human need.\u201d\n\nThe same was true when Mrs. Nelson had a uterine tumor. By comparison, her terrible arthritis seemed a mere inconvenience.\n\n\u201cMom was a magical thinker,\u201d Ms. Brooke said. \u201cSo I was burdened with reality.\u201d\n\nIf the material world were an illusion, as she was taught, then so is sickness and death. Ms. Brooke took her first Advil at 30. She has attended just one funeral, her father-in-law\u2019s.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s understandable that dementia didn\u2019t occur to Ms. Brooke as an explanation for her mother\u2019s increasingly erratic behavior until she was well down the road. This was a woman who found a rainbow wig in the town dump and wore it constantly when her daughter was an easily embarrassed seventh grader. It was the postman who hesitantly suggested that Mrs. Nelson didn\u2019t belong alone at home anymore.\n\nAn independent or assisted living facility seemed the solution, as it does to so many of us. Ms. Brooke quickly settled her mother into a home for aged Christian Scientists in Massachusetts. She visited, dined with her mother\u2019s new friends, each with more grievously untreated maladies than the next. \u201cMental malpractice,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Brooke calls it now.\n\nMrs. Nelson\u2019s hygiene was wanting, a common Alzheimer\u2019s symptom, and the staff let her get away with excuses rather than insisting she shower. \u201cNow isn\u2019t a good time,\u201d she\u2019d say. Or \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of something.\u201d Ms. Brooke eventually realized that \u201chymns three times a week is not going to cut it.\u2019\u2019\n\nTerrified and ignorant, but determined and mindful, she said, that \u201cI\u2019m my mother\u2019s only daughter,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Brooke brought her to New York City. Home was, and remains, Apartment 7K in a rental building on upper (waaaaaaay upper) Fifth Avenue. Ms. Brooke rented an apartment on the third floor and moved her mother there. \u201cI could see her window from my living room,\u2019\u2019 she said.\n\nTheir first enormous challenge, as Ms. Brooke describes it in the play, was dealing with her mother\u2019s painful, unrelenting constipation. Once, just \u2018\u2018clipping her toenails creeped me out.\u2019\u2019 Now, it was suppositories and enemas \u2014 and \u201cpoetry in this terrible intimacy,\u2019\u2019 a transition many caregivers will recognize. Before long, Mrs. Nelson \u201cbecame the crazy lady screaming down the hall.\u2019\u2019\n\nVideo\n\nHoping to relieve her mother\u2019s excruciating arthritic pain, Ms. Brooke agreed to have her undergo a knee replacement. There was not a word of warning from doctors that this wasn\u2019t a great idea for a woman too cognitively impaired for physical therapy. After surgery, Mrs. Nelson hallucinated for a week, Ms. Brooke recalled, and attempts at rehabilitation were like scenes from \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u2019\u2019 Within months of the ill-advised operation, a hospice team joined the crowd in Mrs. Nelson\u2019s apartment.\n\nStill this hardy woman lingered, from hospice\u2019s arrival in October until the next January. On a Saturday night, the nurses said her mother was \u201cactively dying,\u2019\u2019 common end-of-life parlance but alien vocabulary to a Christian Scientist. Ms. Brooke longed for her brothers, \u201clovely, beautiful men.\u201d But they were too steeped in their religion, she said, for a deathbed vigil.\n\nMrs. Nelson\u2019s caretakers read her Mary Baker Eddy\u2019s version of the 23rd Psalm. They watched Christian Science church services online. \u201cWe really tried to speak the language, honor the lessons,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Brooke said, but religion seemed to have lost her power, and her mother seemed more enamored of Chanel No. 5, her favorite perfume, which her daughter sprayed in the air.\n\nMonday became Tuesday. Mrs. Nelson\u2019s breathing was thready. When her time came, \u201cshe really did just slip away,\u201d Ms. Brooke said.\n\nWaiting for the undertaker, Ms. Brooke, her husband and sister-in-law, and the caregivers sang sublime hymns and ridiculous ditties like \u201cHow Much Is That Doggie in the Window.\u2019\u2019 A man arrived with a black body bag, loaded it, disinfected his hands, rode down to the lobby and pushed the gurney down Fifth Avenue to his van.\n\nThe gurney fit easily in the elevator, Ms. Brooke said, because long ago the apartment building had been a nursing home. That detail is not in the performance, but, Ms. Brooke said, \u201cthe irony isn\u2019t lost on me.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"ptime": 20140305150106, "BN": "newoldage", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "newoldage", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/newoldage/post", "DISPLAYDATE": "March 5, 2014", "keywords": "Arts & Culture", "GBLC": "Arts & Culture", "communityAssetTaxonomy": "blogs/newoldage/Music Born of Magical Thinking ( 20140305 )", "PT": "Blogs", "author": "Jane Gross", "SCG": "newoldage", "sourceApp": "blogs", "CLMST": "Jane Gross", "byl": "Jane Gross", "twitter": {"description": "Jonatha Brooke talks about her mother\u2019s descent into Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the basis of her one-woman show, \u201cMy Mother Has 4 Noses.\u201d", "title": "Music Born of Magical Thinking", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/music-born-of-magical-thinking/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/03/05/health/brooke_noa/brooke_noa-thumbLarge.jpg", "site": "@TheNewOldAge", "card": "summary"}, "blogpostid": 100000002751987, "description": "Jonatha Brooke talks about her mother\u2019s descent into Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the basis of her one-woman show, \u201cMy Mother Has 4 Noses.\u201d", "robots": "noodp", "dat": "March 5, 2014", "article": {"tag": "Arts & Culture", "published_time": 1394049666, "collection": "http://json8.nytimes.com/services/json/sectionfronts/health/index.jsonp", "modified_time": "2014-03-27T13:11:39-04:00"}, "utime": 20140327131139, "communityAssetLabels": "NYT_Blogs", "PUD": 20140305, "pdate": 20140305, "thumbnail": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/03/05/health/brooke_noa/brooke_noa-thumbLarge.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "The New Old Age Blog", "description": "Jonatha Brooke talks about her mother\u2019s descent into Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the basis of her one-woman show, \u201cMy Mother Has 4 Noses.\u201d", "title": "Music Born of Magical Thinking", "url": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/music-born-of-magical-thinking/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/03/05/health/brooke_noa/brooke_noa-videoSixteenByNine600.jpg", "type": "article"}, "communityAssetURL": "http://newoldage.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/music-born-of-magical-thinking/", "PUV": "normal", "hdl": "Music Born of Magical Thinking", "thumbnail_150": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/03/05/health/brooke_noa/brooke_noa-thumbLarge.jpg", "PST": "Blog Post"}, "article_summary": "The tunes might be fabulous \u2014 after all, Ms. Brooke won critics\u2019 praise for setting Woody Guthrie\u2019s journal entries to music.\nThe language of the religion, its lessons and allegiances, \u201cnever leave you once you\u2019ve been indoctrinated,\u2019\u2019 Ms. Brooke said.\nThat detail is not in the performance, but, Ms. Brooke said, \u201cthe irony isn\u2019t lost on me.\u201d\n\u201cMom was a magical thinker,\u201d Ms. Brooke said.\nMs. Brooke longed for her brothers, \u201clovely, beautiful men.\u201d But they were too steeped in their religion, she said, for a deathbed vigil."}
