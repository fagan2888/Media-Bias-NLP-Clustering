Photo: Getty Images\n\nA year from now, basketballer Anthony Drmic could be anywhere.\n\nThis week he is at the Australian Boomers training camp in Perth and later this year he will begin his senior (final) year at Boise State University in Idaho.\n\nBut once his college career is finished, Drmic is expected to have options in the NBA or Europe, where he is in the process of getting a Croatian passport, enabling him to play as a local.\n\nThe 22-year-old former Dandenong Ranger player said it would all come down to how well he performs in the next year, but considering he is a 198-centimetre guard with a great three-point shot, no one is ruling out the possibility he could follow Matt Dellavedova or Patty Mills and make the NBA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou always look a little bit forward but it all comes down to what kind of senior year I have,\u201d Drmic said.\n\n\"I\u2019m really putting everything I can into preparing for that and seeing what I can do. Everything is on the table for me, it really depends on how I play next season.\n\n\u201cI want to see how far I can take it and whatever opportunities come up be it NBA, Europe or NBL, then I will go from there.\u201d\n\nAt the Boomers camp, Drmic will play under the watchful eye of coach Andrej Lemanis as the Boomers prepare for their annual four-game Sino Series against China.\n\nIt\u2019s the second time Drmic has been called into the series, which usually includes \u201csecond-string\u201d Boomers from the NBL and US colleges as well as available European players.\n\nDrmic is at long odds to make the Boomers for the FIBA basketball world cup in Spain this year but hopes to work his way into the group in future.\n\n\u201cThe Boomers are my number one priority on this trip home and I want to see how far I can take it,\u201d Drmic said.\n\nAnthony is not the only Drmic in Australian basketball. His older brother Frank starred with South East Melbourne Magic, Victoria Titans, Sydney Kings and South Dragons in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nFrank played three seasons in Europe and won a gold medal with Australia at the under-23 world championships in Melbourne in 1997\n\nThere is 14 years between the two brothers but they share a close bond.\n\nFrank spoke to The Sunday Age on the condition the article was \"all about Anthony\u201d but the story wouldn\u2019t be complete without letting people know about the older Drmic. Now 36, he works at Baron Forge in Brooklyn in the western suburbs as a supervisor and is the father of four girls.\n\nFor big brother, seeing Anthony on the verge of professional basketball brings a feeling of \u201cextreme pride\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s come full circle,\u201d Frank said. \u201cI now realise what my family went through with my career, you don\u2019t realise how much it affects the family. I haven\u2019t been to Boise to see him but it\u2019s easy to follow him over the internet and on games shown on ESPN here. I used to get him T-shirts and shoes, now he is looking after his big brother.\u201d\n\nWhen Frank was starring in the NBL, he knew then his baby brother would follow in his footsteps.\n\n\u201cHe was always going to play basketball \u2013 I still remember him running around as a little kid at my games so I\u2019ll take some credit for his love of basketball \u2013 he makes us all really proud,\u201d Frank said.\n\nAnthony agreed, although his memories of those years are not exclusively of his big brother. Frank was part of Ian Stacker\u2019s Australian under-23 side at Melbourne Park in 1997.\n\n\u201cI remember it, Aaron Trahair hitting a game-winner in one of those matches \u2013 they were all great,\u201d Anthony said.\n\nThe two brothers are very different players. Frank was a tall, burly, versatile guard who played in the NBL from his teenage years, and could use is strength to play in the low post.\n\nHe described Anthony as \u201ca little sleeker\u201d, a scorer with an enviable three-point shot - which big brother would have loved to have. Anthony led Boise State in scoring last season, even when a stress fracture in his foot and a twisted ankle cut a chunk out of his season.\n\nAnthony is proud that he retains his Australian accent despite three years in Boise, where retired NBL star John Rillie is an assistant coach. \u201cIt\u2019s literally because [fellow Australians] Igor Hadziomerovic and Nick Duncan and John are with me,\u201d Anthony said. \u201cWe are keeping a little bit of Australia in Boise.\u201d\n\nIn the years ahead Drmic will keep his family name in basketball.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "Basketball", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "A year from now basketballer Anthony Drmic could be anywhere.", "title": "With basketball in his blood, Anthony Drmic aims for Boomers and beyond", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/sport/basketball/with-basketball-in-his-blood-anthony-drmic-aims-for-boomers-and-beyond-20140524-zrn4o.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/8/v/s/9/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.zrn4o.png/1400923084787.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/8/v/s/9/image.related.thumbnail.320x214.zrn4o.png/1400923084787.jpg"}, "description": "A year from now basketballer Anthony Drmic could be anywhere.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "With basketball in his blood, Anthony Drmic aims for Boomers and beyond"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "A year from now basketballer Anthony Drmic could be anywhere."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1fc\"", "article_summary": "Photo: Getty ImagesA year from now, basketballer Anthony Drmic could be anywhere.\nBest option: Anthony Drmic in action in Idaho.\nHis older brother Frank starred with South East Melbourne Magic, Victoria Titans, Sydney Kings and South Dragons in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\u201cWe are keeping a little bit of Australia in Boise.\u201dIn the years ahead Drmic will keep his family name in basketball.\nFor big brother, seeing Anthony on the verge of professional basketball brings a feeling of \u201cextreme pride\u201d."}
