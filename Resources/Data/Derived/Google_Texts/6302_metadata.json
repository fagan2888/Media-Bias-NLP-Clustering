Until it isn\u2019t. George of the Jungle can tell you why.\n\nWASHINGTON, April 27, 2015 \u2013 Until recently, Fridays and Mondays used to be pretty gloomy down days for Wall Street stocks. But not lately. Friday trading ended with reasonably decent numbers, and Monday morning\u2019s trading action has a similar look, at least so far. As of approximately 10:40 EDT, the Dow Jones 30 Industrials (DJI) are up 60+ points, with the broader-based S&P 500 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ up 5.34 and 19.85 points respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, the VIX, the widely accepted measure of stock market volatility\u2014i.e., how violently stocks are swinging both up and down\u2014is sitting at a tepid 12 or so, indicating that traders, at least this week, have few if any cares in the world.\n\nAll of this reminds us of today\u2019s trading metaphor, George of the Jungle. Originally created as a short-lived 1967 cartoon character and TV series by \u201cRocky and Bullwinkle\u201d creator Jay Ward and sidekick Bill Scott as a spoof on Edgar Rice Burroughs\u2019 popular Tarzan of the Jungle books (later made into popular adventure films), George later showed up in a 1997 Disney studio film. He popped up again in a direct-to-disk flick (2003), and reappeared once again in animation in 2007.\n\nNotable for its eponymous hero\u2019s overall silliness, lack of brainpower and uncanny ability to smack face-first into large trees when swinging from vine to vine, the various iterations of \u201cGeorge\u201d were not particularly distinctive.\n\nThe Maven still vividly recalls one particular scene from the Jay Ward cartoon series. Menaced by a nasty-looking giant gorilla, George proudly proclaimed to the camera in true Johnny Weissmuller dialect, \u201cGeorge not know meaning of fear\u2026\u201d Whereupon the gorilla commenced to pound George halfway into the ground like a tent stake, prompting George to observe, \u201cbut George could learn.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this character and this pithy passage that\u2019s been bugging the Maven over the past few weeks of relatively patternless trading on Wall Street.\n\nIf the Fed doesn\u2019t start raising interest rates, ISIS and Putin play nice, oil and gas prices remain totally stable, the Greeks choose to obey European Central Bank (ECB) dictates to the letter, and the Supreme Court decides (in June) that President Obama can continue to ad lib Obamacare (ACA) rules and regs as long as Democrats benefit, the VIX is likely to remain low, stocks are likely to remain flat to modestly up.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nWall Street tending its garden of stocks on Earth Day.\n\nThese very big \u201cifs\u201d seem to be distant possibilities for traders right now, meaning that, like George, \u201cTraders not know meaning of fear.\u201d But should any one of these aforementioned swords of Damocles suddenly drop from the sky, traders could learn the meaning of fear, big time and in milliseconds.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what has the Maven worried. An about-face on any of the issues we\u2019ve just noted, or, worse, something terrible that\u2019s entirely unforeseen, could slap the market\u2019s current complacency right off its smug, collective face, leading to a selling panic that may actually be long overdue.\n\nFor that reason, the bulk of the Maven\u2019s rather reduced portfolio is currently invested in commission-free, low management fee ETFs in positive areas at the moment. Unlike individual stocks, broader-based ETFs tend to move more slowly up or down than the averages or individual. (Leveraged issues, of course, are exceptions to the rule.) Otherwise, the Maven\u2019s portfolios are now between 30-45 percent in cash.\n\nToday\u2019s Trading Tips\n\nAs per our observations above, our current ETF holding tends to reflect our somewhat nervous point of view. In a macro sense, the Obama administration has, in eight short years, succeeded entirely in its aim to \u201cfundamentally transform America.\u201d\n\nAside from the numerous issues already raised by this radical disconnect from traditional American policies, one major result of this \u201ctransformation\u201d is an obviously and intentionally weakened United States.\n\nUnlike the America experienced by Baby Boomers throughout their lifetimes\u2014when they lived in a country that could dominate the world\u2019s political and economic theaters\u2014Obama\u2019s U.S. is rapidly approaching a time when its importance and influence is more on a par with rotted out countries like Venezuela.\n\nREAD ALSO: The Supreme Court\u2019s June Obamacare ruling: Bad for stocks?\n\n\n\nLess in control of its destiny than it was even in its early years as an independent country, today\u2019s United States and as its financial markets are no longer as robust and defensible as we customarily think they are. Underpinned by hundreds of billions of phony dollars printed by the U.S. Treasury and handed out to banks and rich political supporters to prop up markets, this massive financial shell game in stocks and bonds can and must change. But when it finally does, neither the U.S. nor its severely weakened European allies will be able to do very much about it.\n\nHence, our rather cosmic seriousness at this point in spring 2015. We\u2019re not nervous enough to be entirely out of the market while loading up on gold or silver instead as some tell us we must. But we are sufficiently worried that American traders\u2014and most certainly, the administration\u2019s water carriers in the network and financial media\u2014are not paying enough attention to the thin ice upon which today\u2019s markets are treading, global warming climate change concerns notwithstanding.\n\nHence, we favor staying in the market to some degree while protecting ourselves by hiding in representative ETFs that may offer a little more downside protection than individual stocks.\n\nA good representative holding, depending on which brokerage you\u2019re working with, might be in one or more ETFs that represent the broad market (like Schwab\u2019s SCHB and SCHX), one or two \u201cgrowth\u201d ETFs (like Schwab\u2019s SCHG), and, perhaps, a broadly based emerging market ETF (like Schwab\u2019s SCHE).\n\nWe\u2019re not pitching Schwab here, BTW\u2014it\u2019s just that the Maven trades through this firm and its representative ETFs are available without commission. You may have a similar situation (but different ETFs) with your brokerage.\n\nWe do continue to hold a few individual stock positions, such as midstream and downstream oil industry players like Calumet (CLMT) and Kinder Morgan (KMI), while taking occasional advantage of decent looking IPOs, like the recent IPO of Party City Holdings (PRTY).\n\nWe also hold a batch of preferred stocks we bought at good discounts, many of which will be \u201ccalled\u201d (redeemed) not too many years hence at a profit for us. But it\u2019s hard to get more aggressive in this market.\n\nWhen everyone is as nervous as the Maven is right now, stocks actually tend to move up, \u201cclimbing a wall of worry\u201d as the old adage goes.\n\nBut when nobody seems nervous at all, save for the relatively few quiet professionals who\u2019ve been exiting stocks without saying so since January, that\u2019s a negative sign to the Maven, who firmly believes that \u201ceverybody\u201d is always wrong.\n\nHappy and safe investing to all. And we\u2019ll see you again tomorrow for another reading of the tea leaves at the bottom of 2015\u2019s very murky cup.", "article_metadata": {"description": "VIX low, averages melt higher, all\u2019s right with the world of Wall Street.
