But Republican policy analyst Douglas Holtz-Eakin thinks the time will come when his party will stop trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act and Democrats will start trying to fix it.\n\nWhen that day arrives, both sides will need help charting a path through the health policy wilderness. So Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, this week opened the virtual doors of a new think tank known as the Center for Health and Economy.\n\nUnlike your average think tank, the center is not dedicated to developing its own policy prescriptions. Instead, it is intended to help lawmakers, members of the media and the public assess ideas put forward by others.\n\n\u201cI think the Affordable Care Act is the beginning of health reform, not the end,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be talking about this for the foreseeable future, and it\u2019s important to inform that debate.\u201d\n\nThe center aims to be nonpartisan, and Holtz-Eakin has assembled an impressive board of academics, including Mark Pauly from the Wharton School of Business, known as the father of the individual mandate, and Princeton\u2019s Uwe Reinhardt. But for now, at least, the center relies on a start-up grant from the American Action Forum, Holtz-Eakin\u2019s very partisan employer.\n\nHoltz-Eakin, who worked in the George W. Bush White House and advised 2008 presidential candidate Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), acknowledged that conservative bias is \u201ca fair concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut frankly, it\u2019s a concern I faced when I went from the White House to CBO, so I\u2019ve been through this territory before,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have the institution set up so it can be nonideological. And in the end, the quality of the work solves the problem.\u201d\n\nSo far, Democrats may have cause to question the center\u2019s political leanings. Its Web site features a critical analysis of the ACA that challenges the CBO\u2019s conclusion that the law will reduce federal budget deficits. But over time, Holtz-Eakin hopes it will gain a reputation for fair analyses of proposals from both parties, with a special focus on the impact on health premiums and efficiency of care.\n\n\u201cA realistic assessment is that a durable, successful health care reform will be bipartisan in nature. And that means it will include some things that are in the Affordable Care Act. I see no way around that,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said.\n\n\u201cPlus,\u201d he said, \u201cnot everything in it is terrible.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "\u201cI think the Affordable Care Act is the beginning of health reform, not the end.\u201d", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "\u201cI think the Affordable Care Act is the beginning of health reform, not the end.\u201d", "title": "Doug Holtz-Eakin is starting a new health-care think tank", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/01/15/new-think-tank-focused-on-health-policy/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2012/12/PH2008101401107.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@loriamontgomery"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/01/15/new-think-tank-focused-on-health-policy/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI think the Affordable Care Act is the beginning of health reform, not the end,\u201d Holtz-Eakin said in an interview.\nWhen that day arrives, both sides will need help charting a path through the health policy wilderness.\nAnd that means it will include some things that are in the Affordable Care Act.\nThe politics of health care may, for the moment, be mired in gridlock.\n\u201cA realistic assessment is that a durable, successful health care reform will be bipartisan in nature."}
