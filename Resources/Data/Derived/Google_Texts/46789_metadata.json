Father Serra embodied the Catholic Church\u2019s institutional disrespect for Native Peoples\u2019 religions, sovereignty, families, languages, laws, treaties, boundaries, ways and lives, and should not be elevated to sainthood for his actions.\n\nThe \u201cpagan,\u201d \u201cheathen\u201d and \u201csavage\u201d epithets of Doctrine of Discovery and the Papal Bulls made their way into the American lexicon about Native Peoples in history, education, literature and journalism, and were included in the Declaration of Independence, in the federal \u201cCivilization Regulations\u201d that subjugated Native Peoples for more than a half-century from the 1880s to the 1930s, and in recent Supreme Court decisions upholding misappropriations of land, gold and other Native property by non-Native persons, corporations and governments.\n\nFather Serra carried out injustices and atrocities against Native Peoples in California, but all Native Peoples feel his cruelties, just as Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer did not murder and maim people of every Native Nation, but all Native Peoples recognize his war crimes. Their brutalities are so symbolic as to be substantive.\n\nFather Serra\u2019s canonization is a symbol that reverberates through time as anti-Indian. Pope Francis recently asked Native Peoples in Bolivia for forgiveness, \u201cnot only for the offenses of the Church herself, but also for the crimes committed against the Native Peoples during the so-called conquest of America.\u201d It is incomprehensible that the Pope could apologize for such crimes, yet confer sainthood on a leading perpetrator of those very crimes.\n\nLikewise, it defies understanding that Pope Francis would apologize for past destruction of Native Peoples caused by the Catholic Church, yet leave in place the very documents that justify and make it possible for criminal assaults to continue against Native Peoples today.\n\nWe entreat Pope Francis to rescind the anti-Indian Papal Bulls and Doctrine of Discovery, and to reverse the canonization of Father Junipero Serra.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Suzan Shown Harjo statement to Pope Francis: Rescind the anti-Indian Papal Bulls and Doctrine of Discovery, and reverse Junipero Serra's canonization.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "theresa", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/09/21/suzan-shown-harjo-pope-francis-dont-canonize-junipero-serra-161825", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/harjo_obama_freedom_medal.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "Suzan Shown Harjo to Pope Francis: Don't Canonize  Jun\u00edpero Serra"}, "abstract": "Suzan Shown Harjo statement to Pope Francis: Rescind the anti-Indian Papal Bulls and Doctrine of Discovery, and reverse Junipero Serra's canonization.", "keywords": "Suzan Shown Harjo, Pope Francis, Junipero Serra, Catholic Saint, Canonization, Catholic Church, Morning Star Institute", "dc": {"title": "Suzan Shown Harjo to Pope Francis: Don't Canonize  Jun\u00edpero Serra"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2015/09/21/suzan-shown-harjo-pope-francis-dont-canonize-junipero-serra-161825", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "robots": "follow, index", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 2}, "dcterms.date": "2015-09-21T11:50-04:00", "dcterms.title": "Suzan Shown Harjo to Pope Francis: Don't Canonize  Jun\u00edpero Serra"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd0d7\"", "article_summary": "We entreat Pope Francis to rescind the anti-Indian Papal Bulls and Doctrine of Discovery, and to reverse the canonization of Father Junipero Serra.\nFather Serra carried out injustices and atrocities against Native Peoples in California, but all Native Peoples feel his cruelties, just as Lt.
