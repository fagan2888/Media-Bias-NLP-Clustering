Bush\u2019s vice president, had as much influence as anyone in shaping post-9/11 foreign policy and war strategy in Afghanistan and Iraq. He accused Obama of forfeiting America\u2019s role as leader of the free world and significantly diminishing U.S. power just as the threat of terrorism from ISIS and others is rapidly growing around the globe.\n\nRelated: Two anti-torture protesters arrested at Dick Cheney's house\n\nBush has always praised his former vice president, despite Cheney\u2019s well-documented mistakes in helping to thrust the U.S. into a senseless war in Iraq based on faulty intelligence and his unwavering support of the CIA\u2019s harsh interrogation techniques on enemy combatants and terrorism suspects. What few people knew until now is that Bush\u2019s father, former President George H.W. Bush, had long harbored deep grievances against Cheney and other cabinet members during his son\u2019s eight-year administration.\n\nPeter Baker of The New York Times obtained an advanced copy a new biography of the elder Bush by John Meacham, Destiny and Power: The American Odyssey of George Herbert Walker Bush. In it, Bush said that Cheney had built \u201chis own empire\u201d and exercised too much \u201chardline\u201d influence in pressing for the use of force around the world. W\u2019s father chided his son for giving Cheney and Rumsfeld too much free reign after the 9/11 attacks, although he continued to praise his son\u2019s overall performance as president.\n\nHe also criticized Bush II for being at times \u201ctoo bellicose in his language.\u201d\n\nThe senior Bush, the 41st president, waged the first Gulf War against Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein between August 1990 and February 1991. While the U.S. and its allies prevailed in the war, Bush wisely chose not to invade and occupy Iraq. He called Rumsfeld, an unabashed champion of the subsequent invasion of Iraq, \u201can arrogant fellow\u201d who \u201cserved the president badly.\u201d But he reserved his toughest criticism for Cheney, who in many ways was the driving force behind U.S. military action in Afghanistan and Iraq that ultimately resulted in 5,269 combat deaths, many more seriously wounded military personnel, and an estimated $1.5 trillion of defense spending since 2001.\n\nRelated: Dick Cheney: Build Up the Military, Get Aggressive Overseas\n\nHere are a few of the more dramatic quotes by George H.W. Bush in Meacham\u2019s book:\n\n\u201cHe had his own empire there and marched to his own drummer,\u201d the senior Bush said of Cheney. \u201cIt just showed me that you cannot do it that way. The president should not have that worry.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe just became very hardline and very different from the Dick Cheney I knew and worked with.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust iron-ass. His seeming knuckling under to the real hard-charging guys who want to fight about everything, use force to get our way in the Middle East.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve concluded that Lynne Cheney is a lot of the eminence grise here \u2013 iron-ass, tough as nails, driving.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe big mistake that was made was letting Cheney bring in kind of his own State Department.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think they overdid that [defense strategy]. But it\u2019s not Cheney\u2019s fault. It\u2019s the president\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\nIn a post-script to The New York Times report, George W. Bush stuck up both Cheney and Rumsfeld. \u201cI am proud to have served with Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI am grateful to both men for their good advice, selfless service to our country, and friendship.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It wasn\u2019t long ago that former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, Liz, were", "title": "Bush I Says Cheney and Rumsfeld Pushed the U.S. Into War in Iraq and Afghanistan", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/05/Bush-I-Says-Cheney-and-Rumsfeld-Pushed-US-War-Iraq-and-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06242010_bush2_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/11/05/Bush-I-Says-Cheney-and-Rumsfeld-Pushed-US-War-Iraq-and-Afghanistan", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/06242010_bush2_article.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "It wasn\u2019t long ago that former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, Liz, were", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "While the U.S. and its allies prevailed in the war, Bush wisely chose not to invade and occupy Iraq.\n\u201cI am proud to have served with Dick Cheney and Don Rumsfeld,\u201d he said in a statement.\nIt\u2019s the president\u2019s fault.\u201dIn a post-script to The New York Times report, George W.
