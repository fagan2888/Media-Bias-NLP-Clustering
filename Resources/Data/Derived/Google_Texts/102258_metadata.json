He has been finishing up his latest project, \"The Roosevelts,\" a 14-hour film focusing on the trio of Teddy, Franklin Delano and Eleanor that will air in September.\n\n[READ: No, the U.S. Doesn't Have the Best Health Care System in the World]\n\nIn Washington this week, Burns reminded an audience that FDR tussled with Congress quite a bit to get signature legislation passed. \u201cSocial Security, when we think of the muscular leadership of FDR, it just squeaks by completely, eaten by the left and the right, so that it becomes a kind of passive middle ground,\u201d Burns said. The man behind \"The Civil War\" and \"The National Parks: America's Best Idea,\" explained that Social Security's passage was looked at then as moving the country a couple of steps forward, while today it's considered a big deal.\n\n\u201cSo if you are worried about campaigning on the ACA, we may be looking at the ACA in 25 years as one of the great pieces of social legislation,\u201d Burns continued, adding that passing health care legislation was something that neither Teddy Roosevelt nor Franklin Roosevelt was able to accomplish.\n\nWithout mentioning him by name, Burns also noted how the modern political era \u2013 of politicians running against the government \u2013 began with Ronald Reagan. \u201cLet\u2019s just be very clear that up until 1980, every debate in a presidential election was one candidate saying, \u2018My version of government is better than yours and here\u2019s why,\u2019\u201d Burns said. \u201cAnd for the first time in U.S. history, a major candidate ran against government itself \u2013 and so opened the door, let the genie out of the bottle, for an amazing transformation of American society.\u201d\n\n[ALSO: Discrepancies Plague More Than 2 Million Affordable Care Act Health Care Recipients]\n\nNow, Burns said that he encounters government students quite often who believe that the American government is a force for ill.\n\n\u201cAnd I would argue that in the history of humankind, I don\u2019t know a greater force for good than the United States government,\u201d Burns said. \u201cNow don\u2019t get me wrong, I believe it has made billions of mistakes and has done major things, but against any other major institution over the course of the last 250 years, its record is incredible.\u201d\n\nBurns then ticked off 16 major victories that the founders of the country and the U.S. government have achieved: \u201cThe Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Emancipation Proclamation, the Land Grant College Act, the Homestead Act, national parks, public education, antitrust laws, Social Security, a National Labor Relations Act, [the] Glass-Steagall [Act], the G.I. Bill, interstate highways, the man on the moon, the ACA.\"\n\n\u201cThis is an incredibly positive thing to run on if you\u2019re a government.\u201d\n\n", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Ken Burns: Go Ahead, Campaign on the Affordable Care Act", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "It will likely go down in history as 'one of the great pieces of social legislation,' the documentary filmmaker said.", "title": "Ken Burns: Go Ahead, Campaign on the Affordable Care Act", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/washington-whispers/2014/06/11/ken-burns-go-ahead-campaign-on-the-affordable-care-act", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/08/70/34d0f72f45c0ad0d1214489a5334/140611-kenburns-editorial.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Ken Burns: Go Ahead, Campaign on the Affordable Care Act", "description": "It will likely go down in history as 'one of the great pieces of social legislation,' the documentary filmmaker said.", "card": "summary", "site": "@USNews"}, "site": "news", "date_published": "June 11, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Nikki Schwab,Pulse,picks,Roosevelt, Franklin Delano,movies,Washington Whispers [News]", "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "It will likely go down in history as 'one of the great pieces of social legislation,' the documentary filmmaker said."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1ab2\"", "article_summary": "History might look kindly, very kindly, on the Affordable Care Act, according to documentary filmmaker Ken Burns.\nDoesn't Have the Best Health Care System in the World]In Washington this week, Burns reminded an audience that FDR tussled with Congress quite a bit to get signature legislation passed.\nWithout mentioning him by name, Burns also noted how the modern political era \u2013 of politicians running against the government \u2013 began with Ronald Reagan.\nHe has been finishing up his latest project, \"The Roosevelts,\" a 14-hour film focusing on the trio of Teddy, Franklin Delano and Eleanor that will air in September.\n\u201cSo if you are worried about campaigning on the ACA, we may be looking at the ACA in 25 years as one of the great pieces of social legislation,\u201d Burns continued, adding that passing health care legislation was something that neither Teddy Roosevelt nor Franklin Roosevelt was able to accomplish."}
