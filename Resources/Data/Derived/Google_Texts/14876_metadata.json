View Full Caption DNAinfo/Sam Cholke\n\nBRONZEVILLE \u2014 Oak Street Health unveiled a new clinic for seniors in Bronzeville on Tuesday.\n\nThe clinic at 4318 S. State St. will treat 2,500 patients and is the fourth new clinic opened in the last year by the startup.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to do primary care, preventative medicine,\u201d said Mike Pykosz, CEO of the Chicago-based clinic that opened its first clinic in Edgewater a year ago.\n\nThe clinic has a very clear and simple model: only treat seniors, only provide basic preventative medicine.\n\nPykosz said changes in to the market from the Affordable Care Act opened up a niche for treating Medicare patients and focusing on reducing hospitalization through preventative care.\n\n\u201cThis model was created because there was a need in the community and in the system,\u201d Pykosz said.\n\nHe said the clinic\u2019s patients are 35 percent less likely to end up in the hospital than the average senior and keep showing up for visits because of the focus on friendly staff.\n\nInstead of investing in specialized technicians, Oak Street Health has hired staff to help patients navigate the maze of Medicare and keep them engaged between visits.\n\n\u201cI consider myself a relatively smart person and Medicare should not be this difficult,\u201d said Charise Williams, who organizes exercise classes, computer classes and other activities in the clinic\u2019s community room and has also tried navigating Medicare claims for relatives.\n\nThe clinic currently has one doctor on staff and will soon expand to four physicians and a dentist.\n\nThe Bronzeville location is the fifth location opened by Oak Street Health, which plans to open a sixth location by the end of the year.\n\nFor more neighborhood news, listen to DNAinfo Radio here:", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "description": "Oak Street Health has expanded rapidly in Chicago in the last year providing primary care to seniors.", "application-name": "DNAinfo", "og": {"url": "https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20140923/bronzeville/oak-street-health-finds-niche-focusing-on-bronzeville-seniors-on-medicare", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "https://assets.dnainfo.com/generated/chicago_photo/2014/09/oak-street-clinic-opens-1411506391.jpg/extralarge.jpg", "height": 400}, "site_name": "DNAinfo Chicago", "description": "Oak Street Health has expanded rapidly in Chicago in the last year providing primary care to seniors.", "title": "Oak Street Health Finds Niche Focusing on Bronzeville Seniors on Medicare"}, "referrer": "always", "twitter": {"site": "@DNAinfoCHI", "card": "summary"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "DNAinfo", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-70x70px.png", "robots": "noarchive,noodp,noydir", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-310x150.png", "fb": {"admins": "54902139,1379988119,575522805,108424,5519941,48600120,112261,662865465", "app_id": 153948644632011}, "viewport": "width=device-width", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "Oakland,Bronzeville,Englewood,Health & Wellness,Oak Street Health,Mike Pykosz,Charise Williams", "google-site-verification": "AYA-4dHbK-igtSqpqIYyKuCbHO3o3KourjkrAnfCeZc", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "//fluffyclouds.dnainfo.com/img/common/mstile-150x150.png", "googletag": {"topic": "health-wellness", "tags": "oak-street-health", "people": "mike-pykosz,charise-williams"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca12b\"", "article_summary": "View Full Caption DNAinfo/Sam CholkeBRONZEVILLE \u2014 Oak Street Health unveiled a new clinic for seniors in Bronzeville on Tuesday.\nThe Bronzeville location is the fifth location opened by Oak Street Health, which plans to open a sixth location by the end of the year.\nOak Street Health opened a new location in Bronzeville Tuesday, the most recent location in a rapid expansion of the six clinics in the last year.\nInstead of investing in specialized technicians, Oak Street Health has hired staff to help patients navigate the maze of Medicare and keep them engaged between visits.\nPykosz said changes in to the market from the Affordable Care Act opened up a niche for treating Medicare patients and focusing on reducing hospitalization through preventative care."}
