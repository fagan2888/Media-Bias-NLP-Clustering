LAS VEGAS (AP) - Police say a man allegedly stole a forklift and caused thousands of dollars in damage inside a Las Vegas warehouse.

The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports (http://bit.ly/1VQn8zi) that officers were called around 9:40 a.m. Saturday about a suspect stealing a forklift at PDM Steel Services Center, a supplier of steel products.

Lt. Jeff Goodwin says the suspect had already been on the property for more than an hour, allegedly breaking glass and other materials.

Goodwin says he then refused to come down from the forklift for 30 minutes and began driving toward police.

A SWAT team was called but then canceled after police apprehended him.

The unidentified man is believed to be a current or former employee there.

Goodwin says the damages are estimated to be up to $100,000.
