It currently enrolls 10 new doctors a year in that specialty.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been fortunate to be able to hire a number of those doctors as well for Parkview\u2019s staff,\u201d said Jamie McKinney, a member of the Parkview board.\n\nAnother benefit is those internists-in-training are able to treat the growing number of low-income Medicaid patients that Parkview is seeing because of the federal Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cWithout those residents, many of those Medicaid patients would be coming into the emergency room for care and that is the most expensive way to provide care,\u201d Baxter said.\n\nThe residency clinic treated 10,800 patients last year.\n\nBaxter said it\u2019s vital for Pueblo to maintain its hospitals and a high level of care as an economic anchor for the region.\n\nFor example, he said Parkview has continued to offer hospital treatment for mental health and substance-abuse patients \u2014 a service that isn\u2019t profitable but is essential to a community.\n\n\u201cMany hospitals have stopped treating those patients but it\u2019s not uncommon for us to get a call from Aurora or another city asking if we have room for a patient,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, Parkview maintains a Level II trauma center for severely injured people.\n\nThe hospital now has 50 doctors on its own hospital staff \u2014 a trend that is sweeping the industry as doctors turn away from the high cost of trying to run a private practice.\n\nWhile Parkview is licensed for 350 beds, the hospital also has an emergency room clinic in Pueblo West and has a new partnership with Mt. San Rafael Hospital in Trinidad.\n\nBaxter noted the Pueblo West treatment center sits on 35 acres of land \u2014 signaling where Parkview will probably grow in future expansions.\n\nproper@chieftain.com", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.chieftain.com/news/2751105-120/parkview-hospital-baxter-care", "type": "article", "image": "http://www.chieftain.com/csp/mediapool/sites/dt.common.streams.StreamServer.cls?STREAMOID=8TrEY6jtVLcxRumL0lr7Cc$daE2N3K4ZzOUsqbU5sYuVy5XhYIsflsiHpwSirDxcWCsjLu883Ygn4B49Lvm9bPe2QeMKQdVeZmXF$9l$4uCZ8QDXhaHEp3rvzXRJFdy0KqPHLoMevcTLo3h8xh70Y6N_U_CryOsw6FTOdKL_jpQ-&CONTENTTYPE=image/jpeg", "site_name": "http://www.chieftain.com", "title": "Parkview is area\u2019s largest employer"}, "fb": {"admins": 166812535600, "app_id": 323205824384149}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Chieftain.com"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1727\"", "article_summary": "Noting that Parkview has been highly ranked by U.S. News & World Report magazine for four consecutive years, Baxter said the hospital and its board have focused on building Parkview into a regional hospital center.\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing our best to keep high-technology health care from migrating out of Pueblo to cities up north,\u201d he said.\nBaxter noted the Pueblo West treatment center sits on 35 acres of land \u2014 signaling where Parkview will probably grow in future expansions.\nWhile Parkview is licensed for 350 beds, the hospital also has an emergency room clinic in Pueblo West and has a new partnership with Mt.\nAnother benefit is those internists-in-training are able to treat the growing number of low-income Medicaid patients that Parkview is seeing because of the federal Affordable Care Act."}
