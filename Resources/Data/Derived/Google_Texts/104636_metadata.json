The middle-age professionals both suffered the same symptoms: frequent urination, fatigue, and thirst.\n\n\n\n\"Both were intelligent and well-educated,\" said Ciccotelli, a family physician who also is vice president and chief medical officer for Langhorne Physician Services at St. Mary Medical Center, Langhorne, Pa.\n\n\n\nOne patient \"kept his appointments, took his medications, changed his diet, and started exercising. He saw a diabetes educator.\" Today, John Henry is thriving, enjoying his healthy new lifestyle.\n\n\n\nThe second patient ignored the doctor's advice. \"She soon lost feeling in her legs, had one amputated, and went blind,\" Ciccotelli said. \"Last year, she died.\"\n\n\n\nFor decades, doctors have been paid to perform procedures, not practice prevention or improve care coordination.\n\n\n\nBut a combination of factors - from the aging of the baby boomers to the explosion in health-care and insurance costs to the passage of the Affordable Care Act -- is driving the health-care system and patients to assume more hands-on roles.\n\n\n\nNowhere is this more evident than in the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and chronic heart failure, diseases that particularly affect seniors.\n\n\n\nDriving the change is a monumental shift in how the Medicare system is demanding better outcomes by paying for performance. For instance, hospitals are now penalized if too many patients are readmitted too soon after discharge.\n\n\n\nPennsylvania saw a 28 percent reduction in readmissions from 2010 to 2013.\n\n\n\nHospitals and health systems are experimenting with innovative programs to improve care for what once were dismissed as \"lifestyle diseases.\" Some employ nurses or social workers to stay in touch with patients, such as to ensure they fill their prescriptions, make physician appointments and follow their care plans.\n\n\n\n96 million Americans\n\n\n\nSuccess requires enthusiastic buy-in from patients. For example, Jacqueline Zakorchemny, 68, a retired advertising agency owner, has battled high blood pressure since her 20s and obesity for decades. Ten years ago, she learned she was diabetic.\n\n\n\nBut she didn't take her health seriously until last year when her doctor warned her she would soon need insulin injections.\n\n\n\n\"Shooting insulin for me was like hitting rock bottom,\" she said.\n\n\n\nZakorchemny is one of an estimated 96 million Americans living with chronic conditions, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Seventy-one cents of every U.S. health-care dollar goes to treat chronic conditions, which affect 80 percent of seniors.\n\n\n\nAt a Chester County Hospital diabetes education class, Zakorchemny finally had an epiphany. \"I wasn't overeating,\" she says. \"But I was not eating healthy foods.\" Zakorchemny, who also has multiple sclerosis, had trouble exercising due to poor balance. But she changed her diet and started walking, dropping 25 pounds as her blood sugar numbers improved.\n\n\n\n\"I've been married for 44 years, and I have three grandchildren. I want to be around to see them grow up,\" she said.\n\n\n\nClick here for a longer version of this article.\n\n\n\n--Mark Taylor\n\n\n\n\n\n(The Inquirer)PHILADELPHIA--Healthcare professionals say the landmark health reform law, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), is accelerating changes in how hospitals treat patients with chronic conditions like diabetes, heart failure and obesity.Successfully treating those patients, who use many more healthcare services, have higher rates of hospitalization and more frequentemergency department visits, is challenging because many of their conditions are aggravated by unhealthy eating habits and inactivity. Chronic disease rates increase steadily as patients age, making this issue particularly key to the Medicare program.Medicare has been paying a set amount for each hospital admission, regardless of the length of stay or the outcome. If patients were readmitted, even because they were sent home too soon, Medicare would pay again.America's health system has been structured to respond to major health episodes like heart attacks after the damage is done, said Jonathan Maner, senior vice president of Langhorne Physician Services at St. Mary Medical Center, here.\"That's the most expensive way to practice healthcare. It requires hospitalization, pricey tests and specialists that inflate the cost of care. Obamacare is turning that on its head. We're placing a greater emphasis on prevention and early detection. The cheapest way to manage diabetes is to never have it, to manage heart disease by monitoring blood pressure, weight and cholesterol, and teaching patients how to manage their conditions.\"Now, as part of the health reform effort, new payment and delivery models and mandates are being implemented to reward or penalize hospitals for their rates of 30-day readmissions, infection control and patient satisfaction levels.Maner said primary care physicians are the quarterbacks driving the patient care teams at St. Mary's care models inspired by the ACA.\"They have the training to understand how to get people healthier,\" he explained.Like many hospitals, Temple University Health System is adjusting to mandates to improve patient health.Vice President of Clinical Integration Steve Carson, who leads Temple's Center for Population Health, said its patients face challenges like transportation and childcare needs, access to healthy foods and safe housing, as well as lifestyle factors that include tobacco and substance abuse. Carson said Temple works with physicians and grassroots organizations that support patients.\"The goal is to provide infrastructure to help manage their daily lives and health,\" Carson said. Temple is participating in a federal initiative with the Einstein Health System and the Philadelphia Corporation for Aging on a care model called a \"bridge coordinator.\"That program uses a social worker to connect with patients in the hospital at risk of readmission, follows them post discharge and continues to check on them at home by phone. He said readmission rates for those \"bridge coordinator\" patients dropped by 35 percent.Marlton, N.J.-based Virtua Health System is exploring new ways to improve population health, said Vice President Michael Kotzen. Kotzen said hospital staff identify high-risk patients and connect them with community care managers, who track and guide them after discharge.While individual hospitals may see improvements in care and cost reductions, healthcare economist Uwe Reinhardt said it's too soon to tell whether the U.S. health system saves money.Reinhardt, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University, said Obamacare may improve the quality of the healthcare experience for the patient, but the cost savings have not yet materialized.\"The process doesn't work this quickly,\u201d said Reinhardt. \u201cWe will probably need 10 years to determine its effectiveness. The problem with Americans is we are extremely impatient people and we don't like to hear that some things take a lot longer to know.\"Chronic diseases, broadly defined as long-lasting conditions that can be controlled but not cured, are the leading cause of death in the United States.
