Lists of 2014 rates are available at www.lni.wa.gov/ClaimsIns/Insurance/RatesRisk/Check/ RatesHistory/default.asp .\n\nState officials urge anyone interested in one of these policies to read the handbook, then get in touch with one of the department\u2019s account managers. A starting point for assistance, they say, is at www.lni.wa.gov/main/smallbusiness/ .\n\nA handbook explaining workers\u2019 compensation is available on the department\u2019s website, at www.lni.wa.gov/IPUB/101-002-000.pdf .\n\nThe Washington state Department of Labor and Industries requires most employers to provide industrial insurance for their employees. Self-employed workers can buy this coverage from the state, though for them it\u2019s optional.\n\nSelf-employed and working three jobs, Tim Ray expects his health insurance to protect him all day long \u2013 not just on nights and weekends.\n\nSo he was surprised to learn that Group Health, his longtime insurance carrier and one of Washington\u2019s largest, decided this year to stop covering workplace-caused illness and injury in its individual and small-group plans.\n\nWith only days to go before the March 31 deadline to purchase 2014 health insurance, Ray switched from Group Health to an individual policy from Premera Blue Cross. Premera, Ray said, told him it will cover workplace health issues.\n\nNow, Ray will have to find a new doctor, one on Premera\u2019s list. But at $421 a month his new, more comprehensive Premera policy will cost him $8 less than Group Health would have charged for a policy that excludes workplace issues, he said.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to have health care at all we need to have health care all hours of the day and not be excluding the time when I\u2019m working on the job,\u201d he said.\n\nRay, 59, has a complex workday: He teaches cross-country skiing, owns rental houses and programs computer-controlled industrial cutting machines. After hours he enjoys woodworking and tinkering with cars. The possible injuries from his hobbies are no different from the injuries he could experience while he\u2019s at work, he said.\n\nGroup Health\u2019s decision is one more reminder, he said, that people shopping for health insurance coverage ought to consult an insurance broker and study the fine print before they buy.\n\nOn that point, the insurance industry and the government officials who regulate it are in agreement.\n\nUnfortunately for self-employed consumers like Ray, coverage of workplace injury and illness rarely comes up in the continuing national uproar over health care reform.\n\nFor most Americans, health coverage comes from a large-group plan, offered by their employers. Coverage of workplace injury or illness is handled separately, by workers\u2019 compensation policies that large employers generally are required to provide.\n\nFor the self-employed, however, a workers\u2019 compensation plan is optional under Washington state law.\n\nGroup Health dropped this coverage from its individual plans because the costs from workplace injuries and rehabilitation have been so high. Rick Henshaw, Group Health\u2019s director of individual and family sales, said Group Health was losing money on that aspect of its benefit package.\n\nRequirements of the Affordable Care Act made health coverage more expensive to provide, he said, so to keep its rates competitive Group Health had to drop the benefit. There are rumors in the industry, Henshaw added, that other carriers might be preparing to do the same.\n\nRay said it wasn\u2019t clear to him what the distinction is, between the medical issues Group Health would cover during his long workdays and the issues it wouldn\u2019t.\n\nHenshaw explained it this way: \u201cIf you were doing something for the benefit of your employer or client and you were injured or became ill as a result, then your injury or illness is work related.\u201d As an example, he cited a construction worker who removes asbestos from buildings and contracts a chronic lung disease from inhaling the asbestos fibers.\n\nWorkers\u2019 compensation coverage, Henshaw pointed out, is available for self-employed people to buy from the Washington state Department of Labor and Industries.\n\nRay said he knows about workers\u2019 compensation coverage, from years ago when he managed a hardware store; it\u2019s costly, he said, and what he wants now is basic health coverage.\n\nBut workers\u2019 compensation covers a great deal more than medical bills, said Rena Shawver, a spokeswoman for the department. It also pays wages lost while an ill or injured worker is off the job, pays for rehabilitation and pays for vocational counseling if the worker becomes disabled and has to choose another career.\n\nThe cost of workers\u2019 compensation varies, because it\u2019s based on the risks involved in each worker\u2019s trade. According to the state\u2019s 2014 rates, an underground miner would pay $4 per hour worked; a florist, 71 cents; a janitor, $1.29. For Ray\u2019s three careers, Shawver said, the rates might be: $2.05 for skiing guide, $1.12 for property management and 12 cents for software design.\n\nApplicants for workers\u2019 insurance coverage need to consult with a state account manager to figure out their rate, Shawver said.\n\nStephanie Marquis, a spokeswoman for the state insurance commissioner\u2019s office, said it\u2019s no surprise and within the rights of an insurance carrier to drop coverage of workplace issues as Group Health has decided to do. Coverage of work-caused maladies is becoming less common among individual health policies, she said, and apparently is being left to the state\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system.\n\nRay said he finds the situation to be evidence that U.S. health care reform didn\u2019t go far enough. It\u2019s a problem, he said, \u201cwhen you allow (insurance companies) to cherry pick what they\u2019re going to cover.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Self-employed and working three jobs, Tim Ray expects his health insurance to protect him all day long \u2013 not just on nights and weekends.
