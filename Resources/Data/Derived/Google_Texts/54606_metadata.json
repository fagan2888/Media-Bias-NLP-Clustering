Earlier this week a state board overseeing Maryland\u2019s exchange voted to move away from their existing system and instead partner with a company that built Connecticut\u2019s exchange. The contractor that built the original exchange in Maryland, Noridian Health Care Solutions, was fired at the end of February.\n\nNow the impact of the losses in Maryland are being scrutinized by state officials for possible impacts on insurance costs in North Dakota.\n\n\u201cThe Insurance Department is closely monitoring the Noridian Healthcare Solutions (NHS) situation in Maryland,\u201d Deputy Insurance Commissioner Rebecca Ternes said in response to an emailed inquiry. \u201cThe impact of this situation has been included in the Department\u2019s ongoing financial exam on the parent company, Noridian Mutual Insurance Company. Financial examination work product is not public record until a final exam report is issued.\u201d\n\nBCBSND spokeswoman Andrea Dineen did not respond to phone calls or emails requesting comment. There was no date given for when the financial exam would be completed.\n\nNoridian Mutual Insurance Company operates under several brands, including Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota which controls roughly 80 percent of the state\u2019s insurance market.\n\nA recent quarterly filing by Noridian Mutual Insurance, of which Noridial Health Care Solutions is a wholly owned subsidiary, disclosed that an subsidiary was facing $17.8 million in projected losses. In late December BCBSND sent out a letter to state legislators announcing their intention to withdraw from the state\u2019s expansion of Medicaid, which was an element of the federal Affordable Care Act implemented by the state, citing financial risks.\n\n\u201cBCBSND is unable to assume the financial risk in the arrangement and is obligated to protect the company and its members from the unidentified claims costs for this population,\u201d the letter read.\n\nContact Rob Port at rport@watchdog.org", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "Part 93 of 97 in the series Obamacare By Rob Port | Watchdog.org North Dakota Bureau BISMARCK, N.D. \u2014\u00a0Maryland\u2019s state\u2019s health insurance exchange isn\u2019t working and that may have fallout for North Dakota insurance customers.
