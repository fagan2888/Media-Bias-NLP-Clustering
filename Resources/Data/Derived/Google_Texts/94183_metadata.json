The provision is part of the GOP plan for funding agriculture and food-safety programs.\n\nPolitico reports:\n\nIn a surprising twist, the bill language specifies that only rural areas are to benefit in the future from funding requested by the administration this year to continue a modest summer demonstration program to help children from low-income households \u2014 both urban and rural \u2014 during those months when school meals are not available.\n\nSince 2010, the program has operated from an initial appropriation of $85 million, and the goal has been to test alternative approaches to distribute aid when schools are not in session. The White House asked for an additional $30 million to continue the effort, but the House bill provides $27 million for what\u2019s described as an entirely new pilot program focused on rural areas only.\n\nDemocrats were surprised to see urban children were excluded. And the GOP had some trouble explaining the history itself. But a spokeswoman confirmed that the intent of the bill is a pilot project in \u201crural areas\u201d only.\n\n+++\n\nWyoming is the first state to reject new national science standards. Objections to the Next Generation Science Standards, which have already been adopted in 11 states, stem from the way it teaches about climate change. The curriculum argues that humans have an impact on climate change. The message may be unpopular in oil- and gas-rich states.\n\n+++\n\nThe Department of Justice has approved a merger of the nation\u2019s first and third largest flour millers.\n\nThe merger will combine the flour-milling operations of ConAgra, CHS and Cargill into a new entity called Ardent Mills. Ardent will have 44 mills and more than $4 billion in sales, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reports.\n\nThe Justice Department required the firms to sell four mills because of anti-trust concerns. Food & Water Watch, a nonprofit that opposed the merger, said the divestment was \u201cmeager\u201d and that the new milling concern would have \u201cstranglehold over most wheat farmers from the Rocky Mountains to the Mississippi River,\u201d the Star-Tribune reported.\n\n+++\n\nMaryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley has signed legislation that proponents hope will address disparities in rural parts of the state. The law adds 10 years to the life of the Rural Maryland Prosperity Investment Fund, \u201cincreases the capacity of the five regional rural councils and expands programming to include health care,\u201d The Star Democrat reports. About a quarter of the state\u2019s population lives in its 18 rural counties.\n\n+++\n\nPickens County Medical Center in Carrollton, Alabama, has laid off 14 workers and furloughed 13 more in a cost-saving measure necessitated by reductions in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, reports the Tuscaloosa ABC TV affiliate. Part of the financial difficulties stem from Alabama\u2019s decision not to expand Medicaid, as allowed under the federal Affordable Care Act. Twenty-one states have not expanded Medicaid, and three more are still considering their options as of March 2014.\n\n+++\n\nVoters in Jackson County, Washington, have approved a ban on growing genetically engineered crops. The measure requires people to \u201c\u2019harvest, destroy or remove all genetically engineered plants\u2019 within 12 months of the enactment of the ordinance,\u201d reports Reuters.\n\nNeighboring Josephine County enacted a similar ballot initiative, but that measure will face a challenge under a state law banning such county-level ordinances. The Jackson County measure was already in process before that law went into effect.\n\n+++\n\nRural banks in Kansas are expanding into metropolitan areas as a growth strategy, the FDIC reports.\n\nThe Kansas City Business Journal reports:\n\nThanks to a strong and robust agricultural economy, rural banks are typically strong. But it appears they aren't willing to rely on that strength forever, and are already establishing branches in metropolitan areas to spark growth. At the end of 2000, the study showed that 9.3 percent of community banks in depopulating rural areas operated branches in metropolitan areas. By year end of 2007, that rose to 17.5 percent. The trend is a big reason why the Kansas City metropolitan area had 135 different bank brands as of June 30, 2013.\n\n+++\n\nPresident Obama approved the creation of the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument this week. The 500,000-acre tract near Las Cruces, New Mexico, is a treasure trove of historical areas and artifacts, including petroglyphs from three Native tribes, a petrified forest and even some graffiti by Billy the Kid.\n\n\"This designation is a long time coming, and we are excited that Do\u00f1a Ana County is finally going to be able to reap the economic benefits of the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument,\u201d said Carrie Hamblen, executive director of the Las Cruces Green Chamber of Commerce.\n\n+++\n\nThe Garden State lives up to its nickname, according to the newly released results of the 2012 Census of Agriculture. New Jersey isn\u2019t usually the first state that comes to mind when you think about agriculture, but the ag business, especially floriculture, seems to be thriving. According to the USDA, since the last census was released five years ago:\n\nSquare footage for nursery stock crops in New Jersey more than doubled from 7.8 million square feet to 16 million. And greenhouse tomatoes went from 162,000 square feet to 275,000.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf807\"", "article_summary": "At the end of 2000, the study showed that 9.3 percent of community banks in depopulating rural areas operated branches in metropolitan areas.\nBut a spokeswoman confirmed that the intent of the bill is a pilot project in \u201crural areas\u201d only.\nBut it appears they aren't willing to rely on that strength forever, and are already establishing branches in metropolitan areas to spark growth.\n+++Rural banks in Kansas are expanding into metropolitan areas as a growth strategy, the FDIC reports.\n+++The Garden State lives up to its nickname, according to the newly released results of the 2012 Census of Agriculture."}
