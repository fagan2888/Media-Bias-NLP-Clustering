ISTOCK

ROBERT PLANT: As a professor, one phrase I hear repeatedly is that the millennials are more technology savvy than any other generation. I would have to disagree. Millennials may be more accustomed to consuming information from mobile platforms and browsers than prior generations, but the very ease at which this information can be obtained has caused them to have a diminished appreciation of the underlying computer science.

Prior generations struggled as children with technology, sometimes just to get something to work. For example, making a RadioShack TRS-80 talk to a Commodore 64 so two friends could play battleships; connecting an IBM PC XT to an Apple Lisa to share a graphical file; or hooking up a dial-up modem. Todayâ€™s children have never faced real memory shortages that required compressing data into a hexadecimal to store a file in 16K of memory; nor have they manipulated operating systems at the command level to get things to work.

While these technologies have now largely been relegated to the history books, parents who grew up with them acknowledge that they benefited significantly from working so closely with the computer and its systems. As such perhaps now is the time to go back to the future and introduce children once again to the delights of hands-on computing.
