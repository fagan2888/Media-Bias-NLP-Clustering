Hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers, and urgent care clinics do the same. Why shouldn\u2019t they? They don\u2019t have to pay an army of staff to fill reams of forms and wait weeks to months to collect payment from an insurance company that sometimes is lower than what they get from their direct-pay patients.\n\nYet most of these same providers have much higher \u201clist prices\u201d\u2014the official prices they list publicly\u2014which are used to negotiate compensation contracts with health insurance companies and other third party payers.\n\nExamples abound of outlandish differences between the publicly posted \u201clist prices\u201d of providers and health care facilities and the \u201cdiscounted\u201d prices these same providers offer to uninsured patients negotiating on an individualized, \u201cspecial case\u201d basis. I recently wrote of a patient of mine who saved $17,000 by negotiating to pay directly for his hernia operation rather than using his health insurance. In Oklahoma City, the Surgery Center of Oklahoma takes no Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance, and provides a range of surgical services to the community for a small fraction of the prices offered by other doctors and facilities that use the conventional third party system. And they list their prices proudly on their website. This and other examples of providers who have opted out of the third party game have been recently documented at Reason.\n\nContrary to \u201cconventional wisdom,\u201d health insurance\u2014private or otherwise\u2014does not make health care more affordable. The third party payment system is the principal force behind health care price inflation. This should come as no surprise.\n\nNobel-winning economist Milton Friedman, in his masterpiece \u201cFree to Choose,\u201d wrote of four ways to spend money:\n\nCategory I\u2014You spend your money on something for yourself. Here you are very careful, because it is your money, and the good or service you are buying is for you.\n\nCategory II\u2014You spend your money on something for someone else. Here you have the same incentive as in Category I to economize, but since you are buying something for someone else, you are not quite as meticulous when it comes to the purchase meeting the needs or values of the recipient.\n\nCategory III\u2014You spend someone else\u2019s money on something for yourself. Here you are not concerned about how much you spend, because it is not your money. But because you are spending on yourself, you make sure you are getting what you want.\n\nCategory IV\u2014You spend someone else\u2019s money on something for yet another person or persons. (This is what we ask our legislative representatives to do every day.) Here you are the least incentivized to economize, or to buy something that meets the needs or values of the recipient.\n\nLike the government does, third party payers operate under the dynamic outlined in Friedman\u2019s Category IV. This becomes most obvious when it comes to the government acting as third party payer, e.g., Medicare and Medicaid. And it doesn\u2019t just pertain to health care (think of $800 toilet seats for the defense department). When the government buys goods or services for other people with other peoples\u2019 money, special interest pleading, political concerns, and cronyism run the game. And \u201cleakage\u201d of money through \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse\u201d is a given.\n\nBut private insurance companies are also spending other peoples\u2019 money\u2014the premiums paid into a risk pool\u2014on medical services for other people. When they negotiate compensation schedules with providers and facilities, they don\u2019t have to bargain hard enough to reach the best price possible. They just have to reach a price that is good enough\u2014one that allows them to charge premiums that compete well with rival insurance companies. They pass on the difference between what they could have negotiated and what they actually negotiated to their customers who pay the premiums.\n\nMeanwhile, when the third party payer is perceived as picking up most of the tab, then health care consumers and health care providers engage in Category III spending. Neither have an incentive to take cost into consideration.\n\nPeople who negotiate direct payment from providers get much better deals than the insurance companies get. In the example of my patient who saved $17,000, the hospital asked for $23,000 to use its facility for a simple outpatient surgery. He got a bid for just over $2,000 at another hospital, when he offered to pay directly as a \u201cspecial case.\u201d But insurance companies regularly agree to pay the hospitals thousands more for their facility charge. This makes complete sense when viewing the payment mechanism through the lens of Friedman\u2019s spending categories.\n\nWhen health care providers give discounts for direct payment they don\u2019t lose money in the process. Otherwise they wouldn\u2019t do it. And, in order to keep direct-pay patients from walking away, they need to keep their prices acceptable to the patients paying the bill. Just imagine the prices providers would offer if a much greater proportion of the population paid directly for health care. My patient would have saved more than $17,000, because all of the providers involved would be openly competing with other providers for direct-pay business. Just look at the fields of cosmetic surgery, Lasik eye surgery, and dentistry, as examples of how the absence\u2014or minimal presence\u2014of third party payers drive prices down and quality and service up.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say we don\u2019t need health insurance. Health insurance that covers truly unforeseen, costly catastrophic occurrences makes sense for most people. As does life insurance, property and casualty insurance, and auto insurance. But health insurance that covers routine, predictable events isn\u2019t really insurance. It\u2019s prepaid health care. And it is driving up prices for everyone with everyone else\u2019s money.\n\nPolicymakers need to understand that the key to \u201caffordable health care\u201d is not to increase the role of health insurance in peoples\u2019 lives, but to diminish it. We need much less Category IV spending on health care, and much more of Category I.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2013/12/10/health-cares-third-party-spending-trap", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "Contrary to \"conventional wisdom,\" health insurance\u2014private or otherwise\u2014does not make health care more affordable.", "title": "Health Care's Third-Party Spending Trap"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "description": "Many doctors\u2014myself included\u2014 will gladly substantially discount\ntheir fees in return for up-front payments from people who pay\ndirectly for their health care.
