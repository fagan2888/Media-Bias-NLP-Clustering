WOODBRIDGE A 45-year-old man was transported to the burn unit at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston with severe burns after working on a lawnmower.

According to police, the man and his friend were working on a lawnmower during the day Tuesday. They put gas in the mower and left the can on the ground.

Around 8:30 p.m., the 45-year-old man and his friend were sitting in the backyard smoking a cigarette. Police said the friend got up, walked off the deck and saw a bright flash, turned and saw the 45-year-old on fire.

The friend grabbed a tarp and rolled the 45-year-old man on the ground, eventually extinguishing the fire.

It is unknown exactly how the man caught fire.

Members of the Colonia Fire Department are investigating, but the fire does not appear to be suspicious, police said.
