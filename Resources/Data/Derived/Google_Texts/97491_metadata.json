The family legal squabbles have raged on even following Kasem\u2019s death at the age of 82 on Father\u2019s Day, June 15. The American Top 40 announcer\u2019s second wife, Jean, contends she should have the final say over her deceased husband\u2019s final resting place. His adult children from his first marriage disagree.\n\nThey believe that they should have this right, as Kasey reportedly mentioned to them where he wanted his final resting place to be. Casey Kasem\u2019s daughter, Kerri, has stated that she thinks that Jean Kasem, acting out of spite, has possibly already taken her father\u2019s body out of the country to have him buried.\n\nIn the months leading up to the passing of Casey Kasem, the adult children of the radio host had several court battles with Kasem\u2019s second wife, Jean, 60. Though a judge granted Kerri a conservatorship over her the health of her father, Jean did not like it that Kerri and her siblings wanted to carry out Kasem\u2019s written wishes and withhold food, water and medicine from him in his final days rather than to prolong his agony any longer. Casey\u2019s second wife argued in court that her husband\u2019s adult children were trying to prematurely end Casey\u2019s life.\n\nNot long before his death, doctors informed Kerri that he just had a few days left to live.The doctors told her that Casey\u2019s body was in the process of shutting down. They recommended that he should be placed in a hospice and that, as the artificial feeding and hydration he was receiving was causing him to experience painful side-effects similar to drowning, those measures should be stopped.\n\nAccording to Danny Deraney, publicist for Kerri Kasem, Jean Kasem was responsible for having Casey\u2019s body removed from Gaffney Funeral Home in Tacoma, Washington. Casey Kasem had been in a hospice in Santa Monica, California, placed there by his adult children from his first marriage. Then, Jean Kasem allegedly removed her sick and dying husband from the hospice and drove him in her car to Washington, where they holed up at the house of a friend of the family.\n\nThough the adult children of Casey Kasem eventually got their father back, Jean Kasem was still waging court battles against them up to the time of Casey\u2019s demise. While under hospice care, Casey Kasem passed away at St. Anthony Hospital in Gig Harbor.\n\nThe death of Casey Kasem was not the end of the legal battles, though. After his death, each side wanted the final say in the final resting place of the much-beloved radio host. When Casey\u2019s body disappeared from the Gaffney Funeral Home, Kerri Kasem immediately considered the possibility that Jean had spirited her father\u2019s body out of the country.\n\nWhen Jean was asked by a reporter at CNN if her husband\u2019s body was missing and if she had anything to do with it, she answered \u201cIt\u2019s not. Would you leave us to grieve in peace?\u201d However, she did not comment about why she is convinced that her husband\u2019s body is not missing.\n\nAccording to an employee at Gaffney Funeral Home, Candace Corkum, Casey Kasem\u2019s body had been at their facility in Washington, but she added that it was not there in their care currently. She did not or could not tell the CNN reporter she spoke to exactly how Kasem\u2019s body was taken from the funeral home.\n\nTim Grant, funeral director at Gaffney Funeral Home & Cremation Services, also stated that the body of Casey Kasem was no longer there. He said that he \u201ccannot discuss the actual arrangements themselves.\u201d\n\nThe New York Daily News on Friday mentioned that Jean Kasem had commissioned a privately done autopsy to be performed on her husband. Despite a temporary restraining order that Kerri Kasem had been granted on Wednesday by Pierce County Superior Court Judge Ronald Culpepper, meant to prevent Jean Kasem from spiriting away Kasem\u2019s body and having it buried elsewhere, the order apparently came too late. Jean Kasem had already made arrangements for Casey\u2019s body to be transported to the Urgel Bourgie Funeral Home in Montreal, Canada, according to a copy of the death certificate.\n\nHowever, a man who answered the phone there claimed that Casey Kasem\u2019s body was not there and that his name had never been in the computer system. Kerri has a few other ideas of where Jean Kasem may have had Casey\u2019s body shipped.\n\nKerri stated that her dad \u201clived in Los Angeles for 45 years.\u201d She added that her \u201cstepmother is not acting in my father\u2019s best interest or respecting his wishes\u201d if she has, indeed, buried his body in Canada. Kerri Kasem thinks that if her stepmother, Jean, has not had her father\u2019s body buried in Canada, it might have been shipped to some other country to be buried. She reportedly believes that his body might even end up even in France or Israel.\n\nKerri stated that Forest Lawn Cemetery, located in Hollywood Hills, California, was where her father had told his adult children that he wanted his final resting place to be. Yet, Jean Kasem\u2019s use of a Jerusalem address on Casey\u2019s death certificate has led Kerri to suspect that her stepmother might have had his body shipped to Israel for burial.\n\nKerri, accusing her stepmother of elder abuse, has filed a police report in Santa Monica, California, to have a follow-up autopsy done on her father. She is afraid that the truth might never be known about her father\u2019s death if her stepmother, Jean, has removed Casey\u2019s body or has had it cremated.\n\nCasey Kasem was suffering from an infected pressure wound that Kerri believes was caused sometime after Jean removed him from hospice care and journeyed with him cross country to Washington. He was also suffering from a type of dementia known as Lewy Body Disease.\n\nIt might be a long time, if ever, before the truth about what happened to the missing body of radio host Casey Kasem is known. The legal wranglings between the adult children of Casey Kasem and their stepmother, Jean, are likely far from over. There is a possibility that the body of the radio icon has yet to be buried.\n\nWritten By Douglas Cobb\n\nCNN\n\nNew York Daily News\n\nThe Seattle Times\n\nShare this: Print\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nPocket\n\nReddit\n\nEmail\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nFacebook\n\nTumblr\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Guardian Liberty Voice", "description": "The body of Casey Kasem, radio host and the cartoon voice of Shaggy, is missing.
