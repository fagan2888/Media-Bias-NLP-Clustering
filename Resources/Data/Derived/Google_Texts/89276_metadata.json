That awareness, depending on how you react to media coverage of the epidemic, may have morphed to concern, anxiety, or \u2014 hopefully not \u2014 panic, after a man in Dallas came down with the virus following his travels to Liberia and back to the U.S.\n\nDr. Kemper Alston is an infectious disease physician and Medical Director of Infection Prevention at Fletcher Allen Health Care. In a recent blog post, he laid out what Vermonters need to know about Ebola.\n\n\u201cThis is unique just because of its sheer size and magnitude,\u201d Alston said. Ebola outbreaks have been documented since 1976, and a lot is known about the virus and how it\u2019s transmitted. What\u2019s different this time, Alston said, is that earlier outbreaks were in rural areas, and this one is in urban areas. \u201cTherefore the potential for transmission has been greater.\u201d\n\n\"We're operating under the assumption that we'll get somebody. We might get someone ... who's traveled to those countries [Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia], or we might get a U.S. health care worker who is returning ill after volunteering in West Africa.\" - Dr. Kemper Alston\n\nThere\u2019s no specific treatment or vaccine for Ebola, which Alston noted is true for many viruses. But he expects a vaccine to be available within the next year or two.\n\n\u201cThe treatment that\u2019s provided is really just supportive care, fluids, electrolytes, temperature control, oxygen. It\u2019s really just basic supportive care. And it\u2019s interesting to see how people will do and how they survive in American hospitals as compared to those facilities in Africa where the resources are just so strictly limited,\u201d Alston said.\n\nAlston said it\u2019s likely that Fletcher Allen will treat an Ebola patient.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re operating under the assumption that we\u2019ll get somebody. We might get someone unexpectedly who shows up with a fever who\u2019s traveled to those countries [Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia], or we might get a U.S. health care worker who is returning ill after volunteering in West Africa. We\u2019re operating under the assumption that this outbreak isn\u2019t going to end anytime soon, and we have to be ready to deal with it.\u201d Hospital staff is having regular meetings, and the hospital has the equipment needed to deal with infected patients. He wrote:\n\n\u201cPreventing transmission does not require high-tech equipment that is not routinely available. Simple barriers, such as gowns, gloves, masks and eye protection are what is required.\u201d\n\nBut just because Fletcher Allen is prepared, does not mean people should be overly anxious. Contracting Ebola requires direct contact with someone with the virus, and Alston wrote it is not an airborne disease.\n\n\u201cIt is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids or tissues of a person who is ill. This fact means that widespread transmission in the U.S. is very unlikely to occur. Body fluids include saliva, mucus, vomit, feces, sweat, tears, breast milk, urine, and semen.\u201d\n\n\u201cPassing someone on the street, entering the room they are in, sitting on a bus with them, you\u2019re not going to contract Ebola,\u201d he explained.\n\nThis week, the hospital is talking about instituting systematic screening for fever and travel for all emergency room visits. The practice would then spread to all primary care offices.\n\n\"For the average Vermonter in the community, this poses absolutely no risk.\"\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t done that yet, because we haven\u2019t thought that the risk justified that. But after what happened in Dallas where they missed the travel history or the travel history wasn\u2019t communicated very well, we\u2019re actively talking and we\u2019ll probably this week institute screening all of our emergency room visits with a fever to see if they\u2019ve traveled to West Africa within 21 days,\u201d Alston explained.\n\nWhile they are prepared for a case of Ebola, an epidemic is very unlikely, Alston wrote:\n\n\u201cThe epidemic nature of the disease in West Africa reflects a complex interplay of factors that do not exist in the U.S. An epidemic of Ebola in this country is extremely unlikely. Having said that, with the sheer number of infected persons in West Africa, it is nearly certain that more cases will arrive in the U.S.; they need to be promptly recognized, diagnosed, and isolated.\u201d\n\nAlston said the heightened awareness of Ebola is a good thing, but the price is anxiety. Medical providers at Fletcher Allen have seen that reflected in the questions people ask about the virus.\n\n\u201cI heard last week that someone was scared to travel to Dallas,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to overcome and be realistic about this. I think the real issues for the health care system within Fletcher Allen if we had to care for a patient like this, we just have to make sure the processes are in place. For the average Vermonter in the community, this poses absolutely no risk.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "VPR News", "description": "By now you are no doubt familiar with the news that several West African countries are suffering from an outbreak of the potentially deadly Ebola virus.", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "VPR News", "og": {"url": "http://digital.vpr.net/post/preparing-ebola-vermonts-largest-hospital", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/vpr/files/styles/medium/public/201410/fletcher-allen-vpr-evancie-20140608.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By now you are no doubt familiar with the news that several West African countries are suffering from an outbreak of the potentially deadly Ebola virus.", "title": "Preparing For Ebola At Vermont's Largest Hospital"}, "story_id": 354265666, "twitter": {"site": "@vprnet", "card": "summary", "creator": "@vprnet"}, "author": "Mitch Wertlieb, Melody Bodette", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Preparing For Ebola At Vermont&#039;s Largest Hospital"}, "nid": 31476, "datePublished": "2014-10-07", "keywords": "Health Care, Health, Fletcher Allen, Burlington, VPR News, News Features", "wordCount": 866, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0730\"", "article_summary": "By now you are no doubt familiar with the news that several West African countries are suffering from an outbreak of the potentially deadly Ebola virus.\nAlston said it\u2019s likely that Fletcher Allen will treat an Ebola patient.\n- Dr. Kemper AlstonThere\u2019s no specific treatment or vaccine for Ebola, which Alston noted is true for many viruses.\nEbola outbreaks have been documented since 1976, and a lot is known about the virus and how it\u2019s transmitted.\nContracting Ebola requires direct contact with someone with the virus, and Alston wrote it is not an airborne disease."}
