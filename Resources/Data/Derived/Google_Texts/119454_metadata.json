On Oct. 2, the day after the full launch of Obamacare, he arrived at the walk-in and call center of HealthSource RI, the state\u2019s health exchange vendor, looking weary, with mussed salt-and-pepper hair and an un-tucked plaid shirt. He sat in a brand-new armchair in a brand-new waiting room, eager to try out America\u2019s great experiment in health insurance.\n\nYepes, a 49-year-old food-service worker from Colombia, has followed the Obamacare debate via the Spanish news channel Univision. He\u2019d been looking forward to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and was therefore \u201cfrustrated with the [government] shutdown. I thought it was gonna create problems for Obamacare, but I was glad it didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nHe and his wife and four children were hoping to purchase a reasonably priced plan under the ACA, without fear of lifetime caps or restrictions on preexisting conditions. But he waited until the second day: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to go the first day because they wouldn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nAt the walk-in center, Yepes was called into a small back room. A woman trained as a health care navigator sat with him at a computer, going through each screening step at healthsourceri.com. \u201cThey had to get so much information from me,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people have to know what I eat for lunch!\u201d At one point, Yepes had to go home to retrieve some documents he hadn\u2019t thought to bring, like his income tax return and Social Security card.\n\nYet after three hours with the navigator, Yepes left HealthSource RI without having enrolled or gotten a sense of what a decent plan might cost his family. The system would not process his wife\u2019s green card number, and because he did not have all the information the exchange needed, \u201cThey couldn\u2019t give me any information at all about the plans,\u201d he said. This, he found frustrating.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m buying a product, and they have many different products, so why can\u2019t they get that information to me?\u201d His plan now is two wait \u201ctwo or three months\u201d before trying again. \u201cI think they\u2019ll be in good shape by then.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Navigators troubleshoot enrollment, and outreach to the poor remains a pressing concern", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.aljazeera.simple", "og": {"url": "http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2013/10/3/in-rhode-island-animperfectyethopefulobamacarelaunch.html", "image": {"width": 960, "identifier": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/3/in-rhode-island-animperfectyethopefulobamacarelaunch/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.rhode_island_aca_100313.1380829811360.jpg", "height": 600}, "type": "article", "description": "Navigators troubleshoot enrollment, and outreach to the poor remains a pressing concern", "title": "In Rhode Island, an imperfect yet hopeful Obamacare launch"}, "twitter": {"site": "@AJAM", "image": "http://america.aljazeera.com/content/ajam/articles/2013/10/3/in-rhode-island-animperfectyethopefulobamacarelaunch/jcr:content/mainpar/adaptiveimage/src.adapt.960.high.rhode_island_aca_100313.1380829811360.jpg", "description": "Navigators troubleshoot enrollment, and outreach to the poor remains a pressing concern", "card": "summary", "title": "In Rhode Island, an imperfect yet hopeful Obamacare launch"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=810543104, affiliate-data=10lxKx", "keywords": "Health Care, Rhode Island, Obamacare, U.S., Health", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd38c1\"", "article_summary": "Yepes, a 49-year-old food-service worker from Colombia, has followed the Obamacare debate via the Spanish news channel Univision.\nHe sat in a brand-new armchair in a brand-new waiting room, eager to try out America\u2019s great experiment in health insurance.\nPROVIDENCE, R.I. \u2014 The debt from his wife\u2019s thyroid cancer treatments \u2014 $18,000 and mounting \u2014 drew Jaime Yepes to the industrial park on Little Royal Drive.\nA woman trained as a health care navigator sat with him at a computer, going through each screening step at healthsourceri.com.\nOn Oct. 2, the day after the full launch of Obamacare, he arrived at the walk-in and call center of HealthSource RI, the state\u2019s health exchange vendor, looking weary, with mussed salt-and-pepper hair and an un-tucked plaid shirt."}
