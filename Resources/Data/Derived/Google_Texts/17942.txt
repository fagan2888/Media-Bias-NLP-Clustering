One man is dead after a Colorado homeowner selling an item on Craigslist was tied up during a home invasion, got free, grabbed a gun and shot a suspect.

The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office says two men went to the home Sunday in response to the ad, but overpowered the homeowner and tied him up.

Sheriff's spokeswoman Jacki Kelley says one of the suspects stole the man's car. Kelley says the homeowner grabbed a gun and opened fire, hitting and killing the suspect.

According to KMGH-TV, deputies are searching for a man in another vehicle. They say the other vehicle may have damage and bullet holes in it.
