One Fort Walton Beach teen has been charged with reckless driving after Florida Highway officials say he was trying to show off for his friends.

Around 5:30 Saturday night, FHP officials were called out to the Whataburger in Miramar Beach in Walton County after a teen crashed his car into the building.

According to reports, 18-year old Nicholas Glover was showing his two friends how to "drift" in his car, when he lost control and hit two windows and a wall of the Whataburger.

No one was injured in the vehicle or inside the restaurant.
