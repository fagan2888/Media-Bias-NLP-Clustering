According to a press release from Rep. Stivers\u2019 office, the broad goals of the bill are \u201cto increase consumer access to generic drugs, boost market competition and ultimately save consumers money.\u201d\n\nAt issue is what the Generic Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA) and many other trade organizations and allied advocates, including two super-sized pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), Express Scripts and Prime Therapeutics, refer to as the \u201cabuse\u201d of the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), a policy intended to protect patient safety through a variety of mechanisms.\n\n\u201cREMS are required risk management plans that use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of certain prescription drugs outweigh their risks,\u201d according to the FDA. In many cases, FDA approval of a product is contingent on attaching a REMS requirement to a drug, especially if there are safety concerns that might otherwise make it harder to get the drug approved.\n\nWhile some commonly used REMS mechanisms are clearly good for patients, such as providing patient safety guides or monitoring liver function tests (LFTs), there is one aspect of the REMS program that has been subverted by brand drug manufacturers in order to thwart competition from generics companies, according to Stivers and Welch.\n\nControlling distribution through ETASU\n\nAccording to information from the FDA about the REMS Program, \u201cNo two REMS are exactly alike.\u201d When the FDA implemented REMS in 2007 as part of the FDA Amendments Act of 2007, they included a provision known as the ETASU clause (Elements to Assure Safe Use), which effectively allows a drug company to carefully control the distribution of a drug---and in the process deny distribution of a drug sample to a would-be generic competitor.\n\nProponents of the FAST Generics Act argue that by misusing the ETASU clause, brand companies have found a loophole through which to further their corporate interests at the expense of the public.\n\nLarge-scale opportunity costs\n\nAccording to a report published by Alex Brill, an analyst at Matrix Global Advisors, in July 2014, REMS abuse costs the U.S. healthcare system $5.4 billion per year, including $1.8 billion to the federal government through Medicare coverage.\n\nIn his report, \u201cLost Prescription Drug Savings from Use of REMS Programs to Delay Generic Market Entry,\u201d Brill makes the case that the costs of REMS abuse are growing, because the FDA is requiring REMS more frequently as a way to protect public safety. In fact, Brill estimates that almost 40% of new FDA approvals are subject to REMS.\n\nThe second time around\n\nWhen the FAST Generics Act of 2014 was introduced in the House of Representatives by Stivers and Welch in September 2014, there was hearty endorsement from the GPhA, along with a flurry of press coverage that continued for months. But ultimately, the bill went nowhere after being referred to the Subcommittee on Healthcare Reform.\n\nSo what\u2019s different this time?\n\nWhile the provisions of the bill are exactly the same, the REMS reform issue has gained considerable momentum in the last nine months as awareness and activism around the issue have increased.\n\nOn December 4, 2014, the FDA issued Draft Guidance, \u201cHow to Obtain a Letter from FDA Stating that Bioequivalence Study Protocols Contain Safety Protections Comparable to Applicable REMS for RLD.\u201d\n\nThe mechanism proposed by the FDA as part of the draft guidance suggests that a generics company obtain a letter from the FDA confirming that their proposed bioequivalence studies provide safety protections comparable to REMS. In addition, the FDA also provides injunctive relief in cases where generics companies are unfairly denied access to product samples.\n\nUnfortunately, the FDA\u2019s guidance was not widely heralded as the answer to the problem, because while it provides ways to potentially increase access in the face of unfair roadblocks, it does not explicitly require that a brand company actually provide samples to a generics company.\n\nIn contrast, the FAST Generics Act positions the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as the intermediary between the generic and the brand manufacturers. Under the proposed scenario, generics companies would seek authorization from the DHHS and then submit a request to a brand manufacturer, along with the authorization. They would also have injunctive relief and be able to seek damages from three parties if unfairly denied access to product samples.\n\nA powerhouse coalition steps up to the plate\n\nOn June 17, a coalition headed up by the GPhA sent a letter of support for the FAST Generics Act to Representatives Stiver and Welch, citing statistics from Brill\u2019s research and making the point that REMS abuse is tantamount to compromising the integrity of the Hatch-Waxman Act.\n\nThis group, which includes GPHa, Express Scripts, the Healthcare Supply Chain Association (HSCA), UAW, the National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS), the National Coalition on Health Care (NCHC), the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System OPERS), the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA), the Premiere Healthcare Alliance, Prime Therapeutics, the Public Sector Healthcare Roundtable and the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust, includes diverse interests and constituencies, but they have an overriding common interest---to make sure that consumers have greater access to generic medications at affordable prices.\n\nPhRMA responds\n\nAlthough the Pharmaceutical Researchers and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) has not come out against the FAST Generics Act explicitly, a spokesperson was quoted by the WSJ saying, \u201cREMS are a critical regulatory tool for protecting patient safety. While we are still reviewing the legislation, we are concerned it could undermine the FDA-approved programs intended to address very serious risks to patients.\u201d\n\nStivers and Welch are ready for round two\n\nThe goals of the FAST Generics Act haven\u2019t changed. As Stivers said, \u201cOur bill closes federal loopholes to ensure customers have faster access to less costly generic drugs by increasing market competition and eliminating bureaucratic red tape.\u201d\n\nThe bill, which was just submitted to the House Energy and Commerce Committee\u2014the same committee championing the 21st Century Cures Act\u2014has undoubtedly picked up steam as awareness around the issue of REMS abuse has grown.\n\nGiven the Supreme Court\u2019s decision yesterday to uphold the Affordable Care Act, as well as the focus on defining the relative value of expensive cancer treatments using a scorecard and other steps being taken to control costs, while ensuring access, the current climate favors a better reception for this year\u2019s FAST Generics Act.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Nicole Gray", "twitter": {"domain": "BioPharma Dive", "site": "@biopharmadive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "True", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.biopharmadive.com/user_media/cache/42/25/422525c8866d3718c0abc955d12dfbfd.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "biopharma,type-newspost,biopharma-regulatory", "news_keywords": "Regulatory / Compliance,Regulatory", "category": "News Post", "sailthru.item_featured": 1, "title": "REMS reform, round 2: Will the FAST Generics Act speed past the finish line this year?", "pub_date": "jun 26, 2015", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2015-06-26T08:28:19", "content_boost": 5, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Friday, June 26, 2015, 08:28 AM", "medium": "news", "description": "BioPharma", "sailthru.expire_date": "2025-06-13T08:28:19", "teaser": "<p>REMS is meant to enhance patient safety.
