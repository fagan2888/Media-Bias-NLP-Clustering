Baucus is now the U.S. Ambassador to China.\n\nWalsh was already running for the Senate Seat when appointed. Bullock\u2019s move to appoint him has been seen as an attempt to give Walsh a political edge in this November\u2019s election against likely Republican challenger, Congressman Steve Daines.\n\nSenator Walsh is currently on a tour of several Montana cities and took the time to stop by our studios in Missoula. In this feature interview, Walsh speaks with Capitol Reporter Dan Boyce about his more than 30-year career in the Montana National Guard, his priorities in his new office, and the perception his appointment was crafted by Washington D.C. insiders.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Montana News", "description": "Montana\u2019s newest United States Senator, John Walsh, is starting his second month in office.
