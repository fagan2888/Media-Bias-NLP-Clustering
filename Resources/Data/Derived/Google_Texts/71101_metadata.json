He said Republicans wouldn\u2019t be able to extend spending caps into 2016 and called on them to negotiate.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not at all clear to me that there is enough support in the United States Congress to pass a budget that would lock in sequester spending,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cThere\u2019s good reason for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would draw a distinction between those two things without speculating about what path Congress will take.\u201d Josh Earnest, White House press secretary\n\nThe government shut down in October 2013 for 15 days after Republicans led by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, now a presidential candidate, balked at providing money to enact the Affordable Care Act. Battered by negative publicity as national parks closed and hundreds of thousands of federal employees and contractors were furloughed, Republicans relented and sent Obama legislation that re-opened the government and allowed the health-care law known as Obamacare to advance.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\n\nThis year, Cruz and other Republicans have threatened to hold up a budget unless it cuts off federal support for Planned Parenthood, the women\u2019s health service. An antiabortion group, the Center for Medical Progress, has released hidden-camera videos of Planned Parenthood executives discussing reimbursement for donating aborted fetal tissue to researchers, inflaming conservatives who have accused the group of selling body parts.\n\nObama has threatened to veto all of the 2016 spending bills the House and Senate have produced so far.\n\nLawmakers also face a busy September schedule including a vote on the nuclear accord with Iran and an address by Pope Francis that allows little time for difficult budget negotiations. That has raised speculation that Congress will pass a short-term law called a continuing resolution to keep the government running until a broader deal can be struck later in the year.\n\nEarnest wouldn\u2019t predict how Congress would handle the budget, but didn\u2019t rule out the president signing a short-term bill, even if it temporarily maintains spending at sequester levels.\n\n\u201cObviously, there\u2019s a difference between a temporary bill that would be put into place to allow Congress to get the additional time that\u2019s necessary to pass a longer-term budget,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cI would draw a distinction between those two things without speculating about what path Congress will take.\u201d\n\nWaiting to pass a full-year budget may also allow congressional leaders to incorporate other politically sensitive issues into the legislation, including an increase of the nation\u2019s debt limit and money for highway projects.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Justin Sink", "description": "The White House warned Tuesday against a shutdown of the U.S. government, as President Barack Obama\u2019s spokesman insisted he would not sign a fiscal 2016 budget that locks in automatic spending cuts known as the sequester.", "parsely-section": "politics", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iEp4FqIrwEqU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "The White House warned Tuesday against a shutdown of the U.S. government, as President Barack Obama\u2019s spokesman insisted he would not sign a fiscal 2016 budget that locks in automatic spending cuts known as the sequester.", "title": "Budget Dispute May Cause Government Shutdown, White House Warns", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-09-08/budget-dispute-may-cause-government-shutdown-white-house-warns", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iEp4FqIrwEqU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "The White House warned Tuesday against a shutdown of the U.S. government, as President Barack Obama\u2019s spokesman insisted he would not sign a fiscal 2016 budget that locks in automatic spending cuts known as the sequester.", "title": "Budget Dispute May Cause Government Shutdown, White House Warns", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-09-08/budget-dispute-may-cause-government-shutdown-white-house-warns", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iEp4FqIrwEqU/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "The White House warned Tuesday against a shutdown of the U.S. government, as President Barack Obama\u2019s spokesman insisted he would not sign a fiscal 2016 budget that locks in automatic spending cuts known as the sequester."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Budget Dispute May Cause Government Shutdown, White House Warns", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NUDF516KLVRI01", "parsely-author": "Justin Sink", "date": "2015-09-08T19:53:30.619Z", "keywords": "Barack H Obama,White House,Congress", "parsely-type": "post", "news_keywords": "Barack H Obama,White House,Congress", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-09-08T19:53:30.619Z", "parsely-tags": "Barack H Obama,White House,Congress,Region: Global,Page: article", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-09-08/budget-dispute-may-cause-government-shutdown-white-house-warns"}, "article_summary": "Obama has threatened to veto all of the 2016 spending bills the House and Senate have produced so far.\nThe White House warned Tuesday against a shutdown of the U.S. government, as President Barack Obama\u2019s spokesman insisted he would not sign a fiscal 2016 budget that locks in automatic spending cuts known as the sequester.\nHe said Republicans wouldn\u2019t be able to extend spending caps into 2016 and called on them to negotiate.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not at all clear to me that there is enough support in the United States Congress to pass a budget that would lock in sequester spending,\u201d Earnest said.\n\u201cObviously, there\u2019s a difference between a temporary bill that would be put into place to allow Congress to get the additional time that\u2019s necessary to pass a longer-term budget,\u201d Earnest said."}
