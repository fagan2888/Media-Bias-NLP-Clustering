Ann Kirkpatrick (D-Ariz.) doesn't have a head in the latest attack ad against her -- just a pair of legs, some high heels, and a lot of \"baggage.\"\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee released an ad on Monday that features a thin model -- apparently intended to represent Kirkpatrick -- strutting back and forth across the screen in heels with a suitcase on wheels. Her head and shoulders are cut off in the shot throughout the 30-second ad, and the female voice in the background says Kirkpatrick \"carries a lot of baggage.\"\n\n\"She's not independent -- she just votes the party line,\" the voice in ad says. \"Ann Kirkpatrick: too much baggage.\"\n\nThe ad's main charges seem to be that Kirkpatrick is a woman and that she supports President Barack Obama. It includes soundbites of Kirkpatrick noting that she likes the Affordable Care Act and is \"not going to second guess the President.\"\n\nThe charges are a bit odd, given that a 2013 National Journal analysis named Kirkpatrick as one of the top 10 Democrats in Congress most likely to buck her party.\n\nEmily's List, a progressive political action committee dedicated to electing pro-choice Democratic women, is supporting Kirkpatrick against her challenger, Arizona House Majority Whip Andy Tobin. A spokeswoman for Emily's List said she is not surprised the NRCC made a gendered attack on Kirkpatrick.\n\n\u201cGiven that Andy Tobin is one of the very worst of the bunch when it comes to women\u2019s issues, it\u2019s troubling Republicans used a disembodied woman\u2019s legs to attack his opponent,\" Jess McIntosh told HuffPost. \"Maybe addressing women\u2019s issues head on -- which would include a face -- is just too tough for these guys.\u201d\n\nAlso on HuffPost: GOP Women In Congress GOP Women In Congress\n\n1 of 23 Sen.
