U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley is likely sweating it after a remark about the lack of towel service at an exclusive gym that has remained open to lawmakers during the government shutdown.The Iowa congressman defended the backlash for the gym's continued operation, while thousands of government employees are furloughed, including workers at the fitness center.He said on the "Bill Press Show:" "There's hardly anybody working down there. There's no towel service. So we're doing our own laundry down there. And we pay a fee to belong to the House gym. So this is no different than if you're working for an employer that offers a wellness program, you pay a fee to belong. That's what we do there."Braley's comments have been mocked by late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, who aired a spot depicting sweaty actors playing congressmen to show their "sacrifice."Seated with pixelation hiding their genitals, the actors end the spoof by saying, "We go without towels because sacrifices must be made. Congress, wet because we care." The spot ends with the graphic: "Paid for by money saved furloughing non-essential NASA employees."During the shutdown, national parks, museums, and Head Start programs have been suspended, while the gym stays open Republicans running for U.S. Senate in Iowa took shots as well.Matt Whitaker said he'll "bring my own towels" if elected, while Sam Clovis said, "Towel service? Really? How out of touch with the people of Iowa can one person be?"
