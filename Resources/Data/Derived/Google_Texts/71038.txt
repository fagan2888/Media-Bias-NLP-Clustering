Dr. Lucille Ijoy, an 84-year-old grandmother from Philadelphia, really likes President Obama. So she made a rap video for him.

Ijoy says she’s been a fan of Obama since 2008, and as his presidency winds down, she wanted to express her gratitude through song. “I sit in here my rocking chair, my mind begins to wander / Grandmom thinks it’s time to say thank you to Obama,” she raps.

Now that “Grandmomma gets funky for Obama!” has been viewed nearly 150,000 times on Facebook, Ijoy is encouraging others to thank the president for his service too. “Put your pen or pencil or social media right where your mouth is,” she told me over the phone Tuesday morning.

Ijoy says she doesn’t expect to see another black president in her lifetime, and she’s concerned about the state of politics as we enter the next presidency. “People of different genders and women and immigrants are being excluded,” she said. “It’s fueling vitriol, and that’s going to be sad.”

Below is a conversation, edited for length and clarity, with Dr. Ijoy, a family therapist whose website is appropriately named listentograndmomma.com.

Dr. Ijoy, this isn’t your first musical tribute to the president. A few months ago, your granddaughter Lucille, who is a dear friend of mine, sent around “President Obama, You’re Doing a Realllllll Good Job.” It’s my personal favorite.

Oh, yes. I got a letter from the president and his wife and two daughters and Sunny and Bo thanking me. Just a nice letter. I also did buttons—I’m going to send a whole box to Lucille. The buttons say, “President Obama, you’re doing a realllllll good job.” And the president sent a thank you note for those, too.
