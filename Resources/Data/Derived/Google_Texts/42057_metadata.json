Princip killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and his wife. The political upheaval touched off by those assassinations took millions of lives, redrew the map of the world, changed the rules of war forever\u2026 and fundamentally altered the status of American Indians in U.S. law.\n\nMuch of the U.S. media has been running pieces leading up to July 28, the centennial of what used to be called the Great War until WWII came along. After a month of threats back and forth in response to the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, which triggered mutual defense treaties, one after the other, until Europeans began to speak of \u201cthe world\u201d being at war. Europe was, after all, in their minds, synonymous with \u201cthe world.\u201d\n\nAustria-Hungary\u2019s alliance, the Central Powers, included Germany and the Ottoman Empire. On the other side were the Allied Powers: Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy, and Japan. All of these powers, Central and Allied, had imperial interests. After three years of carnage, the United States joined the Allied Powers in what was by that time too big a war to fight with volunteers.\n\nOn May 28, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson signed a proclamation authorizing conscription of all males between the ages of 21 and 30. As a matter of law, that would be all males who were U.S. citizens (although non-citizens were required to register), and at the time Indians were not generally considered citizens. The distinction in the Constitution of \u201cIndians not taxed\u201d was not understood in a uniform manner, but generally the idea was that Indians maintaining tribal relations were citizens of their tribal nations, but Indians who did not were still the wrong color to be U.S. citizens.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Affairs enforced the requirement that Indians register with some vigor, setting up draft boards on each reservation. Dr. Carlos Montezuma (Yavapai) wrote of the peculiar status of Indians in 1917: \u201cThey are not citizens. They have fewer privileges than have foreigners. They are wards of the United States of America without their consent or the chance of protest on their part.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The political upheaval touched off by the assassinations by Gavrilo Princip to start World War I altered the status of American Indians in U.S. law.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.creator": "kpolisse", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/07/great-war-showed-world-horror-total-war-natives-knew-too-well-155686", "type": "article", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/reproduction_of_a_london_newspaper_of_front_page_from_1914_-_charlie_riedel_ap_photo.jpg", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "title": "The Great War Showed World the Horror of Total War Natives Knew Too Well"}, "dcterms.date": "2014-07-07T10:00-04:00", "dc": {"title": "The Great War Showed World the Horror of Total War Natives Knew Too Well"}, "dcterms.identifier": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/07/07/great-war-showed-world-horror-total-war-natives-knew-too-well-155686", "robots": "follow, index", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "fb": {"app_id": 493888563989950}, "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "World War I, Gavrilo Princip, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Austro-Hungarian Empire, Native American Citizenship, Ottoman Empire, Central Powers, President Woodrow Wilson, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Dr. Carlos Montezuma, New Echota, Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, World War I enlistment, President Calvin Coolidge, Indian Citizenship Act, Great War, Steve Russell", "validation_code": "d9d37d7b776cc351c4025ded3df21cad", "sioc": {"num_replies": 1}, "dcterms.title": "The Great War Showed World the Horror of Total War Natives Knew Too Well"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc992\"", "article_summary": "On the other side were the Allied Powers: Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy, and Japan.\nAfter three years of carnage, the United States joined the Allied Powers in what was by that time too big a war to fight with volunteers.\nDr. Carlos Montezuma (Yavapai) wrote of the peculiar status of Indians in 1917: \u201cThey are not citizens.\nThey are wards of the United States of America without their consent or the chance of protest on their part.\u201d\nMuch of the U.S. media has been running pieces leading up to July 28, the centennial of what used to be called the Great War until WWII came along."}
