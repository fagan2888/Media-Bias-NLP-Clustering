Orangemania will carry the day for Super Bowl XLVIII. It’s the AFC’s turn to be designated the home team — so the Broncos will wear their home orange jerseys agaisnt Seattle.

The last two times the Broncos were in the Super Bowl, they wore their home blue to beat Green Bay in Super Bowl XXXII (1997 season) and then road white for John Elway’s final game as quarterback in Super Bowl XXXIII (1998 season) against the Atlanta Falcons.

The Broncos are 9-1 this season in orange jerseys. Denver wore blue jerseys just once this season – a road victory at Dallas against the Cowboys.
