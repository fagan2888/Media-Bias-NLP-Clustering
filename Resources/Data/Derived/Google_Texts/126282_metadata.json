(WHTM) \u2013 Wednesday brought more than the typical rush hour traffic down South Front Street in Steelton.\n\n\u201cWhat do we want?\u201d Steelworkers employed by ArcelorMittal boomed over loudspeakers.\n\n\u201cA fair contract!\u201d the crowd continued. \u201cWhen do we want it?\u201d\n\nCar horns blared in shows of support as people drove through Steelton.\n\n\u201cNow!\u201d The resounding cry continued for 20 minutes as dozens of steel workers stood on the sidewalk.\n\nA bargaining committee for the United Steelworkers union is in the midst of negotiations with two companies employing 30,000 steelworkers \u2013 U.S. Steel, and ArcelorMittal, which has a plant in Steelton.\n\n\u201cRight now we do not pay anything for our healthcare,\u201d USW Local 1688 Vice President Pat McHugh said. \u201cWe do not want to pay the outrageous price they\u2019re suggesting.\u201d\n\nThat price would be a monthly healthcare premium of $150 for individuals, $250 for families, along with a wage freeze.\n\n\u201cHey hey! Ho ho! Corporate greed has got to go!\u201d The chants continued as more drivers waved and cheered at the workers.\n\nIs it greed, or is it survival in a struggling industry? That\u2019s the crux of the contract disagreement. The steel companies say they have no choice \u2013 reports show steel prices in the U.S. have dropped more than 20 percent since January. But workers say they\u2019re not buying it.\n\n\u201cHere in Steelton, we know they\u2019re making money,\u201d McHugh said. \u201cAnd they have been making money. And we know that their profits for the last eight years have been very good. and they\u2019ve put a lot of money into this plant.\u201d\n\nabc27 called ArcelorMittal to ask whether that\u2019s true. No one called back. Information on GlassDoor.com shows average salaries hover between $55,000 and $90,000 per year.\n\n\u201cthey say we make a lot of money, but in order to make a lot of money in the steel industry you have to work a lot of overtime,\u201d McHugh said.\n\nThe debate continues, but the steelworkers say community support is on their side.\n\n\u201cSteelton\u2019s a tight-knit community,\u201d McHugh said. \u201cAnd we have a lot of retirees in this community.\u201d\n\nSteel worker retirees say their healthcare is on the chopping block, too.\n\n\u201cI need that plan,\u201d retired local union president Greg Bowers said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go out and pay three or 400 dollars for a plan when I got a good plan that covers all my medical healthcare.\u201d\n\nBowers says the rally is a sign of hope.\n\n\u201cIt uplifts them,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cIt gives them that added strength to continue the fight.\u201d\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle\n\nPocket\n\nEmail\n\nPrint\n\nMore\n\nPinterest\n\nLike this: Like Loading...", "article_metadata": {"description": "Wednesday brought more than the typical rush hour traffic down South Front Street in Steelton.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=394896224", "og": {"site_name": "ABC27", "description": "Wednesday brought more than the typical rush hour traffic down South Front Street in Steelton.", "title": "Greed or survival?
