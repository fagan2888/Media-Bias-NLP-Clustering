To stay alive, they depend on machines and tubes and the caregivers sent out by an agency called Children First.\n\nRegistered nurse Maria Schiavi, co-owner of Children First, says some of the kids they care for were injured in an accident, such as a near-drowning. Others were born with life-threatening problems that modern medicine can\u2019t fix.\n\n\u201cThis is little Juvens; he is about the size of a newborn even though he's about five months old.. Are you listening to me? Yes! He is unfortunately going to need a tracheostomy and he'll also need a ventilator...\" she said as machinery noise fills the room.\n\n\"This is our little girl Yamaria. Yamaria\u2019s on full life support system. She suffered a near SIDS. She has a tracheostomy, as you see, she\u2019s hooked to a life-support ventilator, she does have a feeding tube in her stomach.\u201d\n\nYamaria gives no sign she knows we\u2019re there. She\u2019s in a coma. We move on to another room, another 4-year-old girl. This one is conscious, aware of her surroundings. But she can\u2019t move. She can\u2019t talk.\n\n\u201cThis is the oxygen concentrator that supplies a continual flow of oxygen to our Angel, who is totally ventilator-dependent, due to her diagnosis, which is spinal muscular atrophy. She's watching..this is her portable DVD that her grandpa gave her. --I don\u2019t know that movie -\u2013 she fully understands, she cannot verbalize, no,\" Schiavi said. \"This part of the disease process is very unfortunate. She seems as though she\u2019s frozen.\u201d\n\nThese children don\u2019t know it, but their world is changing. The state of Florida\u2019s Medicaid system has moved each of them into an HMO, and most have turned their home care decisions over to another company, Univita Health. By the end of the month the children may have a whole different set of nurses and therapists, maybe a different home. It depends on how Univita decides to handle it.\n\nThey\u2019ll be customers of a company that is willing to provide their services and medical equipment for whatever is the low bid. Schiavi\u2019s partner at Children First, who handles negotiations with HMOs, is Donna Loggie.\n\nShe says all the Medicaid HMOs around Orlando and much of Florida are contracting with the same company, Univita Health, to handle their home medical equipment, called DME.\n\n\u201cThey offered the Medicaid DME providers around the state 50 percent of the Medicaid fee schedule,\u201d she said.\n\nIn other words, a $100 payment under traditional Medicaid would now pay only $50.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a provider in FLorida that could sustain doing business with 50 percent of the current Medicaid fee schedule,\" Loggie said.\n\nShe told Univita how sick the children here are, how much high-tech equipment they need, and how much training the staff must have. She asked: Can we negotiate?\n\n\u201cAnd Univita\u2019s response was, \u2018Well, that\u2019s what we\u2019re offering. You can take that or leave that.. And we left that,\u201d she said.\n\nHome care providers say Univita has a conflict of interest because it has its own home care division.\n\nMichael Muchnicki, Univita\u2019s president and CEO, says he can\u2019t discuss contracts and payments, that those are trade secrets, kept confidential.\n\nJustin Senior, Medicaid director for Florida, says the whole point of shifting to statewide managed care is to bring costs under better control in an industry long known for abuse and fraud. Bidding should make it clear what a fair price is, he says.\n\n\u201cWhat the legislators wrote was that any provider could participate in the program if they're a DME provider as long as they agree to the lowest price that any other DME provider meets in the region, as long as they met applicable quality standards,\" Senior siad.\n\n\"If Univita enters into a dirt-cheap contract with itself, it cannot then use that dirt-cheap contract as the lowest price agreed to by another provider in the area. That's the first type of gaming that we said, 'That is not going to be permitted.'\"\n\nSenior says Medicaid\u2019s competitive bidding resembles what Medicare has been doing; government reports show bidding dropped medical equipment prices for Medicare by $400 million in the first round of bidding.\n\n\"For several years now, the Medicaid rates in Florida in those metro areas have been significantly higher than Medicare rates, around 40 percent,\" he said.\n\n\n\nSenior says Medicaid will watch for complaints and will be doing consumer report cards that reflect HMO member surveys. But the small suppliers like Children First feel the game is rigged against them.\n\n\n\nSee related story: Home-Care Firm Rules Medicaid Market.\n\n--Health News Florida is part of WUSF Public Media.
