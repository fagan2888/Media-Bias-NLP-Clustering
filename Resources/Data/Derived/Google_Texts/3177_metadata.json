Similarly, a three-person household that has lived in a New Bedford, Mass., housing authority apartment since 2003 currently draws an annual income of $212,845.\n\nOn the face of it, this would appear to be a massive rip-off of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which subsidizes state and local public housing authorities. Roughly 1.1 million families receive public housing assistance through 3,300 public housing authorities.\n\nThe housing is meant for poor or low income families with incomes of between 50 percent and 80 percent of the median income of the metropolitan area. In Los Angeles, for example, the income threshold for a family of five is $70,450 a year, while in New York City it is $67,100.\n\nHowever, according to a new HUD inspector general\u2019s report, public housing authorities provide housing assistance to as many as 25,226 families whose income exceeded HUD\u2019s 2014 eligibility income limits \u2013 sometimes by large amounts. Nearly 18,000 of those families had incomes that exceeded the qualifying levels for more than a year.\n\nRelated: HUD Execs Flagged for Ethics, Lobbying Violations\n\nThis year, HUD \u2013 which has been criticized in the past for its mishandling of funds \u2013 will spend $104.4 million in the coming year subsidizing so-called \u201cover-income\u201d families.\n\nIn the case of the New York family with an annual income of just under $500,000, they were being provided with publicly subsidized housing while more than 300,000 low income families waited on lengthy waiting lists, according to the study.\n\nHUD officials have no plans to oust these better-off families from their housing projects, mainly because the department\u2019s policy doesn\u2019t require over-income tenants to leave. In fact, inspectors learned, many housing authorities encourage wealthier tenants to stay in public housing, in part because it helps to stabilize and diversify the tenant population.\n\nUnder federal rules, families only have to meet the income eligibility requirements upon admission to a public housing project, according to the report. There is no limit to the length of time that families can remain public housing \u2013 regardless of changes in their income status \u2013 provided that they follow the rules.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "While hundreds of thousands of low income families are desperately trying to find adeq", "title": "Why Is HUD Spending $100 Million on People Who No Longer Qualify for Public Housing?", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/18/Why-HUD-Spending-100-Million-People-Who-No-Longer-Qualify-Public-Housing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/01202012_Hottest_Housing_Brooklyn_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/08/18/Why-HUD-Spending-100-Million-People-Who-No-Longer-Qualify-Public-Housing", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/01202012_Hottest_Housing_Brooklyn_slideshow.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "While hundreds of thousands of low income families are desperately trying to find adeq", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Roughly 1.1 million families receive public housing assistance through 3,300 public housing authorities.\nIn fact, inspectors learned, many housing authorities encourage wealthier tenants to stay in public housing, in part because it helps to stabilize and diversify the tenant population.\nOn the face of it, this would appear to be a massive rip-off of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which subsidizes state and local public housing authorities.\nUnder federal rules, families only have to meet the income eligibility requirements upon admission to a public housing project, according to the report.\nHowever, according to a new HUD inspector general\u2019s report, public housing authorities provide housing assistance to as many as 25,226 families whose income exceeded HUD\u2019s 2014 eligibility income limits \u2013 sometimes by large amounts."}
