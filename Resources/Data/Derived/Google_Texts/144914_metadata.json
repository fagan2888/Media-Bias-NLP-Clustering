Reasons:\n\nMany have access to credit cards and checkbooks \u2013 their own or held jointly with a parent \u2013 and, typically, a clean credit history that\u2019s attractive to ID thieves. But they\u2019re less likely than older folks to monitor their financial accounts.\n\nThey\u2019re the most frequent and active users of social media and are more likely to post birthdates, hometowns and other personal information that can be pieced together by Facebook-trawling identity thieves.\n\nWhen victimized, they take longer to detect identity theft. Past studies have found that those ages 18 to 24 take an average of 132 days to discover they\u2019ve been scammed \u2013 five times longer than the national average. Because of this delay, their financial losses have also been higher than those of older ID theft victims.\n\nMaybe this explains why computer systems of universities are popular targets for cybercrooks.\n\nSo far this year, nearly 840,000 personal records were exposed in breach attacks against no fewer than 12 universities \u2013 including the University of Maryland, Indiana University, Johns Hopkins University, Iowa State, the University of Minnesota, Auburn University College of Business, a campus of the University of Wisconsin, Loyola Law School and the North Dakota University System.\n\nMeanwhile, during the same period, fewer than 5,000 records were hacked in 10 data breaches of financial institutions, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center, which keeps tabs on reported breaches.\n\nTo reduce ID theft risk, teach your offspring to take the same protective measures as you do. That means:\n\nMonitoring their financial accounts, quickly and regularly. In addition to carefully reviewing bank and credit card statements for fraudulent charges, college students (like all Americans) should take advantage of the three free reports they are entitled to per 12-month period at www.annualcreditreport.com.\n\nKeeping checkbooks, bank and credit card statements, passports, and anything else with account numbers or other personally identifiable information (PII) in a locked filing cabinet, not a desk drawer. Ideally, sensitive documents, including credit card statements, should be mailed to the parents\u2019 home or a PO Box; dorm and apartment mailboxes may not be secure.\n\nSecurely storing computers, smartphones and tablets (dorm rooms, in particular, can have \u201copen door\u201d access) when not carrying them. These devices should also be locked with PINs, and employ different passwords on different accounts. Security software should be installed and regularly updated, and data should be encrypted, especially on smartphones. How-to info should be in the owner\u2019s manual or on the manufacturer\u2019s website.\n\nAvoiding Wi-Fi networks when shopping online \u2013 and never leaving payment cards \u201con file\u201d at websites, in case a company is subject to a data breach. In general, it\u2019s safer to use retailers\u2019 dedicated apps than the phone\u2019s browser.\n\nReading reviews before installing apps and sticking with trusted vendors, such as Apple\u2019s App Store.\n\nDeclining free downloads for games, music and screen savers, and not opening links from strangers \u2013 especially those promising nude photos or videos of celebrities. All are popular ways to install malware.\n\nRealizing that social networks like Facebook can be a gold mine for identity theives. Studies show that commonly shared information, such as birthdates and birthplaces, can be used to accurately guess most digits in a Social Security number. A pet\u2019s name (often broadcast by young adults) is often used as a security question at websites \u2013 and also as an account password by young people. And hackers know this.\n\nAdjusting privacy settings on social network sites to make it difficult for strangers to view accounts or post material on your page.\n\nUsing credit cards, which offer stronger liability protection, rather than debit cards. When using a debit card, especially at gas stations, choose the \u201ccredit\u201d option that doesn\u2019t require a PIN.\n\nShredding solicitations for preapproved credit cards and opting out of such offers at https://www.optoutprescreen.com.\n\nFor information about other scams, sign up for the Fraud Watch Network.
