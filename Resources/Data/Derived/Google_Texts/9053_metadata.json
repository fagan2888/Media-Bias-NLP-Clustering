The move comes after several years of the Chinese government slowly relaxing the 35-year-old mandate.\n\nThe most recent policy modification came last year, when Chinese men and women who are only children were told that they could apply for a second birth permit, the government-issued allowance necessary for pregnancy.\n\nThe two-child policy announcement comes after a four-day-long meeting between the Communist Party\u2019s Central Committee officials in Beijing. The meeting\u2019s communiqu\u00e9, or minutes, offer insight into the decision.\n\n\u201cImprove the demographic development strategy,\u201d the document reads according to the New York Times. \u201cComprehensively implement a policy that couples can have two children, actively taking steps to counter the aging of the population.\u201d\n\nIn effect, the shift signals a Chinese acknowledgement of the country\u2019s aging labor force and essential demographic crisis.\n\n\u201cChina has been struggling economically, and I think it\u2019s more revealing in terms of what they\u2019re really worried about, which is their economy, instead of any sort of attempt to help their people,\u201d says Olivia Enos, a research associate with The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Asian Studies Center.\n\nIndeed, China has a long history of manipulating fertility, ranging from the \u201clonger, later, fewer\u201d policies of the late 1970s, which encouraged fewer births, to Mao Zedong\u2019s practice of rewarding population expansion with food incentives in an attempt to ensure Chinese dominance.\n\nAccording to Enos, the Chinese workforce has decreased by an estimated 35 percent at the same time as China\u2019s aging population has increased by roughly 60 percent, as a result of the one-child policy.\n\nMoreover, due to the advent of sex-selective abortion, China has an \u201cexcess\u201d of roughly 17 million marriage-aged men who lack a female counterpart, according to Sarah Torre, a policy analyst for The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Institute for Family, Community, and Opportunity.\n\n\u201cIf those men aren\u2019t settling down and getting married, they\u2019re not having a first, let alone a second, child,\u201d Torre says, adding that the demographic catastrophe has also led to an increase in sex and bride trafficking of women from surrounding nations, in addition to the reported human rights abuses enacted against China\u2019s own people by the Chinese government.\n\nAccording to Torre, those abuses include forced abortion and sterilization, enacted by China\u2019s \u201c500,000-person family planning control apparatus.\u201d\n\nWhile it remains to be seen if the policy overhaul will produce long-term intended results\u2013including a growing working and female population\u2014a glimpse into the future has perhaps been offered by those certain Chinese communities, usually rural, who have been allowed to have two children in recent years and have seemingly chosen not to do so.\n\n\u201cPart of the reason I would imagine China has done this is because their earlier tweak to the policy a couple years ago allowing only children to have two children didn\u2019t produce many additional births,\u201d Torre says, estimating that that change contributed an additional one million within the context of 16 million births annually.\n\nWhile a Chinese migration out of rural areas and into expensive cities could be a deterrent for having a second child, Enos offers another take.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re told for so many years that one child is the ideal, at some point, you\u2019re probably going to buy it,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy would it one day be the most ideal thing ever, and then the next day not? To some extent it\u2019s just a revelation of the fact that the propaganda worked.\u201d\n\n\u201cChina just needs to get out of the family business, period,\u201d she adds.", "article_metadata": {"description": "China is abandoning its controversial \u201cone-child policy\u201d in favor of a universal two-child policy, according to Chinese news agency Xinhua.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "China is abandoning its controversial \u201cone-child policy\u201d in favor of a universal two-child policy, according to Chinese news agency Xinhua.", "title": "As China Abandons One-Child Policy, Experts Agree Change Won\u2019t Be Enough to Avert Demographic Crisis", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/two-chinese-babies.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-29T21:58:57+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/20dyXjQ"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "China is abandoning its controversial \u201cone-child policy\u201d in favor of a universal two-child policy, according to Chinese news agency Xinhua.", "title": "As China Abandons One-Child Policy, Experts Agree Change Won\u2019t Be Enough to Avert Demographic Crisis", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/two-chinese-babies.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "International", "tag": "Asia", "published_time": "2015-10-29T13:59:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-29T21:58:57+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "China, one-child policy, two-child policy, babies, fertility, economy"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd843\"", "article_summary": "China is abandoning its controversial \u201cone-child policy\u201d in favor of a universal two-child policy, according to Chinese news agency Xinhua.\nThe two-child policy announcement comes after a four-day-long meeting between the Communist Party\u2019s Central Committee officials in Beijing.\nThe most recent policy modification came last year, when Chinese men and women who are only children were told that they could apply for a second birth permit, the government-issued allowance necessary for pregnancy.\nThe move comes after several years of the Chinese government slowly relaxing the 35-year-old mandate.\nWhile a Chinese migration out of rural areas and into expensive cities could be a deterrent for having a second child, Enos offers another take."}
