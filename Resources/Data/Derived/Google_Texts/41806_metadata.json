Bob Goodlatte, R-Va., says the president, \"doesn't have a debate in the Oval Office about what he wants to do,\" adding, \"he does what he wants to do, and then you no longer have representative democracy.\"\n\nGeorge Washington University law professor and Obama supporter Jonathan Turley says he's troubled by the expansion of executive power under both President George W. Bush and now President Obama.\n\n\"The problem of what the president is doing is that he is not simply posing a danger to the constitutional system; he is becoming the very danger the Constitution was designed to avoid: that is, the concentration of power in any single branch,\" he said.\n\nTurley's comments came as part of his testimony before the committee.\n\nArticle II of the U.S. Constitution calls on the president to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" Simon Lazarus, Senior Counsel for the Constitutional Accountability Center, says that's exactly what President Obama is doing by modifying the ACA so that the law can be successfully implemented.\n\nLazarus also testified before the committee.\n\n\"I have to say that hyperventilating about how extraordinary and unprecedented and unconstitutional these delays are is just that, it's hyperventilation and it\u2019s contrary to obvious historical fact,\" Lazarus said.\n\nThough experts testifying before the committee mentioned impeachment as the ultimate check on executive power, Republicans on the committee gave the idea no real consideration - given that the Senate is controlled by Democrats. They also expressed frustration that under current legal precedent it is virtually impossible for members to sue the executive branch.\n\nThe experts seemed unified in expressing to the committee that the one viable solution \"comes down to elections.\"", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/White House", "dcterms.modified": "2015-02-02 01:29:14 EST", "dcterms.abstract": "At a House Judiciary Committee hearing this week, GOP lawmakers repeatedly expressed frustration with the president's end runs around Congress on everything from non-enforcement of immigration laws to massive re-writes of the Affordable Care Act", "twitter": {"description": "At a House Judiciary Committee hearing this week, GOP lawmakers repeatedly expressed frustration with the president's end runs around Congress on everything from non-enforcement of immigration laws to massive re-writes of the Affordable Care Act", "creator": "@foxnews", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/05/obama-end-run-around-congress-sparks-bipartisan-criticism.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/120413/0/0/120413_sr_bream_640.jpg?ve=1", "title": "Obama's end-runs around Congress spark bipartisan criticism", "site": "@foxnews", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "parsely-metadata": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/White House\"],\"author\":\"Shannon Bream\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Obama\\\\u0027s end-runs around Congress spark bipartisan criticism\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/120413/0/0/120413_sr_bream_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-05T10:45:03Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/05/obama-end-run-around-congress-sparks-bipartisan-criticism.html\",\"type\":\"article\",\"identifier\":\"f7f2947a-a498-44b3-871c-98f5ac63368e\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "prism.channel": "fnc", "dc.description": "At a House Judiciary Committee hearing this week, GOP lawmakers repeatedly expressed frustration with the president's end runs around Congress on everything from non-enforcement of immigration laws to massive re-writes of the Affordable Care Act", "dc.identifier": "f7f2947a-a498-44b3-871c-98f5ac63368e", "dc.language": "en-US", "pagetype": "article", "classification-isa": "whitehouse", "description": "At a House Judiciary Committee hearing this week, GOP lawmakers repeatedly expressed frustration with the president's end runs around Congress on everything from non-enforcement of immigration laws to massive re-writes of the Affordable Care Act", "prism.section": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "dc.source": "FoxNews.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "dc.title": "Obama's End-runs Around Congress Spark Bipartisan Criticism", "dcterms.created": "2015-02-02 01:29:14 EST", "og": {"site_name": "Fox News", "description": "At a House Judiciary Committee hearing this week, GOP lawmakers repeatedly expressed frustration with the president's end runs around Congress on everything from non-enforcement of immigration laws to massive re-writes of the Affordable Care Act", "title": "Obama's end-runs around Congress spark bipartisan criticism | Fox News", "url": "http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/05/obama-end-run-around-congress-sparks-bipartisan-criticism.html", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/120413/0/0/120413_sr_bream_640.jpg?ve=1", "type": "article"}, "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.date": "2013-12-05", "parsely-page": "{\"tags\":[\"/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/EXECUTIVE/White House\"],\"author\":\"Shannon Bream\",\"subSection\":\"politics\",\"title\":\"Obama\\\\u0027s end-runs around Congress spark bipartisan criticism\",\"image_url\":\"http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/thumbnails/i/120413/0/0/120413_sr_bream_640.jpg?ve=1\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-12-05T10:45:03Z\",\"link\":\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/12/05/obama-end-run-around-congress-sparks-bipartisan-criticism.html\",\"post_id\":\"f7f2947a-a498-44b3-871c-98f5ac63368e\",\"type\":\"article\",\"section\":\"politics\"}", "dc.creator": "Shannon Bream"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc92a\"", "article_summary": "George Washington University law professor and Obama supporter Jonathan Turley says he's troubled by the expansion of executive power under both President George W.
