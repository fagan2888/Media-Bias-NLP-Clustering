Well, photographer Dwight Eschliman and author Steve Ettlinger are offering a new approach to how we view the processed foods we eat, that\u2019ll make you seriously rethink your next Insta-food post.\n\nTheir book, Ingredients: A Visual Exploration of 75 Additives and 25 Food Products, set to come out Sept. 29, offers a visual representation of all the ingredients and additives put in common processed foods we all enjoy.
