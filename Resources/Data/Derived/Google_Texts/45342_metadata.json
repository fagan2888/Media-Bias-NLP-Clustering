The Israelis were killed in random attacks in the street or on buses.\n\nIn the latest attack, a Palestinian stabbed and wounded an Israeli border policeman at the Qalandia crossing in the West Bank, a police spokesman said. The attacker was initially shot and wounded in the leg.\n\nDuring a follow-up body search, the attacker drew a second knife and tried to stab another officer, after which he was shot dead, the spokesman said.\n\nIn East Jerusalem and Hebron, two Palestinians who also attempted knife attacks were killed and another was seriously wounded, Israeli authorities said. One Israeli border policewoman was lightly wounded.\n\nA fourth Palestinian was shot dead, also in Hebron, but there were conflicting reports about the incident.\n\nIsrael's military said the Palestinian attempted to stab an Israeli civilian, who was carrying a gun and shot the attacker dead. A Palestinian man told Reuters that his daughter, a high school student, had seen the shooting and said it happened when Jewish settlers attacked an unarmed Palestinian.\n\nThere has also been violence along the Gaza-Israel border. Israel's army defused a rocket that it said had been fired by Gaza militants overnight and landed in an open area.\n\nPeace talks collapsed in 2014 over Israeli settlement-building in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, areas that the Palestinians seek for a state, and after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas angered Israel by reaching a unity deal with the Islamist group Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe last major armed confrontation was the Gaza conflict between Israel and Hamas in 2014, which left large sections of Gaza destroyed. Around 2,100 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and 73 Israelis, most of them soldiers, were killed.\n\nThe United States has stepped up efforts to try to restore calm. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke by phone with both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Abbas to discuss ways to end the violence.\n\nKerry and Netanyahu are due to meet next week in Germany.\n\n(Reporting by Ali Sawafta, Nidal al-Mughrabi, Ari Rabinovitch; Editing by Ros Russell)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Forty-one Palestinians and seven Israelis have died in the recent street violence, whi", "title": "Israel says more knife attacks thwarted, four Palestinians dead", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/17/Two-Palestinian-stabbings-thwarted-attackers-killed-Israel", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/israel-palestinians_3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2015/10/17/Two-Palestinian-stabbings-thwarted-attackers-killed-Israel", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/israel-palestinians_3.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Forty-one Palestinians and seven Israelis have died in the recent street violence, whi", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb785\"", "article_summary": "In East Jerusalem and Hebron, two Palestinians who also attempted knife attacks were killed and another was seriously wounded, Israeli authorities said.\nDuring a follow-up body search, the attacker drew a second knife and tried to stab another officer, after which he was shot dead, the spokesman said.\nThe Palestinian dead include attackers wielding knives and protesters shot by Israeli forces as they threw rocks.\nA fourth Palestinian was shot dead, also in Hebron, but there were conflicting reports about the incident.\nIn the latest attack, a Palestinian stabbed and wounded an Israeli border policeman at the Qalandia crossing in the West Bank, a police spokesman said."}
