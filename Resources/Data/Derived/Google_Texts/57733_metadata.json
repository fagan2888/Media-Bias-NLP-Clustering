All indications throughout the past month may prove that the GOP is using the media and established politicians, both past and present, to ease the anger which most Americans are feeling as a product of an embarrassing Republican Party.\n\nSen. Bob Coker (R-TN) weighed in on this notion in statement released Thursday.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s my message to the Republican Party leaders: Focus more on listening to the American people and less on trying to stifle their voice.\"\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in the Republican primary is the result of two things: the fecklessness and ineptness of the Washington establishment in failing to address the big issues facing our country and years of anger with the overreach of the Obama administration. And to be candid, I think the American people should be angrier than they are.\u201d\n\nThe GOP started off this election cycle with a peaceful offering of Jeb Bush as the Republican nominee. The American people rejected that notion with rage and now the GOP is using a different tactic. Instead of a peaceful offering, they have decided to forcefully put forth Marco Rubio in hopes that this 'new plan' will actually work this time. Fortunately for the American people, the GOP cannot win at anything.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Senator Bob Corker Issues Statement on Presidential Race - Justin Holcomb : Is the Republican Party becoming its own worst enemy? \u00a0All .05/27/2016 8:03:02AM EST.", "author": "Justin Holcomb", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/justinholcomb/2016/03/04/senator-bob-corker-issues-statement-on-presidential-race-n2128775", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/4/5.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Justin Holcomb  - Senator Bob Corker Issues Statement on Presidential Race"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/justinholcomb/2016/03/04/senator-bob-corker-issues-statement-on-presidential-race-n2128775", "site_name": "Townhall", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/uploads/2016/3/4/5.jpg", "type": "Article", "title": "Justin Holcomb  - Senator Bob Corker Issues Statement on Presidential Race"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Senator Bob Corker Issues Statement on Presidential Race, Justin Holcomb , Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Is the Republican Party becoming its own worst enemy?\nInstead of a peaceful offering, they have decided to forcefully put forth Marco Rubio in hopes that this 'new plan' will actually work this time.\n\u201cHere\u2019s my message to the Republican Party leaders: Focus more on listening to the American people and less on trying to stifle their voice.\"\nThe American people rejected that notion with rage and now the GOP is using a different tactic.\nSen.
