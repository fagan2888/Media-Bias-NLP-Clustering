(CASSIDY SWANSON/Union Leader Correspondent)\n\nBow approves full-day kindergarten starting next year\n\n\n\nResidents approved a warrant article to implement full-day kindergarten at Bow Elementary School by a margin of 68 votes, despite the measure not having the endorsement of the school board or the budget committee.\n\n..\n\nThe petition warrant article asked the district to raise and appropriate $359,036 to make kindergarten classes full-day, to be paid for with tax dollars. The average estimated tax impact for a home in Bow valued at $250,000 is $85.13 annually.\n\n..\n\nIn 2014, the district charged a kindergarten committee with investigating the viability of full-day kindergarten and making a recommendation back to the board. The committee was in favor of switching to full-day for the 2015-16 school year.\n\n..\n\nDanielle Albushies, a parent who served on the committee, told the crowd that 76 percent of children enrolled in kindergarten nationwide are in school all day. Forty-one percent of New Hampshire\u2019s kindergarteners attend full-day programs in districts including Hanover, Hopkinton, Boscawen and Penacook.\n\n..\n\n\u201cYou can see with these numbers, which have increased over time, that it\u2019s becoming the norm, rather than the exception,\u201d Albushies said, adding that Canterbury, Belmont, Plainfield, Cornish and Mont Vernon have recently approved implementing full-day kindergarten.\n\n..\n\nKelly Wood, a Bow kindergarten teacher who also served on the committee, said the district\u2019s current half-day program of two hours and 35 minutes \u201cpresents scheduling challenges\u201d for teachers.\n\n\n\n\u201cMany curriculums are written around a full day, so teachers have to decide which components are the most essential to implement,\u201d she said. Wood also said the longer school day would create a more relaxed environment and improve communication between the school and families.\n\n..\n\n\u201cFor the community, it means improving the quality of our school and attracting young families,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIn addition, early intervention may pay off in the long run by reducing the need for more costly services later on.\u201d\n\n..\n\nSchool Board Chairman Robert Louf said implementing full-day kindergarten is a \u201cmultifaceted issue.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very tough to boil it down to down to just yes or no,\u201d Louf said. \u201cI do support the program and everything that we\u2019ve seen that is relative to the program. It\u2019s that second piece, at cost to the district, that makes me very nervous.\u201d\n\n..\n\nJared Bland said full-day kindergarten represented \u201cthe future for Bow.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDo you guys really want to be satisfied with the status quo and with \u2018good enough,\u2019 or should we be striving for more?\u201d he asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think this is something that we can\u2019t afford. I think this is something that we need to afford.\u201d\n\n..\n\nDon Berube said he was \u201cdefinitely not for this\u201d warrant article, especially because it did not have the backing of the school board.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to pay for people\u2019s day care,\u201d Berube said. \u201cI don\u2019t see where the extra instruction makes (the children) that much more of a student in the following year after kindergarten.\u201d\n\n..\n\nLinda Jordan, who has seven grandchildren in Bow public schools, said she had \u201cwatched the struggles\u201d associated with the current half-day program, especially with dropping children off at school only to have to pick them up less than three hours later, often requiring their parents to leave work.\n\n..\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great inconvenience for very little amount of money, to be able to help our children get a better start,\u201d Jordan said.\n\n\n\nMargaret Welch, who lives on Bow Center Road, said the town of Bow has \u201ctremendous decisions\u201d before it at this time, like the potential $5 million public safety complex, making full-day kindergarten a lower priority.\n\n..\n\n\u201cWe have more than enough to consider, and I\u2019m afraid that I don\u2019t support this at this time,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nResidents voted via paper ballot and the measure passed 197 to 129.\n\n\n\ncswanson@newstote.com\n\n..", "article_metadata": {"description": "Residents approved a warrant article to implement full-day kindergarten at Bow Elementary School by a margin of 68 votes, despite the measure not having the endorsement of the school board or the budget committee.", "title": "Bow approves full-day kindergarten starting next year | New Hampshire", "og": {"site_name": "UnionLeader.com", "description": "Residents approved a warrant article to implement full-day kindergarten at Bow Elementary School by a margin of 68 votes, despite the measure not having the endorsement of the school board or the budget committee.", "title": "Bow approves full-day kindergarten starting next year | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150315/NEWS0612/150319340/-1/services01", "image": {"width": 600, "identifier": "http://www.unionleader.com/storyimage/UL/20150315/NEWS0612/150319340/AR/0/AR-150319340.jpg?q=70?ExactW=600&ExactH=314&imageversion=MainHighlight&q=80", "height": 314}, "type": "article"}, "section": "Town Meetings", "robots": "NOARCHIVE, NOODP, NOYDIR", "keywords": "Education, Bow,", "fb": {"app_id": 665237656918292}, "date": "2015-03-15 00:00:00", "twitter": {"description": "Residents approved a warrant article to implement full-day kindergarten at Bow Elementary School by a margin of 68 votes, despite the measure not having the endorsement of the school board or the budget committee.", "title": "Bow approves full-day kindergarten starting next year | New Hampshire", "url": "http://www.unionleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20150315/NEWS0612/150319340/-1/services01", "image": "/storyimage/UL/20150315/NEWS0612/150319340/AR/0/AR-150319340.jpg?q=70", "site": "@UnionLeader", "card": "summary$t"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9636\"", "article_summary": "(CASSIDY SWANSON/Union Leader Correspondent)Bow approves full-day kindergarten starting next yearResidents approved a warrant article to implement full-day kindergarten at Bow Elementary School by a margin of 68 votes, despite the measure not having the endorsement of the school board or the budget committee.\nIn 2014, the district charged a kindergarten committee with investigating the viability of full-day kindergarten and making a recommendation back to the board.\nResidents filled the auditorium of Bow High School on Friday night for the annual district meeting, where an article to approve full-day kindergarten starting next year was passed.\nMargaret Welch, who lives on Bow Center Road, said the town of Bow has \u201ctremendous decisions\u201d before it at this time, like the potential $5 million public safety complex, making full-day kindergarten a lower priority.\n(CASSIDY SWANSON/Union Leader Correspondent) Residents filled the auditorium of Bow High School on Friday night for the annual district meeting, where an article to approve full-day kindergarten starting next year was passed."}
