I'm on Medicare and I have no chronic illnesses so I bought a relatively cheap \"gap\" policy to cover the 20 percent of doctors bills that Medicare doesn't cover. I pay $40 a month and the first $2,700 or so in annual bills would be my problem.\n\nThe bottom line is that I'm not costing my insurer anything. In addition, the D.C. subsidiary alone is sitting on a nearly $1 billion cash surplus. So why did they raise my monthly rate to $54 starting April 1?\n\nThe first person who answered the phone said he didn't know why but told me everyone's rates were going up. After I complained via e-mail to Del. Shane Pendergrass, a Howard County Democrat and one of my representatives in the House of Delegates, I got a quick phone call from CareFirst.\n\nShe explained that 25 percent of the increase was due to my being a man who just turned 70 and the other 10 percent was a general rate increase. She said a few elderly people's premiums actually declined, but I told her my 65-year old wife got an increase too. When I pointed out that I'm not sick, have a high deductible and the Blues are swimming in \"non-profit cash,\" she said she isn't equipped to discuss actuarial theory with me. I thanked her for the information.\n\nOne day, the increasingly profitable insurance and drug industries are going to increase their rates to a point where even the Affordable Care Act won't save them from a single-payer health care system that actually makes sense.\n\nLarry Carson, Columbia", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "CareFirst's surprise birthday gift", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Baltimore Sun", "author": "Baltimore Sun", "og": {"site_name": "baltimoresun.com", "description": "I got an unexpected present after turning 70 in December \u2014 a 35 percent premium increase on my Medigap insurance from CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield.", "title": "CareFirst's surprise birthday gift", "url": "http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/bs-ed-premium-letter-20150208-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54d4f105/turbine/bs-ed-premium-letter-20150208", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp04.15", "twitter": {"site": "@baltimoresun", "card": "summary"}, "keywords": "CareFirst BlueCross Blue Shield Maryland Howard County rate increase Medicare Medigap", "robots": "index,follow", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=496681035, app-argument=http://www.baltimoresun.com/deeplinkid/82738035", "fb": {"page_id": 9299179711, "app_id": 310302989040998}, "googlebot-news": "index", "date": "2015-02-08", "Description": "My Medigap premium rose more than one-third last month but CareFirst can't explain why", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "CareFirst BlueCross Blue Shield Maryland Howard County rate increase Medicare Medigap"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaca9\"", "article_summary": "She explained that 25 percent of the increase was due to my being a man who just turned 70 and the other 10 percent was a general rate increase.\nI got an unexpected present after turning 70 in December \u2014 a 35 percent premium increase on my Medigap insurance from CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield.\nShe said a few elderly people's premiums actually declined, but I told her my 65-year old wife got an increase too.\nThe first person who answered the phone said he didn't know why but told me everyone's rates were going up.\nI'm on Medicare and I have no chronic illnesses so I bought a relatively cheap \"gap\" policy to cover the 20 percent of doctors bills that Medicare doesn't cover."}
