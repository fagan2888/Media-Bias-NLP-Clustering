But they don\u2019t agree on how to fix the issue. Several bills pending before Congress suggest very different approaches, and it\u2019s not clear yet which \u2014 if any \u2014 of the proposals will win out.\n\nTo understand the bills, start with the rule that inspired them.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act says employees who work more than 30 hours a week qualify as full time, and employers have to offer them insurance or risk fines of $2,000 to $3,000 per worker. The regulation applies to any company with more than 50 full-time-equivalent workers.\n\nObservers say the threshold is causing unintended consequences as employers drop workers below 30 hours to avoid the cost of coverage.\n\nThat could have big effects on the Las Vegas economy, with its high share of hourly service jobs in hospitality and restaurants, said Shaun O\u2019Brien, assistant policy director for health and retirement for big labor group AFL-CIO. And with average weekly hours worked coming in at 33.7 in August, according to local research firm Applied Analysis, plenty of Las Vegans hover close enough to the threshold to cross it.\n\n\u201cObamacare is supposed to be helping those who can\u2019t afford insurance, but it\u2019s actually hurting them by forcing their bosses to cut back on hours,\u201d said Randi Thompson, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business.\n\nAdded Yvanna Cancela, political director of the hospitality union Culinary Local 226, \u201cUnless fixes are made by the administration and Congress, hard-working Americans will be taking a giant step back rather than a big step forward when it comes to health care.\u201d\n\nNo one tracks local changes in full- versus part-time employment, but Cancela pointed to U.S. Chamber of Commerce studies showing that 31 percent of franchised small and midsized businesses have already cut hours more than a year before the employer mandate takes effect on Jan. 1, 2015. Another 27 percent said they\u2019ve replaced full-timers with part-timers. Among nonfranchised businesses, 12 percent have cut hours, and 12 percent have swapped out full-timers.\n\nMetro Pizza hasn\u2019t cut hours among the 240 employees at any of its six Las Vegas locations, and it doesn\u2019t want to, co-founder Sam Facchini said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve run a family like business for a third of a century in Las Vegas, and we understand that we cannot do it without our employees,\u201d Facchini said. \u201cFirst and foremost, it would be awfully hard to cut a full-time employee\u2019s hours down under 30 a week without really devastating that person\u2019s lifestyle. But you\u2019re also changing the business model we\u2019ve structured. We can\u2019t provide that pizza-dining experience without great employees who are happy to be there and who believe in what we believe in.\u201d\n\nStill, 75 percent of Metro\u2019s employees work fewer than 40 hours a week, and 90 percent work around that 30-hour mark. That means Metro\u2019s owners, like legions of other businesses, could have decisions to make as the employer mandate looms in 2014, Facchini said. Forget about merely cutting hours; Metro may have to raise prices, too.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of business survival in many cases, and our company would be no exception,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would need to be very mindful of how we make the math work so that we could pay our bills week to week and month to month. It\u2019s that way for almost any business. I think pushing that full-time threshold down to 30 hours actually destroys jobs, I really do.\u201d\n\nBut on how to patch the problem, businesses and labor unions differ dramatically.\n\nBills that would change the law have been before the House of Representatives since early 2013. The Forty Hours is Full Time Act would set the workweek at, well, 40 hours. And the Save American Workers Act would repeal the 30-hour threshold and also replace it with a 40-hour standard.\n\nReps. Mark Amodei, R-Nev., and Joe Heck, R-Nev., are co-sponsoring the Save American Workers Act.\n\nGovernment transparency group Civic Impulse doesn\u2019t give either bill good odds. The group\u2019s GovTrack website says the Forty Hours is Full Time Act has a 1 percent chance of passing the House, while Amodei\u2019s and Heck\u2019s bill has a 5 percent shot.\n\nThose poor prospects are a good thing, union leaders say. They\u2019re partial to a bill that would leave the 30-hour threshold in place and apply fines to a share of part-time workers. The Part-Time Worker Bill of Rights Act has no Nevada co-sponsors, and, according to GovTrack, no chance of enactment, either.\n\nIn a perfect world, O\u2019Brien said, the full employer penalty would kick in at 20 hours, and companies would pay a prorated fine on employees who work fewer than 20 hours. That\u2019s because if you move the penalty limit to 40 hours, companies would simply cut off employees at 39 hours a week.\n\n\u201cThat threshold is really a cliff,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cThe basic problem is that if you create an hours cliff, you put people at risk of having their hours reduced by an employer in order to avoid any responsibility for coverage and risk of paying a penalty.\u201d\n\nBut the AFL-CIO\u2019s suggestion simply isn\u2019t possible for most businesses, said Frank Nolimal, an employee benefits consultant with Las Vegas insurance brokerage Assurance Ltd.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not mathematically feasible for a company to employ people at union income levels and provide full benefits at 20 hours a week,\u201d Nolimal said. \u201cThe cost of health care per employee would skyrocket because premiums aren\u2019t going to change. Employers would just have to pay more.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s more, most labor laws already recognize a 40-hour week, Facchini said. Overtime rules are based on it, and corporate paperwork revolves around it.\n\n\u201cWe have a historical precedent to work with, and I see it as the logical threshold for any labor-related bill,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a real battle in Congress if we start looking at setting different levels of penalty. It sounds like the more explosive and onerous option. And it\u2019s much more of a record-keeping challenge, because we have people who fall just above or below 20 hours. Where do you draw the line? How often does someone have to work 19 hours before you pay a lower penalty, or 21 hours before you have a different penalty?\u201d\n\nEither way, both sides said they\u2019re confident lawmakers will eventually change the rule, one way or another. Lawmakers and President Barack Obama have already delayed the law\u2019s small-business health insurance exchanges, put the employer-coverage mandate on hold for a year and repealed a 1099 tax-form mandate and a long-term insurance program, among more than two dozen other tweaks.\n\n\u201cAll of the rollbacks in Obamacare so far are, to me, an indication that someone is at least willing to look at these things and say, \u2018This isn\u2019t working,\u2019\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt seems like, every time something gets implemented and doesn\u2019t work, they say, \u2018OK, let\u2019s fix that.\u2019 \u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Obamacare is a uniter, not a divider.
