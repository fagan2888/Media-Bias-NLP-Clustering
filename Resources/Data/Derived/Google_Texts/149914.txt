Antoine Pittman calls Fred Van Vleet a hometown hero.

Sunday he will call him the enemy.

Pittman, a freshman at Bradley, is excited to see fellow Rockford native Van Vleet on the floor. The Missouri Valley favorite Wichita State plays at Bradley Sunday afternoon.

Van Vleet is an All-American guard with the Shockers.

"I've seen him work, I've worked with him," said Pittman. "I've seen how hard he goes, how hungry he was and and how hungry he still is. Just for the peple around Rockford, he's setting the example for them and he set the example for me."

Tip off is set for 1 p.m. Sunday.
