Study author Talma Hendler of Tel Aviv University in Israel told New Scientist that she was particularly interested in \u201chow lack of sleep leaves us with a short emotional fuse.\u201d So she and her team kept 18 adults awake all night, which, as one would imagine, was no small feat.\n\nParticipants were given two rounds of tests while undergoing brain scans both during their all-nighter and the day after a good night\u2019s sleep. New Scientist reported that one of the tests asked participants to describe which direction yellow dots were moving, in which the dots were laid over distracting images. These images could be \u201cpositively emotional\u201d (cat photos), \u201cnegatively emotional\u201d (a mutilated body), or neutral (a spoon).\n\nResearchers found that when participants got a good night\u2019s sleep, they were quicker and better at telling the direction of movement when the dots were over a neutral image. Without sleep, however, participants performed equally bad when the dots were over neutral and emotional images. Hendler said it could be sleep deprivation \u201cuniversally impairs judgment,\u201d but it could also be \u201cthat lack of sleep makes neutral images suddenly provoke an emotional response.\u201d\n\nTo further their study, researchers conducted a second experiment that involved participants being shown neutral and emotional images while inside an fMRI scanner. This time, as participants completed a task, researchers could measure activity in different areas of the brain. And like the first experiment, researchers found that sleep deprived participants were distracted by every image whereas non-sleep deprived participants were only distracted by emotional images.\n\nIn the brain, the amygdala \u2014 a region associated with emotion \u2014 was activated when non-sleep deprived participants were seeing emotional images. Among those who were sleep deprived, the amygdala fired up in response to neutral and emotional images. What\u2019s more is researchers found unusual activity in the anterior cingulate cortex, a brain region believed to regulate the amygdala.\n\nThese parts of the brain usually \u201cfire together,\u201d New Scientist reported; without adequate rest, these brain regions fire out of sync. As a result, Hendler said it\u2019s harder to control our emotional responses.\n\n\u201cYou lose neutrality,\u201d Hendler added. \u201cThe ability of the brain to tell what\u2019s important is compromised \u2014 it\u2019s as if everything is important.\u201d\n\nThe solution, of course, is obvious: try to get some sleep. Medical Daily has previously reported on some sleep hacks, here, here, and here. If not for better control of emotions then for the fact that sufficient sleep can help you avoid a host of health problems.\n\nSource: Hendler T, et al.
