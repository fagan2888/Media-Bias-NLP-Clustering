Marco Rubio might be a Spanish-speaking Cuban from Miami, but he is currently winning the Republican Party\u2019s \u201cAmerican\u201d presidential primary as the only guy speaking common English right now.\n\nIt is still early in a wide-open contest for the nomination, and there are plenty of other important hurdles each candidate must clear. But, as Republicans have learned in the last few disappointing presidential elections, nothing is more important than having a candidate who can speak like a normal American.\n\nIn 2008, we learned that Sen. John McCain\u2019s crazy Geritol/Beach Boys talk about \u201cbomb, bomb, bomb \u2014 bomb, bomb Iran\u201d and suspending his fizzling presidential campaign to somehow stop the economic meltdown was no match for all the gilded hype about \u201chope\u201d and \u201cchange.\u201d We now know that then-Sen. Barack Obama was totally full of untreated sewage, but at least he served it to us in ordinary English.\n\nFour years later, Mitt Romney of the loftier regions of the upper 52 percent, taught us that speaking rich guy and talking about how he loves firing people isn\u2019t a terribly good strategy for reaching the presidency. The high point of Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign was the first debate, where President Obama talked like exasperated royalty and Mr. Romney stunned the world with his command of plain English.\n\nThe ensuing November beat down of the GOP \u2014 despite the shambles Mr. Obama and Democrats were making of the place \u2014 was so stinging that even the famously obtuse party bosses got the message. After a period of intense introspection, they concluded: \u201cThe Republican Party needs to stop talking to itself.\u201d\n\nFormer Gov. Jeb Bush speaks pure blue-blood Brahmin. And no matter how much salsa cred he claims by constantly pimping out his little wife, he remains a very pale patrician.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz beautifully encapsulates the rage most voters feel toward Washington. But unfortunately he speaks right-wing Kool-Aid that, literally, frightens little children in the audience. That is not good. Politicians are supposed to kiss little babies, not scare them.\n\nSen. Rand Paul seems to have perfectly captured the don\u2019t-tread-on-me sentiments of many conservatives, particularly the young. Problem is that he also seems to be speaking kook. His father got away with it because he was an appealing old man. But with Rand, it is like he is tuned to a frequency that can only be picked up if you are wearing a tinfoil hat.\n\nFormer Gov. Mike Huckabee comes very, very close to speaking plain American and can be genuinely hysterical, especially when he is mocking other candidates. But he can\u2019t help himself veering wildly into preacher mode, which is deadly for a politician.\n\nScott Walker and Bobby Jindal are both \u2014 God bless them! \u2014 governors and not politicians long steeped in the putrid excreta of Washington, D.C. But when they open their mouths, they both speak geek.\n\nAll their policy positions, spending cuts and taking on the beastly public unions are beyond commendable. But to be a viable presidential contender, you have to speak ordinary American English.\n\nMr. Rubio has had his stumbles, and his present position in the U.S. Senate should certainly be held against him. But when he speaks \u2014 in Spanish or English \u2014 he speaks American. He tells a story. He talks about legal immigration that unites people. He talks vividly about the American dream. And he does it with humility and optimism and without scaring little children.\n\nThe good news for Republicans is that Democrats appear \u2014 once again \u2014 to be ready to canonize Hillary Rodham Clinton as their nominee. She hasn\u2019t spoken a word of English in the quarter-century since she left Arkansas.\n\n\u2022 Charles Hurt can be reached at charleshurt@live.com, and on Twitter at @charleshurt.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Sen.
