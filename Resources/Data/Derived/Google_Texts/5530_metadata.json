Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nGood Tuesday Morning, and Happy Veterans\u2019 Day, a holiday that began in 1938 to honor those who served in World War I - the so-called War to End All Wars - and now has expanded to pay respect to all those who donned an American military uniform (click here for a quick video tutorial). Here\u2019s today\u2019s Three Minute Briefing Book, all you need to know in 180\u200b seconds or your next one\u2019s free:\n\nVet\u2019s Day Tribute: Vice President Joe Biden delivered remarks at the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery today. The unofficial Veterans\u2019 Day centerpiece, however, comes this evening with HBO\u2019s much-publicized Concert for Valor on the National Mall, a free show with big-name acts like Bruce Springsteen and Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters saluting the military.\n\n[READ: The Biggest Problem Veterans Still Face]\n\nAsia Trip Continues: Meanwhile, Biden\u2019s boss, President Barack Obama, continues to blend trade and diplomacy at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Beijing today. In addition to trade talks with China and Asian nations, the president met briefly with Russian President Vladimir Putin and will have sideline meetings on how to further deter both Iran and North Korea from obtaining nuclear weapons.\n\nSetting the Standard: Obama\u2019s pro-net neutrality statement yesterday, urging the Federal Communications Commission to regulate the Internet like a public utility, is causing ripples not only here but across the pond. The Guardian has a story declaring the president\u2019s statement would influence governments and cable providers around the world.\n\nCollision Course: Back on Capitol Hill, the big talk these days is around immigration: newly-empowered Senate Republicans are parsing Obama\u2019s promise to use executive action to not only slow deportations but allow some undocumented migrants to stay in the country and forge a path to citizenship. Bloomberg\u2019s Dave Wiegel has a pretty good take here. The GOP has a counter-strategy, though: use the issue to beat down Loretta Lynch, a pro-reform Brooklyn fededral prosecutor and the president\u2019s pick to replace outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nVoters sidelined by laws?: A week after the Great Elephant Stampede that was the 2014 midterm elections, the parsing continues: the Brennan Center for Justice reports that new voter ID laws in several states may have influenced the outcome in elections: in some places, the percentage of voters who didn\u2019t have access to the polls came close to the winner\u2019s margin of victory.\n\n[ALSO: U.S., China Reach Trade Deal in Beijing]\n\nEbo-what? The U.S., gripped by fear after four confirmed cases of Ebola made front-page headlines, is now officially Ebola-free. A New York doctor - the last of those known cases - was released from the hospital, effectively cured of the deadly virus.\n\nReady For Her Close-Up: Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, consumer advocate and liberals\u2019 dream president, took her progressive economic message to Hollywood last night, accepting an award from the American Civil Liberties Union. She told the audience that \u201cthe game is rigged\u201d against ordinary Americans because Wall Street has Congress in its thrall.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Washington Whispers [News]", "title": "Three-Minute Briefing Book: Veteran's Day Edition", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "Biden honors vets while Obama's in Beijing; Sen.
