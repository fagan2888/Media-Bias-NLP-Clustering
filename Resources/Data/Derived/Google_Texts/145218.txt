Coffeyville voters overwhelmingly passed a half-cent sales tax for their local hospital during Tuesday’s citywide vote. The final count was 998 in favor, 131 against.

Tuesday’s vote will replace the existing sale tax with new tax revenue that will be used to improve emergency services and EMS programs at Coffeyville Regional Medical Center. The hospital spends nearly 2 million dollars a year providing Board Certified/Eligible Emergency Medical physicians in the ER. CRMC also provided nearly $1.5 million dollars in charity care in 2015. The impact of the passing of the Affordable Care Act has resulted in over $1 million dollars in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements over the past year.

Voters first approved the sales tax to benefit the hospital in 2001. The funds raised since then helped CRMC with the construction and renovation cost of a new cancer treatment center and with other patient related projects. The CRMC Board of Trustees was able pay off the bonds early and the current half-cent sales tax will expire this summer.

Coffeyville Regional Medical Center is a city owned not-for-profit facility that is totally self-sufficient. The hospital generates funds through patient care billing, grants and the current sale tax revenues. The CRMC Auxiliary is a volunteer group that provides some patient services and they also conduct fundraising activities for equipment replacement and other special projects.
