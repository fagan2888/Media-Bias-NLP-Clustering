GOODYEAR, Ariz. — Tyler Matzek, the Rockies’ left-hander still battling mental demons affecting his command, was scratched from a scheduled “B” game start Sunday.

Matzek on Wednesday gave up three runs without an out in a Cactus League game against Arizona. He walked two consecutive batters, then allowed a home run that cleared the bases.

His performance anxiety, diagnosed by the Rockies last year, remains an issue. So pitching coach Steve Foster and Weiss decided to pull him from what was supposed to be a build-up, rebound appearance in an unofficial game on a side field at Salt River Fields.

“We’re going to attack it. We’ll put together a plan and work on some things,” Weiss said. “Just go to work and try to fight through.”

Weiss said they’re still trying to find his best path, as a starter or a reliever.

Raburn hits 2-for-2. New Rockies outfielder Ryan Raburn went 2-for-4 with a run scored in the “B” game against Arizona. Pitching prospect Antonio Senzatela was the game’s standout. He threw three innings, with four strikeouts and four groundouts, while allowing two hits.
