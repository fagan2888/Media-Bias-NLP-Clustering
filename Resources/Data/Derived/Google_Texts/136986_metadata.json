Thomas has two seasons of eligibility remaining. ( Jeremy Papasso / Staff Photographer )\n\nFormer Colorado basketball player Dustin Thomas announced Sunday on Twitter that he is transferring to Arkansas.\n\n\"Proud to announce that I'll be joining the Arkansas Razorbacks for the remainder of my college career! #GrindMode #Hogs,\" Thomas tweeted.\n\nThomas reportedly made an official visit to Arkansas this past weekend. Arkansas has yet to announce that Thomas is joining the team.\n\nLast month, Thomas made the decision to leave CU after two seasons. The 6-foot-7 forward from Texarkana, Texas, appeared in 67 games over the past two seasons at CU, with 17 starts, averaging 4.0 points and 2.5 rebounds.\n\nThomas showed slight improvement as a sophomore, posting 4.4 points and 2.5 rebounds per game. He made 11 starts, most of those when junior Josh Scott was out with a back injury.\n\nThomas' field-goal, 3-point and free throw shooting percentages all improved this past year. He also made a dramatic improvement in his assist-to-turnover ratio, going from 0.39 assists per turnover as a freshman to 0.85 as a sophomore.\n\nWhen CU announced Thomas' departure in March, head coach Tad Boyle said he believed the main reason was for more playing time and a position change.\n\n\"I think he wants to play a little bit more on the perimeter than we were willing to play him,\" Boyle said.\n\nBoyle added: \"He doesn't leave here with any ill will towards us, and we certainly have no ill will towards him. He feels like he's better suited to move on and we support him in that decision.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's likely that Thomas will sit out the 2015-16 season per the NCAA transfer rule and then have two seasons of eligibility remaining. He should have a great opportunity to play in 2016-17, though.\n\nArkansas (27-9 this past season) lost four players off this past season's team and is slated to lose four seniors in 2016.\n\nThomas also reportedly visited Wyoming and Central Michigan.\n\nContact staff writer Brian Howell at howellb@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/BrianHowell33.", "article_metadata": {"startDate": "2015-05-03T17:07:10-0600", "sailthru.author": "By Brian Howell \n \n  BuffZone.com", "ag": {"canon": "BoulderDailyCamera:article:28041186:view"}, "twitter": {"domain": "dailycamera.com", "description": "Former Colorado basketball player Dustin Thomas announced Sunday on Twitter that he is transferring to Arkansas.", "title": "CU men's basketball: Ex-Buff Dustin Thomas transferring to Arkansas", "image": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0503/20150503__04DCSMBUw~1.jpg", "site": "@dailycamera", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.article-section-or-homepage": "article", "modificationDate": "2015-05-03T19:24:42-0600", "endDate": "2025-05-03T17:05:06-0600", "news_keywords": "Buffzone, cu, college sports, university of colorado, boulder, colorado", "byline": "By Brian HowellBuffZone.com", "pubDate": "2015-05-03T17:08:44-0600", "sailthru.date": "2015-05-03T17:07:10-0600", "sailthru.title": "CU men's basketball: Ex-Buff Dustin Thomas transferring to Arkansas", "verify-v1": "TakAiHiDAOiNOP+m0YTx4DQeyjor+bTdc8e+pw6bDoI=", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0503/20150503__04DCSMBUw~1_300.jpg", "description": "Former Colorado basketball player Dustin Thomas announced Sunday on Twitter that he is transferring to Arkansas.", "sailthru.site": "dailycamera.com", "msvalidate.01": "9DAB14005AD5A9FFA4CA0EF58CC794BA", "og": {"image": "http://extras.dailycamera.com/images/dailycamera3.png", "type": "article", "description": "Former Colorado basketball player Dustin Thomas announced Sunday on Twitter that he is transferring to Arkansas.", "title": "CU men's basketball: Ex-Buff Dustin Thomas transferring to Arkansas"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "867892b0357001538903740c75a206f0"}, "google-site-verification": "07CC1xPDVU0znu496XTAjLyC32Ylj8zwWHlmrzx3pgY", "y_key": "c9d9b53f7f5af674", "sailthru.image.full": "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site21/2015/0503/20150503__04DCSMBUw~1.jpg"}, "article_summary": "( Jeremy Papasso / Staff Photographer )Former Colorado basketball player Dustin Thomas announced Sunday on Twitter that he is transferring to Arkansas.\nWhen CU announced Thomas' departure in March, head coach Tad Boyle said he believed the main reason was for more playing time and a position change.\nForward played in 67 games for CU the last two seasonsFormer Colorado forward Dustin Thomas, left, announced Sunday on Twitter that he is transferring to Arkansas.\nArkansas (27-9 this past season) lost four players off this past season's team and is slated to lose four seniors in 2016.\nThomas reportedly made an official visit to Arkansas this past weekend."}
