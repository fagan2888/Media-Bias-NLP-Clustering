When I\u2019m in a funk, I love being taken away by Walt Simonson\u2019s version of Norse mythology, Matt Faction and Howard Chaykin\u2019s black-and-white look at fifties TV, or Skottie Young\u2019s exuberant new series starring movie star Rocket Raccoon.\n\nBut sometimes comics take on a real-life villain and do it well. I\u2019m talking about cancer.\n\nMy dad was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer, so the c-word is on my mind. Thankfully, they caught it early, so his prognosis is excellent, but it got me thinking about how well comic books \u2014 particularly Marvel, for some reason \u2014 have dealt with this horrible disease. Here\u2019s a look at some of the comic book characters who have battled a villain scarier than the Joker, Dr. Doom and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants combined.\n\nJane Foster\n\nPlayed by Natalie Portman in the \u201cThor\u201d movies, Jane Foster has been a love interest for Thor since she was introduced back in 1962. Back then, Thor had a mortal form he turned into when he slammed his hammer onto the ground: Dr. Donald Blake, who fell for Nurse Jane Foster. The romance led to drama, since daddy Odin was not cool with his son dating a Midgardian. I guess old gods tend to be as racist as old people. Anyway, Foster later becomes a doctor herself, and during the current run on Thor by Jason Aaron, she reveals to Thor (still a close friend) that she has breast cancer, and she\u2019s currently undergoing treatment. Her courage and Thor\u2019s powerlessness have been damn poignant. Foster recently joined the Council of Worlds as Earth\u2019s representative: the Council is kind of the UN for the nine worlds of Norse mythology. I\u2019m not sure where that storyline is leading, but I can\u2019t imagine a better representative of our planet.\n\nCaptain Marvel\n\nThe original Captain Marvel (well before the current Carol Danvers) was a Kree warrior named Mar-Vell, and he died of cancer in the aptly titled graphic novel \u201cThe Death of Captain Marvel.\u201d This is one of comics legend Jim Starlin\u2019s greatest works, showing that a writer/artist known for his cosmic stories is just as good at telling the most human story of all. Throughout the comic, Marvel\u2019s greatest heroes search for a cure unsuccessfully, as close friends of Mar-Vell such as Rick Jones deal with the grief and try to help their friend cope.\n\nSuperman\n\nIn possibly the greatest Superman story ever \u2014 Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely\u2019s \u201cAll-Star Superman\u201d \u2014 Lex Luthor uses Superman\u2019s alien cells against him by forcing him to absorb too much solar radiation, which gives Superman cancer. This elseworlds story shows Superman trying to do the most good he can, for everyone from Lois Lane to the bottle city of Kandor, before his death. Despite cancer, this story is tremendously fun and uplifting, as Morrison and Quitely celebrate everything great about Superman, including the kindness of the Kents, the loyalty of Krypto, the arrogance of Luthor and the absurdity of the Bizarro World. I won\u2019t spoil the outcome of the story, but there\u2019s no cop-out to be found.\n\nMary Jane Watson\n\nMost comic book portrayals of cancer are realistic and powerful. But not all. Sometimes the absurdity of comics infects a subject that deserves serious treatment, like in \u201cSpider-Man: Reign,\u201d a tale of a future Spider-Man that tried to be \u201cThe Dark Knight Returns\u201d of Marvel. When an older Peter Parker holds Mary Jane Watson\u2019s lifeless body, he exposits, \u201cThe doctors didn\u2019t understand how it happened! How you had been poisoned with radioactivity! How your body slowly became riddled with cancer! I do. I was\u2026 I am filled with radioactive blood. And not just blood. Every fluid.\u201d Yikes. Peter Parker killed Mary Jane with radioactive semen.
