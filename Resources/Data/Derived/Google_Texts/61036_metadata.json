Trey Gowdy.\n\nAttorneys representing the plaintiff, Air Force Reserve Maj. Bradley Podliska, claimed in federal court Monday that their client was wrongfully terminated from his job investigating the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nMr. Gowdy, South Carolina Republican and chairman of the committee, stated publicly last month that Maj. Podliska had been fired from the panel because of \u201cdeficient performance\u201d and allegations he had \u201cmishandle[d] classified information.\u201d\n\nAttorneys for Maj. Podliska claim he was terminated not because of any wrongdoing, but rather his decision to briefly abandon the investigation and serve 39 days with the Air Force Reserves \u2014 a maneuver allowed by law under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA).\n\n\u201cIn June 2015, Podliska was unlawfully fired by the Benghazi Committee because he sought to exercise his rights under USERRA. This followed months of increasing hostility towards Podliska because he left work to fulfill his military obligations as a reservist,\u201d his attorneys wrote in the complaint.\n\n\u201cChairman Gowdy and his Benghazi Committee staffers responded by intentionally defaming Podliska, making numerous false allegations to multiple national news outlet,\u201d the complaint continued.\n\nAdditionally, his lawyers claim that termination was sought because the reservist \u201cwas unwilling to along with the hyper-focus\u201d on the State Department and former Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton after returning from service.\n\nHouse Republicans said Maj. Podliska was fired for attempting to spearhead a campaign against the former secretary of state \u201cthat bore no relationship whatsoever to the committee\u2019s current investigative tone, focus or investigative plan\u201d with that of the panel.\n\nThe reservist\u2019s attorneys said the allegations were made \u201cwith reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the statements, and/or with negligence for the truth or falsity of the statement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe false and defamatory statements were published and broadcast by hundreds of different media outlets and were read and heard by millions of people, and Chairman Gowdy intended for them to be so disseminated,\u201d the lawsuit charged.\n\nThe plaintiff accuses the congressman of having intentionally set out to \u201cto damage Podliska\u2019s reputation and his ability to seek or secure employment in his chosen field, depriving Podliska of his rights under the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nJamal Ware, a communications director for the Benghazi panel, said the suit is \u201cmeritless\u201d and \u201cimproperly strike at the heart of the committee\u2019s legislative functions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe committee did not and does not discriminate or retaliate based on military service, military status or any other unlawful factor,\u201d Mr. Ware told The Washington Times Monday. \u201cWe look forward to responding to the allegations in due course and in the appropriate forum. And we are confident that once all the facts are known \u2014 should this case be permitted to proceed \u2014 we will be fully exonerated.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "An investigator who served on the House Select Committee on Benghazi before being fired earlier this year has filed a discrimination suit against the panel and its chairman, Rep.
