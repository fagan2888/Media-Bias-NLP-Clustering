A program started in 2011 by the Cherokee Nation to ensure more Cherokees attain college degrees graduated its first student at Northeastern State University on Saturday, May 10.

Bethany Glenn, of Stilwell, Oklahoma, is the first student to ever complete the Cherokee Promise Scholarship program. Glenn, a Cherokee citizen, will graduate from NSU with a bachelor’s degree in psychology.

Glenn was one of two sophomores to originally start the scholarship program. Scholars are awarded $4,600 a semester for college tuition, housing and meal plans. They live in a section of the dorm dedicated just for Cherokee students. It allows the students to better interact with and support each other.

“It has really been a privilege to be a part of such a fantastic scholarship program that provides financial support and a family-like support system,” Glenn said. “Living on campus and being so close to class and other resources has been so helpful, and I wouldn’t have had that luxury without the support of the Cherokee Nation.”

NSU currently has 45 Cherokee Promise Scholars. Because of its success, Rogers State University started a Cherokee Promise Scholars program on the Claremore campus in 2013 and currently has seven scholars.
