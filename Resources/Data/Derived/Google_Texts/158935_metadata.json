Gastroenterology 2015\n\nScientists at the National Institute of Health (NIH) have discovered a key genetic link for a rare intestinal cancer known as small intestinal carcinoid. Genes account for up to 35 percent of these cases, the researchers suggest in their report.\n\nThe results are significant, because detecting this rare cancer is often difficult and occurs too late. Genes passed down through relatives weren\u2019t previously associated with the cancer until now, so people with a family history of small intestinal carcinoid weren\u2019t typically screened.\n\n\u201cSmall intestinal carcinoid tumors usually grow slowly without symptoms,\u201d Dr. Stephen Wank, senior investigator at the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), an author of the study, said in the press release. \u201cIt is often too late to reverse the condition once people seek medical attention.\u201d\n\nThe authors state that moving forward, people who have a family history of small intestinal carcinoid should take precautions and get themselves checked out. The researchers identified one particular gene defect that is passed down from one generation to the next that is likely linked to the disease.\n\nThey screened 181 people from 33 families \u2014 each of whom had at least two cases of the disease. Among the participants, 23 people had the disease that hadn\u2019t been previously detected and hadn\u2019t developed symptoms yet. Because they were screened early (based on their family history), doctors were able to remove tumors in 21 of them.\n\n\u201cThis innovative study embodies NIH\u2019s unmatched leadership in rare disease research,\u201d NIDDK Director Dr. Griffin Rodgers said in the press release. \u201cOur new understanding of small intestinal carcinoid tumors gives scientists and health care providers a stronger platform to continue to develop proactive approaches in treatment, diagnosis and prevention.\u201d\n\nIf people have a family history of small intestinal carcinoid tumors, they\u2019re invited to join the NIH study by visiting this site. Even though there\u2019s only about 30,000 Americans with the cancer, the researchers hope their results will spur others to get screened sooner versus later.\n\n\u201cOur findings suggest that people with a family history of the disease should be screened for it,\u201d Wank continued. \u201cWe hope this research empowers thousands of at-risk people with a way to prevent these tumors from becoming a devastating disease.\u201d\n\nSource: Sei Y, Zhao X, Forbes J, Szymczak S, Li Q, Trivedi A. \u201cA Hereditary Form of Small Intestinal Carcinoid Associated with a Germline Mutation in Inositol Polyphosphate Multikinase.\u201d Gastroenterology, 2015.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "intestinal cancer, small intestinal carcinoid, cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "People who have a family history of small intestinal carcinoid should be screened for the disease, researchers state.", "title": "Scientists Discover Genetic Link For Rare Intestinal Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/scientists-discover-genetic-link-rare-intestinal-cancer-often-found-too-late-be-329628", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/16/small-intestinal-carcinoid.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "People who have a family history of small intestinal carcinoid should be screened for the disease, researchers state.", "title": "Scientists Discover Genetic Link For Rare Intestinal Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/scientists-discover-genetic-link-rare-intestinal-cancer-often-found-too-late-be-329628", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/16/small-intestinal-carcinoid.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/04/16/small-intestinal-carcinoid.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Innovation", "published_time": "2015-04-16T16:57:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-16T17:30:54-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "People who have a family history of small intestinal carcinoid should be screened for the disease, researchers state."}, "article_summary": "Gastroenterology 2015Scientists at the National Institute of Health (NIH) have discovered a key genetic link for a rare intestinal cancer known as small intestinal carcinoid.\n\u201cA Hereditary Form of Small Intestinal Carcinoid Associated with a Germline Mutation in Inositol Polyphosphate Multikinase.\u201d Gastroenterology, 2015.\nGenes passed down through relatives weren\u2019t previously associated with the cancer until now, so people with a family history of small intestinal carcinoid weren\u2019t typically screened.\nShown is a section of the small intestine, with the wide distribution of multiple carcinoid tumors identified by sutures.\nBecause they were screened early (based on their family history), doctors were able to remove tumors in 21 of them."}
