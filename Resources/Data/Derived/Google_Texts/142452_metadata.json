The last day to enroll through healthcare.gov is Jan. 31.\n\nYour health insurance is about to change the look of your workplace. It comes as more and more employers are asking questions that once seemed private or off limits.\n\nNew health insurance laws may change the look of your workplace in 2016\n\nThe deadline for Covered California's open enrollment wraps on Jan. 31. For Californians who do not have health insurance, they could face a tax penalty that starts at $700. Covered California executive director Peter Lee was in the studio to answer questions people may have about their health care options.\n\nHundreds of Californians will pay a hefty tax penalty in 2016 for not having health insurance last year, but in some cases, the penalty is often less than what they would have paid for a health plan.\n\nDec. 15 is the last day to sign up for health insurance through the healthcare.gov marketplace for coverage by January 1, 2016.\n\nSome Americans decided to go without Obamacare \u2014 or any insurance plan \u2014 in 2014, despite the threat of a tax penalty. We reached out to hear their stories.\n\nWhen the federal health insurance marketplace officially debuted this time last year, Marta Hardy, 60, felt just one emotion: relief.\n\nAt the time, Hardy, who lives in Lakeland, Ga., had gone nearly four years without insurance. She had a decent-paying job working full-time at a small manufacturing plant, but the company didn\u2019t offer health plans. Her husband was already retired and could take advantage of Medicare. That left Hardy, who was recently diagnosed with thyroid disease and takes medication for high blood pressure, entering her 60s with no safety net.\n\n\u201cI was excited to finally have an opportunity to have insurance,\u201d she says. \u201cThen I checked [the marketplace] and I found that the lowest tier Bronze plan was going to run me $725 per month, plus a $6,300 annual deductible. That is a house payment or two car payments for me.\u201d\n\nHardy decided not to sign up. Come tax time, she, like most people who decided to forgo insurance in 2014, will have to pay for that decision. The penalty this year is 1% of gross annual income or $95 per adult (whichever is greater), plus $47.50 per child. There are a few exemptions to this rule, including people who earn too little to file federal taxes (less than $20,000 for families and less than $10,000 for individuals) and people who spend more than 8% of their income on health insurance.\n\nBut for Hardy, deciding between a penalty or health coverage was a simple matter of math. Signing up for a plan would have been much costlier than taking the penalty and continuing to pay out of pocket.\n\n\u201cI go to the doctor several times every year and still does not add up to what my insurance premium would have been under Obamacare,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m glad there\u2019s something out there for people who can\u2019t get insured, but there are people who are working and paying their bills and trying to follow the rules and it\u2019s not even within our reach.\u201d\n\nThe \u2018opt-out\u2019 nation\n\nMore than 8 million Americans purchased new health plans in 2014, but there are still an estimated 41 million American adults left uninsured in the U.S., according to the CDC\n\n\n\nFor some consumers like Hardy, it\u2019s not for lack of desire. More than 30% of uninsured Americans said cost was the biggest barrier for purchasing coverage, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey published last year. Another 30% blamed their lack of coverage on job loss. Only 1.5% said they didn\u2019t have coverage because they didn\u2019t need it.\n\nFederal tax subsidies can dull the sting of an otherwise expensive plan. Per Kaiser, 17 million Americans who were either uninsured or purchased health insurance on their own were eligible for subsidies this year\n\n\n\nMarsha Danley, 56, was among those who earned too much to qualify for a subsidy. It\u2019s been more than a decade since Danley last had a insurance. After losing her job at a tech company during the dot-com crash, she worked for a string of small employers that didn\u2019t offer benefits.\n\nThe Napa, Calif., accountant earns $68,000 a year (well above the $45,000 individual income threshold to qualify for tax subsidies) and was quoted $500 a month for a benchmark Silver plan, which came with a $5,000 annual deductible.\n\nIf she were debt-free, the $500 monthly premium might be manageable. But when her mother became ill a few years ago, her home healthcare bills fell into Danley\u2019s lap, leaving her with nearly $20,000 worth of debt to manage on her own.\n\n\u201cTaking a hit on my tax refund is a lot cheaper than paying $6,000 a year for a plan and another $5,000 for a deductible,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s a total waste of money for me. That can be better put to paying off my debt.\u201d\n\nDanley, who does her own taxes, is preparing to factor in the 1% penalty already.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s great that they make it where everybody can get insurance, but to say that if you don\u2019t get it I\u2019m going to tax you, that\u2019s not right,\u201d she says.\n\nWhat to expect at tax time\n\nSo what happens if you didn\u2019t have health insurance this year? When tax season rolls around next year, be prepared to face a penalty. Once you know what your final income will be for 2014, you should be able to calculate the penalty amount on your own. But people who have more complicated tax situations might want to sit down with a tax pro soon to figure out what they\u2019re up against.\n\n\n\nView photo . Marta Hardy, 61, decided to forgo Obamacare coverage. exemption from the penalty, you\u2019ll have to fill out Form 8965 when you file taxes. Check out a preview of what that form will look like here, but the final version of the form hasn\u2019t yet been issued by the IRS, says Kristin Esposito, a CPA and a tax staff member with the American Institute of CPAs.\n\nOverall, the process should be simple to complete. But considering the glitches that plagued the marketplace\u2019s rollout last year, it might be best to handle your taxes a bit earlier than usual in 2015.\n\n\u201cWhenever there\u2019s something new like this, there are going to be some bumps in the road,\u201d Esposito says.\n\nMonths before tax-filing season, consumers without insurance now will again have to decide whether to sign up for coverage next year. Open enrollment period for the federal marketplace and state-run exchanges begins Nov. 15.\n\nThe threat of a 1% tax penalty may not have been enough to push people over the fence this time around, but the penalties will only increase \u2013 up to 2% of income or $325 per adult in 2015, and 2.5% of income or $695 per adult in 2016.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the cost of the benchmark silver plan is predicted to drop by 0.8% next year, which might make it harder for some to argue against signing up.\n\n\u201cFolks need to reevaluate very shortly if they want coverage for 2015, because even if they didn\u2019t owe a penalty for 2014, that doesn\u2019t mean they wouldn\u2019t owe one for 2015 and the penalty could be much steeper,\u201d Esposito says.\n\nAre you planning to change your Obamacare plan or sign up for the first time this year?
