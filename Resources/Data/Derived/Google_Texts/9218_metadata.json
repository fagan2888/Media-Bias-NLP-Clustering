CC BY 2.0\n\nNew research shows that gaining weight during your midlife \u2014 between ages 40 and 60 \u2014 can increase your risk of getting Alzheimer\u2019s earlier. The study, published in Molecular Psychiatry, was conducted by researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nObesity has been linked to cognitive impairment and Alzheimer\u2019s in past studies; researchers have found that obesity increases certain brain proteins, which play a role in developing dementia. In addition, past research has shown that obese people actually have less brain tissue than healthy weight people \u2014 their brains shrinking as they get fatter.\n\n\u201cThe brains of obese people looked 16 years older than their healthy counterparts while [those of] overweight people looked 8 years older,\u201d Paul Thompson, a neuroscientist at UCLA and an author of the study, said. In other words, obesity accelerates aging much in the same way that smoking, drinking heavily, or living sedentarily do.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that obesity is linked to Alzheimer\u2019s. But the new study wanted to examine how midlife weight gain in particular could play a role in early development of the disease. They found that being overweight or obese at age 50 could influence the age that one developed Alzheimer\u2019s later on \u2014 and it usually meant it would happen earlier.\n\nThey examined the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, a survey that tracks people as they age. The researchers checked some 1,400 participants who had received cognitive tests every year for 14 years \u2014 and also tracked their BMI and weight throughout the years. Out of the total, 142 had developed Alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 and their BMI predicted how soon dementia would strike. For example, someone with a BMI of 30 at age 50 (which is considered obese, as any BMI over 25 is overweight) could see Alzheimer\u2019s occur a year sooner than someone with a BMI of 28.\n\n\u201cMaintaining a healthy BMI at midlife is likely to have long-lasting protective effects,\u201d Dr. Madhev Thambisetty, an author of the study and a researcher at the NIH\u2019s National Institute on Aging, said, according to the AP. However, the researchers aren\u2019t sure whether staying fit throughout your middle ages will necessarily protect you from Alzheimer\u2019s. More research will be needed in order to solidify this link.\n\nUntil then, it\u2019s good to stay on the safer side and take care of yourself \u2013 starting sooner versus later. Exercising and eating a good diet has been shown to boost cognitive function and protect your brain, heart, as well as many other aspects of your body. Obesity increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and mental health problems like depression and anxiety, all of which can play off one another and contribute to other chronic diseases.\n\nSource: Chuang Y, An Y, Bilgel M, Wong D, Troncoso J, O\u2019Brien R.
