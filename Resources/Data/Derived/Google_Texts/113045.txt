HARRISON — A PATH train struck a box truck in Harrison and partially derailed tonight, officials said, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of passengers on board.

Erica Dumas, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, said the train was heading into Newark when it struck the truck around 9 p.m. She said two wheels of the train derailed off the track.

She said four people — the truck driver, the train conductor, one engineer and one passenger — suffered minor injuries and were being transported to Saint Michael's Medical Center in Newark for treatment.

She said more than 200 passengers were evacuated from the train.

She said Port Authority police, as well as Harrison police and fire officials, were on scene and the incident is still under investigation.
