It\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done and what I\u2019ve always wanted to get back to.\u201d\n\nAfter seven collegiate stops, including Texas A&M, Wyoming and Houston, Barone broke into the NFL as an assistant line coach under zone-blocking guru Alex Gibbs with Atlanta in 2004. From 2005-09, Barone coached tight ends for the Falcons and Chargers and, ultimately, for the Broncos in the first year of McDaniels\u2019 tenure.\n\nIn McDaniels\u2019 bizarre second season, which included his early December firing, Barone had his first chance as an NFL head offensive line coach, getting the most out of rookies J.D. Walton and Zane Beadles as starters.\n\nBut Barone was back to handling the tight ends during the Fox regime.\n\n\u201cI still got to work a lot in the run game,\u201d Barone said. \u201cI got to work a lot in protections. The coordinator I worked with always trusted me to do that, along with coaching the tight ends and work with the passing game stuff. It was a challenge to learn a new part of the offense. I enjoyed it and I got to work with some great players. But it was always kind of my career goal to get back home.\u201d\n\n\u201cHome\u201d means, among other places, the offensive line meeting room. In the NFL, it\u2019s typically a workplace of dry and barbed humor and perhaps even more \u201cin it together\u201d camaraderie than anywhere else in the building.\n\nBarone and Eric Studesville are the only Denver assistants to remain through the past two head coaching changes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always that anxious time where you\u2019re thinking, \u2018Do we have to move?\u2019 \u201d Barone said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve known Gary for a long time, and we worked together at Texas A&M (in 1993), and I think that was Gary\u2019s first coaching job. I knew I would love to stay and I\u2019m fortunate that it all worked out for me and Rosie, my wife.\u201d\n\nBarone also is centrally involved in the return to the zone-blocking scheme.\n\n\u201cThere is that learning curve about how you adjust it, why you adjust it, when do you adjust it \u2014 all those types of things,\u201d Barone said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably part of the fun of it, to teach them the overall big picture.\u201d\n\nAlthough the Broncos have shuffled their No. 1 offensive line during the first three days of camp, most noticeably giving veteran Ryan Harris looks at right tackle, one of the constants has been rookie Ty Sambrailo, the second-round draft choice from Colorado State, at left tackle. That has reinforced the impression the job of succeeding the injured Ryan Clady is Sambrailo\u2019s to lose.\n\n\u201cTy got a ton of reps during the spring,\u201d Barone said. \u201cI don\u2019t see Ty as a rookie mentally anymore. Now, he hasn\u2019t seen any live game reps in this system, but as far as the mental reps and the time-on task and meetings, he is not a rookie in my mind.\u201d\n\nEven when he was coaching tight ends, Barone never was accused of lacking enthusiasm. So it would be unfair to say he has been re-energized. So let\u2019s just say that he\u2019s kicked it up a notch.\n\n\u201cI wake up and just sprint to work every day,\u201d Barone said. \u201cIt\u2019s a blast.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Frei: Clancy Barone feels right at home coaching Broncos\u2019 offensive line", "title": "Frei: Clancy Barone feels right at home coaching Broncos\u2019 offensive line", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/02/frei-clancy-barone-feels-right-at-home-coaching-broncos-offensive-line/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-02T20:50:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-05-23T02:45:14+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Terry Frei"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI\u2019ve been coaching for 30 years and darned near all of them were coaching the offensive line,\u201d Barone, 52, said after Sunday\u2019s practice at Dove Valley.\nBut it was always kind of my career goal to get back home.\u201d\u201cHome\u201d means, among other places, the offensive line meeting room.\nUnder Gary Kubiak, Barone is back to coaching the offensive line.\nFrom 2005-09, Barone coached tight ends for the Falcons and Chargers and, ultimately, for the Broncos in the first year of McDaniels\u2019 tenure.\nA holdover from the Josh McDaniels and John Fox regimes, Barone coached the Denver tight ends the past four seasons under Fox."}
