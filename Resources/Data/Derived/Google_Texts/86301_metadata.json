Jerry Brown (D) this week signed into law a bill (SB 493) that would give more responsibility to certain pharmacists. The measure is designed to ease the increasing burden on primary care providers by having pharmacists help with some of their tasks.\n\nBrown signed the bill, by Sen. Ed Hernandez (D-West Covina), on Tuesday, the same day the state\u2019s health benefit exchange \u2014 Covered California \u2014 launched its initial open enrollment season.\n\nMillions of Californians could become newly insured through the exchange or through the expansion of Medi-Cal \u2014 both slated to begin Jan. 1, 2014 \u2014 and those newly insured could add to the workload of primary care providers in California.\n\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t have the full use of pharmacists\u2019 services, it would be tantamount to inviting guests to come to the table only to find there wasn\u2019t enough food or place settings for everyone,\u201d said Dawn Benton, CEO of the California Society of Health-System Pharmacists.\n\n\u201cAt a time when nearly 70% of Americans are managing their health through daily prescriptions, it only makes good sense to incorporate these skilled medication experts in our health care system,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially as we face a shortage of providers under the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nSB 493 will become law on Jan. 1, 2014. It will allow pharmacists to initiate certain kinds of prescriptions and to provide clinical advice and patient consultation.\n\nThe bill was part of a suite of four bills introduced this year to expand scope of practice for optometrists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other mid-level practitioners.\n\nTwo of those bills, authored by Hernandez, have not made it out of committee: the optometrists\u2019 scope of practice bill (SB 492) and a bill to provide more autonomy for nurse practitioners in California (SB 491).\n\nHernandez has vowed to bring back the nurse practitioner bill in the next session. The fourth bill dealing with scope of practice, SB 352, by Sen. Fran Pavley (D-Agoura Hills), was signed by the governor last month.", "article_metadata": {"description": "<p>Gov.
