Democrats in states where voters want pipeline will face a dilemma over whether to break ranks with Obama and back Republican legislation aimed at forcing the project through.\n\nRepublicans will also try to thwart the executive action on immigration that Obama announced last week and that grants temporary relief from deportation for millions of immigrants who are living in the United States without the right papers.\n\nSeveral Democratic senators have been critical of Obama for taking executive action rather than letting Congress take the lead on the issue. If six or seven joined Republicans, they could block Obama's action, forcing a veto.\n\n'POST-DISASTER SYNDROME'\n\nIn some ways, Schumer's remarks were typical of the kind of \"post-disaster syndrome\" of finger-pointing common after election losses, Baker said.\n\n\"Typically, when a political party has suffered an electoral debacle, one of the first things they do is shoot the survivors,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Schumer, the party lost because the White House messed up on \"a cascade of issues,\" starting with the healthcare reform push in 2009, at a time when Americans were more preoccupied with the recession.\n\nAlso on Schumer's list of White House errors: the rollout of insurance marketplaces, fixing wait lists for veterans' hospitals, dealing with the first case of Ebola in the United States, and even security at the White House itself.\n\nHis remarks illustrated how some Democrats are trying to start to move apart and away from Obama.\n\n\"At this point now, Obama is not running for president again,\" said Matthew Green, associate professor of politics at the Catholic University of America. \"But Democrats in the Senate are, and they want to get back the majority at some point. They are going to be thinking about, what can we say and do to help ourselves in next election cycle?\" Green said.\n\nFormer Obama aides dismissed Schumer's comments as playing politics.\n\n\"Funny, I don't remember Chuck Schumer giving that advice when he was privately and publicly championing the Affordable Care Act in 2010,\" said Jon Favreau, a former White House speechwriter, on Twitter.\n\n\"So what exactly does Chuck Schumer believe was the error? Does he believe that the goal of winning office is winning office?\" said Jon Lovett, another former Obama aide.\n\nTop House Democrat Nancy Pelosi also rebuked Schumer, saying in a statement, \"We come here to do a job, not keep a job.\"\n\n(Additional reporting by Amanda Becker, Emily Stephenson; Editing by Frances Kerry)\n\nAlso on HuffPost: 2014 Election Results: Winners & Losers 2014 Election Results: Winners & Losers\n\n1 of 17 Loser: Political Legacies Despite the help they got on the campaign trail, candidates with family political legacies did not fare well Tuesday. Georgia state Sen. Jason Carter (D), the grandson of former President Jimmy Carter, lost in his bid for the state\u2019s governorship. Democrat Michelle Nunn, the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), lost in Georgia\u2019s Senate race. Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) had assistance from his mother and father, former U.S. Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.), during his re-election campaign. Yet he lost his seat to Rep. Tom Cotton (R). And Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) moved on to a runoff instead of winning re-election outright, despite being the daughter of former New Orleans Mayor Moon Landrieu (D). Perhaps the brightest spot for political offspring on Tuesday was a win for Gwen Graham, the daughter of former U.S. Sen. Bob Graham (D-Fla.). She defeated incumbent Rep. Steve Southerland in Florida\u2019s 2nd Congressional District.
