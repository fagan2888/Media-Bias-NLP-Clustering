Phipps, a professor at the University of Rochester.\n\nAlthough Thy1 was discovered 40 years ago and has been studied in other contexts, its true molecular function has never been known. Phipps\u2019 laboratory reported for the first time that expression of Thy1 is lost during the development of fat cells, suggesting obesity could be treated by restoring Thy1.\n\nRelated: Budget Busting U.S. Obesity Costs Climb Past $300 Billion a Year\n\nThey\u2019re also working towards developing an anti-obesity drug, a Thy1-peptide, and have applied for an international patent to protect the invention. Phipps and colleagues are trying to identify a company to help with commercializing the patent asset and bring a new obesity treatment to the marketplace.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to prevent or reduce obesity and in this paper we\u2019ve shown how to do this in principle,\u201d says Phipps. \u201cWe believe that weight gain is not necessarily just a result of eating more and exercising less. Our focus is on the intricate network involved in fat cell development.\u201d\n\nResearchers studied mice and human cell lines to confirm that a loss of Thy1 function promotes more fat cells. Mice lacking the Thy1 protein and fed a high-fat diet gained more weight and faster, compared to normal mice in a control group that also ate the same high-fat diet.\n\nIn addition, the fatter mice without Thy1 had greater than twice the levels of resistin in their blood, a biomarker for severe obesity and insulin-resistance or diabetes.\n\nRelated: How the Obesity Epidemic Drains Medicare and Medicaid\n\nExperiments using human fatty tissue from the abdomen and eyes showed similar results.\n\nBorn that way?\n\nPhipps and colleagues, including key researcher Collynn Woeller, a research assistant professor of environmental medicine, are continuing to investigate why cells with the potential to turn into fat cells lose the Thy1 protein, and why fat accumulates faster when Thy1 shuts off.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear whether Thy1 levels are different in people at birth, or whether they change with time and exposure to various environmental agents.\n\nTo address the latter question, Phipps\u2019 laboratory is separately studying whether chemicals known as obesogens\u2013such as bisphenol A (BPA), flame retardants, and phthalates\u2013reduce Thy1 expression in human cells and promote obesity. That study is funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. The work reported in FASEB was funded by the National Institutes of Health, as well as grants from the Rochester/Finger lakes Eye & Tissue Bank and the Research to Prevent Blindness Foundation.\n\nSource: University of Rochester.
