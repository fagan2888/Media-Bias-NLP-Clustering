Nearly 13 million Americans age 50 to 64 who lack insurance or buy private health plans would be eligible to buy into an expanded Medicare program that the Democratic presidential contender has proposed, according to an analysis released Thursday.

The Avalere Health consultancy, which conducted the analysis, said those currently without health insurance in that age group — about 7 million or so people — could "potentially benefit" from Clinton's proposal.

But Avalere's report also said "it is not immediately evident that Medicare coverage would be a better option for all people over 50," as some of them would face higher costs if they moved into the new coverage option.



Avalere's analysis comes more than a week after Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, said at a campaign event that "I'm also in favor of what's called the public option, so that people can buy into Medicare at a certain age."
