Jezebel\n\nSanta Barbara, Calif., yoga studio Power of Your Om is in some hot water this week after a flier for its \u201cghetto fabulous\u201d event went viral. The invite asked participants to come dressed in their \u201cfavorite ghetto fabulous outfit\u201d and wear \u201csnap-back caps, corn rows, heavy lip liner\u201d \u2014 sparking outrage with people who found the event both offensive and racist.\n\n\u201cYou and your staff need to immediately go to some sort of workshop dealing with white supremacy,\u201d wrote Margaret Goldstein on the studio\u2019s Facebook wall. \u201cThat \u2018ghetto fabulous\u2019 incident tells not only a lot about the leadership, but is a reflection of your customers as well-so maybe you should start funding anti-racist workshops in your space as well as yoga-now that would be an apology + ACTION.\u201d\n\nSanta Barbara\u2019s population is about 75 percent white and only about 1.6 percent black. The initial posting went largely unnoticed, with just a dozen or so complaints. Now, after the class has taken place and the photos were picked up by news outlets like the Daily News and Jezebel, the studio\u2019s founder, Adrienne Hengels, is extremely apologetic. She even renamed the class \u201cHip Hop Yoga\u201d to appease any lingering offense.\n\n\u201cIt was just meant to be a yoga class with rap music,\u201d said Hengels. \u201cHaving that additional piece with \u2018ghetto fabulous\u2019 was a mistake. I didn\u2019t realize the stupidity of it until afterwards.\u201d\n\nThe problem with the class, as Huffington Post writer Amanda Scherker put it, is that it\u2019s a misguided white American appropriation of black culture \u2014 not unlike Miley Cyrus\u2019s \u201ctwerking\u201d performance at the MTV Video Music Awards. Just as Cyrus\u2019s mimicking of a dance that originated among black woman is not representative of the black American experience, neither are hip hop music, corn rows, and dark lip liner. Bad, \u201cghetto,\u201d and unattractive behavior has somehow become synonymous with black culture in these instances. It illustrates negative stereotypes that some have placed on the African American experience and, consequently, are interpreted by many as racist.\n\nThe studio posted another apology on its Facebook wall on Sunday:\n\n\u201cThank you all for the eye-opening discussion and I do apologize for offending anyone - those of you that commented, emailed, and anyone else for that matter. The class happened and we are doing other themed classes in the future that may include various types of music/genres and we have made note to focus on the music versus singling out any group of human beings that has the potential to offend others as that was not the intention. I can see how it could be offensive and we do apologize for offending you or anyone.\u201d\n\nBut some still felt the apology was too little, too late.\n\n\"Wont be going to this studio. Looking for a good class. Any recommendations for non racist ones?\" someone posted.\n\nGhetto Fabulous Yoga Flier ConstantContact.com Ghetto Fabulous Yoga Participant Jezebel The entire class.
