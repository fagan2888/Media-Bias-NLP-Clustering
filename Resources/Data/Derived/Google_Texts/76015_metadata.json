But fewer than 20% of physicians were willing to see an uninsured patient unless they were paid in full up front.\n\nPeople with no health insurance have few problems making appointments at a primary care physicians' offices, but they likely will have difficulty paying for it, research shows.\n\n\n\nBrendan Saloner\n\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health conducted a telephone survey of 1,613 primary care physicians' offices in 10 states in late 2012 and early 2013, before Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe callers, posing as uninsured patients seeking routine care, found that nearly 80% of the primary care physicians were willing to schedule an appointment. Office visit fees ranged from a low of $128 in Pennsylvania, to a high of $188 in Oregon, and a 10-state average price of $160 for a basic checkup or hypertension evaluation. The callers did not request prices quotes for blood work, imaging, or lab tests.\n\nOnly 6% of callers were told they were refused an appointment because they had no insurance. However, fewer than 20% of the physicians were willing to see the uninsured patients unless they paid the full cost up front. The study was published Monday in Health Affairs.\n\n\"The message here is that the uninured can get appointments at some price. They don't experience more difficulties with private insurance, but it costs a lot of money,\" says Brendan Saloner, the study's lead author and an assistant professor of Health Policy and Management. \"The kinds of prices that callers in our study were being quoted would represent a real financial burden for the typically uninsured person.\"\n\nEven with the advent of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Saloner says the study's findings remain relevant because 22 states have declined to expand their Medicaid roles.\n\n\"In states where Medicaid expansion has not taken off because the state made the decision not to expand the program the reality of 2012\u20132013 is pretty much representative of what life is like today,\" Saloner says.\n\n\"The big unknown is how things are evolving on the provider side, their capacity to see different kinds of patients, and whether the prices they are charging in this evolving market are going up or going down. Either of those would be possible, but we don't know for right now.\"\n\nSaloner says there was no sense in the study that physicians were jacking up prices to discourage uninsured patients.\n\n\"I don't think they're in the business of frightening people away,\" he says. \"While there are some prices that were quoted that were so high that it wouldn't be realistic for a typical patient, more typically they were offering similar prices. The prices they were quoting were what that office felt like they should be trying to get as a standard rate from a self-paying client.\"", "article_metadata": {"MobileOptimized": "width", "viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "In a study, only 6% of would-be patients were told they were refused an appointment because they were not covered by a health plan.
