Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the service was working to address questions raised by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain about the Northrop contract, which he fears could leave the U.S. government liable for potential cost increases on the program.

James said the contract had already been signed, and it would potentially raise the cost to cancel and then redo that deal.
