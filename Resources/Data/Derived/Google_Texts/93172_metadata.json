Pat McCrory noting the company\u2019s opposition, as reported by WRAL earlier this morning.\n\nFrom Greenberg\u2019s letter:\n\nIBM has a large number of employees and retirees in North Carolina and is gravely concerned that this legislation, if enacted, would enable discrimination based on a person\u2019s sexual orientation or identity. We call on members of the Legislature to defeat this bill. Our perspective is grounded in IBM\u2019s 104-year history and our deep legacy of diversity and inclusion \u2014 a legacy to which we remain strongly committed today. IBM is opposed to discrimination against anyone on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation or religion. We urge you to work with the Legislature to ensure that any legislation in this area is not discriminatory.\n\nSeveral other tech companies have spoken against the bill, which would allow businesses to choose who they do work for based on religious beliefs. Opponents have said that essentially is a license to discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender residents. Similar legislation that became law in Indiana ignited a national firestorm of opposition.\n\nRed Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst wrote earlier this month that his Raleigh-based company embraces diversity and called the oroposed North Carolina legislation \u201cdivisive\u201d and harmful to the state\u2019s economy.\n\nLtr_NCMcCrory_RFRA_040715.pdf by NC Policy Watch", "article_metadata": {"fb": {"pages": 71966175060}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://pulse.ncpolicywatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/cropped-logo_shadow-square-270x270.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0c6a\"", "article_summary": "The company\u2019s senior executive in North Carolina, Robert Greenberg, wrote a letter to Gov.\nRed Hat CEO Jim Whitehurst wrote earlier this month that his Raleigh-based company embraces diversity and called the oroposed North Carolina legislation \u201cdivisive\u201d and harmful to the state\u2019s economy.\nIBM, which employs thousands in the Triangle area, doesn\u2019t want North Carolina to adopt a controversial religious freedom bill that opponents say would allow discrimination against the LGBT community.\nIBM is opposed to discrimination against anyone on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation or religion.\nSeveral other tech companies have spoken against the bill, which would allow businesses to choose who they do work for based on religious beliefs."}
