Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) to the top Democratic Senate leadership spot may have swayed Manchin\u2019s decision.\n\nManchin is believed to have a much warmer relationship with Schumer than Sen. Harry Reid (Nev.), who is retiring after his current term.\n\nSchumer will replace Reid as Senate minority leader after Reid departs the 114th Congress.\n\nManchin additionally endorsed 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during his CBS appearance Sunday. The West Virginia lawmaker praised her work in all walks of politics as the reason behind his decision.\n\n\u201cI personally believe Hillary Clinton is the best person to do this job for America,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has more experience than any other person we can get at that level.\u201d\n\n--This report was updated at 12:31 a.m.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The Democrat announced he will stay in the Senate.", "description": "The Democrat announced he will stay in the Senate.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Ballot Box"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The Democrat announced he will stay in the Senate.", "title": "Manchin won't run for W.Va. governor", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/239340-manchin-will-seek-third-senate-term", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/2014-07-22-gn-manchin-joe-1.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-04-20T11:22:16-04:00", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/239340-manchin-will-seek-third-senate-term", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The Democrat announced he will stay in the Senate.", "card": "summary", "title": "Manchin won't run for W.Va. governor"}, "dcterms.modified": "2015-04-20T11:22-04:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/239340-manchin-will-seek-third-senate-term", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-19T11:22-04:00", "dcterms.creator": "Kyle Balluck", "author": "Mark Hensch", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-19T11:22:40-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-04-20T11:22:16-04:00"}, "keywords": "Sunday shows,Joe Manchin,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.title": "Manchin won't run for W.Va. governor"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd151f\"", "article_summary": "The West Virginia lawmaker praised her work in all walks of politics as the reason behind his decision.\nManchin is believed to have a much warmer relationship with Schumer than Sen.
