Now, the Senate is stonewalling, with Democrats voting repeatedly not to take up the bill, insisting instead that Republicans pass a bill funding the executive amnesty along with the rest of the DHS.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nWhich means that we\u2019re nearing Republican surrender.\n\nSpeaker of the House John Boehner (R-OH) maintains that it is time for Democrats in the Senate \u201cto get off their ass and do something other than vote \u2018no.\u2019\u201d But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is preparing the groundwork for the cave, stating, \u201cI think it\u2019s clear we can\u2019t go forward in the Senate unless you all have heard something I haven\u2019t. And so the next move, obviously, is up to the House.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s nonsense. When Republicans represented the Senate minority during the Obamacare shutdown, the media declared that Republicans were obstructionists. Now that Democrats are in the minority, the shoe is on the other foot. And despite Republican fears that the Obamacare shutdown would crush electoral prospects, Republicans won a sweeping victory in 2014.\n\nBut Republican leaders are frightened nonetheless. They are frightened of media members blaming them for any flaws in security stemming from DHS funding, and too afraid to say what Sen. Mark Kirk (R-IL) has correctly said:\n\nIt\u2019s a very dangerous game. If we have a successful terrorist attack \u2013 all the dead Americans from that should be laid at the feet of the Democratic caucus\u2026In the end, [Democrats] have to defend the country. They have sworn the allegiance to do that. They need to live up to their oaths of office. In the Democratic mind, politics is everything. I would say to them, politics is not everything. If you don\u2019t have a country to defend, what is the purpose of politics?\n\nMany top Republicans don\u2019t have Kirk\u2019s backbone. And so they fall into the trap of blaming other Republicans for a DHS shutdown even though Democrats are fully responsible for that shutdown. Or, more cynically, they seek to garner mainstream media love for throwing their colleagues under the bus.\n\nSenator Bob Corker (R-TN) says, \u201cI certainly do not think that\u2019s a good idea at this time, when we have lots of national security interests.\u201d Senator John McCain (R-AZ) said, when asked how to avert a shutdown, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know\u2026We should not cut off funding for the Department of Homeland Security.\u201d Senator John Thune (R-SD) agreed: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to shut the government down, including that. We recognize it\u2019s important that we fund the government. Now that we are in the majority, we have the responsibility to do that.\u201d Senator Jim Risch (R-ID) added, \u201cWe are unable to get on this bill to amend it. And a result of that, the House is going to have to send us another bill that we can get on.\u201d Democrats, Risch said, \u201care locked up against it.\u201d He concluded, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201d\n\nRepublicans could stand tall. But in the Senate, they won\u2019t. They could force Democrats to keep filibustering \u2013 and they could force an actual filibuster, rather than the pro forma filibuster to which Americans have grown accustomed. They could invoke the nuclear option and kill the filibuster altogether, forcing President Obama to veto funding for the Department of Homeland Security. They could even split the DHS funding bill into separate smaller bills funding each section of DHS specifically, and forcing Democrats to stonewall those bills.\n\nOr they could wait for Boehner to cave. And it seems that the latter possibility is also the most likely. On Wednesday, Senators Cory Gardner (R-CO) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) told House Republicans that they couldn\u2019t get the 60 votes necessary to put the bill to a vote. House Republicans, for now, told the two Senators to go back to the Senate and work on it.\n\nBut several members of the House have already come out in favor of a cave. Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) said, \u201cI didn\u2019t necessarily think this was the best ground to fight on because I\u2019ve seen this movie before.\u201d Rep. Mike Simpson (R-ID) told CNN yesterday, \u201cWe won\u2019t shut the government down, that would be really, really stupid.\u201d Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA) said, \u201cFrom a political perspective \u2026 you\u2019re better off passing a clean Homeland Security appropriations bill, because it makes a lot of important changes, many of this in the Republican side wanted \u2014 more detention beds and all sorts of improvements of border control.\u201d\n\nThe Republican leadership is still split on the immigration issue. But it\u2019s unlikely that they\u2019ll remain split for long. When in doubt, bet on surrender.\n\nBen Shapiro is Senior Editor-At-Large of Breitbart News and author of the new book, The People vs. Barack Obama: The Criminal Case Against The Obama Administration (Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014).
