We had made it less than 100 yards before our skijoring instructor hit the snow-covered turf in a tangle of skis, poles and bungee cord.\n\n\u201cNo problem,\u201d professional dog trainer Louisa Morrissey said as she regained her feet. \u201cThe most important requirement for dog skijoring is a sense of humor.\u201d\n\nMorrissey, a 15-year practitioner of the Scandinavian sport that teams cross country skiers with their dogs, has pretty much seen it all. Her Silverthorne-based High Country Dogs training business originated under the title of Skijor-n-More, where she combined her passions for dogs and cross country skiing to establish a niche in Colorado\u2019s alpine canine community.\n\n\u201cI had these two pointers that were so high-energy, and I really couldn\u2019t get them the exercise they needed in the wintertime,\u201d said Morrissey, a longtime nordic skiing instructor and former president of the Colorado Cross Country Ski Association. \u201cWhen I saw skijoring, I was like, \u2018Here we go.\u2019 I already cross country skied, and it\u2019s just a great fit for these hunting breeds that love to run and often need something to do in winter.\u201d\n\nWhile many Coloradans are more familiar with the winter carnival attraction of skiers racing behind horses, dog skijoring is a bit more akin to dogsledding. Teams of one to three dogs are fitted with sled dog harnesses and hooked up to a skier\u2019s harness with a bungee and a short length of dynamic rope. There are no reins, just the skier\u2019s commands and the dog\u2019s desire to run.\n\nWith fast teams pushing the 20 mph mark, the Rocky Mountain Sled Dog Club offers skijoring divisions at several of its winter races, giving competitive types something to aspire to. But for many dog owners, simply enjoying a day on the snow with their dogs is enough.\n\nTo that end, Morrissey conducts clinics for beginners at ski touring destinations across Colorado, including Devil\u2019s Thumb Ranch near Tabernash and Frisco Peninsula in Summit County. Participants should bring their own dogs and should be comfortable on cross country skis.\n\n\u201cMy focus is on positive reinforcement and relationship building,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is just a great, easy sport for people to do to get their dogs exercise, which also solves a lot of behavioral problems. And it builds a really nice bond.\u201d\n\nThrough her evolution as a certified dog trainer and a member of the Victoria Stilwell (from Animal Planet\u2019s \u201cIt\u2019s Me or the Dog\u201d) Positively Dog Training Team, Morrissey has come to recognize the benefits of providing pets with both exercise and a task to focus on.\n\nThe desire, and ability, to ski are the most important prerequisites on the human side. Depending upon terrain, any touring skis \u2014 classic, skate or telemark \u2014 will do. With some coaching, dogs often figure out their role in less than an hour.\n\n\u201cAny dog can do it, especially at a recreational level,\u201d said Morrissey, who prefers to ski behind border collies. \u201cWhat I really look at is the human-dog team, whether the weight of the skier and ability of the skier matches the dog. A small dog, obviously, with a heavier person who can\u2019t ski very well would not be a good combination. But a lot of it is just doing it and finding a rhythm together.\u201d\n\nFinding a dog-friendly place to practice is also imperative, and there may be no better spot in Colorado than Devil\u2019s Thumb Ranch, which rents skijoring harnesses to guests and opens several miles of groomed trails to skiers with leashed dogs. High Country Dogs will host five beginner skijoring clinics at Devil\u2019s Thumb this winter, including one Sunday and others Feb. 15 and March 15.\n\nAdditional clinics will take place in Frisco (on Feb. 22 and March 14), and the shortlist of dog-friendly ski destinations extends to Tennessee Pass, Breckenridge Nordic Center, Snow Mountain Ranch, Crested Butte and the Aspen Golf Course, along with a few other groomed trails. Most of Colorado\u2019s skijoring terrain will be found on jeep roads and snowmobile trails, however.\n\n\u201cAs president of the Cross Country Ski Association, I realized there are probably over 1,000 kilometers of groomed trails in Colorado and maybe, at the most, 50 kilometers of those are dog friendly. So it\u2019s a small percentage and I think it really speaks to, as dog owners, if we behave responsibly we can maybe ask for a little bit more,\u201d Morrissey said. \u201cAnd skijoring is perfect as a dog sport, because by nature they are on-leash at all times.\u201d\n\nOf course, that can also create its own breed of comedy with an excited young ski dog, like mine.\n\nScott Willoughby: swilloughby@ denverpost.com or twitter.com/ swilloughby", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Willoughby: Skijoring provides a great way to exercise yourself and your dogs", "title": "Willoughby: Skijoring provides a great way to exercise yourself and your dogs", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/01/31/willoughby-skijoring-provides-a-great-way-to-exercise-yourself-and-your-dogs/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-31T18:28:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T08:27:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Fishing, hunting"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdeb10\"", "article_summary": "Her Silverthorne-based High Country Dogs training business originated under the title of Skijor-n-More, where she combined her passions for dogs and cross country skiing to establish a niche in Colorado\u2019s alpine canine community.\nHigh Country Dogs will host five beginner skijoring clinics at Devil\u2019s Thumb this winter, including one Sunday and others Feb. 15 and March 15.\n\u201cThe most important requirement for dog skijoring is a sense of humor.\u201dMorrissey, a 15-year practitioner of the Scandinavian sport that teams cross country skiers with their dogs, has pretty much seen it all.\nParticipants should bring their own dogs and should be comfortable on cross country skis.\n\u201cThis is just a great, easy sport for people to do to get their dogs exercise, which also solves a lot of behavioral problems."}
