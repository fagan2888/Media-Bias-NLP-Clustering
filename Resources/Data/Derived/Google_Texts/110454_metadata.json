Like previous ones, both ads star people who say they\u2019ve been victimized by the law.\n\nBut if you watch both spots carefully, you\u2019ll note something interesting: Both ads refrain from making any kind of pronouncement about the law\u2019s overall impact on the people it features.\n\nThis looks like a shift from the AFP ad featuring a cancer victim in Michigan that has drawn so much attention. In that ad, Julie Boonstra claimed she\u2019d lost her old plan due to Obamacare, and that her new plan has led to out of pocket costs that are so high, her new plan is \u201cunaffordable.\u201d When Glenn Kessler debunked the claim, he noted that her premiums had come down so much that overall costs were probably a wash.\n\nThat ad met an aggressive response from Democrats, with Gary Peters, the Dem Senate candidate in Michigan, calling on some TV stations to pull the ad until AFP presents \u201cfactual support for its claims.\u201d\n\nThe new AFP ads carefully skirt making any such claim along the lines of the one Boonstra made. Here is the spot hitting Dem Rep. Carol Shea-Porter:\n\nAnd here is the spot hitting Dem Rep. Annie Kuster:\n\nThe woman in the first ad claims that her out of pocket costs for prescription drugs have gone up, and that some medicines \u201cmay\u201d not be covered. But unlike the Boonstra ad, it doesn\u2019t say anything about her overall costs being unaffordable. For all we know, if her replacement plan had lower premiums, her overall costs may be a wash (as they appear to be for Boonstra) or they may have even gone down. In contrast to Boonstra \u2014 who did make a blanket claim about the law\u2019s overall impact on her finances, which led to the ad being debunked \u2014 this New Hampshire woman doesn\u2019t say one way or the other what the overall impact has been.\n\nThe second ad, meanwhile, features a woman claiming she is \u201cnot even sure if I can keep my doctor or go to the hospital of my choice.\u201d In fairness, this appears to be a real issue in New Hampshire, where there is only one insurer offering plans on the exchange, which has resulted in a narrowing of networks. But we still have no way of knowing what her overall experience from the law has been.\n\nBoth ads lean very heavily on the false claim by Obama and some Dems that if you like your plan, you can keep it. Republicans are hitting this falsehood with the strategic goal of undermining the credibility of Dems in a broader sense, separate from more focused questions about the law\u2019s actual impact on people. For all I know this could work \u2014 perhaps Dems are vulnerable to this attack.\n\nBut the point is, in ads like these, the charge is basically that any disruption from health reform is a bad thing, because it creates uncertainty. (Never mind that conservative and Republican health care reform ideas would also cause disruptions.) What\u2019s being left unstated is whether the overall tale befits its designation as another \u201cObamacare horror story.\u201d In the case of the two ads above, if we knew their full stories, perhaps their overall experiences would be demonstratively a net negative. But those full stories are not being told.\n\nAnd so, the case against Obamacare, in these ads, rests heavily on the initial falsehood and the generalized claim of subsequent uncertainty to create the overall impression of untold numbers of people getting shafted by it.\n\nIn this context, it\u2019s crucial to understand that a key part of this campaign is to actively dissuade comprehensive factual examination of these victims\u2019 stories. And so, in some narratives, key details are left out. In others \u2014 such as the case of Boonstra \u2014 AFP has explicitly equated factual scrutiny of the AFP ad she appeared in with trying to silence a terminally ill cancer victim.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Americans for Prosperity explicitly seeks to dissuade factual scrutiny of its ads.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "Americans for Prosperity explicitly seeks to dissuade factual scrutiny of its ads.", "title": "More Obamacare horror stories: Do they add up?", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/02/24/more-obamacare-horror-stories-do-they-add-up/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/files/2014/01/State_of_Union-0cf7c_image_982w.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theplumlinegs"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2014/02/24/more-obamacare-horror-stories-do-they-add-up/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "americans for prosperity, obamacare, Obamacare horror stories, Koch brothers,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "americans for prosperity, obamacare, Obamacare horror stories, Koch brothers,"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe12ce\"", "article_summary": "This looks like a shift from the AFP ad featuring a cancer victim in Michigan that has drawn so much attention.\nIn others \u2014 such as the case of Boonstra \u2014 AFP has explicitly equated factual scrutiny of the AFP ad she appeared in with trying to silence a terminally ill cancer victim.\nBut unlike the Boonstra ad, it doesn\u2019t say anything about her overall costs being unaffordable.\nBut if you watch both spots carefully, you\u2019ll note something interesting: Both ads refrain from making any kind of pronouncement about the law\u2019s overall impact on the people it features.\nWhat\u2019s being left unstated is whether the overall tale befits its designation as another \u201cObamacare horror story.\u201d In the case of the two ads above, if we knew their full stories, perhaps their overall experiences would be demonstratively a net negative."}
