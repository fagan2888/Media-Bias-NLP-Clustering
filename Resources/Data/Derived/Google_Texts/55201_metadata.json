What the Times-Picayune knows:\n\nAll the victims were in stable condition. Ten were taken to the hospital by ambulance and six went to the hospital on their own.\n\nPolice have not yet named a suspect or suspects. New Orleans police chief Michael Harrison said he believed there were several shooters. The shooting took place at an after-party and music video filming that followed the annual Nine Times Social and Pleasure Club second-line. The second-line had permits and police staffed it \"pretty heavily,\" Harrison said. The music video filming may have been separately organized and did not have a permit.\n\nWitnesses saw a man with a silver-colored machine gun flee toward Louisa Street. Gunfire continued in the park after he left. It appears to be the largest mass shooting in New Orleans since the Mother's Day second-line of 2013.\n\nMore info here.\n\nAs Jesse Walker reminds me, it's not clear that this crime scene, however terrifying, meets the definition of either a mass shooting (there have been no fatalities) or even an active shooting event (since it was a shootout between two groups).\n\nAccording to the Brady Center To Prevent Gun Violence, a pro-gun-control group, Louisiana has some of the weakest gun laws in the country and received an \"F\" in its 2013 scorecard.\n\nA recent Politico survey of mayors found 90 percent of them agreeing with the statement that \"that Congress is doing too little on issues of firearm regulation and gun violence.\"\n\n\u201cFailure to address an issue that amounts to slow-motion mass murder of American citizens, many of whom are black and brown, is political cowardice. Stand up! Do the right thing,\u201d said Mayor Sly James of Kansas City, Missouri. Chula Vista Mayor Mary Salas said she had a simple message for Congress: \u201cGet a backbone\u2014do your job.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the New Orleans shooting, expect more calls for gun control as the only way to reduce violent crime. As Thomas A. Firey wrote at Reason.com last month, however, shows that the connection between stronger gun laws and fatal shooting is neither simple nor clear. Firey ran variations on a recent popular piece in National Journal that claimed a clear correlation between the number of gun-related deaths and the number of gun laws at the state level. More laws, the article argued, meant fewer gun deaths. Firey found\n\nIn half of the 14 tests, the resulting coefficients were positive numbers, meaning that Isenstein\u2019s gun restrictions had no more than a coin-flip chance of yielding the results that gun control supporters expect. Moreover, in all 14 cases, the coefficients were tiny, with nine smaller than +/\u2013 0.1. Those results should make us highly skeptical that the gun laws have any effect\u2014positive or negative\u2014on murder and violent crime.\n\nRead the whole thing here.\n\nSince the mid-1990s, there has been an essentially uninterrupted decline in violent crime and gun-related crime (including homicide; suicides, which account for 2/3 of gun deaths, have been relatively flat). That drop continued through 2014, the numbers for which the FBI released a couple of months ago. A number of cities in the United States have seen spikes in gun-related homicides in 2015\u2014Chicago is up 20 percent through the end of September; Houston is up 33 percent; and San Francisco is up 25 percent\u2014but it's also true that many large cities have seen declines as well. Five Thirty Eight's Carl Bialik notes that\n\nMost of these changes aren\u2019t statistically significant on a city level. Even amid the national upward trend, and in some of the country\u2019s most populous cities, homicides remain, thankfully, a rare event. That means some increases that look large on a percentage basis affect the raw totals only slightly, to an extent that could arise by chance alone. A 20 percent increase in Seattle sounds a lot more significant than an increase to 18 homicides from 15 through Aug. 29. Homicides in Arlington, Texas, through Aug. 31 are down by 50 percent \u2014 to four from eight.\n\nWhatever the trendlines, expect presidential candidates such as Hillary Clinton to use the New Orleans shooting as the newest reason to pass simple-minded and ultimately ineffective gun control.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Expect new calls for gun control from mayors, Hillary Clinton.", "title": "New Orleans Shooting Details: 16 Shot During Outdoor Party", "url": "http://reason.com/blog/2015/11/23/new-orleans-shooting-details-16-shot-dur", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14482833086001.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Expect new calls for gun control from mayors, Hillary Clinton.", "title": "New Orleans Shooting Details: 16 Shot During Outdoor Party", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14482833086001.jpg", "creator": "@nickgillespie", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "Nanny State", "published_time": "2015-11-23T13:28:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/nick-gillespie"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "article_summary": "It appears to be the largest mass shooting in New Orleans since the Mother's Day second-line of 2013.\nAccording to the New Orleans Times-Picayune, 16 people were shot last night during a long-planned and city-permitted party at Bunny Friend Park.\nThose results should make us highly skeptical that the gun laws have any effect\u2014positive or negative\u2014on murder and violent crime.\nWhatever the trendlines, expect presidential candidates such as Hillary Clinton to use the New Orleans shooting as the newest reason to pass simple-minded and ultimately ineffective gun control.\nAs Thomas A.
