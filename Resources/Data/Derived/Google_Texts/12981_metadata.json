Tony Keck said hospitals with facility costs and debt will remain in conflict financially with private insurers and government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, until they get paid to keep those beds empty.\n\nKeck, director of the Department of Health and Human Services, took part in a Tuesday panel discussion about the future of health care with Dr. Angelo Sinopoli, the Greenville Health System\u2019s vice president of clinical integration and chief medical officer and Matthew Shaffer, senior vice president for the major group unit at BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina.\n\nKeck also said that hospitals, while caught in a system that pays them for keeping beds occupied, are also having to deal with only about 60% of those beds in South Carolina being filled.\n\n\u201cFor any of you who run industries that depend on keeping your resources employed, you know that once you start hitting 60% and going lower that your business model is soon facing some serious challenges,\u201d he said.\n\nKeck said the Medicaid program provides health coverage for about 1 million people, and the way hospitals make money is the \u201copposite of where we\u2019re going.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe answer isn\u2019t to try to fill more beds,\u201d Keck said after the panel discussion at the Rotary Club of Greenville. \u201cThe answer is that hospitals have to start thinking about themselves differently as health systems. And we have to, as payers, figure out how to pay them differently, because right now the way hospitals make money is by filling beds, and that\u2019s because the payers like Medicare, Medicaid and BlueCross pay them to do that. Until we start paying them to keep those beds empty and to invest in primary care and other outpatient services, they are going to continue to struggle with this occupancy problem.\u201d\n\nKeck said there are continuing discussions about \u201chow can the state and how can Medicaid work with BlueCross, for instance, to help transition that system from this bed-heavy system\u201d to the new outpatient system.\n\nShaffer said that since the outset of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 the only S.C.-owned and -operated health insurer has had more than 100 people a day working on the changes, including those changes that have turned out to be temporary. He predicted more consumerism, which could include \u201cmore consumers spending for themselves,\u201d as employers hand off coverage decisions.\n\nSinopoli said collaboration among all parties involved in health care is ongoing, and he predicted more consolidations of health care systems.\n\n\u201cWe have to find ways in health care to change ways we deliver care and the way you access care through technology and other mechanisms,\u201d Sinopoli said, adding that there will be less \u201cface-to-face\u201d time with doctors.", "article_metadata": {}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd86d5\"", "article_summary": "Sinopoli said collaboration among all parties involved in health care is ongoing, and he predicted more consolidations of health care systems.\n\u201cWe have to find ways in health care to change ways we deliver care and the way you access care through technology and other mechanisms,\u201d Sinopoli said, adding that there will be less \u201cface-to-face\u201d time with doctors.\n\u201cThe answer is that hospitals have to start thinking about themselves differently as health systems.\nHe predicted more consumerism, which could include \u201cmore consumers spending for themselves,\u201d as employers hand off coverage decisions.\nBy Bill Pooveybpoovey@scbiznews.comPublished Jan. 15, 2014South Carolina\u2019s Medicaid director said hospitals need to find ways to break free from their dependence on a system that makes them fill beds to make money."}
