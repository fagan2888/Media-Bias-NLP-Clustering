That\u2019s because those people wound up having a higher income than they estimated when they applied and received the the tax credits.\n\nAnticipating that some people would be unaware of the ACA noninsurance penalty until they filed their taxes, the federal government has offered a special enrollment period through April 30 to enable people without insurance to apply for coverage through for the insurance marketplace.\n\nWhile this won\u2019t help people avoid the 2014 penalty, the special enrollment period will give them the chance avoid two years of penalties. The regular open enrollment period for the marketplace ended on Feb. 15. Open enrollment for 2016 will start on Nov. 1.\n\nThe penalty for being uninsured in 2014, which the federal government calls the \u201cindividual shared responsibility payment,\u201d is the greater amount of $95 per person or 1 percent of household income.\n\nOnly the amount above the threshold for filing federal income taxes, which is $10,150 for an individual and $20,300 for a couple filing jointly, is used to calculate the penalty.\n\nFor example, a couple who are both uninsured, with a household income of $40,300, would pay a penalty of $200 (1 percent of $20,000, which is the difference between their income and the filing threshold).\n\nThe penalties for being uninsured are rising for 2015 to the higher of $325 per person or 2 percent of income before reaching their permanent level, in 2016, of the greater of $695 per person or 2.5 percent of income.\n\nSherry Diamond, president of Cherry Hill tax preparation business Tax Stop Inc., said most of her customers who have to pay the penalty knew about the individual mandate.\n\n\u201cI get these guilty looks, like a little sad puppy with their tail between their legs,\u201d she said.\n\nDiamond expected to have more customers paying the penalty than has been the case.\n\nA bigger issue has been people who received a larger subsidy to buy marketplace insurance than they were entitled to get and have to pay back back part of the subsidy.\n\nFor example, if a person was paid more than they previously estimated, they would have to pay the tax credit through their tax return, even if neither that person nor the government did anything wrong.\n\n\u201cThe ones who\u2019ve been upset are the ones who got too much premium tax credit and had to give some back \u2013 that part of the law, they just didn\u2019t understand,\u201d Diamond said.\n\nShe added that has advised some customers who have received incorrect documents from the federal government about their marketplace insurance status last year to file for extensions.\n\nDiamond said that the uninsured will feel more pressure to enroll in future years, as the tax penalty rises. However, she anticipates that some people will still choose to forgo insurance if it would cost significantly more than the penalty.\n\n\u201cI think when it gets to the point where the penalty gets close to where they can actually buy insurance for, then they\u2019re going to get insurance,\u201d Diamond said.\n\nShe cited as an example a family choosing between $2,000 in penalties and $6,000 to $7,000 in annual marketplace insurance premiums\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll take a $2,000 hit on taxes rather than pay thousands of dollars for insurance that they don\u2019t want,\u201d she said.\n\nSome low-income tax filers have benefited from nonprofit organizations that offer tax-preparation services. One of those is New Jersey Citizen Action, which offered tax-filing assistance in its Newark office.\n\nCrystal Eshanov, who coordinated the volunteer income-tax assistance program for Citizen Action, noted that most of her clients qualify for NJ FamilyCare, which grew last year under the ACA Medicaid eligibility expansion.\n\nEshanov said some of the agency\u2019s remaining uninsured clients have gone straight from filing their taxes to enrolling in marketplace insurance. But others who are uninsured didn\u2019t feel much sting from the individual mandate tax penalty.\n\n\u201cMost of them didn\u2019t feel it as hard as they could have because they were also receiving\u201d large tax refunds that made the penalties appear small, Eshanov said. \u201cIf it was $90 on top of a $4,000 refund, they weren\u2019t really saying too much about it.\u201d\n\nThose who choose not to sign up for insurance represent a challenge for those groups who are working to increase enrollment.\n\n\u201cSome of the people would rather still pay the penalty,\u201d Eshanov said. \u201cOften, they would say it\u2019s still not affordable.\u201d\n\nOthers have worked with Citizen Action counselors to fill out a marketplace enrollment application only to put the application on hold when they find out what the premiums will cost, she said.\n\nEshanov said that Citizen Action\u2019s tax preparers did tell their clients that the penalties for being uninsured will be increasing over the next two years.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s cheaper for them to take a hit, if they don\u2019t qualify for the tax credit, they\u2019ll say, \u2018I\u2019ll just deal with the penalty,\u2019 \u201d Eshanov said.\n\nA few groups who are exempt from the penalty, including those who can\u2019t find insurance that will cost less than 8 percent of their income and those whose income is below the threshold for filing a tax return. In addition, those who aren\u2019t eligible for marketplace insurance, such as undocumented immigrants, also don\u2019t have to pay the penalty.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://assets.njspotlight.com/assets/15/0212/0019"}, "google-site-verification": "eSiTqCyhbNrILKPNvPOLORFjlPbqSQLW3WfNOcpjdcg", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "NJ Spotlight", "description": "Some earned more than they anticipated when they received subsidies,  while others didn\u2019t obtain mandated coverage", "viewport": "width = device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd720\"", "article_summary": "Diamond said that the uninsured will feel more pressure to enroll in future years, as the tax penalty rises.\nIn addition, those who aren\u2019t eligible for marketplace insurance, such as undocumented immigrants, also don\u2019t have to pay the penalty.\nBut others who are uninsured didn\u2019t feel much sting from the individual mandate tax penalty.\nShe added that has advised some customers who have received incorrect documents from the federal government about their marketplace insurance status last year to file for extensions.\nEshanov said some of the agency\u2019s remaining uninsured clients have gone straight from filing their taxes to enrolling in marketplace insurance."}
