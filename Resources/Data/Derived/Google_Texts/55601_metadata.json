The Gamecock duo beat out 44 teams in front of their hometown crowd to win the top award of a new Ranger Z117 with a 90-horsepower outboard and entry into the 2015 Forrest Wood Cup, the world championship of bass fishing.\n\n\u201cI don't know what the greatest part of this moment is,\u201d said an overwhelmed Patrick Walters, a sophomore majoring in Business. \u201cThis has been the most amazing week. We had so much support from our family and friends it is just incredible.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can't even begin to describe how I feel,\u201d said Gettys Brannon, a junior majoring in Advertising. \u201cThere were some great fishermen here this week; some really great guys. There is no other sport like this. You compete against these guys who have become your friends and are happy for whoever wins. College fishing is like a fraternity; sometimes you share information, but not enough. This truly is one of the most memorable moments of my life.\u201d\n\nThe University of South Carolina duo knew that consistency in the tournament was going to win the race and no other team in the tournament was as consistent as U.S.C. They brought 17 pounds, 6 ounces to the scale on day one, followed that up with an 18-11 stringer on day two and today claimed victory behind the strength of a 17-1 sack.\n\nThe team spent the week running to as many points as they could find following the blueback herring spawn. \u201cWe couldn't reel in our lines fast enough,\u201d said Walters. \u201cWe would cast, reel in and if nothing bit we moved to another point.\n\nWind was another key factor for the team this week. They said that if the wind wasn't blowing then the fish weren't biting.\n\n\u201cMy advice to you (fans) is to go out and buy as many bags of flukes as you can find,\u201d continued Brannon. \u201cI would suggest white, maybe some silver with a little shine\u2026maybe some chrome.\u201d\n\nThis is the first FLW College Fishing National Championship title for the University of South Carolina who will now advance to the 2015 Forrest Wood Cup to compete on Lake Ouachita in Hot Springs, Arkansas.\n\nThe top 10 teams ended competition in:\n\n1st: University of South Carolina \u2013 Patrick Walters, Summerville, S.C., and Gettys Brannon, Columbia, S.C.
