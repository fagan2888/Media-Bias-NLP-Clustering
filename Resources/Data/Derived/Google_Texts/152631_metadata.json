When Sioux Chieftain Chauncey Yellow Robe, a descendant of Sitting Bull, learned the President would be there, he suggested he be adopted into the tribe.\n\nThe Sioux County Pioneer, a weekly publication that came out every Thursday, reported that Yellow Robe had urged his people to extend to the President \u201ca united welcome and genuine western hospitality.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been asked \u2018What the Indians are thinking of President Coolidge\u2019s coming to the Black Hills,\u2019\u201d Yellow Robe reportedly said: \u201cThe Indians are like anybody else, they are also anxious to see him come. Our population of more than 20,000 Sioux Indians, the first people of the Hills, will also open their hearts with most sincere and hearty welcome of President Coolidge to the land of the Dakotas and if the occasion should permit, President Coolidge will be adopted into the Sioux tribe. We hope he will find in these beautiful Pahasapas (Black Hills) rest, peace, quiet and friendship among us.\u201d\n\nCoolidge, a Republican attorney from Vermont known by various nicknames including \u201cSilent Cal,\u201d served as vice president under President Warren Harding. When Harding died suddenly in 1923, Coolidge was sworn in and served the remainder of the term. He was elected in 1924 and served until 1929.\n\nDuring the summer of 1927, Coolidge and his wife, Grace, fled the bustle and humidity of Washington, D.C., said Rushad Thomas, program and editorial associate at the Calvin Coolidge Memorial Foundation. They arrived in Rapid City, South Dakota on June 13 and liked it so much they stayed for three months.\n\nThe Coolidges stayed at the Game Lodge in Custer State Park, and while the President worked or fished, Grace knitted on the lodge porch and enjoyed nature walks, states a 2011 article in South Dakota Magazine.\n\nTheir stay also coincided with the sculpting of Mount Rushmore. Coolidge, who participated in a widely publicized dedication ceremony in August of 1927\u2014two years after the project began\u2014later supported legislation to fund completion.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On June 23, 1927, the Sioux County Pioneer, a newspaper in North Dakota, reported that President Calvin Coolidge would be adopted by a Sioux Tribe.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "og": {"url": "http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2014/06/23/native-history-newspaper-reports-coolidge-be-adopted-sioux-tribe-155424", "site_name": "Indian Country Today Media Network.com", "image": "http://d1jrw5jterzxwu.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/article_media/calvin-coolidge-headdress.jpg", "type": "article", "title": "Native History: Pres.
