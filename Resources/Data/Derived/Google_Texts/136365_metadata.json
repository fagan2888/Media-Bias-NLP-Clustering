This is the first time the survey collected data on distance enrollment.\n\nFor-Profit at the Top\n\nBy far, private, for-profit institutions had the largest percentage of students taking all or part of their classes online.\n\nThis is especially true of students seeking four-year degrees at private, for-profit schools. The survey showed 61.3% of those students enrolled exclusively online. This compares to 11.9% of four-year students in private, nonprofit universities and 7.1% in public universities.\n\nBut the story was different for students seeking two-year degrees. While nearly 10% of students pursuing two-year degrees in public colleges took only online courses, it dropped to 5% at private, for-profit schools.\n\nIn all, enrollment for private, for-profit universities was about evenly split between students who attended only traditional brick-and-mortar classes and those who took at least some online courses. Slightly more than 1 million students took at least some classes online and 1.1 million, or 50.9%, took no online classes.\n\nGeographic Divisions\n\nColleges in New England had the lowest percentage of students who took online courses with 15.5% of about 1 million students taking some online classes. The Southwest had the highest percentage of online students. In that region, 36.5% of students took at least some online instruction.\n\nOne of the most striking findings is Arizona where nearly 65% of college students took some online classes. For students who took only online courses, Arizona easily saw the highest number at 360,835 and highest percentage at 48.2%. Only 265,000 college students in the state took no online classes at all.\n\nOnly six other states in the fall of 2012 had a higher total college enrollment than Arizona, despite the state ranking 16th in population.\n\nRhode Island showed the lowest percentage of students taking online courses at 11.7%.\n\n\u00ad\u00adThese are the top five states in total college enrollment and the percentage of students taking only online classes:\n\nCalifornia: 2.7 million students, 6.3% exclusively online\n\nTexas: 1.6 million students, 8.9% exclusively online\n\nNew York: 1.35 million students, 6.1% exclusively online\n\nFlorida: 1.2 million students, 16.1% exclusively online\n\nIllinois: 888,000 students, 10.1% exclusively online\n\nThe survey also showed 20,014 undergraduate students outside the United States took exclusively online courses at American universities and 13,549 graduate students outside the country were taking online classes in the fall of 2012.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education said it intends to use this first survey that includes online higher education as a baseline for subsequent studies.\n\nGet Free Updates!
