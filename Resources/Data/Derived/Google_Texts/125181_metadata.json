Yet party orthodoxy and GOP primary politics require them to propose to undo President Obama\u2019s redistributive policies \u2014 chief among them the Affordable Care Act \u2014 and to support a less progressive tax structure than Obama and Democrats do.\n\nHow Republicans reconcile these two things \u2014 the need to offer solutions to inequality while vowing to roll back Obama\u2019s efforts to redistribute resources downward \u2014 will be a key dynamic to watch.\n\nHere\u2019s an early indication of the problem Republicans may face in this regard. Note this exchange between CNBC\u2019s John Harwood and Scott Walker, in which Harwood argues that Walker\u2019s Obamacare replacement would reverse the ACA\u2019s downward redistribution:\n\nHARWOOD: Obamacare redistributed money from high income taxpayers, from healthy people, from younger people, to people who had less money, who were older and sicker. Your repeal would redistribute that money in the other direction. Given the trends of income disparity in the country, why is this the right time for that kind of redistribution? WALKER: Our system\u2019s purely about freedom. It\u2019s about giving people the freedom. The tax credit goes up by age, not by income. It goes up by age because the credit should be connected to what it actually costs people to get health insurance. It\u2019s not about a redistribution of wealth issue. We allow people to buy into whatever \u2014 give \u2019em the freedom. We give patients as consumers the freedom to choose where they want to go or \u2014 frankly, part of our plan says if you want to pool together your resources as consumers, and pick your own plan, you can do that on your own. You have the freedom to take this tax credit, to take your money and pick where you want to go \u2014 or if you want to have health care at all. We don\u2019t have a mandate. We wiped the mandate out. We say you can control your own money, with money for a health savings account. Whether you have your own health care plan through your employer or you buy one individually, it\u2019s all about freedom.\n\nNote that Walker doesn\u2019t deny Harwood\u2019s suggestion that his plan would redistribute resources upwards. He says his plan isn\u2019t about accomplishing this species of redistribution, without addressing whether his plan would do that. (See Jonathan Chait\u2019s piece for the details on why his plan actually would do that.) Walker\u2019s answer is that relaxing Obamacare\u2019s regulations \u2014 which he repeatedly describes as \u201cfreedom\u201d \u2014 is a worthy end in itself. In this interview Walker doesn\u2019t take this argument to the next logical step, i.e. that restoring this freedom will ultimately lead to lower costs by unshackling the free market, even though he very well may believe it to be true.\n\nMost of the GOP candidates seem to agree that one of the primary obstacles to combating inequality and restoring economic opportunity and mobility \u2014 which they agree is a central challenge we face \u2014 is that there is too much government-engineered downward redistribution of wealth. To be fair, it\u2019s still early, and we still don\u2019t know what their overall agendas will look like. But what we have seen so far does point in this direction.\n\nJeb Bush tacitly premised his big economic speech on the idea that the primary driver of inequality is dependence on the federal government. Marco Rubio\u2019s tax plan could result in a hugely regressive tax cut, which he says would unshackle investment that helps employ bartenders like his father. Many of the candidates have flirted with the idea of a flat (i.e., less progressive) tax. The GOP\u2019s primary economic vision \u2014 to which the GOP candidates will probably pledge fealty to sooner or later \u2014 continues to be shaped around the Paul Ryan vision, which would impose its cuts disproportionately on programs for people of lower incomes. The repeal of Obamacare \u2014 which all the candidates have vowed \u2014 would undo or reverse its redistributive effects.\n\nObviously it\u2019s possible to genuinely believe that reversing Obama\u2019s redistributive policies is the right thing to do, because downward redistribution is unfair or traps people in dependency, or because it ultimately does more economic harm than good, or because regulations that restrict economic freedom are inherently wrong and/or not worth the trade-off. Some Republicans would probably argue that undoing these policies doesn\u2019t really count as upward redistribution and is more a matter of restoring some sort of natural outcome that Obama\u2019s policies distorted. But that might be a tough case to make politically, particularly if Republicans are questioned directly on whether their policies would redistribute resources upwards and on why that\u2019s defensible, as Harwood has done to Walker here.\n\n********************************************************************\n\n* SANDERS ORGANIZING UP A STORM IN IOWA: The New York Times\u2019 Jason Horowitz has a useful look at Bernie Sanders\u2019 surge in Iowa, which is driven in part by voters who say he makes them feel like they \u201cbelong\u201d to something big, and in part by his campaign\u2019s brute organizing:\n\nIt now has 53 people on staff, with a \u201crobust hiring plan\u201d made possible by Mr. Sanders\u2019s fund-raising success with small donors, according to his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver. This past weekend alone, he said, the campaign\u2019s 1,700 volunteers marched out of 15 campaign offices throughout the state to knock on 17,000 doors and make 10,000 phone calls. They call it Bern-Storming.\n\n\n\nThe question is whether Sanders\u2019 support is confined mostly to white progressives, allowing him to compete in Iowa and New Hampshire, and is not demographically broad enough (as is Hillary Clinton\u2019s) to compete among Dems nationally.\n\n* WHAT TO WATCH TODAY: At 2 PM, Senator Chris Coons of Delaware will announce his position on the Iran deal. He is one of the remaining genuinely undecided Democrats, so his decision may help us get a sense of whether supporters of the deal will be able to keep the votes against it below 60, thus avoiding a veto-override fight.\n\n* IRAN DEAL GAINS MOMENTUM: Four more House Democrats have now come out and endorsed the Iran deal, and crucially, they are all from New York or Florida, where opposition to the deal was thought to be concentrated. Some had expected New York Dems to come out in droves against it after Chuck Schumer did, but that isn\u2019t happening.\n\nReminder: If Obama\u2019s veto of a GOP resolution disapproving of the deal is not over-ridden in the House, as seems increasingly likely, it\u2019s over \u2014 there is no need for a veto override vote in the Senate, which proponents would very much like to avoid.\n\n* SHARP PARTISAN DIVIDE OVER IRAN AGREEMENT: Though some polls have found Americans oppose the Iran deal, the Post\u2019s Scott Clement reports on a new national poll showing American tilt narrowly towards it, by 52-47. Note this:\n\nDemocrats and Republicans are polar opposites in their view of the accord\u2026.Nearly 7 in 10 Democrats support the deal. An identical share of Republicans are opposed. Among independents, 6 in 10 express support.\n\nThis is probably the result of Obama spending so much time publicly selling it.\n\n* EXPLAINING DONALD TRUMP\u2019S RISE: Bloomberg\u2019s John McCormick takes a close look at new Iowa polling and concludes that Trump\u2019s surge in the state is because \u201che\u2019s been able to sell himself as the straight-talker most candidates aspire to be,\u201d with a large chunk of Iowa Republicans believing he \u201ctells it like it is.\u201d\n\nOf course, claiming you will deport 11 million and replace Obamacare with \u201csomething terrific\u201d isn\u2019t \u201cstraight talk\u201d or \u201ctelling it like it is.\u201d Maybe the \u201cstraight talk\u201d these voters think they\u2019re hearing is Trump\u2019s prolific insulting of immigrants?\n\n* HOW DONALD TRUMP\u2019S DEMAGOGUERY WORKS: Michael Gerson gets to the heart of how Trump\u2019s populism really works:\n\nThe country \u2014 betrayed by elites, beset by foreigners, exploited and humiliated at every turn \u2014 needs more than policy papers. It needs a savior. Populism is not identical to demagoguery, but it attracts demagogues\u2026.Trump\u2019s political approach is defined by the fomenting of conflict with foreigners: with scheming Mexicans and predatory Chinese. Remove the appeal to base instincts and you are left with little but opposition to entitlement reform.\n\nYour regular reminder: Multiple national polls have shown that large percentages of Republicans agree with his specific views on immigration. Maybe that helps explain his appeal.\n\n* QUOTE OF THE DAY, TRUMP-HAS-UNMASKED-THE-REAL-GOP EDITION: The Hill has a good piece explaining how Trump\u2019s positions have forced a genuine GOP immigration debate.
