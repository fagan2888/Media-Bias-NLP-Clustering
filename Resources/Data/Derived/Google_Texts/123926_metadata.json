Edited excerpts:\n\nDavid Prokupek runs Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc. Jackson Hewitt\n\nQ.: How do I switch industries?\n\nFigure out what your value-add is in the thing you\u2019re doing and go pitch that to the next industry. So if you\u2019ve been really good at sales in telecom and now you want to go do media, pitch the fact that you can open doors that others can\u2019t, or whatever they happen to be looking for \u2014 that is always a good way to switch.\n\nThe other way to switch is to figure out a problem that one industry is having and come at it another way. Then say [to companies in that sector] \u2018I know how to solve that problem.\u2019\n\nThe third way is just network. Most jobs come from your network of friends and letting people know that you\u2019re interested in switching and being willing to take something that may be slightly below what you were doing [before.] If you really want to do it, get yourself in, because a strong performer will move up really quickly.\n\nI\u2019ve switched more than most. I\u2019ve been in consumer, financial services, tax. I started as a copier salesman at IBM. That was my first job in college. I wanted to work on Wall Street. I just called a couple CEOs and said, \u2018I\u2019m really good at sales and I don\u2019t want to keep taking the paper out of the copier anymore.\u2019 I kept working my network and I went from selling copiers to working on Wall Street selling stocks.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "A former burger-chain CEO who now runs a tax-preparation company has some advice on how to change industries.", "title": "What it Takes to Switch Careers", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2015/01/09/what-it-takes-to-switch-careers/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GH382_0106ja_P_20150106150502.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Careers", "article.headline": "What it Takes to Switch Careers", "description": "A former burger-chain CEO who now runs a tax-preparation company has some advice on how to change industries.", "article_section": "Careers", "author": "Rachel Feintzeig", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "At Work Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "At Work", "article.summary": "A former burger-chain CEO who now runs a tax-preparation company has some advice on how to change industries.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-01-09T14:00:33-05:00", "dj.asn": "10-141", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2015/01/09/what-it-takes-to-switch-careers/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-ATWORKB-2233", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Careers", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "A former burger-chain CEO who now runs a tax-preparation company has some advice on how to change industries.", "title": "What it Takes to Switch Careers", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2015/01/09/what-it-takes-to-switch-careers/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-GH382_0106ja_P_20150106150502.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "At Work", "article.id": "BL-ATWORKB-2233", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-01-08T22:56:51-05:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4016\"", "article_summary": "Edited excerpts:David Prokupek runs Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc.
