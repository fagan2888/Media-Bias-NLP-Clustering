A shooting instructor was accidentally shot and killed while showing a 9-year-old girl how to use an automatic Uzi. Mohave County sheriffâ€™s officials say the instructor, Charles Vacca, 39, was standing next to the girl on Monday when she pulled the trigger and the recoil sent the gun over her head at Last Stop shooting range in White Hills.
