Strangely, the Republican party has yet to rally around any substantial plan to replace it. The ACA\u2019s detractors claim that premiums have skyrocketed since its inception. But according to nonpartisan website Politifact, premiums have \u201crisen by about 5.8 percent a year since Obama took office, compared to 13.2 percent in the nine years before Obama.\u201d\n\nThis far-reaching change in the healthcare system has affected Americans differently based on geography, income level, and family size, but to call it a \u201cdisaster,\u201d in the words of Donald Trump, is disingenuous at best. In fact, as of 2016, 20 million adults have gained health insurance because of the ACA. Millions of these Americans had previously attempted to purchase insurance but were denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions. To set politics aside and look at the human side of the issue, there are countless seldom-told stories of people whose lives have been saved thanks to the ACA. That\u2019s why a letter to President Obama from a lifelong Republican who owes a debt of gratitude to the ACA is so meaningful.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "'You saved my life.'", "og": {"site_name": "GOOD Magazine", "description": "'You saved my life.'", "title": "Why a Die-Hard Republican Wrote This Heartfelt Apology to Obama", "url": "https://www.good.is/articles/lifelong-gop-likes-aca", "image": "https://assets.goodstatic.com/s3/magazine/assets/556216/original/Obama1.jpg=s1200x1200", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "'You saved my life.'", "title": "Why a Die-Hard Republican Wrote This Heartfelt Apology to Obama", "url": "https://www.good.is/articles/lifelong-gop-likes-aca", "image": "https://assets.goodstatic.com/s3/magazine/assets/556216/original/Obama1.jpg=s1200x1200", "site": "@good", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#009cff", "robots": "noodp, noydir", "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "csrf-token": "AcO6G9cR6sAfuf6IcHyugyXhRbTwp7Sz0ikDQR5+VYhTIVIwvq33Q1PG6YFk/J1XCj7vWyIk5N5lLmFmq4BT8A==", "fb": {"admins": 100004372031382, "app_id": 590727534352624, "pages": 13152108058}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/GOODHQ", "section": "The GOOD Life", "tag": "living well", "published_time": "2016-03-05T09:35:00Z", "modified_time": "2016-03-07T11:10:49Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, minimal-ui"}, "article_summary": "That\u2019s why a letter to President Obama from a lifelong Republican who owes a debt of gratitude to the ACA is so meaningful.\nIn fact, as of 2016, 20 million adults have gained health insurance because of the ACA.\nWhen the GOP candidates take a breather from their petty debate arguments, they love stating that they\u2019ll \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.\nMillions of these Americans had previously attempted to purchase insurance but were denied coverage because of pre-existing conditions.\nStrangely, the Republican party has yet to rally around any substantial plan to replace it."}
