She was fortunate to have the opportunity to serve as a White House Intern while she was in college. While Elizabeth currently resides in central Pennsylvania, her heart never left the political scene in Washington, D.C.\n\nElizabeth Greenaway is a marketing and communications strategist by day and a political enthusiast by night. In her career, she works with clients to create, analyze and evaluate communication plans; and writes a variety of content to promote brands and their products through traditional and digital media. She recently decided to combine her passions and began writing content to promote the political ideology she believes in.\n\nWhen you\u2019ve got a heart for politics like I do, and you live in Pennsylvania, presidential election years are rough.\n\nThose of you who know Pennsylvania politics know we rarely have a chance to make an impact in primary voting. Usually by the end of April, the votes are already leaning heavily one way, and while we still have the opportunity to pledge our vote, the reality is, it doesn\u2019t count for much.\n\nThis year, it\u2019s different.\n\nConservatives in Pennsylvania have the ability to make a significant impact, and this weekend, I found our guy \u2013 his name is Ted Cruz. Pennsylvania Donald Trumpsters \u2013 hear me out; you and I have more in common than you may think.\n\nLet me start by sharing with you that I have lived in the small-town Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for 24 of 29 years of my life. I know how important the Constitution is to me and my fellow conservative Pennsylvanians. We were, after all, previously known by President Barack Obama as the bitter Christians, clinging to our guns and religion. I would argue \u201cpassionate,\u201d or \u201cangry,\u201d might be better descriptions, but nevertheless, years later Obama hasn\u2019t restored any of the missing jobs in Pennsylvania, and many of us are still angry.\n\nAnd yes, we\u2019re all still clinging to our guns and religion. In Pennsylvania, we enjoy our Second Amendment rights. Regardless of what gun, or which religion you cling to, I\u2019m willing to bet that you and I notice some of the same problems in Pennsylvania, and are frustrated and angry with Obama, his entire administration, and Congress.\n\nTrumpsters, I know this speaks to you! I am just as fed up as you are and there are few things I enjoy more than Trump\u2019s complete neglect for political correctness. I get it. Really I do.\n\nI\u2019m just wondering why Trump didn\u2019t come to visit us at the Pennsylvania Leadership Conference, and why he skipped out on the Conservative Political Action Conference. I\u2019m wondering why he\u2019s given so much money to so many Democrats. Democrats who used Trump\u2019s support to get the political atmosphere where it is today \u2013 and isn\u2019t that an ugly place?\n\nAs a true conservative, these things should concern you, too.\n\nIf you know me, you know I appreciate blunt honesty; but it\u2019s empty without action behind it. The primary candidate we choose has to know the policies to be able to develop solutions to fix them.\n\nAt the Pennsylvania Leadership Conference this weekend, Ted Cruz looked me and hundreds of fellow Pennsylvanians in the eye and explained how he\u2019s going to help us solve the issues we\u2019re dealing with. For the Trumpsters in the audience \u2013 give me a chance to explain.\n\nAs a Pennsylvanian, you may find yourself juggling two jobs, or trying to make up for reduced hours as a result of Obamacare kicking in at 30 hours per week. You might be struggling to pay the bills, as you work in a job where the wages have completely gone stagnant, and the cost of living continues to rise. You could be a small business owner struggling to afford Obamacare and maintain the same number of full-time employees. Or maybe, just maybe, you graduated from college in the past few years, and find yourself living with your parents and struggling to find a job.\n\nThe media tells us this is just how the job market is, but don\u2019t you think there\u2019s room for improvement? We can all agree making America great again is the answer \u2013 the question is who can get us there?\n\nThe answer is Ted Cruz. Here\u2019s how:\n\nWe have the opportunity to make an impact for a Texan who holds his guns and religion just as close as we do. A passionate, spirited, freedom fighter, who as a teenager memorized the Constitution \u2013 and has spent the past three years defending it relentlessly in the Senate. The man Rush Limbaugh says \u201cis the closest in our lifetimes we have ever been to Ronald Reagan.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, April 26, I hope you\u2019ll join me, fellow Pennsylvanians, in supporting Ted Cruz, a Texan who has our back.\n\nAs a 20-something female, I am the voice of the future conservative movement. There may not be many millennial conservatives, but we\u2019re here, and we\u2019re passionate about the future.\n\n\u2013\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.
