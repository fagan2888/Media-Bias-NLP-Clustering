Galesburg teachers roll out the red carpet for students at Nielson School on Thursday.

They're also making a balloon arch for big entrance for the first day of classes.

It's quite a contrast from a year ago.

While teachers got high-fives during a 15-day strike, they're happy to return the favor for kids this year.

"For me, it was a period of time that I hope never, ever happens again," said Jodie McNally, an 11-year teacher and outreach coordinator at Nielson School.

Reasons why McNally and her colleagues offer a big welcome.

Just before classes start, kids walk the red carpet in style.

"They say you have to make the first day the greatest day, so that kids want to come back the next day," she continued.

During the strike, chants replace any celebration.

But that's all in the past for moms like Amy Okrzesik.

"It all worked out for the kids," she said. "It's definitely different this year."

This celebration sets the tone after a year of challenges. It's a fresh start for kids and Galesburg schools.

"It was tough," McNally recalled.

A strike divides a community and strains relationships. But this August, there's a revival of energy and enthusiasm.

"This is what it's supposed to be when you become a teacher," she said. "You think of these faces."

Moms like Brandi Bridgewater feel the spirit.

"The kids are really excited," she said.

"We came out of a really bad situation," McNally concluded. "And I think we're stronger for it."

They'll be staying Nielson Strong for 2015 and years to come.
