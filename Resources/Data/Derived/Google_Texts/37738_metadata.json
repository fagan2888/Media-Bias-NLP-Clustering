The show did see some steep competition. Sunday night has become THE night for prestige TV, and last night the show faced off against \"Veep,\" \"Cosmos,\" \"The Good Wife\" and \"Game of Thrones.\" The latter two might have been the biggest draws. In recent years, \"Thrones\" has displaced \"Mad Men\" as the show to talk about, and \"Good Wife\" was still working through the fallout of the shocking (spoilers for weeks old television?) death of one of its leads, Josh Charles' Will Gardner.\n\nThe show technically has one more season premiere, since the final season has been split into two halves, with the second half not appearing until 2015. Maybe that not-a-season-premiere will be a bigger draw, since it will be the actual final first episode, even if Matthew Weiner and company are calling it the same season as this one.\n\nCome on, guys, we need to keep watching to see if Peggy becomes Don's boss!", "article_metadata": {"description": "'Mad Men': Have viewers lost interest?", "author": "Lisa Weidenfeld", "og": {"site_name": "Metro", "description": "'Mad Men': Have viewers lost interest?", "title": "'Mad Men': Have viewers lost interest?", "url": "http://www.metro.us/entertainment/mad-men-have-viewers-lost-interest/tmWndn---cbEmULKJR0GLI/", "image": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$j376hlc9l9x224c5dpxg6delic03fvw/WEKTV_MADMEN_0321.jpeg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "metro.us", "description": "'Mad Men': Have viewers lost interest?", "creator": "Lisa Weidenfeld", "image": {"src": "http://www.metro.us/_internal/gxml!0/4dntvuhh2yeo4npyb3igdet73odaolf$j376hlc9l9x224c5dpxg6delic03fvw/WEKTV_MADMEN_0321.jpeg"}, "title": "'Mad Men': Have viewers lost interest?", "site": "@Metro_US", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msvalidate.01": "9F42CC1BA36D4325E006BBA620C3B678", "robots": "index,follow,noodp,noydir", "mediatype": "Article", "keywords": "Television,Region National,Mad-Men,Cosmos, Game of Thrones, good wife, josh charles, Mad Men, mad men premiere, Matthew Weiner, Veep", "fb": {"app_id": 1610587402522117, "pages": 146825895340972}, "date": "2014-10-10", "article": {"contentgroup": "Article Automatic,US Legacy Import Automatic", "section": "/entertainment/television", "published_time": "2014-04-14T18:32:33Z", "modified_time": "2014-04-14T18:32:33Z"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Television,Region National,Mad-Men,Cosmos, Game of Thrones, good wife, josh charles, Mad Men, mad men premiere, Matthew Weiner, Veep"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdac4e\"", "article_summary": "/ Carin Baer/AMC\"Mad Men\" had its lowest season premiere numbers since 2008 as it began its much ballyhooed final season.\nThe show technically has one more season premiere, since the final season has been split into two halves, with the second half not appearing until 2015.\nAre viewers experiencing \"Mad Men\" fatigue?\n2.3 million people tuned in to see what Don Draper and the gang are up to, which is down 32% in total viewers from the 2013 season premiere.\nSunday night has become THE night for prestige TV, and last night the show faced off against \"Veep,\" \"Cosmos,\" \"The Good Wife\" and \"Game of Thrones.\""}
