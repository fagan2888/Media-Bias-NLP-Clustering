Obama is by no means beloved. Nor are his policies when clearly identified as being Obama policies.\n\nAs the response to the tax question suggests, it's the messenger, not the message.\n\nThe results, released Thursday, are the third part in a series of data the respected independent pollsters have shared this week. In Ohio, Quinnipiac surveyed 943 voters from Jan. 22 through Feb. 1. Among the key findings here:\n\n42 percent approve of Obama's job performance; 53 percent disapprove.\n\n38 percent believe Obama's policies have helped the nation's economy, 40 percent believe his policies have hurt and 19 percent see no difference.\n\n55 percent oppose Obama's Affordable Care Act, but only 27 percent believe Congress should repeal the program entirely. Most favor minor or major changes. Eleven percent favor keeping the law.\n\n51 percent oppose Obama's plan to provide free community college tuition.\n\n61 percent responded that they would like to see the next president \"generally\" change direction from Obama's policies.\n\n61 percent support \"increasing taxes on high income earners to reduce the amount of taxes paid by the middle class.\" Unlike on other questions, this proposal was not described as being a policy that Obama favors.\n\nIn other areas, a majority of Ohioans are \"very worried\" or \"somewhat worried\" about Islamic extremism and about a possible terrorist attack in the U.S.\n\nIn Ohio, the poll has a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points.\n\nYou can see full results from Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida here.\n\nOther Quinnipiac Ohio surveys this week:\n\nHillary Clinton would run the table in Ohio -- except in a race with John Kasich.\n\nRepublican presidential race is wide open, but Kasich is a big factor in Ohio.", "article_metadata": {"article_author": "Henry J.
