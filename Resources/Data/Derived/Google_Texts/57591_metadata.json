On Saturday, they finally did with a 7-5 win over the Broomfield-based Thunder Academy.\n\n\"It feels good, it feels really good,\" said Simmons, the Erie head coach, who got a strong performance on the mound from his very own Caleb Crites. \"We have been here for the past four or five years with this group and typically with an older group than this.\n\nLongmont/Erie catcher Nic Ogimachi gets the tag on Thunder Academy's Javis Larson during the quarterfinals of the Boulder NIT (Cliff Grassmick / Daily Camera)\n\n\"So to get over the hump and do it with a younger team is really nice and is good for these guys.\"\n\nAfter jumping out to a 1-0 lead in the top of the first thanks to a two-out rally and an RBI double from Miguel Moroyoqui, the Trogers \u2014 as in the Trojans and Tigers \u2014 got a big boost with a defensive gem in the bottom half.\n\nIt was again Moroyoqui who fielded a base hit from Thunder Academy's Kyle Leahy (ironically, an Erie player) and came up firing to catcher Nic Ogimachi to nail Javis Larson at the plate.\n\n\"I saw the runner coming home so I didn't have (first baseman Ryan Rulon) catch it,\" Ogimachi said. \"I caught and turned to try and get something and got him on the leg. That felt good.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLongmont/Erie was up 2-1 in the fourth when Ogimachi transferred his good feelings defensively to the offensive side. With Avery Peterson on second base after a leadoff single and wild pitch, Ogimachi squared up a letter-high 1-2 pitch from Patrick Kline and drove it well over the left-center field wall.\n\n\"I just kind of sat back with the curve and he threw it,\" Ogimachi said. \"And when I hit it I thought maybe it's going, maybe not.\"\n\nThe Trogers got a fortunate break in the fifth, manufacturing a run with a well-timed double steal that allowed Cooper Rothe to come home. Ogimachi made it 6-1 when he drove in Zane Begano to cap his 3 for 4 game with his third run batted in.\n\nIt was all the offense Caleb Crites would need. The Erie starter gave up eight hits and five runs, but never allowed Thunder Academy to string anything together. He got out of a bases loaded jam in the bottom of the sixth inning, getting Fairview's Tobiah Armstrong to ground out to second base.\n\n\"The defense totally backed me up,\" Crites said. \"I could not have done it without them, they made some extraordinary plays.\"\n\nEarlier Saturday, 5280 Victorium and Slammers North advanced to Sunday's semifinals, which will be played at 9 a.m. and noon with the championship to follow at 3 p.m. at Scott Carpenter.\n\nFollow Jon on Twitter: twitter.com/JonEYunt\n\nLongmont/Erie 7, Thunder Academy 5\n\nAt Scott Carpenter Park\n\nLongmont/Erie 112 200 1 \u2014 7 9 0\n\nThunder Academy 100 201 1 \u2014 5 8 2\n\nW \u2014 C.
