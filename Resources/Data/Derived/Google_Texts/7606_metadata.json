(4:30 p.m. MT, ESPNU).\n\nThe winner will advance to Sunday\u2019s regional final, to face either top-seeded St. Cloud State (31-8-1) or No. 4 Ferris State (19-14-6).\n\nThe regional winner will advance to the April 7-9 NCAA Frozen Four in Tampa, Fla.\n\nDenver is coming off a 0-1-1 showing at the National Collegiate Hockey Conference tournament finals in Minneapolis. The Pioneers lost to St. Cloud 4-2 in Friday\u2019s semifinals before tying North Dakota 1-1 in Saturday\u2019s consolation game. Montgomery scratched a handful of regulars Saturday because the game was relatively meaningless, as the Pioneers were likely to secure a No. 2 seed.\n\nThe DU-BU game will be a rematch of an Oct. 31 regular season game in Boston, where the Terriers won 5-4 in overtime.\n\nBU hasn\u2019t played since March 12, when it lost 5-0 at Massachusetts-Lowell, and got swept out of the Hockey East playoffs.\n\nThe Terriers, who tied UMass-Lowell for fourth in the regular season, lost the series opener 3-2.\n\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver Pioneers hockey gets No. 2 seed in NCAA Tournament", "title": "Denver Pioneers hockey gets No. 2 seed in NCAA Tournament", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/20/denver-pioneers-hockey-gets-no-2-seed-in-ncaa-tournament/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160320__DU_Pioneersp1.jpg", "height": 439}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160320__DU_Pioneersp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-03-20T11:44:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-15T00:57:50+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "NCAA hockey, University of Denver"}, "article_summary": "Coach Jim Montgomery and his University of Denver Pioneers were in flight from Minnesota to Denver on Sunday when the 16-team NCAA Tournament were announced.\nThe Pioneers lost to St.\nThe regional winner will advance to the April 7-9 NCAA Frozen Four in Tampa, Fla.Denver is coming off a 0-1-1 showing at the National Collegiate Hockey Conference tournament finals in Minneapolis.\nMontgomery scratched a handful of regulars Saturday because the game was relatively meaningless, as the Pioneers were likely to secure a No.\nBU hasn\u2019t played since March 12, when it lost 5-0 at Massachusetts-Lowell, and got swept out of the Hockey East playoffs."}
