The age-old impulse to partition the Golden State took a new direction, thanks to a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, who has won approval to collect signatures for his new ballot measure, which has precisely zero chance of ultimately succeeding. Instead of two states, Tim Draper wants a half-dozen out of California:\n\nA plan to divide California into six separate US states is closer to making it on to a November ballot, with organizers gaining approval to collect signatures. The seemingly far-fetched initiative, sponsored by Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tim Draper, claims \u201cpolitical representation of California\u2019s diverse population and economies has rendered the state nearly ungovernable.\u201d And on Tuesday, the California Secretary of State\u2019s office gave the movement a boost, saying that proponents \u201cmay begin collecting petition signatures.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019ll need over 800,000 signatures before mid-July to make the ballot, but that\u2019s not going to be the big hurdle. Neither will the election, although it\u2019s doubtful it will get that far, because Californians aren\u2019t going to vote to dismember the state. And even if they did, Congress is not going to add 10 more Senate seats for Californians to hold.\n\nSo yes, this is a pipe dream at best. But it does raise some interesting questions about California, because Draper\u2019s certainly correct that the state has chronically incompetent governance. Instead of dismembering California, though, maybe voters should stop electing Democrats to state offices and overwhelming Democratic majorities to the legislature, as they have for decades (especially the legislature). No one was complaining about the state being \u201cungovernable\u201d when Republicans won statewide offices, and when Ronald Reagan was governor.\n\nRecently in the Green Room:", "article_metadata": {"description": "Is California \u201cungovernable\u201d after 40 years of Democratic domination?", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Greenroom", "description": "Well, maybe, although there\u2019s a solution for it that\u2019s slightly less extreme than splitting California into six new states.
