Both eateries are on East Montague Avenue in Park Circle.\n\nWhen North Charleston residents Rachael and Todd Parker were buying their home two years ago, their top priority was the real estate agent\u2019s mantra: location, location, location.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to be able to park our cars after work and enjoy our evenings and weekends where we lived,\u201d Rachael Parker said.\n\nThey settled in the East Park Circle area of North Charleston, near the Olde Village, a portion of the East Montague area that stretches from Park Circle to Virginia Avenue.\n\n\u201cWe love to walk around Park Circle and to restaurants in the Olde Village,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is always so much going on around here.\u201d\n\nLocation was also the most important factor for Spencer and John Allsop when they were home shopping in 2012.\n\nThey wanted to be close to work and shopping, but also wanted amenities like a neighborhood pool and walking trails, so they chose another North Charleston neighborhood 15 miles from the Parkers, Wescott Plantation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a growing area and we really like it,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the suburban life, where we have to drive to just about everything. Sometimes I do wish we had a quaint little downtown area.\u201d\n\nNorth Charleston is South Carolina\u2019s third-largest city with a population of 104,000. It spreads across 76 square miles, much of it in Charleston County, but also takes in part of Dorchester County and reaches into Berkeley County.\n\nEven though it\u2019s lacking a recognized downtown or access to fresh food in some areas, and saddled with some of the worst violent crime in the tri-county, new residents are showing up. Officials say neighborhoods in the city\u2019s troubled South End have been losing population but others, in Dorchester County and in the Park Circle area, are gaining residents. It encompasses nearly 10 times more area than its original size in just over 40 years.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have and never have had a downtown,\u201d said Mayor Keith Summey. \u201cThe little village we have is the only downtown we know.\u201d\n\nQuick growth\n\nOlde North Charleston was part of the original city in 1972, when after several failed attempts to incorporate, John Bourne, who became the city\u2019s first mayor, reduced the size of the area voting to four precincts most interested in incorporation. North Charleston had seven square miles and 21,000 residents.\n\nThe city\u2019s founders immediately started annexing surrounding areas, and within a year the population was 53,000, according to city records.\n\nBourne, who served as mayor for nearly 20 years, said city leaders thought the commercial area around the North Charleston Coliseum would grow into a downtown.\n\nCity planners envisioned shops and restaurants with apartments above them, and buildings that went right up to the sidewalks \u2014 an urban, pedestrian-friendly city center.\n\nWhile the area never became a traditional downtown, Bourne said, it is thriving.\n\nHe also said Park Circle serves as a small downtown area, even though it comprises only a few blocks.\n\nOverall, he said, he\u2019s amazed at the way North Charleston has grown up. \u201cIt has grown more than I had envisioned,\u201d he said.\n\nThe municipality touts attractions such as the North Charleston Coliseum and Performing Arts Center, the Golf Club at Wescott Plantation off Dorchester Road and Riverfront Park on the old Navy base.\n\nAnd while some residents might wish for a downtown, city leaders are not so sure it\u2019s necessary.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it matters,\u201d said Councilman Ron Brinson. \u201cWhere\u2019s Mount Pleasant\u2019s downtown? There are many cities that you would have trouble identifying a downtown, or if they have one, it\u2019s kind of ill-defined.\u201d\n\nIn the early 20th century, about 50 years before North Charleston became a city, the area was laid out with Park Circle as a central green space with streets radiating out for residential, commercial and industrial use.\n\nOne of those streets is East Montague Avenue, where the Olde Village area now offers restaurants with outdoor dining, businesses, churches and North Charleston High School between Park Circle and Virginia Avenue.\n\n\u201cWe get comments about it every now and then, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, we do have a downtown area,\u201d said Councilman Bob King, whose district includes the Olde Village area. \u201cSome of the other areas are really growing, too, no doubt about it, but this is where North Charleston began.\u201d\n\nThe area has been revitalized in the last couple of decades and is now the center of many of the city\u2019s cultural activities and festivities, including the city\u2019s Arts Festival, St. Patrick\u2019s Day celebration, Christmas parade and music events throughout the year.\n\n\u201cA few years ago, we got some businesses to come in there and new restaurants,\u201d he said. \u201cWe found that a lot of people wanted to come to that area to live. A lot of people want to live in a nice home and go down to the village for dinner. That\u2019s what they like.\u201d\n\nPersistent problems\n\nWhat they are missing in the old part of the city is a grocery store. Summey says he has worked for years to bring one to the area, which has been classified as a food desert.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the one thing we are missing,\u201d said Terri Hamilton of Mixson Avenue. \u201cI usually drive to West Ashley to buy food once a week.\u201d\n\nNorth Charleston has 19 grocery stores over 10,000 square feet in size, according to the city. By comparison, Mount Pleasant, a city of 75,000, has more than 30, some within sight of each other.\n\nAs far as livability goes, the lack of a downtown is probably low on North Charleston\u2019s priority list. The city garnered national attention last month when one of its police officers fatally shot Walter Scott. Scott was pulled over April 4 on Remount Road by North Charleston Patrolman 1st Class Michael Slager, and video footage from a bystander\u2019s cellphone showed that Slager shot at Scott eight times as he ran from the traffic stop. Slager is charged with murder.\n\nThe case illustrates how officials are battling the city\u2019s image as a violent place to live \u2014 even though the reaction to Scott\u2019s death was nowhere near as violent as protests over officer-involved deaths in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore.\n\nThe city\u2019s murder rate was about triple the national average in 2013, the latest year for which national statistics were available.\n\nNorth Charleston also led the tri-county in homicides three years after posting its lowest murder rate in decades, an achievement that had been partially attributed to aggressive policing. Its police force investigated 22 killings in 2014, up from 16 deaths in 2013, 13 in 2012 and five in 2011. The city of Charleston recorded 9 homicides in 2013, according to data collected by The Post and Courier.\n\nCity officials insist, however, that the city is safe and thriving, and that most of the crime is committed by a small segment of the population who live in a few areas.\n\nWhen protesters wanted to draw attention to the lack of a civilian oversight board in North Charleston, the most effective protest wasn\u2019t even in the city. A group used cars and walkers to stop traffic at rush hour on the Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge, which connects Charleston and Mount Pleasant, on the one-month anniversary of Scott\u2019s slaying. That 15-minute-long protest received days of news coverage.\n\nNational Action Network leader Thomas Dixon said his group\u2019s demonstrations at North Charleston City Hall on Mall Drive immediately after Slager\u2019s arrest were effective. The events were sparsely attended, often gathering only a few dozen people, but they were near the national TV news trucks.\n\n\u201cThe issue in that scenario was City Hall,\u201d he said, and that a downtown destination wouldn\u2019t have mattered.\n\nChanging perceptions\n\nUntil large-scale shopping centers and urban sprawl became popular in the 1960s and \u201970s, Main Streets were the center of commercial, social and civic activities in many municipalities, according to the National Main Street Center, a program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. They were the heart of a community.\n\nNow, communities are revitalizing their main streets to return to a traditional small-town environment.\n\nAcross the country many municipalities, such as Greenville and Columbia, have put millions of dollars and years of work into giving new life to their historic downtowns.\n\nThe city of Greenville has been particularly committed, planting trees and widening its Main Street sidewalks in the 1980s and creating Falls Park along the Reedy River a decade ago \u2014 two measures that spurred new investment and changed the image of its downtown. Columbia has improved Gervais Street in its Congaree Vista District, also luring new restaurants and shops.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of attention to regenerating the downtown in Greenville and Columbia, but I don\u2019t think that necessarily creates unity in a city,\u201d Brinson said.\n\nThe town of Summerville recently developed a Vision Plan that includes a face-lift for Hutchinson Square in the center of its downtown.\n\nBut Summey, who lives off Montague near Park Circle, doesn\u2019t see the lack of a downtown as a shortcoming.\n\n\u201cA downtown limits you,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at everybody else that\u2019s got a downtown (in the Lowcountry), they can\u2019t keep up with us in retail sales. We don\u2019t have any one specific (retail) area, but if you go to downtown in the Olde Village, we still have the feeling of a small town, which is good.\u201d\n\nWith Tanger Outlets and many other shopping areas, North Charleston annually leads the state in retail sales, exceeding $6 billion dollars each year.\n\nBrinson, who represents a district that includes Coosaw Creek and part of Wescott Plantation, said the city\u2019s neighborhoods may vary in character, but their residents seem to share a common bond: an interest in civic and cultural activities.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just something North Charleston has dealt with,\u201d he said. \u201cThe neighborhoods are very disparate \u2014 that\u2019s an important part of who we are \u2014 but cultural arts and recreation are the things that pull a community together.\u201d\n\nIn addition, he said, public opinion of North Charleston is changing.\n\n\u201cOver the last four or five years we\u2019ve seen our city begin to rise above, if not its image, the perception of it being a blue collar, crime-ridden area,\u201d he said. \u201cMore and more people are taking pride in North Charleston as being the hub of economic development.\u201d\n\nYears ago, people in his section of the city used to ask for a Summerville mailing address.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hear that at all anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nReporters Robert Behre, Prentiss Findlay, Diane Knich, and David Slade contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "North Charleston has much to offer, just not a downtown, FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nCivic Science Poll, \r\nCivic Science Poll, Bob King,Downtown,Mayor Keith Summey,North Charleston,Olde Village,Ron Brinson", "og": {"site_name": "Post and Courier", "description": "When North Charleston residents Rachael and Todd Parker were buying their home two years ago, their top priority was the real estate agent\u2019s mantra: location, location, location.", "title": "North Charleston has much to offer, just not a downtown", "url": "http://www.postandcourier.com20150517/150519606/north-charleston-has-much-to-offer-just-not-a-downtown", "image": {"url": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150517/PC16/150519606/AR/0/AR-150519606.jpg", "identifier": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150517/PC16/150519606/AR/0/AR-150519606.jpg"}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "When North Charleston residents Rachael and Todd Parker were buying their home two years ago, their top priority was the real estate agent\u2019s mantra: location, location, location.", "title": "North Charleston has much to offer, just not a downtown", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"ipad": "Post and Courier", "iphone": "Post and Courier", "googleplay": "Post and Courier"}, "id": {"ipad": 603721271, "iphone": 603721271, "googleplay": "com.Synapse.PandC"}}, "site": "@postandcourier", "image": "http://www.postandcourier.com/storyimage/CP/20150517/PC16/150519606/AR/0/AR-150519606.jpg?201505172215", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "metered": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "c6511264bdb6fa45c6bb985fb86d3ab2"}, "fb": {"app_id": 146078808769941}, "tout": {"article": {"id": 150519606}}, "keywords": "North Charleston has much to offer, just not a downtown , FP LatestNews, \r\nFP LatestNewsMetro, \r\nCivic Science Poll, \r\nCivic Science Poll, Bob King,Downtown,Mayor Keith Summey,North Charleston,Olde Village,Ron Brinson", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-17T22:00:00Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-17T22:15:00Z", "author": "Brenda Rindge"}, "msvalidate.01": "05BAEC9D8820FA9F10D57DB6EB3C6192", "google-site-verification": "rAW9DX7yfiFF82k05QGF6LbZBkxcKxMTzAwNv0OCKAM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "When North Charleston residents Rachael and Todd Parker were buying their home two years ago, their top priority was the real estate agent\u2019s mantra: location, location, location."}, "article_summary": "They settled in the East Park Circle area of North Charleston, near the Olde Village, a portion of the East Montague area that stretches from Park Circle to Virginia Avenue.\nWhen North Charleston residents Rachael and Todd Parker were buying their home two years ago, their top priority was the real estate agent\u2019s mantra: location, location, location.\nOverall, he said, he\u2019s amazed at the way North Charleston has grown up.\n\u201cThat\u2019s just something North Charleston has dealt with,\u201d he said.\nNational Action Network leader Thomas Dixon said his group\u2019s demonstrations at North Charleston City Hall on Mall Drive immediately after Slager\u2019s arrest were effective."}
