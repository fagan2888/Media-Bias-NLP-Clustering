A nurse from a Bronx nursing home was charged Wednesday with raping an elderly patient who is unable to communicate, authorities said.

Nanic Aidasani, 42 years old, was arraigned on charges of second-degree attempted rape, sexual abuse and other charges in connection with the alleged attack at Manhattanville Health Care Center, according to a criminal complaint. He pleaded not guilty, and bail was set at $20,000.

Another employee reported hearing the suspect raping the woman around 1:20 a.m. Tuesday at the nursing home, according to a law-enforcement official.

The employee recognized Mr. Aidasani and reported the incident to a supervisor, the official said. When the supervisor responded to the room, the suspect had left.

Mr. Aidasani was arraigned in Bronx Criminal Court and assigned a defense attorney, who could not be reached for comment.

Mr. Aidasani has worked at the nursing home for seven months, the official said.

The woman is not able to speak as a result of a stroke in 2005, the official said. According to the criminal complaint, she suffers from dementia.

In a statement, the nursing home said that it conducts a criminal background check on all its employees and that Mr. Aidasani “has no sexual offense or criminal history.”

“We have a zero tolerance for abuse of any kind,” the center said.

According to the statement, the 64-year-old victim was transferred to a hospital for further evaluation, and the center was cooperating in the investigation.
