Tom Reed, R-Corning, didn\u2019t like about the compromise $1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill the House narrowly approved 219 to 206 on Thursday.\n\nBut the congressman worked hard in a bipartisan effort to have the Revitalize American Manufacturing Initiative (RAMI) bill he co-sponsored with Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., included in the omnibus bill.\n\n\u201cThere are many victories in this proposal,\u201d the congressman said. \u201cIt moves the ball forward in that it continues us on a path of reducing the budget deficit and authorizes less spending in FY 2015 than the agreed upon cap in the Murray-Ryan Budget Control Act.\n\n\u201cThe package is far from perfect and I do not agree with everything in it, but it cuts spending, advances a number of energy policies, contains no new spending for Obamacare, and protects and creates jobs by including my Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act. On balance it is a victory for taxpayers.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with the Times Herald Friday, Rep. Reed said, \u201cWe saw an opportunity\u201d to advance the RAMI bill in the omnibus bill.\n\nIt worked.\n\nThe RAMI bill had been a focus of Rep. Reed\u2019s in the 2014 legislative session and now in the lame duck session after the election. The two congressmen pushed RAMI to be added to the omnibus bill.\n\nSenators Roy Blunt, R-Mo., and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, shepherded the RAMI bill in the Senate and helped convinced Senate negotiators and Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to include it in the omnibus bill.\n\n\u201cThe four of us worked together to set it up for the omnibus. There were a lot of moving parts. I\u2019m very optimistic about the opportunities,\u201d Rep. Reed said.\n\n\u201cThere were pros and cons\u201d about the omnibus bill, he said. With RAMI included and its promise of training workers in advanced manufacturing and the creation of new jobs, it was a no-brainer for the Corning congressman.\n\nThe RAMI bill would establish regional Centers for Manufacturing Innovation to focus on the next generation of manufacturing technologies. Of course, Rep. Reed would like to see one of the centers in the 11-county 23rd Congressional District. With the Southern Tier\u2019s combination of manufacturers like Dresser-Rand and Corning Inc., and universities like Alfred University and St. Bonaventure University, and the University of Rochester to the north, Rep. Reed said, \u201cI can see it in our backyards. We have all the ingredients.\u201d\n\nThe bipartisan effort \u201cto create the jobs of tomorrow\u201d had its seed in the Southern Tier, Rep. Reed recalled. The idea evolved out of town halls he\u2019s conducted and factory tours he\u2019s taken over the past four years.\n\nThe congressman has been using the mantra \u201cbuild it here, sell it there\u201d for the past year to help advance RAMI.\n\n\u201cIt will be a tool in the tool box,\u201d Rep. Reed said. \u201cOur bill sets the stage for those jobs and makes sure the U.S. is a world leader in advanced manufacturing,\u201d Rep. Reed said. \u201cRAMI will create new high-tech, high-paying manufacturing jobs for our children and grandchildren.\u201d\n\nThe retraining of existing workers in American manufacturing as well as tomorrow\u2019s workers will come with \u201cfocusing critical resources in collaboration with public-private partnerships led by industry, universities, community colleges and non-profits,\u201d he added. \u201cIt also addresses the skills gap by producing the next generation of skilled workers and engineers focusing on education, workforce training, research and development and commercialization.\n\nThe Senate took up the Omnibus spending bill on Saturday, laboring under a midnight deadline to avoid a government shutdown and continue to fund federal agencies through next summer.\n\nIn the end, the Senate passed a five day-extension of the existing funding to keep the government operating through Wednesday.\n\nLate-breaking developments in the Senate led to the bill\u2019s approval, 56 to 40 shortly before press time.\n\nFor more details on the bill\u2019s passage, please see page A-6.\n\n(Contact reporter Rick Miller at rmiller@oleantimesherald.com.
