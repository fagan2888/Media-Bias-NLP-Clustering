STARKVILLE – It appears that the Belk Bowl was more than the final game for 13 Mississippi State seniors.

Junior wide receiver De’Runnya Wilson announced via Instagram that he has played his last collegiate game.

Wilson had two posts on Jan. 1 that read “A day before yesterday I played my last college football game 100 #blessed to be pushed by the best receiver core in the #nation remember #LBG I love y’all guys” and “Ended my college career #Belk bowl champs I’m goin to miss playing in maroon and white 100 #hailstate #forever”.

Wilson caught five passes for 96 yards and a touchdown in the Bulldogs’ 51-28 win over N.C. State on Wednesday.

The 6-foot-5, 215-pounder from Birmingham appeared in 38 games during his three seasons in Starkville with 24 starts. He hauled in 133 passes for 1,949 yards and 22 touchdowns, ranking fifth in catches, sixth in receiving yardage and second in receiving touchdowns in school history.

Wilson is coming off his best statistical season with 60 grabs for 918 yards and 10 touchdowns and was named second team All-SEC by the league’s coaches.

Wilson also suited up for the Bulldogs’ basketball team for seven games as a freshman. The former Mr. Basketball for the state of Alabama scored six points and grabbed 11 rebounds in 52 minutes of play.

As of Friday afternoon, MSU had yet to confirm Wilson’s intentions to forgo his senior season. Last year, the Bulldogs lost underclassman running back Josh Robinson and linebacker Benardrick McKinney to the NFL Draft.

Wilson is currently listed as the No. 10 wide receiver and projected as a second- to third-round selection in the NFL Draft by CBS Sports. He is rated as the 84th overall prospect.
