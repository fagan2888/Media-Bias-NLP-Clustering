Many of them were selling trapping lures.\n\nFriday and Saturday marked the first time the National Trappers Association has held a convention in South Dakota. Hosted by the South Dakota Trappers Association, around 1,000 people are expected to attend the event.\n\n\u201c(Low) fur prices aren\u2019t keeping people away. Locals are excited having the convention in our state,\u201d said Anna Hermanson, president of South Dakota Trappers Association. \u201cThey brought their families from all over to come to this event and vacation in the Black Hills.\u201d\n\nTrappers from coast to coast as well as some from Ontario, Canada, are attending the event.\n\nThe convention continues from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday.\n\n\u201cWe have trapping and skinning demos,\u201d Hermanson said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great way to learn about trapping. A lot of the old pros have new tricks. It\u2019s always neat to learn something new, especially when you get into a bind out in the field.\u201d\n\nChris McAllister, president of the National Trappers Association, said trapping is beneficial to the overall population of targeted species as well as the ecosystem.\n\n\u201cTrapping is no different than hunting. You have to reduce the excess population every year,\u201d McAllister said. \u201cFor most furbearers trapping is the only thing they are susceptible to. They aren\u2019t as vulnerable to hunting because they are largely nocturnal. In the end, trapping is the only efficient and effective way to control populations of furbearers.\u201d\n\nMcAllister said he enjoys trapping, and even though he has trapped since he was \u201cknee high,\u201d there\u2019s always something new to learn.\n\n\u201cIt takes an incredible amount of knowledge about the animal,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone can set a trap, but you need to set it where the animal is going to step. It\u2019s a lifelong learning experience to make yourself better.\u201d\n\nTo read all of today's stories, Click here or call 642-2761 to subscribe to our e-edition or home delivery.", "article_metadata": {"googlebot": "noarchive", "news_keywords": "local_news", "og": {"site_name": "Black Hills Pioneer", "description": "BUFFALO CHIP \u2014 The smell of skunk wafted over the Buffalo Chip Campground Friday, but that was just fine to the hundreds of people gathered there \u2014 it was the smell of money.", "title": "Convention gives trappers tips for next season", "url": "http://www.bhpioneer.com/local_news/convention-gives-trappers-tips-for-next-season/article_3304c47a-0bc9-11e5-be8e-f33861f99476.html", "image": {"width": 200, "identifier": "http://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/bhpioneer.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/4/0d/40d8ddfc-0bc9-11e5-8b65-e3ba9a564a11/557213a895950.image.jpg?resize=200%2C300", "height": 300}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@tweetmeme", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"app_id": 176896259007058}, "keywords": "local_news", "description": "BUFFALO CHIP \u2014 The smell of skunk wafted over the Buffalo Chip Campground Friday, but that was just fine to the hundreds of people gathered there \u2014 it was the smell of money."}, "article_summary": "Friday and Saturday marked the first time the National Trappers Association has held a convention in South Dakota.\nLocals are excited having the convention in our state,\u201d said Anna Hermanson, president of South Dakota Trappers Association.\nHosted by the South Dakota Trappers Association, around 1,000 people are expected to attend the event.\nSkunk essence is used in trapping lures and some bait to entice furbearing animals to come in for a close sniff or peek, and approximately 50 vendors were on hand at the campground for the National Trappers Association\u2019s Western Region Trapping Convention.\n\u201cAnyone can set a trap, but you need to set it where the animal is going to step."}
