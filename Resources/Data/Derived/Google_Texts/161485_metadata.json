Most patients assume their doctor is working in their best medical interests whenever he or she orders a diagnostic test or recommends a particular treatment. Customers might wonder whether an unscrupulous auto mechanic is being truthful when he recommends a brake job or a new transmission. But most patients trust that their doctor isn\u2019t recommending unnecessary surgeries merely to line his pockets.\n\nThe vast majority of doctors take their ethical responsibilities very seriously. Prior to Obamacare, only a relatively few \u201cbad apples\u201d have chosen to compromise their professional ethics for financial gain. However, Obamacare creates new ethical conflicts for doctors. We\u2019ll examine some common physician conflicts of interest before and after Obamacare, and discuss how patients can best protect themselves.\n\nMost doctors practice in a \u201cfee for service\u201d model, where they are paid for each service provided. This is routine in the rest of the economy \u2014 for example, consumers pay for each item purchased at the grocery store or each oil change for their car. However, fee for service can also create perverse incentives for unnecessary medical treatments, just as a dishonest auto mechanic has a perverse incentive to recommend unnecessary repair work.\n\nUnethical doctors can be tempted to \u201cdo more procedures than necessary\u2026\u201d\n\nUnethical doctors aren\u2019t usually quite as brazen as unethical auto mechanics, especially with major procedures such as surgery. But there are more subtle ways doctors can inappropriately pad their income. For example, a physician might order blood work on his patients \u2014 but preferentially direct his patients to a lab where he has an ownership stake (even if an independent lab down the street is less expensive and more accurate). This allows him to collect a portion of the lab\u2019s \u201ctechnical fee\u201d for performing each test.\n\nSimilarly, a recent study in the journal Radiology suggests that physicians order more unnecessary MRI tests when they have an ownership stake in the lab:\n\nKnee MRI exams are more likely to be negative if ordered by physicians who have a financial interest in the imaging equipment being used\u2026 \u201cWe believe that the inherent conflict of interest present when physicians both order and then perform and collect fees on the basis of the acquisition of MR imaging examinations is an important factor to consider whenever the matter of healthcare cost is raised,\u201d wrote lead author Dr. Matthew Lungren, from Duke University Medical Center\u2026\n\n(The authors also note: \u201cAlthough our study does suggest a bias toward increased utilization of MR imaging of the knee by physicians who own MR imaging equipment, by itself it does not prove intended overutilization for profit\u2026\u201d)\n\nThe New York Times also recently reported that, \u201cDoctors who have a financial interest in radiation treatment centers are much more likely to prescribe such treatments for patients with prostate cancer.\u201d Likewise, The Wall Street Journal has reported on potentially significant conflicts of interests when spine surgeons participate in \u201cphysician owned distributorships\u201d:\n\nPhysician-owned distributorships, or PODs\u2026 act as intermediaries between medical-device makers and hospitals: In exchange for marketing and stocking devices, the distributors get a cut of each sale. When surgeons own the distributorship, that commission goes into their pockets. And since surgeons often dictate to their hospitals which devices to buy, they can effectively steer business to themselves.\n\nUnethical doctors can thus be tempted to \u201cdo more procedures than necessary and to favor devices they profit from over more \u2018clinically appropriate\u2019 ones.\u201d\n\nFortunately, patients can protect themselves by asking their doctors a few simple questions. Patients can ask, \u201cDo you have any financial interest in the lab you\u2019re sending me to?\u201d Or, \u201cDo you have any financial incentives to use one manufacturer\u2019s surgical hardware over another?\u201d\n\nIf a doctor seems to be pushing an unnecessary surgery, patients should seek a second opinion. Patients can also consult resources such as ProPublica\u2019s \u201cDollars for Docs\u201d website, which lists which doctors have received money from the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nOf course, many doctors have legitimate consulting relationships with pharmaceutical companies and medical device manufacturers. Many important medical innovations have arisen from close collaborations between practicing physicians and private industry. Similarly, some physicians may prefer sending patients to testing facilities they also own and manage, because they can ensure the tests are performed to their precise specifications.\n\nPhysicians routinely disclose relevant financial and consulting relationships when speaking at scientific or educational conferences. Patients should feel free ask for that same information from their own doctors. Good doctors will not be offended if patients politely ask about potential financial conflicts of interest, just as they will not be offended when patients seek a second opinion about medical issues.\n\nObamacare also creates new conflicts of interest for physicians. One of the primary goals of Obamacare is to control health costs (i.e., \u201cbend the cost curve downward\u201d). Under Obamacare, doctors will face increasing incentives for undertreatment rather than overtreatment.\n\nFor example, Obamacare includes pilot programs to replace the current fee for service model with \u201cbundled payments.\u201d Hospitals and doctors would receive a fixed sum for treating a patient\u2019s condition (e.g., pneumonia or stroke), regardless of what it costs the providers. If the hospital and doctors treat the patient for less than the bundle, they keep the excess. But if their costs exceed the bundled payment, they must absorb the loss. In theory, bundled payments eliminate incentives to overtreat patients. But they can also create dangerous incentives to undertreat.\n\nA hospital administrator might ask a physician, \u201cDoes Mrs. Smith really need the stronger, more expensive antibiotic that covers 99% of the bacteria? Or can she get by with the cheaper drug that only covers 85%? We\u2019ve already burned through her bundled payment for this hospital admission, so anything we do now comes out of our pockets!\u201d\n\nThe federal government has also proposed linking physician payments to \u201cappropriate use criteria.\u201d Such government practice guidelines may be appropriate for many patients. However, there will always be patients who don\u2019t fit the guidelines. In those cases, doctors will have to choose between what\u2019s medically appropriate for their patient vs. adhering to the government-approved treatment guidelines.\n\nSuppose you see your doctor for a severe headache. He examines you and says, \u201cNope, you don\u2019t need an MRI scan. Take two Tylenol and call me in the morning.\u201d Is he acting in your best interests? Or is he being inappropriately swayed by government practice guidelines intended to limit MRI usage?\n\nTo cut costs, many Obamacare exchange plans also require \u201cnarrow networks\u201d of providers, where patients may only receive treatment from a short list of approved hospitals and doctors. President Obama has repeatedly promised, \u201cIf you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor,\u201d but many patients are learning the hard way that this isn\u2019t true.\n\nSuch \u201cnarrow networks\u201d also mean that many doctors will lose long-standing relationships with patients they\u2019ve seen for years. Instead, doctors will be increasingly reliant on the government-run exchanges for new patients. This will create a powerful incentive for physicians to adhere to any treatment guidelines mandated by the government or by government-approved insurance plans.\n\nFortunately, patients can still partially protect themselves from conflicts of interest created by Obamacare. Patients can ask their doctors if they have any incentives to limit their care (just as they can ask if their doctors have any incentives to favor particular treatments or tests).\n\nPatients should also consider paying cash when appropriate. New federal regulations allow patients who pay cash to request that the details of their medical care not be sent to insurance companies. This frees your doctor to concentrate on doing what\u2019s best for you without worrying that his treatment decisions might skew his practice statistics.\n\nSome patients may also benefit from \u201cdirect pay\u201d or \u201cconcierge\u201d practices outside the standard insurance system. This allows the doctor to work for the patient, without interference from the government or government-controlled insurers.\n\nPrior to Obamacare, a few unethical doctors have always been tempted to overtreat patients. The big unknown is how physicians will respond to new incentives created by Obamacare to undertreat patients. Obamacare will divide doctors\u2019 loyalty between the government (which will increasingly control their salaries) and you, the patient. How exactly that loyalty will be split will depend on each individual doctor. As economists say, \u201cIncentives matter.\u201d Under Obamacare, you should take steps to make sure your doctor still puts your medical interests first.\n\nRegards,\n\nPaul Hsieh\n\nfor The Daily Reckoning\n\nEd.
