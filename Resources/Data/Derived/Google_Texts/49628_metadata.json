Health officials at the screening emphasized that, despite the stigma sometimes associated with HPV, contracting the virus does not mean an individual \u201csleeps around.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not just people who are promiscuous,\u201d Tsue said. \u201cIt is everyone.\u201d\n\nThe CDC recommends that both males and females receive the HPV vaccination as part of a series of inoculations they get when they are 11 or 12 years old.\n\nNeal Jones, a longtime sports anchor at Kansas City television station KCTV5, said HPV was not something he gave any thought to when he found a lump on his neck a couple of years ago.\n\n\u201cI am not an idiot,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I had never heard of it.\u201d\n\nHe underwent a successful round of chemotherapy and radiation at the KU Cancer Center.\n\nAlthough Pap smears can provide early detection for cervical cancer, there\u2019s currently no test for men to detect oropharyngeal cancer.\n\nTsue said researchers are now examining a possible salivary screen. The best men can do now, he said, is to self-screen for lumps.\n\nTsue said his waiting room \u201cis now filled with 20- to 55-year-old attorneys and politicians and engineers that really get hit over the head with a hammer and end up with stage four cancer\u201d from a preventable virus.\n\nMike Sherry is a reporter for KCPT television in Kansas City, Mo., a partner in the Heartland Health Monitor team.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Health", "description": "Discussions about the dangers of the human papillomavirus (HPV) tend to focus on the risks it poses for cervical cancer.
