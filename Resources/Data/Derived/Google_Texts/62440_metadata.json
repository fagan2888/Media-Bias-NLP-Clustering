Agence France-Presse/Getty Images\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe\u2019s visit to Amsterdam next week includes a nuclear-security summit, a Group of Seven meeting on the Ukrainian crisis and a possible summit with South Korea\u2019s president. But his first order of business will be to visit the Anne Frank House.\n\nMr. Abe\u2019s visit to the hideout where the teenage Holocaust victim wrote her diary comes after a disturbing string of vandalism incidents in the Tokyo area involving Holocaust-related books. Earlier this year, more than 300 Japanese copies of Anne Frank\u2019s diary and related books were found to have their pages ripped out in at least 38 libraries and one bookstore in Tokyo and Yokohama.\n\nLast week, Tokyo police arrested an unemployed Tokyo man, charging him with ripping the pages out of 25 books. The man has not been identified by the police. Police haven\u2019t said whether he is a suspect in the other cases.\n\nThe diary is read widely by Japanese children and young adults, and the vandalism received international attention.\n\nA foreign ministry official said Mr. Abe wanted to convey the message that many Japanese were hurt by the vandalism. Mr. Abe will be the first Japanese leader to visit the Anne Frank site, the official said, adding that the visit was not directly prompted by the vandalism.\n\n\u201cHumbly accepting historical facts and passing them on to future generations is one step towards realizing peace,\u201d the foreign ministry said of the visit.\n\nMr. Abe has come under fire in South Korea, China and elsewhere over his view of history and comments by allies that questioned the basis for two-decade-old apologies by Japan over its actions in World War II. Last week, the prime minister said he would uphold those apologies, signaling he wanted to repair relations with South Korea ahead of a visit to East Asia next month by President Barack Obama.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is set to visit the house in Amsterdam where Anne Frank wrote her diary, following vandalism incidents in Tokyo involving Holocaust-related books.", "title": "Japanese Leader Abe To Visit Anne Frank\u2019s House", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/03/20/japanese-leader-abe-to-visit-anne-franks-house/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BS013_annefr_P_20140227020447.jpg"}, "site": "wsjasia", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "World", "article.headline": "Japanese Leader Abe To Visit Anne Frank\u2019s House", "description": "Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is set to visit the house in Amsterdam where Anne Frank wrote her diary, following vandalism incidents in Tokyo involving Holocaust-related books.", "article_section": "World", "author": "Toko Sekiguchi", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Japan Real Time Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Japan Real Time", "article.summary": "Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is set to visit the house in Amsterdam where Anne Frank wrote her diary, following vandalism incidents in Tokyo involving Holocaust-related books.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-03-20T09:08:19-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-142", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/03/20/japanese-leader-abe-to-visit-anne-franks-house/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-JRTB-16440", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "World", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is set to visit the house in Amsterdam where Anne Frank wrote her diary, following vandalism incidents in Tokyo involving Holocaust-related books.", "title": "Japanese Leader Abe To Visit Anne Frank\u2019s House", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/03/20/japanese-leader-abe-to-visit-anne-franks-house/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-BS013_annefr_P_20140227020447.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Japan Real Time", "article.id": "BL-JRTB-16440", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-03-20T09:10:06-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce7b5\"", "article_summary": "Mr. Abe will be the first Japanese leader to visit the Anne Frank site, the official said, adding that the visit was not directly prompted by the vandalism.\nRipped pages of three books of Anne Frank\u2019s \u201cDiary of Young Girl\u201d are displayed at a library in Tokyo.\nBut his first order of business will be to visit the Anne Frank House.\nLast week, Tokyo police arrested an unemployed Tokyo man, charging him with ripping the pages out of 25 books.\nA foreign ministry official said Mr. Abe wanted to convey the message that many Japanese were hurt by the vandalism."}
