These plans are considered group health plans subject to the market reforms under the ACA. Those reforms ban annual limits on essential health benefits and require that certain preventative measures, such as mammograms, are free.\n\nAnd employers' group plans can't merge with individual coverage to satisfy the ACA provisos.\n\nThe upshot is a fine of $100 per day excise tax per employee, or $36,500 a year per employee under Section 4980D of the Internal Revenue Code.\n\nThe Department of Labor (DOL) issued Technical Release 2013-03 that is almost identical to the IRS notice, and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is expected to release a similar proviso.\n\nTrending {{item['sft-title']}}\n\nAndrew R. Biebl, a partner at accounting firm CliftonLarsonAllen in Minneapolis, Minn., told the New York Times late last month that the IRS ruling could upend tactics used in many businesses.\n\n\"For decades, employers have been assisting employees by reimbursing them for health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs,\" Biebl said. \"The new federal ruling eliminates many of those arrangements by imposing an unusually punitive penalty.\"\n\nHere are highlights from the IRS notice about employer payment plans and reimbursement accounts.
