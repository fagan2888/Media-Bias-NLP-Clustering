Monday night 8pm ABC 1. MasterChef: Chicken dramas 2:05 Play video It's a race against the clock as Colin tries to cook his chicken all the way through. Courtesy: Channel Ten\n\nSHE was dubbed the \u201ctough cookie\u201d single mum during the 2013 season of MasterChef, but this contestant now claims she left the cooking show a \u201cbasket case.\u201d\n\nJules Allen, a 39-year-old social worker and foster mother from Lennox Head on NSW\u2019s north coast, spills the beans to ABC\u2019s Australian Story tonight, revealing the bitter taste left by her reality TV experience and how exposed she feels contestants are across similar programs on all free-to-air networks.\n\nMASTERCHEF BEAUTY: Contestant to return to modelling\n\nFRAUD CLAIMS: Former MasterChef contestant hit outs\n\nAllen, who made the top 12 on the Ten series, said while she was \u201cencouraged to sort of crack open\u201d for the cameras, \u201cthe problem is at the end there\u2019s no one to put you back together.\u201d\n\nThe immersive nature of the experience and the pressure-cooker challenges made contestants feel like a \u201cbasket case\u201d, Allen argues, although she accepts it\u2019s what they all signed up for.\n\n\u201cLiving with the same 24 people 24 hours a day is not real. Cooking for three judges is not real. It\u2019s not reality television. It\u2019s orchestrated television for the purposes of entertaining a viewer.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an entertainer but you\u2019re a powerless entertainer and a vulnerable entertainer and you don\u2019t realise that until you\u2019re some way down the track,\u201d she tells ABC1.\n\n\u201cAfter four-and-a-half months on MasterChef, you\u2019re gone. You\u2019re kaput. There\u2019s no transition at all. You\u2019re spat out into a foreign world because you\u2019re not the person you were when you left.\u201d\n\nShe claims she felt \u201ccompletely alone in that. I was a basket case really. I had nightmares for weeks ... it is really difficult for everyone.\u201d\n\nCOMMENT BELOW: Should Jules Allen have expected the experience she got?\n\nWhile her comments relate to her time on MasterChef, Allen speaks for all reality TV contestants, stating: \u2018It\u2019s not just MasterChef. It\u2019s whether you\u2019re on The Block, or MKR (My Kitchen Rules) or The Biggest Loser \u2014 the end result is ritual humiliation on national television. The worst thing is we signed up for it. Try reconciling that in yourself.\n\n\u201cIn defence of MasterChef, we were told to expect the unexpected \u2014 but you can\u2019t fathom what that means.\u201d\n\nMasterChef production company Shine Australia defended the Channel 10 series, arguing they take their \u201cresponsibilities and duty of care to contestants very seriously indeed. Extensive support is provided throughout production, and after when required.\u201d\n\nOn the upside, Allen\u2019s exposure on the show has been helpful in raising awareness for her charity work, including working with Deborra-Lee Furness as an ambassador for National Adoption Awareness Week.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ve been some tough things, but at the end of the day for a charity worker to have a public profile is a dream come true.\u201d\n\nAustralian Story airs at 8pm tonight on ABC1\n\nPICTURES: Vienna\u2019s Life Ball", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "news.com.au", "description": "SHE was dubbed the &#8220;tough cookie&#8221; single mum during the 2013 season of MasterChef, but this contestant now claims she left the cooking show a &#8220;basket case.&#8221;", "generator": "legacy", "og": {"site_name": "NewsComAu", "description": "SHE was dubbed the &#8220;tough cookie&#8221; single mum during the 2013 season of MasterChef, but this contestant now claims she left the cooking show a &#8220;basket case.&#8221;", "title": "MasterChef contestant Jules Allen tells Australian Story reality TV left her a basket case", "url": "http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/masterchef-contestant-jules-allen-tells-australian-story-reality-tv-left-her-a-basket-case/story-fn8yvfst-1226939959886", "image": "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2014/06/02/1226939/959411-7db0aa42-e9f2-11e3-bb45-046f3d36ad52.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "http://resources3.news.com.au/images/2014/06/02/1226939/959411-7db0aa42-e9f2-11e3-bb45-046f3d36ad52.jpg"}, "site": {"identifier": "@newscomauHQ", "id": "@newscomauHQ"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "robots": "noarchive", "fb": {"admins": "1533025129,653135158,737988273", "app_id": 113758722003364}, "articleid": 1226939959886, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://resources.newscdn.com.au/cs/nca/latest/public/img/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "application-name": "news.com.au", "article": {"publisher": "News Limited", "publicationdate": "Mon Jun 02 17:23:33 EST 2014", "modified_time": "Mon Jun 02 17:23:33 EST 2014", "author": "Holly Byrnes National TV writer"}, "keywords": "free-to-air networks, pressure-cooker challenges, bitter taste, immersive nature, vulnerable entertainer, national television, Xavier Doran, Holly Byrnes, Deborra Lee Furness, Dan Tuddenham, basket case, nightmares, powerless entertainer, basket case, reality television, charity worker, production company, end result, ,Lennox Head,New South Wales,Australia, Vern Fitzgerald, Jules Allen, Daniel Churchill, Christina Batista, Daniel Kelty, crack open, MasterChef, Australian Story, ABC, Channel Ten, Shine", "google-site-verification": "GWTbDFKaKnGKyk3q0Na5jIbWHZ4qXn-ibcfMayjSQA0", "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9c10\"", "article_summary": "While her comments relate to her time on MasterChef, Allen speaks for all reality TV contestants, stating: \u2018It\u2019s not just MasterChef.\nVideoVideoImage Australian Story: Out of the kitchen 0:20 Play video An intriguing glimpse behind the scenes of the reality TV phenomenon that's captured the TV landscape in Australia.\nIt\u2019s not reality television.\n\u201cAfter four-and-a-half months on MasterChef, you\u2019re gone.\n\u201cYou\u2019re an entertainer but you\u2019re a powerless entertainer and a vulnerable entertainer and you don\u2019t realise that until you\u2019re some way down the track,\u201d she tells ABC1."}
