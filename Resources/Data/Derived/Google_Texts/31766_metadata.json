Jan Brewer won\u2019t appear on Tuesday\u2019s primary ballot, but she\u2019s not sitting on the sidelines, either.\n\nThe lame-duck Republican governor has jumped into the fray by endorsing more than a dozen state primary candidates, many of them Republican legislators who now face conservative primary challenges after backing her move to expand Medicaid in 2013.\n\nHer splashiest move came two weeks ago when she threw her support behind former Mesa Mayor Scott Smith, the most moderate of the six Republicans seeking the gubernatorial nomination.\n\nSEE ALSO: Don\u2019t tell Hillary! Women lack ambition, confidence to succeed in politics: study\n\n\u201cShe threw down the gauntlet in terms of her legacy on this one,\u201d said Arizona political analyst Mike O'Neil, who hosts \u201cThe Think Tank\u201d on KTAR-FM in Phoenix. \u201cShe is supporting people who have supported her platform This is a big deal.\u201d\n\nWhether those Republicans will benefit from \u201cBrewer\u2019s bounce,\u201d as 12News in Phoenix described it, remains to be seen. Ms. Brewer is boosting her endorsed candidates with funding from her Arizona Legacy PAC, but conservatives have targeted them for defeat, calling them \u201clegis-traitors\u201d and \u201cBrewercrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody has any idea what\u2019s going to happen. She could win them all, she could lose them all,\u201d said Mr. O'Neil.\n\nSEE ALSO: Hickenlooper reverses course on Colorado death penalty\n\nAccording to the Alliance of Principled Conservatives, which has been encouraging primary challenges for the past year, the Republican-dominated legislature went astray to the left last year by supporting Common Core and agreeing to expand \u201cObrewercare.\u201d Ms. Brewer herself also vetoed a religious freedom bill in February after coming under intense national pressure from gay groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the gubernatorial race has boiled down to a three-way contest among Mr. Smith; state Treasurer Doug Ducey, who\u2019s the former CEO of Cold Stone Creamery; and political newcomer Christine Jones, former legal counsel of GoDaddy.\n\nSo far Mr. Ducey leads in most of the polls, and last month he won the endorsement of the Arizona Republic, the state\u2019s largest newspaper. The GOP primary winner will face former Arizona Board of Regents member Fred DuVal, the only Democratic candidate for governor.\n\n\u201cDucey, a strong conservative, has a focus on fiscal and economic issues that would bode well for Arizona\u2019s future,\u201d said the July 29 editorial. \u201cHe believes a stable, financially solvent Arizona can compete favorably for jobs with other states. He is right.\u201d\n\nThe other Republican candidates \u2014 Secretary of State Ken Bennett, former Rep. Frank Riggs and former Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas \u2014 are bringing up the rear in surveys, but analysts point out that anything could happen in this year\u2019s primary.\n\nThat\u2019s because an unprecedented number of independent voters have request primary ballots. Under a state ballot measure approved by voters in 1998, unaffiliated voters may participate in the Republican or Democratic primaries, but only about 7 percent did so two years ago.\n\nThis year, 83,448 independents have requested primary ballots in Maricopa County, the state\u2019s most populous county, up from the 43,500 who voted in 2012. Of those, 60 percent asked for GOP ballots and 25 percent requested Democratic ballots, according to the Arizona Republic.\n\nThe influx of independents could be a good sign for Mr. Scott, who\u2019s the clear moderate in an otherwise conservative field. If the five conservatives split the vote, then Mr. Scott could wind up with the nomination with a slim plurality.\n\nTim Sifert, spokesman for the Arizona Republican Party, said 14 percent of those casting ballots in the primary as of Monday were independents, but he expects that figure to drop as last-minute Republican voters head to the polls Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of those ballots still in the hands of Republican voters. I expect that percentage [of independents] to go down,\u201d said Mr. Sifert.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Arizona Gov.
