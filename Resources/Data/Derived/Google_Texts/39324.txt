Douglas County Commissioner Jack Hilbert is leaving the board July 13 and is taking a job with the Colorado Department of Human Services.

Hilbert will take over as systems manager for the new child welfare hotline of the child welfare protection division in human services. That hotline will be up and running in January 2015.

“Although my plan had been to complete my second term as commissioner and then to continue serving Douglas County as a state representative, the opportunity to serve and protect our state’s youngest and most vulnerable population was an opportunity I could not let pass me by,” Hilbert said in a statement.

Hilbert was elected Douglas County commissioner in 2006 and re-elected to a second term in 2010.

A committee of the Douglas County Republican Party will choose who will fill Hilbert’s seat, which expires in November. One potential candidate is Douglas County Sheriff David Weaver, who already is running for Hilbert’s seat.

The committee has 10 days from Hilbert’s last day on the commission to name a temporary county commissioner.

“Douglas County’s loss is the state’s gain, and great news for families and children in Colorado,” Commissioner Jill Repella said.
