Even as a kid, she recalls, \u201cI really had always wanted a Christmas tree.\u201d\n\nBut Sims grew up in \u201ca pretty traditional Jewish family,\u201d she says, and entreaties to her parents for a \u201cHanukkah bush\u201d \u2014 a sort of Christmas tree analog in tenuous Judaic wrapping \u2014 fell on deaf ears.\n\n\u201cMy parents didn\u2019t buy it,\u201d Sims says with a laugh. \u201cThat was one thing they were not going to do.\u201d\n\nNow, Sims is married, has two sons and celebrates a traditional Hanukkah much like the ones she knew growing up. But Sims and her family also add a touch of Christmas to their year-end holiday celebration, too.\n\nSims\u2019 husband, Damon, was raised in a Christian household and celebrated a traditional Christmas. The year-end customs the family has created allow her sons to learn about and appreciate both of their parents\u2019 holiday heritages, Sims says.\n\nThe traditions they enjoy \u2014 a Christmas tree with Star of David topper, nightly menorah lighting during Hanukkah, traditional foods representing both Damon\u2019s and Davida\u2019s heritages \u2014 are the family\u2019s solution to what\u2019s often called the \u201cDecember dilemma,\u201d which Jewish and non-Jewish spouses experience each year as Christmas and Hanukkah arrive.\n\nThe conundrum can occur in any marriage of a Jewish spouse and a non-Jewish spouse. But it\u2019s particularly acute for Jewish-Christian families, because both holidays \u2014 Hanukkah as a Jewish festival of religious freedom and identity, and Christmas as a Christian observance of Jesus\u2019 birth \u2014 tend to fall near each other on the secular calendar. Hanukkah begins Tuesday evening this year.\n\nRabbi Sanford Akselrad of Congregation Ner Tamid says the December dilemma can be more accurately referred to in the plural, given its evolution during the past half-century or so.\n\nFor example, in the years after World War II, both Christmas and Hanukkah, for better or worse, became increasingly commercialized. It was in those years, Akselrad says, as Christmas became a bigger gift-giving holiday, that Jewish parents \u201cbegan to feel sensitive that perhaps their kids were missing out on something.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the early 1960s, when I grew up, the intermarriage rate was 5 percent,\u201d Akselrad says, and \u201cfor the most part, Jewish households were homogeneous and Christian households were homogeneous. So, really, the December dilemma was defined as, \u2018What do we do to make sure our children feel secure in being Jewish when they\u2019re a minority?\u2019 \u2018How do we make sure our children don\u2019t feel left out, because their non-Jewish friends were opening all these presents?\u2019 \u201d\n\nFor some Jewish parents, the answer was to make Hanukkah \u201ca bigger deal in some cases,\u201d he says.\n\nThen, as the 20th century progressed, increased intermarriage among non-Orthodox Jewish and non-Jewish spouses added another dimension to the December dilemma.\n\nAkselrad notes that one recent estimate holds that, in the Reform movement of Judaism, \u201cupwards of 70 percent are marriages out of the faith. More Jews are marrying people who are not Jews, and the result is the dilemma (of) two religions in one household. So the dilemma now is, \u2018How do we respect both faith traditions?\u2019\n\n\u201cSo we put a Jewish star on top of the Christmas tree. So we make sugar cookies in the shape of Jewish stars,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAll of these solutions \u2014 in quotes \u2014 are coming from people who are wrestling with real-time changes. They\u2019re not coming from rabbis saying, \u2018This is what you should do and this is what you should not do.\u2019 They\u2019re coming from people who say, \u2018Know what? I like this, I don\u2019t like that, this is what I\u2019m going to do.\u2019 They come up with their own traditions.\u201d\n\nWhat was it about Christmas that fascinated Sims as a kid?\n\n\u201cI grew up in America,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it just seemed that\u2019s, like, just part of America that I felt I\u2019d really missed out on.\u201d\n\nSims remembers one year when she rode her bike to a dollar store, \u201cbought a bunch of tchotchkes and wrapped them up, and took a little piece of butcher paper and drew a tree and put it in my closet and put little presents under it. I\u2019m a fourth-generation American and I just felt like there was a piece of American culture I was missing out on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get that it had anything to do with Jesus or anything,\u201d Sims adds. \u201cBut I had a soft spot for Christmas.\u201d\n\nSims and her husband have been married 17 years. They have two sons, Miles, 12, and Cole, 10, both of whom attend classes at the Adelson Educational Campus. The boys are being raised in the Jewish faith and Sims describes her home as a Jewish household.\n\nBut when she and Damon were preparing to celebrate their first holiday season together, \u201cI said to him, \u2018I really want a Christmas tree.\u2019 He said, \u2018You don\u2019t have to do that.\u2019 I said, \u2018No, I really want a Christmas tree.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe talked about buying a plastic one. I said, \u2018No, it\u2019s gotta be fresh.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI was so excited,\u201d Sims adds. \u201cI did the whole thing. I went Christmas shopping for decorations. I had none of the family heirlooms, nothing like that, so I went out and did the Christmas shopping. I even went to, like, Bed, Bath &Beyond and Body Works and bought little things to put under the tree for myself, because I didn\u2019t know how it works.\u201d\n\nBut when the boys arrived, they had a decision to make.\n\n\u201cAnd I felt really excited, honestly, about the idea of just, whatever we did, we were creating this brand-new Sims family tradition in that my kids were going to think this is how it\u2019s done and be excited about it when they get older,\u201d she says.\n\nThe family observes each night of Hanukkah by lighting candles, choosing from among the many menorahs they\u2019ve collected over the years. The boys receive small Hanukkah gifts \u2014 a book or a game \u2014 and, on one night, Sims will make traditional latkes, or potato pancakes.\n\nThen, the family also celebrates a bit of secular Christmas. They do have a tree, but it\u2019s topped with a Star of David and some of its ornaments feature menorahs.\n\nHowever, Sims says, \u201cother than that, we don\u2019t mix it and, obviously, we have very secular decorations.\u201d\n\nOn Christmas morning, the family awakens, shares hot cocoa and sings, and \u201cthen we go to my mother-in-law\u2019s to see her tree, and she does have Christmas dinner,\u201d Sims says.\n\nBy celebrating both holidays, the children are able to learn about and appreciate both sides of their familial heritage, Sims says.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the importance,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s literally the Sims\u2019 family Christmas we got to create, so my boys have these wonderful family traditions. That\u2019s what it\u2019s really all about.\u201d\n\nAlthough intermarriage between non-Orthodox Jewish and non-Jewish spouses has become more common, Akselrad says couples seldom seek him out for counseling about solving the December dilemma.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a lot of people knocking on my door, (saying) \u2018I\u2019m wrestling with it,\u2019 \u201d he says, but \u201cI know it by observation.\u201d\n\nMaybe it\u2019s embarrassment. Or intimidation. Or simply that couples assume they know what a rabbi will say.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think someone would say, \u2018Rabbi , is it OK if I had a Christmas tree?\u2019 because they know the rabbi will say \u2018No,\u2019 so why ask the question?\u201d Akselrad says. \u201cI think there\u2019s some embarrassment.\u201d\n\nYet, he adds, \u201cI know it\u2019s on people\u2019s minds.\u201d\n\nAnd in his own mind? \u201cIt\u2019s going to depend on the individual,\u201d Akselrad says.\n\nAkselrad advises couples seeking to enter into interfaith marriages that, even before they marry, they need to decide on a tradition for their homes.\n\nOtherwise, he says, there\u2019s a potential for not just ambiguity, but conflict.\n\nDoes Sims ever feel, maybe, a twinge of guilt about recognizing Christmas in her home?\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she answers. \u201cI work in a Jewish day school, and my kids are going to a Jewish day school, so there\u2019s definitely even been moments in big groups of people (when) I didn\u2019t talk about it. But I also have always encouraged my kids to talk about it, that it doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not Jewish and doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s anything wrong with that.\u201d\n\nStill, she says, sometimes \u201csomebody might say, \u2018Oh, really? You do Christmas?\u2019\n\n\u201cI would say, realistically, that this is my husband\u2019s favorite childhood memory. How could I ever say to him, \u2018No, you\u2019re not going to share with your kids the greatest thing from your childhood\u2019? Religion or not, that just can\u2019t be right.\u201d\n\nContact reporter John Przybys at jprzybys@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0280.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Christian and Jewish couples often find this time of year challenging as they celebrate and respect each other\u2019s religious traditions of Christmas and Hanukkah.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "JOHN PRZYBYS LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-title": "\u2018December dilemma\u2019 challenges interfaith families", "parsely-link": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/religion/december-dilemma-challenges-interfaith-families", "twitter": {"description": "Christian and Jewish couples often find this time of year challenging as they celebrate and respect each other\u2019s religious traditions of Christmas and Hanukkah.", "title": "\u2018December dilemma\u2019 challenges interfaith families", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/religion/december-dilemma-challenges-interfaith-families", "image": {"src": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_3-2_HANUKKAH_004.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_HANUKKAH_002.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_HANUKKAH_001.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_HANUKKAH_003.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_HANUKKAH_005.jpg, http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_HANUKKAH_006.jpg"}, "creator": {"identifier": "@reviewjournal", "id": 15358759}, "card": "summary"}, "vf": {"unique_id": "reviewjournal-nid-1971741"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=2349024", "app_name": "review-journal", "package": "com.LVRJ"}, "ios": {"url": "review-journal://?eid=2349024", "app_store_id": 540820524, "app_name": "review-journal"}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1098299519", "fb": {"admins": 630759385, "app_id": 195491203833571}, "google-play-app": "app-id=com.LVRJ", "og": {"site_name": "Las Vegas Review-Journal", "description": "Christian and Jewish couples often find this time of year challenging as they celebrate and respect each other\u2019s religious traditions of Christmas and Hanukkah.", "title": "\u2018December dilemma\u2019 challenges interfaith families", "url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/life/religion/december-dilemma-challenges-interfaith-families", "image": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_3-2_HANUKKAH_004.jpg", "type": "article"}, "parsely-author": "JOHN PRZYBYS LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "Religion,Life,", "parsely-section": "Religion", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-13T18:29:53-08:00"}, "parsely-tags": "Religion,Life", "parsely-image-url": "http://www.reviewjournal.com/sites/default/files/field/media/web1_WEB_3-2_HANUKKAH_004.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-12-14T02:29:53Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1ba0\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s literally the Sims\u2019 family Christmas we got to create, so my boys have these wonderful family traditions.\nSo the dilemma now is, \u2018How do we respect both faith traditions?\u2019\u201cSo we put a Jewish star on top of the Christmas tree.\nThey\u2019re not coming from rabbis saying, \u2018This is what you should do and this is what you should not do.\u2019 They\u2019re coming from people who say, \u2018Know what?\nThen, as the 20th century progressed, increased intermarriage among non-Orthodox Jewish and non-Jewish spouses added another dimension to the December dilemma.\nMore Jews are marrying people who are not Jews, and the result is the dilemma (of) two religions in one household."}
