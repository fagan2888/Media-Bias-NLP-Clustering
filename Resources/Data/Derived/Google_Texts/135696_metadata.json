It was only fair that a rock concert got to join in the fun with Queens of the Stone Age landing in town this week.\n\nThe desert rockers played their biggest stage in Toronto yet, headlining the Air Canada Centre for the first time along with support act The Guards.\n\nIlluminated by a 20-foot screen that showcased the dystopian work of recent collaborator U.K. artist Boneface, QOTSA played a full 20-track set with minimal filler and a workman-like attitude.\n\nTouring behind \u2026Like Clockwork, the band\u2019s sixth album and first No.1 on the Billboard 200 chart, frontman Josh Homme kicked things off with the LP\u2019s lead single \u201cMy God Is The Sun.\u201d \u201cNo One Knows,\u201d perhaps QOTSA\u2019s biggest hit track, was played shortly thereafter, getting the night off to a good start.\n\nHomme kept his stage banter to a minimum, a slight departure from his normal talkative self. \u201cOn tequila, I\u2019m Josh,\u201d Homme said during a brief moment after he introduced his fellow bandmates.\n\nA triumvirate of slower tracks in the middle of the set appeared to dampen much of the band\u2019s momentum with the crowd, although a reworked version of the rarely played Rated R\u2019s \u201cIn The Fade\u201d stood out from the pack.\n\nThe crowd picked up some steam during \u201cLullabies To Paralyze\u2019s\u201d \u201cLittle Sister\u201d and \u201cSmooth Sailing,\u201d a boogie-driven track from the band\u2019s new album. The song \u201cMake It Wit Chu\u201d was introduced by Homme calling for some romantic candlelight, ad asking the crowd for some help with the song\u2019s chorus.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad that you\u2019re here,\u201d Homme stated. \u201cIt feels like it\u2019s just us alone here now.\u201d\n\nAnd while Homme and Co. moved things along gingerly with several grinding, pulsating tunes, such as \u201cSick Sick Sick\u201d and \u201cGo With The Flow,\u201d the high point of the show focused on the band\u2019s guitar-heavy repertoire.\n\n\u201cBetter Living Through Chemistry,\u201d another track from the band\u2019s critically acclaimed \u201cRated R\u201d album, also got the reworked treatment, complete with a five-minute-long jam session sandwiched between a solemn, choral-like vocal interlude.\n\nEdgier tracks that were staples at prior QOTSA shows were omitted from the setlist, such as \u201cFeel Good Hit of the Summer\u201d and \u201cRegular John\u201d \u2014a slight nod to the band\u2019s newer fanbase.\n\nBut Homme wasn\u2019t afraid to leave things on a dark note. The band\u2019s three-song encore ended the night with the explosive \u201cSong For The Dead,\u201d another metal-heavy number that had the crowd\u2019s ears ringing for as they headed out into the humid September night.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age Set List: September 10, 2013, Air Canada Centre, Toronto, Ontario:\n\nMy God Is The Sun\n\nMillionaire\n\nNo One Knows\n\nBurn The Witch\n\nFirst It Giveth\n\nKeep Your Eyes Peeled\n\nKalopsia\n\nIn The Fade\n\n\u2026Like Clockwork\n\nIf I Had A Tail\n\nLittle Sister\n\nSmooth Sailing\n\nMake It Wit Chu\n\nI Sat By The Ocean\n\nBetter Living Through Chemistry\n\nSick Sick Sick\n\nGo With The Flow\n\nEncore:\n\nThe Vampyre of Time And Memory\n\nI Appear Missing\n\nSong For The Dead", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Queens of the Stone Age played their biggest stage yet in Toronto, headlining the Air Canada Centre this week during the Toronto International Film Festival.", "title": "Queens of the Stone Age Rock Toronto", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/09/12/queens-of-the-stone-age-rock-toronto/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YW140_qotsa_G_20130911033455.jpg"}, "site": "WSJspeakeasy", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "Arts", "article.headline": "Queens of the Stone Age Rock Toronto", "description": "Queens of the Stone Age played their biggest stage yet in Toronto, headlining the Air Canada Centre this week during the Toronto International Film Festival.", "article_section": "Arts", "author": "David George-Cosh", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Speakeasy Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Speakeasy", "article.summary": "Queens of the Stone Age played their biggest stage yet in Toronto, headlining the Air Canada Centre this week during the Toronto International Film Festival.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2013-09-12T22:00:41-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-143", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/09/12/queens-of-the-stone-age-rock-toronto/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-SEB-76907", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Arts", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Queens of the Stone Age played their biggest stage yet in Toronto, headlining the Air Canada Centre this week during the Toronto International Film Festival.", "title": "Queens of the Stone Age Rock Toronto", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2013/09/12/queens-of-the-stone-age-rock-toronto/", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OB-YW140_qotsa_G_20130911033455.jpg", "height": 369}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Speakeasy", "article.id": "BL-SEB-76907", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-09-12T15:19:51-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Getty Images Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age on Sept. 1 at the Budweiser Made In America Festival in Philadelphia.\nIt was only fair that a rock concert got to join in the fun with Queens of the Stone Age landing in town this week.\n\u201cOn tequila, I\u2019m Josh,\u201d Homme said during a brief moment after he introduced his fellow bandmates.\nFor the last few days, Canada\u2019s biggest city took its annual turn in the limelight hosting the Toronto International Film Festival.\nThe desert rockers played their biggest stage in Toronto yet, headlining the Air Canada Centre for the first time along with support act The Guards."}
