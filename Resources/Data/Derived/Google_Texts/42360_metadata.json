Barbara Boxer, called it a carefully crafted compromise.\n\nThey are hoping to clear the bill through their committee this week, then hope the Finance Committee can find the funding to round it out before the end of July, when existing highway funds run out. If the fund goes belly up, the government could no longer reimburse states for their projects, and some may default on their debts.\n\nSEE ALSO: White House: Up to Republicans to deliver full trade package\n\n\u201cI think if you have a heartbeat and a pulse, you understand \u2014 this needs to be done,\u201d Mrs. Boxer said.\n\nBut winning passage will not be easy. A long-term highway bill has eluded Congress for years, as lawmakers squabble over funding and rely on stopgap patches or two-year extensions. A six-year authorization would its longest in about a decade.\n\nThe short-term bills have left states and industries unable to plan for the long-term, left 61,000 bridges structurally deficient and left roughly half of the country\u2019s roads in disrepair. Faulty infrastructure has a ripple effect throughout the economy, the bill\u2019s backers said \u2014 people wreck their cars, and manufacturers struggle to bring their products to major ports.\n\nSEE ALSO: Hillary Clinton tells Americans to face their racism\n\nCurrent highway funding is based chiefly on the federal 18.4 cents-per-gallon gas tax \u2014 25 cents for diesel \u2014 and levies on heavy trucks.\n\nThe tax hasn\u2019t been raised since 1993, and would approach 30 cents per gallon if it had been adjusted for inflation. Cars have also become more fuel-efficient over the two decades, so revenues are down.\n\nHouse Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer, Maryland Democrat, said Tuesday his preference is raise the gas tax, but that idea has been rejected by GOP leaders who say a gas tax hike is a non-starter.\n\n\u201cObviously the key is, how are you going to pay for it?\u201d Mr. Hoyer said of a final highway bill deal.\n\nRepublican leaders on the House Ways and Means Committee are trying to see if enough revenue can be squeezed out of a plan to try to entice companies to repatriate foreign income back to the U.S. But that\u2019s been an elusive goal.\n\n\u201cWe have not made any decisions on an approach or time frame,\u201d said Brendan Buck, spokesman for Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican.\n\nMrs. Boxer said she\u2019d be open to a form of international tax reform or a laundry list of other ways to fund it, so long as it gets done.\u201dThis is an investment that comes back to us over and over again,\u201d Mrs. Boxer said.\n\nBut Mr. Inhofe said it\u2019s up to the money committees to find the funds.\u201dThat isn\u2019t our job to do that, and they are working on that as we speak,\u201d Mr. Inhofe said.\n\nMrs. Boxer and Mr. Inhofe are staunch opponents on most environmental issues but said if they could \u201cswallow hard\u201d and accept the compromise infrastructure bill, then other lawmakers can find a way to come up with funding and push the bill across the finish line.\n\n\u201cThis is the one area where Barbara and I love each other,\u201d said Mr. Inhofe.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee unveiled a bill Tuesday to reauthorize funding for transportation projects for six years, saying the nation's crumbling roads and bridges need a long-term fix and that Congress should be able to rally around their bipartisan package.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee unveiled a bill Tuesday to reauthorize funding for transportation projects for six years, saying the nation\u2019s crumbling roads and bridges need a long-term fix and that Congress should be able to rally around their bipartisan package.", "title": "Senators unveil 6-year highway bill, set up race to pay for and pass bill by July", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/23/senators-unveil-6-year-highway-bill-set-race-pay-a/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/21/ec2729fe3c11b918570f6a70670005f7.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/21/ec2729fe3c11b918570f6a70670005f7.jpg", "description": "The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee unveiled a bill Tuesday to reauthorize funding for transportation projects for six years, saying the nation's crumbling roads and bridges need a long-", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Senators unveil 6-year highway bill, set up race to pay for and pass b"}, "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Business Finance, Politics, Barbara Boxer, James Inhofe"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcca08\"", "article_summary": "But Mr. Inhofe said it\u2019s up to the money committees to find the funds.\u201dThat isn\u2019t our job to do that, and they are working on that as we speak,\u201d Mr. Inhofe said.\n\u201cObviously the key is, how are you going to pay for it?\u201d Mr. Hoyer said of a final highway bill deal.\nA long-term highway bill has eluded Congress for years, as lawmakers squabble over funding and rely on stopgap patches or two-year extensions.\n\u201cThis is the one area where Barbara and I love each other,\u201d said Mr. Inhofe.\nSEE ALSO: Hillary Clinton tells Americans to face their racismCurrent highway funding is based chiefly on the federal 18.4 cents-per-gallon gas tax \u2014 25 cents for diesel \u2014 and levies on heavy trucks."}
