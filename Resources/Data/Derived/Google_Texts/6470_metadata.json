And he has a better idea.\n\n\u201c[I]f you\u2019re trying to reach these so-called Young Invincibles who think they don\u2019t need insurance, with what kinds of people do you reach them?\u201d Tomasky asks. \u201cSimple: People more invincible than they are. So, how about an athletic white guy holding his snowboard? A strong-looking Latina woman cradling a soccer ball? A strapping young black male gripping a basketball \u2014 no; not a basketball, liberalism, a goddamn football! Et cetera. And a headline with something like: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m healthy. But I bought insurance anyway.'\u201d\n\nSounds interesting, but as Number Two had to keep reminding Dr. Evil, that already happened.\n\nThe Obama administration has made repeated efforts to tie the Affordable Care Act to the manly world of sport, with expensive and embarrassing results. The Department of Health and Human Services tried to get promotion from the National Basketball Association, while Covered California got L.A. Clippers point guard Chris Paul to promote the new law at an event sponsored by Kaiser Permanente.\n\n\u201cWe can reach young adults,\u201d Paul told CBS in Los Angeles at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re with kids all day, every day, and they\u2019re watching our games, and we have an influence, so we have an opportunity to use our voice.\u201d\n\nHHS also reached out for help from the National Football League, but was rebuffed. But the Baltimore Ravens participated in Obamacare promotion for a small price.
