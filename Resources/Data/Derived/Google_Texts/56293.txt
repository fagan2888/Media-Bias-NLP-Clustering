A panel of Wichita area politicians answered questions from a crowd of people in Haysville, sometimes inciting heckling.

The panel of politicians answered questions on clean energy, education funding, voter registration laws and more.

"It's absolutely important to hear from everyone. Especially with people who sometimes I disagree, and that is what is important about these forums is that it give citizens the opportunity to look their legislature in the eye, face-to-face, and demand answers and that is a good process," said Rep. John Carmichael (D) of the 92nd district.

"Some of the forums in the past have been two hours of the folks talking and not being able to exchange ideas. So I like this format because it gives a good take, its a conversation," said Rep. John Whitmer (R) of the 93rd District.

Rep. Carmichael and Rep. Whitmer were the most outspoken at the forum. Carmichael's comments on his disapproval of the voter registration laws and his explanation on how his business is not being taxed under the Governor Brownback's economic plan is part of the financial problem the state is in received cheers from the audience. Meanwhile, Rep. Whitmer defending the voter registration law, citing how it is not uncommon to present government identification when using credit cards or flying on a commercial jet, caused the representative to be booed, with audience members yelling at him that he was wrong.

This was the first time in awhile that Haysville had a forum.

One audience member said that she was glad the politicians came to speak, but feels that the ideas and questions presented by the audience will largely go ignored.

"The ideas that are accepted are the only ones flying. The others are not allowed in the room and so it will go pretty much as it would have, even it they would have never been here," said forum attendee Vernette Chance.

There might be more forums in March and April.
