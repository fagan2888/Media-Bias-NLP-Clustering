Democrats argued it went too far.\n\n>>> Read More: The Conservative Problem With No Child Left Behind\n\nConservatives\u2019 biggest issue with the legislation is that it failed to offer states an option to completely opt out of the 80-some programs under the No Child Left Behind law, which was re-authorized and renamed (from the Elementary and Secondary Education Act) in 2001 under President George W. Bush.\n\n\u201cThis proposal spends nearly as much as No Child Left Behind, is nearly as long in page length, and fails to give states an option to opt out of the law,\u201d Burke said of the House proposal.\n\nInstead, conservatives would like to see the Academic Partnerships Lead Us to Success (A-PLUS) amendment added to the No Child Left Behind rewrite.\n\nThe A-PLUS proposal would provide states that did not want to participate in No Child Left Behind a way out.\n\nRep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., and Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., led the effort this week to pressure Republican leadership to include the 10-page A-PLUS proposal in the Student Success Act.\n\nAlthough conservatives effectively stopped the Student Success Act from moving forward, Walker told The Daily Signal it\u2019s not necessarily a \u201cwin.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t view this as a win\u2014a win would be bringing a bill to the House floor with a more open amendment process and passing smart, conservative education reform,\u201d said Walker, adding:\n\nI believe government is at its best and has higher accountability when it\u2019s managed on the state and local levels. H.R. 5 has some good reforms but it should do more.\n\n>>> Commentary: Student Success Act Does Not Repeal Common Core. States Must Do More.\n\nEarlier this week, the Obama administration threatened to veto the Student Success Act without the A-PLUS amendment, calling it \u201cdevastating\u201d for low-income families and students with disabilities. It is therefore unlikely that Obama would sign into law any No Child Left Behind update that includes A-PLUS.\n\nStill, conservatives so far refuse to endorse any legislation that does not further their policy beliefs about education.\n\nRepublicans did not say when the House would consider another No Child Left Behind rewrite.", "article_metadata": {"description": "After failing to win the support of conservatives, Republicans have quietly withdrawn legislation that would update the No Child Left Behind law.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "After failing to win the support of conservatives, Republicans have quietly withdrawn legislation that would update the No Child Left Behind law.", "title": "Amidst Conservative Backlash, House Pulls No Child Left Behind", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericastwelve180115.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-02-27T18:24:25+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1ASp6Da"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "After failing to win the support of conservatives, Republicans have quietly withdrawn legislation that would update the No Child Left Behind law.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericastwelve180115.jpg"}, "title": "Amidst Conservative Backlash, House Pulls No Child Left Behind", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Education", "tag": "k-12,school choice", "published_time": "2015-02-27T17:11:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-27T18:24:25+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "nclb, no child left behind, nclb reauthorization, student success act, HR 5, mark walker"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf079\"", "article_summary": "Republicans did not say when the House would consider another No Child Left Behind rewrite.\nIt is therefore unlikely that Obama would sign into law any No Child Left Behind update that includes A-PLUS.\nThe A-PLUS proposal would provide states that did not want to participate in No Child Left Behind a way out.\nThe bill, called the Student Success Act, was strongly opposed by both conservatives and Democrats.\n>>> Commentary: Student Success Act Does Not Repeal Common Core."}
