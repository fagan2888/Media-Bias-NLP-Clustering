Richard Drew/Associated Press\n\nALBANY \u2013 Partisan tussles here have stalled rent-control laws and tax policies as the legislative session draws to a close, but one bill has really gone to the dogs.\n\nA bill permitting people to dine at restaurants with pooches passed through both chambers of the Legislature Tuesday morning with bipartisan support.\n\nIntroduced earlier this year, the bill only pertains to outdoor dining areas, and it gives restaurant owners the option to ban the practice.\n\n\u201cI think this is a win for dogs, because they don\u2019t have to sit at home without their owners,\u201d said Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, the Manhattan Democrat who introduced the bill earlier this year.\n\nThe bill was not without some controversy. Some officials from New York City expressed concerns because the legislation overrides city health codes. And the legislation was amended at one point to respond to concerns it could weaken laws pertaining to service dogs.\n\nBut the the bill sailed through the Senate earlier this week, with sponsorship from Sen. Kemp Hannon, a Long Island Republican, and passed in the Assembly on Tuesday, where Ms. Rosenthal sponsored it.\n\nShe said she has no plans to push for dogs to eat inside restaurants with their owners: \u201cI think outside is sufficient.\u201d\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has yet to take a stance on the outdoor dining rights of dogs.\n\nRichard Azzopardi, a spokesman for the governor, said: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to review this legislation, however, the Governor has a strong record of increasing rights and protections for all New Yorkers, four-legged or otherwise.\u201d\n\nOther issues in Albany, meanwhile, continued to prove contentious. New York City\u2019s rent regulations expired on Monday, provoking the ire of Democrats and tenant-advocates, after the Legislature\u2019s two chambers failed to reach an agreement on renewing them.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Sen. Marty Golden, a Brooklyn Republican, said the issue was still being discussed, as the clock ticked on the legislative session, which is set to end Wednesday. Asked if lawmakers might leave Albany without renewing the rent laws, Mr. Golden said he doubts it but did not know.\n\nMs. Rosenthal attributed the bipartisan appeal of her bill to a shared concern for dogs among Albany\u2019s lawmakers. \u201cAnimal issues are nonpartisan,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause animals have no voice, you have to be their voice.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "Partisan tussles here have stalled rent-control laws and tax policies as the legislative session draws to a close, but one bill has really gone to the dogs.", "title": "Bill Allowing Dogs in Outdoor Dining Areas Passes in Albany", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/06/16/bill-allowing-dogs-in-outdoor-dining-areas-passes-in-albany/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IY253_NYDOG0_P_20150616123541.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Bill Allowing Dogs in Outdoor Dining Areas Passes in Albany", "description": "Partisan tussles here have stalled rent-control laws and tax policies as the legislative session draws to a close, but one bill has really gone to the dogs.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Mike Vilensky", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "Partisan tussles here have stalled rent-control laws and tax policies as the legislative session draws to a close, but one bill has really gone to the dogs.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2015-06-16T17:18:47-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-159", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/06/16/bill-allowing-dogs-in-outdoor-dining-areas-passes-in-albany/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-23243", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Partisan tussles here have stalled rent-control laws and tax policies as the legislative session draws to a close, but one bill has really gone to the dogs.", "title": "Bill Allowing Dogs in Outdoor Dining Areas Passes in Albany", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2015/06/16/bill-allowing-dogs-in-outdoor-dining-areas-passes-in-albany/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-IY253_NYDOG0_P_20150616123541.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-23243", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2015-06-16T17:27:45-04:00"}, "article_summary": "Introduced earlier this year, the bill only pertains to outdoor dining areas, and it gives restaurant owners the option to ban the practice.\nAndrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has yet to take a stance on the outdoor dining rights of dogs.\nMs. Rosenthal attributed the bipartisan appeal of her bill to a shared concern for dogs among Albany\u2019s lawmakers.\nAnd the legislation was amended at one point to respond to concerns it could weaken laws pertaining to service dogs.\nMarni Turner, and her 10-year-old poodle, \u201cDougie,\u201d visit at an outdoor cafe on New York\u2019s Upper West Side in May."}
