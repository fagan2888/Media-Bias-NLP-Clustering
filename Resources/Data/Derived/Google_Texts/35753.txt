Under Trump's tax plan, no business of "any size" will pay more than 15 percent of their business income in taxes. He has also vowed to repeal the estate tax, which taxes transferred property post-death, something critics say hurts small companies, according to DonaldJTrump.com. Trump's personal income plan has four bracketsâ€”0 percent, 10 percent, 20 percent and 25 percent. And Trump said on CNBC Thursday he would be "getting rid a tremendous amount of regulation."



Clinton has spoken about enacting tax reform that is friendlier to small businesses, and also vows to cut red tape at "every level of government," according to HillaryClinton.com.
