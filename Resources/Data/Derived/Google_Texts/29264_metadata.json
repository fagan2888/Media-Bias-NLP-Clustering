Mr. Obama was asked if he understood why some Americans are fearful about the direction in which he has led the country.\u201cIf you are referring to specific strains in the Republican Party that suggest that somehow I\u2019m different, I\u2019m Muslim, I\u2019m disloyal to the country, etc., which unfortunately is pretty far out there and gets some traction in certain pockets of the Republican Party, and that have been articulated by some of their elected officials, what I\u2019d say there is that that\u2019s probably pretty specific to me and who I am and my background, and that in some ways I may represent change that worries them.\u201dMr. Obama accused Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump of exploiting anger and fear over economic insecurities among working class White men to propel his presidential campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be the potential for anger, frustration, fear\u2014some of it justified but just misdirected. I think somebody like Mr. Trump\u2019s taking advantage of that. That\u2019s what he\u2019s been exploiting during the course of his campaign.\u201dThe very successes of the first Black president over the span of his first seven years in office may be the source of even more frustration for right-wingers and race haters. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the American experience,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cPick any decade and this question\u2019s been wrestled with. This has been true since the founding.\u201dThe perception of Mr. Obama\u2019s performance is also compounded among Black observers because he\u2019s never been the openly \u201cBrother President.\u201d It\u2019s very difficult to grade him, \u201cbecause President Obama is merely the chairman of the board of the executive committee of the U.S. ruling elite,\u201d Dr. Gerald Horne, who holds the Moore\u2019s chair of History and African American Studies at the University of Houston, told The Final Call.\u201cAnyone who\u2019s chaired a meeting knows, you either express the will of the body or you resign, or you\u2019re ousted. So it\u2019s difficult to evaluate President Obama, apart from an evaluation of the ultimate rulers of the United States of America.\u201dDr. Wilmer Leon, a political scientist and host of \u201cInside the Issues,\u201d heard on Sirius-XM Satellite Radio agrees. \u201cFor 2015, I guess, I\u2019d give him a \u2018B,\u2019 overall I\u2019d give him a \u2018C-plus\u2019 up through this point of his administration,\u201d Dr. Leon told The Final Call.However, \u201cif I were evaluating him strictly as an African American and looking at the needs of the African American community, the grades would be much different. I\u2019ve had to recalibrate my assessment, because he\u2019s the president of the United States, he\u2019s a functionary of the United States government.\u201dDespite the obstacles in his path from a unified Republican opposition which set out from Inauguration Day 2009 to cause this president to fail, Mr. Obama was able to notch several victories. \u201cHe got substantive things done that were very heavy lifts and very much in opposition to conservative interests,\u201d Dr. Leon continued, \u201cone being the deal with Cuba where he has reopened the embassy with Cuba. He is in the process of normalizing relations with Cuba. I think the Iran nuclear deal is another very, very big accomplishment.\u201cThe reason I think those things are significant is because there was and there continues to be incredible opposition from conservatives, from the Republican Party. He did something he normally doesn\u2019t do, which is (to) stand tough against opposition, articulate clearly why what he\u2019s trying to accomplish is important and in spite of those headwinds, he leaned into those headwinds and got it done.\u201dProgressive analysts universally praise the normalization with Cuba and the Iran nuclear deal, even when they have nothing else good to say about the Obama presidency. \u201cThere have been some extremely positive developments from the Obama administration, and that is the Iran nuclear deal and the Cuba opening,\u201d Medea Benjamin, co-founder of Code Pink Voices for Peace said in an interview. \u201cThese were both done despite tremendous opposition, especially around Iran, and Obama pushed forward, so on that I think we should be very thankful.\u201d\u201cI would rate him highly with regard to his approach to Cuba,\u201d said Dr. Horne, \u201cand with regard to the nuclear deal with Iran; with regard to climate change which is one of the most pressing issues on planet earth right now. So, overall, I would give him a mixed evaluation.\u201dVeteran political analyst and statistician Dr. David Bositis had mostly good things to say if he had to evaluate the Obama presidency. \u201cPretty good grades, a lot of positive things this year,\u201d Dr. Bositis told The Final Call. \u201cThe agreement with Iran, the opening up with Cuba. The economy still has some problems, but on the other hand it is continuing to grow.\u201cThe unemployment rate is going down. Starting on January 1st there will be a lot of increases in the minimum wage. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion and a lot of movement, which Obama has been a part of adjusting the criminal justice process. The climate change agreement was a big deal. So there have been a lot of positive things,\u201d said Dr. Bositis.\u201cAlso, the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and people who were formerly uninsured are continuing to get insurance. He was able to withstand court challenges to the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Dr. Leon added.But with the rise of fear in Washington and other Western capitals over barbaric acts committed in the name of the Islamic State\u2014or ISIS, or ISIL, of Da\u2019esh\u2014Mr. Obama\u2019s approval ratings have descended quickly.\u201cOh, I would grade him as a \u2018C-minus,\u2019 particularly because I focus a lot on foreign policy issues,\u201d said Ms. Benjamin, \u201cand we\u2019re still at war, perpetually. His whole administration has been war after war, and now we\u2019re getting deeper into the wars he was supposed to have gotten us out of.\u201dBut instead of succumbing to right-wing rhetoric which seeks a U.S. military solution to each and every international crisis, Mr. Obama should follow another course, according to Ms. Benjamin. \u201cI wish we would maybe use Jeremy Corbin, the head of the Labor Party in the U.K. as our barometer for what a good politician\u2019s position would be.\u201cHe has constantly been of the opinion that the presence of foreign troops in the Middle East is a cause of continued violence, and there will never be an end to the wars as long as foreign military presence exists. So, if you look at the Obama administration\u2019s record: he said he was going to get us out of Afghanistan, and then decided \u2018No, can\u2019t leave there, 10,000 remaining troops; he\u2019s been fighting a war with Pakistan, low-key with drones; Libya war has been a disaster, absolute chaos there; Yemen, one (conflict) he said was a good example of U.S. military involvement, now, not only is there al-Qaeda, and ISIS in Yemen, but the good friend of ours, Saudis, are creating a humanitarian disaster in the whole country; Somalia seems to be a disaster with U.S. intervention; Iraq, well you know, who needs to talk about that; so that we destroyed that country; and then Syria; so, seven countries that Obama\u2019s administration has been involved in militarily, and all (are) in terrible shape,\u201d she said.The Middle East quagmire is not going to be solved soon by any U.S. political leader, according to Dr. Bositis. \u201cThere is ISIS, but the fact of the matter is that (neither) Obama, nor any other political leader is going to control what happens in the short term, in Syria. It will eventually play itself out. It\u2019s looking more and more like all the parties are getting bled.\u201cObama was elected and promised when he was elected, that he was not going to be George Bush,\u201d Dr. Bositis continued. \u201cAnd so, by and large, he\u2019s fulfilled that promise of not being George Bush. He\u2019s raised taxes on the wealthy. Under his watch, the economy has clearly turned around from being the catastrophe it was in the spring of 2009 to where it is now.\u201cFrom initial missteps on foreign policy matters, I think on balance, he\u2019s been more of a plus than he\u2019s been a minus. We can point to a number of things that he\u2019s done that have been positive things,\u201d he continued. \u201cRemember, ever since Obama was elected president, the Republicans have opposed everything he has wanted to do. They have not supported him. Listen to the Republican candidates, what\u2019s wrong with the United States, what\u2019s wrong with the world, it\u2019s Barack Obama,\u201d they say.It appears that Mr. Obama\u2019s last year in office will be a trying time. \u201cIt appears as though 2016, with the rise of quote-unquote \u2018terrorism\u2019 he could very well get consumed with what\u2019s happening in Syria,\u201d according to Dr. Leon, \u201cwhat\u2019s happening in Mali and some of the other African countries, not to mention this increase in domestic terrorism, so he could very well be consumed by terrorism in 2016.\u201d\u201cI think Obama\u2019s a reluctant warrior,\u201d said Code Pink\u2019s Medea Benjamin. \u201cI think he doesn\u2019t have the strength to really come out forcefully and say that the crisis in the Middle East dates back to the illegal mobilization of Iraq; that getting the U.S. military out of the Middle East is the best thing that can be done; that we need to put pressure on our ally Turkey to stop the recruits, and the money and the oil going back and forth to ISIS; and put pressure on our friends the Saudis\u2014and I would say cut those friendly Saudi ties\u2014so that we can actually move toward a policy in the Middle East where we\u2019re not hypocrites, supporting the very country, Saudi Arabia that\u2019s the source of so much of this extremism. \u201cWill he do that? Unfortunately not.\u201d\u201cThere are always things that could happen that are unexpected,\u201d Dr. Bositis predicted. \u201cA war breaks out someplace, or something major breaks out someplace. A member of the Supreme Court retires or dies, there are things that could come up that we don\u2019t know right now that are going to happen or not.\u201cIn terms of his overall agenda, by the time a president gets into his eighth year, he\u2019s not going to be undertaking any real new or major initiatives,\u201d Dr. Bositis said. \u201cMy guess is he\u2019s going to be defending, whether vetoing bills or encouraging others to support those positions.\u201cI think he\u2019ll continue to talk out about the criminal justice system. I think he\u2019ll continue to talk about voting rights and some of the problems that happen with voting rights. I also suspect in terms of the bully pulpit, he\u2019ll be a little bit less constrained in his last year in terms of talking about some of the things that have been important to him, but in terms of any big new initiatives, I don\u2019t see that happening. On the other hand, like I said, things can happen. In terms of his reacting to the things that happen, that\u2019s another story since we don\u2019t know what those things might be.\u201dThe president\u2019s final year in office may be dictated by the behavior of his Republican opponents, and the political process to choose his successor. Indeed, the so-called \u201cTrump factor\u201d in the 2016 campaign has breathed new life into the Ku Klux Klan, according to published reports.In fact, a recent TIME magazine article said Mr. Trump\u2019s words have been used as an \u201coutreach tool\u201d for KKK recruiters.Indeed, the same rhetoric that frightens Mr. Trump\u2019s critics draws praise from supporters such as former Louisiana politician and KKK Grand Wizard David Duke.Mr. Duke told The Washington Post that while he has not officially endorsed Mr. Trump, he considers the candidate to be the \u201cbest of the lot\u201d at the moment. \u201cI think a lot of what he says resonates with me,\u201d Mr. Duke said.\u201cThe ultimate answer is, if this right wing cabal is to be confronted, you have to have leadership capable of mobilizing constituencies against it,\u201d said Dr. Horne, \u201cand President Obama has not done that. Now once again you could say he has not done that because he was apprehensive about how the right wing cabal would respond to our mobilization. After all, in previous decades they plunged the nation into Civil War, leading to the slaughter of thousands when they saw it being mobilized.\u201dSo, what to expect from the White House in 2016 \u201cis a very difficult question to answer,\u201d Dr. Horne concluded.\u201cWell, one can only hope. One can hope that given the fact that he has only 12 months left in his term, and given the fact that there is a tendency as the example of Jimmy Carter suggests, for U.S. presidents to become more progressive once they are losing the reins of power.\u201cSo one can hope that he will move in a more progressive direction in 2016, but the problem is of course, once again this right wing rebellion from the White grassroots, as symbolized by Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. It\u2019s a very dangerous phenomenon. It does not bode well. One of the things we know thus far about President Obama, is that not only he, but many of the liberals that back him, are very reluctant to take head-on this White-right. And that does not bode well, even after Obama leaves office.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "presidency, obama, last year,", "description": "New America Media is a nationwide association of over 3000 ethnic media organizations representing the development of a more inclusive journalism.
