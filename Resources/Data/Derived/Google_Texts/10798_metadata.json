He\u2019s the star of his very own patriotic coloring book. He\u2019s a Republican senator from Texas. He is running for president like he\u2019s a televangelist. He is a bad roommate. He is not a fan of the show True Blood, but he is a huge fan of The Simpsons.\n\nOn Thursday, The Daily Beast\u2019s Washington bureau chief Will Rahn joined Sen. Cruz on a radio show hosted by Ben Domenech, publisher of The Federalist. The three discussed video games, Cruz\u2019s efforts to derail ObamaCare, and why Cruz thinks he is so disliked by his Senate colleagues. They also touched on The Simpsons, for whatever reason. The senator proceeded to list his top-two Simpsons episodes, and then enthusiastically quote his favorite lines of dialogue from each of them.\n\nHis all-time favorite episode is \u201c\u2018Round Springfield,\u201d from 1995, in which jazz saxophonist Bleeding Gums Murphy (a minor character) dies. The episode coined the phrase \u201ccheese-eating surrender monkeys\u201d to mock the French; the phrase has since taken on a political life of its own in post-9/11 America.\n\nCruz\u2019s second most cherished Simpsons episode is \u201cTreehouse of Horror VII,\u201d which first aired in 1996. The Halloween episode includes a segment in which tyrannical space aliens named Kang and Kodos abduct Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, and then assume their form in order to run for president and take over the world. Cruz\u2019s favorite line is uttered by the alien Clinton, who tells an excited debate audience that America must continue \u201ctwirling towards freedom!\u201d Here\u2019s the clip:\n\nCruz enjoys The Simpsons enough that he used a clip of Homer Simpson booing the Internal Revenue Service in order to call for abolishing the IRS on Tax Day last year:", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "swin24"}, "keywords": "The Simpsons, Republican Party, u.s. poli, Ted Cruz, television", "publicationDate": 201504162315, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "news_keywords": "The Simpsons, Republican Party, US Politics, Ted Cruz, Television", "pageNum": 1, "title": "Ted Cruzs Favorite Simpsons Episodes", "tags": "entity:tvshow/the_simpsons,entity:organization/republican_party,topic:politics,entity:person/ted_cruz,entity:product/television", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "Republican senator and Presidential candidate Ted Cruz plays TV critic and opines about his favorite \u2018Simpsons\u2019 episodes.", "title": "Ted Cruz\u2019s Favorite \u2018Simpsons\u2019 Episodes", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/16/ted-cruz-s-favorite-simpsons-episodes.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/16/ted-cruz-s-favorite-simpsons-episodes/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1429225882655.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "description": "Republican senator and Presidential candidate Ted Cruz plays TV critic and opines about his favorite \u2018Simpsons\u2019 episodes.", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Asawin Suebsaeng", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-04-16T23:15:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/asawin-suebsaenghtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/16/ted-cruz-s-favorite-simpsons-episodes", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"Ted Cruz\u2019s Favorite \u2018Simpsons\u2019 Episodes\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/16/ted-cruz-s-favorite-simpsons-episodes.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/16/ted-cruz-s-favorite-simpsons-episodes/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47640862.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/04/16/ted-cruz-s-favorite-simpsons-episodes\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-04-16T23:15:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Asawin Suebsaeng\",\"tags\":[\"the_simpsons\",\"republican_party\",\"politics\",\"ted_cruz\",\"television\"]}", "authorIds": "/etc/authors/a/asawin-suebsaeng", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "article_summary": "D\u2019ohRepublican senator and Presidential candidate Ted Cruz plays TV critic and opines about his favorite \u2018Simpsons\u2019 episodes.\nCruz\u2019s second most cherished Simpsons episode is \u201cTreehouse of Horror VII,\u201d which first aired in 1996.\nHis all-time favorite episode is \u201c\u2018Round Springfield,\u201d from 1995, in which jazz saxophonist Bleeding Gums Murphy (a minor character) dies.\nThe senator proceeded to list his top-two Simpsons episodes, and then enthusiastically quote his favorite lines of dialogue from each of them.\nHe is not a fan of the show True Blood, but he is a huge fan of The Simpsons."}
