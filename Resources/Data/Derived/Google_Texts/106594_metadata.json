(NYSE: FLO) is buying bread baking company Dave\u0092s Killer Bread from the founding Dahl Family and Goode Partners LLC for $275 million in cash.\n\nMilwaukie, Oregon-based Dave\u0092s, founded in 1955, is known for making 17 varieties of whole-grain and organic bread. The target is anticipating 2016 sales of up to $170 million. Dave\u0092s will remain an independent of subsidiary of Flowers after the acquisition closes by year\u0092s end. Thomasville, Georgia-based Flowers is funding the acquisition with cash on hand and debt. New York-based Goode Partners acquired a 50 percent stake in Dave\u0092s in January 2013.\n\n\"This is a well-positioned, fast growing company with excellent brand equity and an on-trend organic portfolio that appeals to today's consumers,\u0094 says Flowers\u0092 CEO Allen Shiver.\n\nHealthy food companies continue to attract buyer interest as they try to meet consumer demand for healthier food options. For instance, WhiteWave Foods Co. (NYSE: WWAV) is buying privately-held yogurt maker Wallaby Yogurt Company Inc. in a $125 million cash deal and closed the $550 million acquisition of protein powder maker Sequel Naturals Ltd. from VMG Partners, on August 1.\n\nFor more on M&A trends in the healthy food space read Snack Time.\n\nDeutsche Bank AG (USA) (NYSE: DB) and Jones Day LLP are advising Flowers.
