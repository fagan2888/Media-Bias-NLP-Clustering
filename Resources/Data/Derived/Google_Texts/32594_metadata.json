CC By 2.0\n\nAlthough some see invasive technology as a rough spot in the evolution of medicine, scientific prognosticators worry about the expanding array of implantable devices--nano and bio--entering the human body.\n\nIn the era of Jules Verne\u2019s fantastical stories about submarines and trips to the moon, J. A. McWilliam first reported experiments in 1899 on the application of electrical pulses to the human heart, finding that an external stimulus could evoke steady, clocklike contractions of the pulmonary muscle. A few generations later, in the era of Ray Bradbury\u2019s dystopian vision of an authoritative future, the artificial pacemaker entered the body, an automated machine controlling the heartbeat. Arne Larsson received the world\u2019s first implantable pacemaker in 1958 in Solna, Sweden, a device connected to electrodes delivering the steady pulse.\n\nNow, contemporary medical science in the early 21st century resembles a creation of the late Gene Roddenberry, creator of Star Trek, as once natural body functions are relegated to technology. As high-tech implantable devices become medical reality, some analysts worry that the future will resemble the plot to the 1966 science fiction classic, Fantastic Voyage, in which a global war is waged by miniaturized explorers entering the human body. Except wireless technology subsumes the need for science fiction; external hackers armed with computers could take control of these devices, compromising not only a person\u2019s medical privacy but their bodily integrity, too.\n\nSadie Creese, director of the Global Centre for Cyber Security Capacity at the Oxford Martin School at the University of Oxford, says people may become vulnerable to nefarious forces such as hackers or a computer virus.\n\n\u201cI think the future of chronic disease control will be implanted devices,\u201d she told attendees at FutureFest, a conference held in London this month. \u201cThey will be measuring vital signs, reaching back to the health care providers, whoever that might be and wherever they\u2019re based. So you can imagine consultants and doctors around the world, or your local doctor, firing up a single app and being able to receive alerts on a patient.\u201d\n\nThis month, former Vice President Dick Cheney told 60 Minutes he feared for his life after receiving a pacemaker implant in 2007, directing his doctors to disable its wireless capability to prevent a possible cyber assassination attempt. \u201cI was aware of the danger, if you will, that existed,\u201d he said.\n\nIn response, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reiterated its stance on the safety of medical devices, implanted in 3 million Americans. The government \u201cis not aware of any patient injuries or deaths associated with these incidents,\u201d officials said.\n\nAt the meeting in London, social psychologist Bertolt Meyer demonstrated the potential for what may someday become known as a body hack, allowing a fellow speaker to control his bionic hand using an iPhone app connected by bluetooth. \u201cMy hand comes with an iPhone app,\u201d he said, as reported by The Conversation. \u201cThere is an app for that. This gives the word hacking an entirely new dimension because if someone hacked my phone they could hack my hand.\u201d\n\nAlthough bionic hands and other body parts remain exceedingly rare, hackers might conceivably attack present systems delivering insulin to diabetics, Myers said. An overdose of insulin could easily put a person in shock, and could potentially kill. Like a drone pilot in Nevada dropping bombs on a target in Afghanistan, someone might exercise the power to take life remotely, by hijacking a medical system intended to save life.\n\nMostly hypothetical for now, the number and scale of artificial devices creeping into the human body is advancing, Creese said. \u201cThe truth of the matter is, it\u2019s kind of already here but mainly for significant conditions,\u201d she said. \u201cGive it five to ten years and we\u2019ll all be wandering around with devices.\u201d\n\nCreese said members of the public should begin to discuss the implications of advancing medical technology, before it\u2019s too late.\n\n\u201cWhen we think about cyborg futures, be that healthcare or play, we need to get on top of how we make this citizen centric and how we achieve a fair relationship between people and commerce. In understanding that relationship we\u2019ll understand cyber-security,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, Creese doubts the average man or woman will express much concern until later in the technological evolution, some years ahead. \u201cI think that the real change and the real concern will come from the general population when more people start to feel pain,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s the lights going out or no one being able to go to hospital one day or whether that\u2019s not being able to get on the Internet for the whole weekend. People have different pain thresholds but in general I think when more people start to feel pain from cyber-attacks there will be a change in the public consciousness.\u201d\n\nBy then, cyber-security won\u2019t be just a matter for world governments or international corporations but something felt on a much more personal level, Creese said.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "body hack, medical implants, medical nanotechnology, medical cyber-attack, medical hacking", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Some worry that expanding use of medical implants and other technologies may expose the human body to cyber-attacks.", "title": "Body Hacking: Do Implantable Medical Devices Make Humans Susceptible To Cyber-Attacks?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/body-hacking-do-implantable-medical-devices-make-humans-susceptible-cyber-attacks-260395", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/20/body-hack-will-medical-technology-make-us-vulnerable-cyber-attack.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some worry that expanding use of medical implants and other technologies may expose the human body to cyber-attacks.", "title": "Body Hacking: Do Implantable Medical Devices Make Humans Susceptible To Cyber-Attacks?", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/body-hacking-do-implantable-medical-devices-make-humans-susceptible-cyber-attacks-260395", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/20/body-hack-will-medical-technology-make-us-vulnerable-cyber-attack.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/10/20/body-hack-will-medical-technology-make-us-vulnerable-cyber-attack.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Science/Tech", "published_time": "2013-10-20T16:18:39-04:00", "modified_time": "2013-10-20T16:18:38-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Some worry that expanding use of medical implants and other technologies may expose the human body to cyber-attacks."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda49c\"", "article_summary": "In response, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reiterated its stance on the safety of medical devices, implanted in 3 million Americans.\nMostly hypothetical for now, the number and scale of artificial devices creeping into the human body is advancing, Creese said.\nSome futurists at a conference in London this month worry that expanding use of medical implants and other devices may expose the human body to nefarious forces.\n\u201cGive it five to ten years and we\u2019ll all be wandering around with devices.\u201dCreese said members of the public should begin to discuss the implications of advancing medical technology, before it\u2019s too late.\nCC By 2.0Although some see invasive technology as a rough spot in the evolution of medicine, scientific prognosticators worry about the expanding array of implantable devices--nano and bio--entering the human body."}
