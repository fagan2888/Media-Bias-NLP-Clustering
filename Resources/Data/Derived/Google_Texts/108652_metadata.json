She made a splash in May with an ad where she promised to \u201cunload\u201d on Obamacare; the ad showed her firing a handgun at a shooting range, as the narrator says that \u201cJoni doesn\u2019t miss much.\u201d Also in May, The Des Moines Register reported that Ernst had brought a gun into Iowa\u2019s capital before it was outlawed. The NRA gave her an \u2018A\u2019 rating and endorsed her for her opposition of universal background checks and ban on lead ammunition. In a GOP primary debate, Ernst described the death of seven people at the University of California Santa Barbara as an \u201cunfortunate accident\u201d and that \u201cbecause of a horrible, horrible tragedy, I don\u2019t believe we should be infringing upon peoples\u2019 Second Amendment rights.\u201d\n\nAt the time of Ernst\u2019s speech, the NRA and other gun lobbyists were pushing the conspiracy theory that a universal background checks bill was a ruse to allow the government to confiscate guns and declare marshal law. Following the Newtown shooting, the director of Gun Owners of America warned that Americans should be prepared to take on the government with guns. The NRA also suggested that black people needed guns to protect themselves from the government. Several lawmakers also took up the line, which even led to specific language in the bill banning gun registries. The bill still failed.\n\nThe Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence gave Iowa a C- for its gun laws. Iowa does not prohibit owning assault weapons or limit the number of guns that a person can purchase at one time. In addition, the state does not require the registration of firearms or background checks by unlicensed dealers. Iowa residents must get permits for hand guns; both open and concealed carry of hand guns is legal if the owner has a permit. Open carry for long guns is legal without a permit.\n\nThe Iowa senate race is still considered a toss-up; Ernst is currently leading the Democratic nominee Bruce Braley 48 to 46 percent according to a poll released today.\n\nAmelia Rosch is an intern for ThinkProgress.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "The remarks come from an NRA event held just a little over a month after the movie theater shooting in Aurora, CO.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "The remarks come from an NRA event held just a little over a month after the movie theater shooting in Aurora, CO.", "title": "Joni Ernst Reserves The Right To Use Her Gun To Defend Herself Against The Government", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/10/23/3583433/joni-ernst-guns/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP92323185278-e1414072298710.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The remarks come from an NRA event held just a little over a month after the movie theater shooting in Aurora, CO.", "creator": "@lifesarosch", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP92323185278-321x214.jpg", "title": "Joni Ernst Reserves The Right To Use Her Gun To Defend Herself Against The Government", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP92323185278-e1414072298710.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AP92323185278-e1414072298710.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-23T11:46:47+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe28db\"", "article_summary": "Politics Joni Ernst Reserves The Right To Use Her Gun To Defend Herself Against The Government CREDIT: Ap Images - Justin Hayworth Iowa senate candidate Joni ErnstIn a newly released video from a 2012 National Rifle Association event, Iowa Republican senate candidate Joni Ernst said that she would use a gun to defend herself from the government.\nThe Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence gave Iowa a C- for its gun laws.\nThe Iowa senate race is still considered a toss-up; Ernst is currently leading the Democratic nominee Bruce Braley 48 to 46 percent according to a poll released today.\nSeveral lawmakers also took up the line, which even led to specific language in the bill banning gun registries.\nFollowing the Newtown shooting, the director of Gun Owners of America warned that Americans should be prepared to take on the government with guns."}
