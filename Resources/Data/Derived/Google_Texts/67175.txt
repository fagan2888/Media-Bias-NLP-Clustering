BEECH GROVE, Ind. (WISH) — Police said a man was arrested Thursday morning after he set his ex-girlfriend’s car on fire and led officers on a pursuit.

Police dispatchers with IMPD said at 6:47 a.m., officers started following a stolen vehicle near 13th Street and Southern Avenue in Beech Grove. A few minutes later, a vehicle pursuit began.

Police said Jordan Smith, 23, went westbound on Troy Avenue. Once he passed Keystone Avenue, the vehicle began passing other cars.

The pursuit lasted for a few minutes. At Troy and Shelby, the vehicle lost control, hit a utility pole and knocked over a traffic light. The car then caught fire and soon became completely engulfed in flames.

Officers took Smith into custody. An ambulance was called to the scene, though it wasn’t immediately clear if he suffered any injuries.

Police said the victim, Erica Brenton, 20, told officers that Smith, who is her ex-boyfriend, came to the home, set a rag on fire and put it in her gas tank, then left.
