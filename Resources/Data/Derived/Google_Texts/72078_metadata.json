California's previous health care reform chapter was focused on preparing for Affordable Care Act implementation.\n\n\"This waiver represents a significant opportunity for the state to build on successful coverage expansion through the ACA, and chart a course for moving forward,\" said Jeremy Cantor, MPH, senior consultant at JSI who contributed to the paper.\n\n\"We drew on knowledge of experiences and initiatives in other states and in California counties to identify how the waiver can advance whole-person care \u2013 potentially transforming and improving the way health care services are delivered to the most vulnerable, leading to improved health while also controlling costs.\"\n\nJSI's paper, published in January, offers a big-picture vision as well as seven specific recommendations categorized under three key levers to arrive at the whole-person care ideal. The three levers are:\n\nIncrease access to effectively coordinated care.\n\nIncrease financial flexibility and capacity for shared risk among Medi-Cal providers and delivery systems.\n\nIncorporate focus on social determinants of health.\n\nThe paper follows JSI's September 2014 report on Opportunities for Whole-Person Care in California, which details a comprehensive approach to addressing vulnerable individuals' health, behavioral health, and social needs in concert rather than in isolation.\n\nRead more about the report: California's 1115 Waiver: An Opportunity to Move from Coverage to Whole-Person Care\n\nContact: Rachel Tobey: 415.400.0003 or Mary-Kathryn Aranda: 617.482.9485\n\nSOURCE John Snow, Inc.", "article_metadata": {"geo.region": "california", "cf_entity_thumbnail_url": "http://content.prnewswire.com/designimages/logo-prn-01_PRN.gif", "geo.placename": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 26", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- New California Waiver Focused on Whole-Person Care has Potential to Support Transformation of...", "author": "John Snow, Inc.", "og": {"url": "http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-california-waiver-focused-on-whole-person-care-has-potential-to-support-transformation-of-safety-net-care-300042337.html", "image": "http://content.prnewswire.com/images/prn_facebook_sharing_logo.jpg", "type": "website", "description": "SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- As California enters its next chapter of safety net health...", "title": "New California Waiver Focused on Whole-Person Care has Potential to Support Transformation of Safety-net Care"}, "Publisher": "PR Newswire", "cf_entity_title": "New California Waiver Focused on Whole-Person Care has Potential to Support Transformation of Safety-net Care", "msvalidate.01": "9D28F7743C790DD88F2D9C7375EF7ED5", "robots": "index, follow", "p": {"domain_verify": "7d052ac42aa9e7505635404745861994"}, "date": "2015-02-26T14:53:00Z", "keywords": "John Snow, Inc., california, U.S. State Policy, Health Care & Hospitals, Health Insurance, Medical Pharmaceuticals", "twitter": {"site": "@PRNewswire", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf1f7\"", "article_summary": "California's previous health care reform chapter was focused on preparing for Affordable Care Act implementation.\nJSI's recently published unique guiding document, California's 1115 Waiver: An Opportunity to Move from Coverage to Whole-Person Care is receiving positive attention from stakeholders across the state.\nJSI's paper, published in January, offers a big-picture vision as well as seven specific recommendations categorized under three key levers to arrive at the whole-person care ideal.\nRead more about the report: California's 1115 Waiver: An Opportunity to Move from Coverage to Whole-Person CareContact: Rachel Tobey: 415.400.0003 or Mary-Kathryn Aranda: 617.482.9485SOURCE John Snow, Inc.\nSAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- As California enters its next chapter of safety net health care reform \u2013 to include caring for an additional 12 million Medi-Cal enrollees \u2013 John Snow, Inc (JSI) is proposing a focus on achieving \"whole-person care.\""}
