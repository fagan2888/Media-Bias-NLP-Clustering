Because of this, offering a wider variety of benefits pays dividends for both employers and employees,\u201d said Todd Katz, executive vice president, Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, at MetLife. \u201cThe study takes this even further, showing that benefits are a strong driver for employee loyalty\u201444% of employees say that having benefits customized to meet their needs would increase their loyalty.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the research shows the ability to personalize benefits selections appeals to employees. Over three quarters (78%) of employees want a greater variety of benefits to choose from and 80% would value benefits customized to individual circumstances and age. And, more than ever, employees are ready to share responsibility for this variety: 60% are willing to bear more of the cost in order to have a choice of benefits that meet their needs.\n\nDespite this heightened employee satisfaction, the study also found a surprising dip in the number of companies that agree with the statement, \u201cvoluntary benefits are a significant part of our company\u2019s benefits strategy,\u201d ending a rising trend seen over the past three years. In 2012, 58% percent of employers cited voluntary benefits as a significant part of their strategy. This number dropped to 50% in 2013.\n\n\u201cThis shift in employer focus is somewhat unexpected. But, rather than a change in strategy, this is likely a result of employers being consumed by health care reform and cost control challenges,\u201d noted Katz. \u201cThe employee satisfaction numbers make it clear that voluntary benefit strategies are paying off for employers and that attention should not be shifted from existing plans. Changing course now may have negative effects on loyalty and productivity in the future.\u201d\n\nThis is especially true since retention continues to be a priority, with 87% of employers reporting that this is a very important benefits objective, according to MetLife. Equally critical is managing benefit budgets, with 88% citing cost control as a very important benefits objective and 80% reporting that optimizing benefits plans to reduce costs is a most important strategy. When making benefits decisions, nearly three-quarters (74%) of employers claim cost is an important consideration.\n\nHowever, cost control and retention objectives do not need to be at odds\u2014voluntary benefits allow employers to offer a wider variety of benefits, addressing employees\u2019 desire for greater choice, without impacting benefits budgets. This is good news to over half of employers, 54%, who plan on maintaining the same benefits budget.\n\n\u201cResults from the study support the value of voluntary benefits and their role in helping businesses meet their objectives,\u201d stated Katz. \u201cThe study found that 40% of employees are looking to their employer for more help in achieving financial security through employee benefits. This is up from 29% last year and illustrates the important role voluntary benefits can play in an overall benefits strategy.\u201d\n\nSee related story: Insurers eye market for supplemental coverage to fill gaps left by Obamacare, employer plans", "article_metadata": {"description": "MetLife\u2019s 12th annual U.S. Employee Benefit Trends Study reveals that employee satisfaction with benefits reached 50% in 2013 \u2013 the highest level since the", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.1", "og": {"site_name": "IFAwebnews.com", "description": "MetLife\u2019s 12th annual U.S. Employee Benefit Trends Study reveals that employee satisfaction with benefits reached 50% in 2013 \u2013 the highest level since the study began over a decade ago.
