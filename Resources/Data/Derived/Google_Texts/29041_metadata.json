Sibley was assigned to the 21st Special Tactics Squadron, Pope Army Airfield, North Carolina.\n\nThe units are part of Air Force Special Operations Command.\n\nAfghan officials in Helmand told The New York Times on Wednesday that the troops were part of a group of Americans who had arrived in Helmand earlier in the week to help Afghan forces plan a counteroffensive against the Taliban in the Musa Qala district of Helmand. Their arrival followed a week of heavy fighting.\n\nApproximately 9,800 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan training and advising Afghan national security forces, as well as conducting a counterterrorism mission.\n\nThat number was originally slated to drop to approximately 5,400 by the end of this year, but that plan was revised in the face of an ongoing threat from the Taliban.\n\nThe U.S. troop presence is currently scheduled to draw down to all but an embassy security force by the end of next year, but administration officials are due to review the pace of the drawdown this fall.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "They were killed when a man in an Afghan uniform opened fire.", "description": "They were killed when a man in an Afghan uniform opened fire.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Kristina Wong", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "They were killed when a man in an Afghan uniform opened fire.", "title": "Pentagon identifies two airmen killed in Afghanistan", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/252076-pentagon-identifies-two-airmen-killed-in-afghanistan", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/getty-2011-12-26-pentagon-2.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-04T05:25-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/252076-pentagon-identifies-two-airmen-killed-in-afghanistan", "dcterms.date": "2015-08-27T08:07-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Kristina Wong", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": "Afghanistan, War in Afghanistan, Afghan National Army, Musa Qala, Military, Helmand Province,,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-27T08:07:53-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T05:25:59-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/defense/252076-pentagon-identifies-two-airmen-killed-in-afghanistan", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "They were killed when a man in an Afghan uniform opened fire.", "card": "summary", "title": "Pentagon identifies two airmen killed in Afghanistan"}, "dcterms.title": "Pentagon identifies two airmen killed in Afghanistan"}, "article_summary": "Sibley was assigned to the 21st Special Tactics Squadron, Pope Army Airfield, North Carolina.\nThe Pentagon on Thursday announced the names of the two U.S. service members killed in Afghanistan earlier this week supporting Operation Freedom's Sentinel.\nRoland was assigned to the 23rd Special Tactics Squadron, Hurlburt Field, Florida.\nThe units are part of Air Force Special Operations Command.\nForrest B.
