That solution already looks doomed.\n\nFighting in eastern Ukraine is now fiercer than ever in some locations, NATO\u2019s top commander in Europe, U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, said Thursday in Brussels. He added that weapons systems seen now in the region have in the past heralded a fresh incursion by Russian troops.\n\nThe United Nations Security Council condemned the killings \u201cin the strongest terms\u201d and \u201cunderlined the need to conduct an objective investigation and bring perpetrators of this reprehensible act to justice.\u201d\n\nIn a statement approved by all 15 members, the council also welcomed Wednesday\u2019s new peace initiative and underlined the need to fully implement a September cease-fire agreement.\n\nIt is far from clear who fired Thursday\u2019s deadly mortars and both sides accused the other.\n\nSeparatist leader Alexander Zakharchenko said the front line will now be pushed back away from the fringes of Donetsk to avoid any similar attacks, which he blamed on Ukrainian troops.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Defense Ministry countered that the stricken area was 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the nearest government position and that artillery that struck was likely launched from within rebel territory.\n\nIn Kiev, President Petro Poroshenko appeared to be holding out hope for a new cease-fire, but said stern retribution would await anybody violating the peace.\n\n\u201cIf the enemy doesn\u2019t want to abide by the cease-fire, if he doesn\u2019t want to put an end to the suffering of peaceful people, Ukrainian villages and town, we will smash them in the teeth,\u201d Poroshenko told a meeting of top defense officials.\n\nRussia has always denied providing arms to separatist forces but Western military officials say the quality of the heavy weapons the rebels have means they could only come from Moscow.\n\nThe shells that fell on Donetsk killed trolleybus passengers and people waiting at a stop nearby. People sobbed as they looked on at the blood-spattered bus and the bodies strewn across the road.\n\nBefore all the bodies could be cleared, rebel militiamen dragged a captive Ukrainian soldier before the angry crowd. Some residents punched and kicked the soldier, who was quickly bundled into a waiting car by rebels as the crowd pursued them.\n\nLater, more than a dozen other Ukrainian soldiers were forced to walk two-by-two to where the residents were killed as people in the crowd screamed \u201cFascists!\u201d and \u201cKillers!\u201dat them.\n\nThe civilian death toll has been mounting steadily in the conflict between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed separatists that the United Nations says has killed more than 4,700 people since April.\n\nThe separatist-run Donetsk News Agency cited unnamed officials as saying the shells were fired from a portable 82-millimeter caliber mortar and that a \u201craiding party\u201d was responsible. That suggested the mortars were launched within the city, as claimed by Ukrainian officials. Zakharchenko, however, later said the shells were fired from a town outside Donetsk.\n\nFighting surged last weekend for control over Donetsk\u2019s war-wracked airport, which Ukrainian forces have all but abandoned after months of bitter battles.\n\nUkraine\u2019s Defense Ministry said six soldiers died in fighting at the Donetsk terminal, part of 10 soldiers killed across eastern Ukraine on Wednesday. Sixteen Ukrainian troops were taken prisoner at the airport -they were then paraded in Donetsk.\n\nNegotiations in Berlin on Wednesday concluded with an agreement to uphold a demarcation line defined in September after peace talks in the Belarusian capital, Minsk. Under the Berlin plan, Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed separatists are to pull back their heavy arms 15 kilometers (9 miles) on either side of the line, though there was no agreement on a withdrawal of troops.\n\nBut the United States, which backs Ukraine, says the separatists\u2019 capture of Donetsk airport already violates that boundary.\n\nSeparatist militias were also pressing to extend their territory northwest of the second largest rebel-held city, Luhansk.\n\nFighting there Thursday centered on a strategic hilltop between the villages of Krymske and Sokilnyky known as Checkpoint 31. An AP reporter in the area saw that rebels had captured the checkpoint, which was coming under sustained artillery fire by Ukrainian forces.\n\nMost homes in rebel-held Sokilnyky showed signs of damage and all the residents have fled to avoid the fighting. Separatist fighters moved between Sokilnyky and Checkpoint 31 by cautiously crawling along the ground.\n\nThe separatists appeared to have a formidable array of arms. An AP reporter on Wednesday saw nine Gvozdika self-propelled howitzers and six anti-tank cannons being deployed toward the area. Rebels also have large numbers of Grad multiple rocket launchers.\n\nThe commander of a rebel unit fighting over Checkpoint 31 reacted angrily to suggestions of any peace deal and said more territorial advances lay ahead.\n\n\u201cNo cease-fire! If they come, they have to die. We\u2019ll push them away,\u201d said the commander, who gave only his nom de guerre, Sever, which is Russian for \u201cnorth.\u201d\n\n__\n\nLeonard reported from Kiev, Ukraine.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Hours after a new peace initiative for Ukraine began taking shape, mortar shells rained down Thursday on the center of the main rebel-held city in the east, killing at least 13 people at a bus stop.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Hours after a new peace initiative for Ukraine began taking shape, mortar shells rained down Thursday on the center of the main rebel-held city in the east, killing at least 13 people at a bus stop.", "title": "Ukraine bus attack kills 13, dashes peace hopes for east", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jan/22/13-killed-in-shelling-of-city-bus-in-east-ukraine/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/22/d14e966d8cb5f2036b0f6a706700bc21.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/01/22/d14e966d8cb5f2036b0f6a706700bc21.jpg", "description": "Hours after a new peace initiative for Ukraine began taking shape, mortar shells rained down Thursday on the center of the main rebel-held city in the east, killing at least 13 people at a bus stop.", "site": "@washtimes", "card": "summary", "title": "Ukraine bus attack kills 13, dashes peace hopes for east"}, "Author": "PETER LEONARD and MSTYSLAV CHERNOV", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web0", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcc95f\"", "article_summary": "SOKILNYKY, Ukraine (AP) - Hours after a new peace initiative for Ukraine began taking shape, mortar shells rained down Thursday on the center of the main rebel-held city in the east, killing at least 13 people at a bus stop.\nSixteen Ukrainian troops were taken prisoner at the airport -they were then paraded in Donetsk.\nBut the United States, which backs Ukraine, says the separatists\u2019 capture of Donetsk airport already violates that boundary.\nSeparatist leader Alexander Zakharchenko said the front line will now be pushed back away from the fringes of Donetsk to avoid any similar attacks, which he blamed on Ukrainian troops.\nHe added that weapons systems seen now in the region have in the past heralded a fresh incursion by Russian troops."}
