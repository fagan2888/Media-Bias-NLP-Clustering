The various sects that lived in peace under the rule of Saddam Hussein, Qadaffi and Assad are butchering one another, and a new group, ISIS, is in the process of creating a new state out of parts of Iraq and Syria.\n\nThe reality in the Middle East stands in vast contradiction to the stage-managed landing of George W. Bush on the U.S. aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln, where Bush declared, \u201cMission accomplished,\u201d on May 1, 2003. The mission that Washington accomplished was to wreck the Middle East and the lives of millions of people and to destroy America\u2019s reputation in the process. Thanks to the demonic neoconservative Bush regime, today America is regarded by the rest of the world as the greatest threat to world peace.\n\nThe Clinton regime\u2019s attack on Serbia in 1998 set the pattern. Bush upped the ante with Washington\u2019s naked aggression against Afghanistan, which Washington clothed in Orwellian language-\u2013\u201cOperation Enduring Freedom.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWashington brought ruin, not freedom, to Afghanistan. After 13 years of blowing up the country, Washington is now withdrawing, the \u201csuperpower\u201d having been defeated by a few thousand lightly armed Taliban, but leaving a wasteland behind for which Washington will accept no responsibility.\n\nAnother source of endless Middle East turmoil is Israel, whose theft of Palestine is Washington-enabled. In the middle of Israel\u2019s latest attack on civilians in Gaza, the U.S. Congress passed resolutions in support of Israel\u2019s war crimes and voted hundreds of millions of dollars to pay for Israel\u2019s ammunition. Here we witness Great Moral America 100% in support of unambiguous war crimes against essentially defenseless people.\n\nWhen Israel murders women and children, Washington calls it \u201cIsrael\u2019s right to defend their own country\u201d\u2014a country that Israel stole from Palestinians\u2014but when Palestinians retaliate Washington calls it \u201cterrorism.\u201d By supporting Israel, declared to be a terrorist state by a few moral governments that still exist and accused of war crimes by the UN general secretary, Washington is in violation of its own laws against supporting terrorist states.\n\nRussia\n\nAs horrific as Washington\u2019s recklessness toward the Middle East is, Washington\u2019s recklessness toward Russia is many orders of magnitude greater. Washington has convinced nuclear-armed Russia that Washington is planning a nuclear first strike. In response, Russia is beefing up its nuclear forces and testing U.S. air defense reactions.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine a more irresponsible act than to convince Russia that Washington intends to hit Russia with a preemptive first strike.\n\nOne of Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s advisers has explained to the Russian media Washington\u2019s first strike intentions, and a member of the Russian Duma has made a documented presentation of Washington\u2019s first strike intentions.\n\nChina\n\nThe Chinese are fully aware that their nation faces the same threat from Washington, D.C. warmongers. China\u2019s response to Washington\u2019s war plans against China was to try to demonstrate how China\u2019s nuclear forces would be used in response to Washington\u2019s attack on China, and that America should beware.\n\nChina made this public, hoping to create opposition among Americans to Washington\u2019s war plans against China. Like Russia, China is a rising country that does not need war in order to succeed.\n\nU.S. Needs War\n\nThe only country on Earth that needs war is Washington, and that is because Washington\u2019s goal is the neoconservative one of exercising hegemony over the world.\n\nPrior to the Bush and Obama regimes, every previous U.S. president went to great efforts to avoid telegraphing any nuclear threat. U.S. war doctrine was careful to keep nuclear weapons limited to retaliation in the event the U.S. suffered a nuclear attack. The purpose of nuclear forces was to prevent the use of such weapons. The reckless George W. Bush regime elevated nuclear weapons to preemptive first use, thus destroying the constraint placed on the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe overriding purpose of the Reagan administration was to end the Cold War and, thereby, the threat of nuclear war. The George W. Bush regime, together with the Obama regime\u2019s demonization of Russia, have overturned Reagan\u2019s unique achievement and made nuclear war likely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncompetent Regime\n\nWhen the incompetent Obama regime decided to overthrow the democratically elected government in Ukraine and install a puppet government of Washington\u2019s choosing, the Obama State Department, run by neoconservative ideologues, forgot that the eastern and southern portions of Ukraine consist of former Russian provinces that were attached to the Ukraine Soviet Socialist Republic by Communist Party leaders when Ukraine and Russia were part of the same country\u2014the Soviet Union.\n\nWhen the Russophobic stooges that Washington installed in Kiev demonstrated in word and deed their hostility to Ukraine\u2019s Russian population, the former Russian provinces declared their desire to return to mother Russia. This is not surprising, nor is it something that can be blamed on Russia.\n\nCrimea succeeded in returning to Russia, where Crimea resided since the 1700s, but Putin, hoping to defuse the propaganda war that Washington was mounting against him, did not accept the pleas from the other former Russian provinces. Consequently, Washington\u2019s stooges in Kiev felt free to attack the protesting provinces and have been following the Israeli policy of attacking civilian populations, civilian\n\nresidences and civilian infrastructure.\n\nThe presstitute Western media ignored the facts and accused Russia of invading and annexing parts of Ukraine. This lie is comparable to the lies that Secretary of State Colin Powell told the UN about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction in behalf of the criminal Bush regime, lies that Powell later apologized for to no avail, as Iraq had been destroyed by his lies.\n\nU.S. and NATO military dignitaries and the Pentagon chief are issuing Russia threat warnings based on alleged but non-existent Russian troop buildups on Ukraine\u2019s border. According to the Western ministry of propaganda, if Russia defends the Russian populations in Ukraine from military attack from Washington\u2019s stooge government in Kiev, it is proof that Russia is the villain.\n\nWashington\u2019s propaganda campaign has succeeded in turning Russia into a threat. Polls show that 69% of Americans now regard Russia as a threat, and that the confidence of Russians in American leadership has vanished.\n\nRussians and their government observe the identical demonization of their country and their leader as they observed of Iraq and Saddam, of Libya and Qaddafi, of Syria and Assad, and of Afghanistan and the Taliban just prior to military assaults on these countries by the West. For a Russian, the safest conclusion from the evidence is that Washington intends war on Russia.\n\nWithout Precedent\n\nIt is my opinion that the irresponsibility and recklessness of the Obama regime is without precedent. Never before has the U.S. government or the government of any nuclear power gone to such great efforts to convince another nuclear power that that power was being set up for attack. It is difficult to imagine a more provocative act that more endangers life on Earth. Indeed, the White House fool has doubled up, convincing both Russia and China that Washington is planning a preemptive first strike on both.\n\nRepublicans want to sue or to impeach Obama over relatively inconsequential issues, such as Obamacare. Why don\u2019t Republicans want to impeach Obama over such a critical issue as subjecting the world to the risk of nuclear Armageddon?\n\nThe answer is that the Republicans are as crazed as the Democrats. Their leaders, such as Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), are determined that \u201cwe stand up to the Russians!\u201d Wherever one looks in American politics one sees crazed people, psychopaths and sociopaths who should not be in political office.\n\nGreatest Threat\n\nWashington long ago gave up diplomacy. Washington relies on force and intimidation. The U.S. government is utterly devoid of judgment. This is why polls show that the rest of the world regards the U.S. government as the greatest threat to world peace. On Aug. 8, Handelsblatt, Germany\u2019s Wall Street Journal wrote in a signed editorial by the publisher:\n\nThe American tendency to move from verbal escalation to military escalation\u2014the isolation, demonization, and attacking of enemies\u2014has not proven effective. The last successful major military action the U.S. conducted was the Normandy landing [in 1944]. Everything else\u2014Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan\u2014was a clear failure. Moving NATO units toward the Polish border with Russia and thinking about arming Ukraine is a continuation of relying on military means in the absence of diplomacy.\n\nWashington\u2019s puppet states\u2014all of Europe, Japan, Canada and Australia\u2014enable Washington\u2019s unrivaled danger to the world by their support of Washington\u2019s agenda of exercising hegemony over the entire world.\n\nThe 100th anniversary of World War I is upon us and the folly that caused this war is being repeated. WWI destroyed a civilized Western world, and it was the work of a mere handful of scheming people.\n\nAs Stephen Starr has pointed out on my website, if merely 10% of the nuclear weapons in the U.S. and Russian arsenals are used, life on Earth terminates.\n\nWhen has Washington told you anything that was not a lie? Washington\u2019s lies have caused millions of casualties. Do you want to be a casualty of Washington\u2019s lies?\n\nDo you believe that Washington\u2019s lies and propaganda about the Malaysian airliner and Ukraine are worth risking life on Earth? Who is so gullible that he cannot recognize that Washington\u2019s lies about Ukraine are like Washington\u2019s lies about Hussein\u2019s weapons of mass destruction, Iranian nukes and Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons?\n\nDo you think that the neoconservative influence that prevails in Washington, regardless of the political party in office, is too dangerous to be tolerated?\n\nDr. Paul Craig Roberts was Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy and associate editor of The Wall Street Journal.
