Medical experts had yet to figure out what exactly was causing the outbreak and how the disease was spreading. Also, the treatment options were limited and mostly ineffective. People were rightfully scared.\n\nAs a result, those diagnosed with HIV or AIDS were frequently shunned by family members, fired by employers and evicted from their homes by landlords. To avoid these negative consequences, many people choose not to be tested. This alarmed medical experts. How can you battle a dangerous outbreak if those who are afflicted aren\u2019t identified?\n\nWith time, further research proved that HIV/AIDS doesn\u2019t spread by casual contact. Rather, the virus is transmitted by contact with blood or other body fluids of an infected person. This most commonly occurs through unprotected sex or sharing needles for drug injections. Persons with HIV/AIDS did not pose imminent danger to others, including relatives, friends, co-workers, or neighbors. Research also provided better treatment options that allow HIV/AIDS patients to live longer and healthier lives.\n\nArmed with these new facts, disability advocates successfully lobbied Congress to pass new laws, or amend existing legislation, to better protect those afflicted with various diseases, including HIV/AIDS. They also sought to end blatant discrimination against those with HIV/AIDS, to encourage testing, and to ensure treatment for all persons afflicted with HIV/AIDS. These laws include:\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act. This law guarantees equal opportunity for persons with disabilities, including those with HIV/AIDS, in public housing, employment, transportation, state and local government services and telecommunications. State licensing agencies and occupational schools such a barbering, massage therapy, and home health care assistance, can\u2019t discriminate against a person with HIV or AIDS. Private companies that provide public accommodations, such as restaurants, hotels, theaters, doctors\u2019 and dentists\u2019 offices, hospitals, retail stores, health clubs, museums, libraries, private schools and daycare centers, also fall under ADA requirements. Individuals with HIV/AIDS must have an equal opportunity to use and enjoy their goods, services and facilities.\n\nThis law guarantees equal opportunity for persons with disabilities, including those with HIV/AIDS, in public housing, employment, transportation, state and local government services and telecommunications.

Federal agencies are prohibited from discriminating against persons with disabilities, including HIV/AIDS. The law requires affirmative action in the hiring, retention and promoting of qualified people with disabilities in federal government employment. These requirements extend to covered federal contractors and subcontractors and to programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance.\n\nFederal agencies are prohibited from discriminating against persons with disabilities, including HIV/AIDS.

Family and Medical Leave Act. This law provides eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year for a variety of health reasons, including HIV/AIDS. The employee\u2019s group health care coverage must continue under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had not taken leave.\n\nThis law provides eligible employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave per year for a variety of health reasons, including HIV/AIDS.

This law seeks to protect individuals\u2019 medical information from commercial use, personal gain or malicious harm. To accomplish this goal, HIPAA has four parts: allows individuals with pre-existing conditions to obtain health insurance; standardizes procedures for handling patients\u2019 sensitive health-related information including claims, enrollment, eligibility and payment; establishes national standards for protecting a patient\u2019s privacy; and strictly limits access to sensitive information.\n\nThis law seeks to protect individuals\u2019 medical information from commercial use, personal gain or malicious harm.

Affordable Care Act. Better known as Obamacare, this landmark legislation, passed in 2010, brought sweeping and controversial changes to health care. Key provisions include health care coverage for persons with pre-existing conditions such as HIV/AIDS, broader Medicaid eligibility, more affordable coverage and lower prescription drug costs for Medicare recipients. The ACA is seen as one of the most important laws in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\nBetter known as Obamacare, this landmark legislation, passed in 2010, brought sweeping and controversial changes to health care.

This act provides grants to states and territories to improve the quality, availability and organization of HIV/AIDS health care and support services. With funds from this program, those individuals with HIV/AIDs who don\u2019t qualify for MIP, Medicare or Medicaid, can receive free treatment as Public Health.\n\nThose readers who wish to obtain more information about these various laws and HIV/AIDS related programs and services can contact the following resources:\n\nGuam Public Health and Social Services STD/HIV program at 735-3603/4;\n\nGuam Alternative Lifestyle Association at 969-5483; or\n\nWestCare Pacific Islands/GUAHAN Program at 472-0219\n\nAs a united and informed community, we can effectively combat HIV/AIDS and humanely assist those afflicted with the virus.\n\nBill Pesch is a family law attorney with the Guam Family Law Office in Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a.
