Paul Ryan (R-WI) questions Marilyn Tavenner, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, during a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on \"Affordable Care Act Implementation\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, October 29, 2013.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas (UNITED STATES - Tags: POLITICS HEALTH) - RTX14SQY\n\n4125603\n\nAn observation: The American left is very unhappy when conservatives or liberals play against type.\n\nThis is true when it comes to immigration, poverty, gay rights\u2026you name it. When conservatives start creeping onto their turf \u2014 or when fellow liberals stray from party orthodoxy \u2014 a warning shot is quickly fired. (Every once in a while, of course, a movement has to humiliate and punish one of its own, just to send a message.)\n\nIn the case of conservative interlopers, turned victims, we do not suffer from a paucity of examples. When Sarah Palin first bounded onto the national scene, for example, it was clear she posed an existential threat to the party that had just pushed aside Hillary Clinton. No stone was left unturned in their quest to bring Palin down. It wouldn\u2019t do to have a conservative woman messing on the \u201cwar on women\u201d narrative, after all.\n\nThe most vicious beanings are reserved for those deemed traitors to their class, sex, or race. (Black conservatives often suffer a similar fate, for similar reasons).\n\nBut the defensiveness isn\u2019t relegated solely to identity politics. It\u2019s about encroaching on substance, too. Rep. Paul Ryan has been recently talking about inner-city poverty. And for having the courage to discuss some very real systemic problems, Ryan has been accused of racism.\n\nNo good deed goes unpunished, I suppose, but the racist charge is especially pernicious. Of course, it was really about sending a message to \u201cstay off our turf.\u201d\n\nIn baseball parlance, this is called \u201cchin music\u201d \u2014 a pitch aimed to send a message, and deter the batter from crowding the plate.\n\nRyan was digging in too much \u2014 getting too close to the other guy\u2019s turf.\n\nAnd so they threw at his head.\n\nWe have arrived at a point where a white Republican who talks about poverty is labeled a racist. The goal is to disincentivize white Republicans from even talking about such things \u2014 in order to preserve the status quo.\n\nOf course, Ryan was essentially just continuing a conversation liberal Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan had begun 50 years ago, when he had the courage to warn that the welfare state might be breaking up the family unit, harming black families, and increasing urban poverty.\n\nFor daring to speak the truth and help solve the problem, even Moynihan was accused of being \u201csomething of a racist.\u201d\n\nEvery once in a while, you\u2019ve got to throw at one of your own players.\n\nSomething similar is taking place right now with liberal Ezra Klein, who is being labeled something of a homophobe. Okay, it\u2019s not to that level\u2026yet \u2014 but he is clearly being told that, when it comes to staffing up his new online venture, Vox, he had better get in line.\n\nHis decision to hire \u201cgay anti-gay apologist\u201d Brandon Ambrosino seems to have sparked the outrage. As the American Prospect notes, \u201cKlein has come under fire for the lack of racial and gender diversity among Vox\u2019s announced hires, and his decision to hire Ambrosino shows how much he has to learn about genuine diversity.\u201d\n\nThe message is simple: Klein can get back in the good graces of polite company if he makes the right hires, going forward.\n\nThey didn\u2019t throw at his head.
