The celebration lasts seven days and focuses on seven principles: unity, self-determination, collective work and responsibility, cooperative economics, purpose, creativity and faith.\n\n\u201cIt is non-heroic, nonreligious. It does not replace anything,\u201d Rice-Allen said. \u201cYou can still celebrate Christmas or Hanukkah. It is simply to enhance the concept of stepping back and gathering your community and making sure you\u2019re leaving everything better than you found it.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s celebration consisted of lighting the traditional kinara, a candelabra, with red, black and green Kwanzaa colored candles.\n\nBack at Brother Jeff\u2019s Cultural Center, 14-year-old Aliyah Fard iced cookies in Kwanzaa colors with her friends.\n\nFard said she grew up celebrating the holiday.\n\n\u201cI like the sense of community about Kwanzaa and getting to meet other people when we come together,\u201d she said.\n\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ehernandez", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Denver\u2019s Five Points neighborhood celebrates Kwanzaa", "title": "Denver\u2019s Five Points neighborhood celebrates Kwanzaa", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/12/28/denvers-five-points-neighborhood-celebrates-kwanzaa/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141228__cd30KWANZZA_HHR_0420p1.jpg", "height": 442}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141228__cd30KWANZZA_HHR_0420p1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-28T18:52:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T03:52:44+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8f95\"", "article_summary": "Beginning in the 1960s, Kwanzaa was created to pull the black community together amid race riots.\n\u201cI like the sense of community about Kwanzaa and getting to meet other people when we come together,\u201d she said.\nBrother Jeff\u2019s Cultural Center in Denver\u2019s Five Points neighborhood was alive with children running from table to table, decorating cookies and making crafts as traditional drums played Sunday evening.\nOn the third day of Kwanzaa, members of the Denver community gathered at various celebrations to honor African-American culture with family, friends and neighbors.\nBack at Brother Jeff\u2019s Cultural Center, 14-year-old Aliyah Fard iced cookies in Kwanzaa colors with her friends."}
