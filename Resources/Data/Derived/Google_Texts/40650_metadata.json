Yet it\u2019s not ObamaCare buyers who are getting gouged.\n\nFor the most part, what consumers have to pay is calculated based on their income.\n\nThey don\u2019t pay the sticker price. It\u2019s you \u2014 the taxpayers \u2014 who get taken to the cleaners, because you foot the bill for the subsidies paid directly to the insurers.\n\nThat makes the Supreme Court ruling in King v. Burwell, expected this month, even more consequential. It will determine the fate of these subsidies in 37 states.\n\nWithout subsidies, ObamaCare buyers in those states will have to pay the actual \u2014 and unaffordable \u2014 sticker price of ObamaCare. And you \u2014 taxpayers \u2014 will not have to fork over hundreds of billions of dollars to subsidize insurers over the next decade.\n\nBut the dirty secret is that insurers stand to lose the most from King v. Burwell.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act compels the public to buy their product, and forces taxpayers to subsidize it. What a sweetheart deal.\n\nThe giant players \u2014 United Healthcare, Cigna, Aetna, Anthem and Humana \u2014 have seen stock prices double, triple, even quadruple since the law was passed in 2010. The coming ruling threatens to put an end to their gravy train.\n\nDemocrats are predicting disaster if the court rules against President Obama.\n\nRepublicans will \u201crue the day\u201d they let millions of people lose their subsidies, says Nancy Pelosi. That\u2019s crazy talk.\n\nNo one will lose their coverage immediately, the poor will be unaffected and the biggest losers will be insurance companies.\n\nEmployers, job-seekers and taxpayers actually stand to win here.\n\nIn addition, most Republicans in Congress are inclined to compromise with the president to provide some type of financial help for insurance buyers. If the Supremes gut ObamaCare, there will be many more winners than losers. Here\u2019s how it shakes out:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act says subsidies will be provided only in states that set up their own exchanges. But only a handful of states (including New York) did.\n\nIn 37 states that didn\u2019t, people use the federal healthcare.gov Web site instead. The Obama administration handed out subsidies to these people anyway, playing fast and loose with the law \u2014 and your money.\n\nIf the justices rule that the Obama administration can\u2019t do that, some 7.7 million people will eventually lose their subsidies.\n\nEventually, but not soon.\n\nDuring oral arguments, Justice Samuel Alito suggested that if the court makes such a \u201cdisruptive\u201d ruling, it could delay its taking effect. And Justice Antonin Scalia told the Obama lawyers that \u201cif the consequences are as disastrous as you say,\u201d Congress will come up with a remedy.\n\nInsurance companies are lobbying furiously for a congressional fix.\n\nMeanwhile, outside Washington, DC, a ruling nixing the subsidies will benefit employers and job-seekers.\n\nAny of the 37 states that want to can set up an exchange and immediately qualify for the subsidies. But most are controlled by the GOP and won\u2019t do it.\n\nWithout subsidies, the employer mandate is toothless, because employers are only fined if their uninsured workers go to an exchange and get a subsidy.\n\nEmployers who have been struggling to keep their workforce under 50 (where ObamaCare kicks in) and use part-timers (who aren\u2019t subject to ObamaCare) won\u2019t have to worry any more. Nullifying the employer mandate is likely to ignite a hiring boom.\n\nAccording to the US Chamber of Commerce, that looming mandate has caused 21 percent of small businesses to reduce workers\u2019 hours, 41 percent to delay hiring and 27 percent of franchises (such as fast-food restaurants) to replace full-timers with part-timers.\n\nPeople facing a penalty for being uninsured will also come out ahead. Without subsidies, most will be exempted from the penalty, saving them $2,000 on average next year.\n\nDespite Democrats\u2019 dire warnings, the poor won\u2019t be hurt. An amazing 89 percent of people who are newly insured because of ObamaCare are on Medicaid, which won\u2019t be affected.\n\nIgnore the alarmist rhetoric. A loss for the Obama administration in King v. Burwell will be a win for most Americans.\n\nBetsy McCaughey is a senior fellow at the London Center for Policy Research.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "New York Post", "twitter": {"description": "This week health insurers announced they will hike premiums on ObamaCare plans by double digits in 2016.
