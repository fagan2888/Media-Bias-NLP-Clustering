Leaders say the aftermath of the spill left their people on the brink of economic disaster and threatened their culture.\n\nThe spill sent wastewater cascading into a tributary of the Animas River in Colorado before it emptied into the San Juan in New Mexico. The San Juan runs for 215 miles through the Navajo Nation.\n\nBegaye petitioned this week for help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nBrockovich stepped into the spotlight in the 1990s after she investigated groundwater contamination in a California town while working as a legal clerk. Her work led to a major lawsuit.\n\nJesse Paul: 303-954-1733, jpaul@denverpost.com or twitter.com/JesseAPaul", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Erin Brockovich to tour Navajo Nation in Colorado mine spill\u2019s wake", "title": "Erin Brockovich to tour Navajo Nation in Colorado mine spill\u2019s wake", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/09/04/erin-brockovich-to-tour-navajo-nation-in-colorado-mine-spills-wake/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150828__CD16NAVAJO_BL29206xp1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150828__CD16NAVAJO_BL29206xp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-09-04T10:10:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T17:58:51+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Pollution, Water"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdaab\"", "article_summary": "Erin Brockovich, the famed consumer advocate and environment activist, will tour the Navajo Nation next week to see the effects of last month\u2019s Colorado mine spill.\nThe San Juan runs for 215 miles through the Navajo Nation.\nTribal officials said Brockovich, who was the subject of a 2000 film bearing her name, is slated for a tour Tuesday of the San Juan River with the nation\u2019s president, Russell Begaye.\nThe spill sent wastewater cascading into a tributary of the Animas River in Colorado before it emptied into the San Juan in New Mexico.\n\u201cThe Navajo Nation has been culturally and economically devastated by the impact of the Gold King Mine Spill and we need help to address this crisis,\u201d Begaye said in a statement released Thursday night."}
