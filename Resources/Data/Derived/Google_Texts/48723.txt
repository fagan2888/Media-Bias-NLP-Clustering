A man was killed in a shooting Friday night in Great Bend and a suspect has been arrested.

It happened in the 2400 block of Williams Street around 8:40 p.m. Great Bend Police officers were responding to a call of a shooting. When they arrived, they found a man who appeared to have been shot.

The man was pronounced dead at the scene. The victim's family has identified him as Jeremy Saldana.

Saldana's stepdaughter Marissa Reynolds says it all started with an argument between the two men about the suspect going to the neighborhood park.

"My stepdad came over from the park so that the guy that shot my dad wouldn't shoot up kids at the park," said Reynolds.

Reynolds tells KAKE News the suspect was making threats and wearing a peculiar outfit.

"He was armed with a bullet proof vest on," she said.

That argument turned physical on Reynolds' front lawn between the two men who had never met before last night.

Reynolds says her mother used to be married to Saldana, and the suspect is her mom's current boyfriend.

"The shooter pulled out a gun and shot my dad three times," said Reynolds. "I ran to his body to try to give him CPR, but it didn't work."

Saldana died from the gunshot wounds.

"Why did you have to kill an unarmed man when he did nothing wrong," said Reynolds.

The shooter stayed at the scene until police arrived. He was arrested in connection to the shooting.

"He didn't say anything," said Reynolds. "He didn't even try to run."

Selana's kids are fighting back emotions as they start a memorial by laying bricks where the father of twelve died.

"He was funny, he was kind, everybody who met him really loved him," said Reynolds. "He never did wrong to anybody."

The suspect's name has not been released. Great Bend police say the homicide investigation is ongoing.
