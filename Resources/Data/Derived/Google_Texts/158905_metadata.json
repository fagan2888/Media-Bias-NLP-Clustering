No one is voting for a president \u2014 which isn't to say that Donald Trump won't be written on a lot ballots as a write-in \u2014 but there are still plenty of interesting things to keep an eye on when the returns come in from state and local contests around the country.\n\nThanks to corruption, New York has a handful of special elections.\n\nNew Yorkers aren't supposed to vote for state-level candidates in odd-numbered years, but this tradition depends on elected officials not doing things they aren't supposed to, which appears to be very difficult for the state's leaders. Three legislative seats are up for grabs in scandal-sponsored special elections. As one consultant told The Wall Street Journal, \u201cThis is the jailbird election.\"\n\nSan Francisco goes to war with Airbnb.\n\nProposition F would introduce new regulations to the \"sharing economy\"; it would let Airbnb hosts rent out short-term rentals only 75 nights a year and require hosts to submit new quarterly reports. Airbnb is not happy about this challenge to its growing supremacy \u2014 in the place it calls home, no less \u2014 and has spent $8 million trying to drum up \"no\" votes. Those in favor of the new rules have raised about $1 million.\n\nAirbnb has sometimes been unable to hide its utter antipathy for its city opponents in this battle. The significant amount of money it spent on writing the ad-equivalent of passive-aggressive Post-it notes was perhaps wasted.\n\nThis \u201990s boy-band star thinks Ohio needs more weed.\n\nOhio voters will get to decide if the conservative state is ready for legalized pot today \u2014 and former reality star and teen heartthrob Nick Lachey has been busy telling everyone that he thinks this ballot initiative is just the greatest idea.\n\nHope you\u2019re heading to the polls this tomorrow! If you\u2019re in #Ohio and want to end marijuana prohibition: #NoOn2 #YesOn3. @Yeson3Ohio \u2014 Nick Lachey (@NickLachey) November 3, 2015\n\nLachey and a handful of other people, including descendants of William Howard Taft, could also become the greatest weed barons in Ohio if this initiative passes.\n\nVoters cast their vote at the athletic wing of Orange High School.

The Washington Post writes that \"[w]ithin four years, according to one study, it is estimated that those 10 farms would be selling $1.1 billion worth of pot every year.\"\n\nThe Issue 3 backers are also telling voters to vote against Issue 2, an anti-monopoly initiative that would nullify Issue 3 if approved.\n\nA University of Akron poll from a few weeks ago showed that 46 percent of voters planned on supporting Issue 3, while 46 percent said they planned on voting against it.\n\nVote #YesOn3 to legalize weed in #Ohio this year! Say hi to Buddie! @ResponsibleOH pic.twitter.com/M1BsA9v3cF \u2014 Legalize Now (@OhioMovement) August 26, 2015\n\nDoes Kentucky care enough about Obamacare to keep voting Democratic?\n\nRight now, Democratic attorney general Jack Conway has an ever-so-small lead in the Kentucky gubernatorial race, where voters will have to sort out their priorities: Is it better to elect an outsider or someone who cares about Obamacare?\n\nNearly 10 percent of the state signed up for Medicaid after current Democratic governor Steve Beshear accepted the federal government's expansion money; Republican candidate and self-proclaimed outsider businessman Matt Bevin has said he wants to halt the expansion and get rid of Kynect, the state's health-insurance exchange.\n\nConway, who has been in Kentucky politics for ages, has run far more TV ads than Bevin \u2014 who lost a GOP Senate primary against Mitch McConnell last year \u2014 but has failed to inspire much excitement in his party. Turnout won't be high, and it will be a close election where few people will get to decide whether Kentucky keeps on doing what it's doing \u2014 or decides it's ready for a massive change.\n\nBloomberg's group drops millions into state races in Virginia.\n\nIn Virginia, Michael Bloomberg's gun-violence-prevention group, Everytown for Gun Safety, has spent more than $2 million on ads supporting two Democratic state Senate candidates. The Senate is currently controlled by Republicans and would switch if a Democrat won either of these contests. The National Rifle Association, based in Virginia, has spent about $110,000 on those two races, according to Reuters.\n\nSeattle considers giving voters \u201cdemocracy vouchers\u201d to take power away from big-money donors.\n\nMeanwhile, in a few other states, voters are considering getting rogue money out of elections. Initiative 122 in Seattle would give residents four $25 coupons or \"democracy vouchers\" every election, which they could then \"donate\" to the candidates of their choice. Candidates who took part in this system would face stiff spending caps in city races, and donors and companies would face new spending caps and restrictions. Microsoft and other companies and donors that have enjoyed the perks that come along with being robust election spenders do not like this ballot initiative. In Maine, residents will consider Question 1, which would open up more public campaign financing by getting rid of a few \u201clow-performing, unaccountable\u201d business tax breaks and force outside groups to list their top three donors on ads.\n\nThese former state legislators are begging voters for forgiveness.\n\nRemember that tea-party state legislator who made up a fake rumor accusing himself of being \"a bi-sexual porn addicted sex deviant!\" in order to cover up the colleague he was sharing an office \u2014 and having an affair \u2014 with? Well, Todd Courser and Cindy Gamrat are running for their seats again, despite having respectively resigned or been kicked out of office only a few weeks ago.\n\nAnd there's a chance they could both boomerang right back into politics. Turnout is supposed to be dismally low \u2014 this is an off-off-year election \u2014 and many, many candidates have jumped at the opportunity to fill the scandal-ridden seats. There are 11 candidates on the ballot in Courser's primary, and 8 in Gamrat's. Name recognition will be a boon \u2014 perhaps even if the recognition doesn't bring fuzzy feelings to mind.\n\nCourser posted a 19-minute selfie video this week to finish off his campaign and try to win over his district's very conservative voters. Gamrat told the Detroit News, \u201c\u201cPeople have actually have been very kind and understanding ... I even had someone who said \u2018I voted for Whiteford last time, but I\u2019m voting for you now because of what they did to you in Lansing.\u2019\u201d\n\nWill Mississippi elect a truck driver?\n\nProbably not.\n\nAfter shocking everyone \u2014 including his family, which was unaware he was running \u2014 by winning a Democratic primary earlier this year, it seems unwise to completely discount Robert Gray's campaign. However, most observers seem quite confident that Phil Bryant, who has spent nearly $3 million this year, will win reelection in a landslide. Gray has spent about $3,000 while touring the state and talking about Medicaid and education spending.\n\nReuters reports that \"the main unknown is how quickly media outlets will declare the victors after polls close. 'Will they call it at 7 or 7:01?'\"\n\nIn Louisiana, voters have a few more weeks until their gubernatorial runoff election, a long, strange contest that has included mentions of \"a very serious sin,\" a love child, videos alleging secret affairs, and a newspaper article featuring the quote, \u201cThe stupid son of a bitch was supposed to find Santa Claus in the cafe; that\u2019s the guy with the white beard. But you can tell David Vitter that he doesn\u2019t get anything for Christmas. He\u2019s been naughty.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-TileColor": "#000", "description": "Pot and scandals and Nick Lachey, oh my!", "generator": "the-factory", "og": {"site_name": "Daily Intelligencer", "description": "Pot and scandals and Nick Lachey, oh my!", "title": "8 Important \u2014 or Amusing \u2014 Things to Watch on Election Night 2015", "url": "http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/11/here-are-8-election-day-things-to-watch.html", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/11/03/03-san-francisco-election-prop-f.w1200.h630.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@intelligencer", "image": "http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2015/11/03/03-san-francisco-election-prop-f.w750.h560.2x.jpg", "description": "Pot and scandals and Nick Lachey, oh my!", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Here Are 8 Election Day Things to Watch"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Daily Intelligencer", "fb": {"app_id": 120608177953522}, "msapplication-TileImage": "//cache.nymag.com/media/di/icon.144x144.png", "application-name": "Daily Intelligencer", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "keywords": "elections, election 2015", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/NewYorkMag", "tag": "elections,election 2015", "published_time": "2015-11-03T21:35:00.000Z"}, "topics": "topics-test, elections, election 2015", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no"}, "article_summary": "Meanwhile, in a few other states, voters are considering getting rogue money out of elections.\nThe first Tuesday in November 2015 is a somewhat understated version of Election Day.\nThe Issue 3 backers are also telling voters to vote against Issue 2, an anti-monopoly initiative that would nullify Issue 3 if approved.\nAs one consultant told The Wall Street Journal, \u201cThis is the jailbird election.\"\nMicrosoft and other companies and donors that have enjoyed the perks that come along with being robust election spenders do not like this ballot initiative."}
