Sharapova was beaten by No. 20 Dominika Cibulkova in the match on Rod Laver Arena immediately before Azarenka defeated Sloane Stephens, the last remaining American in the singles draw.\n\nNadal won three tough sets against Kei Nishikori, while Murray wasted four match points in the third set \u2014 including two in the tiebreaker \u2014 before dominating the fourth set against lucky loser Stephane Robert of France.\n\nFour-time Australian Open champion Roger Federer was never threatened in beating 2008 finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 in a late match. He will play Murray in the quarterfinals on Wednesday.\n\nThird-seeded Sharapova, complaining of a hip ailment, lost 3-6, 6-4, 6-1 after struggling with her serve and making 45 unforced errors. She joins Williams on the sidelines after the top-ranked American lost in three sets Sunday to Ana Ivanovic, ending 25-match winning streak.\n\nSharapova had spent the latter months of last year on the sidelines with a right shoulder injury, so she wasn\u2019t expecting much of herself.\n\n\u201cI have to look at the positives and see where I have come from in four or five months,\u201d Sharapova said. \u201cI haven\u2019t played a lot of tennis. \u201c\n\nAzarenka had a 6-3, 6-2 win over No. 13-seeded Stephens, the player who beat Williams in the quarterfinals here last year and then lost to Azarenka in the semifinals under controversial circumstances. Azarenka took a medical time out when Stephens started to gain momentum in that match, then came back to advance to the final and subsequently win her second Australian Open trophy.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t getting carried away Monday with the apparent ease of the draw with Williams and Sharapova gone.\n\n\u201cThe players who beat those players deserve all the credit because they\u2019ve been better, so they are dangerous and they are competitive,\u201d Azarenka said.\n\nAzarenka, who is on an 18-match winning streak at Melbourne Park, will next play No. 5 Agnieszka Radwanska, who beat Spain\u2019s Garbine Muguruza 6-1, 6-3 in the final fourth-round match Monday night.\n\nNadal beat Nishikori 7-6 (3), 7-5, 7-6 (3), though he was broken twice in the third set \u2014 getting a time violation from chair umpire Evanthia Asderaki in one of the games.\n\n\u201cNormally I have a good self-control on court, and it\u2019s true that the moment was a very critical one,\u201d Nadal said of the time violation.\n\nThe 13-time major winner also tripped in the first set and tumbled to the court, then had to go to the locker room to change shoes.\n\nNadal next plays Grigor Dimitrov, who reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam for the first time with a 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 6-4 win over Roberto Bautista Agut.\n\nThree-time Australian Open finalist Murray ended the run of Robert, wasting match points in the third set and smashing his racket after the tiebreaker before advancing 6-1, 6-2, 7-6 (6), 6-2.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fun player to watch, but not a fun player to play,\u201d Murray said of Robert\u2019s assortment of drop shots and deft groundstrokes.\n\nThe racket smashing was pure frustration.\n\n\u201cLosing that set was frustrating because it obviously means you\u2019re out there another 30, 40 minutes at least, when I would preferably had been in the locker room,\u201d Murray said. \u201cMy racket bit the dust. Unfortunate for it.\u201d\n\nMurray said he\u2019s expecting a tough match against Federer, regardless of the Swiss player\u2019s recent drop in the rankings that has seen him seeded sixth here.\n\n\u201cI think last year you could see at periods he was struggling with his back,\u201d Murray said. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s fully fit, I\u2019ve said all along, he\u2019s always going to be there or thereabouts in the majors, and he\u2019ll give himself opportunities to win more because he\u2019s that good.\u201d\n\nFederer lost to Murray in the semifinals last year in five sets after beating Tsonga in five in the quarterfinals.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same draw just one round earlier for me,\u201d Federer said. \u201cI\u2019m happy this time I didn\u2019t play five sets.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, the first of the quarterfinals begin when Ivanovic plays Eugenie Bouchard and two-time Australian Open finalist Li Na takes on Flavia Pennetta.\n\nIn men\u2019s quarterfinals, three-time defending champion Novak Djokovic plays Stanislas Wawrinka and No. 3 David Ferrer takes on No. 7 Tomas Berdych.", "article_metadata": {"description": "On the men's side, top-ranked Rafael Nadal and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray faced tougher-than-expected matches to advance to the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "On the men\u2019s side, top-ranked Rafael Nadal and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray faced tougher-than-expected matches to advance to the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park.", "title": "Australian Open 2014: Maria Sharapova upset as women\u2019s draw busts open", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jan/19/australian-open-2014-maria-sharapova-upset-womens-/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/18/aptopix-australian-open-tennisjpeg-0f8e8.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/01/18/aptopix-australian-open-tennisjpeg-0f8e8.jpg", "description": "On the men's side, top-ranked Rafael Nadal and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray faced tougher-than-expected matches to advance to the quarterfinals at Melbourne Park.", "card": "summary", "title": "Australian Open 2014: Maria Sharapova upset as women\u2019s draw bust"}, "Author": "Dennis Passa", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "Sports, Andrew Murray, Australian Open, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal"}, "article_summary": "Four-time Australian Open champion Roger Federer was never threatened in beating 2008 finalist Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 in a late match.\nMaria Sharapova joined Serena Williams as fourth-round casualties, leaving Azarenka a potentially easier run to the women\u2019s final.\nShe wasn\u2019t getting carried away Monday with the apparent ease of the draw with Williams and Sharapova gone.\n\u201cI\u2019m happy this time I didn\u2019t play five sets.\u201dOn Tuesday, the first of the quarterfinals begin when Ivanovic plays Eugenie Bouchard and two-time Australian Open finalist Li Na takes on Flavia Pennetta.\nThree-time Australian Open finalist Murray ended the run of Robert, wasting match points in the third set and smashing his racket after the tiebreaker before advancing 6-1, 6-2, 7-6 (6), 6-2."}
