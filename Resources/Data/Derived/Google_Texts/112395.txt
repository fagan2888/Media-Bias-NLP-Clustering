ROUGH CUT (NO REPORTER NARRATION) The 107-year-old Hulton Bridge over Pittsburgh's Allegheny River was demolished on Tuesday (January 26). Officials say the bridge was rusty, shaky and had to go. A new Hulton Bridge has been constructed. Crews planned to inspect the new bridge to make sure it did not suffer any damage from the implosion of the old one.
