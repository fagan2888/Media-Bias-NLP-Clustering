(AP) - Most people\u2019s only view of the small town of Terry in eastern Montana is buzzing by on the interstate.\n\nFrom the roadway, traveling at 75 miles per hour, the area surrounding the town looks flat and unremarkable, but those who venture off the interstate will be amazed by the terrain hiding in the Terry Badlands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of our unexplored gems,\u201d said Mark Jacobsen, spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management in Miles City, which manages the badlands.\n\nThe Terry Badlands are located about six miles west of Terry, which is just off Interstate 94 between Miles City and Glendive.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s right off the highway,\u201d Jacobsen said.\n\nThe badlands encompass 44,000 acres of public lands that are designated as a Wilderness Study Area. The area features sedimentary rocks that have eroded over eons into arches, bridges, spires and tabletops.\n\nJacobsen says the scenery at Terry Badlands is more spectacular than the badlands of Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota. And unlike the national park, the Terry Badlands are completely undeveloped.\n\n\u201cTerry Badlands is relatively pristine,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of what makes it so special.\u201d\n\nEdward Gaub, who lives in Terry, has been exploring his backyard badlands for about 25 years.\n\n\u201cI like to go up there and take pictures,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also enjoys taking visitors out to the badlands.\n\n\u201cEverybody that\u2019s seen it is really amazed,\u201d Gaub said. \u201cThere is just beautiful scenery and rock formations and hills.\u201d\n\nHe likes to go into the badlands in the spring to see the wildflowers. He sees wildflowers there that he never sees closer to Terry.\n\nBut no matter what the season, the badlands are always beautiful.\n\n\u201cEach different time of year is a different show,\u201d Gaub said.\n\nWhile beautiful year round, the Terry Badlands aren\u2019t always accessible.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s raining you don\u2019t want to go anywhere near it,\u201d he said.\n\nAccessing the badlands shouldn\u2019t be attempted when the roads are wet because mud can make them impassable.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not gravel roads,\u201d Jacobsen said. \u201cThey\u2019re gumbo. It\u2019s basically bare dirt.\u201d\n\nAfter the spring rains are done and the roads are dry, the badlands usually remain accessible until the end of hunting season.\n\nHiking and horseback riding are popular in the badlands. People can take ATVs in, but must stay on designated routes. Some people also opt to mountain bike in. The area is popular for hunters, as well as wildlife and bird watchers and photographers.\n\nThe land is designated a wilderness study area, which means Congress has identified it as having wilderness characteristics and may some day be considered for wilderness designation.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime, it\u2019s a pristine area,\u201d Jacobsen said. \u201cIt\u2019s set aside by Congress as an area that is remarkable for its wilderness characteristic.\u201d\n\nGetting there\n\nTerry is located just off Interstate 94 between Miles City and Glendive.\n\nThere are two routes to access the badlands from Terry.\n\nState Route 253, which runs from Terry north to Brockway is a Big Sky Back Country Byway. Look for signs for Terry Badlands. That road will lead to a scenic vantage point, with a view of the badlands and the town of Terry.\n\nVisitors also can travel west on Old Highway 10 out of Terry about 1.8 miles to the Milwaukee Road. Turn right and continue about 3.5 miles and cross the Yellowstone River. A kiosk about a half mile past the river gives information about the area and marks the beginning of the Calypso Trail.\n\nThe trail gets its name from an old railroad siding called Calypso from the days the railroad ran through the area.\n\n\u201cAt one point in time there was a school house there,\u201d said Mark Jacobsen, spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management in Miles City, which manages the Terry Badlands. \u201cThere were even a few people that lived there.\u201d\n\nToday, the Calypso Trail is a primitive road, running about 5.5 miles in the Terry Badlands. It will take visitors past a spire called Chimney Rock and ends at a trailhead for the natural bridges.\n\nThe BLM office in Miles City has maps of the area, and people are welcome to stop in or call for directions and information.\n\nDon\u2019t access the Terry Badlands when the roads are wet, as they often become impassable.\n\n___\n\nThe original story can be found on the Great Falls Tribune\u2019s website: http://gftrib.com/1kswJVj\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Great Falls Tribune, http://www.greatfallstribune.com", "article_metadata": {"description": "Most people's only view of the small town of Terry in eastern Montana is buzzing by on the interstate.", "Author": "ERIN MADISON", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "Most people\u2019s only view of the small town of Terry in eastern Montana is buzzing by on the interstate.", "title": "Terry Badlands: unique geology off beaten path", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/jun/21/terry-badlands-unique-geology-off-beaten-path/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/19/e244c46af4938b17570f6a706700ead3.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2014/06/19/e244c46af4938b17570f6a706700ead3.jpg", "title": "Terry Badlands: unique geology off beaten path", "description": "Most people's only view of the small town of Terry in eastern Montana is buzzing by on the interstate.", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web2", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd1490\"", "article_summary": "The Terry Badlands are located about six miles west of Terry, which is just off Interstate 94 between Miles City and Glendive.\nJacobsen says the scenery at Terry Badlands is more spectacular than the badlands of Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota.\nAnd unlike the national park, the Terry Badlands are completely undeveloped.\nDon\u2019t access the Terry Badlands when the roads are wet, as they often become impassable.\n\u201cTerry Badlands is relatively pristine,\u201d he said."}
