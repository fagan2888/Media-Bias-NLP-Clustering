As for his future, Bush told those on the call that he intends to stay active

Washington (CNN) Jeb Bush held a short phone call Wednesday afternoon to thank his supporters, including key financial backers, several participants said.

"He said exactly what I expected him to say -- a very sincere, heartfelt thank you," CNN political commentator and Bush supporter Ana Navarro said on CNN's "The Lead."

This participant said Bush did not talk about whether he might endorse in the future.
