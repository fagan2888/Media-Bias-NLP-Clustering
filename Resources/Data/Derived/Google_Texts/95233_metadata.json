Over 99 percent of drug trials for the disease have failed over the past decade, leaving scientists concerned that there are virtually no new therapies to treat the disease \u2014 despite the fact that the Obama administration has poured funding into fighting it.\n\nThe researchers note that the drug failure rate for Alzheimer\u2019s is much higher than for other diseases like cancer. It\u2019s especially alarming since incidences of Alzheimer\u2019s are growing and will continue to rise significantly as baby boomers age. By 2050, the number of people aged 65 and older with Alzheimer\u2019s disease might triple from five million to up to 16 million, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association.\n\nThe study was led by Dr. Jeffrey Cummings of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health in Las Vegas. It found that between 2002 and 2012, 99.6 percent of drug trials that aimed to prevent, cure, or treat Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms had either failed or been discontinued. In cancer research, meanwhile, there was an 81 percent rate of failure.\n\n\u201cThe authors of the study highlight a worrying decline in the number of clinical trials for Alzheimer\u2019s treatments in more recent years,\u201d Dr. Simon Ridley of Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK told the BBC. \u201cThere is a danger that the high failure rates of trials in the past will discourage pharmaceutical companies from investing in dementia research. The only way we will successfully defeat dementia is to continue with high quality, innovative research, improve links with industry, and increase investment in clinical trials.\u201d\n\nMany times, drugs that appear promising in early-stage studies end up not working out as planned in large-scale trials. Over the past 30 years, researchers have targeted various aspects of the disease, such as beta-amyoid, the main component of the plaques covering the brains of Alzheimer\u2019s patients; tau proteins, a chief part of tangles; inflammation, and insulin resistance. But according to the study, only one drug proved effective: Memantine, which is used to improve memory. Memantine can delay symptoms temporarily, but also causes side effects like headaches, constipation, and dizziness. The Food and Drug Administration has approved several other drugs along with memantine, which can be used to treat Alzheimer\u2019s symptoms. They work to increase neurotransmitters in the brain.\n\nAccording to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, about 50,000 volunteers are \u201curgently\u201d needed to participate in over 100 clinical trials regarding Alzheimer\u2019s and other forms of dementia.\n\nSource: Cummings J, Morstorf T, Zhong K.
