Dave Camp\u2019s (R-Mich.) 979-page tax reform bill. The bill is considered unlikely to become law, but Camp is chairman of the powerful, tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, and his draft legislation is likely to provide a road map for tax reformers in years ahead.\n\nThe tax, as outlined in Section 5206 of the legislation, is called an \u201cexcise tax based on investment income of private colleges and universities.\u201d It begins, \u201cthere is hereby imposed on each applicable institution for the taxable year an excise tax equal to 1 percent of the net investment income of such institution for the taxable year.\u201d\n\nThe draft legislation goes on to make clear that the proposed new tax would apply only to private colleges and universities, not state colleges or universities. So Harvard\u2019s $32 billion endowment would be fair game for the tax collector, but the University of Texas\u2019s $20 billion endowment would remain tax exempt. The proposed tax would also only applies to the richest of the private colleges \u2014 those with endowments of at least $100,000 per full time student. That would exempt private colleges such as Georgetown or George Washington University, which are reportedly not as well endowed on a per student basis.\n\nEven with those carve-outs, however, the tax adds up. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the tax would raise $1.7 billion over the decade from 2014 to 2023. Harvard alone would pay roughly $30 million in tax for a single year in which a $30 billion endowment earned a ten percent return. Yale would pay a $20 million federal tax for a year in which its roughly $20 billion endowment earned a 10 percent return.\n\nThe colleges, naturally, don\u2019t like the idea. The vice president for federal relations at the Association of American Universities, M. Matthew Owens, told InsideHigherEd.com that the provisions were \u201cconcerning\u201d and \u201ctroubling.\u201d\n\nCamp, for his part, makes the case that he\u2019s just giving the college endowments the same treatment as big private foundations such as the Ford or Gates Foundations. Those foundations have to pay a two percent excise tax on their endowment income that can be reduced to one percent if they make grants above a certain minimum threshold.\n\nEven so, it\u2019s easy to think of motives here beyond policy consistency. If policy consistency were the only motive, after all, Republicans would be trying to reduce taxes rather than dreaming up new ones.\n\nMight it have just something to do with the overwhelmingly Democratic-leaning party registration and political contributions on these sorts of college campuses, or the fact that they exist largely in Democrat-leaning states? Camp represents Michigan and is a graduate of Albion College and of the University of San Diego School of Law.\n\nThe idea of a tax on university endowments has attracted support from a variety of somewhat surprising quarters. A senior fellow at the center-right Manhattan Institute, James Manzi, has written supportively about the proposal for National Review Online: \u201cViewed purely in terms of economics, Harvard is really a $40 billion tax-free hedge fund with a very large marketing and PR arm called Harvard University that has the job of raising the investment capital and protecting the fund\u2019s preferential tax treatment.\u201d The left-leaning Reuters blogger Felix Salmon has also written positively about the idea.\n\nI\u2019d prefer the politicians in Washington spend their time figuring out taxes to repeal, rather than inventing new ones to impose. I also cringe at the idea of a tax designed to punish a party\u2019s political opponents. But for conservatives who are tired of hearing President Obama drone on about how he just wants to \u201cask\u201d the \u201crich\u201d to pay a little more to help fund food stamps, ObamaCare, universal pre-school, or whatever the under-attack help-the-poor program of the day is, one can understand the attractiveness of coming back with a proposal to tax Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.\n\nWith his bill, Camp is making the point that the higher education sector has its own one percent, and turnabout is fair play. Nice endowment you\u2019ve got there, the Republicans seem to be saying: It\u2019d be too bad if we have to redistribute it.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://reason.com/archives/2014/03/10/republicans-craft-tax-hike-for-harvard-a", "site_name": "Reason.com", "type": "article", "description": "The GOP should be thinking up ways to cut taxes, not raise them.", "title": "Republicans Craft Tax Hike for Harvard and Yale"}, "twitter": {"site": "@reason", "description": "House Republicans are plotting a $1.7 billion tax increase aimed\nat America\u2019s most elite colleges and universities.\nThe tax increase is buried on page 879 of Rep.
