Just yesterday, President Obama jokingly revealed that he’d like to fix the broken HealthCare.gov website himself, “but I don’t write code.” Last month, it was Microsoft’s Internet Explorer team that tweeted (and then deleted) an offer to help the government fix HealthCare.gov.

Earlier this week, a similar offer came from an even more unusual source: the Syrian Electronic Army. The group does know code: it claims to have hacked into Twitter, the New York Times, the Associated Press and even the Obama campaign email account.

Hey @HealthCareGov, We can fix your website for US people, We have people really can code. #SEA — SyrianElectronicArmy (@Official_SEA16) November 3, 2013

Maybe we should give Kathleen Sebelius a chance to finish that “Websites for Dummies” book first.
