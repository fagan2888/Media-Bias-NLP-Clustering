First, Erika reported that labor unions were out of luck when it comes to getting an exemption from Obamacare, and Ed reminded us that the system is fraught with security problems. Well, the administration will need to keep an eye on how many horses are getting out of the pen, because virtually all Federal Employees would prefer not to be enrolled, thank you very much.\n\nFrom Merrill Matthews at Forbes:\n\nWho knew that when President Obama promised, \u201cIf you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health care plan. Period,\u201d he was only referring to federal employees \u2026 and himself? A new survey of 2,500 federal employees and retirees found that 92.3 percent believe federal workers should keep their current health insurance and not be forced into ObamaCare. Only 2.9 percent say they should become part of the new health insurance exchanges.\n\nYou always need to be cautious with surveys, particularly when you\u2019re trying to hit such a specific demographic slice, but if you manage to ring up a number greater than 90 on one side of the equation you can be pretty sure that you\u2019ve tapped into a significant majority. And Matthews has discovered a particularly biting bit of irony in these numbers which is probably already obvious to the majority of us. The lion\u2019s share of federal workers are all organized in federal employee unions. Weren\u2019t they some of the President\u2019s most vocal and active supporters when this train wreck was being shoved through Congress in the first place?\n\nWhat I\u2019d like to know is how many of those federal employees so eager to avoid ObamaCare themselves supported forcing everyone else in it\u2026 To put it simply: Federal employees and retires almost unanimously prefer to stay in their generous taxpayer-funded health insurance program, known as the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP), rather than being dumped into liberalism\u2019s two greatest monuments to government-run health insurance, ObamaCare and Medicare. Speaks volumes, doesn\u2019t it?\n\nI can\u2019t believe that there isn\u2019t going to be some sort of eleventh hour, ride to the rescue maneuver to absolutely ensure that federal employees won\u2019t face this awful fate. Staying on that fat, taxpayer funded Cadillac plan is the far better option, and Democrats don\u2019t want that many union workers ticked off at them. But whatever the \u201csolution\u201d turns out to be, it won\u2019t come as much comfort to all of the people on private plans who wind up getting forced onto the rolls. That would include workers, retirees and family members from UPS, IBM, Trader Joe\u2019s and others.\n\nBut nobody really wants the GOP to keep trying to stop this bill, right? I mean, that would just be some silly people on the fringe.\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "For thee, but not for me", "title": "Federal workers want everyone on Obamacare except\u2026 federal workers", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2013/09/14/federal-workers-want-everyone-on-obamacare-except-federal-workers/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2013-09-14T21:31:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-09-14T16:07:23+00:00"}, "keywords": "health care, health insurance, ObamaCare, public employee unions, unions,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9558\"", "article_summary": "A new survey of 2,500 federal employees and retirees found that 92.3 percent believe federal workers should keep their current health insurance and not be forced into ObamaCare.\nThe lion\u2019s share of federal workers are all organized in federal employee unions.\nFederal workers want everyone on Obamacare except\u2026 federal workersposted at 5:31 pm on September 14, 2013 by Jazz ShawIt\u2019s really turning out to be an Obamacare kind of weekend, even in the midst of all the Syria news.\nPeriod,\u201d he was only referring to federal employees \u2026 and himself?\nI can\u2019t believe that there isn\u2019t going to be some sort of eleventh hour, ride to the rescue maneuver to absolutely ensure that federal employees won\u2019t face this awful fate."}
