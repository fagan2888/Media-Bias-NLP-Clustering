The average schedule for the diverse efforts GAO looked at actually increased by 2.4 months, \u201cdue in part to the significant delays experienced by a few programs.\u201d The study notes that 13 programs in the existing portfolio reported a schedule change over the past year, 11 of which were delays.\n\nRelated: The F-35 Engine Still Has \u2018Recurring Quality Issues\u2019\n\nHowever, if the \u201ceffect of the Airborne Maritime/Fixed Station radio system\u2019s delay is removed from the analysis, the average schedule increase for 2015 is 1.1 months, similar to what we reported in our last assessment,\u201d according to GAO.\n\nThe report included a recent memo from Nancy Spruill, the Pentagon\u2019s director of acquisition, resources and analysis, stating the department was pleased with GAO\u2019s findings.\n\nThe results \u201cappear to validate our focus on continuous improvement on the cost, schedule and performance measures of our programs through employment of Better Buying Power initiatives,\u201d she wrote, referring to the Pentagon\u2019s ambitious acquisition reform initiative that began in 2010.\n\nRelated: How the Government Spent $86 Million for a Plane That Hasn\u2019t Flown\n\nSpruill refers to a chart showing the Pentagon\u2019s progress on controlling costs but GAO chose not to include it because \"there could be other explanations for this decrease.\"\n\nStill, the watchdog admitted the sprawling department\u2019s reforms efforts may have had something to do with keep program costs in line.\n\nSpecifically, \u201cprograms that started development after the implementation of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 (WSARA) and DOD\u2019s 'Better Buying Power' initiatives began in 2010 have achieved cost reductions or shown less cost growth than those that began development before 2010, indicating that recent reforms may be having a positive effect,\" according to the report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "The U.S. Defense Department is going a better job on controlling cost growth for its major acquisition programs, according to a new watchdog report.", "title": "How the Pentagon\u2019s $1.4 Trillion Weapons Portfolio Got a Little Smaller", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/01/How-Pentagon-s-14-Trillion-Weapons-Portfolio-Got-Little-Smaller", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02062013_Pentagon_Cuts_article.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/04/01/How-Pentagon-s-14-Trillion-Weapons-Portfolio-Got-Little-Smaller", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/articles/02062013_Pentagon_Cuts_article.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The U.S. Defense Department is going a better job on controlling cost growth for its major acquisition programs, according to a new watchdog report.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "The Government Accountability Office says the cost of the Pentagon\u2019s top 79 weapons programs \u2013 with a total value of about $1.44 trillion -- declined by roughly $15 billion since the last review in 2014.\nThe U.S. Defense Department is doing a better job controlling costs for its major acquisition programs, according to a new watchdog report.\n\"Our current assessment shows that DOD is making progress in decreasing the amount of cost growth realized in the portfolio,\" the report states.\nRelated: The 10 Most Expensive Weapons in the Pentagon\u2019s ArsenalThe annual study encompasses such high-profile weapons programs as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the Littoral Combat Ship, and the Ohio-class submarine replacement \u2013 all of which have cost the American taxpayer billions.\nThe report included a recent memo from Nancy Spruill, the Pentagon\u2019s director of acquisition, resources and analysis, stating the department was pleased with GAO\u2019s findings."}
