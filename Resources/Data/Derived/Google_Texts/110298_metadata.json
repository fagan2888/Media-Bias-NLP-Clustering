Don\u2019t believe me? Ask former White House advisor David Axelrod.\n\nSpeaking to an audience at the University of Chicago Institute of Politics during an event promoting the release of his memoirs, Axelrod said that he was perhaps proudest of the fact that the Obama White House has managed to avoid \u201ca major scandal\u201d over the last six years (hat tip to BuzzFeed for this clip):\n\n\u201cI think that in the administration itself and the White House, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true,\u201d when asked by an attendee about the administration\u2019s failure to live up to the president\u2019s stated goal of restoring ethical governance to Washington. \u201cI mean there are exceptions, there have been a few exceptions but the rule has basically been that there has been a ban on the revolving door and these two-year strictures against such revolving door.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m proud of the fact that basically you have had an administration in this place for six years in which there hasn\u2019t been a major scandal,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I think that says a lot about the ethical strictures of this administration.\u201d\n\nI suppose that\u2019s true, so long as you don\u2019t count the Obama White House\u2019s politically-motivated decision in 2012 to assert categorically that the multi-stage Benghazi attack that claimed the life of four Americans including a U.S. ambassador was inspired by a YouTube video. That controversial claim is still the subject of investigations even today.\n\nAnd who would call the Obama Justice Department\u2019s decision to monitor the communications of AP journalists, or the naming of Fox News reporter James Rosen as a \u201cco-conspirator\u201d in a crime in order to track his movements, a scandal?\n\nOh, and it would be poor form to label the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s admitted targeting of politically active conservative groups with burdensome scrutiny scandalous.\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t dare note that the systematic denial of service to American veterans, and the covering up of those infractions, constitutes a full-blown scandal even though it did result in the forced resignation of a Cabinet secretary.\n\nPresumably, few would consider the Department of Energy\u2019s determination to provide millions of dollars in federal loans to dubious technologies produced by well-connected clean energy firms that went bankrupt and defaulted on their obligations to be a \u201cmajor scandal.\u201d Many in the media seem not to recall names like Solyndra, Sapphire Energy, or Abound Solar, so Axelrod must be on to something.\n\nIt would, perhaps, be bad form to note that two administrators with the General Services Administration were fired before that agency\u2019s head also resigned after it was discovered that the better part of $1 million had been spent on a lavish four-day event in Las Vegas for the institution\u2019s 300 employees.\n\nAnd the many who died as a result of the Department of Justice\u2019s botched \u201cgun-walking\u201d program, including American law enforcement personnel, surely do not regard the Fast and Furious program to have been a \u201cmajor scandal.\u201d\n\nOther than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you enjoy the play?\n\nRelated Posts:", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "Hot Air", "description": "Except when it was.", "title": "Take David Axelrod\u2019s word for it: Obama\u2019s White House remains untouched by any \u2018major scandals\u2019", "url": "http://hotair.com/archives/2015/02/17/take-david-axelrods-word-for-it-obamas-white-house-remains-untouched-by-any-major-scandals/", "image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@hotairblog", "card": "summary", "creator": "@JazzShaw"}, "fb": {"admins": 312482775445602, "app_id": 312482775445602}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-02-18T01:01:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-17T22:24:45+00:00"}, "keywords": "Benghazi, David Axelrod, doj scandal, fast and furious, gsa scandal, IRS scandal, Solyndra,", "google-site-verification": "2eqey8dXzgu4RGIRpBp8N_Uha0byt8NWBVajCi3uLgs", "verify-v1": "ouQUGDxtAiO+0Hn3LJajbWMP08yRHQDinMN9QDYrUV4="}, "article_summary": "Ask former White House advisor David Axelrod.\nTake David Axelrod\u2019s word for it: Obama\u2019s White House remains untouched by any \u2018major scandals\u2019posted at 8:01 pm on February 17, 2015 by Noah RothmanBoth President Barack Obama and the administration he leads are ethical paragons.\nOh, and it would be poor form to label the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s admitted targeting of politically active conservative groups with burdensome scrutiny scandalous.\nDon\u2019t believe me?\nThat controversial claim is still the subject of investigations even today."}
