First, we had Jonathan Gruber of MIT calling us “stupid” for not seeing through his financial gimmicks when we were hoodwinked with Obamacare.

Then we had Ben Rhodes talking about how he used deception in getting the Iranian nuclear deal passed.

Finally we had President Obama in a speech at Howard University saying he never intended to be a post-racial President. What happened to “there is no red state or blue state, only red, white and blue states?”

Where is the public outrage at the deception being fostered upon us for the sake of a legacy issue?
