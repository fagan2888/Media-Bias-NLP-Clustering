Speaking on Jake Tapper's program Wednesday afternoon, Borger was asked to respond to the enrollment numbers released by the administration following the first month of healthcare.gov and the several state-run exchanges across the country.

CNN: Obamacare Enrollment Numbers 'Complete Disaster'

The federal health insurance exchange website created by Obamacare has been a complete disaster said CNN analyst Gloria Borger. Speaking on Jake Tapper's program Wednesday afternoon, Borger was asked to respond to the enrollment numbers released by the administration following the first month of healthcare.gov and the several state-run exchanges across the country. A total of 106,185 people signed up for new health insurance plans, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, and only 26,794 people were able enroll through the federal website. Healthcare.gov has been a complete disaster for the administration, said Borger. It's clear they've been lowballing what to expect, and I'm not quite sure they lowballed it enough.
