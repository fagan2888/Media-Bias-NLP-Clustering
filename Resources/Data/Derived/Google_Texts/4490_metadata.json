Chris Ticer. \"This was pretty successful last year, and the people really appreciated it.\"\n\nLean Whitten said it was the first time she had ever been pulled over.\n\n\"It was scary,\" she said. \"I don't know what to expect, he's going to give me a ticket and I'm going to get in trouble! I don't even know what I did.\"\n\nOfficer Alan Hooper told her the reason he pulled her over was because she and her passengers were all buckled up and she used her blinker. Then, he handed her a gift card to an area restaurant.\n\n\"Normally, I'm really scared of them,\" Whitten said.\n\nHowever, this method of spreading holiday spirit makes those like Whitten see officers as friends.\n\n\"We wanted to do something to reward the people that are driving safe out here and doing the right thing.\" said Sgt. Ticer.\n\nOfficers will be handing out gift cards to safe drivers through Christmas.", "article_metadata": {"geo.position": "34.799810;-87.677251", "description": "FLORENCE, Ala.
