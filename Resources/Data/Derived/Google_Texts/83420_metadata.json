The payment should never be made directly to an individual or return preparer.\n\nThe IRS has received several reports of this kind of unscrupulous activity. In some cases, return preparers have told taxpayers to make the payment directly to them, even though the taxpayer had Medicaid or other health coverage and doesn\u2019t need to make the payment at all.\n\nIn some parts of the country, unscrupulous return preparers are targeting taxpayers with limited English proficiency and, in particular, those who primarily speak Spanish.\n\nHow the scam is justified\n\nThese preparers are asking for direct payment to them, but the reasons they give vary. Their methods include:\n\n\u2014 telling individuals that they must make an individual shared responsibility payment directly to the preparer because of their immigration status.\n\n\u2014 promising to lower the payment amount if the client pays it directly to them.\n\n\u2014 demanding money from individuals who are exempt from the individual shared responsibility payment.\n\nCould be taken out of refund\n\nTaxpayers either pay the shared responsibility payment with their tax return or in response to a letter from the IRS requesting payment. They should not make the payment directly to any individual or return preparer.\n\nIf a shared responsibility payment is due, taxpayers should pay it to the U.S. Treasury. In most cases, the shared responsibility payment reduces a taxpayer\u2019s refund. If there is no refund, the payment will increase the amount a taxpayer owes on the tax return.\n\nFind out more about the tax-related provisions of the health care law at www.IRS.gov/aca.\n\nInformation about the payments\n\n\u2014 Payments are not required for individuals who had coverage or qualify for an exemption for each month of the year.\n\n\u2014 Individuals who are not U.S. citizens or nationals, and are not lawfully present in the United States, are exempt from the individual shared responsibility provision and do not need to make a payment. For this purpose, an immigrant with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status is considered not lawfully present and therefore is exempt. An individual may qualify for this exemption even if he or she has a Social Security number (SSN).\n\nTaxpayers who are unsure if they must make a payment can click below for information:\n\nhttp://www.irs.gov/uac/Am-I-required-to-make-an-Individual-Shared-Responsibility-Payment%3F\n\nFind out more about the tax-related provisions of the healthcare law at IRS.gov/aca.\n\nThe Obamacare fines\n\nThe annual individual shared responsibility payment for 2014 is the greater of:\n\n\u2014 1% of your household income that is above the tax return threshold for your filing status, such as \u201cmarried filing jointly\u201d or \u201csingle,\u201d or:\n\n\u2014 A flat dollar amount of $95 per adult and $47.50 per child, limited to a maximum of $285.\n\nThe fines will increase in upcoming years.\n\nReport problems to the IRS\n\nAnyone who thinks they have been targeted by an unscrupulous preparer or been financially affected by a tax return preparer\u2019s misconduct or improper tax preparation practices, can report the situation to the IRS on Form 14157: Complaint \u2014 Tax Return Preparer.\n\nChoose tax preparer carefully\n\nThe vast majority of tax professionals provide honest, high-quality service, according to the IRS press release.
