But this year is a little different because I\u2019m turning 50 in 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s not quite as bad as it seems: I still get carded when I buy wine at Whole Foods, and I\u2019m in pretty good shape, with no chronic health problems and no major physical woes. Still, there\u2019s no denying the significance of this half-century milestone. Fifty is, frankly, a little scary; from here on out it\u2019s all about maintenance.\n\nBut I got a tiny blip of joy from this Canadian report that shows the number of centenarians (at least those living in Ontario) increased over 70 percent in the last 15 years. Women are leading the trend, researchers report, \u201cmaking up more than 85 percent of people over 100.\u201d\n\nSo, I face the next 50 years with some hope: At Thanksgiving, a 93-year-old relative of mine (who is now dating a 100-year-old man; they met at the 92nd Street Y in New York, apparently the meat market of the centenarian set) told me, \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying my 90s.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s more from the Canadian study, published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society, via news release:", "article_metadata": {"description": "A study out of Canada found the number of centenarians (at least those living in Ontario) increased over 70 percent in the last 15 years.
