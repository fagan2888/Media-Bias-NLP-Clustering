(Nasdaq: JOUT) agreed to buy Seabear Gmbh, which makes smart watches and other underwater equipment for scuba divers.\n\nMinneapolis private equity firm Norwest has made several consumer investments over the years, including: archery equipment-group Bowtech; reading-glasses seller Eyebobs; health care and pharmacy business Apothecary Products; sports-product line Shock Doctor, which it sold to Bregal Partners in 2014; language-learning service Rosetta Stone; carpet distributor Stanton Carpet; and mattress business Select Comfort.\n\nNorwest, in April, raised a $1.6 billion buyout fund and an $800 million mezzanine fund. The buyout fund, Norwest Equity Partners X LP, will invest $30 million to $250 million per deal, and the mezzanine fund will expend between $20 million and $75 million per transaction.\n\nAs consumer interest in healthy and active living continues, lifestyle brands keep inspiring transaction activity. Before the Johnson's acquisition, Saban Brands picked up surf brand Piping Hot, and Bruckmann Rosser Sherrill & Co. added race-car products maker Simpson Performance Products Inc.
