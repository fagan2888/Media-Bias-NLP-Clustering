Though President Obama can still veto what Congress produces, Republicans want to prove they can dismantle Obamacare with a simple Senate majority and a GOP president in 2017.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s get this bill to the president\u2019s desk and let him make a decision. Is he going to finally stand up for American workers and sign this bill? Or is he going to continue to support a law that\u2019s destroying jobs and destroying health care in this country?\u201d said Majority Whip Steve Scalise, Louisiana Republican.\n\nDemocrats complained it was the 61st time that House Republicans scheduled a vote to scrap all or part of Obamacare while Congress struggles to meet deadlines on the nation\u2019s debt limit, highway funding and the federal budget.\n\nSEE ALSO: Marco Rubio defends missing Senate votes, says Obama would veto many of them\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why the American public is not outraged over the fact that none of their business is taken care of, but over and over and over again we talk about taking health care away from people,\u201d said Rep. Louise Slaughter, New York Democrat.\n\nThe bill\u2019s thorny path through the Senate starts with winning over the chamber\u2019s referee, the parliamentarian, who will rule which provisions meet reconciliation\u2019s arcane rules.\n\nAlready, Republican sponsors stripped out a provision that would repeal Obamacare\u2019s yet-to-be-named board on Medicare spending, since the parliamentarian was likely to rule it out of order.\n\nThe bill also faces trouble from within the party.\n\nA trio of Senate Republicans \u2014 two of them 2016 presidential hopefuls \u2014 said the legislation \u201csimply isn\u2019t good enough\u201d and reneges on repeated vows to repeal the entire law.\n\n\u201cEach of us campaigned on a promise to fully repeal Obamacare and a reconciliation bill is the best way to send such legislation to President Obama\u2019s desk. If this bill cannot be amended so that it fully repeals Obamacare pursuant to Senate rules, we cannot support this bill,\u201d Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and two 2016 hopefuls, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, said before the House vote.\n\nThe bill passed on the strength of Republican votes, however, with only seven GOP members rejecting it and one Democrat, Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota, voting \u201cyes,\u201d though he\u2019s opposed Obamacare in the past.\n\n\u201cWith this bill, we can finally confront the president with the reality confronting working families every day: higher costs and lower quality,\u201d said Rep. Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Republican.\n\nThough he doesn\u2019t want the job, Mr. Ryan is on the cusp of replacing John A. Boehner as speaker after he won support from the House\u2019s three main factions and swayed a majority of the House Freedom Caucus, a coalition of hard-line conservatives who nudged Mr. Boehner out the door.\n\nMr. Ryan is putting himself at odds with Heritage on the reconciliation bill, and Friday\u2019s vote appeared to split the Freedom Caucus itself. For instance, members such as Reps. Raul Labrador of Idaho, Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina and Tim Huelskamp of Kansas supported it, while Reps. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, Ken Buck of Colorado and Matt Salmon of Arizona voted \u201cno.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The House voted Friday to scrap Obamacare's most unpopular mandates and taxes, putting in motion a plan to dismantle the law through the budget process despite Democratic derision and conservative-driven complaints the bill doesn't go far enough.", "Author": "Tom Howell Jr.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The House voted Friday to scrap Obamacare\u2019s most unpopular mandates and taxes, putting in motion a plan to dismantle the law through the budget process despite Democratic derision and conservative-driven complaints the bill doesn\u2019t go far enough.", "title": "House votes to gut Obamacare through budget process", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/23/house-votes-gut-obamacare-through-budget-process/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/10/cfdb99278b8e612d840f6a7067005841.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/10/10/cfdb99278b8e612d840f6a7067005841.jpg", "title": "House votes to gut Obamacare through budget process", "description": "The House voted Friday to scrap Obamacare's most unpopular mandates and taxes, putting in motion a plan to dismantle the law through the budget process despite Democratic derision and conservative-dri", "card": "summary", "site": "@washtimes"}, "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web3", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "news_keywords": "Politics, Obamacare, Republican Party"}, "article_summary": "\u201cEach of us campaigned on a promise to fully repeal Obamacare and a reconciliation bill is the best way to send such legislation to President Obama\u2019s desk.\nMr. Ryan is putting himself at odds with Heritage on the reconciliation bill, and Friday\u2019s vote appeared to split the Freedom Caucus itself.\nThough President Obama can still veto what Congress produces, Republicans want to prove they can dismantle Obamacare with a simple Senate majority and a GOP president in 2017.\nTed Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, said before the House vote.\nDemocrats complained it was the 61st time that House Republicans scheduled a vote to scrap all or part of Obamacare while Congress struggles to meet deadlines on the nation\u2019s debt limit, highway funding and the federal budget."}
