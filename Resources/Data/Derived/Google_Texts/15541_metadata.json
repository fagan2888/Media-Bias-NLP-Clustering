Photo courtesy of Flickr, Waiting for the World\n\nDrinking a glass of the same wine as Jesus did 1,800 years ago may soon be possible thanks to innovations in the science of winemaking. Using ancient grape seeds and Jurassic Park-style methods, archaeologists and geneticists from Ariel University have teamed up to make the wine King David and Jesus Christ drank.\n\n\u201cAll our scriptures are full with wine and with grapes \u2014 before the French were even thinking about making wine, we were exporting wine,\u201d lead researcher Eliyashiv Drori, an oenologist (a sort-of winemaker-scientist hybrid) at Ariel University, told The New York Times. \u201cWe have a very ancient identity, and for me, reconstructing this identity is very important. For me, it\u2019s a matter of national pride.\u201d\n\nBacked with $750,000 from the Jewish National Fund, Israeli winemakers released \u201cmarawi\u201d wine last month at the Recanati Winery \u2014 a small vineyard in Gvaot, near Drori\u2019s home in the West Bank. Marawi (also called hamdani) grapes, which can be traced back to A.D. 220, grew out of a groundbreaking project by Ariel University. The seed specimens were discovered near the site of destroyed Jewish temples, next to a clay sign that read \u201csmooth wine\u201d in ancient Hebraic script. They were found buried within ancient donkey droppings, which researchers suspect ended up there after they were fed pomace \u2014 the remnants of the winemaking process.\n\n\u201cVery good color, very good balance, acid and sugar, body, structure,\u201d Drori said as he sampled the marawi wine. \u201cThat\u2019s a very good wine grape, even without the story.\u201d\n\nAriel University\u2019s research winery is comprised of small cooled trailers with a total of eight wood-aging barrels for creating tiny batches of wine from roughly 30 different grapes. Each bottle of wine is labeled with masking tape and a handwritten note saying where and when it was harvested from the lab\u2019s dig site \u2014 where Drori and his colleagues search for ancient remnants of winemaking grapes.\n\nSince 2011, the researchers have identified 120 distinct varieties of grape using a combination of DNA and a 3D scanner that has never before successfully been used to turn ancient seed artifacts into new grapes. By matching the ancient seeds with live grapes, winemakers are able to engineer fruit from the past and turn it into wine for now and the future. Currently, 20 grape varieties are ready and suitable for wine production.\n\nRecanati Winery produced only 2,480 bottles of the marawi wine in 2014, and it\u2019s only available for purchase in roughly 10 restaurants. The winery itself kept 4,000 bottles of the most recent 2015 marawi to remain onsite for aging. Wine writer Itay Gleitman, who tasted the wine, said it was \u201cpleasant and easy-to-drink\u201d with \u201cgentle aromas of apple and peach.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "birth, jesus, wine, new, wine, making, process, uses, dna, ancient, seeds, recreate, same, wine", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Drinking the same wine Jesus did nearly 2,000 years ago is now possible thanks to a small Israeli vineyard.", "title": "DNA Of Ancient Grape Seeds Used To Make Wine Jesus Drank", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/birth-jesus-wine-new-wine-making-process-uses-dna-ancient-seeds-recreate-same-wine-363318", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/30/jesus-wine.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Drinking the same wine Jesus did nearly 2,000 years ago is now possible thanks to a small Israeli vineyard.", "title": "DNA Of Ancient Grape Seeds Used To Make Wine Jesus Drank", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/birth-jesus-wine-new-wine-making-process-uses-dna-ancient-seeds-recreate-same-wine-363318", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/30/jesus-wine.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/11/30/jesus-wine.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2015-11-30T16:32:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-30T18:36:14-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Drinking the same wine Jesus did nearly 2,000 years ago is now possible thanks to a small Israeli vineyard."}, "article_summary": "Drinking the same wine Jesus did nearly 2,000 years ago is now possible thanks to a small Israeli vineyard.\n\u201cVery good color, very good balance, acid and sugar, body, structure,\u201d Drori said as he sampled the marawi wine.\nUsing ancient grape seeds and Jurassic Park-style methods, archaeologists and geneticists from Ariel University have teamed up to make the wine King David and Jesus Christ drank.\nRecanati Winery produced only 2,480 bottles of the marawi wine in 2014, and it\u2019s only available for purchase in roughly 10 restaurants.\nWine writer Itay Gleitman, who tasted the wine, said it was \u201cpleasant and easy-to-drink\u201d with \u201cgentle aromas of apple and peach.\u201d"}
