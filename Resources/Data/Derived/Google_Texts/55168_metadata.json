The Washington Heights community it serves reflects an impoverished area- 27.6% of the population lived below the federal poverty level in 2013 compared to 2.9% citywide.\n\nIt's unclear what prompted the hospital's initial decision to close the program when there has been a national push, backed by ACA funding, to expand primary care. The legislation provided $230 million to training 1,700 new doctors, nurses and physician assistants in primary care and set aside $5.4 billion in Medicaid reimbursements for primary care, as reported by International Business Times.\n\nRecommended Reading\n\nBecker's Hospital Review: New York-Presbyterian amends decision to shutter family medicine program\n\nInternational Business Times: New York-Presbyterian Hospital to close family medicine center in 2016, amid national push for more primary care under Obamacare", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Nina Flanagan", "twitter": {"domain": "Healthcare Dive", "site": "@healthcaredive", "card": "summary"}, "featured": "False", "sailthru.image.thumb": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/5e/74/5e74d2d104bc61957608d7cec433bcea.jpg", "sailthru.tags": "healthcare,type-newspost,healthcare-hospital-admin,healthcare-practice-mgmt", "news_keywords": "Hospital Administration,Hospital Admin,Practice Management,Practice Mgmt", "category": "News Post", "title": "NY-Presbyterian flip-flops on closing family medicine program", "pub_date": "oct 15, 2015", "section": "news", "sailthru.date": "2015-10-15T08:00:00", "content_boost": 4, "touched": "True", "article_date_original": "Thursday, October 15, 2015, 08:00 AM", "medium": "news", "description": "Healthcare", "sailthru.expire_date": "2025-10-02T08:00:00", "teaser": "<p>After announcing its closure and a&nbsp;strong staff response, NY-Presbyterian will keep the program open.&nbsp;</p>", "sponsored": "False", "date": "2015-10-15", "sailthru.description": "After announcing its closure and a\u00a0strong staff response, NY-Presbyterian will keep the program open.", "viewport": "width=986", "og": {"site_name": "Healthcare Dive", "description": "After announcing its closure and a\u00a0strong staff response, NY-Presbyterian will keep the program open.", "title": "NY-Presbyterian flip-flops on closing family medicine program", "url": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/ny-presbyterian-flip-flops-on-closing-family-medicine-program/407354/", "image": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/diveimage/Seattle_physician_with_patient_1999.jpg", "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "aN-77CvDv8Rt4OQnHMaUSm6V87TF8ri5GDUv93p7pHk", "sailthru.image.full": "http://www.healthcaredive.com/user_media/cache/ee/36/ee3698949c25130ebd0920ad4c9a5e03.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdd0f\"", "article_summary": "Recommended ReadingBecker's Hospital Review: New York-Presbyterian amends decision to shutter family medicine programInternational Business Times: New York-Presbyterian Hospital to close family medicine center in 2016, amid national push for more primary care under Obamacare\nDive Insight:The Center for Family and Community Medicine includes four community health centers, of which the Farrell Center is one.\nThe legislation provided $230 million to training 1,700 new doctors, nurses and physician assistants in primary care and set aside $5.4 billion in Medicaid reimbursements for primary care, as reported by International Business Times.\nIt's unclear what prompted the hospital's initial decision to close the program when there has been a national push, backed by ACA funding, to expand primary care.\nDive Brief:After announcing it would close its family medicine center at the Herman \"Denny\" Farrell Jr. Community Health Center in June 2016, NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital reversed its decision Tuesday after strong staff opposition and said the program will stay open, faculty will remain and it will accept another class of residents."}
