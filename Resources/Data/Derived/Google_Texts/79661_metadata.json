Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\n\nGood evening. Here\u2019s the latest.\n\nPhoto\n\n1. The U.S. and Russia began military-to-military talks on what the Pentagon called \u201cmechanisms for deconfliction\u201d in Syria. Russia has increased its influence in the conflict, supporting the Syrian president with military assistance and rapidly building up its presence at an air base near the coastal city of Latakia.\n\nPhoto\n\n2. President Obama nominated Eric Fanning, a top civilian military adviser, to be secretary of the Army. If confirmed, he would be the first openly gay person to rise to that level of the service. Gay rights group praised the move, with one calling Mr. Fanning \u201cthe perfect choice to lead the world\u2019s best-trained, most dedicated and formidable army.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n3. The White House announced sweeping changes to travel, commerce and investment involving Cuba. The move comes a day before the pope arrives on the island for the start of his North American tour. He\u2019ll be honored for helping broker the deal that ended the U.S. embargo.\n\nPhoto\n\n4. Intensified border controls in Europe effectively trapped at least 15,000 migrants in Croatia, a quandary deepened by the swiftly shifting national priorities in countries along their routes. The Croatian prime minister angered neighboring countries by urging the migrants to find a path forward. \u201cWe cannot house these people,\u201d he said. \u201cWe won\u2019t block entries, but we also won\u2019t block exits.\u201d\n\nPhoto\n\n5. What if emissions controls operated only when a car engine was being tested, then disengaged when it was back on the road? The U.S. said Volkswagen had installed so-called \u201cdefeat devices\u201d in many of its diesel vehicles to do exactly that, and directed the automaker to recall almost 500,000 cars.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nVolkswagen stock slumped 4.52 percent. And markets slid around the world on fears of slowing global growth deepened by the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision not to raise interest rates. The major U.S. indexes were down 1.4 percent to 1.7 percent.\n\nPhoto\n\n6. An investigating general gave the fullest explanation yet as to why Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl walked off his base in Afghanistan in 2009. The general, calling the sergeant delusionally idealistic and urging against imprisoning him, said he had planned to walk to another base to complain to an officer there about problems with his unit.\n\nPhoto\n\n7. Congress began a series of debates on abortion that could lead to another painful government shutdown. Lawmakers have just two weeks left until the deadline for a spending bill, and Republican leaders are trying to channel the fury at Planned Parenthood into votes on new abortion limits rather than a debate over federal funding for the organization.\n\nPhoto\n\n8. Bernie Sanders bashed billionaires at a town-hall meeting in Manhattan to raise funds for his Democratic presidential campaign and taped an appearance on the \u201cLate Show\u201d with Stephen Colbert (CBS, 11:35 p.m. Eastern). Most of his Republican rivals appeared at a gathering of Heritage Action, a conservative advocacy group, in Greenville, S.C., but Donald Trump \u2014 who said he\u2019d spend $100 million or more to secure the nomination \u2014 skipped it to close a deal.\n\nPhoto\n\n9. Japan\u2019s ruling party powered through protests both in and outside of Parliament, passing legislation giving the nation greater military leeway abroad.\n\nPhoto\n\n10. A new study showing that Inuits have genetic adaptations that allow them to metabolize fats raised questions about whether others who adopt a diet rich in fish oil receive the same protection from heart disease. \u201cThe same diet may have different effects on different people,\u201d said one of the authors.\n\nPhoto\n\n11. The comedian Andy Samberg hosts the Emmy Awards on Sunday, overseeing a sprawling, celebrity-packed celebration of the booming television industry. \u201cIt\u2019s really the big story,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cTelevision is expanding into so many formats, and there is such a wide swath of different types of shows. There\u2019s something for everybody.\u201d (8 p.m. Eastern, Fox)\n\nVideo\n\n12. Watch: For the coming six weeks of the Rugby World Cup, London\u2019s O2 building (formerly the Millennium Dome) will showcase one of the world\u2019s biggest projection mapping projects. The technology behind it is complex, but the result is a beautiful blooming rose over the surface of the roof. Messages of support for England\u2019s team, tweeted with the #WearTheRose hashtag, will also stream over the dome, to be photographed by cameras positioned above and retweeted as GIFs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nHave a great weekend.\n\nVideo produced by Caitlin Prentke.\n\nThe Evening Briefing by Email Get a nightly rundown of the day's top stories delivered to your inbox every Monday through Friday.\n\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\n\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.\n\nWant to look back?
