More than 18,000 working adults ages 18 to 64, one from each included family, were interviewed by a Census Bureau employee in person or by phone.\n\nRoughly 10,500 participants had paid sick leave benefits, while 7,800 did not. Those without were more likely to be male, unmarried, less educated, Hispanic, to work in the service industry, to work part time, be uninsured and have poor health.\n\nOverall, those without paid leave were three times as likely to skip medical care for themselves compared to those with paid leave.\n\nUninsured people with annual family income below $35,000 were most likely to skip medical care because of cost, with 11 percent saying they did so in the past year. In the same income bracket, 14 percent said a family member had delayed care because of cost.\n\nAs annual income increased, the risk of skipping care decreased, and the risks were smaller for insured families.\n\nEvidence suggests that paid sick leave is tied to increased job stability and employee retention following illness, injury, or birth of a child, increased worker productivity, decreased worker errors, decreased accidents or injuries on the job, and when used to augment maternity leave, paid leave increases well-baby visits, maternal health, and the duration of breastfeeding, while also decreasing infant mortality, the authors note in the paper.\n\nDelaying needed medical care can lead to more complicated, disabling, and expensive health conditions, while missing work without paid leave adds lost wages to the cost of medical care, DeRigne said.\n\n\u201cWe believe all workers should have access to guaranteed paid sick leave benefits,\u201d DeRigne said.\n\n\u201cIn most countries, paid sick leave is regulated by legislation and relates to all enterprises in the countries concerned,\u201d said Xenia Scheil-Adlung, Health Policy Coordinator in the Social Protection Department of the International Labor Organization in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nPaid sick leave should be available to all workers as part of decent working conditions, Scheil-Adlung told Reuters Health by email.\n\n\u201cFinancial protection in case of sickness includes both coverage of health care costs and income replacement,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd given the higher productivity of healthy workers, paid sick leave has a return on investment for employers, Scheil-Adlung said.\n\nSOURCE: Health Affairs, online March 7, 2016.\n\nRead the original article on Reuters.
