A plan with a lower premium might suit many people who are in decent health and rarely go to the doctor, said Joe Ellis, a senior vice president at CBIZ Benefits and Insurance Services, a Cleveland, Ohio-based professional services company. Some individuals are \u201cpretty sure\u201d they will not \u201cvoluntarily\u201d use medical services and are attempting to \u201cmitigate the risk from an unexpected need for services,\u201d he said.\n\nBalancing the total cost of the plan compared to the deductible and coinsurance along with prescription drugs helps consumers estimate the approximate costs and decide on the right plan.\n\n\u201cI am not one to immediately opt for the best plan if it is reasonable to expect no need for it,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cFor example, if I am in pretty good health, have no terribly harmful habits and haven\u2019t used my health plan for a few years, I would choose the low premium cost plan, even if it had high deductibles.\u201d\n\nJust choosing the same plan you had previously can backfire especially if you only went to the doctor once or twice last year.\n\n\u201cMaybe it worked O.K., maybe it didn\u2019t, but it\u2019s not like you really dug in to your other options to know anyway,\u201d said Amanda Lannert, CEO at Jellyvision, a Chicago-based employee benefits software company. \u201cThe truth is, unless there\u2019s a palpable sense that you were getting screwed, it feels fine to leave things are as are.\u201d\n\nFactors To Consider\n\nMany preventive services like an annual physical are now free, while other procedures such as a MRI could be subject to cost sharing in the form of deductibles or coinsurance. If you are unsure of the costs, call a health provider to determine the cost.\n\nStart by figuring out how much money your budget allows you to spend on a plan, Ellis said.\n\n\u201cYou want to be prepared before you go anywhere near your choices,\u201d he said. \u201cTaking the time to understand your financial picture makes it immensely easier shop for a health plan.\u201d\n\nSeeking advice from someone in human resources or an insurance agent is helpful, because such people are skilled at \u201cfocusing in on the things that matter the most,\u201d he said. These factors could include the premium, the amount of money you have to spend on top of the premium and the breadth of providers near you.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing more frustrating than choosing a plan only to find out that the network of providers is limited,\u201d Ellis said. \u201cJust because your primary care doc is in the network does not mean that the best specialists will be in network. The days of \u2018everybody is in network\u2019 are gone.\u201d\n\nWhen consumers wait until the last minute to choose a plan, they tend to just examine the monthly premiums and overlook the co-pay and deductibles, two of the largest financial factors to consider when they have a doctor\u2019s or hospital visit, said Nate Purpura, vice president of consumer affairs at eHealth.com, an online health insurance exchange based in Mountain View, Calif. A recent survey from eHealth found that 37% said they spend more time thinking about their cable package than their health insurance plan.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"layout": "main", "description": "Choosing a health insurance plan should not be a decision which consumers approach lightly, but the majority of individuals spend less than 30 minutes researching their benefits.", "author": "Ellen Chang", "og": {"site_name": "MainStreet", "description": "Choosing a health insurance plan should not be a decision which consumers approach lightly, but the majority of individuals spend less than 30 minutes researching their benefits.", "title": "Refusing to Spend Time Choosing a Health Insurance Plan Costs Consumers Dearly", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/refusing-to-spend-time-choosing-a-health-insurance-plan-costs-consumers-dearly", "image": {"width": 600, "secure_url": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsurancescreen.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsurancescreen.jpg", "height": 400}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "section": "Financial Planning", "keywords": "premium, co-pay, coinsurance, out of network, deductible, ACA, Obamacare", "fb": {"app_id": 925400040808836}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MainStreet", "section": "Financial Planning", "tag": "Obamacare", "published_time": "2015-09-28T15:58Z", "author": "https://www.mainstreet.com/author/1611359"}, "date": "2015-09-28T15:58Z", "contentType": "article", "guid": 13301038, "twitter": {"description": "Choosing a health insurance plan should not be a decision which consumers approach lightly, but the majority of individuals spend less than 30 minutes researching their benefits.", "title": "Refusing to Spend Time Choosing a Health Insurance Plan Costs Consumers Dearly", "url": "https://www.mainstreet.com/article/refusing-to-spend-time-choosing-a-health-insurance-plan-costs-consumers-dearly", "image": {"src": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsurancescreen.jpg", "identifier": "https://s.mainstreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/healthinsurancescreen.jpg"}, "site": "@mainstr", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "premium, co-pay, coinsurance, out of network, deductible, ACA, Obamacare"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd16ee\"", "article_summary": "Why Choosing the Right Plan Makes SenseMillennials and Gen X-ers who are healthy and think that a barebones health insurance plan will suffice may find themselves in for a surprise if an accident or injury occurs.\nStart by figuring out how much money your budget allows you to spend on a plan, Ellis said.\n\u201cThere is nothing more frustrating than choosing a plan only to find out that the network of providers is limited,\u201d Ellis said.\nBalancing the total cost of the plan compared to the deductible and coinsurance along with prescription drugs helps consumers estimate the approximate costs and decide on the right plan.\nIf you are unsure of the costs, call a health provider to determine the cost."}
