The gap in spaces needed causes mothers to scramble for options, rely on sub-par care, or simply drop out of work.\n\n\u201cWe have too many children being cared for in illegal child-care spaces,\u201d Gregson said. \u201cAnd we are seeing grandparents now that have to do child care for their own children, when they thought they would be focusing on retirement. The results of the poll (supporting the $10-a-Day plan) are consistent across age groups.\u201d\n\n$1,900\n\nTHE FEES\n\nFees for child care in Vancouver are the second-highest in Canada, behind only Toronto, according to statistics from B.C. child-care advocates. B.C.\u2019s average child-care cost averages are:\n\n\u2022 Infants: $1,047 per month \u2014 up to $1,900/month in Vancouver;\n\n\u2022 Toddlers: $907 per month \u2014 up to $1,560/month in Vancouver;\n\n\u2022 3-5 year olds: $761 per month \u2014 up to $1,395 in Vancouver.\n\nHigh fees are connected to B.C.\u2019s below-average labour-force participation. In B.C., 64.4 per cent of mothers with children 0-2 are in the paid workforce; 74.6 per cent of mothers with children 3-5 are in the workforce; and 82.1 per cent of mothers with children 6-15 are in the workforce.\n\n74%\n\nTHE SUPPORT\n\nThree-in-four British Columbians support the $10-a-Day proposal, according to the Insights West poll, including 83 per cent of those who have had recent experiences trying to access child care. According to the pollsters, support for increased government involvement in child care cuts across ideological lines, and three-in-five residents would consider voting for a political party that implemented the $10-a-Day plan.\n\n$55\n\nTHE TAX CREDIT\n\nAccording to Insights West, poll results showed that the government\u2019s \u201cEarly Years Strategy\u201d is not sufficient to satisfy the broad support for increased child care expressed by survey respondents.\n\nA $55-per-month early childhood tax credit for parents with a child under age 6, set to start this April, was seen as beneficial by 50 per cent of survey respondents. But 64 per cent believe it is better to fund services allowing parents to enrol their children in child-care facilities. And just 22 per cent think it is better for the government to provide cash for parents so they can decide on their own how to cover child-care costs for their children.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s move to increase the monthly taxable Universal Child Care Benefit payment from $100 to $160 is seen as beneficial by 62 per cent of survey respondents.\n\nscooper@theprovince.com\n\ntwitter.com/scoopercooper", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "The Province", "generator": "WordPress.com", "msapplication-tooltip": "The Vancouver Province", "ROBOTS": "NOARCHIVE", "fb": {"app_id": 135455519931679}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "keywords": "vancouver, bc, british columbia, childcare, parenting, lifestyle, parents, children, daycare, sam cooper, the province, by the numbers, canada, taxes, government, british columbia, canada, childcare, culture and lifestyle, daycare, family, parenting, sam cooper, taxes, vancouver", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://blogs.theprovince.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico", "description": "An Insights West survey found that most people in B.C. would prefer the government solve the problem of childcare shortages rather than give parents a small tax credit to cover child care costs."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fddf59\"", "article_summary": "\u201cWe have too many children being cared for in illegal child-care spaces,\u201d Gregson said.\nSharon Gregson, a child-care advocate, said that since the plan was introduced in 2011, the new poll results show the highest level of support ever.\nBy Sam CooperThe ProvinceA new survey shows a majority of people understand the acute shortage in licensed child-care spaces in B.C., and they would prefer the government solve the problem rather than give parents a small tax credit to cover child-care costs.\nBut 64 per cent believe it is better to fund services allowing parents to enrol their children in child-care facilities.\n102,908NUMBER OF SPACESRecent statistics show just 102,908 licensed child-care spaces are available in B.C., which only meets the needs of 18 per cent of about 570,000 children (0-12) in the province."}
