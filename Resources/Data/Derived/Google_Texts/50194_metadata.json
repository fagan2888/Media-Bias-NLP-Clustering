Andrew Hinderaker for The Wall Street Journal\n\nGerman expatriates gathered on Manhattan\u2019s East Side on Thursday to root for their country in a World Cup match against the U.S.\n\nZum Schneider, an East Village Bavarian beer hall and restaurant, followed in the European tradition by setting up a big screen at an outdoor event space at E. 23rd St by the East River. They also served up German-only beers alongside bratwurst and a themed band, to complete the scene.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a German restaurant so we tried to bring all German stuff here,\u201d said Micha Gerland, one of the restaurant\u2019s managers and a Berlin native. \u201cWe thought to start open-air viewing here because it really should be done more.\u201d\n\nFans react at Zum Schneider as Germany scores against the U.S. Andrew Hinderaker for The Wall Street Journal\n\nFellow organizer Angela Wendt added it took the company six months to find the Solar One outdoor venue and make arrangements to show soccer games there. They will also be showing all the quarter-final games and the World Cup final on July 13 at the outdoor space. \u201cOutdoor viewing is all over Europe so we had to do it,\u201d she said.\n\nPhilipp Huesgen, 33 years-old, a finance worker clad head to toe in German colors, took the day off to watch the game there. \u201cThis is a good place to be,\u201d he added as he soaked up the sun and a slender 1-0 German victory over the U.S. \u201cIt\u2019s very big to watch like this in Germany\u2013you can do it in every town,\u201d he added.\n\nAmerican Ray Williams, 45 years-old and married to a German, said he appreciated the scene. As a United Airlines pilot, he was due to watch the game in Dusseldorf until his schedule was changed.\n\nFans watch the World Cup match between USA and Germany at Zum Schneider. Andrew Hinderaker for The Wall Street Journal\n\n\u201cThis is the way to watch there and something we have to do here in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely more fun.\u201d\n\nThe riverside venue attracted more than a thousand soccer fans for the game\u2014and not all of them rooted for \u201cDeutschland.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all American today,\u201d said Frank Fellone, 31, a part-German construction worker in a U.S. jersey. \u201cI\u2019m not conflicted at all,\u201d he added of supporting America.\n\nThere were cheers all round at the end of the match. Despite the 1-0 German victory, both teams progressed to the next knockout phase of the competition.\n\nRelated Coverage:", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "description": "German expatriates gathered on Manhattan's East Side on Thursday to root for their country in a World Cup match against the U.S.", "title": "Rooting For Germany, From Manhattan, in the World Cup", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/06/26/rooting-for-germany-from-manhattan-in-the-world-cup/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DL215_NYWC01_P_20140626153501.jpg"}, "site": "WSJNY", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "New York", "article.headline": "Rooting For Germany, From Manhattan, in the World Cup", "description": "German expatriates gathered on Manhattan's East Side on Thursday to root for their country in a World Cup match against the U.S.", "article_section": "New York", "author": "Joe Jackson", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "Metropolis Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "Metropolis", "article.summary": "German expatriates gathered on Manhattan's East Side on Thursday to root for their country in a World Cup match against the U.S.", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-06-26T20:19:34-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-139", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/06/26/rooting-for-germany-from-manhattan-in-the-world-cup/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-METROB-20955", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "New York", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "German expatriates gathered on Manhattan's East Side on Thursday to root for their country in a World Cup match against the U.S.", "title": "Rooting For Germany, From Manhattan, in the World Cup", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2014/06/26/rooting-for-germany-from-manhattan-in-the-world-cup/", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DL215_NYWC01_P_20140626153501.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Metropolis", "article.id": "BL-METROB-20955", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-26T20:19:34-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcd5d5\"", "article_summary": "Fans react as Germany wins a World Cup match against the USA at Zum Schneider in Manhattan on Thursday.\nFans watch the World Cup match between USA and Germany at Zum Schneider.\nThey will also be showing all the quarter-final games and the World Cup final on July 13 at the outdoor space.\nAndrew Hinderaker for The Wall Street Journal\u201cThis is the way to watch there and something we have to do here in the U.S.,\u201d he said.\nAs a United Airlines pilot, he was due to watch the game in Dusseldorf until his schedule was changed."}
