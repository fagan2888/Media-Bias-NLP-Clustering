After four years representing the 33rd Congressional District, Marc Veasey knows the issues most important to his Fort Worth and Dallas constituents. And he now has enough experience in Washington to effectively work in their best interests.

He is the best choice for Democratic voters in the March 1 primary over community activist Carlos Quintanilla.

Veasey, 45, of Fort Worth, has generally been a loyal supporter of President Barack Obama — backing anti-terrorism efforts and the Affordable Care Act. But he’s also shown thoughtfulness and independence, deviating from the party line when he felt it necessary.

For example, he crossed the aisle and voted for the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, saying it was the safest way to transport oil and created jobs.

Still, Veasey’s duties in Washington have not prevented him from being a visible presence in this district, which stretches from east Fort Worth to west Dallas. That’s important to staying grounded in local issues.

Quintanilla, 58, has been a champion of several causes over the years. He was at the center of combating “cheese” heroin in this area and led efforts to bring Breakfast in the Classroom to DISD.

But his abrasiveness, tendency toward misleading overstatements, and inability to collaborate with others would hinder his ability to represent his district’s interests well.

Consider Quintanilla’s digging in against the USA Freedom Act, whose provisions regarding data searching actually moved toward his interest in restoring citizen privacy. Because the act didn’t give him everything he wanted, he says he would have voted against it altogether.

It’s this sort of digging in, all-or-nothing attitude and overt dismissal of national security concerns that make him unappealing for public office.

The winner of the Democratic primary will face Republican opposition in November.
