Joan O'Malley's been visiting our beaches for a decade.\n\n\"When we get here it's, okay, we're home now. It's three months here, we just love it,\" O'Malley said.\n\nShe says it was a natural choice to celebrate at her home away from home.\n\n\"I knew there was going to be a big party here and I thought, 'This is the place for me,'\" she said. \"And I think everybody down here really enjoys this party, and I wanted to be in on it down here.\"\n\nOn February 15, 1964, O'Malley worked late into the into the night sewing that first set of flags. She says at the time she had no idea of the historical significance of what she was doing.\"\n\n\"My dad, he realized it, and he was all excited,\" she said. \"And I was saying, you know, why is he all excited about this? I'm just going to sew these flags and that's it.\"\n\nThe committee says it's last year they'll honor Canada Day in Bay County, after 12 years of celebrations.\n\nBut committee members and snowbirds alike say they hope another group will continue the celebration.\n\nO'Malley says someone actually stole the first flag she sewed only a few days after it was first put on display.\n\nAnd Canadians have no idea where it is to this day!", "article_metadata": {"description": "Canadians celebrated their country and culture at the area's annual Canada Day Sunday afternoon, and the group honored a special guest during the country's 50th anniversary of its Maple Leaf flag.", "language": "english", "author": "Carly Hildyard", "og": {"url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Canadians-Hold-Local-Celebrations-for-50th-Maple-Leaf-Flag-Anniversary-292034671.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/561*315/canada18.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "Canadians celebrated their country and culture at the area's annual Canada Day Sunday afternoon, and the group honored a special guest during the country's 50th anniversary of its Maple Leaf flag.", "title": "Canadians Hold Local Celebration for 50th Maple Leaf Flag Anniversary"}, "twitter": {"description": "Canadians celebrated their country and culture at the area's annual Canada Day Sunday afternoon, and the group honored a special guest during the country's 50th anniversary of its Maple Leaf flag.", "title": "Canadians Hold Local Celebration for 50th Maple Leaf Flag Anniversary", "url": "http://www.wjhg.com/home/headlines/Canadians-Hold-Local-Celebrations-for-50th-Maple-Leaf-Flag-Anniversary-292034671.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/561*315/canada18.jpg", "creator": "@WJHG_TV", "site": "@WJHG_TV", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "keywords": "Canadians Hold Local Celebration for 50th Maple Leaf Flag Anniversary", "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "orfdzs_E4bRXom1qluA34zerrmjsg4QfrlLSkrR3ZAQ", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Canadians Hold Local Celebration for, 50th Maple Leaf Flag Anniversary"}, "article_summary": "They celebrated their country and culture at the area's annual Canada Day Sunday afternoon, and the group honored a special guest during the country's 50th anniversary of its Maple Leaf flag.\nYou might not expect to find a blend of cultures at Panama City Beach's Canada Day.\nThe committee says it's last year they'll honor Canada Day in Bay County, after 12 years of celebrations.\n\"And especially this year being the 50th year, we really wanted to do something special, bring the Canada event really to a peak.\"\nBut snowbirds from all of Canada's and several different countries who vacation here every year say they wouldn't miss the celebration."}
