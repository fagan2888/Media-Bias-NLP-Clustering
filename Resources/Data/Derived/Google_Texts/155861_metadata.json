John Bel Edwards (D) expanded the program by executive order on his first day as Louisiana\u2019s newly elected governor.\n\nEdwards\u2019 January 12 order opens the state\u2019s Medicaid rolls to 298,000 newly eligible, non-elderly adults whose income falls below 138 percent of the poverty level, according to an analysis from the state\u2019s Legislative Fiscal Office (LFO). LFO says 224,000 people who currently have private or employer-sponsored health insurance will also become eligible to switch to Medicaid, and LFO predicts up to 89,600 of these people will drop their private plans and join Medicaid.\n\nExpanding Dependence on Government\n\nKevin Kane, president of the Pelican Institute for Public Policy, says Edwards\u2019 order will increase costs and dependence on government.\n\n\u201cGiven the poor outcomes for people on Medicaid, one would expect the quality of care to decline when people move from private insurance to Medicaid,\u201d Kane said. \u201cIn either event, how can anyone argue that we should strive to maximize the number of people who rely on government to provide a basic service like health care?\u201d\n\nShifting the poorest Americans to the government rolls was \u201cpart of a deal\u201d insurance companies originally struck when many agreed to support the Affordable Care Act, says Josh Brown, a legislative advocate and policy analyst for the Ohio Municipal League.\n\n\u201cThe insurance companies would agree to Obamacare\u2019s regulations if the federal government would take the most costly customers out of the market by getting them on Medicaid,\u201d Brown said. \u201cMeanwhile, government dependence is increased.\u201d\n\nExpansion Shifts Taxpayer Burden\n\nEdwards says his order to expand Medicaid \u201cwould ensure that Louisiana has the full financial support of the federal government\u201d and allow state leaders to \u201cfocus our attention on getting our finances in order,\u201d according to a press release by his office at the time of the signing.\n\nKane says Edwards\u2019 order increases the burden placed on the state\u2019s taxpayers.\n\n\u201cThe taxpayers are ultimately on the hook for these federal programs, so we should not pretend that this is \u2018free\u2019 money,\u201d Kane said. \u201cIf the federal government reduces its share of the Medicaid burden, the states will have to pick up the slack.\u201d\n\nInstead of expanding Medicaid, states should be given more flexibility in determining how to handle uninsured citizens, Kane says.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, states cannot take this power for themselves,\u201d Kane said. \u201cIt will need to be granted by policymakers in [Washington,] DC. This is unlikely to happen unless states push back against Medicaid expansion and lobby for a new approach.\u201d\n\nBen Johnson (therightswriter@gmail.com) writes from Stockport, Ohio.\n\nInternet Info:\n\nJames A.
