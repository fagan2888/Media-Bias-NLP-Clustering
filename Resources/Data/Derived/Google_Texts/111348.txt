A Pastor in Moore says he will make things right for an Oklahoma City family who lives in a house he owns.

Maria Lewis says her five children, her husband and she have all been sleeping in a back bedroom of a small home Larry Hutcheson owns. Hutcheson is Lead Pastor at Power House Assembly of God in Moore.

Lewis says besides a few space heaters, the house doesn't have heat. A city health inspector says he told Hutcheson in mid-December to fix the heat situation in 48 hours. Hutcheson says he's been working on it.

"You can only make plumbers move so fast. But we're here to do what we can and get it done as quickly as we can," Hutcherson said.

Hutcheson says the family will have heat by Thursday.
