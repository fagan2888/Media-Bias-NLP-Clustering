And a dutifully compliant Congressional Budget Office chimed in on Obamacare\u2019s \u201cdeficit benefits,\u201d continuing to count unspecified Medicare savings which will never be realized -- just as 1997 Medicare \u201csavings\u201d were being permanently eliminated by the GOP\u2019s \u201cdoc fix.\u201d\n\nOf course, only slightly more than 50% of doctors will accept new Medicaid patients, millions were rolled over from insurance they liked, millions more were simply dodging a penalty, 1.6 million enrollees didn\u2019t even bother to pay. And more and more are finding $6,000 deductibles, massive out-of-network expenses, and double digit premium increases now that insurance company subsidies have ended.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s response? \u201cWe can\u2019t let these critical subsides expire immediately.\u201d\n\nAll of this comes on the heels of six other Republican efforts to resurrect Obama\u2019s fortunes, decimate their own base, and give Clinton a \u201clock\u201d on the White House in 2016:\n\nONE: There was the Cromnibus to fund Obama\u2019s illegal executive actions.\n\nTWO: There was the \u201cdoc fix\u201d payoff of the American Medical Association -- for providing pivotal support for the passage of Obamacare.\n\nTHREE: There was the concession that opposition to the Hyde Amendment was a legitimate beef.\n\nFOUR: There were McConnell\u2019s ruthless efforts to hand Obama a victory on the Loretta Lynch nomination.\n\nFIVE: There was Obama\u2019s momentous victory on fast-track.\n\nSIX: There are the continuing efforts to pass a Rooseveltian highway bill.\n\nIf the election of 1988 shows us anything, it is that the one way to break the two-terms-in two-terms-out cycle of party control of the presidency is the perception of a successful president. You will remember that Democrats did not make that mistake with George Bush.\n\nSo what is to be done?\n\nONE: Get rid of the feckless McConnell and Boehner. They combine the deadly trifecta of stupidity, cowardice, and resolve.\n\nTWO: Kill the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It will have pages of general statements, which, in the hands of Obama-packed courts, will give rise to a \u201cNew (Court-created) World Order.\u201d\n\nTHREE: Kill the highway bill. It will be the payoff of Democrats who voted for fast-track (Ex-Im Bank reauthorization), together with a realization of Obama\u2019s infrastructure priorities.\n\nFOUR: Tell Pat Toomey to shut up about reviving gun control.\n\nFIVE: Stop voting for the rule. Both fast-track and the Cromnibus were passed because congressmen supposedly opposed to them voted to bring them to the floor.\n\nSIX: Support the Senate rules. Remember, earlier this year, how some short-sighted conservatives were pushing to eliminate the filibuster of legislation and the Supreme Court nominees -- while retaining the 50 vote margin for Obama appointees like Loretta Lynch? How do you feel about that?\n\nSEVEN: Fight the CR. The press will try to tell you that using the \u201cpower of the purse\u201d is discredited. But the GOP has so badly botched the last six years that, frankly, they don\u2019t have any other options left.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Once again, the dim-witted trio of Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, and John Roberts have been outsmarted by Barack Obama..05/26/2016 19:06:31PM EST.", "author": "Michael Hammond", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Once again, the dim-witted trio of Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, and John Roberts have been outsmarted by Barack Obama.", "title": "- Seven Ways the GOP has Guaranteed Hillary\u2019s Election\u2014And Seven Ways to Stop it", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/michaelhammond/2015/06/29/seven-ways-the-gop-has-guaranteed-hillarys-electionand-seven-ways-to-stop-it-n2018719", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/175/2cb8e4e9-d6b8-4f2f-9896-d318a544b116.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Once again, the dim-witted trio of Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, and John Roberts have been outsmarted by Barack Obama.", "title": "- Seven Ways the GOP has Guaranteed Hillary\u2019s Election\u2014And Seven Ways to Stop it", "url": "http://townhall.com/columnists/michaelhammond/2015/06/29/seven-ways-the-gop-has-guaranteed-hillarys-electionand-seven-ways-to-stop-it-n2018719", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2015/175/2cb8e4e9-d6b8-4f2f-9896-d318a544b116.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Seven Ways the GOP has Guaranteed Hillary\u2019s Election\u2014And Seven Ways to Stop it, Michael Hammond, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Once again, the dim-witted trio of Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, and John Roberts have been outsmarted by Barack Obama.\nBut the GOP has so badly botched the last six years that, frankly, they don\u2019t have any other options left.\nFOUR: There were McConnell\u2019s ruthless efforts to hand Obama a victory on the Loretta Lynch nomination.\nTWO: There was the \u201cdoc fix\u201d payoff of the American Medical Association -- for providing pivotal support for the passage of Obamacare.\nBoth fast-track and the Cromnibus were passed because congressmen supposedly opposed to them voted to bring them to the floor."}
