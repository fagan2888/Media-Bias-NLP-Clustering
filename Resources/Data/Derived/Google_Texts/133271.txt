Think about how you felt the last time you upgraded the Windows operating system on your computer versus opening the box of a new iPhone. Both involve the consumer experiencing a new piece of technology for the first time. One is dreaded, while the other is full of joyous anticipation. The difference is the design of the user experience (UX).

In the digital age, UX is arguably the most important face of your brand. Very few of your customers will ever meet the dedicated members of your team that engineered and created your product, but all will interact with your UX. The strength of brand loyalty begins with how your product makes people feel.

Too many startups, in their haste to rush products out to market, sacrifice UX for the sake of design efficiency. It doesn’t matter how good your product solution is if users don’t enjoy or understand how to use it. For example, Expedia and Travelocity were industry leaders in booking online travel. Each had a clean user interface to what was essentially a consumer-facing database. Then, Hipmunk, with its sleek graphical user interface, came in as a late entrant and stole market share by designing a UX that was pleasingly simple. Hipmunk enabled travels to visually see which flights with connections were quickest without doing any math or calculating desperate time zones. (Hipmunk also added the ability for users to sort flights by “agony” which made the process fun and responsive.) UX can be a competitive advantage.

When we designed the UX for Realty Mogul, we had the challenge of reducing the complexity of analyzing real estate financials without diminishing consumers’ access to robust data. Striking the proper balance never comes on the first try. In the age of big data, there is no excuse for not A/B testing every stage of design, from color scheme and layout, to font style and iconography, in order to design the perfect user experience. The more users your application has, the better your UX should become. We ultimately chose a soothing color palate mixed with a lot of open space.

How do you know when your UX is working? When the majority of your customers become repeat customers you have succeeded.

Having launched dozens of websites and apps used by millions, here are the three most important attributes I consider in UX:

- The interface must communicate the values of the product, not just its features. Why is your product different? How does it make my life easier? Digital products are for the most part services that empower consumers to achieve something that they couldn’t do before. Every screen must reflect your value proposition.

- Consumers have very short attention spans and are looking for any excuse to click away and move on with their lives. Your UX must make the experience fun and rewarding. Google Now, which uses an Android phone’s location to anticipate the consumer’s needs, recommends dishes when you enter a restaurant, tells you train schedules when you arrive at a station or the weather when your plane lands in another city. As counterintuitive as it may sound, Google Now figured out how to take the search out of searching for information.

- UX design must reflect the brand image. Ever notice that all the women in a Kellogg’s Special K commercial wear only red? Or that the Fedex logo has a secret arrow in it? Once you know your company’s attributes, make sure it is reflected in every aspect of the design experience. While many companies created wearable technology to track your exercise progress, Nike+ Fuelband focused on how users feel as they either achieve or miss their goals. If the Nike brand is about celebrating athletic achievement, then the Fuelband should cheer you on and reward you. Nike used the same technology as the competition, but their UX is beyond compare.

By leveraging each consumer interaction to improve your UX, companies can channel their data into insights for great UX. Design is how you make your first impression with your consumers. Make sure it is a lasting one.
