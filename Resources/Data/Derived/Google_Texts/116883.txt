LOS ANGELES (AP) — Police say hikers have found a human skull in Griffith Park in Los Angeles.

Lt. Ryan Schatz said the two hikers stumbled on the skull Saturday afternoon about 400 feet from the Brush Canyon trail near the Hollywood sign.

Schatz said the skull appeared to be several years old.

Other body parts have not been located.

Schatz said coroner and homicide investigators closed access to the area and will search for possible additional evidence.

Covering 6 ½ square miles in the eastern Santa Monica Mountain range, Griffith Park is considered the largest municipal park in the nation.
