They still have a lot of work to [do to] win people over.\"\n\nBut the survey also found that the percentage of Americans who lack health insurance was just 11 percent, the lowest rate since Bankrate began asking that question last August. Last summer, 15 percent of respondents reported not having health insurance, Whiteman said.\n\nRead MoreRetire early due to Obamacare? Maybe not\n\n\n\nAnd 23 percent of respondents who had employer-sponsored health insurance told Bankrate that they are more likely to retire early or otherwise leave their jobs because of aspects of Obamacare that dilute the advantage of job-linked coverage. Just 8 percent said they were less likely to leave their employer as a result.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office earlier this year predicted that the equivalent of 2.5 million jobs could disappear by 2024 as a result of people leaving the workforce or reducing hours worked due to Obamacare's effects.\n\nThe public's generally negative or neutral view the ACA's impact as measured by the survey comes weeks after the White House proudly announced that more than 8 million people had enrolled in Obamacare individual insurance plans sold on the government-run health exchanges. That was 1 million above original projections made for the plans, which take effect for the first time this year.\n\nIn addition to those plans, which are often subsidized by the government, Obamacare bars insurers from discriminating against people with pre-existing medical conditions, mandates that plans cover a set of \"essential health benefits\" at no extra out-of-pocket cost and allows states to expand Medicaid eligibility to all poor adults. The law also mandates that people under age 26 be allowed to be stay on their parents' insurance.\n\nRead MoreWhen staying healthy forces you to break the law\n\n\n\nThe health-exchange sold plans, as well as similar policies sold outside the exchanges and expanded Medicaid eligibility, have been credited with pushing the uninsured rate of Americans to record low levels.\n\nBut Whitman said those benefits apparently haven't been enough to overcome overall persistent negative public opinion about the ACA, which has also been found in other polls besides those of Bankrate.\n\nA Bankrate survey last month found that 45 percent of respondents said they believed Obamacare should be repealed; 44 percent said it should be maintained.", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "description": "More than 7 out of 10 Americans says Obamacare has had a mostly negative effect or not much of one at all on the US, according to a Bankrate survey.", "author": "Dan Mangan", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "More than 7 out of 10 Americans says Obamacare has had a mostly negative effect or not much of one at all on the US, according to a Bankrate survey.", "title": "7 in 10 say Obamacare had bad or zero impact on US", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/05/28/seven-in-10-people-say-obamacare-had-bad-or-zero-impact-on-us.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/02/27/101453434-469197177r.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "More than 7 out of 10 Americans says Obamacare has had a mostly negative effect or not much of one at all on the US, according to a Bankrate survey.", "title": "Seven in 10 people say Obamacare had bad or zero impact on US", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2014/05/28/seven-in-10-people-say-obamacare-had-bad-or-zero-impact-on-us.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2014/02/27/101453434-469197177r.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@_DanMangan", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Obamacare, Health Care, Obamacare, US: News, Politics, Bankrate Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2014-05-28T00:01:00-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/dan.mangan.54", "section": "Obamacare", "modified_time": "2014-05-28T00:02:11-0400", "tag": "Bankrate Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 101707786, "news_keywords": "Obamacare, Affordable Care Act, health insurance"}, "article_summary": "A Bankrate survey last month found that 45 percent of respondents said they believed Obamacare should be repealed; 44 percent said it should be maintained.\nLast summer, 15 percent of respondents reported not having health insurance, Whiteman said.\n\"These findings indicate that more than 7 in 10 Americans don't feel like Obamacare has been worth it,\" said Bankrate.com insurance analyst Doug Whiteman.\nThat was 1 million above original projections made for the plans, which take effect for the first time this year.\nBut the survey also found that the percentage of Americans who lack health insurance was just 11 percent, the lowest rate since Bankrate began asking that question last August."}
