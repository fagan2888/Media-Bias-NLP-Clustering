It creates far more problems for these animals. It\u2019s amazing how the feral-cat crowd admits that \"it\u2019s easier said than done to trap them all.\" Leaving just a few unaltered cats results in geometric birth rates for them, thus worsening the problem.\n\nIf hawks, bears and coyotes are preying on feral cats, as Hall notes, this is one of nature\u2019s built-in check-and-balance mechanisms at work. Having lived next to a feral-cat colony that was registered in Brevard County (64 cats were \"notched\") for years, I can attest to the stench of marking and defecation, 4 a.m. mating/screeching, and fighting. During this time, I observed do-gooders driving up, dumping bags of cat food and then driving off. These people persist in perpetuating injured animals that are doomed to a short, violent life.\n\nLaine Mcmillan, Titusville\n\nElect a Congress that will work for you\n\nOur legislative branch, or Congress, is the most powerful branch within the U.S. government. It possesses the most abilities expressed in the Constitution, and though presidential power can ebb and flow, Congress can consistently trump the executive\u2019s actions. So the question on voters\u2019 minds this Election Day is, \"What has Congress done for me?\" The answer is \"very little.\"\n\nWith approval ratings at 14 percent, our Congress is not only the most powerful, but also the least popular. Lawmakers have failed to fix immigration problems, bureaucratic operations, voters-rights issues and debt-increasing spending. So why re-elect the same incumbents, causing this gridlock to persist another two years? On Election Day, send in a breath of fresh air to the halls of the Capitol and start making Congress the problem-solving machine it is meant to be.\n\nMuch of this year\u2019s election focuses on unpopular presidential policy. However, Obamacare (or more suitably, \"Congresscare\") is a piece of legislation that passed the House and the Senate. Immigration problems in the Southwestern states can be easily remedied with instructions from the Legislature, not the executive branch. Federal spending, surprisingly, is determined through a budget drafted and passed by Congress.\n\nThroughout history, we have seen Congress take its rightful place. President Lincoln would not have reconstructed the Union, and Roosevelt would not have victoriously led us through World War II, without the aid and leadership of Congress. This year, elect a Congress that will work for you, not incumbents who will continue to forget you.\n\nTyler Branz, Orlando\n\n\n\nKilling not fun\n\nWhile watching the local news on television recently, I found one item to be disturbing.\n\nThe reporter was interviewing a couple who participates in the annual alligator hunt. When asked why she does it, the woman replied, \"Because it\u2019s fun.\"\n\nFun? I\u2019ve never thought of the taking of an animal\u2019s life as \"fun.\" Parties are fun, celebrations are fun \u2014 but killing? Fun?\n\nIt makes me uncomfortable that some people feel that way.\n\nChristi Gray, Orlando\n\n\n\nConserving land: What\u2019s not to like?\n\nAmendment 1 is like \"motherhood and apple pie.\" Who wouldn\u2019t want clean water and open land for future generations, all with no new taxes?\n\nNearly 1 million Floridians signed the petition to get it on the Nov. 4 ballot.\n\nDocumentary-stamp taxes on real-estate transactions have been in place since the 1930s, and a portion has been used for conservation land purchases since 1968. Development that was responsible for the loss of open space became the source of funds for conserving open space. Homes near the state\u2019s conservation lands are worth more to future buyers because the adjacent land is protected. There is always that buffer from traffic, air pollution, water-supply problems and a serenity impossible to guarantee otherwise.\n\nFlorida\u2019s ecotourism hosts more than 31 million visitors annually, who generate more than $2.7 billion in direct economic impact and support more than 31,300 jobs.\n\nIn addition to cleansing our water and air, state conservation lands preserve our historical and archaeological heritage, protect fisheries worth an estimated $7.5 billion annually and Florida\u2019s unique wildlife, including more than 500 endangered and threatened species. Wildlife viewing alone is estimated to add $5.6 billion to our state and local economies.\n\nA new focus is acquiring easements, allowing foresters, ranchers and farmers to continue agricultural activities, while conserving resources. Amendment 1 will also provide management funding so that water quality can be restored and adequate, and appropriate public access can be provided.\n\nThere is no downside to Amendment 1. Vote yes.\n\nGreg Brock, retired chief, Office of Environmental Services, Florida Division of State Lands", "article_metadata": {"fb_title": "Feral cats, alligator hunt and land conservation: Letters", "date": "2014-11-02", "googlebot": "index", "copyright": "Copyright (c) 2016 Orlando Sentinel", "author": "Orlando Sentinel", "og": {"site_name": "OrlandoSentinel.com", "description": "Feeding feral cats hurts", "title": "Feral cats, alligator hunt and land conservation: Letters", "url": "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/opinion/os-ed-letters-feral-cats-110214-20141031-story.html", "image": "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54540d5f/turbine/os-ed-letters-feral-cats-110214-20141031", "type": "article"}, "x-servername": "lalvp10.17", "twitter": {"site": "@orlandosentinel", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "index,follow", "keywords": "Orlando Sentinel Letters to the Editor", "fb": {"admins": 100004353067097, "page_id": 5779052556, "app_id": 890804050949750}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=402223551, app-argument=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/deeplinkid/81841666", "googlebot-news": "index", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "news_keywords": "Orlando Sentinel Letters to the Editor", "y_key": "fb73650ad672fe45", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "Description": "Today's Orlando Sentinel Letters to the Editor for Nov. 2, 2014"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf654\"", "article_summary": "Greg Brock, retired chief, Office of Environmental Services, Florida Division of State Lands\nWho wouldn\u2019t want clean water and open land for future generations, all with no new taxes?\nLaine Mcmillan, TitusvilleElect a Congress that will work for youOur legislative branch, or Congress, is the most powerful branch within the U.S. government.\nIf hawks, bears and coyotes are preying on feral cats, as Hall notes, this is one of nature\u2019s built-in check-and-balance mechanisms at work.\nThis year, elect a Congress that will work for you, not incumbents who will continue to forget you."}
