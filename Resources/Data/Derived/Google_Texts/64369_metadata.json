The law\u2019s opponents contend this means that those buying insurance through exchanges set up by the federal government don\u2019t get subsidies.\n\nKagan\u2019s question, however, seemed to suggest those four words should be read in context of the entire law, which clearly aims to provide insurance subsidies for people who need them. From the transcript:\n\nSo I have three clerks, Mr. Carvin [the lawyer for the challengers]. Their names are Will and Elizabeth and Amanda. OK? So my first clerk, I say, Will, I\u2019d like you to write me a memo. And I say, Elizabeth, I want you to edit Will\u2019s memo once he\u2019s done. And then I say, Amanda, listen, if Will is too busy to write the memo, I want you to write such memo. Now, my question is: If Will is too busy to write the memo and Amanda has to write such memo, should Elizabeth edit the memo? [Laughter]\n\nKagan\u2019s question seems to imply the answer is yes, Elizabeth should edit the memo.\n\nREUTERS/Jonathan Ernst Jumaane Cook (bottom R), age 5, of Cleveland, Ohio stands with his father James Cook (obscured, holding sign at R) as they join Obamacare supporters demonstrating at the Supreme Court building in Washington March 4, 2015.\n\nHere\u2019s Kagan\u2019s point: The ACA asked states (in her example, her clerk Will) to set up health exchanges that would get federal subsidies (\u201cedits\u201d by Elizabeth the clerk).\n\nBut the law also specified that the federal government (equivalent to Amanda) could step in and set up the marketplaces if the states couldn\u2019t. Those marketplaces still need the subsidies to operate in the same way the memo needed Elizabeth\u2019s edits.\n\nKagan was not the only justice who had tough questions for the lawyer opposing Obamacare. Justice Anthony Kennedy, a key swing vote, said during oral arguments he saw a \u201cserious Constitutional\u201d issue with the position taken by the latest opponents of the ACA.\n\nHere\u2019s Kennedy\u2019s problem: Under the interpretation put forth by the law\u2019s opponents, states will effectively be coerced into setting up their own exchanges if they want their citizens to have insurance.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s Kennedy\u2019s view of the case, there\u2019s almost no chance that the challengers can win,\u201d UCLA constitutional law professor Adam Winkler told Business Insider.\n\nA decision in this case is expected as soon as Thursday.\n\nNOW WATCH: 11 Facts That Show How Different Russia Is From The Rest Of The World\n\n\n\nFollow Business Insider Australia on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-notification": "frequency=30;polling-uri=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=1;polling-uri2=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=2;polling-uri3=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=3;polling-uri4=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=4;polling-uri5=http://notifications.buildmypinnedsite.com/?feed=http://www.businessinsider.com.au/feed&id=5; cycle=1", "publisher": "Business Insider Australia", "description": "The Supreme Court is expected to issue a...", "application-name": "Business Insider Australia", "author": "Erin Fuchs", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_310_wide.png", "twitter": {"description": "The Supreme Court is expected to issue a...", "title": "Justice Kagan brilliantly exposed a flaw in the huge challenge to Obamacare", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-argument-in-king-v-burwell-obamacare-challenge-2015-6", "image": "http://static.businessinsider.com/image/54f755fb69bedd7e708a9c27/image.jpg", "site": "@BIAUS", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#185f7c", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_70.png", "robots": "noarchive", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_310.png", "og": {"site_name": "Business Insider Australia", "description": "The Supreme Court is expected to issue a...", "title": "Justice Kagan brilliantly exposed a flaw in the huge challenge to Obamacare", "url": "http://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-argument-in-king-v-burwell-obamacare-challenge-2015-6", "image": "http://static.businessinsider.com/image/54f755fb69bedd7e708a9c27-640/image.jpg", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_144.png", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-25T05:06:49+10:00"}, "apple-touch-fullscreen": "yes", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://edge.alluremedia.com.au/assets/img/businessinsider/ms_150.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcea9d\"", "article_summary": "The case will determine whether the US can keep subsidizing health insurance for people in the roughly three dozen states states whose insurance exchanges are run by the federal government.\nAnd then I say, Amanda, listen, if Will is too busy to write the memo, I want you to write such memo.\nThe law\u2019s opponents contend this means that those buying insurance through exchanges set up by the federal government don\u2019t get subsidies.\nNow, my question is: If Will is too busy to write the memo and Amanda has to write such memo, should Elizabeth edit the memo?\nKagan was not the only justice who had tough questions for the lawyer opposing Obamacare."}
