A child is recovering after being shot in the face in Jersey City while his parents were sitting in a car parked on the block.

Surgery at Jersey City Medical Center to remove a bullet from the face of one-and-a-half year old Mina Beshay was successful and he will head home from the hospital with his family Sunday.

It was just before 3 p.m. Saturday when the child's mother went into the post office.

It was then that witnesses heard about a dozen gunshots. A stray bullet struck the family's Lincoln Sedan, shattering the back window, and hitting Mina, who was strapped into a baby seat in the back.

The child was struck with the bullet, and glass cut him under his eye.

"He got hurt in his face, and his left (sic) here bleeding," said the baby's uncle, Michael Beshay.

Michael was at the scene hours later, cleaning up his brother's car, a car that is now part of an unimaginable crime scene.

Officials say it appears a bullet fragment became lodged in the baby's right cheek. The baby's uncle says he got a frantic call from his brother after the infant was shot. Mina's 5-year-old sister was also in the car at the time.

Jersey City Police and emergency units spent hours combing the area for clues, and interviewing witnesses. Officials say so far witnesses have been uncooperative.

Mina was released from surgery on Saturday night, and is expected to be okay.

Officials say Mina was an unintended target. Detectives are still searching for the shooter.
