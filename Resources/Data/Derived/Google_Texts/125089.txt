BRUNSWICK, Maine â€” Two teenagers remain hospitalized at Mid Coast Hospital following a crash Saturday afternoon on Pleasant Street.

The driver of a 2005 Hyundai, 18-year-old Jocelyn Condon, attempted to turn left and cross two lanes of oncoming traffic when the Hyundai was struck by a 2007 Nissan headed east near the Brunswick Diner, Brunswick Police Cmdr. Marc Hagan said Monday.

Condon and 16-year-old Matthew Condon were uninjured, as was the driver of the Nissan, 31-year-old Daniel Hammond of Brunswick.

Two passengers in the Hyundai were taken to Mid Coast Hospital. Jacqueline Bernard, 18, complained of neck pain and Corinne Bernard, 15, complained of head pain, Hagan said.

Both remained at Mid Coast Hospital on Monday morning, according to a hospital spokesman. Their conditions were not immediately available.
