He\u2019s hoping to help people sign up for health insurance before the deadline.\n\n\u201cI tell my team this is the time when we earn our paycheck,\u201d says Flores.\n\nHe says it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll get a lot of signups here on campus \u2013 most college students are on their parents\u2019 insurance plan until they turn 26.\n\nBut Flores says there\u2019s a subset of Austin\u2019s population that he sees signing up in large numbers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people that are self-employed,\u201d he says \u2013 like musicians, for example.\n\nAnd then he says there are Austin\u2019s growing number of entrepreneurs , who often are also self-employed.\n\n\u201cIn fact, we have a meeting this coming Monday with a small business \u2013 with a startup,\u201d Flores says.\n\nSelf-employed folks probably stand to benefit the most from the exchange. Walt Whitlow from Volente, who describes himself as \u201ca self-employed construction guy,\u201d is a good example.\n\nWhitlow went about 15 years without health insurance. Then he found out about the exchange, and he learned he\u2019d get tax credits to help him pay for his premiums.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like a good idea, and it was affordable,\u201d Whitlow says. \u201cSo I went for it and was diagnosed a couple months later with cancer, so it basically saved my butt.\u201d\n\nBut, the exchange is just one piece of the Affordable Care Act coverage puzzle: Because state lawmakers haven\u2019t expanded Medicaid in Texas, uninsured rates are still high.\n\nNew estimates from the Kaiser Family Foundation show Texas has the highest number of uninsured residents nationwide: nearly 4.5 million people.\n\nEstimates for the number of uninsured in Travis County are around 200,000.\n\nUntil Sunday though, musicians, startup employees, entrepreneurs and self-employed construction guys \u2013 and gals \u2013 can still sign up on the federal insurance exchange.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Texas", "description": "Sunday is the last day to buy health insurance for 2016 on the federal health insurance exchange.
