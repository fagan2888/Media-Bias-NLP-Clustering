A growing body of research indicates, the younger they are, the more serious the long-term impact can be, a key concern, making sure the very youngest and pregnant women are getting the proper nutrition.\n\nRELATED LINKS\n\nStarting in 2010, a program under the health care reform law made that idea more of a possibility in many states.\n\nHari Sreenivasan has our report on one effort in Northern Arkansas.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Tori Moon always thought life on her own would look different than this. At 20, she lives in a budget motel in Harrison, Arkansas, eats donated food when it\u2019s available and is now several months pregnant. Without much family in the area and a fianc\u00e9 who works long hours, she spends much of her time feeling alone.\n\nTORI MOON: It was really hard for me to make friends, being pregnant, because we live in the Bible Belt, and a lot of people around here don\u2019t believe in being pregnant before marriage.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: But Moon can count on at least one person dropping by regularly.\n\nEvery other week, Deena Tougaw sits down with Moon to discuss ways of staying healthy during pregnancy.\n\nDEENA TOUGAW, Circle of Life: I want you to write down what you eat for breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, snack.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: They talk about how that can translate into long-term benefits for her child.\n\nTougaw runs the Circle of Life program in Northern Arkansas. It\u2019s one of many home visiting projects throughout the nation that received a big financial boost under the Affordable Care Act to bring basic preventative services directly to low-income families.\n\nDEENA TOUGAW: And the two things that you marked that you don\u2019t get any of would be your dark green or orange-yellow vegetables.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And, quite often, that includes lessons on how to eat better when resources are slim.\n\nIn places like Harrison, a town of about 13,000 in the Ozark Mountains, the barriers to good health for mothers and children can be steep. Poverty and teen pregnancy rates here are among the highest in the nation, and a trip to the store for fruits and vegetables is often a long one.\n\nThat\u2019s why Tougaw and her staff use a portion of their $140,000 budget to drive Moon and others to the grocery store when necessary.\n\nDEENA TOUGAW: Why don\u2019t you go ahead and grab you a bag if you like them?\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: There are currently 38 new or expecting mothers enrolled in the program, and without this kind of help, most would face what the government calls severe food insecurity.\n\nDEENA TOUGAW: So do you just eat cucumbers? You just slice them up and eat them? OK.\n\nTORI MOON: And then I put them in the salads, too.\n\nDEENA TOUGAW: Oh good. OK. So why don\u2019t you grab you several?\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Moon now knows that women who skip meals or don\u2019t eat the right foods may be at greater risk for labor troubles and birth defects. And she takes that seriously, because her first daughter, who was born when Moon was a high school senior, had a rare complication that left the baby\u2019s intestines and stomach outside the body. Given the expensive treatment needed for the baby\u2019s survival, Moon decided to give her up for adoption.\n\nTORI MOON: There\u2019s all different kinds of things that can cause the birth defect that she had. But when I look back at the situation when I was pregnant with her, I wasn\u2019t able to make ends meet with my food stamps. I wasn\u2019t able to get as many fruits \u2014 fruits and vegetables. I wasn\u2019t able to do all that all the time.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: For other families in crisis, the long-term impacts of malnutrition can be more subtle, but just as devastating.\n\nTwo hours South of Harrison, at Arkansas Children\u2019s Hospital in Little Rock, Dr. Patrick Casey has been studying the effects of diet on child health for several decades.\n\nDR. PATRICK CASEY, Arkansas Children\u2019s Hospital: Are you clear on the \u2014 adding the material into the formula?\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: And, since the \u201990s, he\u2019s been pooling his findings with doctors in other parts of the country through the Boston-based group Children\u2019s Health Watch.\n\nDR. PATRICK CASEY: There\u2019s no doubt that food insecurity is associated with poorer general health and well-being, more hospitalizations, lower developmental achievements in preschool children. Iron-deficiency anemia has been found to be more common.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: But there\u2019s also research emerging that indicates the domino effect may start much earlier, that malnutrition during pregnancy can have consequences that last a lifetime for children.\n\nOn one hand, babies born to underweight mothers stand a good chance of being too small themselves, which increases the odds for developmental delays and a variety of chronic conditions later in life. But the other extreme is also common, where a woman gains too much weight because she only has access to cheap and unhealthy foods.\n\nDR. PATRICK CASEY: An overweight mother is more likely to deliver a heavy newborn, and a heavy newborn has a much greater statistical likelihood of being obese as they grow older, or having hypertension and associated medical problems.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Officials say producing better outcomes boils down to a simple calculation, aggressively target at-risk groups like teens with information on how to have a healthy baby and take it to them where they are, including their classrooms.\n\nAt Mills High School on the outskirts of Little Rock, upwards of 10 girls become pregnant each school year. This winter, seniors Isaria Jackson and Keroshi Hendricks are among them. Jackson says she was pretty clueless when she first went to the school nurse for help.\n\nISARIA JACKSON: She was asking me what was wrong, what was wrong with me. And I just finally just came out and just told her. And then she was like, OK. Well, then she sat down, and she went and got out the book, and this nutrition book that we have.\n\nWOMAN: It\u2019s the best thing for you, as well as the baby \u2014 for your baby.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: School nurse Rae Rice considers herself the first line of defense for these girls.\n\nWOMAN: I wanted to first talk to you all about being here at Mills and being pregnant.\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: So she will remind them early and often that their child\u2019s future depends in many ways on their own eating habits, and that when their kids start school themselves in a few years\u2026\n\nWOMAN: Start out with nine. Now, how many pieces were sold?\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: \u2026 they will be better off in almost every way if they received the nutritional base they needed. They will find it easier to concentrate, get along with others, and, down the line, finish school on time.\n\nDEENA TOUGAW: Developmentally, what has he started doing that\u2019s been new?\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Which is why Deena Tougaw says aggressive interventions for at-risk families save society money in the long-run, even if they do involve some up-front costs for programs like hers.\n\nDEENA TOUGAW: Whenever you feed him, does he watch you?\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: In the Circle of Life program, home visits continue through a child\u2019s third birthday to ensure developmental milestones are being met and to take early action if they\u2019re not.\n\nOn this day, baby Isaiah is learning to follow a moving target. But his mom, 17-year-old Jessie Sprinkles, is learning just as much about what to feed him as he grows up. Food is a tough topic for Sprinkles. It hasn\u2019t always been plentiful in her house, and when it\u2019s there, she often binges on the cheap stuff she knows is bad for her. But she wants better for her son.\n\nJESSIE SPRINKLES: I do, because, you know, I don\u2019t want him to eat like me and be \u2014 gain a bunch of weight like I did and stuff when I was a kid, so\u2026\n\nHARI SREENIVASAN: Sprinkles says she has a lot to learn and even more to do to meet that goal. But she now has a better idea of the steps to take and a new reason to try.\n\nThe NewsHour\u2019s Jason Kane produced this segment with the support of the Dennis A.
