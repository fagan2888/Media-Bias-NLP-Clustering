A Wichita gun expert says one part of responsible gun ownership is securing the firearm when not in use.

Brandon Light works for Thunderbird Firearms Academy and wants parents to teach children what to do if they see a gun.

"The simplest thing to tell a child, as soon as they are able to understand and comprehend what a gun is and things like that, is that if they find a gun, stop, don't touch it, leave the area, tell an adult that they found it. It is the best thing that you can teach a kid," Light said.

Light says all new guns sold in the United States of America come with cable locks, that when used properly, prevent a gun from being fired. He says many, larger law enforcement offices will give cable locks for free to anyone that needs one.

There are also safes, vaults and lockers that can be purchased for as little as $30 that can keep a loaded gun ready to be used.

Parents can ask if someone they invited into their home is armed with a gun.

"You have to just ask yourself, why would you even want to not know that that gun is there with your kid in the house, with your kid being accessible to that room," Light said.
