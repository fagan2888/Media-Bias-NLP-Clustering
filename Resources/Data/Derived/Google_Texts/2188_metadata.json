Scott Walker (R) on Friday suggested that denying health coverage to additional low-income Americans helps more people \u201clive the American Dream\u201d because they won\u2019t be \u201cdependent on the American government.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeyond that, I just ask the basic question: Why is more people on Medicaid a good thing?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d rather find a way, particularly for able-bodied adults without children, I\u2019d like to find a way to get them into the workforce. [...]\n\nI think ideologically, that\u2019s a better approach, not just as a conservative, but as an American. Have more people live the American dream if they\u2019re not dependent on the American government.\u201d\n\nI don't know what anti-healthcare conservatives suppose the \"American Dream\" to be, but I've yet to see one aspire to it themselves Denying health coverage to any low-income American would run afoul of living the American Dream primarily because of the living part, of course. Denying the Medicaid expansion is expected to kill thousands of Americans outright , and it's difficult to live the \"American Dream\" as a plastic bag of burnt cinders tossed very respectfully to your next-of-kin. No \"American Dream\" I am familiar with involves being plunged into sudden bankruptcy by the slightest of accidents; I have never heard a child say when I grow up, I am going to get a medically treated condition but then not be able to treat it because my employer does not cover that.Particularly able-bodied adults without children, and screw the rest of them. If you are poor and have a child you are out of luck, and had best hope your janitorial job will allow you to raise young Timmy in the mop bucket while you go about your shift; if you are poor and not able-bodied the American Dream dictates you suck it up, self-amputate whichever of your limbs is giving you the trouble using plastic utensils procured from the nearest fast-food restaurant, and apply for a job at that restaurant as soon as you have cauterized the wound on their industrial grill.Ideologically, it's a wonderful approach. Ideologically, it would be ideal if poor Americans rode unicorns to their fancy Wall Street jobs and got health insurance from the ghost of Ronald Reagan himself, who would smile as he helped them fill out the forms and would then quickly send them off to Jesus Christ to be processed. The chasm between ideologically and practicality is wide, and at the bottom is a slow-moving river of Not Really Giving A Shit. If you are so determined to find an ideological solution to poor Americans dying from preventable diseases and not-poor Americans always one hospital visit away from becoming destitute, it is a clear announcement that the great vast sweep of those Americans and their problems is not concerning enough to bother with a non-ideological solution. Which would be, of course, the crux of the problem here.\n\nI suspect what Gov. Scott Walker really means is that denying healthcare coverage to low-income Americans is necessary for his own American Dream, which is to be a respected and powerful member of a government that would do such things. The American Dream for Scott Walker means rising to a position where you can tell The Poors that they do not really need health care, and if they did need health care they should have thought of that before becoming Poors. The American Dream for Scott Walker is being able to sit in a very nice office and opine on how all of the Americans who are not governors should be happy to die for the cause of Scott Walker's personal ideology, because we are all in this together, you and I, and if you are not willing to be buried in a pauper's grave in order to provide a slight boost to Scott Walker's planned run for the presidency then you are not really a part of the Scott Walker team, now, are you. You should consider your diabetes or heart disease or sick child from a more ideological perspective, and I am sure then you will be able to appreciate how your existence runs afoul of Scott Walker's American Dream.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Daily Kos", "description": "I don't know what anti-healthcare conservatives suppose the \"American Dream\" to be, but I've yet to see ...", "title": "Gov.
