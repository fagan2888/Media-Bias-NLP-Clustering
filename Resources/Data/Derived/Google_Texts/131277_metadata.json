It\u2019s forcing those in their 20s and 30s to take a hard look and see if they can squeeze in coverage to avoid penalties. Many are trying to establish careers or just make progress in a still-bumpy economy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only so far one can dwindle a ramen-noodle diet,\u201d said Christopher Rael of Los Angeles. In his late 20s, Rael is pursuing a degree in sociology and working at a children\u2019s center to pay his bills.\n\nWith open enrollment over after Jan. 31, Rael is hoping his meager income will qualify him for Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid. \u201cI cannot afford an additional bill,\u201d he said. He paid a fine of about $150 for being uninsured in 2014.\n\nThe minimum penalty rises to $695 in 2016 for someone uninsured a full 12 months and not eligible for one of the law\u2019s exemptions. That\u2019s more than double the corresponding figure of $325 for 2015.\n\nIn practice, the fines will be higher for many consumers. That\u2019s because the law sets the penalty as the greater of $695 or 2.5 percent of taxable income this year. A study by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation estimates the average 2016 penalty at $969 per uninsured household.\n\nFines are collected through the tax returns of uninsured people and in most cases deducted from their tax refunds. The penalty amounts will be increased by a cost-of-living factor in future years.\n\nPenalties are the health care law\u2019s nudge to get healthy people into the insurance pool, helping keep premiums manageable for everyone.\n\nUntil now, the administration has mainly stressed the benefits: subsidized premiums and protection from the costs of unanticipated injury or serious illness. But with concerns that many young and healthy people still aren\u2019t sold, officials are invoking the threat of penalties.\n\n\u201cThe tax penalty is bringing more young and healthy consumers into the market,\u201d Andy Slavitt, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said in a recent speech. \u201cWe are using a large portion of our marketing resources to make sure that consumers are aware of the increasing fee for people that go without insurance.\u201d Slavitt\u2019s agency oversees the health care law.\n\nThe pressure of rising fines is butting up against the economic situations of uninsured people, nearly half of whom said in a recent Kaiser poll that they\u2019ve tried but coverage is still too expensive. A big sore point has to do with high deductibles for many health-law insurance plans, which can leave consumers with thousands of dollars in medical bills.\n\nChristina Loucks of Franklin, Tennessee, a small city near Nashville, says the way she figures it, she might still come out ahead financially by paying a $695 fine.\n\nThe insurance plans she\u2019s looked at would cost her about $100 a month in premiums, after subsidies. That works out to around $1,200 a year. But the coverage comes with deductibles of several thousand dollars. If she got seriously ill, she would be on the hook for that before her insurance started paying. Normally, she just goes to the doctor for allergy prescriptions.\n\n\u201cI still see it as I am keeping $500 in my pocket,\u201d said Loucks. The $500 is the difference between a full year of premiums and fine for being uninsured, and that calculation might work if she stays healthy.\n\nIn her 30s, Loucks is holding down two jobs as she tries to find a career that aligns with her interest in literature. She\u2019s still dealing with student loans, not to mention rent and car payments. \u201cI don\u2019t see the benefit for me,\u201d she said.\n\nLoucks said she may wait until the last minute to make up her mind, but Julian Rostain has decided he\u2019ll take a chance on being fined by the IRS.\n\nIn his 20s, Rostain works as a cook at a country club. His dream is to open up his own establishment, serving up \u201cAmerican-French bistro food with Asian undertones.\u201d He lives in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, a farming area not too far from Philadelphia.\n\nRostain\u2019s savings in a rainy-day fund wouldn\u2019t allow him to qualify for expanded Medicaid, and he doesn\u2019t think he can cover insurance premiums on his budget.\n\n\u201cDo you really think people who can\u2019t afford health care should have to pay a penalty?\u201d asks Rostain. The law does offer a low-income exemption, and he\u2019s checking into it.\n\nWhile rising penalties could boost health care sign-ups this year, that\u2019s not likely to win hearts and minds for Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which remains politically divisive.\n\n\u201cWe are talking about paying premium prices for underwhelming health care,\u201d said D.J. Byrnes, a sports blogger from Columbus, Ohio, in his 20s and uninsured. \u201cIf I want to buy something, I want to make sure it\u2019s quality.\u201d\n\nAssociated Press Social Media Editor Eric Carvin contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"description": "WASHINGTON -- Millions of young adults healthy enough to think they don't need insurance face painful choices this year as the sign-up deadline approaches for President Barack Obama's health care law.", "pubdate": 20160126, "og": {"site_name": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Millions of young adults healthy enough to think they don't need insurance face painful choices this year as the sign-up deadline approaches for President Barack Obama's health care law.", "title": "Health care fines press millennials as Jan. 31 deadline nears", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RTX156XV.jpg", "url": "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/health-care-fines-press-millennials-as-jan-31-deadline-nears/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"domain": "PBS NewsHour", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Millions of young adults healthy enough to think they don't need insurance face painful choices this year as the sign-up deadline approaches for President Barack Obama's health care law.", "title": "Health care fines press millennials as Jan. 31 deadline nears", "image": "http://newshour-tc.pbs.org/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/RTX156XV.jpg", "creator": "@newshour", "site": "@newshour", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "fb": {"app_id": 114150878604116}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newshour", "tag": "millennials"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "Affordable Care Act, health care, millennials"}, "article_summary": "While rising penalties could boost health care sign-ups this year, that\u2019s not likely to win hearts and minds for Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, which remains politically divisive.\n\u201cWe are talking about paying premium prices for underwhelming health care,\u201d said D.J.\n\u201cDo you really think people who can\u2019t afford health care should have to pay a penalty?\u201d asks Rostain.\nPenalties are the health care law\u2019s nudge to get healthy people into the insurance pool, helping keep premiums manageable for everyone.\nRostain\u2019s savings in a rainy-day fund wouldn\u2019t allow him to qualify for expanded Medicaid, and he doesn\u2019t think he can cover insurance premiums on his budget."}
