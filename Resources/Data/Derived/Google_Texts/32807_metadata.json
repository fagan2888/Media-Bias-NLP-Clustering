The U.S. Department of Agriculture has labeled the situation a Class II recall, but as of yet there have been no reports of adverse health consequences following the poultry\u2019s consumption.\n\nThe approximately 720 pounds of raw, fresh chicken products recalled are labeled \u201cCookin' Good Whole Young Chickens,\u201d with giblets and necks. An employee working at the processing plant noticed a problem with one of the water valves used in the manufacturing process.\n\nIt seemed that a worker had accidentally used the wrong water valve, resulting in the chickens being treated at fluctuating temperatures. This has put the chickens at risk of contamination. The poultry products found in the warehouse were immediately destroyed. However, nine cases of chickens were processed before the error was caught. These cases were sent to a New York distributor, where they were then shipped for re-sale and foodservice in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.\n\nConsumers have been advised that the chickens were originally processed at the Perdue Food LLC in Salisbury, Md. The products under recall are 80-pound cardboard boxes containing 28, 2.5-pound chickens. The individual packages will bear the establishment number \u201cP-764.\u201d The USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service\u2019s Class II classification categorizes the recalled chicken as \u201ca health hazard situation where there is a remote probability of adverse health consequences from the use of the product.\u201d\n\nAlthough no adverse health consequences have yet been reported, consumers who are displaying any reactions they feel are the direct result of poultry consumption are advised to contact a health care provider. The FSIS have set up a virtual representative available 24 hours a day to address any consumer problems, called Ask Karen.\n\nChicken is considered the most dangerous meat due to its high likeness to cause severe illness. According to LiveScience, between 1998 and 2010 chicken products were linked to 6,996 cases of illness in the United States and 462 outbreaks of foodborne illness. Although poultry is linked to several harmful bacteria, the most common of these is Salmonella. Side effects of Salmonella include: fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Most people recover completely on their own, but in patients who are especially old, young, or already ill, the bacteria could result in death.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "perdue, chicken, recall, 2014, more, 700, pounds, poultry, recalled, after, manufacturing, error", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "The USDA has issued a recall on approximately 720 pounds of chicken product due to possible contamination.", "title": "More Than 700 Pounds Of Perdue Chicken Recalled Due To Contamination Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/perdue-chicken-recall-2014-more-700-pounds-poultry-recalled-after-manufacturing-error-301788", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/08/chicken.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The USDA has issued a recall on approximately 720 pounds of chicken product due to possible contamination.", "title": "More Than 700 Pounds Of Perdue Chicken Recalled Due To Contamination Risk", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/perdue-chicken-recall-2014-more-700-pounds-poultry-recalled-after-manufacturing-error-301788", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/08/chicken.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/09/08/chicken.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-09-08T10:55:28-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-08T10:55:28-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "The USDA has issued a recall on approximately 720 pounds of chicken product due to possible contamination."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcbc18\"", "article_summary": "The approximately 720 pounds of raw, fresh chicken products recalled are labeled \u201cCookin' Good Whole Young Chickens,\u201d with giblets and necks.\nMore than 700 pounds of Perdue chicken has been recalled in parts of the New York metropolitan area due to possible contamination caused by a processing error.\nThe poultry products found in the warehouse were immediately destroyed.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture has labeled the situation a Class II recall, but as of yet there have been no reports of adverse health consequences following the poultry\u2019s consumption.\nAccording to LiveScience, between 1998 and 2010 chicken products were linked to 6,996 cases of illness in the United States and 462 outbreaks of foodborne illness."}
