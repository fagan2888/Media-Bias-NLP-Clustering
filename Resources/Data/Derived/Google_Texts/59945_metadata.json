General, the district\u2019s largest homeless shelter, it\u2019s painful to imagine anyone sleeping inside. Plywood boards up the windows. Over the door, the word \u201chospital\u201d looks as though it has been chipped away to disguise the building\u2019s previous life.\n\nOut front in the cold, mothers with small children stood huddled together outside the family shelter. They have babies on their hips and toddlers at their feet. One little boy peeked up at me from beneath his dinosaur stocking cap.\n\nHe is one of the 600 children living in this shelter, down the road from a morgue, stuck between a jail and a detox clinic. His mother, whose name I didn\u2019t catch, looked to be around my age. Experts like to call us \u201cmillennials,\u201d 20-somethings sorting out the world. She is one of the thousands of homeless peers most of us never consider when grumbling about dead end jobs, skyrocketing rent or lack of fulfillment.\n\nShe\u2019s literally been pushed out of sight, in southeast, D.C., a part of town rarely visited by the roughly 12,500 young adults who move to D.C. each year.\n\nI am one of those transplants. I landed here two years ago and lamented about sleeping in a friend\u2019s laundry room for a week. It seemed like a real war story and I recounted it to fellow millennials at bars and dinner parties.\n\nEntering through a single metal detector into the shelter, a line of young women my age filing in behind me, I couldn\u2019t help feeling ashamed by the fact I\u2019d seldom considered their lives here, without their own apartments. For months they sleep in spaces not much bigger than that laundry room.\n\nThe reality set in. The hallways reek of syrup, pepper and urine covered in bleach. Laminated signs hang on the walls, alerting residents to eat meals in the cafeteria to keep the roaches under control. Inside each room, scratched oak dressers and black bed frames with thin sleeping pads sit atop cold, white linoleum. Some of the women said there was no hot water that day.\n\n\u201cHaving this experience makes you very humble. It makes you see life way out of the box,\u201d Helena Pannell said.\n\nShe stares straight ahead toward a mural on the wall. \u201cIt\u2019s always impossible until it\u2019s done,\u201d it reads. She wore purple jeans and argyle socks with plastic slip-on sandals. She covered her hair with a black shower cap. At 23, her soft brown eyes are heavy and tired. She\u2019s married with four kids, ages 6, 4, 2 and 3 weeks. Bringing a new baby back home to a shelter \u201cis disappointing,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI try as much to keep a smile on my face instead of just crying about everything,\u201d Pannell said scooting toward me. \u201cI try to find a way out.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s in school to be a nurse. Pannell has lived at D.C. General for eight months. The shelter\u2019s $13.8 million-a-year operating budget provides her with three meals a day, a caseworker and a health clinic. Pannell says she rarely eats the food. Instead, she feeds her kids non-perishables she keeps in her room. Sometimes she and her kids get meals at families\u2019 houses to give everyone a break from the shelter.\n\nPannell keeps to herself. She worries her neighbors aren\u2019t the best influences. \u201cWhen you come in here, you have to be mentally strong enough. If you are not, you will slip and fall between the cracks and just be down and out with a lot of other people.\u201d\n\nPannell moved into the shelter after she lost her job. Her student loans from a medical training program piled up, and she found herself pregnant with her fourth child. She lost her apartment and lived with family until she and her husband decided a dilapidated shelter, 20 blocks east of the Capitol, was their best chance at getting a fresh start.", "article_metadata": {"description": "D.C. is a city of the young.
