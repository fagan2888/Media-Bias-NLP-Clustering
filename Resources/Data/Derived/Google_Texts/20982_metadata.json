Simply put: flying is faster than swimming, largely because water is 1,000 times denser than air. Consider that the common MK 46 torpedo makes at best 50 mph, while sea-skimming missiles can do five times that speed.\n\nWhile nature has found a way to accommodate the variety of physical forces that can act upon complex swimming and flying systems, humans have yet to figure this out. Submersible undersea drones, made thick-skinned to withstand water pressures, are generally heavy or equipped with complicated ballast systems. Aerial drones, conversely, are as light as possible, and rarely designed to crash into water.\n\n\u201cFor a submarine to fly, the enclosed air volume, which is the main driver of weight for a submarine, needs to be reduced as much as possible. For an aircraft to land on the water, its structural elements need to be more robust to survive the high impact of splashdown.\u201d Dan Edwards, a principal investigator for NRL, writes in the most recent issue of the lab\u2019s Spectra magazine.\n\nRelated: 9 ISIS Weapons That Will Shock You\n\nUnder its Flimmer program (for \u201cflying swimmer\u201d), the NRLteam built a \u201cTest Sub\u201d \u2014 basically a submarine with wings \u2014and simply worked around the fact that it was heavier than the typical drone. They took it on at least three test runs, dropping it from a plane at 1,000 feet. The test sub flew well enough, according to Edwards\u2019s account, performing \u201cas any other aircraft, controllable in three axes and exhibiting sufficient stability for man-in-the-loop flight.\u201d The team then guided it along the surface of the water at 40 knots (about 46 miles per hour) \u201cbefore sending it beneath the waves where it performed like a regular UUV,\u201d or unmanned underwater vehicle.\n\nThe \u201cTest Sub was guided along a standard approach at an airspeed of approximately 40 knots before splashdown with wings level,\u201d writes Edwards. \u201cUpon touching the water surface, the aircraft saw a dramatic increase in drag and decelerated abruptly. After the splash, Test Sub submerged and started moving underwater and was responsive to human controls \u2026 Test Sub cruises well above 50 knots in the air, while top speed in the water is below 10 knots, illustrating the ultimate benefit of a flying submarine: assuring quick reaction access to underwater areas.\u201d\n\nThe team is experimenting now with floodable wings and more fishlike designs such as the lab\u2019s experimental \u201cWrasse-inspired Agile Near-shore Deformable-fin Automaton,\u201d or WANDA. Built to mimic the movement of a fish called the bird wrasse, the WANDA\u2019s moving fins may prove too fragile for a machine hitting the water at relatively high speed.\n\nRelated: 10 Military Weapons You Won't Believe the Police Have Access To\n\n\u201cA four-finned configuration provides high maneuverability and good stability underwater. In air, however, the fins add weight and are relatively fragile mechanisms that need to be able to survive the forces of splashdown. Bringing all these design elements together is the central challenge of the Flimmer program,\u201d writes Edwards.\n\nThe team has begun to adjust WANDA\u2019s design for flight and will spend the rest of the year fine-tuning and tweaking the design.\n\nThe future of flying fish drones looks neither like a bird, nor a fish, but something new entirely.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Defense One.\n\nRead more in Defense One:\n\nHere's When the Next Incursion in Ukraine Could Happen\n\nU.S. Navy Doesn't Need Expensive Aircraft Carrier Drone\n\nThe World of 2020 According to DARPA", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Nature, which has no need for devices that spy on enemy submarines from the air and un", "title": "The Duck Drone That Could Change the Navy", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/01/Duck-Drone-Could-Change-Navy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/defense-large.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/04/01/Duck-Drone-Could-Change-Navy", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/media/defense-large.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Nature, which has no need for devices that spy on enemy submarines from the air and un", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9332\"", "article_summary": "The future of flying fish drones looks neither like a bird, nor a fish, but something new entirely.\nRelated: This Lethal Laser Could Cripple ISIS and Other EnemiesWhy does the Navy need duck drones?\nThe \u201cTest Sub was guided along a standard approach at an airspeed of approximately 40 knots before splashdown with wings level,\u201d writes Edwards.\nRead more in Defense One:Here's When the Next Incursion in Ukraine Could HappenU.S. Navy Doesn't Need Expensive Aircraft Carrier DroneThe World of 2020 According to DARPA\nSimply put: flying is faster than swimming, largely because water is 1,000 times denser than air."}
