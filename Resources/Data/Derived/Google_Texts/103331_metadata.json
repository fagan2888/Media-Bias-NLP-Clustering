Getty Images.\n\n4763245\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency finally published a regulation that will be the backbone of President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to fight global warming: a sweeping rule called the Clean Power Plan.\n\nAttorneys general from 26 states and numerous business groups, however, aren\u2019t going to stand idly by while EPA regulations threaten the closure of hundreds of coal-fired power plants across the country. A deluge of legal challenges to the Clean Power Plan (CPP) have been filed, alleging the rule violates the Clean Air Act.\n\nOn the political side, a bipartisan group of federal lawmakers are pushing legislation to derail the CPP and force the EPA to go back to the drawing board on how it will regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power plants.\n\nStates and industries representing tens of millions of Americans are rising up to stop Obama\u2019s global warming agenda. It\u2019s a legal effort that rivals the fight against the Affordable Care Act, and one that will likely find its way to the Supreme Court.\n\nEPA Publishes Its Rule To End Coal Power\n\nA slew of lawsuits almost immediately smacked the EPA Friday when it published its final version of the CPP in the Federal Register.\n\nFirst a coalition of 24 states, led by the attorneys general of West Virginia and Texas, filed suit against the EPA, alleging the CPP violated the Clean Air Act because the agency was now regulating power plants under two sections of the law \u2014 which it can\u2019t do.\n\nOklahoma and North Dakota quickly joined those 24 when they filed suit, also arguing the EPA\u2019s rule re-regulated power plants under the Clean Air Act.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an attempt by the administration to transfer decision-making on the fuels used to generate power from state policy makers to bureaucrats at the EPA,\u201d Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, a Republican, said in a statement.\n\nStates suing the EPA also said the CPP would cause electricity prices to spike as coal plants around the country that can\u2019t comply with the rule are shut down and replaced with more expensive natural gas plants or green energy power sources.\n\nThe Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), for example, found \u201cenergy costs for customers may increase by up to 16% by 2030 due to the CPP alone.\u201d\n\nEnergy industry-backed studies claim the CPP could cost Americans between $37 billion a year and $58 billion per year.\n\n\u201cThe results will be financially harmful for states, and consumers ultimately will pay the price through much-higher utility rates and a less reliable power supply,\u201d Pruitt said.\n\nBut not all states are against the CPP. A coalition of 15 states, led by New York\u2019s attorney general, plan on intervening in any lawsuit filed against the CPP. These states will also be joined by Washington, D.C., and New York City \u2014 both of which have spent lots of tax dollars on green energy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just states suing the EPA, however, as they\u2019ve been joined by a coalition of 16 business groups representing a wide range of industries, from paper products to refiners to coal producers. The suit, led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, is also asking federal courts to block the rule from implementation while it\u2019s being challenged.\n\n\u201cNot only are these regulations bad for our economy, they also represent a massive executive power grab,\u201d Tom Donohue, the Chamber\u2019s president, said in a statement. \u201cEPA completely bypassed the legislative branch, basing its 2,000-page rule on roughly 300 words in the Clean Air Act and including a host of policies that have already been considered and rejected by Congress.\u201d\n\nThe CPP has already withstood two legal challenges in federal court this year. The EPA came away from both cases unscathed because judges ruled the CPP needed to be published in the Federal Register before it could be challenged.\n\nEPA and environmentalists maintain the rule can withstand any legal challenge thrown at it because of the \u201cflexibility\u201d the rule gives to states to cut carbon dioxide emissions. EPA is also handing out incentives to states that move quickly to cut emissions the agency blames for causing global warming.\n\n\u201cWe are confident we will again prevail against these challenges and will be able to work with states to successfully implement these first-ever national standards to limit carbon pollution the largest source of carbon emissions in the United States,\u201d EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy said Friday.\n\nCongress Isn\u2019t Happy\n\nFederal lawmakers have also been busy this past week pushing legislation to derail the CPP.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, promised to file a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) this coming week to challenge the CPP.\n\nSens. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican, and Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat, will file a separate CRA resolution to challenge the EPA\u2019s rule.\n\n\u201cI have vowed to do all I can to fight back against this Administration on behalf of the thousands of Kentucky coal miners and their families, and this CRA is another tool in that battle,\u201d McConnell said Friday. \u201cThe CRAs that we will file will allow Congress the ability to fight these anti-coal regulations.\u201d\n\nThe CRA allows Congress to overturn a regulation imposed by a federal agency after it\u2019s been published in the Federal Register. A CRA resolution only needs 51 votes to pass the Senate, meaning Democrats wouldn\u2019t be able to filibuster the bill, but any legislative effort to kill the CPP is likely to meet an Obama veto.\n\nCongress can override, but that would require 67 votes in the Senate. CPP critics are unlikely to persuade the necessary 11 Democrats to join their cause.\n\nOn the House side, Kentucky Republican Rep. Ed Whitfield will file a CRA resolution against the CPP which is likely to pass, but Whitfield may not be able to convince as many as 43 Democrats to override an Obama veto.\n\nIs This The End Of Coal?\n\nThe CPP aims to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants 32 percent by 2030 as part of Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan. In anticipation, the EPA is forcing states to submit plans on how they\u2019ll cut CO2 and ramp up green energy production.\n\nThe Obama administration hopes the CPP and other rules will convince the world the U.S. is serious about tackling global warming and encouraging other major economies, like China and India, to cut their emissions.\n\nAside from trying to appease other countries, the EPA claims the CPP will yield $26 billion to $45 billion in net health and climate benefits from fewer power plants. EPA also claims that shuttering power plants will reduce traditional air pollutants and avoid \u201c3,600 premature deaths \u2026 1,700 heart attacks\u201d and \u201c90,000 asthma attacks\u201d every year.\n\nIn contrast to energy industry studies, EPA says its rule will only cost about $8 billion a year and actually cause electricity prices to fall after 2030 due to energy efficiency programs.\n\nAt the same time, EPA admits the CPP will raise electricity prices 5 percent by 2030 and cause coal production to collapse by 25 percent. EPA also projects as many as 34,000 jobs could be lost by 2030 as the coal industry contacts.\n\nBut other studies show EPA could be vastly underestimating the CPP\u2019s costs. A study by the U.S. Energy Information Administration \u2014 an arm of the Energy Department \u2014 found the CPP will increase electricity prices 3 percent to 7 percent by 2025 from increased natural gas prices.\n\nOn a regional level, however, electricity prices increases could be more severe. EIA noted in \u201cFlorida and the Southeast, the Southern Plains, and the Southwest regions the projected electricity prices in 2030 are roughly 10% above baseline.\u201d\n\nEIA also found that coal production will collapse 30 percent in the next decade as 90 gigawatts of coal-fired power capacity is shuttered due to the CPP and other EPA rules.\n\nBut even EIA\u2019s estimates may underestimate the impacts on Americans. A National Black Chamber of Commerce study published in June claims the CPP will \u201cincrease Hispanic poverty by more than 26% and Black poverty by more than 23%\u201d as energy prices increase.\n\nThe NBCC study found Americans will pay $565 billion more for energy every year by 2030 than in 2012 because of the CPP \u2014 that\u2019s a 121 percent increase in power prices. The study also found the CPP will \u201c[r]equire the average family to pay over $1,225 more for power and gas in 2030 than they did in 2012.\u201d\n\nFollow Michael on Facebook and Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
