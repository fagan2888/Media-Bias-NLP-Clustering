Interoperability, he added, is a \"high priority at the highest level of government and should be throughout healthcare.\"\n\nCMS is furthering the goal of simplifying quality measurement in part through its recently proposed rule tackling the initial implementation of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, Slavitt said, noting that thanks to these new policies, the U.S. is on track to have alternative payment models be the dominant payment programs by 2018.\n\nYet he also pointed out that like first- and second-generation iPhones, alternative payment models still must be refined based on feedback from industry stakeholders.\n\n\"We should all take a step back and recognize that all of them are still in their early stages,\" Slavitt said. \"I think it would be a mistake to view these models as fully calibrated incentives.\"\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nONC seeks guidance on measuring interoperability under MACRA\n\nCMS releases MACRA rule proposal\n\nHHS touts 'historic' gain of 20M covered through Affordable Care Act\n\nFeds reach alternative payment goal ahead of schedule\n\nAHA16: Experts say insurer mergers bad for providers, consumers\n\nAHA16: Leaders must navigate politics, embrace change", "article_metadata": {"description": "As they discussed their health policy priorities Tuesday at the American Hospital Association's annual conference, two top officials in the Obama administration emphasized the federal government wants to collaborate with healthcare leaders as it strives to transform the delivery system.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "As they discussed their health policy priorities Tuesday at the American Hospital Association's annual conference, two top officials in the Obama administration emphasized the federal government wants to collaborate with healthcare leaders as it strives to transform the delivery system.", "title": "AHA16: Andy Slavitt says CMS wants to help hospitals drive change", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/aha16-andy-slavitt-says-cms-wants-help-hospitals-drive-change/2016-05-03", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "AHA16,alternative payment models,American Hospital Assocation,Andy Slavitt,Care Delivery,Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,Dennis McDonough,Fierce exclusive,Health Information Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,MACRA,Patient Care & Outcomes", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Care Delivery,Health Information Management,Legal / Regulatory / Risk Management,Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Yet he also pointed out that like first- and second-generation iPhones, alternative payment models still must be refined based on feedback from industry stakeholders.\nThus, he said, for the millions of Americans who work in the healthcare industry, \"affordable care is now part of everyone's job.\"\nYet while the ACA's health insurance coverage gains and delivery system reforms are laudable, CMS wants to be more than a federal policymaker and the country's largest payer, Slavitt said.\n\"We should all take a step back and recognize that all of them are still in their early stages,\" Slavitt said.\n\"We want to be seen as an ally that helps you thrive in the midst of all this change.\""}
