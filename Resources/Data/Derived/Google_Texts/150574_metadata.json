Despite that initial confession, I spent the next years mostly in the HIV closet, like a bird in a cuckoo clock that only comes out every third hour.\n\nI met the stranger at the bar in New York, where I live. It was a scant 30 minutes after my doctor had delivered my test results over the phone: \u201cThe good news is you don\u2019t have gonorrhea. The bad news is you\u2019re HIV positive. But these days it\u2019s a manageable condition.\u201d That was 2002 and I was 34. I came of age sexually in the mid-1980s, when AIDS was a deadly epidemic and safe sex was protocol for gay men. I had a domineering and fiercely protective mother, Mama Jean, who warned me that \u201ca moment\u2019s pleasure isn\u2019t worth a lifetime of regret.\u201d\n\nFeeling as if I\u2019d been hit by a two-by-four, I did what I did best in times of crisis: I headed to a bar near my apartment in New York. I felt someone watching me as I downed my second martini. My face must have looked like a Picasso, all the features in a tortured jumble. The stranger asked me what was the matter, and I told him. Through sobs that would put Lucille Ball to shame, I melodramatically cried, \u201cAnd the worst part: No one will ever have sex with me again!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d he said with a smile. \u201cI will.\u201d\n\nHe took me around the corner to a porno bookstore and proved he was a man of his word. I understood then what Blanche Dubois meant when she said, \u201cWhoever you are, I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.\u201d\n\nAfterward, drunk and shell-shocked, I went home and waited for Michael, my longtime boyfriend and partner. (Like many gay male couples, we have an open relationship.) As soon as he saw my Picasso face he asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d My lips curled inside my mouth as the tears started to flow again. He maintained his unflappable poker face. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had an HIV test. I\u2019m positive.\u201d The dam broke again.\n\n\u201cOh no.\u201d His face cracked \u2013 a hairline fracture \u2013 but it cracked.\n\nI guttural cried as he held me and caressed my head. Michael, who remains negative, has stood by my side ever since.\n\nA week later I told Mr. Parker, my best friend since college. I told him at Marie\u2019s Crisis piano bar, the site of many heart-to-hearts for us. We got stinking drunk and belted show tunes \u2013 \u201cWhat I Did for Love,\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t Cry for Me Argentina,\u201d \u201cEverything\u2019s Coming Up Roses.\u201d The songs felt painfully prescient or woefully ironic. I made him promise not to tell anyone else. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019d be some clucking.\u201d The implication was that friends would judge me for my promiscuity. I silently promised myself to never tell my parents.\n\nAfter that I kept the news in the figurative bottle for the next four years until my problems with the literal bottle forced me into rehab and a step farther out of the HIV closet.\n\nAt rehab, everyone was required to testify before the group their 10 consequences of drinking. I rattled mine off in ascending order of importance: biting my assistant on the neck at a party; shouting \u201cI piss on my inner child!\u201d in a crowded restaurant; getting rolled by handsome strangers; losing my job; attempting suicide. When I got to No. 1 on the list, I needed the drum roll from \u201cThe Late Show With David Letterman.\u201d \u201cAnd No. 1 of the Top Ten Consequences of Jamie\u2019s Drinking \u2026 Becoming HIV-positive!\u201d\n\nI felt ashamed that I got it, because I should have known better. I felt ashamed that people would know how I got it. I felt ashamed of my self-pity when so many before me who were not lucky enough to be alive when anti-viral drugs became available and died miserable deaths, lived angst-ridden lives in fear of miserable deaths, or suffered the hellish side effects of early drug regimens.\n\nThe shame turned to fear. Am I crazy? I thought. It\u2019s one thing to tell a roomful of other alcoholics the exploits of my drinking since many of these strangers had done the same things or worse. But why tell them that I\u2019m positive? They might judge me.\n\nI shut up about HIV for another six years. I told people with whom I hooked up, but even then I thought, I\u2019m telling a complete stranger what I won\u2019t tell my mother. But then again the first person I told was a complete stranger. HIV makes strange bedfellows.\n\nWhen friends would mention they were positive as casually as I might say, \u201cI\u2019m a Capricorn. I\u2019m an alcoholic. I\u2019m a Joan Crawford nut,\u201d I felt like a fraud and a coward, a liar by omission. When other recovering alcoholics mentioned their HIV status while sharing at a sober meeting, I never raised my hand to say that I identified. I remained silent, sitting not in judgment of the person who shared, but in harsh judgment of myself.", "article_metadata": {"description": "I was a proud gay man, but I hid a terrible shame.
