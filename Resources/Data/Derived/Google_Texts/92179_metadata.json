At $62.6 million, the Brewers are last in the major leagues for the first time since 2004, the last season before Mark Attanasio bought the club.\n\nDodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw, at $33 million, is the highest-paid player for the second straight year. Former teammate Zack Greinke, who left to sign with Arizona, is second at $31.8 million, followed by Boston pitcher David Price at $30 million.\n\nThe Dodgers began the season at $233.9 million, down from a record $270.2 million when 2015 began. The New York Yankees, No. 1 for 15 straight years before the Dodgers\u2019 payroll surge, are second at $225 million followed by Detroit ($196 million), Boston ($190 million) and San Francisco ($173 million).\n\nThe average for the 864 players on opening-day rosters, the disabled list and the restricted list was $4,381,980, and the percentage increase was the lowest since a 4.1 rise in 2012.\n\nBut if Atlanta had not released Nick Swisher and Michael Bourn in the last week and if Tampa Bay had kept James Loney, the average would have been up 5.4 percent to nearly $4.43 million.", "article_metadata": {"description": "AP Newsbreak: MLB average salary $4.4M after 4.4 pct rise", "author": "Ronald Blum", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "AP Newsbreak: MLB average salary $4.4M after 4.4 pct rise", "title": "AP Newsbreak: MLB average salary $4.4M after 4.4 pct rise", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/04/03/ap_newsbreak_mlb_average_salary_4_4m_after_4_4_pct_rise/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/cubs-mets-baseball.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "AP Newsbreak: MLB average salary $4.4M after 4.4 pct rise", "creator": "@salon", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/04/cubs-mets-baseball.jpeg1-1280x960.jpg", "title": "AP Newsbreak: MLB average salary $4.4M after 4.4 pct rise", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "AP Newsbreak: MLB average salary $4.4M after 4.4 pct rise", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Among rebuilding teams, Philadelphia cut spending by $43 million, Milwaukee by $40 million and Cincinnati by nearly $27 million.\nDodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw, at $33 million, is the highest-paid player for the second straight year.\n1 for 15 straight years before the Dodgers\u2019 payroll surge, are second at $225 million followed by Detroit ($196 million), Boston ($190 million) and San Francisco ($173 million).\nThe Dodgers began the season at $233.9 million, down from a record $270.2 million when 2015 began.\nThe Chicago Cubs boosted payroll by $51 million, adding Jason Heyward, John Lackey and Ben Zobrist in an effort to win their first title since 1908."}
