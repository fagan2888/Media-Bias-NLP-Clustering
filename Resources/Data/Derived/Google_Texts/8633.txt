The White House honored 11 ambitious young women Tuesday who are impacting their communities with their courageous leadership. These "Champions of Change" are all multicultural women and are managers in various industries such as technology, health care, education and agriculture.

The most senior women in the Obama administration, Valerie Jarrett, Tina Tchen, Alejandra Ceja spoke and commended the honorees for taking on huge responsibilities at such young ages and said their investments in their communities are also investments to the country, as a whole.

Asha Abdi, Marissa Jennings and Faatimah Knight were the three African-American women who were recognized. Since 2010, Abdi has served the Somali and Muslim community by creating programs that enhance the lives of first generation Somali Americans.

During a panel at the ceremony, moderated by Franchesca Ramsey, host of MTV News' Decoded, Abdi said she's inspired by women who've done amazing things and she adopts the characteristics of those women.

Knight raised funds for black churches across the South that were burned down due to arson. Through a campaign called #RebuildwithLove, she gained enormous attention and in less than three weeks, raised over $100,000 for four black churches with the help from Muslim charities.

Jennings is the founder of SOCIALgrlz LLC, the first mobile web publishing company creating content exclusively for African-American girls ages 13-17. Her tech start-up acts as a voice for African-American girls through modern technology. And currently, she's developing an app with Microsoft that's being tested by the all-girls school St. Mary's Academy in New Orleans.
