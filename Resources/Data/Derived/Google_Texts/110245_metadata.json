Trey Gowdy into the race.\n\nGowdy, who continues to spearhead the high-profile investigations into Hillary Clinton\u2019s email controversy and handling of Benghazi, sidestepped leadership calls by mid-afternoon despite a \u201cDraft Gowdy\u201d campaign brewing in the House.\n\n\u201cWe have good, strong candidates, but Trey Gowdy is unique in his ability to bring the most conservative members together with the most moderate,\u201d Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, told Fox News Tuesday.\n\nRep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., threw his support behind Gowdy earlier in the day but later said after meeting with him it was \u201cclear\u201d he would not run for the position.\n\nShortly after, Gowdy\u2019s office said his focus would remain on chairing the select Benghazi Committee through its investigation into the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya.\n\nIf Gowdy remains unconfirmed, Scalise will likely face Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., in what is expected to be a heated contest for the no. 2 leadership position following Speaker John Boehner\u2019s resignation announcement.\n\nIn a letter hand-delivered to his Republican colleagues Monday night, Scalise emphasized party and chamber cohesion during a time when \u201cour country and our conference are at a crossroads.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand from experience that unity is easy to call for, but it takes the right kind of leadership to achieve,\u201d Scalise wrote.\n\n\u201cAs both Republican Study Committee Chairman and Majority Whip, I\u2019ve made it a top priority to bring openness and inclusiveness into the legislative process so we can bring our dynamic conference together as we advance our agenda,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Louisiana congressman, who currently holds the GOP\u2019s no. 3 post, was pinned as a natural successor for the leadership spot after current House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced his candidacy to replace Boehner as speaker.\n\nBut Scalise\u2019s rise faced a setback after Price secured heavy endorsements from Republican Reps. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Jeb Hensarling of Texas\u2014who waived his own leadership bid to throw his weight behind Price\u2014Monday.\n\n\u201cTom has a proven record of advancing conservative solutions and principles,\u201d Ryan said in a statement. \u201cHe has the knowledge and skills needed to be an effective majority leader, and I\u2019m proud to support him.\u201d\n\nPrice positioned himself to Scalise\u2019s right, calling for a status quo shakeup that advances \u201ca smaller, more limited, more accountable government.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have a real opportunity to spark a great American revival\u2014where our nation is secure, government is limited, our people are prosperous and men and women are free,\u201d Price wrote in an email to congressional Republicans Monday.\n\nPrice and Scalise sparred earlier this year during budget negotiations that pit Republican leadership against conservatives on the House Budget Committee.\n\nPrice, who chairs the committee, challenged pressure from GOP leaders in March to prop up defense funding without offsetting the spending elsewhere in the budget. He argued that any budget adding to the deficit would die on the House floor.\n\nScalise and Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry circumvented Price to personally check the vote count with committee members in hopes that the provision would secure support from defense hawks, The Hill reported.\n\nScalise claimed he had the votes, but the amendment ultimately failed as Price had predicted, and Scalise\u2019s unusual move to personally confirm votes brought tension with the committee\u2019s conservative members.\n\nBoehner said Tuesday he has not yet decided when leadership elections will take place, but he added that he \u201cwould hope to make an announcement in the next day or two about that.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "House Majority Whip Steve Scalise formally declared his bid for majority leader Tuesday as GOP members swiftly moved to pull Rep.
