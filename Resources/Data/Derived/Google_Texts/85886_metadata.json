He's concerned that if the governor's cuts are approved by the General Assembly, \"a number of these collaboratives would wilt away.\"\n\nThe parent program, called the Parent Trust Fund, involves training for parents on how to advocate for their children and participate in civic life. Cutting this program would save $500,000 each year.\n\nConnecticut Parent Power, an advocacy organization, has also publicly opposed the governor's plan to eliminate this program.\n\nIn addition to cutting the parent trust fund, Malloy is also suggesting to cut the early childhood program to save $750,000. This initiative helps each town or city develop their own system to address problems such as low birth weight, childhood obesity, and illiteracy.\n\nGay said that the state's money is broken down into small $20,000 grants to towns. A matching grant from a non-profit is contingent on the state money, so the cuts would effectively be doubled.\n\nResearch has shown that early childhood programs are important for intellectual development. Malloy cited this fact in his recent proposal to mandate full-day kindergarten across the state.\n\nThe cuts represent less than a half of a percent of the $590 million of Malloy's proposed reductions.", "article_metadata": {"category": "Education", "description": "At least two groups are urging the Connecticut General Assembly to protect services that improve parent engagement and that help municipalities plan for", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://wnpr.org/post/agencies-urge-state-legislators-protect-early-childhood-and-parent-programs", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/wnpr/files/styles/medium/public/201310/parent%2520training%2520program.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "At least two groups are urging the Connecticut General Assembly to protect services that improve parent engagement and that help municipalities plan for", "title": "Agencies Urge State Legislators to Protect Early Childhood and Parent Programs"}, "story_id": 394903796, "twitter": {"site": "@wnpr", "card": "summary", "creator": "@savingej"}, "author": "David DesRoches", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "Agencies Urge State Legislators to Protect Early Childhood and Parent Programs"}, "nid": 37878, "datePublished": "2015-03-23", "keywords": "The Daily, Connecticut legislature, budgets, parenting, children", "wordCount": 347, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd0325\"", "article_summary": "In addition to cutting the parent trust fund, Malloy is also suggesting to cut the early childhood program to save $750,000.\nResearch has shown that early childhood programs are important for intellectual development.\nAt least two groups are urging the Connecticut General Assembly to protect services that improve parent engagement and that help municipalities plan for early childhood education.\nThe parent program, called the Parent Trust Fund, involves training for parents on how to advocate for their children and participate in civic life.\nGay is the executive director of Connecticut Early Childhood Alliance."}
