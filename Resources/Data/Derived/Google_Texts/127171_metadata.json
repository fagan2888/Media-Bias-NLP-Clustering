That\u2019s why I\u2019ve developed this unique new program for managing your debt. It\u2019s called, Don\u2019t Buy Stuff You Can\u2019t Afford.\u201d\n\nAccording to the prevailing story, debt is caused by lavish and irresponsible spending by poor and middle-class families. But like much \u201cconventional wisdom,\u201d an increasing amount of evidence belies this point. In fact, the decline of saving and the rise of debt was an almost inevitable consequence of families trying to scrape by in the face of rising inequality. This is the corollary of French economist Thomas Piketty\u2019s now-famous observation: While capital is increasingly concentrated at the top, it turns out that debt is becoming concentrated at the bottom.\n\nIn the same \u201cSNL\u201d bit, Amy Poehler says, \u201cThere\u2019s a whole section in here about buying expensive things using money you save.\u201d This supposedly common-sense observation is mirrored elsewhere. The American Institute of CPAs runs an advertising campaign urging people to \u201cFeed the Pig.\u201d One such ad depicts a responsible couple studiously saving for a house, while another eats lobster, receives massages and then complains about \u201cnever having enough to put away.\u201d Underlying both the real commercial and the satirical one is the idea that those who aren\u2019t saving could do so, but are instead spending the money. But the evidence for this story is weak.\n\nA more compelling story is that inequality has made it harder for households at the middle and bottom to save. In fact, the decline in savings has coincide with a rise in income inequality (see chart). There is evidence that these trends are connected.\n\nAmerican households falling in the bottom third of income growth from 1999 to 2007 accounted for a full half of the decline in the overall saving rate over the same period, according to the IMF. Meanwhile, a 2012 Demos study finds that \u201c40 percent of households used credit cards to pay for basic living expenses such as rent or mortgage bills, groceries, utilities, or insurance, in the past year because they did not have enough money in their checking or savings account.\u201d Another 2012 study finds that \u201cregions or periods with higher inequality are characterized not only by a more unequal distribution of saving rates but also by lower saving rates for most of the income distribution.\u201d\n\nOne of the myths of the right has been that if the rich have more money, they\u2019ll save and invest more as a result, thereby stimulating the economy. That is, more inequality will lead to more national saving. In fact, the data shows that inequality just concentrates wealth in the hands of the few. It also points to the important possibility that the increase in income inequality is what drove the savings rate down to begin with, by also increasing disparities in wealth.\n\nWealth serves as a buffer for an income shock, like losing a job or a medical emergency; it also constitutes a family\u2019s retirement income and the means for funding children\u2019s education. However, the rise in income inequality has been coupled with a rise in wealth inequality, meaning that wealth is increasingly concentrated in the hands of the few. Recently, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman have shown the increase of wealth inequality in the United States (source).", "article_metadata": {"description": "Those who fall into debt are shamed for spending irresponsibly.
