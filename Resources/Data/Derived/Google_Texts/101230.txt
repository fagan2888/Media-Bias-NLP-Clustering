JEFFERSON COUNTY, Colo. -- A tire-slashing spree is under investigation in Jefferson County.

The sheriff's office says vandals slashed 2 tires on 13 cars overnight Wednesday in the area of South Holman Way in southeast Golden.

Vandals used knives to make 1-inch cuts, but they were enough to flatten the tires and make the cars undrivable.

Each of the 13 cars had 2 tires ruined on either the driver's side or the passenger's side.
