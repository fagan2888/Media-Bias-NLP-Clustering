Prior to 2013, the deduction was limited to excess of your qualified expenses above 7.5% of adjusted gross income (AGI), a daunting threshold for most. And now the floor for medical deductions has been raised to 10% of AGI (remaining at 7.5% for taxpayers age 65 or over, but only through 2016).\n\nThis means it will usually take at least one significantly large expense to push a taxpayer over the deduction threshold. But it\u2019s still possible and it doesn\u2019t have to be a calamity either. In fact, the family might even benefit from some summer recreation at the same time.\n\nHere\u2019s the background information: To qualify as a deductible medical expense, the cost must be incurred primarily for prevention or alleviation of a physical or mental defect or illness. On the other hand, if the expense is merely beneficial to your general health or well-being, you can\u2019t deduct the cost. For example, if you install a swimming pool for your children to frolic in during the warm weather, no deduction is allowed, even though they\u2019re getting some much-needed exercise away from their video games and computers.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a silver tax lining if the pool is needed by a family member to alleviate arthritis or some other specific illness. For a medically-necessary improvement made by a homeowner, the deductible amount is equal to the cost above the corresponding increase in the home's value. In addition, the annual maintenance costs associated with the pool \u2014 chlorine, repairs, utilities, cleaning services, etc. -- also qualify for the deduction. Note that the entire cost of a qualified improvements, plus the maintenance costs, is deductible by tenants.\n\nSuppose that your client has an AGI of $150,000 and $12,000 in unreimbursed medical expenses in 2014. His doctor has ordered him to start swimming laps in a pool to improve a heart condition. The client builds an in-ground pool in his backyard for $25,000, but a local realtor says it will increase the value of the home by only $15,000. Previously, the client could not claim any medical expense deduction because the $12,000 total is less than 10% of his AGI, or $15,000. But when he adds the $10,000 write-off for pool, the total increases to $22,000. Now he can deduct $7,000 in medical expenses ($22,000 - $15,0000) on Schedule A of Form 1040.\n\nA few other common examples of home improvements that may be deductible as medical expenses are air conditioning installed to alleviate a child's asthma, an elevator constructed for an adult who can\u2019t walk up stairs and special modifications for a disabled person. Again, no deduction is allowed for purely cosmetic changes.\n\nBest approach: Obtain a written appraisal from an independent real estate professional establishing the increase in a home's value due to an improvement. Also, if a physician prescribes a home improvement to alleviate or treat a medical condition, get the recommendation in writing. Keep these documents on file in case the IRS ever challenges the deduction.", "article_metadata": {"description": "However, there\u2019s a silver tax lining if the pool is needed by a family member to alleviate arthritis or some other specific illness.
