Chris Christie appeared on ABC’s This Week this morning and George Stephanopoulos subjected him to a 10-minute grilling on why he suddenly has no problem with all the things he was warning people about regarding Donald Trump months ago.

Christie is now endorsing Trump, and Stephanopoulos spent pretty much the whole interview going through all the things that Christie was ripping The Donald over during the campaign––his Muslim ban, the Mexican border wall, and Social Security.

Christie had said over and over on the campaign trail that Trump isn’t specific and more people need to ask him how he will get things done.

Christie insisted today that on the wall, “he will do it,” and despite entitlement reform being a big issue for him, he insisted to Stephanopoulos that he’s still supporting Trump despite his position about not even touching Social Security.

Stephanopoulos grilled Christie on exactly how Trump will do the things he says. Christie said he will eventually explain, and complained about how the media treats Trump differently than everyone else.

And on the Muslim ban, Christie said that Trump has “backed off that position.” Stephanopoulos was taken aback by that.
