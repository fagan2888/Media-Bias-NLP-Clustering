The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has announced a special enrollment period for individuals and families who did not have health coverage in 2014 and are subject to the fee or “shared responsibility payment” when they file their 2014 taxes in states which use Federally-facilitated Marketplaces.

This special enrollment period will allow those who were unaware or didn’t understand the implications of this requirement to purchase health insurance coverage from March 15 to April 30.

Consumers can find out if they are eligible for this special enrollment period by visiting https://www.healthcare.gov/get-coverage or by calling the Marketplace Call Center at 1-800-318-2596.

For more details, see CMS’ announcement.
