Darkness isnâ€™t stopping the hunt for the two killers who escaped from a maximum-security prison eight days ago in upstate New York.

State police remained stationed overnight Saturday and into Sunday at intervals everywhere in the wooded search area, which came alive with the loud chirps of crickets and frogs. Along Route 3, a two-lane highway south of Dannemora that abuts the Saranac River, a series of lights illuminated both the roadway and fields where earlier hundreds of officers had conducted more grid searches. Troopers said more than 800 law-enforcement officers were still taking part in the operation.

State police say investigators will continue to search door-to-door and plan to expand the search further east on Sunday.
