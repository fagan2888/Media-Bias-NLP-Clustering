For the last six years, Pruitt has painted a portrait of Obama for each day he\u2019s been in office to create a record of his presidency.\n\n\"I committed myself to tracking the presidency with one painting per day from an unbiased perspective,\u201d Pruitt told The Huffington Post in an email. \"An image of the President deep in thought walking through the Rose Garden is painted with the same attention to detail and mid-range palette as the signing of the [Affordable Care Act].\"\n\nWhile some debate the impact and legacy of Obama's presidency, Pruitt busies himself with his day-by-day chronicle. He chooses the portrait he will paint each day by using Google's image search, and is aiming to continue adding to his presidential portfolio until Obama leaves the White House. By the time that happens, Pruitt will have produced 2,922 paintings.\n\n\u201cI recognize that feelings for the President have fluctuated and that is interesting, but this is a story which hasn't been written entirely,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cThere's still over a year and a half to go. Everyone is always in such a rush to determine a president's legacy.\u201d\n\nPruitt has painted scenes ranging from the Obama family\u2019s private moments to the president's public speeches.\n\nInstallation detail from \"The Obama Paintings.\" Courtesy of the artist, Gavin Brown's enterprise and MOCAD.\n\nPruitt paints each portrait with a red and blue gradient as its background, he then paints the image onto the canvas in white. Pruitt said he purposely used muted versions of the colors on the American flag, \u201chopefully bringing to mind that weathered, time-worn quality that we commonly associate with stone monuments.\u201d The whole piece is meant to function as a monument to Obama \u201cwith an approach that eschews an overarching, singular quality -- something that views the presidency in its entirety.\u201d\n\nInstallation detail from \"The Obama Paintings.\" Courtesy of the artist, Gavin Brown's enterprise and MOCAD.\n\nThe paintings catch viewers\u2019 eyes at random before receding into the sea of soft red and blue. They're not ordered sequentially, which makes it difficult to trace the historical narrative in the images or see how Pruitt's style has changed throughout his project.\n\nInstallation detail from \"The Obama Paintings.\" Courtesy of the artist, Gavin Brown's enterprise, and MOCAD.\n\nMany of the paintings aren't displayed on the walls -- 1,000 of the exhibition pieces are stored in a custom shelving unit in the gallery because there are so many of them.\n\nInstallation detail from \"The Obama Paintings.\" Courtesy of the artist, Gavin Brown's enterprise and MOCAD.\n\nInstallation detail from \"The Obama Paintings.\" Courtesy of the artist, Gavin Brown's enterprise and MOCAD.\n\nPruitt said Detroit was the \u201cideal city\u201d to debut his Obama paintings.\n\n\u201cThe story of 21st century Detroit is an important part of Obama\u2019s legacy, and I think the city\u2019s struggles are indicative of the broader issues our country is facing,\u201d he said.\n\nPruitt has streamlined his painting process, \u201cso it becomes more like a task or a part of [his] daily routine, like exercising.\u201d Still, he spends an hour on each portrait, adding up to more than 95 full days spent working on Obama portraits over six years, more time than most people have spent looking closely at the president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve actually witnessed anything that others haven\u2019t noticed before me,\u201d he said. \u201cThat being said, he seems older! Wiser, maybe? He still smiles and laughs a lot, which is nice to see.\u201d\n\nInstallation detail from \"The Obama Paintings.\" Courtesy of the artist, Gavin Brown's enterprise and MOCAD.\n\nInstallation detail from \"The Obama Paintings.\" Courtesy of the artist, Gavin Brown's enterprise and MOCAD.\n\nInstallation detail from \"The Obama Paintings.\" Courtesy of the artist, Gavin Brown's enterprise and MOCAD.\n\nInstallation detail from \"The Obama Paintings.\" Courtesy of the artist, Gavin Brown's enterprise and MOCAD.\n\nInstallation detail from \"The Obama Paintings.\" Courtesy of the artist, Gavin Brown's enterprise and MOCAD.", "article_metadata": {"description": "At first glance, it\u2019s hard to pick out the details of the two-tone paintings covering the walls of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Detroit in an unbrok...", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-06-12 13:08:09 -0400", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "At first glance, it\u2019s hard to pick out the details of the two-tone paintings covering the walls of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Detroit in an unbrok...", "title": "Artist Has Made 2,300 Paintings Of Obama, Still Going", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/11/rob-pruitt-obama-paintings_n_7532904.html", "image": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3043998/images/o-PRUITT-PORTRAIT-INSTALL-facebook.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "At first glance, it\u2019s hard to pick out the details of the two-tone paintings covering the walls of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Detroit in an unbrok...", "creator": "KABBEYL", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://i.huffpost.com/gen/3043998/images/o-PRUITT-PORTRAIT-INSTALL-facebook.jpg", "height": 1000}, "title": "Artist Has Made 2,300 Paintings Of Obama, Still Going", "site": "@HuffPostArts", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-06-11 13:08:09 -0400", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=7532904", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "arts", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Rob Pruitt,rob pruitt obama,rob pruitt obama paintings,rob pruitt mocad,obama paintings,Obama art,obama,Barack Obama,rob pruitt barack obama,painting,detroit art", "article": {"section": "Arts", "tag": "Rob Pruitt,rob pruitt obama,rob pruitt obama paintings,rob pruitt mocad,obama paintings,Obama art,obama,Barack Obama,rob pruitt barack obama,painting,detroit art", "published_time": "2015-06-11 13:08:09 -0400", "modified_time": "2015-06-11 13:59:02 -0400"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7deb\"", "article_summary": "\u201cThe Obama Paintings\u201d exhibition, which opened at MOCAD last month, shows a staggering 2,300 of New York artist Rob Pruitt\u2019s pieces.\nCourtesy of the artist, Gavin Brown's enterprise and MOCAD.\nHe still smiles and laughs a lot, which is nice to see.\u201dInstallation detail from \"The Obama Paintings.\"\nCourtesy of the artist, Gavin Brown's enterprise, and MOCAD.\nFor the last six years, Pruitt has painted a portrait of Obama for each day he\u2019s been in office to create a record of his presidency."}
