He had a disease, and to stay alive, he\u2019d have to attend AA meetings and abstain from alcohol for the rest of his life, they said.\n\nBut instead, they turned to a group of psychologists who specialize in treating substance use and other compulsive behaviors at the Center for Motivation and Change.\n\nThe center is part of a growing wing of addiction treatment that rejects the AA model of strict abstinence as the sole form of recovery for alcohol and drug users.\n\nIt uses a suite of techniques that provide a hands-on approach to emotional and behavioral problems, rather than having abusers forever swear off the substance \u2014 a particularly difficult step for young people.\n\n\u201cThe traditional language often sets parents up to feel they have to make extreme choices: Either force them into rehab or detach until they hit rock bottom,\u201d said Dr. Carrie Wilkens, a psychologist who helped found the CMC 10 years ago. \u201cScience tells us those formulas don\u2019t work very well.\u201d\n\nWhen parents issue edicts, demanding an immediate end to all substance use, it often lodges the family in a harmful cycle, said Dr. Nicole Kosanke, a psychologist at the CMC. Tough love, she said, often backfires by further damaging connections to people to whom the child is closest.\n\nThe center\u2019s approach includes motivational interviewing, a goal-oriented form of counseling; cognitive behavioral therapy, a short-term form of psychotherapy; and harm reduction, which seeks to limit the negative consequences of substance abuse. The psychologists also support the use of anti-craving medications like naltrexone, which block the high of using the substance.\n\nA 2002 study in the journal Addiction showed that motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral therapy and naltrexone, often used together, are far more effective in stopping or reducing drug and alcohol use than the faith-and-abstinence-based model of AA and other 12-step programs. Results of an updated study are not yet out.\n\nJack and Wendy\u2019s son is in his early 20s. Friends suggested that if he did not attend AA, the only thing Jack and Wendy could do was attend Al-Anon.\n\n\u201cThe implication was that there was no other solution,\u201d Jack said.\n\nOn a warm evening last month, about a dozen parents gathered to hear Kosanke describe the center\u2019s program for families, which goes by the acronym CRAFT, for Community Reinforcement and Family Training. It rejects, she said, the use of three words: \u201caddict,\u201d \u201calcoholic\u201d and \u201cenabling,\u201d terms that help perpetuate unhealthy behaviors.\n\nShe prefers the terms favored by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, which says that patients suffer from \u201calcohol use disorder\u201d or \u201csubstance abuse disorder,\u201d terms that convey a spectrum of severity.\n\n\u201cThere are real downsides to labeling a child with a lifetime identity, when that truly may or may not turn out to be the case,\u201d Kosanke said.\n\nCMC doctors say teenagers and young adults are neurologically, psychologically, socially and legally different from adults, and have different treatment needs.\n\nIn fact, a majority of college binge drinkers do not go on to become alcohol dependent, said Dr. Stanton Peele, a Brooklyn psychologist who is a critic of the AA model.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it more encouraging to know that most people are going to outgrow these habits than to think they\u2019re going to have a disease for the rest their lives?\u201d Peele asked. \u201cThe data show that the odds are in your favor.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/07/hfwell15.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8ab7\"", "article_summary": "The center is part of a growing wing of addiction treatment that rejects the AA model of strict abstinence as the sole form of recovery for alcohol and drug users.\nFriends suggested that if he did not attend AA, the only thing Jack and Wendy could do was attend Al-Anon.\nIn fact, a majority of college binge drinkers do not go on to become alcohol dependent, said Dr. Stanton Peele, a Brooklyn psychologist who is a critic of the AA model.\nIt rejects, she said, the use of three words: \u201caddict,\u201d \u201calcoholic\u201d and \u201cenabling,\u201d terms that help perpetuate unhealthy behaviors.\nHe had a disease, and to stay alive, he\u2019d have to attend AA meetings and abstain from alcohol for the rest of his life, they said."}
