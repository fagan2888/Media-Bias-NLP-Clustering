A movie producer and conservative activist says the IRS is auditing him for the first time and suspects the move is in “retaliation” for his documentary criticizing ObamaCare.

“This could be a coincidence,” says Logan Clements, whose film is titled “Sick and Sicker: ObamaCare Canadian Style.” “But there seems to be a pattern here.”

Clements, in a four-minute-long YouTube video, lists several recent incidents in which the Obama administration was accused of targeting others in the media including Breitbart News, which alleged last month that it also was being audited.

The IRS wouldn't discuss the claims, citing privacy laws, but stressed that "audits are based on the information related to tax returns and the underlying tax law -- nothing else."

Clements speculates that his audit -- with its request for a “ridiculously long list of documents” -- is an attempt to delay the release of his movie until after the midterm elections.

As reported first by The Washington Times, Clements also argues in the video that the administration’s actions aren't limited to conservative-leaning journalists and news-gathering agencies.

He cites the Justice Department in 2012 secretly obtaining two months of phone records for Associated Press reporters and editors in what the wire service’s top executive called a "massive and unprecedented intrusion" into how news organizations gather the news.

Clements suggests in a preview of his movie, which appears to have been originally released in 2010, that ObamaCare would result in the type of socialized medicine in Canada that he claims led to the death of his uncle.

Clements appears to be using the incident in part to promote his movie, directing those who watch the video to the website BlastObamaCare.com, where one can download a copy for $10. He also vows to hire a company to blowup an ObamaCare sign on Nov. 5 if he reaches his distribution goal.
