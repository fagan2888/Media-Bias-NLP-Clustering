Studies have backed up the advantages of using the devices, but with technology and data storage come privacy concerns.\n\nColumbus and Cleveland police already use body cameras in Mississippi.\n\nMississippi Rep. Chuck Espy, D-Clarksdale, has proposed a bill for next year\u2019s session that would have state taxpayers buying cameras for patrol officers.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Mississippi supports the use of body cameras for police, but it acknowledges issues to address.\n\n\u201cBody cams can be a win-win,\u201d said Rebecca Curry, director of policy and advocacy at the Mississippi ACLU. \u201cFor police who have accusations filed against them, they can have a transcript of what actually happened. And if something went on with police misconduct, the public has a right to know, and [cameras] would assure accountability and transparency.\u201d\n\nCurry said procedures would need to be put into place to safeguard people\u2019s privacy rights and give officers guidance about when to use the cameras and when to turn them off.\n\n\u201cI know the public might not be incredibly comfortable with you always being on film in any encounter with the police,\u201d Curry said. \u201cBut there are some things we can do to put up some safeguards to protect the privacy of citizens, make sure the data is not retained too long and delineate guidelines for when a camera should be in use.\u201d\n\nRankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey said he supports the use of the cameras, but address the issues first, he says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good idea and a good concept, but the body cam is the least expensive part of the process,\u201d Bailey said. \u201cWhat do you do with the video when it gets full? You have to download it somewhere.\u201d\n\nRead more at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Even Mississippi's ACLU agrees body cameras could be good for police-community relations.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Even Mississippi's ACLU agrees body cameras could be good for police-community relations.", "title": "Mississippi Looking to Expand Use of Police Body Cameras", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericaseleven799734.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-20T21:34:16+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1xnxX0r"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Even Mississippi's ACLU agrees body cameras could be good for police-community relations.", "creator": "@dailysignal", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/zumaamericaseleven799734.jpg"}, "title": "Mississippi Looking to Expand Use of Police Body Cameras", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Law", "tag": "crime", "published_time": "2014-12-21T03:01:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-20T21:34:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Columbus, Miss., Cleveland, Miss., Mississippi ACLU, police, police cameras, civil liberties, State Rep.
