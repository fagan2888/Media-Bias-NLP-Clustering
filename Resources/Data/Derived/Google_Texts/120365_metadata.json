At its passage in 2010, we were promised a savings of $2,500 per family.\n\nWell, look what happened. The average annual cost of a health insurance premium for family coverage was $13,770 in 2010; in 2014, it was $16,834, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Look no further than the checking and bank fees that eat into our accounts month in and month out.\n\nIn 2009, 76 percent of banks offered a checking account with no minimum balance and no monthly fee. Today, only 38 percent do, according to Bankrate.\n\nMeanwhile, the minimum account balance to qualify for no-fee checking at banks has skyrocketed to $6,118, per the Heritage Foundation.\n\nOh, and it\u2019s a lot harder and more costly for the average American to get a mortgage today.\n\nSo much for government intervention.\n\nFurthermore, there are very few stories about brokers absconding with 401(k) or IRA funds, which was one of the reasons noted for this vague and misleading regulatory rule. And if there are creeps who try to rip people off, everyone is protected by the FDIC and SIPC, the SEC and FINRA regulations, and insurance.\n\nAnd what about Social Security? Its future remains in question for those in their late 50s and under \u2014 and these same DC denizens want to run our private retirement accounts? Come on, IRAs and 401(k)s are the few savings products that actually do work in this country for everyone.\n\nIRAs and 401(k)s are personal retirement accounts, not government pensions.
