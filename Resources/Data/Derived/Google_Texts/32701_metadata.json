PETERSBURG \u2014 Though their cause appeared to hit a brick wall in Tallahassee, the mayors of the area\u2019s three largest cities joined more than a dozen medical and business organizations Wednesday to push a project that would increase health coverage to 1 million uninsured working Floridians.\n\nThe mayors \u2013 Democrats Bob Buckhorn of Tampa and Rick Kriseman of St. Petersburg, and Republican George Cretekos of Clearwater \u2013 said Wednesday the issue transcends politics, and inaction on the part of the state Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott would hurt the state to the tune of $253 million a year in tax penalties and $3 billion a year in unpaid medical bills.\n\nBut at a legislative planning event held simultaneously at the state Capitol, House Speaker Steve Crisafulli, a Republican from Merritt Island, said expansion of the state Medicaid system is a non-issue.\n\nThe mayors are pushing a new program, \u201cA Healthy Florida Works,\u201d that would utilize the $50 billion in federal funds earmarked for Florida to establish a state health insurance marketplace involving private providers offering choices of plans.\n\n\u201cThis issue that we are talking about is important. As mayors, we get it probably better than anybody,\u201d said Buckhorn. \u201cMayors are on the ground, mayors have to look into the eyes of our neighbors and our friends out there, mayors understand what the lack of access to health care means: it is a direct impact on the quality of life of the people that we serve.\u201d\n\nThe advocates are careful to avoid the words \u201cMedicaid expansion,\u201d stressing that the project involved a marketplace of private insurers, but Crisafulli indicated it didn\u2019t matter how any attempt to overhaul of Florida\u2019s health care system was described.\n\nScott and the Republican-controlled Legislature refused to establish a state marketplace under the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, and refused to accept the $50 billion over 10 years to expand the state\u2019s Medicaid program to provide private health insurance to more poor Floridians. The 1.3 million people who have enrolled in the ACA in Florida did so on a national marketplace.\n\nThe health advocates said the total cost for treating the uninsured was almost $3 billion in 2012, and the cost of charity care \u2013 treatment of sick people in public hospitals who don\u2019t pay their bills \u2013 is a hidden tax on businesses that raises health insurance premiums around 8 percent, or $1,200 a year.\n\nThey made their case at an event billed as the \u201cCover the Bay\u201d 2015 Bay Area Mayors Conference at the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg. Joining the mayors were Jason Altmire, a former Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania and now an executive at Florida Blue.\n\nAltmire noted that Indiana, under Republican Gov. Mike Pence, on Tuesday became the 28th state to strike a deal with the Obama administration to expand health care to the poor. He said the nation is seeing \u201cmomentum on the side of moving forward with reform.\u201d\n\nThe solution doesn\u2019t have to be straight Medicaid expansion, he said, but will most likely be partnerships such as \u201cA Healthy Florida Works.\u201d\n\nHe called Pence \u201cvery conservative,\u201d adding, \u201cIf Governor Pence can find a way to make it work for the citizens of Indiana, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t find a way to make it work for the residents of Florida.\u201d\n\nThat sentiment may have been shot down by the conversation occurring in Tallahassee, but if the expansion advocates have one wild card it\u2019s a slew of pro- business support.\n\nJoining the mayors Wednesday in St. Petersburg were representatives from all three cities\u2019 chambers of commerce, the area\u2019s largest hospital groups, the Tampa Bay Partnership and the powerful Tallahassee business group Associated Industries of Florida.\n\n\u201cThis is not a political issue, this is a quality of life issue,\u201d said Buckhorn. \u201cIt\u2019s not Democratic issue, it\u2019s not a Republican issue. It\u2019s time for the bickering and the partisanship to stop. This is a fundamental right that affects the quality of the lives of the people that we represent. It\u2019s time for the debate to end.\u201d\n\njstockfisch@tampatrib.com\n\n(813) 259-7834", "article_metadata": {"taboola-pub-time": "Wed, 28 Jan 2015 19:14:59 -0400", "Description": "ST.
