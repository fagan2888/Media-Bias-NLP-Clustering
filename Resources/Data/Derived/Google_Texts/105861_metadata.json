Bush\n\nFormer Washington lobbyist and long-time Republican political operative Ed Gillespie kicks off his campaign Thursday for U.S. Senate in Virginia. If nominated by his party, he would face incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, who defeated fellow former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore (R) by a 65 to 34 landslide in 2008.\n\nA ThinkProgress review of Gillespie\u2019s long career as a registered lobbyist, House Republican leadership aide, Republican National Committee, Republican State Leadership Committee, and Republican Party of Virginia Chairman, America Crossroads co-founder, and George W. Bush adviser reveals that he has taken a number of controversial and contradictory positions and actions:\n\nLobbied for controversial industries\n\nAs a lobbyist in the 1990s with Policy Impact Communications and Barbour Griffith & Rogers, Gillespie represented the tobacco industry in its fight for a settlement that would give companies immunity from civil liability. After he co-founded Quinn Gillespie in 2000, his firm received $700,000 to lobby on behalf of Enron on issues including the California energy crisis it helped cause. Gillespie\u2019s access in the Bush administration helped the company push for favorable energy policies and tax breaks, before the company\u2019s epic collapse. He has also lobbied for the American Petroleum Industry in support of a 2005 pro-industry energy bill, the American Financial Services Association in support of the 1999 Bankruptcy Reform Act which some say helped spur the 2009 economic meltdown, and the Artisan Farmers Association \u2014 the trade association for the foie gras industry \u2014 opposing \u201canimal welfare\u201d regulations that would restrict force-feeding of ducks and geese.\n\nSupported an individual health care mandate \u2014 then opposed it\n\nIn May of 2007, a group of corporate executives formed a Coalition to Advance Healthcare Reform. The group quickly hired Gillespie and his firm to lobby on their agenda, which included \u201censuring every American has affordable healthcare\u201d by providing \u201cassistance for low-income individuals\u201d but mandating that everyone \u201cbe required to carry health insurance.\u201d When, after becoming a Mitt Romney campaign adviser in 2012, Gillespie was asked about the contradiction between his and Romney\u2019s opposition to the Affordable Care Act and his earlier work for a group backing an individual mandate, Gillespie claimed that he had \u201cnot advocated for a federal individual mandate.\u201d Gillespie stopped lobbying for the coalition \u2014 and everyone else \u2014 when he joined the Bush White House that June. But he has embraced the notion of Medicaid and other types of government subsudies and endorsed the concept of a healthcare exchange. Still, Gillespie has embraced a full repeal of Obamacare, claiming that \u201cthe enactment of the Obama healthcare bill with its punitive mandates\u201d would have a \u201cjob-killing impact.\u201d\n\nEnthusiastically backed the Iraq War based on false premises\n\nIn July 2003, Gillespie made the case for George W. Bush\u2019s decision to launch a war in Iraq at his party\u2019s summer meeting:\n\nGILLESPIE: British Intelligence stands by their assessment that the Iraqis sought to purchase uranium from Niger. That\u2019s a fact today, and it was a fact when the President said it 7 months ago. The Democrats are increasingly coalescing behind this position: When presented with universally agreed upon evidence that a brutal dictator with a history of using WMD against his own people and an avowed hatred of the United States is developing a program of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, our policy is to simply hope for the best. That is a na\u00efve proposition. We can fight the war against terror in Baghdad and Kabul, or Boston and Kansas City. If we don\u2019t deal with terrorism, we will deal with its aftermath. The President is right. They are wrong. And this is a debate they cannot win!\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity documented the 935 false statements made by the Bush administration in the lead-up the Iraq War. The report noted that the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Intelligence and Research had earlier deemed the claim about Niger and yellow cake uranium \u201chighly dubious\u201d and that in 2006 Senate Select Committee on Intelligence concluded postwar findings did not support the claim. And no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, despite the administration\u2019s assurances and dogged efforts to find them. Even in 2006, Gillespie continued to defend the war, arguing that establishing a \u201cfree and stable Iraq\u201d over \u201cthose vast oil resources\u201d was \u201cgood for the American people.\u201d And, of course, the lengthy wars did nothing to prevent the tragic bombing in Boston in April.\n\nAdvocated for Bush\u2019s Social Security privatization scheme\n\nIn 2005, President George W. Bush proposed a plan to privatize the Social Security system, eliminating its guarantee of security to millions of American seniors and replacing it with a series of private investment accounts. With opposition from senior groups and Congressional Democrats, as well as disagreements with Congressional Republicans on approach, the proposal did not become law. Despite its failure, Bush cited the effort as the biggest domestic policy achievement of his presidency. Between 2007 and 2009, the stock market lost more than half of its value \u2014 a stark reminder of the risks of this approach. But this past April, Gillespie wrote that had the privatization scheme passed, \u201cit\u2019s fair to argue that our country and the Republican party would be in much better shape today.\u201d\n\nCriticized unregulated outside political groups \u2014 then co-founded Crossroads GPS\n\nIn 2004, Gillespie blasted outside spending groups operating in opposition to Bush\u2019s re-election: \u201cThat\u2019s money that\u2019s not going to be reported to the Federal Election Commission, it\u2019s not going to be transparent,\u201d like the RNC and Bush campaign\u2019s, \u201cand I think it\u2019s a campaign finance scandal in the making.\u201d In a 2007 interview, while noting that he did not believe there was too much money in politics, complained that outside groups are not transparent or sufficiently restricted. \u201cWe have allowed these 527s [political committees] to run wild, unfettered, unregulated, not subject to the same rules and regulations as the national parties. And I think that\u2019s been incredibly unhealthy,\u201d adding that they \u201cshould be subject to the same rules, at least, as the political parties are, if not the individual campaigns themselves.\u201d\n\nThough he once wrote that \u201ctransparency is critical to the process of campaign financing and lobbying activities,\u201d in 2010, Gillespie joined with Karl Rove to co-found American Crossroads (a 527 \u201csuper PAC\u201d) and Crossroads GPS (an even-less-transparent \u201csocial welfare\u201d group which refuses to disclosure its donors). He called the groups \u201cthe gold standard\u201d and helped raise millions for their attack ad campaigns. The groups combined to spend more than $176 million in support of 2012 Republican candidates \u2014 the most of any outside group. Gillespie took a leave of absence from Crossroads during the campaign to work on the Romney campaign, while his old group mounted a nine-figure attack on President Obama.\n\nEmbraced anti-LGBT and abstinence-only policies\n\nAs RNC chairman, Gillespie was a full-throated supporter of a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. He criticized Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) for not voting for the unconstitutional Defense of Marriage Act and told African American pastors that the Republican Party believes marriage \u201cis the legal union of one man and one woman,\u201d so the nation \u201cmust pursue whatever policy is necessary to protect this institution, including a Federal Marriage Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d He endorsed using marriage as a campaign issue in 2012 and observed in 2013, \u201cI don\u2019t think you would ever see the Republican Party platform say we\u2019re in favor of same sex marriage.\u201d Still, Gillespie has said that it is unfair to call the GOP anti-LGBT because while most Republicans support marriage inequality, many \u201care also for the benefits of marriage in the legal system that are afforded protections like, for example, hospital visitation rights or survivorship benefits.\u201d\n\nDuring the Bush years, he supported the White House\u2019s failed abstinence-only approach to sexual education. Complaining that \u201cgovernment spends $12 on safe sex and contraceptives for every $1 spent on abstinence,\u201d he said that Bush was \u201cworking to see that they not only reauthorize abstinence programs, but that more funding be made available for these very necessary programs.\u201d\n\nGillespie has embraced some of the most extremist fringe elements of the Republican Party, calling the Tea Party \u201ca huge asset to Republicans,\u201d praising former Gov. Sarah Palin as someone with \u201ca lot of common sense,\u201d donating to Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli II\u2019s unsuccessful 2013 gubernatorial campaign and to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz 2012 Senate candidacy, and backing Pastor E.W. Jackson Sr.\u2019s unsuccessful campaign for Virginia Lt. Governor.\n\nNow, as Gillespie gears up for his first campaign of his own, he has moved quickly to downplay the few moderate positions he\u2019s taken in the past. A video of his wholehearted 2013 endorsement of the bipartisan Senate comprehensive immigration reform bill was scrubbed from his website.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "Former Washington lobbyist and long-time Republican political operative Ed Gillespie announced today he will seek his party's nomination for U.S. Senate in Virginia.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "Former Washington lobbyist and long-time Republican political operative Ed Gillespie announced today he will seek his party's nomination for U.S. Senate in Virginia.", "title": "Meet Ed Gillespie: The Ex-Bush Operative And Former Tobacco Lobbyist Running For Senate", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/01/16/3091681/meet-gillespie/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BushGillespie.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Former Washington lobbyist and long-time Republican political operative Ed Gillespie announced today he will seek his party's nomination for U.S. Senate in Virginia.", "creator": "@jeisrael", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BushGillespie-321x214.jpg", "title": "Meet Ed Gillespie: The Ex-Bush Operative And Former Tobacco Lobbyist Running For Senate", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BushGillespie.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/BushGillespie.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-01-16T09:42:11+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/joshisraelinvestigates"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8db8\"", "article_summary": "Politics Meet Ed Gillespie: The Ex-Bush Operative And Former Tobacco Lobbyist Running For Senate CREDIT: AP Photo/Ron Edmonds Ed Gillespie with President George W.
