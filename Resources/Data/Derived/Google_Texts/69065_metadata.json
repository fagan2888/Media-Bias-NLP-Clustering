Here are some low-points this week.\n\n1. Some politicians make attack ads against political opponents. Florida Gov. Rick Scott makes them against, uh, constituents who dare criticize him.\n\nIn a video that quickly went viral, a woman named Cara Jennings confronted Scott in a Gainesville, Florida Starbucks for signing a bill cutting funding to Planned Parenthood and other providers of women\u2019s healthcare. In response, he dissembled and denied and then lectured her on where she should get healthcare. The part that went viral came next.\n\n\u201cYou cut Medicaid so I couldn\u2019t get Obamacare,\u201d Jennings yelled, entirely accurately. \u201cYou\u2019re an a**shole. You don\u2019t care about working people. You should be ashamed to show your face around here.\u201d\n\nScott protested that he had \u201ccreated a million jobs,\u201d a huge and round number that appears to be based on air. Jennings looked around and asked other customers if any of them had one of these great jobs. No one answered.\n\nJennings again suggested that shame should be his mantle, and Scott left Starbucks latte-less.\n\nBy week\u2019s end, Scott had unleashed the power of his office and political PAC and released an attack video on Jennings, calling her a \u201clatte liberal,\u201d former \u201canarchist\u201d and someone who \u201crefused to pledge allegiance\u201d when she was a Palm Beach County Commissioner. Because obviously, only an anarchist and a traitor would be upset about the fact that poor women are being denied access to healthcare.\n\nThe rest of the attack video bragged about the governor\u2019s job creation and said \u201calmost everybody\u201d has a job, \u201cexcept those who are sitting around coffee shops, demanding public assistance, surfing the Internet, and cursing at customers.\u201d\n\nSo, that was a mature and dignified way of handling it.\n\n2. Bill O\u2019Reilly still has some whitesplaining to do.\n\nBill O\u2019Reilly enjoys inviting Tavis Smiley on his show and telling him he is completely wrong about racial issues, because O\u2019Reilly, as a white man, knows best.\n\nDuring a segment this week, O\u2019Reilly questioned Smiley\u2019s use of the term \u201cracial arsonist\u201d to describe Donald Trump. \u201cWhat comment set you off?\u201d O\u2019Reilly asked Smiley, because apparently O\u2019Reilly has not been awake for the past 10 months.\n\nSmiley replied that he did not think O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show was long enough to begin to cover the topic of Donald Trump\u2019s racist comments.\n\n\u201cJust give me one,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said sounding almost as immature as his milkshake-swilling buddy Donald. (\u201cHe started it!\u201d)\n\n\u201cOh, come on! You\u2019re wasting good television time, Bill,\u201d Smiley guffawed. \u201cHis anti-immigrant stance. His anti-Muslim stance. His maltreating and that of his supporters the maltreating of African Americans in the audiences at these rallies. Don\u2019t ask a silly question. You know better than this.\u201d\n\nBut Bill does not know better. He just doesn\u2019t see xenophobia and drumming up hatred toward whole groups of people based on religion and race as racist. \u201cWhen you use the words \u2018racial arsonist,\u2019 okay, that conjures up to me David Duke and these kinds of people, who their sole reason for being is to run down blacks or Hispanics or Muslims or whatever,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said.\n\nOkay, so under this logic, being a racist is really a full-time job, and Trump is only a part-timer? Like when he is awake?\n\nSmiley tried to interject that it took Trump rather a long time to denounce Duke after the former KKK leader endorsed Trump.\n\n\u201cBut Travis,\u201d Bill interrupted. \u201cYou make mistakes and so do I.\u201d\n\nNot a mistake, Travis insisted. \u201cThat\u2019s not a mistake.\u201d\n\nBut Bill had stopped listening, or never started, and had worked himself up into a froth of full denial, whitesplain mode. \u201cI have known the man for a long time. I have never seen him do anything racial.\u201d\n\nDoes he really not hear how dumb he sounds?\n\n3. Wisconsin Republican accidentally tells the truth about voter suppression laws.\n\nRep. Glenn Grothman, an outstanding Republican from Wisconsin, might have drunk a little too much of his party\u2019s Kool-Aid. So much so that he kind of forgot to lie on air about the true purpose of voter ID, a.k.a. voter suppression laws in that state.\n\nClearly pleased as punch after Ted Cruz\u2019s decisive victory over Donald Trump, an NBC affiliate reporter asked Grothman how on earth Republicans could win a state they have not carried in a presidential election since 1984. (Yep, Reagan.)\n\nGrothman responded that Hillary Clinton would be a historically weak nominee, and then blurted, \u201cNow we have photo ID, and I think photo ID is going to make a little bit of a difference as well.\u201d\n\nWait, dude, you\u2019re not supposed to say that the whole purpose of the voter I.D law is to depress Democratic turnout and win elections, remember?\n\nAs bad as that was, the reporter ( a loose term to be sure) seemed completely unperturbed, and let Grothman get in a few more talking points before cutting away. Something about how Republicans would win by talking about welfare and immigration blah blah blah.\n\nAnd there you have it. Another great moment in democracy and stellar, hard-hitting journalism.\n\n4. Donald Trump had his very own Rick Perry moment, but of course much, much more stupid.\n\nThose whose memory banks of stupid Republican campaign moments in the past haven\u2019t been completely erased by multiple insane Trumpisms this election season might fondly recall Rick Perry\u2019s \u201coops\u201d moment back in 2011: The none-too-swift Texas governor was quite sure there were three federal agencies he wanted to eliminate, but he could not quite come up with the name of the third.\n\nDonald Trump, who once made fun of Perry for donning glasses to appear smart, did him one better this week. The Trumpster had a hard time naming even one federal department he would eliminate when asked the trademark conservative softball question by Sean Hannity in a Town Hall meeting.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Trump bellowed, well before whatever passes for his brain had engaged. \u201cThe Department of Environmental, I mean the DEP is killing us environmentally, killing our businesses.\u201d\n\nWait, wah?\n\nLet it not be said that Trump does not have specific ideas about how he will govern. The Department of Environmental, you have been warned.\n\n5. Glenn Beck celebrates Easter in a very bizarre way.\n\nGlenn Beck often seems to mix his biblical metaphors when speaking about his pal Ted Cruz, a man Beck believes has been chosen by God to lead us out of the darkness.\n\nSpeaking again about God\u2019s chosen one, Ted, Beck compared the Texas senator to Moses. On Easter. He made this comparison when he talked about sending a sympathetic note to the Cruz family about those nasty tabloid rumors of Ted\u2019s alleged infidelity (the least unlikable thing about him).\n\n\u201cThese guys actually believe it like we believe it,\u201d Beck said quasi-incoherently, referring to Heidi and Ted Cruz. \u201cImagine being in a position to where you believe it, you believe the country is at the end, you believe that God is telling you, \u2018Step up to the plate.\u2019 You believe that you, just like Moses, may be slow in speech and not the perfect guy, but you know if you get in there, you can actually do something and you\u2019ve tried to stay loyal. Do you know what that life is like for two years of tearing yourself apart, of please Lord, just tell me, just tell me, just tell me, I\u2019ll do it, just tell me. And the burden of I blew it? Oh my gosh, I don\u2019t want to be them.\u201d\n\nNow, granted, Beck could have gone full tilt and compared Cruz to Jesus, but he went with Moses this time. Presumably, Jesus will come later. Maybe for Passover. Or is that Elijah?
