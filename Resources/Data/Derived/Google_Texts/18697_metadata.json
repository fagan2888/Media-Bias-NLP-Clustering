Now, it may actually be too easy to enroll.\n\nThat\u2019s according to a new government audit, presented in testimony from the Government Accountability Office, delivered at a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday. When federal auditors tried to apply for insurance coverage and tax credit subsidies using fictitious applicants, they succeeded 11 out of 12 times. Here are some highlights from the GAO\u2019s undercover investigation:\n\nFake applicants got through on the phone\n\nThe auditors couldn\u2019t get coverage for fake applicants just by going online, because the website couldn\u2019t verify their identities. But investigators successfully completed the fake applications on the phone and got coverage for almost all of them. In the one enrollment that didn\u2019t succeed, the applicant declined to give a Social Security Number, though other cases that had missing or invalid SSNs were approved.\n\nCommunication with applicants is still mixed up\n\nThe marketplace asked eight of the fake applicants for additional documents to prove citizenship and identity, \u201cbut an accompanying list of suitable documents that could be sent in response consisted of items for proving income.\u201d This arguably says more about healthcare.gov\u2019s consumer experience than it does about its fraud controls.\n\nAll 11 applicants kept coverage despite missing documents\n\nThe auditors submitted either fake, partial, or no documentation in response to requests. All were automatically renewed in subsidized coverage for 2015.\n\nSix fake applicants got kicked off in 2015, but five got back on\n\nAuditors got the health plans reinstated by calling up the marketplace again. They even got larger subsidies, without asking for a change.\n\nEnrolling in person was difficult\n\nThe GAO also tried to send six investigators to third-party groups known as \u201cnavigators\u201d contracted by the government to help people sign up for coverage in person. They wanted to see whether the navigators would help applicants fudge income levels to qualify for subsidies. But in five of the six cases, they couldn\u2019t get assistance at all.\n\nIt\u2019s a scam with little incentive\n\nOverall, the testimony reveals a messy system that failed to catch deliberate defrauding attempts. The GAO says its results can\u2019t be generalized to the wider population of applicants. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which runs healthcare.gov, has terminated enrollments for more than 200,000 people because of questions over their identities.\n\nMeaghan Smith, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, points out that the website successfully blocked investigators\u2019 first attempts to enroll. In an e-mail, she said the agency has improved \u201cour processes and communications for those with a data matching issue as we work to bolster the integrity of the process.\u201d\n\nThe GAO\u2019s investigation is sure to become a Republican talking point. But it\u2019s not as big a deal as critics of the Affordable Care Act will make it out to be. The GAO didn\u2019t actually uncover any evidence of fraud, and there\u2019s not much incentive for scammers to do what the investigators did. The subsidies don\u2019t come in the form of a cash payment\u2014they\u2019re a discount to a premium\u2014making it tough for crooks to engineer schemes to get money out of Obamacare on a vast scale, as they have with tax refunds or Medicare.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "John Tozzi", "twitter": {"description": "Federal auditors duped\u00a0healthcare.gov\u00a011 out of 12 times", "title": "This Is How Easy It Is to Scam Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-16/this-is-how-easy-it-is-to-scam-obamacare", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iqYenD1aLtEA/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "John Tozzi", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "health care,Obamacare", "news_keywords": "health care,Obamacare", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-16/this-is-how-easy-it-is-to-scam-obamacare", "parsely-title": "This Is How Easy It Is to Scam Obamacare", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-07-16T17:16:11.585Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Federal auditors duped\u00a0healthcare.gov\u00a011 out of 12 times", "parsely-tags": "health care,Obamacare,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2015-07-16T17:16:11.585Z", "parsely-section": "world", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Federal auditors duped\u00a0healthcare.gov\u00a011 out of 12 times", "title": "This Is How Easy It Is to Scam Obamacare", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-16/this-is-how-easy-it-is-to-scam-obamacare", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iqYenD1aLtEA/v2/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Federal auditors duped\u00a0healthcare.gov\u00a011 out of 12 times"}, "parsely-post-id": "NRLBYZ6S972F01", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iqYenD1aLtEA/v2/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca6ac\"", "article_summary": "Six fake applicants got kicked off in 2015, but five got back onAuditors got the health plans reinstated by calling up the marketplace again.\nWhen federal auditors tried to apply for insurance coverage and tax credit subsidies using fictitious applicants, they succeeded 11 out of 12 times.\nIt\u2019s a scam with little incentiveOverall, the testimony reveals a messy system that failed to catch deliberate defrauding attempts.\nAll 11 applicants kept coverage despite missing documentsThe auditors submitted either fake, partial, or no documentation in response to requests.\nHere are some highlights from the GAO\u2019s undercover investigation:Fake applicants got through on the phoneThe auditors couldn\u2019t get coverage for fake applicants just by going online, because the website couldn\u2019t verify their identities."}
