Two other facilities, in the Outer Mission and Union Square, vend anti-abortion messages in the guise of providing family planning assistance.\n\nVariously called \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers\u201d (CPCs), \u201cpregnancy counselling centers,\u201d \u201climited service pregnancy centers\u201d (LSPCs) and \u201cpro-choice counselling clinics,\u201d anti-abortion facilities market themselves as offering options to pregnant women, including abortions. In reality, however, they\u2019re typically faith-based, anti-abortion and only provide narrowly-defined counselling, \u201cemotional support,\u201d and \u201ccommunity resources\u201d to women seeking their help.\n\nCPCs try to persuade women who are considering an abortion to carry the fetus to term. According to NARAL Pro Choice California and other pro-choice organizations, CPCs\u2019 apply emotional abuse, harsh judgement, and lies about abortion\u2019s side-effects to pressure women into changing their minds. One NARAL investigator, posing as a pregnant woman in need of help, was told to \u201cstop whoring around.\u201d Other women have been stalled through the use of \u201crequired\u201d check-ins to make them wait long enough that an abortion was no longer possible.\n\nThe San Francisco Pregnancy Information Disclosure and Protection Ordinance, passed in 2011, forbids clinics from presenting false or misleading advertising or to imply that they offer services that they don\u2019t. The order requires facilities to explicitly state whether or not they provide abortion services or referrals. CPCs claim that such ordinances violate the First Amendment, a freedom of speech argument that caused similar rules in Baltimore and New York to be repealed.\n\nFirst Resort Pregnancy Center, a Bay Area chain that has rebranded itself as Third Box Pregnancy Clinics, and now Support Circle Clinics, challenged San Francisco\u2019s ordinance in federal court. In response, City Attorney Dennis Herrera argued that First Resort\u2019s advertising is \u201can insidious practice that victimizes women who are, in some instances, already victims. It\u2019s especially problematic because these centers can cause interfere with women\u2019s time-sensitive, constitutionally protected right to reproductive choice.\u201d In 2015, the law was upheld by U.S. District Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong of Oakland.\n\n\u201cThe issues here are about accuracy in advertising and making sure that women aren\u2019t misled,\u201d said Amy Everitt, NARAL Pro Choice California director. \u201cRegardless of where you stand on abortion, most people can agree that women should get accurate information when looking for information about their health-care options.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, California became the first state to require CPCs to post information about free and low-cost public programs for family planning, abortion services and prenatal care. Assembly Bill 775, the Reproductive FACT Act, marks reproductive rights advocates\u2019 first success at state regulation of CPCs. However, NARAL discovered through undercover investigations that not all CPCs are abiding by the law. \u201cWe have really progressive, really fabulous laws,\u201d said Everitt. \u201cBut if they aren\u2019t enforced they don\u2019t mean anything.\u201d\n\nNARAL investigators visited 43 of California\u2019s 228 CPCs, and found that regardless of a service-seeker\u2019s situation \u2013 whether or not she was financially stable, in an abusive relationship, in school, or mentally prepared to go through with the pregnancy, among other factors \u2013 CPCs\u2019 unwavering message was to complete the pregnancy. NARAL observed that CPCs\u2019 staff seemed to all be reading from the same script, conveying consistent falsehoods about abortions that the medical community has rejected. Of the CPCs NARAL visited, 46 percent claimed falsely that abortion and breast cancer are linked; and 35 percent asserted that abortion causes fertility issues. A 2008 American Psychological Association study, as well as a 2013 University of California, San Francisco report, concluded that a woman who is forced to carry a fetus to term will suffer more mental health problems than one who decided to have an abortion.\n\nSupport Circle Clinic maintains an office at 450 Sutter Street, with two others located in Oakland and Redwood City. According to case files from First Resort\u2019s \u2013 Support Circle\u2019s predecessor \u2013 AB 775 challenge, the clinic believes that \u201c\u2026abortion harms the mother and father, their families, and the unborn child.\u201d Its mission, as stated in its articles of incorporation, is to \u201cbuild an abortion-free world.\u201d Conversely, Support Circle indicates on its website, buried in its FAQs, that it doesn\u2019t perform or refer for abortions, and that it\u2019s a Christian organization. Support Circle also asserts that Americans should be \u201cdisturbed\u201d and \u201cappalled\u201d by the \u201chigh incidence of abortion.\u201d\n\nFirst Resort was one of many CPCs that paid for Google ads to ensure that they popped up when \u201cabortion\u201d was searched. NARAL persuaded Google to remove the ads after it found that 79 percent of CPCs that purchased advertisements didn\u2019t provide abortion services. NARAL also found that many CPCs don\u2019t disclose their religious affiliation.\n\nAlpha Pregnancy Center operates at 5070 Mission Street. An Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability report on the facility states that it\u2019s a \u201cpro-life center\u201d offering women \u201calternatives to abortion.\u201d However, Alpha\u2019s website doesn\u2019t identify what services it provides, and doesn\u2019t reveal its religious affiliation.\n\nMore than 200 state restrictions on abortions have been enacted over the past six years in both \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d states. Clinics in conservative states face hostility from state health departments, which delay building permits. They can have difficulty finding contractors, who are oftentimes stigmatized and boycotted. Oklahoma and Kansas prohibit publicly-funded institutions from performing abortions, which prevents the next generation of medical professionals from learning how to do the procedure as aging doctors retire. In response, the number of abortion providers has drastically fallen. The chances of a clinic reopening or newly starting are small. Nationally, only 21 facilities have opened, while 162 have closed, since 2010.\n\nBloomberg News reports that just four percent of abortions are conducted in hospitals. These facilities don\u2019t want to tread in politically charged waters, and local governments and religious institutions running hospitals frequently prohibit offering abortions. Likewise, according to Bloomberg News, at least a dozen abortion clinics closed in California since 2011, most of them in the Bay Area. Given that the state has few legal restrictions on abortions, the high number of closures suggests the financial burdens associated with operating a clinic.\n\nSan Francisco clinics that offer abortion services or referrals, as well as information about options available to women seeking help during a pregnancy, are Planned Parenthood, the University of California\u2019s San Francisco Women\u2019s Options Center, San Francisco General Hospital\u2019s (USFGH) Women\u2019s Options Center, and the Women\u2019s Community Center (WCC), at 1833 Fillmore Street.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has several Bay Area clinics, and is known for its acceptance of whichever path its clients choose. A woman is counseled alone if she comes in with a partner, giving her privacy to convey whatever information she wants to, including disclosing if there\u2019s any pressure to have an abortion.\n\nAccording to a 2015 Christian Science Monitor article, clients found Planned Parenthood staff to be \u201cnonjudgmental,\u201d and helpful. The Planned Parenthood facility on Valencia Street offers abortion services, birth control options, HIV testing and services, LGBT services \u2013 such as hormone therapy \u2013 Morning-After Pill emergency contraception, pregnancy testing and services, and sexually transmitted disease testing, treatment and vaccines. It accepts insurance from Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield of California, Contra Costa Health Plan, Partnership Health Plan of California, as well as Obamacare, but provides services to whomever needs them, whether or not they\u2019re insured, offering a sliding pay scale based on income.\n\nWCC is a nonprofit that operates on a volunteer-based business model. After the Women\u2019s Needs Center of the Haight/Ashbury Free Clinics Inc. closed in 1999, a group of medical professionals and community members collaborated to open WCC a few months later. The center serves any female-identified or female-bodied individual 12 years of age and older who wants health care services, including sexually transmitted illness screening and treatment, birth control, prenatal care, acupuncture, and colposcopy. While it doesn\u2019t perform abortions on site, it provides referrals for abortion services, as well as ultrasounds, alcohol and substance abuse treatment, and mental health services.\n\nThe UCSF Medical Center, which manages the Women\u2019s Options Center, is ranked eighth on the U.S. and World News Report Best Hospitals list for 2015-2016; its gynecology department is rated sixth. Operating from 2356 Sutter Street, the center offers abortions, counseling resources, and referrals to other clinics and providers, including WCC. UCSF trains medical professionals in family planning, while conducting clinical research on abortion and contraception. Out-of-pocket prices for women without insurance is $725 for a first trimester abortion, and about $800 for a second trimester abortion.\n\nThe Women\u2019s Options Center at USFGH accepts Medi-Cal, and offers an out of pocket price of about $400 for a first trimester abortion.\n\nThe abortion pill, or a medical abortion, accounts for 20 percent of abortions nationally. However, according to a Guttmacher Institute study released earlier this year, medical abortions are strictly regulated, with 37 states requiring the clinician performing the procedure to be a certified physician and 17 states mandating that the clinician be physically present during the procedure.", "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.potreroview.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/cropped-form_masthead-270x270.jpg"}, "article_summary": "First Resort Pregnancy Center, a Bay Area chain that has rebranded itself as Third Box Pregnancy Clinics, and now Support Circle Clinics, challenged San Francisco\u2019s ordinance in federal court.\nSan Francisco is home to three clinics, located in Bernal Heights, Potrero Hill and the Haight, that offer abortion services.\nLikewise, according to Bloomberg News, at least a dozen abortion clinics closed in California since 2011, most of them in the Bay Area.\nThe order requires facilities to explicitly state whether or not they provide abortion services or referrals.\nVariously called \u201ccrisis pregnancy centers\u201d (CPCs), \u201cpregnancy counselling centers,\u201d \u201climited service pregnancy centers\u201d (LSPCs) and \u201cpro-choice counselling clinics,\u201d anti-abortion facilities market themselves as offering options to pregnant women, including abortions."}
