The Public should vote for me because, having been intimately involved for the past forty years in the problems facing the American Nation and our People under God, The Creator, I know what needs to get done, I know how to get it done, and I know who to be involved with in the power structures, in the terms of personal connections, to handle the specifics of the different jobs at hand to accomplish.\n\nI am not a politician aiming just to get elected in that sense and meaning of the word. I am offering my valued services to the constituency of the 4th District FL to represent them in the process of National Reconstruction; to address what specific issues which are wrong that there are, and to come up with viable solutions, not to be discussed in generalities.\n\nThe gist of our cause in its totality to architecturally arrange our collective way of life here to establish a Great Society for everyone in our United States of America, in our time, arises from the duty of each of us to do justice to others and to the Earth and to all the life abounding here.\n\nThe old adage of caveat emptor (let the buyer beware) is displaced in modern times by society's need to protect innocent people and the innocent in general from suffering loss as a result of unjustly enriching others. The weakness of the person needing protection may be ignorance, inability to understand, or misplaced trust - whether or not the one benefitting is aware of the wrong.\n\nThis duty each of us owes to all others arises from moral, social, domestic, and personal obligations imposed by equity in our courts. It is from this common law duty of fairness and the need to protect innocent people from the consequence of their own weakness that the cause of action for constructive fraud or unjust enrichment was created by our courts.\n\nWith this in mind let us here proceed with the entirety of the Plan, coined The Ten Point Plan, of what we are to accomplish as agreed to in advance as one proposed idea, to remodel the Social Attitudes of The United States with and by our proposed agendas here-forth described.\n\n1. We are To Restore the Integrity of The Indigenous Sovereignty to The Native American Indians as a first priority In Grateful Acknowledgement to The Native American Indians and In Issue of National Honor and To Be Forevermore Resolved In Permanent Resolution, as Primary Foundation to The Nation of The United States of America that was created to the soil of The Homelands of The Indigenous Native American Indian Nation Tribes, and as They Exist as a Federation, that a Treaty Covenant of Native American Indian Sovereignty and Heritage, is to exist in enduring and mutual respect between The United States Government and The Great North American Indian Tribal Federation on a permanent basis.\n\nAnd to the honoring of The Indigenous North American Indians, who are to be so accorded The Vested Primacy of The Indigenous Sovereign here to the soil and territory of The United States proper, as such Treaty Covenant is set down to be described as: The Great North American Indian Sovereignty Covenant Treaty Agreement; of Permanent Constitutional Record in mandate of Mutual Compact, it is agreed that this Covenant is forever to exist between the two separate and lawfully abiding Nations constituting of The People of The Native American Indian Federation and Their Tribal Nations, and of The People of The United States of America and Its Government, inclusive and intertwined of one another as they stand, in Shared Territorial Arrangement and Influence Defined, as to the stating of Dual Sovereignty Arrangement in agreement unto The Heartlands of The Native American Indians, and unto the established Territory of The American People and their Government The United States, as they are mutually destined in permanently binding arrangement to co-exist intertwined extensively to and among one another in residing.\n\nAnd that of such Treaty Covenant that is also separately to exist in permanently binding agreement between The United States Government and each of the individual States of The Union, with Each of The Indigenous Sovereign Native American Indian Tribal Nations residing on their restricted Reservations currently to such respective State's Jurisdictions.\n\na. And as to specific to inclusion of the Indigenous Sovereign Lands once belonging in their outright state to the various Native American Indian Tribes, that those Sovereign Territories be depicted to all Federal and State Maps of The United States coextensively.\n\n2. Undertake the War On Drugs as a real War of deadly intent upon America and upon American Lives at stake for its sure resolution under conflict. And to understand that these drugs and dangerous chemicals in the unmitigated hands of those who commit the crime of treason to traffic in and to wield them as weapons in terror upon the American Population, are responsible for the mass murder of Americans and to the infliction of deadly harm upon the population and our society in the terms of their generate crime and corruption. This is to be accomplished by two methods.\n\na. Decriminalizing Drug and Substance Abuse for the casual addicted users and render the matter as a Medical Issue to be handled by Quarantined Detoxification Rehabilitation.\n\nb. Rendering the Intervention for the Growing, Producing, Refining, and Smuggling Trafficking of Illegal Drugs and Banned Chemical Substances into the hands of The United States Military operating under Central Command for remedy by Intercession of Martial Law upon the whole of the United States and its Territories of Interest with unlimited Search and Destroy Warrants based to Obviousness of Suspicion and to be Tried by Military Tribunals for Summary Judgment and Immediate Execution.\n\nc. And among other measures against any Organized Crime Occurring and concerning the ongoing state of war in such concern requiring the use of Military Force To Curtail in the interests of the Public Safety in stern warning. It is so stated to be worded, that any and all major type involvement in conspiracy to the category of Opium-Heroin and other Illegal Drugs and Controlled Substances, to any part of their, growing, producing, refining, manufacturing, smuggling transportation, and trafficking, and to any conspiracy involvement in the matter most gravely worded to any foul-play occurring in conjunction with the trafficking in Narcotics and other Illegal Drugs and Controlled Substance Chemicals, or gravely worded with regards to any Drug-Chemical Warfare Sabotage occurring against innocent American Lives as victims, with such Drugs and Controlled Substance Chemicals in peril of deadly harm and detriment to The American Public in subversive design, be such subversive sabotage publicly en masse perpetrated or privately conducted, or to there existing any other aspect of criminality directly occurring that is associated to or in connection to Drugs and Controlled Substances, in nature of criminal war-faring aggression with being perpetrated en masse for racial or ethnically motivated crime, or to foreign national plots so formulated conceived, by the means of Drugs and Controlled Substances to attack The American Nation and Its People, or to any other clandestine motives of such attack, so as to being perpetrated privately or publicly against The People of The United States of America in concept of overthrow of The United States for Criminal Motive or for any other Motive, in the use of Drugs and Controlled Substance Chemicals as weapons to such ends, that it is so hereby rendered and Constitutionally worded, that such offenses are to be remanded to The High Crime of Treason, and subject to Capital Punishment for the offense.\n\nd. Be it so further noted, that a State of Conditional War, until it is abated, is ever to exist with and be waged in intervention to against any Foreign Government of The Earth that is engaged in the conduct of Illegal and Clandestine Drug Trafficking or Controlled Substance Chemicals Operations Smuggling into this Nation, as to, growing, producing, refining, manufacturing, smuggling and trafficking activities, being actively and in sustained measure engaged in, regardless of their existing any direct Foreign Government Involvement with such high crimes or no, to do with the harboring and non-intervention of such criminal activities resulting in the exportation/smuggling and trafficking into The United States of any Drugs or Controlled Substance Chemicals, to exist in grave peril in detriment to The People of The United States and effecting the overall Security of The Nation withal, in jeopardy of the lives at stake of innocent American Citizenry, and for our Nation's children's sake in prevention, and to do with the aspect of premeditated Drug-Chemical Warfare sabotage in design of perpetration to food and beverages and by atmospheric contamination incidentally associated to drug use, handling, or trafficking, or deliberately perpetrated by atmosphere, resulting in the physical maiming incapacitation of any American or in the psychiatric jeopardy of detriment against American Lives in issue. And which Drug-Chemical Warfare is henceforth so classified to be regarded in the same category as Conventional Military Chemical Warfare Weaponry, and to what that such exigency of War Clause Action is deemed necessary to preclude.\n\n3.
