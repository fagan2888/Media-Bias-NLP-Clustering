Jeb Bush urges 'self-restraint' in attacking Obamacare

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush says his fellow Republicans should stop trying to defund Obamacare and instead let implementation of the law prove that it won't work.

"Obamacare, flawed to its core, doesn't work," he said in an interview aired on ABC's "This Week." "So have a little bit of self-restraint. It might actually be a politically, a better approach to see the massive dysfunction. But we don't even hear about that because we've stepped on that message. And I think Republicans need to just take a step back and show a little self-restraint and let this happen a little more organically."

In the past two weeks, the government shutdown — which has largely hurt Republicans more than Democrats, according to public polling — has overshadowed a bumbling start for the health care law.

Bush said Republicans also need to articulate an alternative to the reform law.

"I think the best way to repeal ObamaCare is to have an alternative; we never hear the alternative," Bush said. "We could do this in a much lower cost with improved quality based on our principles, free market principles."
