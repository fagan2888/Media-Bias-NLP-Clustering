The so-called Olympic truce, already fragile, was disintegrating. A Games intended as a symbolic embrace of post-Communist Russia by the global community was starting to sour.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPutin applauded the speech, his face unreadable. According to some unverified reports, Russian troops were already mobilising on the borders of Crimea.\n\nA day earlier, Russia\u2019s deputy prime minister Dmitry Kozak had given a press conference hailing the Games as a big PR win for his country.\n\nThe Games made Russia \u201ca lot closer and more appealing and understandable for the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cToday you can see that Russia can keep its word.\u201d\n\nMere days later, the $50 billion pricetag of the Winter Games is looking like a new world record for wasted spin doctoring.\n\nRussia\u2019s parliament has rubber-stamped the leadership\u2019s determination to keep Crimea a de facto Russian state, by force if necessary.\n\nIt appears to be the Georgia playbook. In 2008 \u2013 another Olympic year \u2013 Russian troops moved in to claim the separatist regions of its supposedly independent neighbour.\n\nUkraine\u2019s protest movement is not ignorant. They know that in Georgia it was the pro-western president, who ordered his armed forces to retake control of South Ossetia, that provided the pretext for Russia to mobilise troops and warplanes to crush the Georgian military.\n\nBut if they do not respond, they could lose Crimea anyway. Many, if not most of the unidentified armed men in Crimea\u2019s commercial airport at Simferopol and the military airfield near Sevastopol are under Russian command, or at least influence.\n\nWhat is not clear is the end game. Russia may not want Ukraine, or even Crimea. It may calculate that the diplomatic damage may not be worth the prize.\n\nAs Chatham House adviser Roderic Lyne says, \u201cUkraine is not a prize \u2026 in its current state (it) is a liability\u201d, not least because of its dire economy.\n\nAnd it is too simplistic to assume that even the pro-Russian Ukrainians want to return to the motherland.\n\n\u201cA reversion to rule by Moscow has no attractions,\u201d Lyne wrote for Chatham House on Friday. \u201cPersonal links with Russia are multifarious, trade with Russia is the norm, Russian investment in Ukraine \u2013 in banking, telecoms, natural resources, heavy industry \u2013 is huge and a peaceful and open border is highly desirable. But, for the overwhelming majority of Ukrainians, including native Russian-speakers, hard-won national sovereignty must not be surrendered.\u201d\n\nBut Russia will not tolerate even the chance of losing its Black Sea Fleet base at Sevastopol. And it keenly desires to prevent Ukraine moving away from Russia\u2019s nascent Customs Union, its economic re-stitching of the old USSR, toward the EU \u2013 which it worries would also be a step closer to NATO.\n\nThe question is how far it will go, how much pressure it is willing and able to apply, how much diplomatic pain it will endure, to achieve these aims.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "World", "application-name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "og": {"site_name": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "description": "One week ago at the closing ceremony for Sochi&amp;#8217;s Winter Olympics, IOC chief Thomas Bach delivered what many saw as a veiled plea to his host, Vladimir Putin seated opposite him in the Fisht stadium by the shores of the Black Sea.", "title": "Crimea move makes Sochi look like $50 billion in wasted PR for Russia", "url": "http://www.smh.com.au/world/crimea-move-makes-sochi-look-like-50-billion-in-wasted-pr-for-russia-20140302-hvfrt.html", "image": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/3/t/k/4/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.hvfrt.png/1393719695877.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@smh", "image": {"src": "http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/3/3/t/k/4/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.hvfrt.png/1393719695877.jpg"}, "description": "One week ago at the closing ceremony for Sochi&#8217;s Winter Olympics, IOC chief Thomas Bach delivered what many saw as a veiled plea to his host, Vladimir Putin seated opposite him in the Fisht stadium by the shores of the Black Sea.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Crimea move makes Sochi look like $50 billion in wasted PR for Russia"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Open The Sydney Morning Herald", "robots": "ACAP allow-present prohibited-modification=annotation", "fb": {"app_id": 193677504039845}, "msapplication-starturl": "http://www.smh.com.au", "msapplication-task": "name=Weather;action-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/weather;icon-uri=http://www.smh.com.au/favicon.ico;", "description": "One week ago at the closing ceremony for Sochi&#8217;s Winter Olympics, IOC chief Thomas Bach delivered what many saw as a veiled plea to his host, ..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe17f1\"", "article_summary": "In 2008 \u2013 another Olympic year \u2013 Russian troops moved in to claim the separatist regions of its supposedly independent neighbour.\nAccording to some unverified reports, Russian troops were already mobilising on the borders of Crimea.\n\u201cToday you can see that Russia can keep its word.\u201dMere days later, the $50 billion pricetag of the Winter Games is looking like a new world record for wasted spin doctoring.\nThe Games made Russia \u201ca lot closer and more appealing and understandable for the rest of the world,\u201d he said.\nA Games intended as a symbolic embrace of post-Communist Russia by the global community was starting to sour."}
