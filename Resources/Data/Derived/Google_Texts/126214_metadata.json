LOUIS \u2014 Eager anticipation will soon turn into reality for Rockies baseball fans.\n\nRight-handed starting pitcher Jon Gray, the top prospect in the Rockies organization, is scheduled to make his major-league debut on Tuesday night against the Seattle Mariners at Coors Field.\n\nA major-league source confirmed the news late Sunday night.\n\nGray, 23, the No. 3 overall pick out of the University of Oklahoma in 2013, has been pitching this season for Triple-A Albuquerque. He is 6-6 with a 4.33 ERA in 21 games (20 starts). He\u2019s struck out 110 vs. only 41 walks.\n\nFans have been waiting for Gray\u2019s debut all season, but the Rockies were waiting until Gray reduced his pitch counts and improved the command of his fastball, slider and changeup.\n\nWATCH: What\u2019s one reason to watch the Rockies play the rest of the season?\n\n\u201cThe stuff is there. It\u2019s major-league stuff, absolutely,\u201d Zach Wilson, the Rockies\u2019 senior director of player development, told The Denver Post in May. \u201cBut it\u2019s the consistency that is the next major step for him. Consistency in command, and consistency in seeing him throw a plus-changeup eight out of 10 times, instead of three out of 10 times.\u201d\n\nIn his last six starts, Gray is 3-1 with a 2.70 ERA, with 38 strikeouts vs. 13 walks. He\u2019s been throwing his fastball \u2014 which was clocked at 100 mph at times in college \u2014 in the mid-90s most of this season.\n\nOutfielder and first baseman Kyle Parker, who played with Gray at Triple-A all of this season before before being promoted to the Rockies on Saturday, said he\u2019s seen a lot of improvement from Gray.\n\n\u201cPlaying with Jon this year, from the beginning of the season until now, he\u2019s really developing into a more mentally tough player,\u201d Parker said. \u201cIf you have seen the guy throw you know that he\u2019s pretty special.\n\n\u201cYou can tell right away that he\u2019s a talented guy, but he\u2019s going about his business every day. You go through some negative things on the mound as a starter, but I think that\u2019s where he\u2019s made a lot of improvements. His last couple of outings have been pretty good.\u201d\n\nIn May, while he was going through some rough growing pains, Gray admitted to some frustration, but said he was staying the course.\n\n\u201d Just want people to see, to know, that I\u2019m not panicking,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a bigger picture here. There is a reason I have to go through some things.\u201d\n\nRockies management is convinced that Gray is the real deal. They don\u2019t fear that he is the next Greg Reynolds, a husky right-hander whom the Rockies selected as the No. 2 overall pick in the 2006 draft. Reynolds became the biggest draft bust in team history, winning only six big-league games.\n\n\u201cThere is not a doubt in my mind that Jon has the confidence, and that he has the stuff, to succeed up here,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cYou have to remember, we are not looking for Jon Gray to be a No. 4 or No. 5 starter.\n\n\u201cSure, he could come up here and just be OK. We\u2019re trying to develop him into the No. 1 starter that he has the potential to be. To do that, it takes some time and some patience.\u201d\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Jon Gray scheduled to make major-league debut for Rockies against Mariners", "title": "Jon Gray scheduled to make major-league debut for Rockies against Mariners", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/02/jon-gray-scheduled-to-make-major-league-debut-for-rockies-against-mariners/", "image": {"width": 653, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150717__jon-gray-rockiesp1.jpg", "height": 419}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150717__jon-gray-rockiesp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-02T22:36:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T06:50:08+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Right-handed starting pitcher Jon Gray, the top prospect in the Rockies organization, is scheduled to make his major-league debut on Tuesday night against the Seattle Mariners at Coors Field.\nIt\u2019s major-league stuff, absolutely,\u201d Zach Wilson, the Rockies\u2019 senior director of player development, told The Denver Post in May.\n\u201cYou have to remember, we are not looking for Jon Gray to be a No.\nFans have been waiting for Gray\u2019s debut all season, but the Rockies were waiting until Gray reduced his pitch counts and improved the command of his fastball, slider and changeup.\nThey don\u2019t fear that he is the next Greg Reynolds, a husky right-hander whom the Rockies selected as the No."}
