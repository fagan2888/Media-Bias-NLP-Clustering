Rick Snyder and President Barack Obama pledged to fix Flint, it seemed both levels of government understood the enormity of the problem.\n\nGiven the national outcry, including recent criminal charges of three government workers, we might assume that everything is being done to fix the problem.\n\nSadly, that's not the case. And time is running out.\n\nA bill that would pump $144 million of much-needed money into Flint is being held up in Lansing. State lawmakers need to act with the same sense of urgency they had in January and make that money available now.\n\nThe people of Flint waited long enough for the state to even admit there was a problem. They shouldn't have to wait any longer.\n\nWhile the city is still working on spending the money that's already been allocated, it's irresponsible to wait on politics-as-usual to approve the funds necessary to make Flint water safe for future generations.\n\nThe money is needed to help people like 48-year-old Flint resident Diane Thornton, who works as a packager at Kogel Meats. Thornton's niece has a 3-year-old boy who recently had to have all his baby teeth pulled out, possibly due to lead in the water.\n\nThonrton said the state and federal government would have been quicker to pull out the checkbook if the town was ravaged by a tornado. Like many Flint residents, she is sick of the slow response.\n\n\"It's not an easy fix, but it's a doable fix,\" Thornton said. \"How long are they going to play this out?\"\n\n\n\nDr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the Flint pediatrician who exposed elevated lead levels in in children, is also frustrated with the lack of action, as is state Sen. Jim Ananich (D-Flint).\n\n\"People of Flint need this money now and there is no reason to wait,\" Ananich has said.\n\nOf the proposed $144 million, roughly $42 million would come from federal funds, with the state kicking in $101 million from the general fund.\n\nThe supplemental appropriations package, which would go on the current fiscal year's books, would help Flint in myriad ways. It's a big problem and needs a lot of big fixes.\n\nAround $34.8 million would be devoted to educational and school aid services, including nutrition programs and the Early On program, which will be integral in assisting infants and toddlers who were exposed to lead.\n\nThe timing on these matters is critical. If lawmakers wait much longer, school will be out for summer, diminishing the government's ability to reach many at-risk children.\n\nLead service pipes desperately need replacing, too. The bill would allocate $25 million for that purpose, as well as the $3.9 million the city needs to remain on water from the Detroit system between July and September.\n\nIf Lansing politics hold the bill up much longer, a whole summer spent digging up lead pipes could be wasted. Replacement possibilities could freeze up when the ground does.\n\nThe remainder of the money will help out with other educational, health and environmental issues, as well as create a $45 million emergency reserve fund for Flint water problems.\n\nSo what's holding up the bill?\n\nAnanich told MLive that Republicans are balking at a Medicaid waiver included in the bill that could make it seem like they're kowtowing to Obamacare.\n\nAnd House Speaker Kevin Cotter would like to wait until June for the supplemental bill to be passed, when budget concerns for the next fiscal year will be finalized.\n\nWe shouldn't wait any longer, however. Lawmakers need to find compromise to expedite the money and keep the fixes in Flint moving forward.\n\nNot quickly and unequivocally passing the bill and getting the money to the people of Flint sends the wrong message to lawmakers in Washington D.C., where a bill that would provide up to $250 million for Flint and other communities with drinking water issues still hasn't been passed.\n\nThe state needs to pony up first to show it's serious about fixing Flint so more help can follow.\n\nState legislators have already approved $67 million in funding toward a total of $232 million officials have cited as the amount needed to get Flint back on its feet, with an additional $28 million approved in January to offer lead testing, treatment and emergency services.\n\nThe people of Flint deserve the rest of what is owed to them from the same state government that failed them.\n\nThis is the opinion of the editorial board of MLive Media Group, the parent company of MLive.com.
