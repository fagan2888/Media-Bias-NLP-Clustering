They just shot.\"\n\nKitur said the police were pursuing the gunmen.\n\nPeter Musyoki, a resident in Mombasa's Likoni area who witnessed the shooting, said two masked men toting a rifle and a pistol haphazardly shot at passersby.\n\n\"I saw two men dressed in black with a red ribbon around their heads,\" he said. \"They walked on foot and were just shooting carelessly at anyone they saw.\"\n\nThe latest attack will further dent Kenya's beleaguered tourist industry after a wave of militant attacks and will deepen public frustrations about poor security.\n\nAbout 50 people were killed when gunmen raided Mpeketoni in Lamu County, a coastal region where about 100 people in total have died since mid-June in a series of ambushes and raids.\n\nSomalia's al Shabaab militants have claimed responsibility for many of the attacks but the government, including President Uhuru Kenyatta, has suggested local politicians were behind the incidents.\n\nCritics say the comments by Kenyatta, an ethnic Kikuyu, were political point-scoring against Raila Odinga, a Luo who lost to Kenyatta in last year's election but has been whipping up crowds with anti-government rallies.\n\nThe leaflets distributed at Likoni, warning Odinga and his community, could further fan an already tense political atmosphere in Kenya.\n\n\"This is a revenge for our brothers who were killed in Mpeketoni and you Luos, you wont stay in peace, and you Raila if you have anything to do, just do, we are not fearing you at all,\" said one of the leaflets seen by Reuters.\n\nMany from Kenyatta's Kikuyu community feel their kinsmen were targeted during the Mpeketoni attack.\n\nPolitical allegiances in Kenya tend to follow ethnic lines and signs of inter-ethnic tensions are closely scrutinized. A disputed poll in 2007 sparked weeks of ethnic bloodletting that left more than 1,200 people dead and crippled the economy.\n\nSeveral Western governments, including the United States and Britain, have issued travel warnings advising their citizens to avoid Mombasa.\n\n(Writing by Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Joseph Akwiri", "Author": "Joseph Akwiri", "DCSext.PageNumber": 1, "twitter": {"description": "Gunmen killed at least four people and injured several others in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa on Sunday, police said.", "creator": "@Reuters", "image": {"src": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}, "title": "Gunmen kill at least four in Kenyan port city, scatter leaflets", "site": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "DCSext.rChannel": "Article - News", "sailthru.tags": "US, KENYA, SECURITY, MOMBASA", "DCSext.ChannelList": "worldNews;newsMaps;Travel;ford;rtsCiti;everything;treasuryMarkets;Continental;Cargill;Shell;Verizon;Amtrak;Amtrak2;yahoo3;echoActivityStream;everythingButHugin;OutloudFeed;trending-hp;samsung;newsproHome;merrilledge;ernstyoung;citianniversary;africa;lyxor;fedex_neg;BNY;citgroup;Intel;BNYForesight;HP_Ad2one_Asia", "keywords": "US,KENYA,SECURITY,MOMBASA,Civil Unrest,Africa,International / National Security,Crime,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Somalia,Kenya,Tourism / Travel,Insurgencies,Emerging Market Countries", "DCSext.ContentType": "Article", "description": "Gunmen killed at least four people and injured several others in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa on Sunday, police said.", "WT.cg_n": "World", "DCSext.rCountry": "BETAUS", "DCSext.ContentChannel": "worldNews", "sailthru.date": "2014-07-20T21:53:30+0000", "sailthru.title": "Gunmen kill at least four in Kenyan port city, scatter leaflets", "DCSext.ContentID_worldNews": "USKBN0FP0TQ20140720", "DCSext.ContentHeadline": "Gunmen+kill+at+least+four+in+Kenyan+port+city%2C+scatter+leaflets", "DCSext.ContentID": "USKBN0FP0TQ20140720", "WT.cg_s": "World", "WT.z_inlinetype": "false", "news_keywords": "US;KENYA;SECURITY;MOMBASA;Civil Unrest;Africa;International / National Security;Crime;Diplomacy / Foreign Policy;Somalia;Kenya;Tourism / Travel;Insurgencies;Emerging Market Countries", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "DCSext.PageTotal": 2, "DCSext.rAuthor": "Joseph Akwiri", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "sailthru.description": "Gunmen killed at least four people and injured several others in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa on Sunday, police said.", "DCSext.DartZone": "us.reuters/world/article", "viewport": "width=1100", "sailthru.contenttype": "Article", "WT.z_navid": "nav-Text-worldNews", "site edition": "Reuters", "og": {"site_name": "Reuters", "description": "Gunmen killed at least four people and injured several others in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa on Sunday, police said.", "title": "Gunmen kill at least four in Kenyan port city, scatter leaflets", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "url": "http://www.reuters.com/article/us-kenya-security-mombasa-idUSKBN0FP0TQ20140720", "article": {"section": "World", "tag": "US,KENYA,SECURITY,MOMBASA,Civil Unrest,Africa,International / National Security,Crime,Diplomacy / Foreign Policy,Somalia,Kenya,Tourism / Travel,Insurgencies,Emerging Market Countries", "published_time": "2014-07-20T21:53:30+0000", "modified_time": "2014-07-20T21:53:30+0000", "author": "Joseph Akwiri"}, "type": "article"}, "REVISION_DATE": "Sun Jul 20 21:53:30 UTC 2014", "DCSext.contentversion": "original"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf216\"", "article_summary": "MOMBASA Kenya Gunmen killed at least four people and injured several others in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa on Sunday, police said.\nThe leaflets distributed at Likoni, warning Odinga and his community, could further fan an already tense political atmosphere in Kenya.\nSeveral Western governments, including the United States and Britain, have issued travel warnings advising their citizens to avoid Mombasa.\n\"Some suspects...shot at people indiscriminately and as a result, four people have been killed and several others injured,\" said Robert Kitur, Mombasa County police commander.\nA disputed poll in 2007 sparked weeks of ethnic bloodletting that left more than 1,200 people dead and crippled the economy."}
