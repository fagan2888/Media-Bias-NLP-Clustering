But if the nests come in the way of industrial development, then the provincial government is ready for the sacrifice.\n\nAn application to remove the trees was filed on December 12, 2012.The permit was issued on January 23, 2014 to Middle Point Harbour Limited Partnership, exempting it from Section 34 of the Wildlife Act. The Act disallows the possessing, taking, or destroying of eagle nests.\n\nThe company received the permission from government to cut down two eagle-nest trees on 13 hectares of industrial property to allow a coal-loading facility function.\n\nMike Stalberg, the province's manager of recreational fisheries and wildlife for the west coast region, has signed the exemption.\n\nThis all does not happen regularly and he is surprised that for the approval, said Wayne Wall, an environmental consultant for the company.\n\nTom Pallan, president of the Pallan Group, said in a letter to the province that two evergreens, a Sitka spruce and grand fir, had to be removed to make way for coal-loading facility. The partnership was between We Wai Kai (Cape Mudge) First Nation and the Pallan Group.\n\nStalberg wrote Pallan on May6, 2013, said that he has the power to issue a permit under exceptional situations where there is compulsory requirement. The eagles may be forced to move inland more distant from hunting areas.\n\nOn April 10, 2014, Margaret Henigman, provincial ecosystems biologist, states in an email: \"We should have asked for mitigation for the loss of habitat. As it stands we don't know the activity status of the nests when they were taken down and nothing to compensate for the loss\".\n\nThe company argued that at the time of removal no eagles were nesting.Compensation is not required because of the dense number of eagles in the area and there are also other trees available for eagles.", "article_metadata": {}, "article_summary": "It is against the law in British Columbia to cut down the nest trees of bald eagles.\nThe company argued that at the time of removal no eagles were nesting.Compensation is not required because of the dense number of eagles in the area and there are also other trees available for eagles.\nBut if the nests come in the way of industrial development, then the provincial government is ready for the sacrifice.\nThe company received the permission from government to cut down two eagle-nest trees on 13 hectares of industrial property to allow a coal-loading facility function.\nMike Stalberg, the province's manager of recreational fisheries and wildlife for the west coast region, has signed the exemption."}
