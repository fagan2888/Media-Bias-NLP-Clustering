The pharmaceutical industry has begun to produce more innovative treatments for serious diseases that can extend life and often have fewer side effects than older treatments. However, such treatments are extremely expensive. High drug prices can translate to patient costs of thousands of dollars a year. Out-of-pocket prescription-drug costs rose 2.7% in 2014, according to CMS. Though many middle class Americans can get their out-of-pocket costs paid by drug companies or drug-company-funded foundations, some patients make too much money to qualify for assistance. Others are unaware the programs exist. Medicare patients, who represent nearly one-third of U.S. retail drug spending, cannot receive direct aid from drug companies. A quarter of U.S. prescription-drug users said it was difficult to afford them, in an August survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Drug companies, aware that costs borne by insured patients can limit sales, have stepped up their spending on programs to defray them, such as copay coupons. About 44% of commercially insured patients' prescriptions for specialty drugs involved copay coupons in 2013. Patients on Medicare are starting to feel some relief from out-of-pocket expenses through a provision in the Affordable Care Act that requires a gradual lowering of patient contributions. When the reduction is complete in 2020, the median out-of-pocket cost for Medicare patients taking oral cancer drugs will be $5,660 a year.
