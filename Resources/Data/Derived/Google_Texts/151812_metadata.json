The 2015 ACSI Finance and Insurance Report, released Tuesday, is based on interviews with about 9,200 customers.\n\nThe report scores six industries in the finance and insurance sector. Those industries and their 2015 customer satisfaction scores \u2014 out of a possible 100 \u2014 are:\n\nCredit unions \u2014 81 (a decrease of 4.7 percent from last year)\n\nProperty and casualty insurance \u2014 79 (unchanged)\n\nLife insurance \u2014 77 (a decrease of 3.8 percent)\n\nBanks \u2014 76 (unchanged)\n\nInternet investment services \u2014 76 (a decrease of 7.3 percent)\n\nHealth insurance \u2014 69 (a decrease of 1.4 percent)\n\nThe only other industries measured by the ACSI that have lower satisfaction scores than health insurance are two industries outside the finance and insurance sector \u2014 Internet service providers and the pay-TV industry.\n\nAn ACSI news release explains:\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has delivered millions of customers to health insurance companies, but \u2026 many of these new customers hold individual policies that provide a minimum of coverage with high deductibles.\n\nCustomers who have group health insurance coverage are less satisfied (score of 68) compared with individual policyholders (71).\n\nAmong people with group insurance coverage, those without a choice of plans are less satisfied (65) than those who are offered a choice of plans (70).\n\nNews of the health insurance industry\u2019s ranking among the three lowest-scoring industries measured by the ACSI in 2015 follows news that premiums are projected to rise again in 2016.\n\nThe consulting firm of McKinsey & Co. recently estimated that premiums for policies insurers offer under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the federal law also known as Obamacare, would rise \u201csubstantially\u201d next year, the Fiscal Times reports.\n\nThe median rate increase for a silver-level plan, for example, will increase by 11 percent next year, compared with an increase of 7 percent this year.\n\nDo you think the health insurance industry deserves its low customer satisfaction rating?
