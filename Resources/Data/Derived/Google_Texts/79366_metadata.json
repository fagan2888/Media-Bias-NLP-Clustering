Observance varies widely within each residence, but one principle does not: lifting people up.\n\n\u201cThree words in Deuteronomy,\u201d says Cheryl Cook, Avodah\u2019s new executive director, \u2018Tzedek, tzedek tirdof\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Justice, Justice, Shall You Pursue.\u2019 We\u2019re not just encouraged to pursue justice, we\u2019re commanded. Avodah answers that charge.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cbayit\u201d (home) I visited in Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood consists of three communal apartments in a brownstone, 13 young people in all. (There are 12 in the Brooklyn Bayit and they came to this Community Shabbat as well.) I could smell the cooking in the elevator.\n\nThe minute I walked in, I felt middle-aged and square. Everyone was in their 20s and more casually dressed. The kids (can new graduates still be called kids?) chatted on sofas, on scattered chairs, on the floor.\n\nThere was a groaning bookcase, a batik wall hanging, and a string of small light bulbs lending the room a twinkle. The sign posted near the fridge announced, \u201cThis is a Kosher Kitchen.\u201d\n\nI met Kevin who is working at the Crown Heights Community Mediation Center, Shoshana who is working at the Bronx Jewish Community Council, Kayla who is at the Red Hook Community Justice Center, Hannah who works at Sanctuary for Families. (I promised I would use only first names.)\n\nEli was in charge of tonight\u2019s ritual and meal (everyone takes turns). A paralegal at NYLAG, the New York Legal Assistance Group, he wore a ponytail, square yarmulke and rubber clogs.\n\nHe started by asking each person to bring a family member into the room.\n\nBoth Lynnie and Elana \u201cbrought\u201d their grandmas, whose first yartzheits fell during this particular week. I \u201cbrought\u201d my 15-year-old daughter, who dragged me to my synagogue\u2019s soup kitchen six years ago, where we\u2019ve been serving breakfast Thursday mornings ever since.\n\nEli then distributed a handout on conflict management, entitled \u201cDeep Dialogue: Saying What We Mean and Doing What We Say\u201d by Professor Jay Rothman of Bar Ilan University in Israel.\n\nThe essay suggests that \u201cthe art of peacemaking\u201d is not to argue our own points but to hear someone else\u2019s \u2014 to ask, \u201cWhy do you care so much? Why does this matter to you so deeply?\u201d\n\nEli asked us to pair off to examine Rothman\u2019s essay, then consider committing to truer listening, to being \u201ca pursuer of peace\u201d \u2014 a \u201cRodeph Shalom.\u201d\n\nAs the noise level swelled with competing conversations, it brought back an exchange I had with Rabbi Adam Chalom, a Humanist rabbi in suburban Chicago, who pushed me to expand my definition of Shabbat observance.\n\n\u201cIf we remember that Shabbat was made for the Jewish people by the Jewish people, then it\u2019s not a matter of squeezing ourselves into some box labeled \u2018Shabbat.\u2019 It\u2019s a matter of defining what that box or space can be for us,\u201d he tells me. A Sabbath meal, a Jewish novel, or Jewish study is as authentic as sitting in synagogue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s based on our choices and our lifestyle,\u201d says Chalom. \u201cAnd if you make different choices, the Yiddish phrase is \u2018Gey gezunderheyt\u2019 -- go in good health. Would reading a Jewish poet or going to a Jewish movie on Shabbat count as a Jewish experience? I would say yes. Because it activates your Jewish identity.\u201d\n\nThis reverberates when Eli offers the Avodah group two options before dinner: one to welcome the Sabbath through exercises in mindfulness which he\u2019ll conduct; one through movement \u2014 led by Laurel in her apartment down the hall.\n\nI start in Eli\u2019s group, as he leads us through six brief activities pegged to the order of the prayers. During a loving-kindness meditation, Eli says, \u201cWe\u2019re channeling the feeling we get when we\u2019re hugging a loved one or a small child.\u201d\n\nWe repeat a mantra: \u201cMay I be safe from harm. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease.\u201d\n\nDuring \u201cmindful walking,\u201d we put one step deliberately in front of the other across the small living room. Though this makes me self-conscious, I see its point: we\u2019re slowing things down, noticing how we move \u2014 or rush \u2014 through our days.\n\nEli says, \u201cWe\u2019re working with this metaphor of putting Shabbat in the being mode rather than the doing mode.\u201d (It occurs to me that, though Shabbat is a time for being, it\u2019s nice to be in a roomful of people who, during the week, actually do.)\n\nA few doors down, rap music is playing and Laurel is leading four women on four yoga mats in a series of sweaty exercises.\n\nI can only imagine the Orthodox frowns, but Chalom\u2019s admonition comes back to me. \"The ultimate question is what does Shabbat mean to you. I mean, if you read the text of Shabbat, it\u2019s a creationist holiday. In 6 days, the world was made. Well the vast majority of Jews under the liberal spectrum are not creationist. So there\u2019s an instant disconnect many people have with the language that\u2019s being used. And many of them don\u2019t believe in a personally interventionist God, who either wants or needs all the praise that\u2019s involved....So I think part of the challenge is that disconnect with what Shabbat means at its root. Is it a creationist holiday commemorating the creation of the world and the creator of the world? Or is it a space for Jewish identity?\"\n\nQuestions around identity can strain the bayit at times. Each house has to navigate its pluralism, which is no small feat. \u201cSome people wanted the house to be more observant; some worried it was too observant,\u201d said Lynnie, who hails from Southern California. Others confirmed that there had been disagreements around how to organize a Jewish home that doesn\u2019t alienate the most observant or the least.\n\nCook says the corps members are supported through these tensions, but never dictated. \u201cBeing able to function within a diverse Jewish space is as important as anything they learn. Because it\u2019s the real world,\u201d she explains.\n\nDavid from New Jersey says, \u201cI think the goal is to create \u2014 inside your home \u2014 a microcosm of the world you want to live in outside your home. But it\u2019s hard with 20 strangers.\u201d\n\nThere is one clear area of unanimity: Judaism\u2019s mandate not to stand idly by.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never going to be able to un-link Judaism and social justice again,\u201d says Lynnie.\n\n\u201cJudaism to me isn\u2019t about religious observance,\u201d David says. \u201cIt\u2019s about building community through values.\u201d\n\nChalom\u2019s perspective echoes again: \u201cIf we are all there is, in terms of a conscious force for good in the world, then all the more responsibility is on our shoulders to do something about it. Because it\u2019s not going to happen from anywhere else. If the angels of rescue are not on their way, then we have to be the angels of rescue.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d venture that these corps members are angels of a kind, whatever their complexities and even if they may not agree on what it means to live Jewishly.\n\nReuniting in Eli\u2019s apartment, the group recites the blessings over challah and wine. (The hot challah rolls from Trader Joe\u2019s are a revelation. Who knew?)\n\nEli and Joey have made six courses from two cookbooks \u2014 Syrian and Israeli, including lentil soup, cucumber salad, onion and feta salad, potato and egg and a slow-cooked rice dish.\n\nI try not to eat too voraciously as I don my reporter\u2019s hat, asking these 20-somethings about their Avodah experience. \u201cIt\u2019s a demanding year,\u201d one tells me. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing hard cases, working long days, and then there are two educational programs per week with mandatory attendance.\u201d\n\nI ask Hannah what she likes the most. \u201cThe Community Shabbats like this one.\u201d\n\nAbraham Joshua Heschel said, \u201cA religious person is one who suffers harm done to others, whose greatest passion is compassion, whose greatest strength is love and defiance of despair.\u201d\n\nFor me, Avodah\u2019s members meet Heschel\u2019s definition: they defy despair.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t use the word, \u2018compassion,\u2019 very often,\u201d said Sarah from Rye Brook NY? . \u201cWe talk much more about justice. It\u2019s energizing to be around people who care about the same things.\u201d\n\nAnd enervating, too. \u201cSome people feel they can\u2019t relax because they have to care all the time,\u201d Sarah adds.\n\nJoey chimes in, \u201cSometimes when we get home from these jobs, we need a break from the caring.\u201d\n\nI ask him if he takes away an overriding sense that the world is unjust. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he answers.\n\nIs he optimistic that things will really get better for the populations they\u2019re helping? \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nHis candor actually made me optimistic. Because Joey does the work anyway.\n\nAll 71 current corps members do the work anyway \u2014 despite the scope of poverty and its obstinacy. That seems to me holy labor \u2014 be it Chalom\u2019s definition or any other rabbi\u2019s.\n\nAs I leave Washington Heights, I think about whether, decades ago, I could have been brave enough to choose service between college and career, let alone as a permanent profession.\n\nI wonder how many of these committed young people will ultimately be hooked by this pursuit or drained by it. (Avodah says that in its 17-year-history, 3 out of 4 alumni go on to social justice professions.)\n\nBut mostly I\u2019m aware that this Shabbat dinner reminded me of the Jewish nexus I keep encountering: compassion and elbow grease. You don\u2019t just feel; you act.\n\n\u201cWe are the ones who have to take the raw material of the universe as we find it,\u201d says Rabbi Chalom, \u201cand make it better.\u201d\n\nCool Related
