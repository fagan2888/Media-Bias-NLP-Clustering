It was the 661st homer of his career, moving him past Willie Mays into fourth place on baseball\u2019s all-time list.\n\nThe Yankee Stadium crowd stood and cheered the moment, chanting until Rodriguez emerged from the dugout for a curtain call. If A-Rod had hit that home run in any other ballpark, he would have heard more boos than cheers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time,\u201d Rodriguez said of Yankee Stadium adulation. \u201cI certainly thought the days of curtain calls for me were long gone.\u201d\n\nWhen I heard that Rodriguez had passed Mays, I wasn\u2019t angry. I quit being angry about performance-enhanced players like A-Rod, Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire a long time ago.\n\nRather, I was saddened by the news, and kind of bored.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the great tragedy of the steroid era. It has left baseball fans suspect and jaded.\n\nI suppose that\u2019s a fitting hangover.\n\nSteroid use in baseball produced an amazing high, and we reveled in it. Remember the 1998 season? Remember when the St. Louis Cardinals\u2019 McGwire and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs battled for the National League home run title during a year in which 13 major-leaguers hit at least 40 home runs?\n\nThe excitement the home run race generated was a wonderful buzz. McGwire passed Roger Maris and went on to finish with five home runs in his team\u2019s final series to reach 70 for the season. Sosa finished second in the NL with 66 \u2014 an amazing 26 more than his previous season high. He was named National League MVP. McGwire and Sosa shared the \u201cSportsman of the Year\u201d honor from Sports Illustrated.\n\nThat real-life home run derby grabbed the attention of the nation and helped lift baseball out of the rubble of the 1994 strike.\n\nNow we know it was a sham, and we are left feeling queasy and with a bad taste in our mouths. A-Rod\u2019s milestone home run was just another reminder of baseball\u2019s cheating era.\n\nAnd lost in the mess were the legends passed by in the record books.\n\nHenry Aaron, overthrown by Bonds as baseball\u2019s all-time home run king, was a classy man who quietly moved up the charts as he did his job. He endured racism throughout his career, and vicious hate mail when he passed Babe Ruth. Through it all, Aaron was the personification of dignity, class and grace.\n\nWillie Mays was the \u201cSay Hey Kid\u201d during baseball\u2019s golden age. He rounded the bases like a race car, his ballcap flying off in the wind. He played baseball with a mixture of joy and conviction. His glove, it was said, was the place where triples went to die.\n\nHe was an original.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that Babe Ruth was a better player than Willie Mays,\u201d Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax once said. \u201cRuth is to baseball what Arnold Palmer is to golf. He got the game moving. But I can\u2019t believe he could run as well as Mays, and I can\u2019t believe he was any better an outfielder.\u201d\n\nMays turned 84 on Wednesday and hasn\u2019t played a game since Sept. 9. 1973, when he retired at age 42.\n\nUnlike Bonds, who turned his body into a steroid-induced cartoon character in his chase for personal baseball immortality, Mays was secure in his greatness. He remains so to this day, and he said he wasn\u2019t concerned about being bypassed by A-Rod.\n\n\u201cWhen I started playing ball, around when I was 17, my father said I could be in the top four or five of any category,\u201d Mays recently told the New York Daily News. \u201cLook at the records. I\u2019m still in the top four or five. I never worry about that.\u201d\n\nAfter hitting home run No. 661, A-Rod said: \u201cNobody will ever pass Willie Mays. I\u2019ve talked about him being my father\u2019s favorite player. There\u2019s only one Willie Mays; not only what he did on the field, but what he meant off the field. He\u2019s a legend. He\u2019s also a role model for all of us.\u201d\n\nComing from another player, those words would have matched the moment perfectly. Coming from Rodriguez, they ring hollow.\n\nJust as A-Rod\u2019s 661st home run rings hollow. It was just an afterthought, a moment that made us shake our heads rather than cheer with our hearts.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the real shame of the steroid era.\n\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or twitter.com/psaundersdp\n\nSpotlight on \u2026\n\nMike Trout, center fielder, Angels\n\nWhat\u2019s up: At age 23, Trout is one of the best players in baseball. He hits, slugs, runs down flyballs and steals bases. And he does it all with a flair that reminds you of Willie Mays. He entered Saturday hitting .290 with eight homers, six doubles, 18 RBIs and a .959 OPS. Last week, he homered in consecutive games for the first time this season.\n\nBackground: Trout is maturing as a hitter. He recently told Sports Illustrated baseball guru Tom Verducci that in his entire minor-league career (1,312 plate appearances) he never swung at the first pitch of an at-bat. He was forcing himself to be a more disciplined hitter. But he struck out an American League-high 184 times last year, so he\u2019s changed his approach and has nearly doubled the rate that he swings at first pitches this season, from 11 percent to 21 percent.\n\nSaunders\u2019 take: Whenever the Rockies meet the Dodgers, I\u2019m hoping to see Clayton Kershaw lined up to pitch, simply because he\u2019s one of the best in the game. The same goes for Trout, who has a chance to become one of the greatest players in baseball history. He recently became the youngest player to hit 100 homers and steal 100 bases. If he stays healthy and continues to play well, he could wind up with a career that includes 600 homers, 1,600 RBIs and 300 steals. Unfortunately, Rockies fans rarely get to see him play. He\u2019s played against Colorado only three times, batting 8- for-14 (.571) with a double and two RBIs. The Rockies are at the Angels for a two-game series this week.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Saunders: A-Rod\u2019s milestone gets foggy in steroid era\u2019s hangover", "title": "Saunders: A-Rod\u2019s milestone gets foggy in steroid era\u2019s hangover", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/05/09/saunders-a-rods-milestone-gets-foggy-in-steroid-eras-hangover/", "image": {"width": 512, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg", "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2015-05-09T23:00:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-24T15:37:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It was the 661st homer of his career, moving him past Willie Mays into fourth place on baseball\u2019s all-time list.\nThere\u2019s only one Willie Mays; not only what he did on the field, but what he meant off the field.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe that Babe Ruth was a better player than Willie Mays,\u201d Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax once said.\n\u201cI certainly thought the days of curtain calls for me were long gone.\u201dWhen I heard that Rodriguez had passed Mays, I wasn\u2019t angry.\nAnd he does it all with a flair that reminds you of Willie Mays."}
