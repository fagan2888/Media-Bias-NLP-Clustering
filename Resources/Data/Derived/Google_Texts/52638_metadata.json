(Photo: Dan Radel/Staff Photo)Buy Photo\n\nLONG BRANCH - From the second floor of his apartment in Washington Manor, 70-year old disabled veteran Worden Dixon has a view of the Altantic Ocean.\n\nUntil Monday, he just had no place to sit and admire it because his home lacked furniture. Dixon, who said his service in the U.S. Navy from 1963 to 1967 included a stint in Vietnam, was living in a boarding house in Asbury Park before getting his own apartment through Soldier On, a private nonprofit organization committed to ending homelessness among veterans.\n\n\"This is stellar. I'm still in awe,\" he said after seeing his apartment completely furnished for the first time. \"I will be able to have my daughter over for Thanksgiving.\"\n\nA maintenance worker had informed management at Washington Manor that Dixon was living with no furniture. William Eaton, executive director of Washington Manor, then applied to a program through the New Jersey Affordable Housing Management Association (JAHMA) called In Time of Need.\n\n\"I am ...thrilled that we were able to arrange for Worden Dixon to have the furniture he needed. We are aware of the need for affordable housing among seniors and disabled New Jerseyans and will continue our commitment to assisting our tenants,\" said Eaton.\n\nIn Time of Need provides meaningful assistance to needy residents at JAHMA-affiliated properties.\n\nWashington Manor is subsidized by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for low-income seniors and disabled residents. After completing $3 million in renovations last May, Washington Manor instituted a veteran preference, which gives priority housing to those who served in the military.\n\nThomasville Home Furnishings donated a sofa, a sofa chair, two end tables, a large TV cabinet, a dining room table and two upholstered chairs for the table.\n\nWorden Dixon, center, seen in a photo after recovering an anchor from the Adonis wreck.

It was funded by the state's Housing and Mortgage Financing Agency.\n\nDan Radel: 732-643-4072; dradel@gannettnj.com\n\nDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
