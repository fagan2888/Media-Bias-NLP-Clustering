Chris Christie\u2019s administration threatened to withhold Hurricane Sandy relief funds from Hoboken unless Zimmer supported a politically connected real-estate deal in the city\u2019s north end.\n\nTo prove her case, Zimmer has produced diary entries she said she wrote in May 2013 that include this about Christie: \u201cI thought he was honest. I thought he was moral. I thought he was something very different.\u201d\n\nYesterday it was revealed the city of Hoboken has received a subpoena from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office regarding Mayor Dawn Zimmer\u2019s allegations against top officials in Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s administration.\n\n\u201cThe City of Hoboken has received a subpoena for documents and is fully cooperating,\u201d Zimmer spokesman Juan Melli told the Star-Ledger.\n\nChristie has denied all of Zimmer\u2019s allegations, and Thursday Hoboken spokesman Juan Melli told the Star-Ledger that Zayas\u2019 claims are baseless.\n\nOn her show Wednesday night, Kelly noted that while Zimmer has appeared on CNN and MSNBC, she has not sat down with Fox News.\n\n\u201cThe mayor\u2019s a woman we have tried to speak with repeatedly.\u201d Kelly said.\n\n\u2014 JOURNAL STAFF", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "hoboken", "title": "Hudsonite attorney Louis Zayas appears on Fox News questioning existence of Zimmer diary", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Hudsonite attorney Louis Zayas appears on Fox News questioning existence of Zimmer diary \", \"link\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/02/hudsonite_attorney_louis_zayas.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://imgick.nj.com/home/njo-media/width620/img/jjournal-news/photo/14194451-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"12107728\", \"pub_date\": \"2014-02-01T08:00:32Z\", \"author\": \"The Jersey Journal\", \"tags\": [\"hoboken\"] }", "twitter": {"image": "http://media.nj.com/jjournal-news/photo/14194451-thumb_square_large.jpg", "description": "A Hudson County attorney who just won a big case against Hoboken raised questions about whether Mayor Dawn Zimmer's infamous diary is legit in an interview on Fox News this week.", "card": "summary", "site": "@njdotcom"}, "article_date_updated": "Saturday, February 01, 2014,  3:00 AM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"image_url\": \"http://media.nj.com/jjournal-news/photo/zimmer08jpg-56335a6a80c05c40.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"njojjournal\", \"author_nickname\": \"The Jersey Journal\", \"author_id\": \"1834731\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Jersey Journal Print Edition\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "NJ.com", "description": "A Hudson County attorney who just won a big case against Hoboken raised questions about whether Mayor Dawn Zimmer's infamous diary is legit in an interview on Fox News this week.", "title": "Hudsonite attorney Louis Zayas appears on Fox News questioning existence of Zimmer diary", "url": "http://www.nj.com/jjournal-news/index.ssf/2014/02/hudsonite_attorney_louis_zayas.html", "image": "http://media.nj.com/design/alpha/img/logo_njo.gif", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "NJ.com", "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Saturday, February 01, 2014,  3:00 AM", "article_author": "The Jersey Journal", "Description": "A Hudson County attorney who just won a big case against Hoboken raised questions about whether Mayor Dawn Zimmer's infamous diary is legit in an interview on Fox News this week."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc181\"", "article_summary": "Christie has denied all of Zimmer\u2019s allegations, and Thursday Hoboken spokesman Juan Melli told the Star-Ledger that Zayas\u2019 claims are baseless.\n\u201cThe City of Hoboken has received a subpoena for documents and is fully cooperating,\u201d Zimmer spokesman Juan Melli told the Star-Ledger.\nOn her show Wednesday night, Kelly noted that while Zimmer has appeared on CNN and MSNBC, she has not sat down with Fox News.\nA Hudson County attorney who just won a big case against Hoboken raised questions about whether Mayor Dawn Zimmer\u2019s infamous diary is legit in an interview on Fox News this week.\nChris Christie\u2019s administration threatened to withhold Hurricane Sandy relief funds from Hoboken unless Zimmer supported a politically connected real-estate deal in the city\u2019s north end."}
