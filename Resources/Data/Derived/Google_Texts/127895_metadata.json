Larry Thompson just received a visit by a team of paramedics from REMSA\u2019s community health program.\n\n\u201cI have had four heart attacks and two strokes and the ambulance has been here at least 10 times,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nThe Community Health Program is designed to help patients like Thompson live a healthier life with weekly checkups from paramedics for 30 days after a major surgery. A month ago Thompson had open heart surgery and was recommended to the program by his doctor.\n\n\u201cI was on some diuretic pills that really drained me but it also hurt my kidneys so they complemented that by doing the kidney checks.\u201d\n\nThe program was started 18 months ago with nearly a $10 million grant from the federal government due to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nRyan Ramsdell was a 911 paramedic for 10 years before helping start the Community Health Program and he has noticed a change in the way he looks at patients now.\n\n\u201cI think I look now at ways to better increase people's health knowledge so they can better treat themselves so they are not turning to the emergency room.\u201d\n\nTreating patients at home instead of the emergency room is key to the program.\n\n\u201cSo the people that do actually need to be there, the ones that are having an acute emergency, can be seen sooner,\u201d said Dominic Polimeni, REMSA Community Health Paramedic.\n\nRamsdell got to know Thompson, a retired Marine, over the past 30 days but he is not sad to see him complete the program.\n\n\u201cIt is rewarding knowing that he now fully understands what he needs to do to keep himself healthy and that is more of a reward,\u201d Ramsdell said. \u201cThere is no sadness. \u201c\n\nThe same grant also funds the REMSA Nurse Health Line. The grant money will run out in June 2015. REMSA is hoping doctors' offices and local hospitals will subsidize the program to keep it afloat.\n\n", "article_metadata": {"description": "It is part of a nearly $10 million grant funded by the Affordable Care Act.", "language": "english", "author": "Paul Harris", "og": {"url": "http://www.kolotv.com/home/headlines/Special-REMSA-Unit-Making-Regular-House-Calls-290289291.html", "image": "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/600*600/REMSA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "It is part of a nearly $10 million grant funded by the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Special REMSA Unit Making Regular House Calls"}, "keywords": "Special REMSA Unit Making Regular House Calls", "fb": {"pages": 39225221502}, "msvalidate.01": "9CD4A96D8A076527F07FD24CFCDE5489", "google-site-verification": "0ZhUa7TQ_r1sSB7AzH3l8tpd9Mq-KDKQRH7qc8HMudg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Special REMSA Unit Making Regular"}, "article_summary": "Larry Thompson just received a visit by a team of paramedics from REMSA\u2019s community health program.\n\u201cSo the people that do actually need to be there, the ones that are having an acute emergency, can be seen sooner,\u201d said Dominic Polimeni, REMSA Community Health Paramedic.\nThe Community Health Program is designed to help patients like Thompson live a healthier life with weekly checkups from paramedics for 30 days after a major surgery.\nRENO, NV - If you thought medical professionals did not make house calls anymore, think again.\nRyan Ramsdell was a 911 paramedic for 10 years before helping start the Community Health Program and he has noticed a change in the way he looks at patients now."}
