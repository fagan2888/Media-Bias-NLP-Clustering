For ages, Jim Cramer has said that he is concerned about the market because of the most important group out there\u2014the transports.\n\nFinally on Thursday, the \"Mad Money\" host saw some positive signs that the formerly hideous transports have a little bit of life left.\n\nThere was also breaking news that Dick Costolo, the CEO of Twitter, will resign, effective July 1. Cramer breathed a sigh of relief with this news, as he considers it to be the best, most poorly run company that he knows. He said this not to be mean, but because any company that is talked about this much and has so many investors leaving it because of mismanagement has to be poorly run.\n\n\"It is a hidden diamond that seemed to be on the verge of being seen as a cubic zirconium because of an almost universal acknowledgement by everyone I know that the CEO was in over his head. I used to say the only way this company could get better is to call ABC\u2014anybody but Costolo,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said.\n\n\n\nCramer viewed the resignation and statement that Twitter still anticipates earnings to be in line with previous forecasts, as just another boost of the fact that investors should own the stock. Now is the time to own the stock while the company fixes itself up, or prepares to put itself up for sale. He still thinks there is a chance for improvement at Twitter under a new CEO, or under the umbrella of another company.\n\n\n\nAnd while the Twitter news was red-hot after the bell, it is what happened during the day of trading that really makes the difference. Thus, Cramer focused on the importance of the larger theme of how transports will impact investor portfolios.\n\n\n\n\"I think these good things are happening because FedEx is starting to see business improve overseas. I say that because the U.S. has been on firm footing for some time. It's Europe and Asia that have been real downers,\" Cramer said.\n\nThus, the leg up in the stock shows that there could be a possibility of a worldwide recovery coming.\n\nRead More Cramer: The right time to buy Twitter\n\n", "article_metadata": {"AssetType": "blogpost", "description": "Twitter overhaul? \u201cMad Money\u201d host Jim Cramer shares how the CEO change at Twitter will affect your stock.", "author": "Abigail Stevenson", "og": {"site_name": "CNBC", "description": "Twitter overhaul? \u201cMad Money\u201d host Jim Cramer shares how the CEO change at Twitter will affect your stock.", "title": "Cramer Remix: My take on the Twitter showdown", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/11/cramer-remix-my-take-on-the-twitter-showdown.html", "image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/06/10/102747950-20150609-8236-1395.1910x1000.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Twitter overhaul? \u201cMad Money\u201d host Jim Cramer shares how the CEO change at Twitter will affect your stock.", "title": "Cramer Remix: My take on the Twitter showdown", "url": "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/11/cramer-remix-my-take-on-the-twitter-showdown.html", "image": {"src": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2015/06/10/102747950-20150609-8236-1395.1910x1000.jpg"}, "creator": "@A_StevensonCNBC", "site": "@CNBC", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "GOOGLEBOT": "unavailable_after: 31 Dec 9999 23:59:59 GMT", "keywords": "Mad Money, S&P 500, Jim Cramer, U.S. Business Day, Axovant Sciences Ltd, Arbutus Biopharma Corp, Dick Costolo, Twitter Inc, business news", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2015-06-11T19:29:12-0400", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/CNBC", "section": "Mad Money", "modified_time": "2015-06-11T19:40:35-0400", "tag": "Twitter Inc"}, "pageNodeId": 102753545, "news_keywords": "Jim Cramer, Mad Money, stocks, twitter, axovant, health care, biotech, isis pharma"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe170e\"", "article_summary": "There was also breaking news that Dick Costolo, the CEO of Twitter, will resign, effective July 1.\nHe still thinks there is a chance for improvement at Twitter under a new CEO, or under the umbrella of another company.\nFinally on Thursday, the \"Mad Money\" host saw some positive signs that the formerly hideous transports have a little bit of life left.\nAnd while the Twitter news was red-hot after the bell, it is what happened during the day of trading that really makes the difference.\nRead More Cramer: The right time to buy Twitter"}
