The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced awards and penalties for 2014 this month.\n\n\n\nIn New York City, the worst-performing hospital is the ailing Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn. The 287-bed Bedford-Stuyvesant facility is already on life support, with mediation underway to salvage it from bankruptcy.\n\nInterfaith will forfeit 0.8 percent of its Medicare payments for the current fiscal year, which ends in September 2014. That\u2019s twice as big as the penalty the institution received last year, the first for the incentive program.\n\nThe new penalty will be deducted from Medicare billing payments and will likely amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars for Interfaith, if past Medicare billing is a guide.\n\nThe pain will also be felt acutely in the city\u2019s public hospitals, all but one of which was penalized. Last year, according to the New York City Independent Budget Office, New York City\u2019s Health and Hospitals Corporation\u2019s facilities anticipated $777 million in Medicare revenue for 2013. Collectively, their penalties could cost the city millions of dollars in federal funds.\n\nBrooklyn\u2019s hospitals also fared poorly: 10 out of the 13 institutions there will see reduced Medicare payments.\n\nNew York University Langone Medical Center, in Manhattan, was New York City\u2019s top-performing hospital in this year\u2019s round, and will be rewarded with a 0.5 percent increase in its Medicare funding, potentially worth more than $1.6 million to the hospital.\n\nAs a whole, New York City hospitals are doing better this year than last, when more than three in four local hospitals received penalties from the federal program. Still, the net penalty for city hospitals, 0.15 percent, is significantly higher than the national average of 0.03 percent. Statewide, New York hospitals are being penalized a net 0.17 percent of Medicare funding.\n\nThe quality incentive program follows a carrot-and-stick principle: the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pools 1.25 percent of the value of its annual payments into a $1.1 billion pot, and redistributes it unevenly to hospitals nationwide depending on performance. Hospitals are evaluated on measures that range from clinical procedures to mortality rates and satisfaction among their Medicare patients. Improvement compared to the last evaluation is also rewarded. Winners receive bonus funds, while losers get penalized on their Medicare payments, up to 1.25 percent of a hospital\u2019s Medicare income.\n\nThe new data underscores predictions of early critics of the value-based purchasing program who cautioned that it would disproportionately penalize medical centers that serve poor communities and uniquely unhealthy populations \u2014 so-called \u201csafety net hospitals.\u201d\n\nCitywide, hospitals classified as safety nets by the Commission on the Public\u2019s Health System, a New York City advocacy group, will lose on average more Medicare funding than others: .28 percent compared to .02 percent.\n\nAnthony Feliciano, director of the nonprofit commission, said that for all its positive impact on health services, the quality incentive program was the \u201cwrong policy move.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the one hand it may improve the hospitals\u2019 preventive and primary care because they have to meet those benchmarks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then at the same they\u2019re going to still have a population that tends to be sicker and to get penalized because of the population they serve.\u201d\n\nAt Interfaith Medical Center, spokesperson Melissa Krantz pointed to the institution\u2019s safety-net status as a factor in its penalty for poor performance.\n\n\u201cWe provide care to probably the largest percentages of patients who are government-subsidized by Medicaid and Medicare, certainly in the city, maybe even close to the state,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for the low rating, she said, \u201cI just think you have to put that aside right now because there\u2019s just so much going on for us.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Curtis Skinner", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The New York World", "description": "Second annual review from Medicare leaves all but one Health and Hospitals Corporation facility facing financial penalties from the feds", "title": "New York hospital rankings", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.thenewyorkworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/interfaith2-300x169.jpg", "updated_time": "2013-11-26T22:47:09+00:00", "url": "http://www.thenewyorkworld.com/2013/11/26/hospital-quality/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-New-York-World/242334822480915", "section": "Health", "tag": "hospitals", "published_time": "2013-11-26T16:20:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-26T22:47:09+00:00"}, "fb": {"admins": 668554576}, "twitter": {"domain": "The New York World", "site": "@thenyworld", "card": "summary", "creator": "@thenyworld"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3ea9\"", "article_summary": "In New York City, the worst-performing hospital is the ailing Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn.\nInterfaith will forfeit 0.8 percent of its Medicare payments for the current fiscal year, which ends in September 2014.\nWinners receive bonus funds, while losers get penalized on their Medicare payments, up to 1.25 percent of a hospital\u2019s Medicare income.\nLast year, according to the New York City Independent Budget Office, New York City\u2019s Health and Hospitals Corporation\u2019s facilities anticipated $777 million in Medicare revenue for 2013.\nAs a whole, New York City hospitals are doing better this year than last, when more than three in four local hospitals received penalties from the federal program."}
