Consider New York\u2019s North Shore-LIJ, for example. Its aggressive M&A plan has turned it into the state\u2019s largest employer, encompassing 18 hospitals, plus rehab centers, a medical research center, home-care services and hospice facilities. And last year it began offering health coverage through its own insurance company, CareConnect.\n\nWharton\u2019s health care experts predict the trend of hospital consolidation will continue at a fast clip, particularly as health systems set up more and more Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) in response to the ACA. These organizations tie reimbursement amounts to improvements in quality and reductions in the total cost of care \u2014 in essence forcing providers into accepting risk-based payments. Getting bigger, the thinking goes, could help them weather that change.\n\n\u201cProviders have responded to the call to accept more risk by growing and strengthening themselves in numbers. It\u2019s like a herding instinct,\u201d says Warton health care management professor Lawton R. Burns. \u201cThe public rationale is they\u2019re moving towards population health and assuming the risk of the cost of care of the population they serve. So being bigger allows providers to spread the risk across a much greater population,\u201d Burns adds.\n\n\u201cThe predominant private rationale is that providers consolidate to gobble up more of the market, so they can reduce competition and thereby raise prices.\u201d \u2013Lawton Burns\n\nPrivately, however, hospitals are likely justifying mergers in much the same way as they did during the M&A boom of the 1990s, when the rapid spread of HMOs left hospital administrators desperate to maintain market share. \u201cThe predominant private rationale is that providers consolidate to gobble up more of the market, so they can reduce competition and thereby raise prices,\u201d Burns says. \u201cThe public rationales change over time. But the private rationale stays the same Twitter .\u201d\n\nCreating the Next Kaiser\n\nIn February, the Federal Trade Commission held the latest installment of its ongoing workshop, \u201cExamining Health Care Competition,\u201d where Burns presented new research showing that hospital systems have not succeeded in their mission to provide better coordinated care that results in improved health outcomes and lower costs.\n\nBurns and his co-authors analyzed 15 of the largest integrated health delivery systems in the U.S., scrutinizing publicly available data on financial performance and quality measures. They found that combining hospitals with physician practices has raised hospital prices and per-capita costs of care. Hospitals that integrated with health plans did not improve their clinical or financial efficiency. Furthermore, the more they invested in expanding their health-delivery networks, the more likely they were to suffer lower profit margins and return on capital.\n\n\u201cWe showed that so far, they have higher costs of care and their quality isn\u2019t any better. It\u2019s pretty sobering,\u201d Burns says.\n\nMany integrated health networks are chasing the dream of becoming the next Kaiser Permanente \u2014 the California-based managed care giant that encompasses hospitals and insurance coverage \u2014 but few have ever succeeded. Burns predicts the current class of hospital consolidators will also run into obstacles. \u201cKaiser was set up in the 1930s and 1940s. It began with physicians and added on a health plan, and the hospitals came later. Most of these other places started with hospitals and bolted the other services to them. So they\u2019re starting at a different point, and one that\u2019s more hospital-focused.\u201d\n\nMark Pauly, a Wharton professor of health care management, adds that much of the challenge of making hospital M&A work rests in the hands of doctors \u2014 a tough cohort to crack. \u201cThe main challenge for all of these entities is not to get the hospitals to coordinate with each other, but to get the doctors to coordinate with the hospitals,\u201d Pauly says. \u201cThe failed [M&A deals] in the 1990s occurred because they were unable to get hospitals and doctors to work well together.\u201d\n\nAnd early results from ACOs have been decidedly mixed. In December, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that only 58 of the 330 ACOs that participate in its Shared Savings Program \u2014 which provides financial rewards to organizations that lower their delivery costs while raising quality \u2014 actually managed to hold spending levels far enough below their benchmarks to receive the incentive payments.\n\nWhat\u2019s worrisome about the ACO model, Pauly contends, is that it hinges on hospital management rather than physician management. \u201cKaiser doctors have the Kaiser mindset and culture. A model that\u2019s less dominated by hospital management would seem to be better. ACOs have been able to do some things, but they haven\u2019t really been able to solve this fundamental problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe main challenge for all of these entities is not to get the hospitals to coordinate with each other, but to get the doctors to coordinate with the hospitals\u201d \u2013Mark Pauly\n\nWharton professor of health care management Robert Town believes the jury is still out on the question of whether doctors and hospitals will work better together under the ACA than they did in the past. \u201cIn the 1990s, the big wave of mergers between physicians and hospitals didn\u2019t work out well because hospitals ended up paying way too much for these practices, and once physicians joined them, they stopped working as hard as they did before,\u201d Town says. \u201cThis time around may be a bit different because physicians are more amenable to working in organizations than they used to be.\u201d That\u2019s because working for large health-delivery networks frees physicians from such hassles of having to harass insurance companies for payments. What\u2019s more, Town says, \u201cinformation technology has improved, making it easier for hospitals to measure physician productivity and reward it much more effectively.\u201d\n\nAdding Insurance\n\nTown predicts that, in addition to seeing more M&A between hospitals, physician practices and other health providers, hospitals will continue to launch their own insurance companies. Hospital-owned insurance \u201ccan be appealing in areas where people are price-sensitive, such as the state-based exchanges. There, we\u2019re seeing co-branded, provider-specific [insurance] products,\u201d he says. Hospitals, he adds, \u201ccan cut out the middleman. And when patients sign up for the insurance, the hospitals get them as [customers], giving them a return on investment for managing their care.\u201d\n\nThe biggest threat to the M&A trend, Town says, is antitrust concerns. That\u2019s why the industry has been closely watching a case involving Partners HealthCare in Massachusetts. Late last year, after Partners announced plans to acquire three hospitals, the Health Policy Commission issued a report to the state\u2019s attorney general contending the deals would hamper competition and drive up costs.\n\nMartha Coakley, who was the AG at the time, negotiated a settlement that would have allowed the deal to proceed, but the case went to court and a judge blocked it in January. A few weeks later, Partners moved towards completing a planned acquisition of Harbor Medical Associates, a doctors\u2019 group, drawing fire from the state\u2019s new AG, Maura Healey.\n\nIf Partners prevails, Town predicts, \u201cI could see a lot of hospitals in other states trying to bypass the antitrust laws, just like Partners did.\u201d\n\nHospitals buying bolt-on services like physician practices isn\u2019t necessarily a negative in the new world of health reform, argues John R. Kimberly, professor of management at Wharton. That\u2019s because the ACA rewards hospitals for reducing readmissions and achieving other goals that reflect a healthier patient base. \u201cPart of the larger landscape here is a shift in the values behind the system: Finally there\u2019s a positive movement towards keeping people healthy as opposed to just treating people who are sick,\u201d Kimberly says.\n\n\u201cYou have to think of the components of the Affordable Care Act in the context of this larger shift. How does a system gear up to keep a population healthy? It makes sense to try to create the scale you need in order to meet that objective efficiently and effectively. Three or four hospitals in a local system may make good strategic sense, provided the consolidation isn\u2019t just about hospitals. It needs to include ancillary organizations \u2014 rehab facilities and so on \u2014 that you need to keep a population healthy.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2026 Consumers lose [when hospitals also own health insurance plans] \u2026 because prices rise, and that gets translated into higher premiums\u2026.\u201d \u2013Robert Town\n\nEmbracing Innovation\n\nSuccess will hinge upon hospitals hitting on the proper compensation systems to reward health care workers for keeping people healthy, Kimberly adds. That\u2019s one of the many goals of the innovation centers that have started popping up in hospitals.\n\n\u201cEverybody is in the innovation game. They\u2019re developing ways to get employees involved,\u201d says Kimberly, who is now working on a study of hospital innovation centers. The study is examining the differences between hospital systems in the mission of innovation centers and methods for incentivizing hospital workers. He hopes the study will shed light on the prevailing question about innovation centers: \u201cEvery hospital has to have a chief innovation officer, but ultimately, what difference does it make?\u201d\n\nAs for the quest to be like Kaiser, Town fears that may prove to be an unreachable goal. \u201cKaiser can\u2019t even emulate Kaiser,\u201d Town says. Indeed, the company has expanded to six additional states and the District of Columbia, but hasn\u2019t quite found the same success in those places as it did in California. And in 2013, the company sold off its faltering Ohio division to Catholic Health Partners. \u201cYou need a lot of scale to be both the insurer and the hospital system,\u201d Town says. \u201cTo get there, they\u2019d have to take away a lot of business from existing participants and establish high fixed-cost facilities. It\u2019s hard to get the scale to make it work.\u201d\n\nNot only are merged hospitals struggling to reap efficiency gains, Town says, they\u2019re also failing to pass along any benefits of size to their end customers\u2014the patients. \u201cThe preponderance of the evidence is that consumers lose. They lose because prices rise, and that gets translated into higher premiums.\u201d\n\nM&A also leaves patients with fewer health care choices, because in this uncertain new world created by the ACA, Town says, the barriers to entry for new hospitals to start up are just too high. \u201cThe harm to competition is significant, and it\u2019s hard to undo.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the last hospital merger wave in the 1990s, things did not go so well.
