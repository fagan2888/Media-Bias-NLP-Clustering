An amazing 44 percent of all respondents said they didn\u2019t often feel proud to be American. Only 28 percent said that America was the greatest nation on earth.\n\nNot surprisingly, there\u2019s a strong split on a partisan level, with Democrats more likely to say they are less proud to be an American.\n\nPew divided their sample into different categories across the left-right political spectrum. When asked if respondents \u201coften feel proud to be American,\u201d a majority of strong liberals, 60 percent, said no. The only group that solidly agreed with the statement was conservatives, ranging from 72 percent to 81 percent. About half of the respondents in the middle of the spectrum \u2013 essentially libertarians to socially conservative fiscal liberals \u2013 said they were proud to be American.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just another eye-opening poll, however. What Pew has found is critically important for the direction of this country. As Fox News\u2019 Chris Stirewalt asks: \u201chow do you unite people to save the country if they\u2019re not invested in its success?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not that the 44 percent who aren\u2019t proud are all moving to Costa Rica, it\u2019s that they feel less obliged to do the hard work necessary to make a system this demanding work. Politicians and public figures who intentionally exploit and deepen divisions and resentments are doing more than just creating gridlock, they\u2019re undercutting the very idea that has lit the lamp of America\u2019s greatness for nearly three centuries.\n\nI for one would not be opposed to having the 44 percent who aren\u2019t proud to be American move to Costa Rica, or anywhere else for that matter. Despite the gridlock, scandals, and crises this country is currently facing, we are still the greatest nation on earth, period.", "article_metadata": {"description": "U-S-A?.05/24/2016 23:57:45PM EST.", "author": "Leah Barkoukis", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "U-S-A?", "title": "Leah Barkoukis - Poll: Proud to Be an American?
