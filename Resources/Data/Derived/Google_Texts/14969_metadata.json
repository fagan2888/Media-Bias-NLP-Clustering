Peterson Foundation will announce a $200 million offshoot next month, the Peterson Center on Healthcare. The new organization boasts a boldface-name advisory board -- including Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates -- and big goals. Peterson and his son Michael Peterson, the president of the foundation, are seeking to further slow the increase in U.S. health-care costs while improving care for patients.\n\n\u201cHealth care is one of the single greatest fiscal and economic challenges facing the country,\u201d Michael Peterson said in an interview. \u201cWe spend twice as much as many other advanced nations and have outcomes that are often no better. We have an important opportunity to significantly improve the health and health care provided to our citizens and also improve our economy.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. spent about 17 percent of its gross domestic product on health care in 2012, at least 5 percentage points more than any other developed nation, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine, a nonprofit group that advises the U.S. government, has estimated that about 30 cents of every dollar spent on health care in 2009, or $765 billion, was wasted on unnecessary services, inefficient practices, high prices, excessive administrative costs, fraud and missed opportunities to prevent costly illnesses and conditions. The Petersons\u2019 new center wants to spend its money promoting practices by hospitals, doctors and others that cut that waste.\n\nOvercoming Skepticism\n\nThe new organization will have to overcome the skepticism of Peterson\u2019s liberal critics in Washington, who have said the Peterson Foundation\u2019s focus on debt reduction is misguided and potentially harmful to the beneficiaries of programs such as Medicare and Social Security. One of those critics, Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said he wonders whether the Petersons\u2019 new health center is intended to further its namesake\u2019s political agenda.\n\n\u201cEverything he\u2019s done has a clear bias toward cutting public-sector programs, Social Security and Medicare,\u201d Baker said in a phone interview. \u201cI worry this will carry in that same vein.\u201d\n\nMichael Peterson said the health center has no political agenda and deliberately sought out advisers from across the ideological spectrum. Ezekiel Emanuel, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama who helped design the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, is a member of the center\u2019s advisory board, as is Joseph Antos, a health economist at the American Enterprise Institute, which opposes the law known as Obamacare.\n\nOutcomes, Cost\n\nThe foundation also reached out to Baker to solicit suggestions for the new health center\u2019s advisory board, Baker said. He said he declined to respond.\n\n\u201cOur main focus is to drive greater performance in the system,\u201d Michael Peterson said. \u201cAs we measure performance it is outcomes and cost. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone in the country who should be opposed to having better health care delivered to Americans at more efficient prices.\u201d\n\nTo urge the government to cut the national debt, the Peterson Foundation funds research and holds an annual summit, among other activities.\n\nPeter Peterson, 88, was U.S. commerce secretary under former President Richard Nixon from 1972 to 1973, then led Lehman Brothers until 1984. He co-founded the Blackstone Group a year later. Before creating the Peterson Foundation in 2008, he co-founded the Concord Coalition, a budget watchdog group. He also owns the Fiscal Times, a digital news organization based in New York.\n\nElder Care\n\nMichael Peterson, 45, worked on the campaigns of President Bill Clinton and Michael Dukakis, both Democrats, and for former House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, a Democrat.\n\nThe younger Peterson declined to offer specific examples of projects the health-care center will support ahead of its Dec. 4 announcement. Jeffrey Selberg, the center\u2019s executive director, said that the initial focus will include primary care and patients who require an inordinate amount of health-care services, such as frail elderly people.\n\n\u201cWe will be spending time with those providers who know how to care for these people very effectively so that their quality of life is improved, their clinical condition is as good as can be,\u201d Selberg said in an interview.\n\nEducation and wage stagnation, both issues of interest to liberals, are affected by high U.S. health-care costs, Michael Peterson said. Health-care spending \u201ccrowds out\u201d budget resources that states and local governments could otherwise use for schools, and rising costs to employers for health benefits suppresses raises in take-home pay for workers, he said.\n\n\u201cEveryone should be rowing in the same direction in terms of trying to improve performance,\u201d Peterson said.\n\nUnique Mission\n\nDrew Altman, president and chief executive officer of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a Menlo Park, California, research group, said that he seldom joins the boards of other organizations. He agreed to advise the Peterson Center because he is convinced that its mission is unique, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only organized effort I know of to try to focus on actually gathering the evidence and validating what works and what doesn\u2019t in delivery and payment reform and actually scaling it up across the entire country,\u201d Altman said in an interview.\n\nRon Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a health consumer advocacy group in Washington that is closely allied with the White House, said he sees a separation between the Peterson health center and Peter Peterson\u2019s views on the federal budget and debt.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s the private sector, employer-sponsored insurance, or individual coverage that people buy, this initiative is designed to really make sure that America\u2019s health insurance system is a much better value proposition,\u201d Pollack said in a phone interview. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t come from the perspective of, our top priority is cutting the federal budget.\u201d\n\n(Michael Peterson\u2019s title was incorrect in an earlier version of this story.)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Alex Wayne", "twitter": {"description": "Peter Peterson, the Blackstone Group LP co-founder who has championed the cause of U.S. debt reduction, is now taking aim at some $800 billion in annual waste in the nation\u2019s health-care system.", "title": "Improving Health Care Is Billionaire Peterson\u2019s Next Mission", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-21/improving-health-care-is-billionaire-peterson-s-next-mission", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iRUKB23VUSqc/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@business", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-author": "Alex Wayne", "parsely-type": "post", "keywords": "U.S. Debt,Michael A Peterson,Pete Peterson,Health", "news_keywords": "U.S. Debt,Michael A Peterson,Pete Peterson,Health", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-21/improving-health-care-is-billionaire-peterson-s-next-mission", "parsely-title": "Improving Health Care Is Billionaire Peterson\u2019s Next Mission", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff0000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "no", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-11-21T18:07:25.541Z", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "description": "Peter Peterson, the Blackstone Group LP co-founder who has championed the cause of U.S. debt reduction, is now taking aim at some $800 billion in annual waste in the nation\u2019s health-care system.", "parsely-tags": "U.S. Debt,Michael A Peterson,Pete Peterson,Health,Region: Global,Page: article", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.bwbx.io/business/public/images/favicons/mstile-144x144-bbd2101292.png", "date": "2014-11-21T18:07:25.541Z", "parsely-section": "science-energy", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com", "description": "Peter Peterson, the Blackstone Group LP co-founder who has championed the cause of U.S. debt reduction, is now taking aim at some $800 billion in annual waste in the nation\u2019s health-care system.", "title": "Improving Health Care Is Billionaire Peterson\u2019s Next Mission", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-11-21/improving-health-care-is-billionaire-peterson-s-next-mission", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iRUKB23VUSqc/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "fb": {"status": "Peter Peterson, the Blackstone Group LP co-founder who has championed the cause of U.S. debt reduction, is now taking aim at some $800 billion in annual waste in the nation\u2019s health-care system."}, "parsely-post-id": "NFEALY6JIJV701", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iRUKB23VUSqc/v1/-1x-1.jpg"}, "_id": "\"57477afa6914bd0286fe5573\"", "article_summary": "\u201cHealth care is one of the single greatest fiscal and economic challenges facing the country,\u201d Michael Peterson said in an interview.\nWe have an important opportunity to significantly improve the health and health care provided to our citizens and also improve our economy.\u201dThe U.S. spent about 17 percent of its gross domestic product on health care in 2012, at least 5 percentage points more than any other developed nation, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Paris.\nHe agreed to advise the Peterson Center because he is convinced that its mission is unique, he said.\nThe billionaire\u2019s New York-based Peter G.
