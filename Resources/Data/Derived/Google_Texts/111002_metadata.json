Tom Coburn's misleading report on health care spending, which attacked the Affordable Care Act by cherry-picking data on the rise of spending in health care systems.\n\nThe Oklahoma Republican released a report this week titled \"The History of Federal Health Care Spending,\" which attempted to rebut projections that the ACA will reduce the deficit and lower health care costs by presenting data on the cost growth of other federal programs like Medicaid and Medicare. The report argued that that \"the government's spending on health care programs usually outpaces economic growth\" and that \"compared with initial government estimates and outlays, most programs have experienced exponential growth.\"\n\nOn Fox News' America's Newsroom, co-host Bill Hemmer said the report revealed \"stunning numbers,\" while Fox contributor Charles Gasparino endorsed the report's suggestion that the growth in government health care programs contradicted positive projections of the ACA's impact, claiming \"when government is this much enmeshed in a program like this, it always leads to disaster\":\n\nBut Fox's hype ignores the crucial flaw in Coburn's report -- it omits crucial context about why the programs' costs have increased and how they perform at controlling costs when compared to private health insurance.\n\nWhile it's true that spending on programs such as Medicaid and Medicare have increased over the last 50 years, the cause of those rising costs are not a result of government involvement, but due to the fact that overall spending on health care has increased exponentially. A 2010 report in Health Affairs which tracked Medicare spending over roughly 20 years found that much of the growth \"is attributable to rising spending on chronic conditions -- specifically diabetes and hypertension, both of which rose considerably in treated prevalence over the past two decades.\"\n\nNotably, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that \"Since Medicare's inception, however, growth in annual spending per beneficiary has been approximately one percentage point lower than private health insurance spending\":", "article_metadata": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Media Matters for America", "description": "Fox News is helping promote Sen.
