John Kasich\u2019s poll numbers may not be skyrocketing, but the cost of expanding Medicaid in his state certainly is.\n\nFor Watchdog readers, neither of these things will come as a surprise. When Kasich announced his bid for the presidency last year, Watchdog\u2019s coverage of his major policy decisions as governor of Ohio had already been nearly a year in the making. Since then, Kasich\u2019s presidential campaign has brought his controversial decision to take advantage of President Obama\u2019s unpopular 2010 healthcare law into the spotlight as Republican primary voters decide whether the Ohio governor\u2019s policies align with their values.\n\nKasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion\n\nWatchdog reporter Jason Hart first took up the story in September 2014. Ohio\u2019s Medicaid enrollment under the expansion had just topped 367,000, passing Kasich\u2019s initial projection for enrollment levels at July 2015. In the year and a half since, the governor\u2019s projections for his state have continued to fall far short of the actual tally. Last March was the most expensive month yet for the expanded program, costing taxpayers $411 million as more working-age adults with no kids and no disabilities flocked to the Medicaid rolls. This puts Kasich\u2019s Obamacare expansion on track to cost $28.5 billion by the year 2020 \u2013 more than twice as much as his administration projected.\n\nThis has raised questions from critics who worry that expanding health care for able-bodied adults could be a disincentive to work. How many of the Ohioans who have recently enrolled in Medicaid have jobs?\n\nNo one knows, not even the Ohio Department of Medicaid. Last Spring, the department told state Senate members that 43 percent of enrollees were employed, but it has no current data on how many of Ohio\u2019s 673,000 Obamacare expansion enrollees are gainfully employed. ODM also doesn\u2019t track how many of these new enrollees had private or employer-sponsored health insurance prior to enrolling in Medicaid \u2013 or how many of them are incarcerated.\n\nNever mind that Kasich initially estimated 447,000 people would sign up under the expansion by 2020. That means that \u201cif ODM capped Obamacare expansion enrollment at its current level,\u201d wrote Hart, \u201cthe two-year-old program would already be 48 percent larger than the Kasich administration said it would be after seven years.\u201d\n\nLest anyone be confused about how Medicaid expansion became part of Ohio law in the first place, Hart has a helpful breakdown of how the policy fight played out in 2013:\n\nRead the rest of this article here.\n\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n\nThis article originally appeared at Watchdog.org.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ohio Gov.
