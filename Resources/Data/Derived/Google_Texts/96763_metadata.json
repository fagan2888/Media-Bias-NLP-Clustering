But Seney alleges he arrived to discover an insurance broker led the presentation that \"put 'Obamacare' in a very negative light,\" mere days before the Nov. 6 national vote that would result in the president's reelection.\n\n\"[T]he presenter said that one of the big problems was that it was passed by only one party, the Democrats,\" according to the complaint. \"The last line of the very last slide that was presented to the employee and Seney stated that the outcome of the 2012 election would have a huge impact on whether or not all of the changes (rate increases) would take effect. The message at the meeting was very clear: Vote for Obama and your health care costs will be higher.\"\n\nSeney states he was \"very upset\" when he complained about the meeting to his general manager, Sherry Hosmer, who is not named as a plaintiff in the suit. After Seney informed Hosmer he would not attend any more \"politically motivated\" meetings on his day off, he was fired, according to the complaint.\n\nIt was six days before Obama was reelected.\n\nEmail: mcoker@ocweekly.com.
