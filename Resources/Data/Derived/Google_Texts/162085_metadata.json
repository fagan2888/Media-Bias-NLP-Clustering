Chellie Pingree.\n\nShaw\u2019s drew media attention after the company\u2019s Brunswick store abruptly stopped its long-standing policy of donating perishable food to Mid Coast Hunger Prevention in Brunswick. Several days later, however, company officials said they would allow the resumption of donations to Mid Coast Hunger Prevention, a food pantry and soup kitchen that provided food to 1,200 families in eight midcoast towns and served more than 45,000 hot meals.\n\nOn Saturday, Pingree said that Shaw\u2019s President Jim Rice told her the company would continue to allow donations from its Brunswick and Bangor stores and would revisit the policy elsewhere.\n\n\u201cI really appreciate the company taking another look at this policy,\u201d Pingree, who represents the 1st District, said in a statement. \u201cI know Shaw\u2019s is committed to the communities they operate in and they already do help hunger organizations in a number other ways. But I hope they can also find a way to expand that commitment further by donating perishable food to soup kitchens and food pantries.\u201d\n\nShaw\u2019s had phased out the perishable food donation program, known as Fresh Rescue, although some individual stores had continued the donations.\n\nA spokeswoman for Shaw\u2019s could not be reached Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Maine congresswoman says the head of the supermarket chain told her that donations of perishable goods to soup kitchens and food pantries can continue at its Brunswick and Bangor stores.", "generator": "WordPress 4.3.4", "og": {"site_name": "The Portland Press Herald / Maine Sunday Telegram", "description": "The Maine congresswoman says the head of the supermarket chain told her that donations of perishable goods to soup kitchens and food pantries can continue at its Brunswick and Bangor stores.", "title": "Shaw's to revisit food donations program, Rep.
