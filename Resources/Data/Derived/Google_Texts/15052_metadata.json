Crazed warlords and rampaging psychonauts attack nonstop. Fleets of monster trucks, cranked-up hot rods and armored battle bikes scream through the desert and sail through the air. Bullets rain down, chain saws snarl, flame-throwers belch and spew\u2014and that\u2019s just the basics. Miller has spent the 30 years since his original Mad Max trilogy came to an end making great pictures about dancing penguins, talking pigs, and whatnot. Now, at age 70, he\u2019s back in action, and he\u2019s still the most gifted director in the crash-and-burn game. The movie\u2019s relentless frenzy is astonishing.\n\nYou\u2019ll recall from the earlier films that Max Rockatansky, Miller\u2019s battered road warrior, is a onetime cop who lost his wife and child in the savage tumult of a postapocalyptic civilizational breakdown. The role of Max made Mel Gibson a worldwide star; now, played by Tom Hardy, he\u2019s still a wanderer, still \u201csearching for a righteous cause.\u201d After a typically insane spasm of opening action, he\u2019s captured by the hot-rodding minions of Immortan Joe, a wasteland tyrant who rules from a skull-shaped mountaintop fortress. (He\u2019s played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who also played Toecutter in Miller\u2019s 1979 Mad Max.) Joe subjugates the local populace through his control of water, munitions, and the fuel to power his scrap-heap automotive legion. Dragged back to this dismal kingdom, Max is spotted by Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of Joe\u2019s trusted lieutenants. Furiosa is on her way elsewhere, though. She\u2019s embarked on an act of treachery that sets the plot in motion.\n\nIt\u2019s a slowly dawning surprise to realize that a movie so ferociously devoted to action also has something else on its mind. Furiosa is actually the film\u2019s central character. Kidnapped as a child from some vague paradise called \u201cthe green place,\u201d she was raised in Joe\u2019s harsh realm, where young women are valued only as sex slaves and \u201cbreeders,\u201d relied upon to produce a new generation free of the diseases that infest the rest of this miserable world. The hideous Joe, with his wild white hair, demonic eyes, and horse-toothed jaw mask, keeps five of these fertile women as his personal property, and Furiosa has secretly stowed them away in her 18-wheel war truck for a gas run that is actually an escape back to the green place.\n\nThe picture\u2019s focus on women never devolves into standard feminist talking points (although Miller did bring in Vagina Monologues author Eve Ensler to instruct the cast on the realities of international rape cultures). Joe\u2019s five brides\u2014among them Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, and Riley Keough\u2014stand in for traditional action-flick beauties, although they\u2019re too kickass to be pigeonholed as simple babes. And later we meet a tribe of elderly warrior women who tear across the sandy wastes on weaponized motorcycles, saying things like \u201cI killed everyone I ever met out here.\u201d Isolated between these two poles is Furiosa, with her steampunk prosthetic arm and oil-greased cranium. Theron, in a commanding performance, plays this character as a prototypical loner of the Clint Eastwood school\u2014an individual with her own deadly serious agenda. There\u2019s no romantic spark between her and Max: after a slam-bang fight scene that ends in a draw, they settle into a relationship of mutual respect. A useful thing, given the murderous forces arrayed against them.\n\nIt\u2019s nice to have a thoughtful plot in a movie like this, but really, the plot is hardly the point. The picture is a triumph of production design and action choreography. There are some amazing handmade battle wagons, one of them bristling with spikes, like a turbo-charged porcupine, another fronted by a wall of speakers and a shredding guitarist (whose double-necked instrument also shoots out flames). Miller\u2019s commitment to real stuntwork and state-of-the-art camera technology produces scenes of enveloping clamor and chaos, growing more dazzlingly complex as the film\u2019s two hours fly by. And while he relies very little on CGI, there\u2019s one computer-generated tornado\u2014a towering wall of dust into which Max and Furiosa disappear\u2014that has an awesome beauty. (The real-life desert lands we see elsewhere were filmed on locations in Australia and Namibia.)\n\nHardy is an appealingly low-key Max, constrained by a Bane-like mask in the beginning and otherwise prone to melancholy grunts. And Nicholas Hoult (X-Men: Days of Future Past) is a lot of fun as a lovable-lunatic \u201cwar boy\u201d called Nux. But Charlize Theron rules this movie, her character a new kind of action hero who happens to be a woman. Over the course of the many years this film was in development, Miller is said to have contemplated a spinoff Furiosa feature. This is an idea that should maybe be moved back onto the front burner.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Tom Hardy is a worthy successor to Mel Gibson, but Charlize Theron rules this furious sequel.", "title": "Mad Max: Fury Road Is Where the Action Is", "url": "http://reason.com/archives/2015/05/15/mad-max-fury-road-is-where-the-action-re", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14316571642221.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Tom Hardy is a worthy successor to Mel Gibson, but Charlize Theron rules this furious sequel.", "title": "<em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> Is Where the Action Is", "image": "https://d1ai9qtk9p41kl.cloudfront.net/assets/db/14316571642221.jpg", "creator": "@kurt_loder", "site": "@reason", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 17548474116}, "article": {"tag": "HomePage", "published_time": "2015-05-15T13:00:00+00:00", "author": "http://reason.com/people/kurt-loder"}, "msvalidate.01": "212A68A07785B3080038A845C4EE8905", "google-site-verification": "-AmMiilAN-pnjWt369CUWae-VQ-b9wmH4fSGyhbkQxw", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=2"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fca168\"", "article_summary": "George Miller\u2019s Mad Max: Fury Road is a speed-metal classic.\n(He\u2019s played by Hugh Keays-Byrne, who also played Toecutter in Miller\u2019s 1979 Mad Max.)\nNow, at age 70, he\u2019s back in action, and he\u2019s still the most gifted director in the crash-and-burn game.\nBut Charlize Theron rules this movie, her character a new kind of action hero who happens to be a woman.\nDragged back to this dismal kingdom, Max is spotted by Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron), one of Joe\u2019s trusted lieutenants."}
