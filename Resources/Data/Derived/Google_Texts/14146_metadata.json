It has more than 177,000 followers.\n\n[NYT]", "article_metadata": {"description": "A group of Occupy activists are suing one of their ex-members for locking them out of the group's Twitter account", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "\u201cThroughout our brief history there have been opportunists who would use the name to build their personal careers.\"", "title": "Occupy Wall Street Activists Suing Ex-Member Over Twitter Account", "url": "http://time.com/3395791/occupy-wall-street-activists-suing-ex-member-over-twitter-account/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/180898995.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/180898995.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "\u201cThroughout our brief history there have been opportunists who would use the name to build their personal careers.\"", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Occupy Wall Street Activists Suing Ex-Member Over Twitter Account"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "technology, twitter, jason wedes, occupy wall street, wolf of occupy wallstreet, #tweetboat", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Technology, Twitter, Jason Wedes, Occupy Wall Street, Wolf of Occupy WallStreet, #Tweetboat"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8899\"", "article_summary": "The lawsuit says that Adbusters \u2014 the Canadian magazine that first called for demonstrators to occupy New York City\u2019s financial spine \u2014 opened the @OccupyWallStNYC Twitter account in summer 2011, according to the New York Times.\nA group of Occupy activists filed a lawsuit in a Manhattan court Wednesday alleging that one of their ex-members had gone rogue and hijacked the account for himself, locking everyone else out.\nAdbusters later gave the account to Marisa Holmes, an activist and filmmaker, who apparently shared the account\u2019s password with 14 group members who all tweeted from it.\nOr they did until this August, when one activist, Justin Wedes, changed the password.\n\u201cThroughout our brief history there have been opportunists who would use the name to build their personal careers and benefit financially from their association with Occupy Wall Street,\u201d said the group, adding that it disavows \u201cany connection between this individual and the movement at large.\u201dThe Twitter account has been mostly retweets since Wedes wrested control of it."}
