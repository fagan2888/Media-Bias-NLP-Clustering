Unfortunately, federal officials don't care for those sort of shortcuts, and the former police lieutenant has been arrested and indicted.\n\nFrom the United States District Attorney's Office for the District of Puerto Rico:\n\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico \u2013 On Thursday, December 11, 2014, a federal grand jury returned a 17-count indictment against former Lieutenant and head of Bayam\u00f3n CIC, Puerto Rico Police Department Sergio Calder\u00f3n-Marrero for conspiracy to commit identity fraud, unlawful production of identification documents, aggravated identity theft, attempted witness tampering and attempted obstruction of justice, announced Rosa Emilia Rodr\u00edguez-V\u00e9lez, United States Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Puerto Rico Police Department (PRPD) are in charge of the investigation. Calder\u00f3n-Marrero would obtain forged firearms handling course certificates, forge signatures of his clients, and use the notary seal of a deceased Attorney and Notary Public to circumvent the appropriate legal process and obtain Concealed Carry Weapons Permits illegally for his clients.\n\nThe feds say that over the course of two years, from 2012 to early 2014, Calder\u00f3n-Marrero pulled in $105,000 from his extracurricular business activities. They, rather unkindly, want to deprive him of his proceeds.\n\nOfficials like Calder\u00f3n-Marrero who lubricate the wheels of restrictive regimes and intrusive laws with the grease of corruption make life more livable for many people in a multitude of jurisdictions. Admittedly they're a second best to not having restrictive regimes and intrusive laws to begin with.\n\nBut officials like Calder\u00f3n-Marrero are certainly preferable to honest and sincere enforcers of authoritarianism, as C.S. Lewis noted:\n\nOf all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their own conscience.\n\nSpare us the tyranny, please, but if we can't be spared that, let it be enforced by the likes of Calder\u00f3n-Marrero, from whom a little breathing room can at least be purchased.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Reason.com", "description": "Puerto Rico has restrictive firearms laws.
