Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) swore on Fox News Sunday that the GOP had a plan in place in case the Supreme Court eliminated the Affordable Care Act’s federal subsidies, potentially stripping health care from at least six million people. He declined to say anything about that plan, however, and faced questions from an increasingly skeptical Chris Wallace.

Ryan promised the GOP will have a solution that will give people “freedom from Obamacare.” (Ahem.)

But when Wallace asked if that solution would allow those millions to keep they’re subsidies, Ryan deflected. “Well, we will have a solution that addresses this law,” Ryan said. “We’ll have a solution for the people caught in this law, so that they’re not caught in the lurch.” In response to several followup questions about the specificities of the GOP response, Ryan said he wanted to wait until the Court ruled before he said anything.

Wallace then challenged Ryan’s assertion that Obamacare was a “failed law,” noting it had insured 16 million people, covered swaths more with pre-existing conditions, and slowed the rise of health care costs, and noted the GOP had not proposed plans to replicate those successes. “For all the complaints, we’re five years into Obamacare and Republicans have still not come up with a coherent plan that will ensure that all of those millions of uninsured people will get coverage,” Wallace said.

Ryan responded that the GOP both had a plan but was waiting for the Supreme Court’s ruling to “customize its plan.” He then intimated that a GOP White House would be more effective at replacing the Affordable Care Act.
