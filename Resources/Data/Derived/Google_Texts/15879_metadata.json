That means about 160,000 Ohioans will be able to keep getting money to help them pay for their individual health insurance plans on federal exchanges.\n\nFor health insurance companies like CareSource, the news was good.\n\n\u201cWhen folks have been able to afford insurance, they are now seeking care for things they put off for 5, 10, 20 years, and we\u2019re changing lives with the Affordable Care Act,\u201d CareSource Ohio Market President Steve Ringel said.\n\nBut for others it wasn\u2019t that simple.\n\nOhio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s office expressed disappointed in the ruling. In a written statement attributed to Kasich\u2019s Press Secretary Rob Nichols, the governor\u2019s office said the law should be \u201crepealed and replaced with a program that relies on market-based solutions overseen by states.\u201d\n\nAt question was language in the health reform law that left open whether the federal government could provide subsidies in 34 states, including Ohio.\n\nThe conservative Buckeye Institute\u2019s Greg Lawson said the subsidies mean taxpayers are burdened with paying for other people\u2019s health insurance. The average monthly premium for Ohioans who get a subsidy is about $150, compared to nearly $400 for those without.\n\nWithin minutes of the decision, Northeast Ohio Democrats Tim Ryan, Marcy Kaptur and Marcia Fudge sent releases calling it great news for millions of Americans \u2013 and tens of thousands of Ohioans.\n\nRyan vowed \u201cto continue working to improve and expand this law, which gives so many the care they need and so deeply deserve.\u201d\n\nRepublican Sen. Rob Portman told reporters the decision \u2013 like the entire Affordable Care Act \u2013 fails to address key concerns, including cost controls. He, too, is talking about changes, including limiting malpractice lawsuits.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of things that can and should be done to allow people to have healthcare in a more affordable way,\" he said. \"And that\u2019s what we should focus on.\u201d\n\nRepublican Congressman Bob Gibbs went further, saying the decision \u201caffirms Obama\u2019s intent to throw more of the taxpayers\u2019 hard earned dollars into a bottomless money pit.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "description": "The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 Thursday to uphold subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.
