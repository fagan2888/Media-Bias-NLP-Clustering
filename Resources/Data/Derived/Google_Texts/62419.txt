A Largo woman and her 84-year-old father were killed early this morning when they were struck by a wrong-way driver in Seminole.

Her mother also is critical condition after the crash, which occurred just before 12:30 a.m. at 131st Street North and Park Boulevard, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

According to the FHP, Paul Edward Pulkownik, 51, of Largo, was driving a 1998 Ford Explorer westbound in the eastbound lanes of Park Boulevard when he struck an eastbound 2009 Hyundai Sonata driven by 58-year-old Isabel Martins, 58, in the intersection at 131st Street North.

Martins died at the scene, the FHP said, and Joao Martins of Largo died an hour later at Bayfront Medical Center. His wife, 82-year-old Arminda C. Martins, is in critical condition at Bayfront Medical Center.

A third driver — Isabel Martins' son, 23-year-old Matthew John Martins of Largo, who was following the first car in a 2007 Hyundai Sonata — suffered minor injuries when he sideswiped the left side of his mother's car and struck Pulkownik head-on, the FHP said.

Pulkownik also suffered minor injuries and was transported to Bayfront Medical Center, the FHP said.

It is unknown why Pulkownik traveled into the wrong lane, but alcohol use is suspected, the FHP said.

An investigation continues.
