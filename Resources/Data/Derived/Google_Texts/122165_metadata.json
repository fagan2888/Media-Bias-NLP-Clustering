Paul Ryan was about to announce that he had enough quiet GOP support to pass a nation-changing amnesty bill in June 2014 \u2014 but he was blocked when primary voters in Virginia\u2019s 7th district ejected Majority Leader Eric Cantor, according to a PBS documentary.\n\nRyan and Florida GOP Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart had gradually persuaded a majority of GOP legislators to back a still-secret bill that likely included Ryan\u2019s top priorities \u2014 amnesty for nearly all the 11 million illegal immigrants, plus a mechanism to allow companies to hire an unlimited number of foreign workers in place of Americans, including the 4.4 million Americans who turn 18 each year.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nIf House Speaker John Boehner had scheduled a floor vote, Democrats likely would have backed Ryan\u2019s bill. Once returned to the majority by the subsequent wave of naturalized migrants, the Democrats \u2014 as they are now doing in California and in President Barack Obama\u2019s White House \u2014 would solidify their power by gradually legalizing more illegal migrants, alongside the almost 1 million legal migrants that are given citizenship each year.\n\nRyan assembled the list of GOP amnesty supporters, dubbed a \u201cwhip count,\u201d after a go-ahead from Boehner.\n\n\u201cIn our conversations with folks, we started to whip it, and we were asking \u2018Yes? No?\u2019 and we were getting yeses,\u201d Cesar Gonzalez, chief of staff for Diaz-Balert, told the camera. By June 9, \u201cthe speaker already knew what our count was,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is Monday June 9th. After months of work, and countless one-on-one conversations, Paul Ryan and Mario Diaz-Balart, have carefully crafted a bill they know the majority of Republicans can agree on,\u201d the voiceover declares on the video, which aired last night.\n\n\u201cThey have the votes. They make an appointment to see Boehner, on Thursday,\u201d June 12, says the announcer.\n\nTuesday, June 10th, primary season is almost over. Washington is slowing down a little. The Diaz-Balart office meets for drinks after work to celebrate their whip-count. Then, is it 9 PM and a piece of news almost unimaginable in Washington breaks \u2013 a primary race that no one is even watching. [Rep.] Eric Cantor, the [GOP] House Majority Leader, the guy widely expected to take over Boehner\u2019s job, has just lost his primary to a political unknown. Dave Brat, the challenger, got a huge campaign boost from conservative radio host, Laura Ingraham adopted him and made a hard line on immigration his main campaign issue\u2026 It was Brat\u2019s opposition to immigration that got all the credit.\n\n\u201cNot exactly what we had planned,\u201d Gonzales tells the camera.\n\n\u201cBefore the [fall 2014] meltdown the Southwestern border, it is fair to say there was a majority of Republicans who wanted to take it up now,\u201d said South Carolina Rep. Mick Mulvaney, who supported passage of an immigration and foreign-worker bill. \u201cI was absolutely convinced that the Republicans and Democrats in the House wanted to fix the problem,\u201d he said, adding \u201cthat\u2019s kind of invigorating.\u201d Companies in Mulvaney\u2019s district rely heavily on low-wage migrant labor \u2013 not American-built machinery \u2013 for agricultural work.\n\nRyan is now trying to win the House Speakership. If he gets the job, he would have the power to introduce and pass a more radical amnesty-and-open-borders bill, including a bill with an \u201cany willing worker\u201d provision that would allow employers to hire foreigners if white-collar and blue-collar Americans decline the wages offered by the employer.\n\nThe video-makers closely followed amnesty-advocate Rep. Luis Gutierrez for a year, and filmed meetings between Gutierrez, Diaz-Balert and their staffers, plus allied lobbyists.\n\nThe video-makers made minimal effort to track business\u2019 financial calculations, what the public preferred, or opposition from pro-American legislators and advocates.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s business allies strongly back immigration, because it provides them with a pool of new workers, plus a huge stream of new, taxpayer-funded consumers.\n\nIn 2013, for example, Obama and the 1965 immigration law added at least 2 million new workers, and perhaps 3 million extra consumers, to the nation\u2019s labor and consumer marketplaces, even as 4.4 million young Americans began looking for jobs.\n\nWages flatlined, and the percentage of native-born Americans with jobs fell slightly that year. Correspondingly, profits spiked and stock-prices shot up 26 percent, adding $5 trillion in value to Wall Street.", "article_metadata": {"description": "PBS Documentary: Paul Ryan's Secret 2014 Amnesty Plan Halted at Last Moment", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "PBS Documentary: Paul Ryan's Secret 2014 Amnesty Plan Halted at Last Moment", "title": "PBS Documentary: Paul Ryan's Secret 2014 Amnesty Plan Halted at Last Moment", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Ryan-Gutierrez-FB.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-10-22T13:27:40-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/10/22/pbs-documentary-paul-ryans-secret-2014-amnesty-plan-halted-last-moment/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "PBS Documentary: Paul Ryan's Secret 2014 Amnesty Plan Halted at Last Moment", "creator": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2015/10/Ryan-Gutierrez-FB.jpg", "title": "PBS Documentary: Paul Ryan's Secret 2014 Amnesty Plan Halted at Last Moment", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "Amnesty, Diaz-Balart, immigration, Luis Gutierrez, migration, Paul Ryan,2016 Presidential Race, Big Government, Immigration,Paul Ryan", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-10-22T05:50:33-07:00", "section": "2016 Presidential Race", "modified_time": "2015-10-22T13:27:40-07:00", "tag": "Paul Ryan", "categories": "Big Government,Immigration,2016 Presidential Race"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3d74\"", "article_summary": "SIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTERIf House Speaker John Boehner had scheduled a floor vote, Democrats likely would have backed Ryan\u2019s bill.\n[Rep.] Eric Cantor, the [GOP] House Majority Leader, the guy widely expected to take over Boehner\u2019s job, has just lost his primary to a political unknown.\nRyan assembled the list of GOP amnesty supporters, dubbed a \u201cwhip count,\u201d after a go-ahead from Boehner.\nCorrespondingly, profits spiked and stock-prices shot up 26 percent, adding $5 trillion in value to Wall Street.\nThe video-makers made minimal effort to track business\u2019 financial calculations, what the public preferred, or opposition from pro-American legislators and advocates."}
