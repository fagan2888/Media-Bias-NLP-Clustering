It was expected all along that Sakic would say Roy would remain on the job, and that\u2019s what happened.\n\n\u201cYes, he will,\u201d Sakic said. \u201cWe\u2019re in this thing together.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche was 39-38-4 heading into the game against the Ducks, and will miss the NHL playoffs for the second consecutive season. In the three seasons with Sakic as GM and Roy as coach, Colorado was 130-91-24 as of Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all learning,\u201d Sakic said. \u201cHe\u2019s got the passion, he\u2019s a winner, he wants to win. The players know exactly what he wants \u2026 You don\u2019t always look at the coach. For us right now, we have to look and see if the players are going to buy into what it takes to win.\u201d\n\nSakic went on to express his disappointment with the Avalanche season and the team\u2019s performance and said all aspects would be discussed internally. Asked if team president Josh Kroenke, the son of owner Stan Kroenke, had signed off on Roy\u2019s return, Sakic said: \u201cThat\u2019s my decision. Josh is on board with all that.\u201d\n\nRoy has two years left on his contract.\n\nThe Avalanche went into the Anaheim game with five consecutive losses.\n\n\u201cTen days ago or 10 games ago we were in a great position to make a run for a playoff spot (in) a two-team race,\u201d Sakic said of the competition with the Minnesota Wild for the second Western Conference wild-card spot. He added he was \u201cvery disappointed to see how the team reacted. In many games down the stretch, you didn\u2019t see that emotion that you needed in the playoffs. The entire year, I thought we left a lot of points on the table with just blown leads in the third period, not managing the games very well. \u2026\n\n\u201cWe have to look at our core right now \u2014 the entire team, actually, but the core\u2019s a big part of learning how to win. We have to take a couple weeks off to reflect and discuss and figure out if these guys want to learn how, what it takes to win and show in on the ice by playing the right way.\u201d\n\nBut wasn\u2019t he talking about things usually tied back to the coach?\n\n\u201cTrue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, no, I\u2019ve had conversations with Patrick. We know we have to try different things next year. For me, it\u2019s not the coaching staff. I\u2019ve had enough conversations with different people. We all have to be better. I have to be better. Obviously the coaches have to be better and the players have to be better. We all have to look in the mirror and figure out why it happened like this.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I know by watching our hockey club, it was unacceptable to see from the start of the year, to the middle of the year, to the end of the year, blowing games by being undisciplined out there, turning the puck over a lot. We weren\u2019t a very good possession team, but a lot of that had to do with what we were doing, not what the other team was doing. We really helped the other teams gain momentum and we didn\u2019t do a good enough job. That\u2019s something we have to look at.\u201d\n\nThe Avalanche lost eight games \u2014 six in regulation and two in overtime \u2014 when leading after two periods.\n\n\u201cTo see us blow points in the third period, that\u2019s why we\u2019re here and out of the playoffs,\u201d Sakic said.\n\nHe noted that the Avalanche bounced back from a bad start to get back into playoff contention, but the late performance \u201cwas unacceptable.\u201d\n\nSakic said of the Avalanche \u201ccore\u201d: They need to take responsibility in doing the right things on the ice. They do the right things off the ice. We have a great group, but on the ice, especially when the game\u2019s on the line in the third period \u2026 we have great team speed and we have to play more north-south instead iof just trying to make something happen when it\u2019s not there. I always say that\u2019s respecting the game, respecting the puck and the situation they\u2019re in.\u201d\n\nAsked if anyone was untouchable, Sakic shrugged and said: \u201cWayne Gretzky got traded \u2026 We\u2019re going to look at all different options on how to get better.\u201d\n\nOn whether the Avalanche will be aggressive in free agency after July 1, something Roy has brought up, Sakic said, \u201cThat\u2019s something where we have to look and see what\u2019s there in free agency. It won\u2019t be anything where we\u2019re looking to sign an older for a long-term deal. Obviously, we\u2019d like to add to our (defense). Next year, we\u2019re going to be young, too. (Nikita) Zadorov and (Chris) Bigras are going to be here next year, and they\u2019re only going to be 21. We still have room and we know we will have to be patient when it comes to the back end. We\u2019re not going to look for the quick fix, but will have to explore options via trade or whatever avenue to improve the club.\u201d\n\nSakic said the regression hasn\u2019t shaken his confidence.\n\n\u201cWe have a plan,\u201d Sakic said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a quick fix. Obviously, we still have to be patient with some of our younger players, some of our younger \u2018D.\u2019 \u2026 We\u2019re confident that we can turn things around.\u201d\n\nOn the personnel front, Sakic said he had been impressed with the play of forwards Mikkel Boedker and Shawn Matthias, both late-season acquisitions who can be unrestricted free agents on July 1.\n\n\u201cIf it works out, we\u2019d love to keep both of them,\u201d Sakic said.\n\nHe also confirmed that Nathan MacKinnon, who missed the final 10 games with a knee injury, wasn\u2019t seriously injured and wouldn\u2019t require surgery.\n\n\u201cI think the knee was a little worse than what everybody predicted or thought initially,\u201d Sakic said. \u201cBut if he gets healthy, he\u2019ll go to the World Championships (to play for Canada).\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Joe Sakic: Patrick Roy will return as Avalanche coach for 2016-17 season", "title": "Joe Sakic: Patrick Roy will return as Avalanche coach for 2016-17 season", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/09/joe-sakic-patrick-roy-will-return-as-avalanche-coach-for-2016-17-season/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160313__Patrick-Royp1-1.jpg", "height": 468}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160313__Patrick-Royp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-09T15:40:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-21T13:12:45+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "It was more a formality than a surprise, but Avalanche general manager Joe Sakic Saturday confirmed that Patrick Roy will be back as coach next season.\nIn the three seasons with Sakic as GM and Roy as coach, Colorado was 130-91-24 as of Saturday morning.\nIt was expected all along that Sakic would say Roy would remain on the job, and that\u2019s what happened.\nThey do the right things off the ice.\nAsked if team president Josh Kroenke, the son of owner Stan Kroenke, had signed off on Roy\u2019s return, Sakic said: \u201cThat\u2019s my decision."}
