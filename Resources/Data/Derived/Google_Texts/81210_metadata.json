(Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)\n\nThe GOP presidential candidates are clambering over one another to respond to the Paris terrorist attacks by talking tough about Muslim refugees from Syria or otherwise demagoguing about Muslims in America. Nearly two dozen Republican governors (and one Democrat) have tried to declare their states closed to Syrian migrants. That includes three Republican governors who are running for president. A lot more along these lines may be on the way.\n\nA major new poll from the Public Religion Research Institute suggests these GOP lawmakers and candidates may be reading the mood of the overall public \u2014 and GOP voters in particular \u2014 with dispiriting accuracy.\n\nThe poll finds that Americans overall agree by 56-41 that the values of Islam are at odds with American values and the American way of life. Meanwhile, Americans are almost perfectly split on the value of immigration: 47 percent say immigrants strengthen the country with hard work and talent, while a depressingly high 46 percent say they are a burden on the U.S. because they take jobs, housing and health care. The CEO of PRRI tells religion writer Sarah Posner that the findings show an \u201cincreased xenophobic streak\u201d among the American public overall.\n\nHere are some of the more specific findings:\n\n\u2014 Republicans say in far greater numbers than Americans overall that immigrants burden the country rather than strengthening it: they support this view by 66-26.\n\n\u2014 According to numbers given to Posner by PRRI, 80 percent of Trump supporters see immigrants as a burden.\n\n\u2014 Republicans and certain voter groups aligned with the GOP are much more pessimistic about American decline than Americans overall. While Americans are split on whether America\u2019s best days are ahead of us or behind us, Republicans say by 58-41 that they are behind us. Tea Partyers say this by 65-33. And 60 percent of white evangelicals \u2014 a key voting bloc in GOP primaries \u2014 agree with this.\n\nAll of this lends more evidence to a thesis already suggested by many analysts: that the GOP coalition is increasingly drawn from the \u201cgroups most un\u00adsettled by demo\u00adgraph\u00adic and cul\u00adtur\u00adal change,\u201d as Ron Brownstein has put it. These are the voters that may be fueling the Trump phenomenon, and now, it\u2019s possible that the Paris attacks could encourage more of the GOP candidates to try to appeal to them with similar rhetoric. We\u2019re already seeing Ted Cruz launch spirited new efforts along these lines, as you\u2019ll see below.\n\nAs it happens, some Republican strategists don\u2019t think this is a good idea, as the Post reports today:\n\nRepublican strategists are divided over the lasting consequences of the refu\u00adgee issue, with some expecting grass-roots voters to rally to the party\u2019s increasingly aggressive tone and turn out in droves in the upcoming primary contests. Others are nervous about damaging the party\u2019s brand with controversial comments, such as Donald Trump\u2019s remark Monday that he would consider shutting down some mosques and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee\u2019s call to \u201cwake up and smell the falafel.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very worrisome,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, a former George W. Bush adviser who has worked with the Republican National Committee on expanding the GOP\u2019s reach. \u201cWe must always make the distinction between law-abiding Muslims, of which there are many, and radical Islamists who want to do us great harm.\u201d\n\nOf course, this new PRRI poll shows a rise in xenophobic sentiment among Americans overall, not just among Republicans. And that poll was taken before the Paris attacks, which means this sentiment may only grow more pronounced. So who knows: maybe Republicans can pursue this course without paying any serious political price for it in a general election.\n\n**********************************************************************\n\n* CRUZ TO INTRODUCE BILL BANNING MUSLIM REFUGEES: Ted Cruz has announced that he is drafting legislation that will ban the entry of any more Muslim Syrian refugees into the United States. As Cruz tells CNN:\n\n\u201cWhat Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing is that we bring to this country tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees\u2026.I have to say particularly in light of what happened in Paris, that\u2019s nothing short of lunacy.\u201d\n\nAs noted here yesterday, Trump has already suggested we may have to close mosques, and the question is whether the GOP candidates keep moving to the right to keep pace. Now Cruz may be setting a new standard for them to meet, too.\n\n* GOVERNORS CLOSE DOOR ON MUSLIM MIGRANTS: The number of governors who have tried to refuse Muslim Syrian refugees has risen to 23 and counting. Only one of them \u2014 Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire \u2014 is a Democrat.\n\nAll three GOP governors who are running for president \u2014 Chris Christie, John Kasich, and Bobby Jindal \u2014 have joined in the fun.\n\n* REPUBLICANS ARE CERTAIN PARIS ATTACKS WILL BENEFIT THEM: The Hill reports that GOP strategists are certain, absolutely certain, that the Paris attacks will be a big political boon for them, because they will focus the public on the administration\u2019s (and Hillary Clinton\u2019s) foreign policy record:\n\nWhen it comes to ISIS in general, and the Paris attacks in particular, some Republican critics suggest Clinton is boxed in, stuck between the imperative of appearing tough enough for the electorate at large while also trying to appeal to conflict-averse liberal Democrats who could react badly to any perceived Clinton \u201cbetrayal\u201d of Obama.\n\nOf course, the GOP candidates also have to advance their foreign policy visions, and those, too, will be subject to the public\u2019s judgment. But remember: Republicans always are presumed to have the advantage in this area, regardless of the specifics of any particular dispute.\n\n* RUBIO OPENS NEW FRONT ON GOP RIVALS: Marco Rubio is now attacking Ted Cruz and Rand Paul for supporting recently-passed bipartisan reforms to NSA surveillance:\n\n\u201cAt least two of my colleagues in the Senate aspiring to be president, Senator Cruz in particular, have voted to weaken the U.S. intelligence program,\u201d Mr., Rubio told a collection of corporate executives at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council annual meeting. \u201cWeakening our intelligence-gathering capabilities leaves America vulnerable.\u201d\n\nThis appears to be a reference to the U.S.A. Freedom Act. Rubio seems to be calculating that GOP voters care more about the terror threat than about Big Government surveillance. Something tells me Cruz will relish this argument.\n\n* THE PLUM LINE IS ON FACEBOOK!!! Have we mentioned that this blog now has a Facebook page? You can get most of our posts there, too. Come on over and \u201clike\u201d us.\n\n* TRUMP AND CARSON KEEP ON SURGING: A new University of Massachusetts Amherst poll shows Donald Trump and Ben Carson dominating: Trump has 32 percent of likely GOP voters nationally; Carson has 22 percent; Ted Cruz has 13; and Marco Rubio has nine percent.\n\nThat gives over 50 percent to the outsider/entertainer candidates. Republicans clearly are coming to grips with the possibility that one could win either Iowa or New Hampshire, after which things could get truly crazy.\n\n* REPUBLICANS STILL STRUGGLING WITH OBAMACARE REPEAL: Politico brings us the latest: GOP leaders are considering dropping the language defunding Planned Parenthood from their latest bill to repeal Obamacare in order to win over moderate Republican Senators who are wary of voting to defund the group. With some conservatives balking because the bill doesn\u2019t go far enough in destroying Obamacare, the current version might not even get 51 votes it needs to pass under the \u201creconciliation\u201d procedure.\n\nJeez. If the GOP majority can\u2019t even manage to force Obama to veto an Obamacare repeal bill, what good are they?", "article_metadata": {"description": "We're seeing a rise in xenophobia among Americans.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/WashingtonPostPlumLine?ref=hl", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "We're seeing a rise in xenophobia among Americans.", "title": "Morning Plum: Want to know why Republicans are demagoguing on Paris?
