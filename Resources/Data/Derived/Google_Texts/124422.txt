BOARDMAN, Ohio (WKBN) – Ohio Governor John Kasich is still in the presidential race after finishing fifth in South Carolina’s primary, and on Sunday, he signed legislation to defund Planned Parenthood.

State Senator Joe Schiavoni is upset that Kasich is cutting around $1.3 million in government money for the organization.

“We’re talking about a little bit of money that Kasich is going to come all the way home just to sign this bill to defund the rest of Planned Parenthood for services that young women in this area all across the state desperately need,” he said.

Schiavoni says 97 percent of women who visit Planned Parenthood are there for reproductive healthcare issues, not abortions. He sees the governor’s action as a way to appeal to more conservative values.

“He’s been able to get a lot of publicity as the anti-establishment candidate, the one that kind of is not going along with all of the Republican values,” he said. “I think in this particular situation, this is something that most Republicans agree with.”

The chairman of the Mahoning County Republican Party, Mark Munroe, says that Kasich signing the bill isn’t a make or break for his presidential campaign. He says voters need to look at each candidate closely before voting.

“Slowly, surely, people are going to learn about just what kind of a guy he is, and you know the last votes have not been cast yet. I think there’s still a good possibility John Kasich may find a way to get to the White House.”

Ohio’s presidential primary is March 15th.
