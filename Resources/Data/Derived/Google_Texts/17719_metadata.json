The average length of the hospital day dropped from 10.4 days to 9.6 days after the introduction of the checklists, which included 17 to 24 items.\n\n\"To our knowledge, this report is the first on the association of SSCs and 90-day all-cause mortality, which might be even more important than 30-day all-cause mortality,\" wrote study lead author Matthias Bock, M.D., and colleagues.\n\nAn accompanying commentary by William Berry, M.D., of the Harvard School of Public Health, and colleagues, said that the evidence of improved patient outcomes and quality of care indicates that the checklists should become standard in operating rooms and surgical centers.\n\nThe main problem, Berry acknowledged, comes with the difficulty of implementing these systems consistently.\n\n\"A focus on the systems of care and promotion of a culture of safety at the institutional level is necessary to optimize checklist implementation and realize its full potential. Effective implementation is critical to meaningful use of SSCs, which can lead to maximally improved outcomes,\" he wrote.\n\nAn array of evidence points to the effectiveness of SSCs at reducing mortality and complications. But a study conducted in 2015 supports Berry's contention, noting that SSCs will have no effect on patient outcomes unless they are consistently implemented with the support of hospital leadership and an equal buy-in from the surgical and hospital staff.\n\n\"The clear lesson for hospital leaders is that they cannot just dump a stack of checklists in an operating room--they must observe them being used,\" said the 2015 report. \"Are team members all present? Are they rushing, or skipping steps? If so, then the lapses should be discussed and addressed,\"\n\nTo learn more:\n\n- here's the study announcement\n\n- read the study\n\n- check out the commentary\n\nRelated Articles:\n\nChecklist can improve surgical patient handoff\n\nSurgical safety checklists may not improve patient outcomes after all\n\nSurgical safety culture reduces post-op infections\n\nWhy surgical checklists often fail", "article_metadata": {"description": "Surgical safety checklists can save lives and reduce lengths of stay but only if they are properly implemented in the operating room, according to a new\u00a0study.", "og": {"site_name": "FierceHealthcare", "description": "Surgical safety checklists can save lives and reduce lengths of stay but only if they are properly implemented in the operating room, according to a new\u00a0study.", "title": "Surgical safety checklists: Save lives and cut length of stay", "url": "http://www.fiercehealthcare.com/story/surgical-safety-checklists-save-lives-and-cut-length-stay/2016-02-05", "image": "http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/opengraphimages/updated/opengraph_fiercehealthcare.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "fiercehealth", "card": "summary"}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"mkto\": }", "revisit-after": "1 day", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=731085312", "keywords": "length of stay,Patient Care & Outcomes,patient deaths,surgical checklists,surgical safety checklists", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "Patient Care & Outcomes"}, "article_summary": "Surgical safety checklists (SSC) can save lives and reduce lengths of stay but only if they are properly implemented in the operating room, according to a new study.\nIf so, then the lapses should be discussed and addressed,\"To learn more:- here's the study announcement- read the study- check out the commentaryRelated Articles:Checklist can improve surgical patient handoffSurgical safety checklists may not improve patient outcomes after allSurgical safety culture reduces post-op infectionsWhy surgical checklists often fail\nThe average length of the hospital day dropped from 10.4 days to 9.6 days after the introduction of the checklists, which included 17 to 24 items.\nEffective implementation is critical to meaningful use of SSCs, which can lead to maximally improved outcomes,\" he wrote.\n\"The clear lesson for hospital leaders is that they cannot just dump a stack of checklists in an operating room--they must observe them being used,\" said the 2015 report."}
