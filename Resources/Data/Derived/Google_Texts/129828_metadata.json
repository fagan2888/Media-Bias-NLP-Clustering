When they couldn\u2019t be with her, various relatives would call to speak to her for a few minutes. On top of this were parking fees and the cost of grabbing a cup of coffee and a snack at the hospital.\n\nEleanor\u2019s granddaughter Wendy Fisher, 46, estimates that the family must have spent an astonishing \u00a31,500 overall in those final weeks, including \u00a320 a day on food for themselves and Eleanor, money on fuel, and sometimes more than \u00a320 a day on parking.\n\nThe sum itself is arbitrary, she concedes. But when they were at their most vulnerable, it now seems there was a steady syphoning of money from the family.\n\n\u2018We wouldn\u2019t dream of penny-pinching, but we were effectively being held to ransom at an incredibly difficult time,\u2019 Wendy says.\n\n\u2018We felt mugged but we didn\u2019t even notice it at the time. We wanted Nan to be comfortable and to be able to stay in touch so we paid for the entertainment system, but it was difficult for her to use and actually distressed her.\n\nAffordable illness: Surveys have shown that many NHS patients are spending more than \u00a321 a day while in hospital, including an average of \u00a32.90 on a phone, internet and TV\n\n\u2018She was completely bed-bound. Nan didn\u2019t use the phone to call us, but we\u2019d call her. The \u00a370 bill that arrived a few weeks after she passed away \u2013 from the calls we had made to her \u2013 came as a shock.\u2019\n\nTHE SICKER YOU ARE, THE MORE IT COSTS\n\nSadly, this is by no means an unusual story. While Eleanor\u2019s family say they were just about able to absorb the costs, for many in a similar situation, such additional outgoings are out of reach.\n\nCampaigners have now hit out at the \u2018insidious creep\u2019 of private companies offering what either should be provided on the NHS, such as decent food, or services that used to be free, like communal TV.\n\nResearch repeatedly shows that costs can be extraordinary. An online survey earlier this year by money-saving website voucher codespro.co.uk of 1,500 former hospital patients showed that many were spending more than \u00a321 a day, including an average of \u00a32.90 on a phone, internet and TV. The website\u2019s chief executive Nick Swan says: \u2018Food was actually the biggest expenditure for patients \u2013 on average they spent \u00a312.30 a day on meals \u2013 whereas for visiting relatives, parking was unsurprisingly the largest cost.\u2019\n\nFurther research backs this up. Recent statistics from Macmillan Cancer Support shows that 83 per cent of those affected by cancer were \u00a3570 a month worse off, often through incurred expenses, while according to the charity CLIC Sargent, parents of children with cancer spend an extra \u00a3165 a month, including paying for extra accommodation. And Bliss, the charity for premature and special-needs babies, found that parents of an infant admitted for neonatal care face extra costs amounting to \u00a32,256 during their child\u2019s stay in hospital.\n\nThe more serious the illness, the longer the hospital stay \u2013 and the bigger the final bill.\n\nTUNE IN AND PAY OUT\n\nToday, personal television and phone systems are installed at hospital beds, rather than all wards having a communal TV room. Payment is made by bank card and patients can purchase pre-paid bundles of TV and phone time.\n\nThere are three main providers of such services. Hospedia is the largest company, with a presence in 150 hospitals \u2013 the others are Premier Telesolutions and Hospital Telecommunications Service.\n\nHospedia spokeswoman Charlotte Collins says: \u2018Private providers have spent hundreds of millions of pounds installing and operating these systems so that the NHS did not have to pay for them from public funds.\u2019\n\nSally-Ann Hitchcock's late father John spend one month in hospital which saw the family spent \u00a3140 on a television he did not know how to operate\n\nPackages offered by her firm include those costing \u00a310 a day, or \u00a350 for two weeks, for access to 25 TV channels, wi-fi and radio.\n\nIn many hospitals, free communal televisions still exist. Yet one of the main providers, One Vision Digital, says in the past five years it has installed sets at just 28 sites.\n\n\u2018Hospitals have to pay us, whereas groups such as Hospedia do it for nothing,\u2019 points out managing director Paul Williams.\n\nPaid-for entertainment systems have created a kind of apartheid, according to David Hickson, of the Fair Telecoms Campaign.\n\n\u2018You have patients sitting next to each other \u2013 one with enough money to watch their favourite telly, and the other feeling ill and frustrated at missing out on their regular programmes,\u2019 he says.\n\nTHE PRICE OF CALLING A LOVED ONE\n\nHospedia says patients signing up to use one of its bedside systems get free outgoing calls to landlines, while they pay about 25p a minute for calls to mobiles, and incoming charges are set by other call providers. Hospedia says it makes about 35p a minute on calls made to its phones.\n\nCommunications watchdog Ofcom says the 070 numbers used by Hospedia typically cost 52p a minute to call from a landline, and there may also be a 51p connection fee.\n\nWE SPENT \u00a3140 ON A TV THAT DAD COULDN'T OPERATE The father of drama teacher Sally-Ann Hitchcock spent more than a year in and out of hospital before he died from prostate cancer in August. Sally-Ann, 44, from Surbiton, Surrey, says: \u2018Last summer I recall paying about \u00a35 a day for my father John to watch television. Often, he\u2019d just watch one programme, but the fee was the same. At that time he was in hospital for about a month, so that would have cost us around \u00a3140. \u2018He found the television extremely hard to operate \u2013 he was only 73, but he had to pull the telly down, and press clumsy buttons. There wasn\u2019t a remote control. \u2018This year he was in for about a month again. This time we didn\u2019t bother with the telly and he couldn\u2019t use the free radio because he couldn\u2019t bear the earphones \u2013 he couldn\u2019t even sit up. \u2018Two weeks before leaving hospital, he was moved into a side room where there wasn\u2019t any telly or radio at all \u2013 not even one for which you could pay \u2013 and he went downhill rapidly. \u2018Just having the news on in the background would have kept him in touch with the outside world. Illness is very isolating and he needed to know that the world was still turning.\u2019 During this time, Sally-Ann was diagnosed with breast cancer and was treated at the same hospital. She says: \u2018Parking was \u00a33 for two hours and my mother would visit twice a day \u2013 she spent \u00a3336 in a month. She brought food for us from home. \u2018There was a special TV room for people who were being discharged and I was given special dispensation to be in this room and watch it for free. \u2018Dad later left and went into a hospice, where there were plenty of televisions, and against expectations he lasted another three weeks. \u2018It may seem like a little thing, but it\u2019s a link to normality \u2013 it keeps your brain going.\u2019\n\nCalls from a mobile can be up to \u00a31.50 a minute.\n\nDue to its concerns over charges, Ofcom officials met Hospedia staff over the summer and urged it to introduce an alternative, cheaper service.\n\nAs a result Hospedia says it will switch from 070 numbers \u2018over the next few years\u2019.\n\nHickson welcomes the fact that hospitals have lifted the ban on mobile phones on wards, which were once believed to interfere with sensitive equipment.\n\n\u2018But many older patients, who are in hospital for a long time, don\u2019t like to use mobiles,\u2019 he adds.\n\nFEEDING THE METER\n\nParking is another major bugbear for frustrated patients and their families. In July, a newspaper investigation showed that 74 NHS hospital trusts made more than \u00a3500,000 from parking in the past financial year, with 46 taking over \u00a31 million.\n\nFurther research by Macmillan Cancer Support last year discovered that the average cost of hospital parking was \u00a37.66 a day.\n\nThe Department of Health issued new guidelines during the summer, advising hospitals to offer concessions including free parking for patients with cancer.\n\nLucy Allan, the Conservative candidate for Telford at the next Election, says: \u2018The chief executive of our local hospital says that at only \u00a33.50 a day, the parking charges are not unreasonable, but that soon adds up. Hospital parking charges should be scrapped altogether.\u2019\n\nShe points out that in some cases, although people qualify for an exemption they have to pay the parking costs and then reclaim the money \u2013 and that\u2019s not always easy to do if you are unwell and undergoing gruelling treatment.\n\nWendy Fisher adds: \u2018When Nan was on the cusp of dying, we were feeding the meter constantly. You can\u2019t pay for more than five hours at a time, even overnight, so we simply had to go backwards and forwards to the car park.\n\n\u2018What a thing to have to have to consider. When she passed away, I had just got back from the multi-storey in time to say goodbye.\u2019\n\nTOO LATE TO TURN BACK\n\nAccording to a 2010 survey by the Soil Association, almost two-thirds of patients brought in their own food because the quality within hospitals was so poor. More than 30 million hospital meals are left uneaten every year.\n\n\u2018Nan didn\u2019t like the food so we would bring her meals we had made at home,\u2019 says Wendy. \u2018While we were visiting, we had to eat and drink at the hospital \u2013 coffee at well over \u00a32 a time and expensive sandwiches. Drinks such as Coca-Cola all seemed to be about 50p more than at the supermarket.\u2019\n\nA 2012 survey showed that shops in hospitals were charging up to 50 per cent more than supermarkets for confectionery and soft drinks.\n\nDespite David Cameron\u2019s pledge at the Tory Party Conference last week to keep increasing investment in the NHS, Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, feels the Health Service budget is not always being spent on meeting basic needs.\n\n\u2018Hospitals should be properly supported by the Government without having to rely on charging patients and their visitors to prop up the finances. We urge the Department of Health to end the hidden charges on being sick.\u2019", "article_metadata": {"Rating": "General", "news_keywords": "Mugged,hospital,beds,The,NHS,s,hidden,charges,cold,drinks,snacks,bedside,TV,sets,phones", "original-source": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2780558/Mugged-hospital-beds-The-NHS-s-hidden-charges-cold-drinks-snacks-bedside-TV-sets-phones.html", "doc-class": "Living Document", "twitter": {"description": "Campaigners have hit out at the \u2018insidious creep\u2019 of private companies offering what either should be provided on the NHS, such as decent food, or services that used to be free, like communal TV.", "title": "Mugged in our hospital beds: The NHS's hidden charges", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2780558/Mugged-hospital-beds-The-NHS-s-hidden-charges-cold-drinks-snacks-bedside-TV-sets-phones.html", "app": {"id": {"ipad": 400442503, "iphone": 384101264}}, "image": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/04/1412436121853_wps_6_Hospital_Graphic_jpg.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "account_id": 15438913}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all,noarchive", "al": {"android": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2780558/", "app_name": "Daily Mail Online", "package": "com.dailymail.online"}, "ios": {"url": "dailymail-fb://article/2780558/", "app_store_id": 384101264, "app_name": "MailOnline"}}, "msvalidate.01": "12E6B4B813EB44C9BFC8F6A21F1D01F5", "fb": {"app_id": 146202712090395}, "MSSmartTagsPreventParsing": "true", "articleid": 2780558, "divclasspage": "articlePage", "keywords": "Mugged,hospital,beds,The,NHS,s,hidden,charges,cold,drinks,snacks,bedside,TV,sets,phones", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DailyMail", "published_time": "2014-10-04T21:10:45.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "author": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/search.html?s=&authornamef=Alice+Smellie+for+The+Mail+on+Sunday", "section": "Health", "modified_time": "2014-10-05T08:37:02.000Zyyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", "tag": "Mugged hospital beds The NHS s hidden charges cold drinks snacks bedside TV sets phones"}, "verify-v1": "DXwlrsxbqxSv+FTFkWUfgflBvFJfx2YbNf/HmABrVyY=", "y_key": "1a7e912afbfcab2f", "og": {"site_name": "Mail Online", "description": "Campaigners have hit out at the \u2018insidious creep\u2019 of private companies offering what either should be provided on the NHS, such as decent food, or services that used to be free, like communal TV.", "title": "Mugged in our hospital beds: The NHS's hidden charges", "url": "http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-2780558/Mugged-hospital-beds-The-NHS-s-hidden-charges-cold-drinks-snacks-bedside-TV-sets-phones.html", "image": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/10/04/1412436121853_wps_6_Hospital_Graphic_jpg.jpg", "height": 382}, "video": {"width": 636, "identifier": "http://video.dailymail.co.uk/video/1418450360/2013/04/1418450360_2319023295001_Cameron-speech.mp4", "type": "video/mp4", "height": 358}, "type": "article"}, "channel": "Health", "description": "Campaigners have hit out at the \u2018insidious creep\u2019 of private companies offering what either should be provided on the NHS, such as decent food, or services that used to be free, like communal TV."}, "article_summary": "Further research by Macmillan Cancer Support last year discovered that the average cost of hospital parking was \u00a37.66 a day.\nTUNE IN AND PAY OUTToday, personal television and phone systems are installed at hospital beds, rather than all wards having a communal TV room.\nPayment is made by bank card and patients can purchase pre-paid bundles of TV and phone time.\nHospedia is the largest company, with a presence in 150 hospitals \u2013 the others are Premier Telesolutions and Hospital Telecommunications Service.\nWhen 90-year- old grandmother Eleanor Taylor fell perilously ill, her anxious family kept a constant vigil at her hospital bedside for three weeks."}
