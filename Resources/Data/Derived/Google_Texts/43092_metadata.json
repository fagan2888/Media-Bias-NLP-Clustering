Her form of the disease, like Romney\u2019s, currently is in remission.\n\n\u201cYou think, \u2018She was diagnosed, she had a family, she was supporting a husband with huge aspirations, she traveled the nation doing a campaign,\u2019\u201d Pritchartt, deputy director of a political action committee in Washington, D.C., said.\n\nThis week, she got to meet Romney in Arlington, Va., at a book signing for \u201cIn This Together,\u201d a book Romney says is intended for those who are suffering.\n\n\u201cIn This Together\u201d marks Romney\u2019s third foray into publishing. She previously released \u201cWhatever You Want to Be,\u201d a book of advice for young men and women, and \u201cThe Romney Family Table,\u201d an anecdote-filled cookbook.\n\nNeither work takes readers deep into the \u201cvery dark, very lonely\u201d days right before and directly after Romney\u2019s MS diagnosis, nor her decades of work to stay healthy and raise money for a disease that threatened her ability to get out of bed in the morning.\n\n\u201cI wanted the book to be as honest as I could make it so that [readers] would be able to understand how difficult this is to go through,\u201d Romney says, referring to her 1998 diagnosis. \u201cAnd so I intentionally, you know, bared my soul a little bit.\u201d\n\nBare her soul she did: the book covers everything from the moment directly after his wife\u2019s diagnosis that a devastated Mitt Romney asked doctors how the pair might remain intimate to the angst caused by a Christmas season with her children and grandchildren that Ann\u2014who describes forgoing a career to be the ultimate stay-at-home mom\u2014essentially had to skip out on due to exhaustion.\n\n\u201c[I want people to know] it\u2019s OK to go through those feelings. It\u2019s OK to feel the despair and the discouragement,\u201d she says. \u201cBut then you have to realize that we are all in this together, and there is hope.\u201d\n\nRomney began writing the memoir after the 2012 election season, when husband and Republican nominee Mitt lost a second attempt at securing the presidency.\n\n\u201cThe book takes you through the years I struggled to get more energy. I am strong now and I\u2019m well now and that is the reason I\u2019m doing this. You don\u2019t have to think that you\u2019re going to be permanently that way. You can fight though these things,\u201d Romney says.\n\nSince her diagnosis, Romney has been treated by some of the pre-eminent neurologists in the country, including Boston\u2019s Howard Weiner, slowly discovering and blending together a mix of scientific and alternative therapies, including horseback riding, that work for her.\n\nShe details that journey in her memoir, acknowledging how fortunate she believes she is to have regained feeling in her torso and left leg after an aggressive steroid treatment caused her MS attack to retreat.\n\n\u201cEveryone is carrying a burden, and we can\u2019t always see it,\u201d Romney says. \u201cMS was a cruel teacher, and it\u2019s not like I\u2019m grateful I had it, you\u2019re never grateful for that, but I have to say that it taught me a lot. You have to recognize that life has challenges and none of us can escape those challenges.\u201d\n\nLast October, Romney announced the creation of the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, which will open at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital in Boston in 2016. The center will research treatments for diseases like MS in addition to more aggressive, untreatable diseases like Lou Gehrig\u2019s Disease (ALS) and Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nRomney calls both diseases \u201chorrible\u201d and \u201ca death sentence\u201d when compared to MS.\n\nStill, she knows her body could turn on her again.\n\n\u201cThere are advances being made all the time and that\u2019s encouraging for someone like me that is a little fearful of when that shoe will drop again,\u201d Romney says, acknowledging that her disease could grow more aggressive at any time. \u201cIt\u2019s still important to try to fund and help promote the research.\u201d\n\nWhile she intends to finish her book tour, which next stops in Winchester, Mass., and stay active in the fight for funding for neurological disease research, there\u2019s one fight she\u2019s happy to be out of: the 2016 election.\n\nAsked if they have any reservations about choosing to forgo a third campaign, she remains firm.\n\n\u201cMitt and I are really grateful for the opportunity that we had, to see the country and to have been involved, and we\u2019re still involved and watching it carefully, but every day we are so grateful that we are not in this race,\u201d she says. \u201cWe know we made the right decision not to get in.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Ann Romney's memoir, 'In This Together,' offers an inside look at how the Romneys dealt with her 1998 Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Ann Romney's memoir, 'In This Together,' offers an inside look at how the Romneys dealt with her 1998 Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis.", "title": "Ann Romney's Memoir Is Raw Look at MS Experience", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/annromney.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-10-07T23:27:19+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1OYLCTy"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Ann Romney's memoir, 'In This Together,' offers an inside look at how the Romneys dealt with her 1998 Multiple Sclerosis diagnosis.", "title": "Ann Romney's Memoir Is Raw Look at MS Experience", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/annromney.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "Marriage & Family", "published_time": "2015-10-07T17:19:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-10-07T23:27:19+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Ann Romney, Mitt Romney, Multiple Sclerosis, MS, progressive MS, In This Together, book tour"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fccb1e\"", "article_summary": "Like Romney, Pritchartt was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), a relatively unexplained neurological condition in which the immune system attacks healthy nerve-cell coverings.\nThis week, she got to meet Romney in Arlington, Va., at a book signing for \u201cIn This Together,\u201d a book Romney says is intended for those who are suffering.\n\u201cIf she can do it, I can do it.\u201dTo 27-year-old Grafton Pritchartt, Ann Romney is an inspiration.\nThe center will research treatments for diseases like MS in addition to more aggressive, untreatable diseases like Lou Gehrig\u2019s Disease (ALS) and Alzheimer\u2019s.\nHer form of the disease, like Romney\u2019s, currently is in remission."}
