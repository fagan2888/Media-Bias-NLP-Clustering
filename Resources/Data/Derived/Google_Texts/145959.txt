Appearing during separate segments of ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday, talk show host and rabble-rousing conservative pundit Laura Ingraham and soon-to-resign House Majority Leader Eric Cantor traded barbs over an unfunny Taliban-themed joke.

Earlier in the month, Ingraham — who lobbied strenuously for voters in the GOP primary for Virginia’s 7th District to oust Cantor in favor of economics professor David Brat — had made a joke to the effect that Cantor, rather than Guantánamo detainees, should be used as a trading chip to retrieve POWs from the Taliban.

“Instead of sending five Taliban MVPs over there, [Obama] could have just traded one Eric Cantor,” Ingraham said. “Sending Eric Cantor back for a little while … could help our economy, stop so much spending.”

Cantor apparently did not consider Ingraham’s zinger to be particularly chuckle-worthy, complaining on Sunday that her rhetoric ill-served the conservative movement, the Tea Party and the national political debate itself.
