This article originally appeared on\n\nDon\u2019t make the mistake of thinking you\u2019re [the] customer, you\u2019re not \u2013 you\u2019re the product.\n\n\u2013 BRUCE SCHNEIER\n\nLinkedIn released a new product today called Intro. They call it \u201cdoing the impossible\u201d, but some might call it \u201chijacking email\u201d. Why do we say this? Consider the following:\n\nIntro reconfigures your iOS device (e.g. iPhone, iPad) so that all of your emails go through LinkedIn\u2019s servers. You read that right. Once you install the Intro app, all of your emails, both sent and received, are transmitted via LinkedIn\u2019s servers. LinkedIn is forcing all your IMAP and SMTP data through their own servers and then analyzing and scraping your emails for data pertaining to\u2026whatever they feel like.\n\n\u201cBut that sounds like a man-in-the-middle attack!\u201d I hear you cry. Yes. Yes it does. Because it is. That\u2019s exactly what it is. And this is a bad thing. If your employees are checking their company email, it\u2019s an especially bad thing.\n\nWhy is this so bad? Here\u2019s a list of 10 reasons to start:\n\n1. Attorney-client privilege.\n\nYou use your email to stay in touch with everyone in your life from your family to your friends to your business associates. And you may exchange particularly sensitive messages with certain people like your lawyer, doctor, psychotherapist, or spiritual advisor. These communications are generally legally privileged and can\u2019t be used as evidence in court \u2013 but only if you keep the messages confidential.\n\n\u201cIf you let a third party have access to your privileged email, you could be waiving important legal protections,\u201d\n\n\u2013MARCIA HOFMANN, ATTORNEY AND FORMER SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT THE EFF\n\nTo be certain if you\u2019re concerned about the legal effect of letting LinkedIn have unfettered access to your email, you should check with your counsel\u2026on a system that doesn\u2019t have Intro installed.\n\n2. By default, LinkedIn changes the content of your emails.\n\nBe aware that outgoing emails receive an additional signature. Incoming emails receive additional LinkedIn profile data. The introduction of new data sources into a medium rife with security issues such as email is a dream for attackers. We\u2019re curious how long until someone finds an innovative way to phish through Intro.\n\n3. Intro breaks secure email.\n\nCryptographic signatures will break because LinkedIn is rewriting your outgoing emails by appending a signature on the end. This means email signatures can no longer be verified.\n\nEncrypted emails are likely to break because of the same reason \u2013 extra data being appended to your messages.\n\nIf you forward an email to someone else, the LinkedIn profile data stays in the email. What if you don\u2019t want it to? What if they don\u2019t want you to and it pisses them off?\n\n4. LinkedIn got owned.\n\nThis happened last year, and estimates of 6.5 million usernames and hashed passwords were leaked to a Russian message board. They were using unsalted hashed passwords, which is a terrible design decision. LinkedIn has a documented history of insecure design practice. So as anybody who has ever assessed a vendor would want to know:\n\na. Who did the security review of the Intro app?\n\nb. Are there outstanding security vulnerabilities?\n\nc. Can we see a copy of a Letter of Assessment?\n\n5. LinkedIn is storing your email communications.\n\nIt\u2019s metadata, or so they claim. In particular, the list of people with whom you communicated is saved because \u201cIf you are not connected with the person on LinkedIn, we may later suggest them as a connection on the LinkedIn website and in our other mobile apps.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The business social media network wants to rout your email.
