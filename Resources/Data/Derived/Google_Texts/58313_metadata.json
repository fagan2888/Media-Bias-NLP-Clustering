But her fingerprints are all over programs that are on newspaper front pages and radio and TV newscasts almost daily.\n\nShe\u2019s in charge of the Minnesota Sex Offender Program that is embroiled in a high-stakes court battle.\n\nShe\u2019s responsible for the Minnesota Security Hospital in St. Peter, where workers have been assaulted by some of the state\u2019s most mentally disturbed and dangerous people.\n\nWhen social workers fail to prevent the death of an abused child, Dayton turns to Jesson to beef up the state\u2019s child-protection system.\n\nAs a member of MNsure\u2019s governing board, she has been criticized for her role in what is widely regarded as a \u201cdisastrous rollout\u201d of the state health insurance exchange.\n\nBut Jesson also can claim credit for getting important stuff done on her watch.\n\nAt the top of her list: \u201cI feel really good about what we\u2019ve done for children,\u201d she said in an interview last week.\n\nIn response to reports of child maltreatment, she co-chaired a governor\u2019s task force on child protection that produced 93 recommendations for improving child safety. The Legislature enacted many of those proposals into law earlier this year, while state and county child services implemented other recommended policy changes.\n\nFormer Minnesota Supreme Court Chief Justice Kathleen Blatz, a task force member, said Jesson assembled a panel of child-protection system critics and proponents and built a consensus for reforms that addressed flaws in the system.\n\n\u201cI thought Cindy had the vision and leadership skills to form a very good task force that could produce first-rate results. I was not disappointed,\u201d Blatz said.\n\nJesson also spearheaded an effort to make it faster and easier for families to adopt children in foster care.\n\nIn addition, her department improved access for parents to quality child care, in part by paying higher rates for care providers that boost school-readiness.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m most passionate about improving the lives of poor children,\u201d Jesson said.\n\nShe\u2019s also fervent about making state government a \u201cmuch smarter purchaser of health care.\u201d At the direction of the Legislature and Dayton, the Department of Human Services, or DHS, has saved taxpayers more than $1 billion by seeking competitive bids for public health plans, such as Medical Assistance for the poor and MinnesotaCare for the working poor.\n\nIn addition to saving money, she said, her agency has also created incentives for public health providers to deliver better care.\n\nJesson said she\u2019s most proud of Minnesota\u2019s recent expansions of mental health services for children and adults. The state has increased the number of psychiatric hospital beds available and stepped up its prevention and intervention services, especially for kids.\n\nShe also oversaw a massive expansion of Medical Assistance, or MA, under the federal Affordable Care Act. That program now serves more than 1 million low-income Minnesotans, up from 750,000 in 2013.\n\nTo root out fraud, she created an Office of Inspector General in DHS to detect and prevent waste and abuse in public benefits.\n\nAlthough a recent audit found the department has failed to adequately verify the eligibility of people who enroll in public health plans through MNsure, the department reported that the inspector general\u2019s office has produced an eight-fold increase in the amount of money recovered from ineligible MA payments, boosted criminal prosecutions for child care assistance fraud and has increased background checks for people caring for children and vulnerable adults.\n\nOverall, Dayton said, Jesson has \u201cturned the agency around.\u201d\n\nJesson, 57, was born in Fort Smith, Ark. She was the oldest of four daughters; her father was a prominent lawyer, and her mother was a teacher.\n\n\u201cGrowing up in the South during the civil rights movement made a big impression on me,\u201d Jesson said. Her high school wasn\u2019t racially integrated until she was a sophomore or junior, and the community was dealing with tensions over who would be admitted to the local country club or permitted to swim in the public pool.\n\n\u201cWith my parents, I had a very clear sense of what was right and wrong and that these (racial) injustices were wrong,\u201d she said.\n\nHer father, Bradley Jesson, took on those injustices as a lawyer and community leader and helped produce \u201ca lot of changes for the good,\u201d she said.\n\nHe\u2019s her hero, she says. He has been a business leader, chairman of the Arkansas Democratic Party, chief justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court and a chairman of the University of Arkansas board of trustees. \u201cAnd he\u2019s a great family person,\u201d she added.\n\nA Presbyterian who has taught Sunday school on and off for 25 years, Jesson said the religious faith she was immersed in as a child also shaped who she is today.\n\n\u201cIt taught me the importance of caring for the least among us. That\u2019s fundamental to what we do here,\u201d she said during the interview in her top-floor office in the Elmer L. Andersen building in downtown St. Paul.\n\nAfter earning a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Arkansas and a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1983, Jesson, her husband and their new baby moved to Minneapolis, where the couple launched their law careers.\n\nTen years later, continuing her family\u2019s tradition of public service, she landed a job in the Minnesota attorney general\u2019s office, where among other things she litigated high-profile health and human service cases.\n\nAfter Amy Klobuchar was first elected Hennepin County attorney in 1998, she sought to hire a lawyer from outside the office with management experience to lead the civil law division. She interviewed Jesson, \u201cwe really hit it off\u201d and Klobuchar hired her.\n\nKlobuchar, now a U.S. senator, said Jesson \u201cwas a change maker. She combines street smarts with a calm, positive mood. ... She likes management, and she likes the law.\u201d\n\nJesson remains one of the senator\u2019s most trusted advisers and closest personal friends. But Jesson never campaigned for Klobuchar. She has made a few, small contributions to candidates but hasn\u2019t been politically active.\n\nIn other words, she\u2019s a policy wonk, not a political hack.\n\nJesson established her own law firm with a partner in St. Paul in 2001. She left in 2006 to join the Hamline University School of Law faculty and founded the school\u2019s Health Law Institute.\n\nAfter Dayton was first elected governor in 2010, he accepted a friend\u2019s recommendation to ask Jesson to help screen candidates for posts in his Cabinet, even though he hadn\u2019t met her before.\n\nEach day after he interviewed an applicant, he said Jesson would show up in his office with a folder packed with background information on the job seeker. \u201cI had never seen anybody as super organized as she was,\u201d he said.\n\nHe interviewed other candidates for DHS commissioner, \u201cbut no one impressed me like Cindy,\u201d he said. He offered her the job, and she accepted.\n\n\u2018ALWAYS UNDER FIRE\u2019\n\nDayton says he thinks Jesson has the toughest job in his administration, in part because \u201cshe\u2019s always under fire\u201d \u2014 from people who blame her for problems in DHS programs to legislators wielding budget knives.\n\nShe landed on the hot seat the day she started her new job. Dayton inherited a projected $6 billion budget deficit when he took office in 2011, and he directed her to cut $1 billion from the DHS budget.\n\nWith little lobbying experience, Jesson went to work with the leaders of the new Senate and House Republican majorities, as well as Dayton\u2019s fellow Democrats, getting both sides to collaborate on a budget solution.\n\n\u201cWe righted the financial ship without throwing people off programs or dramatically reducing benefits,\u201d she said.\n\nJesson made a lot of legislative friends in the process. \u201cYou\u2019d be hard-pressed to find someone here who doesn\u2019t like her personally,\u201d said Republican Rep. Matt Dean of Dellwood.\n\nBut Dean, the chairman of the House committee that oversees the DHS budget, faults Jesson for some policy decisions.\n\n\u201cWith the governor, she was in charge of the most disastrous rollout of any program that I\u2019ve seen since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d he said, referring to MNsure. \u201cThey launched a rocket that was not ready for flight.\u201d\n\nDean\u2019s counterpart in the Senate, DFLer Tony Lourey of Kerrick, said Jesson isn\u2019t responsible for MNsure\u2019s technological problems. But if she shares blame for a premature launch, he said, she should also get credit for helping to cut the number of uninsured Minnesotans by nearly half.\n\nDean also criticized Jesson for not doing more to stop the rash of attacks by patients on the staff at the state security hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten worse in the past several years,\u201d he said.\n\nJesson disputed that charge. While DHS has a \u201clong way to go on worker safety,\u201d she said the staff has made improvements in using fewer restraints and less seclusion to handle patients.\n\nWhile Dean disparaged some of her decisions, he also praised her work in other areas, especially implementing a \u201cfine piece of Republican legislation\u201d that requires competitive bidding for public health insurance programs, saving taxpayers more than $1 billion.\n\nAnother Republican, Sen. Julie Rosen of Vernon Center, said Jesson is \u201cnot at all partisan.\u201d While the two of them \u201cagree to disagree\u201d on issues, Rosen said the commissioner is just as responsive to GOP lawmakers as she is to DFLers.\n\n\u201cShe brings a creative flair to the job, she doesn\u2019t back away from tough issues ... and she manages (DHS) with a heavy velvet glove,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cI think she\u2019s a breath of fresh air.\u201d\n\nOutside the Capitol, many of the programs DHS administers \u2014 such as MNsure, the state version of Obamacare, and cash and food benefits for individuals \u2014 are unpopular with many Minnesotans.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an easy department to pick on,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook. As a result, Jesson has \u201ctaken a lot of heat unfairly.\u201d\n\nHe attributes much of the criticism to misunderstandings of what DHS does and where it spends money. Many people don\u2019t realize that three-fourths of its budget goes for basic health care and long-term care for elderly and disabled people. Only 10 percent is used for economic assistance or what traditionally is considered \u201cwelfare.\u201d\n\nThe turnover rate for DHS commissioners is one of the highest in state government. But Jesson has served longer than any head of that agency in at least 20 years. She\u2019s held the job for four years and nine months, while the average tenure for commissioners during that period is three years and seven months, according to DHS records.\n\nJesson said she has stuck with it because \u201cit\u2019s the best job I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nHow does she do it?\n\n\u201cAn important part of who she is is that Southern steel magnolia that she brings to everything she does,\u201d said her husband, William Mitchell College of Law professor Peter Knapp. \u201cShe is affable and polite with everyone, but she is at her core tough as nails and always has been.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,health,Minnesota,Politics,legislature", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "Duluth News Tribune", "description": "ST.
