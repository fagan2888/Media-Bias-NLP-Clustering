The bill could make an appearance on the Senate floor as soon as Wednesday.\n\nOn Tuesday, as part of Equal Pay Day festivities, President Obama is expected to sign an executive order essentially authorizing a miniature version of the Paycheck Fairness Act for federal contractors.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans are trying to combat the momentum Democrats are hoping to gain.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell slammed Democrats\u2019 focus on pay equity as detrimental to the economy.\n\n\u201cInstead of focusing on jobs, [Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid] launched into another confusing attack on the left\u2019s latest bizarre obsession,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor on Tuesday. \u201cJust think about that. The percentage of Americans in the workforce is at an almost four-decade low, and Democrats chose to ignore serious job-creation ideas so they could blow a few kisses to their powerful pals on the left.\u201d\n\nHouse Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican, criticized the White House for its own gender pay gap. News broke earlier this week that female White House staffers make 12% less than men in the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m seeing the news this morning and it seems that the White House is having a little problem on this themselves,\u201d Cantor told reporters.\n\nThe White House defended its pay gap, saying it was better than the national average and that men and women in the same positions earn the same salary.\n\nBut Republicans aren\u2019t taking their word for it.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018Paycheck Fairness Act\u2019 doesn\u2019t provide paycheck fairness for women. In fact, it will cut flexibility in the work place for working moms and end merit pay that rewards good work \u2013 the very things that are important to us,\u201d the RNC said in its release. The RNC argued that gender discrimination is already illegal and that the legislation would make tying pay to merit impossible for employers while opening them up to \u201cfrivolous\u201d lawsuits.\n\nThe RNC particularly criticized the president\u2019s own payroll and argued that the White House\u2019s claim that women make 77 cents for every dollar men make is misleading.\n\n\u201cWhen you use the similar methodology to evaluate White House salaries, it turns out that the median pay for women in the Obama White House is 88 cents for every dollar a man makes,\u201d the release said. \u201cWhen presented with this information, the White House says it\u2019s not a fair calculation. You have to compare people in equal positions, they say. Exactly! But their \u201877 cents\u2019 statistic doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nThe RNC said that men simply occupy more higher-paying jobs than women do nationally, so the math behind the 77 cents figure is misleading.\n\nA New York City-centric study released Tuesday analyzed six common jobs and found that women make, on average, 82 cents to a man\u2019s dollar while they\u2019re young, and 78 cents to a man\u2019s dollar after age 35.\n\nWashington Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the GOP\u2019s highest ranking female member, also spoke out against Democrats on the gender pay gap.\n\n\u201cMany ladies I know feel like they are being used as pawns and find it condescending that Democrats are trying to use this issue as a political distraction from the failures of their economic policies,\u201d she said.\n\nIn the end, the RNC aims to change the conversation back to GOP\u2019s favorite talking point: the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\u201cObamaCare is deeply unpopular, and they don\u2019t want to talk about how policy cancellations are hurting women, or about how women are losing access to the doctors of their choice, or about how it\u2019s meant smaller paychecks for working women (and men),\u201d the statement concluded. \u201cSo instead they\u2019re talking about the \u2018Paycheck Fairness Act\u2019 using dishonest rhetoric and inaccurate math.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a key part of Republicans\u2019 midterm elections pitch to women. In 2012, Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost women to Obama by 11 points. A CNN/ORC International poll released earlier this year found that more than half of all Americans think the GOP doesn\u2019t understand women.
