More than 90 percent of the previously disenfranchised teens registered to vote \u2014 and, to the surprise of many analysts, proved not so ready to rebel against their parents as might be expected.\n\nMany say the Scottish success showed that the voting age ought to be lowered to 16 across Britain and Europe. It happened, in part, because the Scottish National Party expected the youngest voters to back independence heavily. Surveys and anecdotal evidence, however, suggested that wasn\u2019t decisively the case.\n\n\u201cWe talked a lot about it at school the next day, how we voted versus our parents or our older brothers and sisters,\u201d said Sinead McLoughlin, 17, standing with her family outside the Edinburgh Zoo. \u201cA lot of my friends say they voted just like the rest of their family. There seemed to be more disagreement between the older ones, really. I think more younger people did vote yes. But we weren\u2019t quite the revolutionaries the SNP thought we\u2019d be!\u201d\n\nMcLoughlin voted Yes and was crestfallen at the result.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not too, too sad,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping the pandas will cheer me up!\u201d\n\nThat would be the zoo\u2019s most famous residents, Tian Tian and Yang Guang, aka Sweetie and Sunshine.\n\nOn social media, news that independence was rejected by a clear 55 percent triggered much grief and some nastiness in teen chat. Some denounced Edinburgh, which recorded the strongest anti-independence vote, as anti-Scottish. Many teens said, because pro-independence activists were so much more vocal and visible, the result felt like a shock.\n\n\u201cI kind of felt like I was the only boy in Scotland voting No,\u201d said Iain McLeod, 17. \u201cThen the next day at school, there was this big \u2018coming out.\u2019 Suddenly it seemed like everybody was standing up to say they\u2019d voted No too.\n\n\u201cBut you could tell the real believers for independence just by eyeballing them,\u201d he added. \u201cYou didn\u2019t have to ask. They looked shattered.\u201d\n\nFormer British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, a Scot whose impassioned defense of the anti-independence side dominated the final days, said Saturday that he found the sight of students lining up to vote at dawn among the most inspiring moments of the campaign.\n\nOn the day of the vote, Brown said, his eldest son John asked him a question.\n\n\u201cWhy is it the case that some of the pupils in this school can have the vote and I\u2019m 10 years old and I\u2019m denied it?\u201d Brown told supporters to a gale of laughter.\n\nBrown said the passion of Scottish youth for voting mirrored that of democracy\u2019s founding fathers \u201cwhen they demanded that decisions \u2026 be made not by royal instructions, and not by elites ruling over us, but by people exercising their power through the ballot box.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Scottish teens proud, passionate about voting", "title": "Scottish teens proud, passionate about voting", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Scottish teens proud, passionate about voting", "title": "Scottish teens proud, passionate about voting", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/09/20/scottish_teens_proud_passionate_about_voting/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/britain-scotland.jpeg33-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scottish teens proud, passionate about voting", "title": "Scottish teens proud, passionate about voting", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/09/britain-scotland.jpeg33-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Shawn Pogatchnik", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd42e7\"", "article_summary": "Many say the Scottish success showed that the voting age ought to be lowered to 16 across Britain and Europe.\nIt happened, in part, because the Scottish National Party expected the youngest voters to back independence heavily.\nMany teens said, because pro-independence activists were so much more vocal and visible, the result felt like a shock.\n\u201cI kind of felt like I was the only boy in Scotland voting No,\u201d said Iain McLeod, 17.\n\u201cA lot of my friends say they voted just like the rest of their family."}
