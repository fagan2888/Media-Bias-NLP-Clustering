Scott DesJarlais (Photo: HELEN COMER/DNJ)Buy Photo\n\nDesJarlais talks Trump DNJ video by Scott Broden\n\nMURFREESBORO \u2013 U.S. Rep. Scott DesJarlais recently returned to his 4th Congressional District during a recess from Congress to spend time with his Tennessee constituents and examine their issues here.\n\nA Republican from South Pittsburg, DesJarlais stopped by The Daily News Journal Wednesday to sit down for an interview:\n\nQ: What is your response to the 2016 presidential race? Are you endorsing anyone?\n\nDesJarlais: I am not endorsing anybody. It\u2019s too broad a field right now. I think there\u2019s a lot left to see. I think it\u2019s interesting that it was all about the Republican presidential race. Of course, (Donald) Trump has been really interesting because he speaks with no political filter, and I think some people find that appealing because they are really tired of politicians promising things and not getting things done. That\u2019s not an endorsement of Trump. I just think it should tell people that they want to hear true speak and not political speak.\n\nAnd I think that the other thing that\u2019s interesting is that it seemed to be a foregone conclusion that Hillary Clinton was going to be the (Democratic) nominee. Now at the end covering up these top-secret and classified documents in her emails, which she assured us didn\u2019t exist, and she shouldn\u2019t have been using a personal server anyway. And my good friend (Republican U.S. Rep.) Trey Gowdy, who is heading the Benghazi Committee unearthed the fact that she was using a personal email server. And now the FBI has it, and we\u2019ll see what comes out. I know that Gen. (David) Petraeus didn\u2019t fare too well when he did that. Sandy Berger, (former President Bill) Clinton\u2019s former NSA director in \u201903 took some documents from the National Archive. He got hit pretty hard, and we\u2019ll see what they\u2019ll do to Hillary Clinton. But I don\u2019t think her candidacy by any means is a foregone conclusion. I think the fact that (Vice President) Joe Biden was in Chattanooga last weekend and had some pretty tough speak would indicate that he\u2019s serious about getting into the race, as well.\n\nIt\u2019s frightening to me that a candidate like (Democratic presidential candidate) Bernie Sanders, a confessed socialist, can get the interest of 20 to 30 percent of the interest of our nation. I certainly hope that\u2019s not the direction we\u2019re heading.\n\nQ: Although you are not endorsing any of the 17 Republican presidential candidates at this time, who are the ones impressing you?\n\nDesJarlais: I have been watching (Gov.) Scott Walker for some time now. I think he\u2019s done some good things in Wisconsin. I think (Gov.) John Kasich from Ohio might be interesting. Ohio is an important state. Certainly Sen. (Marco) Rubio and Sen. (Jeb) Bush in Florida would be good to be on the ticket somewhere.\n\nQ: You mean Gov. Bush?\n\nDesJarlais: Gov. Bush. Thank you. There\u2019s so many of them it\u2019s hard to keep them straight. Maybe they\u2019ve all been governors. No. Let\u2019s see, there\u2019s Ben Carson I think is an intelligent man. It\u2019s interesting to have non-politicians in the race.\n\nQ: Carson\u2019s like you, a medical doctor, right?\n\nDesJarlais: He\u2019s got something right, right out of the gate. There\u2019s just a really interesting field right now. We need to see more debates and see how that evolves. I\u2019m watching a number of candidates.\n\nQ: What are you working on right now as the representative for the 4th Congressional District?\n\nDesJarlais: I\u2019m working on several things. One thing that we have been working on because of the tragic shooting in Chattanooga is HR 3115, and that\u2019s a bill to ask the Department of Defense to review the directive that was issued in \u201992 that prevented our military personnel from being able to arm themselves and defend themselves in case of attacks on domestic soil. So that\u2019s a bill that we\u2019re working through in the House right now with 70 co-sponsors. It seems to be getting a lot of traction. It\u2019s bipartisan. We have all the members of the congressional delegation here in Tennessee. In fact, (Democratic U.S. Rep.) Steve Cohen from Memphis actually reached out early and wanted to co-introduce it, (Nashville Democratic U.S. Rep.) Jim Cooper, as well, is on the bill, and (Williamson County Republican U.S. Rep.) Marsha Blackburn, (Gallatin Republican U.S. Rep.) Diane Black, all nine of our congressman here. We are working on that, and, of course, we are paying a lot of attention to the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nQ: What is your position on the Iran nuclear deal that President Barack Obama\u2019s administration reached with the Middle East nation?\n\nDesJarlais: I strongly oppose it because Iran is not our friend. They need to have these assets unfrozen to further their terroristic activities throughout the Middle East. They are known funders of the Houthis rebels in Yemen. They are supporting the opposition in Syria. They are funding fighters in Beirut, Hezbollah. They are funding Hamas and their attacks on Israel. And they have openly stated that they need funding to continue those battles. So we are basically making a deal with our enemy allowing them to get funding back (from) sanctions that have been working and have been smothering them.\n\nPlus they want a nuclear bomb. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any secret about that. They claim to want peaceful nuclear energy, but there\u2019s means to do that without having to have centrifuges, without having to enrich your own uranium. There\u2019s several countries that use a one, two, three plan, where the fuel comes in from an outside source like the United States or Russia, and they use the fuel, and then we pick it up. So they have no need for centrifuges. But Iran wants to keep their capabilities because ultimately they want the bomb. They get to continue to develop ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles).\n\nWe know that they are a threat to Israel. We know that they are a threat to the United States. And why we are even talking to basically a sworn enemy in this fashion is beyond logic, other than maybe the president wants some kind of legacy issue for his presidency. I have listened to all the top-secret briefings on foreign affairs. We\u2019ve had (U.S. Secretary of State John) Kerry in several times, and I\u2019m convinced this is a bad deal. And I know they are trying to sell it as, \u2018We have no alternative,\u2019 but sanctions are working. Tighter sanctions would work better.\n\nQ: If Congress votes against the deal, will the Senate and House be able to come up with the two-thirds vote necessary to override a presidential veto?\n\nDesJarlais: It\u2019s going to be really close. If we don\u2019t get it, it\u2019s going to be close, and the president will definitively own this deal. He\u2019s been trying to sell it to people, and from what I\u2019m hearing, they are not buying it. I think it\u2019s propaganda at this point. So first of all, he\u2019s going to have to explain why when two-thirds of the country is opposed to his idea that he still thinks it\u2019s a good thing. I\u2019m not sure that we won\u2019t be able to override the veto. But if we don\u2019t, then we\u2019ll see how Iran behaves. One, they don\u2019t have a good track record. The track record over the last four or five decades has been terrible. I don\u2019t think they will honor the agreement. I think it will fall apart at some point anyway. We will continue to express our view clearly. We\u2019ll see what Israel does. They are going to put a lot of pressure on the people in Congress in the House and the Senate to vote against the president. So I think there\u2019s a lot to unfold here in the next month.\n\nQ: Two of your past Democratic opponents, Lenda Sherrell and former U.S. Rep. Lincoln Davis, are advocating new Clean Power Plan rules on carbon emission by President Obama and the Environmental Protection Agency. What is your position on this?\n\nDesJarlais: The EPA has kind of got a big black eye right now because what happened in Colorado. When they make a mistake and pollute a river and tell people, \u2018Nothing to see here. Look away. No big deal.\u2019 But if it\u2019s a private entity, they go after it until the end of time. So they have lost a lot of credibility, much like the IRS did through their targeting scandal and their wasteful spending on retreats and whatnot. So I think the EPA is in trouble. We all want clean air. We want clean water. But it\u2019s an organization or a department that has kind of gone beyond its scope like so much of our federal government. It needs to be reined in. A lot of people think it needs to be defunded and eliminated, but certainly it\u2019s got a broader reach. We are seeing this with the waters of the U.S. The president is circumventing Congress. He\u2019s using a lot of climate-change issues again in a manner that circumvents Congress. So I think it\u2019s always good to look at the facts, but I think most people agree that it makes it very hard for people to do business. You look around the world, the president has basically curtailed clean coal in this country. They jumped through all the hoops to make it acceptable to use coal. And now instead of letting them use it, he\u2019s pushing toward these green-energy initiatives, highly subsidized initiatives and sending our coal to other countries to pollute the world and where they don\u2019t have clean-coal technology.\n\nQ: About 65 percent of eligible veterans have chosen private medical providers since Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014, Veterans Affairs officials reported recently at York VA Medical Campus in Murfreesboro. What can you tell me about what you and Congress are doing to improve Veterans Affairs services?\n\nDesJarlais: The VA has had a lot of issues. Basically, the whole nation\u2019s health-care system has had a lot of issues, whether you want to look at Medicare, Medicaid. Certainly, the VA has had a horrendous track record here, a lot of controversy and turmoil. We passed a lot of legislation through the House to help correct these problems. Right here at home in Murfreesboro, we are hearing a lot of issues come up at the facility. We were going to visit there (Wednesday). Unfortunately, they were not able to accommodate us. We reached out trying to meet with them next week, to meet with Mr. (Juan) Morales (director of the Tennessee Valley Healthcare System that oversees York) about issues we\u2019re hearing. The veterans care all across the nation has not been what it should be. So I think that taking steps to allow veterans to use private health-care facilities is a step in the right direction. And I\u2019m not sure that maybe it isn\u2019t time to move to that system completely where a veteran can use a VA card or maybe be issued a Medicare-slash-VA card where they can use it anywhere around the country, and not necessarily abolish VAs, but why not let them get health care like the rest of America does and not be limited to the restraints of their system and their scheduling.\n\nQ: What is your response to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s recent 6-3 ruling that the Affordable Care Act permits tax subsidies for people who signed up for insurance through federal exchanges instead of state exchanges as the law stated?\n\nDesJarlais: Obviously, it\u2019s a huge disappointment to our office because the King v. Burrell case was a case we were out in front of, and you and I have talked about this several times about the difference between state and federal exchanges. And I think rather than doing their job, they looked at it more from a human standpoint rather than the technical standpoint of the law and how the bill was written. And whether that\u2019s right or wrong, the bottom line is that the law isn\u2019t working. It\u2019s not covering what it was supposed to. The roll out was expensive. People\u2019s insurance premiums are skyrocketing. Their deductibles are skyrocketing. It\u2019s going to get much worse here in Tennessee. BlueCross (says) in 2016, you can look at 30, 35 percent increases. So there\u2019s a lot of bad things yet to come. So for them to make that decision in my opinion wasn\u2019t really doing their job. This is Congress\u2019 job to write these laws. It\u2019s their job to interpret them. And I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the law was not written equally for those two. I think the reason for the ruling was not correct, and it\u2019s going to hurt people in the long run. We need to get back to private-based health care. Get the federal government out of the way. We need doctors and patients making decisions, not unelected bureaucrats.\n\nQ: If you could craft a new law to replace the Affordable Care Act, what would the legislation do?\n\nDesJarlais: Let people have a say in what kind of health care they need. Right now, the government is telling you what you have to have and that you have to have it. And I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s even constitutional. But if you have tax incentives for people to buy health insurance, that\u2019s makes it more affordable. Insurance across state lines makes it more affordable. Health savings accounts were working, and that\u2019s something that people should have access to. And all those things kind of went away with this. And to me, the American people did not want socialized medicine from the get-go. When I first campaigned in 2010, I said, \u2018This was a funnel into socialized medicine.\u2019 It\u2019s absolutely a funnel into socialized medicine. Those programs don\u2019t work in other countries. You can ask people, and they say, \u2018It\u2019s a great program as long as you\u2019re not sick.\u2019 And so that doesn\u2019t work out very well. So private-sector, free enterprise works better because it creates competition, lowers prices, improves access, and everything that the Affordable Health Care Act is doing we need to do basically the opposite within the private sector and let people be back in charge of their health care and get the government out of the way. They are failing on the VA. They are failing on Medicare. They are failing on Medicaid. We don\u2019t need to fail with one-sixth of our economy.\n\nQ: Immigration remains a key issue in the presidential election. What is your position on immigration?\n\nDesJarlais: I think the biggest thing with immigration right now is a lack of enforcement of our own laws. We are simply looking the other way. People (who) come into this country don\u2019t respect our laws. They don\u2019t fear our laws because there seems to be no repercussions. There\u2019s a lot of talk about securing the borders, which I think is important, but I also think that none of it\u2019s going to work unless we actually enforce the laws that are in the books. If we enforce the laws that we have now, the problem would essentially go away, but for some reason people don\u2019t have the stomach to do that.\n\nQ: Should Congress make it a felony to sneak into the country?\n\nDesJarlais: I don\u2019t know that it needs to be a felony, but any time you are breaking a law, whether it\u2019s a speeding ticket or a theft, there\u2019s consequences. And right now, we know if we travel to another country and we break their laws, we are going to be punished. We wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we were thrown in jail. But when that happens in this country, there seems to be all kinds of excuses why we can look the other way. I think that\u2019s the bad way to start a relationship with somebody wanting to be an American is the first step you do is to break a law. I say shame on them for breaking our laws, and I say shame on us for not enforcing them.\n\nContact Scott Broden at 615-278-5158. Follow him on Twitter @ScottBroden.\n\nAbout U.S. Rep.
