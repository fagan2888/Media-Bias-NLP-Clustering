Interparfums Spends $108M for Rochas, Experiments with Fashion

The $108M acquisition of the brand from P&G adds fashion to the buyer's perfume business

Interparfums is buying luxury brand Rochas from the Proctor & Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) for $108 million, adding a spritz of fashion to its perfume-only business.

Rochas, headquartered in Paris, was founded by Marcel Rochas in 1925 as a fashion house, and expanded into fragrances in the '50s. The business generated $46 million in revenue between 2013 and 2014. The deal includes all brand names and registered trademarks for the brand.

Paris-based Interparfums develops, manufactures and distributes perfumes and cosmetics as the exclusive licensee for Montblanc, Jimmy Choo, Karl Lagerfeld, Boucheron, Van Cleef & Arpels, Paul Smith, S.T. Dupont, Balmain and Repetto. The business also owns Lanvin Perfumes.

The company is financing the deal entirely through a medium term loan. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2015.

Cincinnati-based Procter & Gamble is known mainly for household, grooming, and family care products, including Pantene, Crest and Pampers.

Ohana & Co. and Jones Day advised P&G on the deal. Darrios Villey was Interparfum's legal counsel for the transaction.

There have been several deals in the beauty sector recently. In January, PE firm Wasserstein & Co. LP bought Paris Presents, a cosmetic and bath accessories business. Before that, last November, the Estée Lauder Cos. (NYSE: EL) added luxury perfume group Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle.
