And they\u2019re creating jobs at a faster clip, too.\n\nFor the fifth consecutive year, 2015 is expected to see another big expansion, according to projections from the International Franchise Association.\n\nThe organization recently released its Franchise Business Economic Outlook for the year.\n\nIn an official release announcing the report, IFA President and CEO Steve Caldeira said:\n\n\u201cFranchising is a vital engine of economic expansion in the United States and 2015 looks to be another strong year for franchise businesses. With continued job gains, consumer spending will accelerate creating the conditions for another strong year of growth for franchise businesses.\u201d\n\nSome positives outlined in the IFA survey include:\n\nNew Jobs: Franchises are expected to add 247,000 jobs this year. That\u2019s a 2.9 percent increase over 2014\u2019s gains. And it brings the total number of jobs in place at franchise businesses to 8.8 million nationwide.\n\nFranchises are expected to add 247,000 jobs this year.

Greater Output: With more franchise businesses comes more economic output, the IFA report notes. In 2015, franchise businesses should generate $889 billion in business. That\u2019s a 5.4 percent increase over 2014.\n\nWith more franchise businesses comes more economic output, the IFA report notes. In 2015, franchise businesses should generate $889 billion in business. That\u2019s a 5.4 percent increase over 2014. Growing GDP: The Gross Domestic Product among franchise businesses should grow 5.1 percent this year. The national GDP is expected to grow 4.9 percent, meaning franchise businesses should grow at a faster rate than the economy as a whole.\n\nBut despite this momentum, there are reasons for concern.\n\nAlready, franchise business owners are reporting negative impacts after the implementation and enforcement of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nTwo-thirds of the franchisors and 85 percent of franchisees say they have been negatively impacted by Obamacare.\n\nAnd recent changes to the minimum wage at the state and local level have also had an impact on franchise businesses.\n\nThe IFA report found that 85 percent of franchisors and franchisees believe that local or state changes to the minimum wage will have a negative impact on their business.\n\nBut one of the greatest concerns for franchisers is a recent filing by the National Board of Labor Relations.\n\nThe NBLR alleges McDonald\u2019 s Corp. LLC acted as a \u201cjoint employer\u201d with some of its franchisees in 2012 in response to a push by some employees for higher wages. The move attempts to make the company equally responsible for alleged misconduct against employees for union organizing activities at some of the restaurants.\n\nA statement from the NBLR alleges these activities included discriminatory discipline, reduction in hours and, in some cases, discharges. In a statement, the NBLR explains:\n\n\u201c(McDonald\u2019s) engages in sufficient control over its franchisees\u2019 operations, beyond protection of the brand, to make it a putative joint employer with its franchisees. This finding is further supported by McDonald\u2019s, USA, LLC\u2019s nationwide response to franchise employee activities while participating in fast food worker protests to improve their wages and working conditions.\u201d\n\nBut, in its report, the IFA responded that the decision left franchisees, small business owners who had bought into the McDonald\u2019s business model, uncertain about where they stood. As Caldeira stated:\n\n\u201cThe entire business model of franchising is endangered by this ill-conceived complaint. Hundreds of thousands of franchisees must now operate not knowing whether they should believe what their contracts clearly state, that they are in charge of their own work place practices, including setting wages and hours, or that the corporations from which they license their trademarks are also responsible for those things. The ruling could put the brakes on what looks like a banner year of accelerated growth and job creation in the franchise sector.\u201d\n\nAccording to the IFA report, 85 percent of those surveyed believed the decision by the federal agency would be \u201csignificant.\u201d And many wonder about the implications to other franchises as well.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Franchise business growth continues rapidly, growing faster than any other sector of the economy.
