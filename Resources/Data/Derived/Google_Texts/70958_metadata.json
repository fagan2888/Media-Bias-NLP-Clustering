But it hasn\u2019t healed enough to get him back on the field. Thomas warmed up with the Broncos on Thursday but didn\u2019t run any pass routes.\n\nLinebacker Brandon Marshall, who suffered a concussion during the Miami game last Sunday, exercised Thursday but didn\u2019t participate in drills. He must clear the NFL-mandated concussion protocol before returning fully.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just day to day,\u201d coach John Fox said of Thomas and Marshall. \u201cI don\u2019t like trying to predict the future. We\u2019ll take it one day at a time and see where they are (Friday).\u201d\n\nTalking touchbacks. This week, the Broncos signed Connor Barth to a two-year contract with the hope that he would bring a needed change to their kicking game.\n\nSince Matt Prater was waived, the Broncos have gone from being one of the top kicking teams in the NFL to the worst in field goals.\n\nBarth is expected to kick off for Denver, something he hasn\u2019t done since the 2010 season. He had only one touchback that year.\n\nBut with Barth on board, the Broncos\u2019 special teams are keeping the same plan with coverages.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re preparing for it to come out of the end zone after every point,\u201d Andre Caldwell said. \u201cWe\u2019re not changing anything at all (with coverages). We don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll kick touchbacks or kick them short; we just go out there ready to make a tackle.\u201d\n\nColquitt praying for Berry. Britton Colquitt played at the University of Tennessee with Chiefs safety Eric Berry from 2007-08, and the Denver punter was shocked when he heard about Berry\u2019s possible cancer diagnosis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just terrible,\u201d Colquitt said. \u201cJust pray for healing and peace for him and his family. He\u2019s a good dude and has a good head on his shoulders, so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to affect a guy like him more than it maybe would somebody else.\n\n\u201cYou just hate to see that happen to anyone, let alone such a gifted athlete and great person.\u201d\n\nPeyton proud of Beckham. Odell Beckham Jr.\u2019s acrobatic, one-handed touchdown catch for the Giants on a pass thrown by Eli Manning last Sunday against the Cowboys caught the attention of nearly everyone, in and out of the NFL.\n\nPeyton Manning was no exception. The Denver quarterback saw the extraordinary reception live on television and admitted it was \u201cas fine a catch as I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was watching it on TV, and it\u2019s just what Newman graduates do,\u201d Manning said, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s what happens.\u201d\n\nBeckham, a rookie wide receiver from LSU, grew up in New Orleans and graduated from the same high school as the Manning brothers: Isidore Newman.
