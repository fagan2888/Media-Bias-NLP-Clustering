Brian Zierlein said at 9:40 p.m. \u201cIt sounds like they had only one rope.\u201d\n\nZierlein said a highly trained Rocky Mountain Rescue team was on the famous Third Flatiron in search of an unknown number of people stuck somewhere high on its sheer rock slope.\n\n\u201cGod bless these guys, climbing in the dark on this stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nThe Flatirons are a series of sheer rock walls that jut almost vertically, like mammoth clothes irons, over the city of Boulder and the University of Colorado campus. The climbers called for help at the south end of the formation.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many climbers were up there hours after sunset, exactly where they got stranded or whether the rescue team would try to pull them up or rappel them down. Because of pitch-dark conditions, the rescue effort progressed slowly.\n\nChris Baker, a dispatcher for the sheriff\u2019s office, said it was not unusual for climbers to ascend the Flatirons late on warm Saturday afternoons.\n\n\u201cThe weekends are pretty busy,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Third Flatiron is among the steepest and busiest multi-pitch routes in the world. It is also a nesting site for falcons, which limits the climbing season.\n\nThe letters CU have been painted and removed from its face repeatedly during the last half-century.\n\nWhile a rescue may take hours, the Third Flatiron\u2019s slope lures some amazing fast speed-climbing athletes. The quickest ascent to date: 5 minutes and 59 seconds.\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or twitter.com/dolingerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Boulder Sheriff launches rescue for hikers stranded on Third Flatiron", "title": "Boulder Sheriff launches rescue for hikers stranded on Third Flatiron", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/09/27/boulder-sheriff-launches-rescue-for-hikers-stranded-on-third-flatiron/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/themes/denverpost/static/images/thedenverpost.png", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-27T21:34:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-09-27T21:34:22+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Boulder Sheriff\u2019s Office and a trained rescue team worked into the night Saturday to pull stranded rock climbers from a steep-walled Flatiron peak.\nThe unknown climbers \u201cwere kind of ill-prepared and got stuck up there after dark,\u201d Sgt.\nIt was not immediately clear how many climbers were up there hours after sunset, exactly where they got stranded or whether the rescue team would try to pull them up or rappel them down.\nWhile a rescue may take hours, the Third Flatiron\u2019s slope lures some amazing fast speed-climbing athletes.\nThe Third Flatiron is among the steepest and busiest multi-pitch routes in the world."}
