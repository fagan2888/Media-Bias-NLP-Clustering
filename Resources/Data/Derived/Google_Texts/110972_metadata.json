All the federally qualified health centers in the state offer dental care. \u201cWe really provide the backbone of dental care in the state for people who don\u2019t have dental insurance,\u201d she added.\n\nRhode Island\u2019s community health centers are also equipped to manage electronic health records, which allows other providers to view patients\u2019 medical history. Additionally, the state has no municipal- or county-level health departments, so the department of health has no \u201cboots on the ground,\u201d she said.\n\nThe R.I. Department of Health must fund health care reform ventures because it has no clinical capacity itself, she added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not small change in this business anymore,\u201d Hayward said, pointing to the $184 million in savings that community health centers provided in 2013.\n\n\u201cPeople think that NGOs don\u2019t pay taxes. But our employees pay taxes. There are lots of other ways that tax revenue is generated,\u201d she said.\n\nBut acquiring funding from the state government continues to be a challenge, Hayward said. While community health centers focus on decreasing long-run costs through efforts to reduce the risk of chronic diseases, she said, policymakers focus on a one-year budget.\n\nThe lecture was presented in association with BIOL 6504: \u201cHealth Care in America,\u201d a pre-clinical elective that serves as \u201can enrichment to the curriculum that we have in medical school,\u201d said Sanchita Singal \u201913 MD\u201917, one of the student leaders of the course. Singal leads the course with Sachin Santhakumar MD\u201917, Allan Joseph MD\u201917 and Ali Rae MD\u201917, and the course is advised by Eli Adashi, former dean of medicine and biological sciences and professor of obstetrics and gynecology, Arthur Frazzano, associate professor of family medicine, and Michael Lee, assistant professor of emergency medicine.\n\n\u201cWe invite speakers from all over different parts of the nation to come and talk about important topics in health policy,\u201d Singal said, adding that these issues \u201care really important for future physicians to know about as they venture into the world of health care.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Brown Daily Herald", "description": "The Alpert Medical School hosted a lecture Monday on Rhode Island\u2019s community health centers.", "title": "Community health center expansion brings savings, challenges", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Jerzyk_Health-Care_Ryan-Walsh.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-10-21T18:09:50+00:00", "url": "http://www.browndailyherald.com/2014/10/21/community-health-center-expansion-brings-savings-challenges/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"section": "Metro", "published_time": "2014-10-21T01:27:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-10-21T18:09:50+00:00"}, "description": "The Alpert Medical School hosted a lecture Monday on Rhode Island\u2019s community health centers.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Emma Jerzyk"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe13a9\"", "article_summary": "The R.I.
