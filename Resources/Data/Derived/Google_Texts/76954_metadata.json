Sgt. John Gordinier, an Alaska NORAD spokesman.\n\n\"It's one of the largest military community relations events we have,\" Gordinier said.\n\nHow Does NORAD Track Santa?\n\nA system of radar stations and satellites monitor all air traffic entering U.S. and Canadian airspace. All aircraft have a code to identify themselves. If an aircraft doesn't have a code, Gordinier said, NORAD can scramble jets to see who it is and what they're doing.\n\nLuckily, Santa is good at keeping in touch with NORAD, Gordinier said.\n\n\"When he pops up, we call him Big Red One,\" he said. \"That's his call sign.\"\n\nThe nose on Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer is a tipoff. It gives off an infrared signature similar to a missile launch, Gordinier said.\n\nWhat Is Santa's Route?\n\nSanta generally departs the North Pole, flies to the international date line over the Pacific Ocean, then begins deliveries in island nations. He then works his way west in the Northern and Southern hemispheres.\n\nAlaska is usually his last stop before heading home, Gordinier said.\n\nHow Do Children Participate?\n\nStarting at 10 p.m. Alaska time on Dec. 23, and for 23 hours covering most of Christmas Eve, children can call a toll-free number, 877-446-6723 (877-Hi-NORAD) and speak to a live phone operator about Santa's whereabouts.\n\nThey can also send an email to noradtracksantaoutlook.com.\n\nNORAD has 157 telephone lines and hundreds of volunteers ready to answer calls, including first lady Michelle Obama, who takes a break from her Hawaii vacation to take forwarded calls.\n\nNORAD also created a website, www.noradsanta.org; a Facebook page, www.facebook.com/noradsanta; and a Twitter account NoradSanta for the program.\n\nThe sites include games, movies and music. \"Santacams\" stream videos from various locations.\n\nHow Did NORAD Get Involved With Tracking Santa?\n\nA 1955 newspaper advertisement for Sears Roebuck and Co. listed a phone number for \"kiddies\" to call Santa Claus but got it wrong.\n\nThe number was for a crisis phone at Air Operations Center at Continental Air Defense Command, NORAD's predecessor, in Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n\nAir Force Col. Harry Shoup took a call from a child and thought he was being pranked. When he figured out he was talking to a little boy, he pretended he was Santa.\n\nMore children called. Shoop eventually instructed airmen answering the phone to offer Santa's radar location as he crossed the globe.\n\nThat sparked the tradition that is heading into its 60th year.\n\n\u00a9 2015 The Associated Press.
