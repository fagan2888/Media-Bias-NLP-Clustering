Next month, you can buy it.\n\nOak Lawn-based Heritage Auctions offered the ring during its weekend-long Sports Collectibles Platinum Night Auction in New York City. Last month the auction house\u2019s director of sports auctions, Chris Ivy, told The Dallas Morning News it could go for upwards of $40,000. Its new owner will pay $60,000 for the ring, and an additional $11,700 to the auction house in seller\u2019s fees.\n\nHarvey Martin died Dec. 24, 2001, of pancreatic cancer at a Grapevine hospital. He was 51. And according to an application for a temporary injunction filed late Thursday by DeVincent Martin, son of the late Cowboy, prior to his death Harvey\u2019s mother told DeVincent \u201cthat the prized 1977 Dallas Cowboy Super Bowl ring was stolen.\u201d\n\nIn January Chris Ivy didn\u2019t reveal who was selling the ring. He said only that \u201cthe ring is originally sourced from the family, but they are not the consignors.\u201d In 1998, a local sports memorabilia dealer said Martin often hocked his playing-days belongings to keep afloat. It\u2019s not clear if the ring was among the items sold.\n\nAfter reading about its pending auction in The News in January, says the application, DeVincent called Heritage to \u201cstop the auction.\u201d The application says Heritage told DeVincent \u201cthe ownership was through a Florida Memorabilia dealer; however, did not list the dealer by name.\u201d The suit was filed to \u201cpreserve the status quo\u201d while DeVincent attempts to prove ownership.\n\nCounty records show nothing beyond the application for the temporary injunction, but a Heritage spokesman says it was denied Friday, after DeVincent and his attorney T. Christopher Lewis couldn\u2019t prove the family owns the ring. Attempts to reach DeVincent have been unsuccessful, and an email has been sent to Lewis to ask about next steps.\n\nThe petition is below.\n\nSuit Over Harvey Martin's Ring", "article_metadata": {"liveFyreID": "aHR0cDovL3RoZXNjb29wYmxvZy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS8yMDE1LzAyL2hhcnZleS1tYXJ0aW5zLTE5Nzctc3VwZXItYm93bC1yaW5nLXNlbGxzLWZvci03MTAwMC1idXQtc29uLWNsYWltcy1pdC13YXMtc3RvbGVuLmh0bWwv", "generator": "WordPress 3.9.12", "author": "Robert Wilonsky", "og": {"site_name": "The Scoop Blog", "description": "The Super Bowl XII ring that once belonged to Dallas Cowboys defensive great and South Oak Cliff High School product Harvey Martin sold for $71,700 at auction Saturday -- two\u2026", "title": "Harvey Martin\u2019s 1977 Super Bowl ring sells for $71,000, but son claims it was stolen", "url": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/2015/02/harvey-martins-1977-super-bowl-ring-sells-for-71000-but-son-claims-it-was-stolen.html/", "image": "http://thescoopblog.dallasnews.com/files/2015/02/HarveyMartinSuperBowlRing.jpg", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2015-02-22T11:11:38Z", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "PublishDate": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z", "wp-parsely_version": "1.7", "viewport": "width=device-width", "google-site-verification": "ZjZz-aaVcLkLDp8kIkLnEwtSTZlAwGgQhLyd1pXAbA8", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2012-04-11T13:59:21Z"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd907e\"", "article_summary": "Related Dallas Cowboys great Harvey Martin won his Super Bowl ring.\nHarvey Martin died Dec. 24, 2001, of pancreatic cancer at a Grapevine hospital.\nSuit Over Harvey Martin's Ring\nOak Lawn-based Heritage Auctions offered the ring during its weekend-long Sports Collectibles Platinum Night Auction in New York City.\nIts new owner will pay $60,000 for the ring, and an additional $11,700 to the auction house in seller\u2019s fees."}
