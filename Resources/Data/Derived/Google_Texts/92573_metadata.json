Hall, a Hallstead Republican, will face challenges from newcomers Democrat Chuck Bullock, of Auburn Twp., and Republican Elizabeth \u201cBetsy\u201d Arnold, of Bridgewater Twp.\n\nIn mid-October interviews, the incumbents touted the county\u2019s financial health and their reinvestment in capital improvements while managing to cut taxes. Part of the county\u2019s success in this regard is because of natural gas drilling impact fees disbursed under Act 13.\n\nNeither challenger has held public office. Both stressed their valuable life experience \u2014 each starting on a Susquehanna County dairy farm \u2014 and commitment to the county.\n\nMr. Bullock was a banker for 28 years, ending his banking career as senior vice president at Grange National Bank in Wyalusing.\n\n\u201cIt gives me a lot of fiscal experience,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, I had a lot of experience dealing with people.\u201d He also runs the Sanford and Son Antiques shop in Wyalusing but recently quit his job as jury manager for now-retired Judge Kenneth Seamans to run for office.\n\nIf elected, Mr. Bullock said he would advocate for seniors, including pushing for an adult day care center and education efforts aimed at making elderly residents and their families aware of existing programs.\n\nHis interest stems from his experience caring for his aging mother for 14 years before her death in 1997. Her Parkinson\u2019s disease advanced to the point where he had to feed, bathe and carry her.\n\nMs. Arnold is proud of her entrepreneurial experience. She is a licensed barber and holds her real estate licenses in Pennsylvania and New York.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019ve done the real estate, because I\u2019ve done the barbering, a lot of people know me,\u201d she said.\n\nMore recently, she worked at a local office of seismic permitting firm Cougar Land Services, which led to jobs as a permit agent, then land agent serving the natural gas industry.\n\nShe described herself as a \u201cstickler for customer service\u201d who joined the commissioners\u2019 race after people who knew her professionally suggested she run.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a caring person,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m running.\u201d\n\nMr. Hall was most proud of his work on the county\u2019s pension fund, funded at 43 percent when he took office and now fully funded, he said. He is seeking his second four-year term as commissioner.\n\nDuring his time, the county was able to use general fund money to pay down its debts, he said. Impact fees cannot be used to pay debt service. The county also accomplished major renovations on the courthouse, overhauling its heating and cooling systems, running fiber optic cables and upgrading computer systems, he said.\n\n\u201cThe idea behind this is that once we\u2019re done with all the upgrades, we want to go 20 to 30 years without major renovations or construction,\u201d Mr. Hall said.\n\nMr. Hall attributed their successes to a \u201csmart use of liquid assets and finances to ensure the safety and longevity of the county.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren said it was \u201cteamwork\u201d and the ability to put Act 13 money to some expenditures while investing general fund money in the right things.\n\nBoth also touted initiatives on suicide prevention and tick-borne diseases, as well as an upcoming $1.3 million affordable housing project in New Milford, following a three-year housing study.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty excited about that,\u201d said Ms. Warren, who is running for her fourth term. \u201cThat was a goal of people for years to get seniors out of houses they can\u2019t afford.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren took credit for making the initial call to Binghamton-based Leatherstocking Gas Co. that brought natural gas service to the county. She expressed excitement about an industrial park study on the Interstate 81 corridor that finished this year, potentially paving the way for manufacturing companies to build on the gas industry.\n\n\u201cManufacturing is a big deal in Susquehanna County, it\u2019s the background of a lot of people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to get large employers.\u201d\n\nMajor contested Susquehanna County races\n\nREGISTER OF WILLS, RECORDER OF DEEDS AND CLERK OF THE ORPHAN\u2019S COURT\n\nFour-year term, vote for one\n\nDemocrat: Tom Charles, Dimock Twp.\n\nRepublican: Michelle Estabrook, Great Bend Twp.\n\nCOUNTY AUDITOR\n\nFour-year term, vote for not more than two\n\nDemocrat: Susan M.
