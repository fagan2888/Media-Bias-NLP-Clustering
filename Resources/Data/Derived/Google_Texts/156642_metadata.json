( April Dembosky/KQED )\n\nHundreds of people with developmental disabilities marched in seven cities throughout California Thursday, carrying signs reading \u201cSave Our Programs\u201d and \u201cKeep Your Promise.\u201d They say their services are on the brink of collapse and are asking state lawmakers to increase funding by 10 percent.\n\nWorkers who care for people with disabilities including autism, down syndrome, and cerebral palsy say they earn less than employees at Burger King and McDonalds.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for flipping burgers,\u201d says Tim Hornbecker, business director at The Arc of Alameda County, a service provider. \u201cWe have people who literally turn people over. They transfer people from their wheelchair to bed at night. And they get minimum wage of $9.50.\u201d\n\nProtestors say provider rates haven\u2019t budged for a decade, at the same time the costs of providing supportive care and job training programs have gone up. Multiple pleas to the governor to increase funding have not resulted in any rate increases in the state budget.\n\nSo people took to the streets in San Diego, Bakersfield, Redding, and other cities.\n\nAndrew Silliman marched in Berkeley to rally support for a job training program he attends at ToolWorks for people with developmental disabilities.\n\n\u201cI want to work at Applebee\u2019s,\u201d he says. \u201cI want to do dessert, cook eggs, do your dishes. Everything. It\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\nBut advocates are worried that if the state doesn\u2019t increase funding for the program for programs like Silliman\u2019s job training program, they might close. Several day programs and job-training sites have been shuttered already in recent years, Hornbecker says, adding that his agency loses $200,000 a year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running on reserves. We\u2019re liquidating property,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s no way to run a business. And, we can\u2019t pay people a living wage.\u201d\n\nWhile the state has passed laws to increase the minimum wage and offer paid sick leave, adding to agencies\u2019 labor costs, Hornbecker says they haven\u2019t gotten any extra funds to comply with these mandates. Many agencies have simply cut hours, and that\u2019s forced a lot of workers to move on.\n\n\u201cThe turnover rate is so high, by the time folks get trained they leave for a better job,\u201d says Paul King, whose son receives supportive services so he can live independently. \u201cThe turnover rate is destroying these wonderful programs.\u201d\n\nJerry Brown called for a special legislative session on health care financing this summer, in part, to come up with new revenue streams to support services for people who are developmentally disabled. Lawmakers have proposed taxes on alcoholic beverages and health plans to raise money for the services, but so far, those proposals are floundering.\n\n\u201cDemocrats and Republicans agree that these are good services,\u201d says Assemblymember Tony Thurmond, D-Richmond. \u201cNot everyone agrees we need to create taxes to support it.\u201d\n\nHe says he will continue proposing solutions when meetings of the special session resume in January. Thurmond says even these taxes will be cheaper than the alternative.\n\n\u201cI would hate to see people going into institutional care, which is more restrictive and more expensive,\u201d he says.\n\nCalifornia is seen as a leader in providing community-based services that allow people with developmental disabilities to live on their own or with their families. These services were established in 1969, under the Lanterman Act, and are paid for by the state. There are no income thresholds for families.\n\nShira Leeder wants to make sure those rights are preserved. She has cerebral palsy and was at the Berkeley protest in her wheelchair. Without the funding increase, she says, she could end up living in an institution.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what we want. We want to be here,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd we want to have a life, like everybody else.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The action was part of a series of statewide protests.
