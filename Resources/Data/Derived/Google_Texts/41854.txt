PHILADELPHIA (CBS) — This is the final week to get health insurance coverage for 2016 through the Affordable Care Act.

This is the end of the third open enrollment, and each one has attracted more people. By mid-January, 415 thousand Pennsylvanians had signed up, including 275-thousand in the Philadelphia area, but that still leaves hundreds of thousands uninsured. Neil Deegan, the state director of Enroll America, wants people to know, the enrollment process has gotten steadily easier and lots of help is available.

“There are hundreds and hundreds of appointments for enrollment help available,” Deegan said.

There are sign-up events at Methodist Hospital, Montgomery County Community College, and four PGW offices. For residents in Philadelphia, they can find other spots in the city by calling 3-1-1.

“We know a lot of folks wait until the last-minute and the last-minute has arrived,” Deegan said.

The deadline is Sunday, at midnight.
