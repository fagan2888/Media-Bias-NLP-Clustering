Please help our response by staying home and off roads/scenes. \u2014 Judge Clay Jenkins (@JudgeClayJ) December 27, 2015\n\nUpdated at 11:55 p.m.: Revised to include information on Glenn Heights. Rescue workers were scrambling Saturday night to offer help to families displaced after at least three tornadoes swept across North Texas. Glenn Heights was without power and declared in a state of emergency Saturday night after more than 100 homes were damaged in the city. The community also remained under curfew until 7 a.m. Sunday while workers assessed the damage, cleared debris and fixed power and gas lines, said Millicent West, Glenn Heights emergency management specialist. As many as 75 homes were heavily damaged or completely destroyed and another 75 were damaged. The Ovilla Road Church of the Nazarene was destroyed as well. All of the damage was contained in a 2-mile stretch along Hampton Road near Ovilla Road, West said. But, she said, no one was seriously injured. The storm continued north into DeSoto. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins has signed a local disaster declaration in the wake of the tornadoes that claimed at least eight lives by 11 p.m. Saturday. Most of the storms were localized to the eastern edges of Ellis, Collin and Dallas counties. \u201cTonight was obviously a destructive night and a deadly night,\u201d said American Red Cross spokeswoman Anita Foster. \u201cWhen we lose people in disasters it really does bring home the gravity of what nature can do in a community.\u201d City and county officials are still sorting through the damage, and there were no firm numbers of how many homes were damaged in the storms. Foster said Red Cross volunteers have been fanning out across the area to figure out where they are most needed. At least six Dallas police officers were among those who lost homes and vehicles in Rockwall and Ellis counties, said Sr. Cpl. Frederick Frazier, first Vice President of Dallas Police Association. He said the Assist the Officer Foundation will provide help for the officers. Go to atodallas.org. Donations can be made at RedCross.org or by texting Red Cross to 90999 to give $10. In the wake of the storms, authorities have been warning people to stay inside. Dallas city officials have been reiterating \u201cturn around, don\u2019t drown\u201d after the National Weather Service issued flash flood watches and warnings. Steady rainfall is expected Sunday. Collin County officials also urged people to stay away from the worst disaster areas in Copeville.\n\nTEXAS: As storms cross our state please heed warnings of local officials & stay safe. #txlege \u2014 Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) December 27, 2015\n\nComplete coverage of the storm\u2019s devastation\n\n\u2018Total devastation\u2019: Residents, emergency crews work frantically after tornadoes\n\nTornado in Rowlett classified as EF3; 11 confirmed dead in storms in Garland, Collin County\n\nOfficials identify six of eight tornado victims who died in Garland\n\nStorm damages over 100 buildings in Glenn Heights\n\nFloyd: Weather\u2019s tragic capriciousness is still beyond our control\n\nNBC5: Staff shortage left NWS scrambling to cover tornado outbreak\n\nColliding weather systems caused tornado outbreak\n\nGov.
