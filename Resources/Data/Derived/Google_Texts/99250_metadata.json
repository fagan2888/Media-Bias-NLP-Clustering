Hladik was 74 when the day anticipated by his doctors arrived: His kidneys, damaged years earlier by a viral infection, had lost 85 percent of their function.\n\nTime to begin dialysis.\n\nBut from the beginning, Hladik resisted. An IBM retiree, he loved fishing, boating and gardening \u2014 and hated hospitals.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to be at home with his dog. He wanted to be able to go to the beach,\u201d recalled his son, Dr. Gerald A. Hladik.\n\nA nephrologist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Gerald A. Hladik understood better than most how kidney dialysis could consume a patient\u2019s days. His father\u2019s eventful medical history included a serious stroke and coronary bypass surgery.\n\n\u201cDialysis may have prolonged his life, but I suspect only by a couple of months,\u201d Hladik said.\n\nSo after considerable discussion, the elder Hladik decided to skip the three weekly trips to a renal center. His doctors managed his heart disease and hypertension with drugs. He died at home in November, a year and a half after saying no to dialysis.\n\nPeople over age 75 are the fastest-growing segment of patients on dialysis, and the treatment\u2019s benefits and drawbacks add up differently for them than for younger patients. A growing number of nephrologists and researchers are pushing for more educated and deliberative decision-making when seniors contemplate dialysis.\n\nIt is a choice, they say, not an imperative.\n\n\u201cPatients are not adequately informed about the burdens. All they\u2019re told is, \u2018You have to go on dialysis or you\u2019ll die,\u2019 \u201d said Dr. Alvin H. Moss, a nephrologist at West Virginia University School of Medicine and chairman of the Coalition for Supportive Care of Kidney Patients. \u201cNobody tells them, \u2018You could have up to two years without the treatment, without the discomfort, with greater independence.\u2019 \u201d Dialysis involves filtering impurities from the blood when a patient\u2019s kidneys can no longer do so.\n\nUnquestionably, dialysis has helped save lives. The mortality rate for patients with chronic kidney disease decreased 42 percent from 1995 to 2012, according to the most recent report from the U.S. Renal Data System.\n\nThe picture for older patients is less rosy. About 40 percent of patients over age 75 with end-stage renal disease, or advanced kidney failure, die within a year, and only 19 percent survive beyond four years, the renal data system has reported. A primary reason is that older patients like Hladik generally suffer from other chronic conditions.\n\n\u201cDialysis only treats the kidney disease,\u201d said Dr. Ann O\u2019Hare, a nephrologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t treat the other problems an older person may have. It may even make them more challenging to deal with.\u201d\n\nTypical hemodialysis sessions take place three times a week, and each lasts three to four hours \u2014 a regimen O\u2019Hare compares to holding down a part-time job. Afterward, \u201cpatients may have cramping. They can feel dizzy, washed out,\u201d Moss said. Many report pain or nausea.\n\n\u201cA typical older dialysis patient will say, \u2018I just go home afterwards and go to bed,\u2019 \u201d Moss said. After the good day that usually follows, the cycle repeats.\n\nMore conservative approaches to kidney disease do exist and can improve older patients\u2019 quality of life. Medication to control blood pressure, treat anemia, and reduce swelling and pain, \u201cthese are treatments that will keep people comfortable for long periods,\u201d Moss said. \u201cPeople choosing medical management could live 12 to 18 months, 23 months.\u201d\n\nAnd spend less of that time in medical facilities.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/05/hfaging26.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdff91\"", "article_summary": "More conservative approaches to kidney disease do exist and can improve older patients\u2019 quality of life.\nA primary reason is that older patients like Hladik generally suffer from other chronic conditions.\n\u201cA typical older dialysis patient will say, \u2018I just go home afterwards and go to bed,\u2019 \u201d Moss said.\nThe picture for older patients is less rosy.\nPeople over age 75 are the fastest-growing segment of patients on dialysis, and the treatment\u2019s benefits and drawbacks add up differently for them than for younger patients."}
