This applies to the 35 member counties of CMSP. They are largely rural counties. It\u2019s aimed at covering those that remain uninsured after the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange and Medi-Cal, low-income health insurance, are considered. Expansion includes several doctor visits and $1,000 in prescription drugs the Bee reports. It could begin in 2016.\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER\n\nMigration Policy Institute estimates 3 million illegally present foreign nationals in California alone.\n\nWhile this program operates outside of the health exchange, California is aggressively moving toward providing health insurance to foreign nationals illegally present in the state under the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange Covered California as well.\n\nGovernor Jerry Brown Wednesday signed California\u2019s budget including a provision to give an estimated 170,000 illegally present foreign national children Medi-Cal coverage at a cost of $130,000. This despite President Obama\u2019s 2009 lie as he promised before Congress that illegal aliens would not be able to enroll. It\u2019s reminiscent of another Obama lie, \u201cIf you like your healthcare plan, you\u2019ll be able to keep your healthcare plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have also introduced legislation in California, SB 4, that would provide a waiver allowing illegal aliens to enroll in state healthcare exchanges.\n\nMeanwhile Gov. Brown has declared illegal aliens are welcome in California and even went so far as to threateningly call it un-Christian to deny them amnesty.\n\nThe CMSP also approved bumping eligibility for both legal and illegal residnets, up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level according to the Bee. The federal poverty level for a single individual is just under $12,000 for 2015. Extra cost of the program will amount to approximately $6-9 million.\n\nThe CMSP, \u201chas responsibility for setting program eligibility standards, defining the scope of covered healthcare benefits, and determining payment rates for healthcare providers delivering emergency and non-emergency services to CMSP members,\u201d according to its own website. Advanced Medical Management serves as the CMSP\u2019s third party administrator.\n\nCMSP faced budget strain before Medi-Cal expansion and creation of Covered California. According to the Bee it now enjoys a cushy $225 million reserve.\n\nIllegal Alien advocate, Representative Luis Gutierrez wrapped up his nationwide amnesty tour at the University of Southern California and one other Los Angeles location in March. Following his speech a Q&A panel assured illegal aliens not covered under Obamacare, \u201cthere is insurance available for undocumented individuals and it does not have to be Obamacare.\u201d\n\nFollow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana", "article_metadata": {"description": "Illegal Alien Health Insurance Expanded in 35 California Counties", "og": {"site_name": "Breitbart", "description": "Illegal Alien Health Insurance Expanded in 35 California Counties", "title": "Illegal Alien Health Insurance Expanded in 35 California Counties - Breitbart", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 640, "identifier": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/no-human-is-illegal-sign-immigration-rally-Reuters.jpg", "height": 480}, "updated_time": "2015-06-26T15:21:22-07:00", "url": "http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2015/06/26/illegal-alien-health-insurance-expanded-in-35-california-counties/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Illegal Alien Health Insurance Expanded in 35 California Counties", "creator": "@michellediana", "image": "http://media.breitbart.com/media/2014/12/no-human-is-illegal-sign-immigration-rally-Reuters.jpg", "title": "Illegal Alien Health Insurance Expanded in 35 California Counties - Breitbart", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "card": "summary"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 1243316582352556, "pages": 95475020353, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/t/assets/i/w-logo-orange.png", "keywords": "budget, County Medical Services Program, Covered California, health exchange, health insurance, healthcare, illegal alien, Jerry Brown, obamacare, SB 4, undocumented immigrant,Big Government, Breitbart California, Immigration,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart", "published_time": "2015-06-26T15:21:00-07:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/michdimoo", "section": "Big Government", "modified_time": "2015-06-26T15:21:22-07:00", "tag": "undocumented immigrant", "categories": "Big Government,Breitbart California,Immigration"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "op": {"markup_version": "v1.0"}}, "article_summary": "This despite President Obama\u2019s 2009 lie as he promised before Congress that illegal aliens would not be able to enroll.\nUnder the CMSP decision, those illegal aliens, mostly identified as adults by the Sacramento Bee, would be provided health coverage.\nBrown has declared illegal aliens are welcome in California and even went so far as to threateningly call it un-Christian to deny them amnesty.\nWhile this program operates outside of the health exchange, California is aggressively moving toward providing health insurance to foreign nationals illegally present in the state under the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange Covered California as well.\nIt\u2019s aimed at covering those that remain uninsured after the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange and Medi-Cal, low-income health insurance, are considered."}
