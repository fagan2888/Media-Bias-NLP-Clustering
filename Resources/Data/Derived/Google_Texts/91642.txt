GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — For the first time this tax season reporting health coverage is a requirement on a tax return.

The change is due to the Affordable Care Act which requires everyone to have health insurance.

For people who had health insurance last year, such as through work, they’ll only have to check a box.

But for those who weren’t covered or signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, it’s a little more complicated and could possible cost them.

While signing up for the Affordable Care Act, people were required to give an estimate of their income. They were then given a price for their healthcare coverage based on that estimate. When filing for a tax return, if the person actually made more than expected in 2014 they will have to pay extra for some of that healthcare coverage.

People who didn’t sign up for healthcare coverage will have to pay a tax penalty — the minimum for one person is $95 or a percentage of their income, whichever is higher.

Bigger penalties are expected for people who don’t get healthcare coverage in 2015.

“This year’s penalties might not seem real large but those penalties will grow next year, it’ll be higher the year after that, it’ll be higher again,” said Duane Culver of Culver CPA Group.

Culver said tax preparers and CPAs have been training and preparing for the added paperwork this year. He suggests coming in early to get taxes done and not waiting until the last minute.
