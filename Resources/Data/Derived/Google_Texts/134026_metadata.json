An asterisk at the bottom of the Oasis Caf\u00e9\u2019s receipts explained: \u201c*MIN WAGE FEE is a charge to offset a state increase of minimum wage for tipped employees.\u201d Naturally, outrage ensued, and the restaurant\u2019s Facebook page became locked in Manichaean battle between supporters of the restaurant and defenders of the common working American.\n\nInstead of conspicuously posting that separate surcharge, the Oasis Caf\u00e9 probably could have saved itself a lot of aggravation and vengeful one-star Yelp reviews by merely folding any added labor costs into the prices of its menu items. No matter how innocent it was, or whether they merely wanted to be honest and upfront about things, many people took it as a mealy-mouthed protest that nickel-and-dimes their customers and spits on their hardworking staff.\n\nHowever, the Oasis Caf\u00e9 is not alone in passing the buck, or fraction thereof, in response to wage increases \u2014 which, in Minnesota\u2019s case, is a mere $8 as of Aug. 1. The city of SeaTac, Washington, which largely exists to service the airport that shares its name, enacted a $15 minimum wage earlier this year. Although full of exemptions at the outset, the fair-wage ordinance spurred one long-term parking garage to tack on a daily $.99 \u201cliving wage surcharge\u201d that comes in addition to a $2.50 \u201cairport access fee.\u201d Park your car for a week\u2019s vacation, and that $6.93 is quite a bit more than a 35 cent fee for dinner, although the outcry was comparatively muted.\n\nMinimum wage increases aren\u2019t the only inspiration for sticking consumers with the bill. For years, San Francisco restaurants have tacked small fees (usually $3 or $4) onto the total tab to pay into a city healthcare fund for uninsured food-service workers. Overall, the policy earned grudging respect in a progressive, food-obsessed city with a history of standing up for labor \u2014 until it was revealed that several restaurants weren\u2019t paying into the healthcare fund at all, but pocketing the money. Worse, a Los Angeles restaurant-bakery defended its 3 percent healthcare surcharge by directing any miffed customers to deduct the equivalent amount from the tip.\n\nIn the aggregate, this points to a trend whereby businesses protest progressive policy that might eat into their profits by nickel-and-diming their customers, and then, upon being called out, claim their backs were against the wall. It could get uglier, too. Assuming the U.S. ever gets serious about carbon taxes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, might we see gas stations decouple those taxes from the price of the gasoline itself, and hit drivers with the full amount owed only after they\u2019ve put the pump back in the holster? (I do hope I haven\u2019t given Exxon an idea.)\n\nThe practice isn\u2019t just making restaurant tabs more unpleasant and invoice-like, either. Inscrutable fees have made phone bills so opaque that T-Mobile was able to make millions in kickbacks from third parties who cram those bills with dubious charges, thereby profiting off its users\u2019 confusion and passivity. And it worked. Major corporations will probably be savvier than a mom-and-pop diner, but the strategy is the same: when a progressive policy wins, consumers must lose. Maybe an ensuing public outcry will lead to the policy\u2019s repeal, maybe it will throw cold water on further proposals, or maybe the company can just defray some of the costs. Every scenario is a win.\n\nLet\u2019s not dwell too long on the grotesque phrase \u201cliving wage surcharge,\u201d or the implication that it\u2019s somehow punitive for a business to keep its employees alive. But as Seattle gets acclimated to its $10.10 wage and mulls over the possibility of a $15 threshold (with a likely exemption for small businesses), the sky isn\u2019t entirely caving in. Craig Jelinek, CEO of Costco, told Seattle Weekly that \u201c$15 seems not even a living wage\u201d and that \u201cWe at Costco could manage it.\u201d That\u2019s a far cry from the apocalyptic drumbeat emanating from the Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial page, for whom the prospect of a minimum wage increase sounds like a gamma-ray burst shearing through the solar system to extinguish life on this planet. They\u2019d prefer literally any other policy, even an expansion of the dreaded welfare state.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Minimum wage hikes are a great idea.
