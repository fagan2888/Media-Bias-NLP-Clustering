It turns out that for Francis, casting the moneychangers out of the Temple has proven to be a time-consuming task.\n\nLast summer, a number of senior officials with the Vatican Bank resigned around the time that one of its senior accountants, Monsignor Nunzio Scarano, was arrested and charged with conspiring to smuggle more than $20 million from Italy to Switzerland. Scarano, reportedly known in Rome as \u201cMonsignor 500\u201d for his habit of displaying a wallet full of \u20ac500 notes, has since been charged with multiple other offenses, including money laundering.\n\nIn January, Francis fired four out of the five cardinals on the commission overseeing the bank, known as the Institute for Works of Religion, or IOR in its Italian acronym. Supposed to serve only priests, nuns, and religious orders, the Vatican Bank has been implicated in money laundering schemes and other illegal activity. Francis made it clear that he was open to closing down the bank completely.\n\nIn February, by Papal edict, he laid out multiple new transparency requirements for the Vatican\u2019s financial arm, and created a new Secretariat for the Economy, meant to act as an auditor general for the Vatican. The following month, he indicated that the Vatican Bank would survive, though in a vastly different form, as a large number of accounts not related to its central mission were shut down.\n\nRelated: For Pope Francis, Religious Visit Quickly Turns Political\n\nThe edict, though, has not cleaned out all of the old guard who have made the Vatican\u2019s financial system a laughingstock among law enforcement professionals and a haven for criminals.\n\nLast week\u2019s announcement came after Swiss money laundering expert Ren\u00e9 Br\u00fclhart, who was named to head the Financial Information Authority, complained that he was being obstructed by the board \u2013 made up of five Italians with connections to the Vatican\u2019s old guard.\n\nIn years past, it might have been Br\u00fclhart, at one point the head of Liechtenstein\u2019s respected Financial Intelligence Unit, who found himself out on the street.\n\nTo Francis\u2019s credit, there is a new board on its way in oversee the Vatican\u2019s financial watchdog Its makeup is remarkable only because of its international nature: it\u2019s made up of four international experts, including former financial regulators \u2013 one from the U.S., one from Switzerland, one from Singapore and a fourth from Italy. It is also notable that the Italian member is a woman, insurance executive Maria Bianca Farina, making her one of the few women with significant authority in the Vatican.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Casting the moneychangers out of the temple has proven a more complicated task than Pope Francis perhaps expected.", "title": "Pope Francis Fires His Bankers\u2026Again", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/09/Pope-Francis-Fires-His-Bankers-Again", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06092014_Pope_Fired.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/06/09/Pope-Francis-Fires-His-Bankers-Again", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/06092014_Pope_Fired.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Casting the moneychangers out of the temple has proven a more complicated task than Pope Francis perhaps expected.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1f17\"", "article_summary": "Related: Pope Francis Slams Capitalism and Growing InequalityThe announcement on Thursday was only the most recent in a series of firings, replacements, and arrests that have rocked the Vatican\u2019s financial hierarchy.\nRelated: For Pope Francis, Religious Visit Quickly Turns PoliticalThe edict, though, has not cleaned out all of the old guard who have made the Vatican\u2019s financial system a laughingstock among law enforcement professionals and a haven for criminals.\nSupposed to serve only priests, nuns, and religious orders, the Vatican Bank has been implicated in money laundering schemes and other illegal activity.\nIt turns out that for Francis, casting the moneychangers out of the Temple has proven to be a time-consuming task.\nThe following month, he indicated that the Vatican Bank would survive, though in a vastly different form, as a large number of accounts not related to its central mission were shut down."}
