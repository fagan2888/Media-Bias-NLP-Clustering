Unfortunately, too many mothers-to-be are not aware that, along with chemicals, certain foods, and some beverages, they also need to avoid radiation from phones, wireless routers, and laptop computers in order to safeguard their babies.\n\n\u201cThe science is compelling and growing and women have an absolute right to know about it in order to make an informed decision,\u201d said Patricia Wood, executive director of Grassroots Environmental Education, in her opening remarks during the BabySafe News Conference on Tuesday. BabySafe is a national campaign to raise awareness about an issue too few pregnant women understand: that their exposure to wireless radiation may interfere with their child's brain development, resulting in behavioral problems, including symptoms resembling ADHD. Though the BabySafe program is new \u2014 with an online quiz to help mothers understand exposure levels \u2014 it echoes an old theme familiar to pregnant women worldwide: better safe than sorry.\n\nHyperactive Symptoms\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t keep your phone on you at all times,\u201d advised Dr. Hugh Taylor of Yale University School of Medicine. \u201cMove it away from you. Keep exposure to a minimum.\u201d Taylor, who is chair of the department of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences, is author of a study on pregnancy, cell phone radiation, and behavioral changes in mice, published in Scientific Reports. Because it is so difficult to trace a specific environmental influence on a developing fetus \u2014 mothers are exposed to many potential influences so it is difficult to determine the exact effects of just one \u2014 he and his colleagues designed a special animal study in order to isolate cell phone use and study its effects on babies before they were born.\n\nThe experiment worked like this: Taylor and his team of researchers exposed one group of 42 pregnant mice to a muted and silenced phone that had been turned on and was actively receiving a signal, and, to compare, they also exposed a second group of 42 pregnant mice to a cell phone that was turned off and not receiving a signal. Otherwise, all environmental conditions, including food and accommodation, were identical. The pregnant mice were exposed throughout their entire pregnancies and then their offspring were tested when adults.\n\nWhat did Taylor and his colleagues observe? Compared to the mice who had not been exposed to cell phone radiation, the exposed mice had decreased memory, more likely to be hyper active, and, in Taylor\u2019s words, \u201cdidn\u2019t have a care in the world. They were very different from the mice who had not been exposed.\u201d He likened their behavior to that of children with attention deficit hyper-activity disorder (ADHD or ADD), which is a common and increasing diagnosis for young children. In fact, the exposed mice had different electrical activity in their brains.\n\nOn the positive side, Taylor said very short exposures were similar to no exposure, and the change in brain activity generally increased with higher levels of exposure. In other words, by limiting her own exposure to radiation, a mother might effectively protect her unborn child.\n\nOut-of-Date Standards\n\n\u201cCell phones have never been tested for safety,\u201d said Dr. Devra Davis, UC Berkeley and the author of Disconnect, which explores the issue of radiation exposure. She explained that though scientists performed limited investigations into safety when cell phones first came into popular use, the standards were established 18 years ago. She also noted that cell phones had never been tested in realistic ways, mimicking the habits of most people. No one has assessed safety, for instance, when a cell phone is held directly against the ear or carried in the breast pocket. Standards, then, are not only dated but also inaccurate.\n\n\u201cAs someone who has been working in the field of public health\u2026 I\u2019ve seen how America discusses issues of public health and safety,\u201d Davis said. Generally, she explained, we insist on proof of human harm and human damage before we act and in the end \u201cpeople pay the price for those delays.\u201d Along with echoing Taylor\u2019s advice, she suggested women avoid cordless phones, especially where they sleep.\n\n\u201cEleven percent of children carry a diagnosis of ADHD,\u201d said Dr. Maya Shetreat-Klein, integrative pediatric neurologist and founder of Brainmending. She added that currently, one out of every five children has been diagnosed with a mental illness. In her own practice, she finds the most common question she is asked by parents is: Why? Why is my child affected? Though Shetreat-Klein can give no real answer to parents \u2014 disorders are complex and can\u2019t be explained by a single factor \u2014 growing scientific evidence supports the conclusion that in utero exposure is linked to behavioral problems in children.\n\n\u201cParents have a right to know,\u201d she said before advising pregnant women to turn off their phones and WiFi at night or whenever it\u2019s not needed.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "radiation, cell phone, pregnancy, in utero development, prenatal development, babies, pediatrics, adhd, behavior", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Exposure to wireless radiation may interfere with an unborn child's brain development, resulting in behavioral problems resembling ADHD.", "title": "Your Cell Phone Could Be Stunting Your Baby's Brain [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/radiation-cell-phones-and-wireless-devices-harms-your-unborn-babys-brain-development-286170", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/cell-phones-and-pregnancy.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Exposure to wireless radiation may interfere with an unborn child's brain development, resulting in behavioral problems resembling ADHD.", "title": "Your Cell Phone Could Be Stunting Your Baby's Brain [VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/radiation-cell-phones-and-wireless-devices-harms-your-unborn-babys-brain-development-286170", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/cell-phones-and-pregnancy.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/06/03/cell-phones-and-pregnancy.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Consumer News", "published_time": "2014-06-03T13:19:14-04:00", "modified_time": "2014-06-03T13:19:13-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Exposure to wireless radiation may interfere with an unborn child's brain development, resulting in behavioral problems resembling ADHD."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd034b\"", "article_summary": "She also noted that cell phones had never been tested in realistic ways, mimicking the habits of most people.\nShe explained that though scientists performed limited investigations into safety when cell phones first came into popular use, the standards were established 18 years ago.\nNo one has assessed safety, for instance, when a cell phone is held directly against the ear or carried in the breast pocket.\nThe pregnant mice were exposed throughout their entire pregnancies and then their offspring were tested when adults.\nIn fact, the exposed mice had different electrical activity in their brains."}
