The midterm elections were a rejection of the president, his party, and his agenda -- and non-voters are on board with that repudiation:\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican voters give Obama a negative 39 - 54 percent approval rating, close to his lowest-ever 38 - 57 percent score in a December 10, 2013, Quinnipiac University poll. Democrats and voters under 30 years old are the only party, gender or age groups who approve of the president. Only 42 percent of American voters trust Obama more than Republicans in Congress to do what is best for the nation, while 47 percent trust Republicans more. It's good for the country that Republicans have taken over control of the U.S. Senate, voters say 51 - 37 percent, but 67 percent of voters expect more gridlock in the next two years. Gridlock will be Obama's fault, 44 percent of voters say, as 42 percent would blame Republicans. \"American voters are happy the Republicans have the ball, but don't feel confident there will be a lot of scoring on the deal-making front,\" Malloy said. \"If that's the case, the numbers say blame will fall on Obama as much as Republicans.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Dissatisfaction..05/25/2016 20:24:26PM EST.", "author": "Guy Benson", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Dissatisfaction.", "title": "- Q-Poll: Obama Approval Back to 39 Percent, Americans Trust GOP More", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2014/11/26/qpoll-obama-approval-back-to-39-percent-americans-trust-gop-more-n1924264", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/329/6bb33da9-a1c2-453a-abc9-cc4c761e7ce7.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Dissatisfaction.", "title": "- Q-Poll: Obama Approval Back to 39 Percent, Americans Trust GOP More", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2014/11/26/qpoll-obama-approval-back-to-39-percent-americans-trust-gop-more-n1924264", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2014/329/6bb33da9-a1c2-453a-abc9-cc4c761e7ce7.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Q-Poll: Obama Approval Back to 39 Percent, Americans Trust GOP More, Guy Benson, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf43a\"", "article_summary": "Only 42 percent of American voters trust Obama more than Republicans in Congress to do what is best for the nation, while 47 percent trust Republicans more.\n\"If that's the case, the numbers say blame will fall on Obama as much as Republicans.\nGridlock will be Obama's fault, 44 percent of voters say, as 42 percent would blame Republicans.\nWhy don't you go ahead and consider Quinnipiac's latest numbers a continuation of these data points we highlighted last week.\nDemocrats and voters under 30 years old are the only party, gender or age groups who approve of the president."}
