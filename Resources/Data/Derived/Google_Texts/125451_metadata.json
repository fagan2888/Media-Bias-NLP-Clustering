The RFRA, said the original text, sought to give judicial succor to those who found that their \u201cexercise of religion . . . has been substantially burdened,\u201d or was just \u201clikely to be substantially burdened\u201d by performing services for people their faith\u2019s sacred credos enjoin them to abhor (gays, in this case). The ensuing uproar in the media and business circles compelled Indiana\u2019s state Senate to amend the legislation to prevent its deployment against the LBGT community, but state Democrats are still calling for its repeal.\n\nThe danger, however, has by no means passed. RFRAs already exist in 21 other states (in three of which, bills are pending to fortify them), and three more are considering adopting similar measures. The RFRA just passed last week in Arkansas may allow faith-based discrimination; we now await a test case.\n\nYet the real menace to our priceless heritage of secular governance comes from the Supreme Court, which a year ago (in Sebelius v. Hobby Lobby) ruled that corporations, on the basis of their religious convictions (yes, the Court decided corporations have those), can exempt themselves from the Affordable Care Act\u2019s relevant articles and refuse to pay for contraceptives in their employee health plans. (Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in her dissent, warned that this was a \u201cdecision of startling breadth,\u201d and she was right.) If a case involving a new manifestation of such legislation (say, the Arkansan RFRA) ever lands before the nine-member Roberts Court, its five conservative justices will no doubt adjudicate in favor of the faithful \u2013 and against rationalists who hold that religion, in no shape or form, should be allowed to infect our legal system. What is really needed is a federal LGBT shield law, but none exists.\n\nRFRAs don\u2019t define religion or specify to which religion they pertain. But a lot hinges on how we define religion. Everyone knows what dictionaries say it is. We\u2019re also all too familiar with another definition, one by which faith is an entirely spiritual affair, a matter of transcendental, miraculously elastic interpretation never to be held accountable for the witless antics, casual brutality and gross atrocities committed by its practitioners. (Reza Aslan is the most prominent advocate of this view.) Both definitions lend an aura of dignity and gravitas to what is essentially sordid gibberish that we should dismiss out of hand, as we now do necromancy, phrenology or alchemy, or simply laugh off.\n\nYet religion is far too dangerous to our liberties to be laughed off or mischaracterized as harmless. In its Abrahamic strain, it is a triad of antiquated, largely pernicious ideologies of control and exclusion suffusing various \u201choly\u201d books that detail a phony cosmogony, a fairy-tale version of humankind\u2019s origins, and a plethora of strictures meant to regulate and restrict our behavior. This \u201csacred\u201d canon glorifies the (frequently) vile misdeeds and plodding pontifications of a wide range of characters, among whom occur prophets and patriarchs (some of whom are felonious, even murderous, miscreants) and their hapless victims (mostly women, girls, infants, foreigners, and \u201cunbelievers\u201d). A fictitious celestial tyrant superintends the almost ceaseless slaughter playing out in the Bronze-Age phantasmagoria of his alleged creation. He periodically issues injunctions to his wayward subjects, and punishes them cruelly when they fail to obey (or just for the heck of it, as one righteous resident of the Land of Uz discovers). Though these ideologies purport to embrace humanity as a whole, the phantasmagoria\u2019s action takes place in a dusty, too-hot corner of the Mediterranean, parts of which once had the honor of hosting the Greeks and their Hellenic culture, the Romans with their laws and roads, and of course the haunting civilization of ancient Egypt.\n\nHow do today\u2019s subjects of this fictitious tyrant know what his commands are? The supposedly infallible despot made the mistake of issuing his rule books in ancient tongues that most (including a majority of Hoosiers and Arkansans, we can safely say) cannot read in the original. This compels his subjects to muddle along with translations, which vary considerably, at times critically and confusingly. Nevertheless, most of his subjects profess to understand his words with exactitude, and accord them incantatory, magic powers. In times of distress and duress, they utter their magic words, heads bowed meekly or turned imploringly heavenward, hoping to conjure up the fictitious tyrant\u2019s goodwill, or prompt him to grant special dispensation.\n\nHis pronouncements are regarded as binding on all humans. Hence, if the fictitious tyrant says, for instance, that gay sex is an abomination, it just is, and gays have to be abominated, like it or not. Nothing personal \u2013 it\u2019s just what the magic book says.\n\nTrue devotees of these magic books see no need to think for themselves, because their books, being magic, have answers for literally everything. Sort of like a single pill that could cure every disease on earth, from the common cold to brain cancer, from chicken pox to the bubonic plague. Strangely enough, though, unknown humans came up with these magic books in a time before people knew what germs were, what gravity was, or that the earth orbited the sun, or that the earth was round. But the magic books, because they are magic, have to be believed. Why? Because the magic books say so.\n\nFailure to believe in said magic books is a great sin. Why? So the magic books themselves decree. According to one of the magic books, those who announce they\u2019ve stopped believing in it deserve to die. Hoosiers who believe in their particular magic book can\u2019t issue death sentences of that sort (yet), but the original version of their RFRA would have allowed them to mistreat anyone their fictitious tyrant doesn\u2019t like, in accordance with what\u2019s written in their magic book, and with the backing of courts of law. Talking about \u201cmagic books\u201d and \u201ccourts of law\u201d in the same breath seems strange, because it is strange. Which of the two phrases doesn\u2019t befit our day and age?\n\nIf RFRAs are passed that permit entrepreneurs to discriminate against LBGT people, what would this look like? This is worth imagining, at least as long as there\u2019s no federal LBGT shield law. So, a couple consisting of two award-winning, well-mannered gay molecular biologists arrive at a restaurant in the South or the Midwest. They are to deliver lectures of momentous scientific import at a local university, but they are told to get up and clear out by a restaurateur ranting about what\u2019s in his magic book. If they sue him, he could, in court, avail himself of protection afforded by his state\u2019s RFRA and cite the verse from his magic book as his justification.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Draw the line from Hobby Lobby to Indiana: Religion has dangerously infected our legal system.
