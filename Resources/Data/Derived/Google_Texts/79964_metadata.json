And while that is an extreme example of falling apart, it only highlighted the team\u2019s dismal third quarters during their losing streak.\n\n\u201cGolden State, good start. Clippers, good start. San Antonio (on Friday night), good start. (Saturday night), good start,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said. \u201cBut it\u2019s all about our inability to sustain that. We had a lot of guys play well in the first half that in the second half we didn\u2019t get anything from. And that can\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nDuring the six-game losing streak, the Nuggets are averaging 53 points and 12.0 assists in the first half. They are shooting 47 percent from the field, including 40 percent from 3-point range, and are committing 7.2 turnovers.\n\nAnd then comes the fall.\n\nIn the second half over the past six games, the Nuggets are averaging 41.2 points and 8.3 assists. They are shooting 35 percent from the field, including 23 percent from 3-point range, and turnovers jump to 8.5.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been our (style) lately,\u201d Malone said. \u201cWe play great in stretches. Our challenge is to try to play for 48 minutes, and we\u2019ve been unable to do so lately.\u201d\n\nComing out of halftime with the same focus they had at tipoff has been a problem.\n\nIn the third quarter during their losing streak, the Nuggets average a pitiful 18.7 points in the third quarter on 31.2 percent shooting and are averaging 5.2 turnovers.\n\nWhile this is new problem for this coaching staff, which is in its first year, it\u2019s not a new problem. This issue and the shooting struggles were problems the previous two seasons.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to figure it out, to be honest with you,\u201d rookie guard Emmanuel Mudiay said. \u201cWe all hate losing, so, we\u2019ve just got to figure out what it is, honestly. I really can\u2019t give you a direct answer right now. We\u2019ve got to get stops.\u201d\n\nSaid veteran forward Danilo Gallinari: \u201cI don\u2019t know (why), but it is something that is happening every game, and we\u2019ve got to do something about it. We have very good stretches against every team that we\u2019ve been playing. But we\u2019ve got to find a way to do it for 48 minutes. I don\u2019t know how, but we\u2019ve got to find a way to do it, and I think we will.\u201d\n\nChristopher Dempsey: cdempsey@denverpost.com or @dempseypost\n\nDENVER AT MILWAUKEE 6 p.m. Monday, ALT; 104.3 FM\n\nSpotlight on Khris Middleton:\n\nThe 6-foot-8 swingman from Texas A&M had a breakout season in 2014-15 and was rewarded with a five-year contract worth $70 million. But he didn\u2019t look like a $14 million-per-year player this season, averaging just 13.5 points and shooting only 36.9 percent in his first 13 games. His performance has picked up, however. In a three-game stretch leading into Sunday at Charlotte, he averaged 17.3 points and shot 58.6 percent. He scored 19 points in the Bucks\u2019 87-82 loss to the Hornets.\n\nNOTEBOOK\n\nNuggets:\n\nStarting shooting guard Gary Harris is listed as doubtful. The former Michigan State star is recovering from a concussion. \u2026 The Nuggets have won five of their last eight games, and eight of their last 12, in Milwaukee. \u2026 Two years ago, the Nuggets brought a five-game losing streak to Milwaukee and posted a victory. The Nuggets bring a six-game losing streak into Monday\u2019s game.\n\nBucks:\n\nMonday\u2019s game is the second of a back-to-back set for Milwaukee, which missed 20 of its 28 attempts from 3-point range Sunday at Charlotte. \u2026 The Bucks have had a roller-coaster season, starting with three consecutive losses, then wins in five of their next seven, then losses in six of their next seven.\n\nChristopher Dempsey, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Nuggets shooting 12 percent worse in second halves during skid", "title": "Nuggets shooting 12 percent worse in second halves during skid", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/11/29/nuggets-shooting-12-percent-worse-in-second-halves-during-skid/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151129__BN20151130_Z00_BNSP30BKNNUGGETSp1.jpg", "height": 538}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20151129__BN20151130_Z00_BNSP30BKNNUGGETSp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-29T19:02:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-20T06:56:37+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "(Saturday night), good start,\u201d Nuggets coach Michael Malone said.\nAnd while that is an extreme example of falling apart, it only highlighted the team\u2019s dismal third quarters during their losing streak.\nClippers, good start.\nAnd that can\u2019t happen.\u201dDuring the six-game losing streak, the Nuggets are averaging 53 points and 12.0 assists in the first half.\n\u2026 Two years ago, the Nuggets brought a five-game losing streak to Milwaukee and posted a victory."}
