Nikki Haley made it clear during her GOP response to President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address in January that Donald Trump was not her cup of tea.\n\nTrump fumed after the Palmetto State Republican star \u2013 who won national acclaim for her compassionate response to the mass shootings at an historic black church in Charleston last year and for engineering the removal of the Confederate battle flag from the state capitol grounds \u2013 indirectly took the blustery billionaire to task for his hateful anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim stances.\n\nRelated: Trump Takes on Nikki Haley as Republicans Battle for Control\n\n\u201cDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices,\u201d said Haley, the first woman and the first Indian-American to be elected governor of South Carolina. \u201cWe must resist that temptation.\u201d\n\nHaley\u2019s opinion of Trump hasn\u2019t improved any since then, especially after she and her daughter sat through last Saturday night\u2019s GOP debate in Greenville, S.C., where Trump sought to further humiliate former Florida governor Jeb Bush by repeatedly denouncing former President George W. Bush\u2019s decision to invade Iraq after 9/11.\n\n\u201cI took my daughter to her first debate on Saturday, and I was embarrassed to see a candidate criticize a president on one of the worst days that we\u2019ve had in American history,\u201d Haley told reporters at the state capitol in Columbia. \u201cAnd criticize the way this president handled it. That was a sad day for America. And that was a tough time for our president. And to sit there and put him down in front of my daughter, I didn\u2019t know what to say to that. There were no words.\u201d\n\nThe two-term governor, one of the most popular Republicans in the state, has found those words to say. With barely three days to go before Saturday\u2019s South Carolina Republican primary, Haley will formally endorse Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida for president at a campaign event Wednesday evening.\n\nRelated: How One Tragic Event Could Change Nikki Haley\u2019s Political Future\n\nThe widely reported news of her decision provided a jolt of sort to the campaign, which has been most notable for relentless candidate sniping and bashing \u2013 mostly between Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the billionaire\u2019s closet rival.\n\nIf Haley was looking for a horse to ride to victory on Saturday, she chose the wrong candidate. Rubio has been struggling to recover from a poor debate performance just before the New Hampshire primary Feb. 9 and is trailing Trump and Cruz in the latest CNN/ORC poll of the South Carolina race. Rubio received the support of just 14 percent of likely Republican voter. By contrast, the high-flying Trump has the support of 38 percent of Republicans and Cruz has 22 percent. In almost every other poll, however, Rubio and Cruz are a virtual tie.\n\nTo his credit, Rubio has recovered from his debate stumble and has begun to regain his momentum with the help of high profile endorsements from prominent South Carolina Republicans, including Sen. Tim Scott, Rep. Trey Gowdy and now Haley.\n\nRelated: South Carolina\u2019s Confederate Flag Joins Museum Collection\n\nBut coming as it does with so little time remaining in the South Carolina campaign, Rubio\u2019s biggest hope is that he can catch up to \u2013 or even overtake \u2013 Cruz, who has been suffering a brutal political beating in recent weeks at the hands of Trump.\n\nAs for Haley, a one-time Tea Party acolyte who has blossomed into a prominent Republican establishment figure, she has taken a principled stand \u2013 even as she has been unceremoniously dropped by Trump and his supporters from any conceivable short list of vice presidential running mates for Trump \u2013 assuming he continues to roll towards the GOP nomination.\n\nThe Fiscal Times\u2019 Rob Garver contributed to this report", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "South Carolina Gov.", "title": "Nikki Haley Dumps Trump in Favor of Rubio in South Carolina Primary", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/17/Nikki-Haley-Dumps-Trump-Favor-Rubio-South-Carolina-Primary", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-haley_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/17/Nikki-Haley-Dumps-Trump-Favor-Rubio-South-Carolina-Primary", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/usa-haley_1.jpg", "title": "The Fiscal Times", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ericpianin"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "South Carolina Gov.", "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "South Carolina Gov.\nWith barely three days to go before Saturday\u2019s South Carolina Republican primary, Haley will formally endorse Sen.
