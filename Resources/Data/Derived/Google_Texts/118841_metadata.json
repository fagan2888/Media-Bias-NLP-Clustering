Beach, who is six feet, one inch tall, told the Associated Press Wednesday that he doesn\u2019t always use the device, but he needed to do some work on his computer during the flight. Beach also said he never reclines his own seat.\n\nAfter the woman seated in front of Beach figured out he had installed the Knee Defender, preventing her from reclining her own seat, the pair got involved in an altercation. Things got messy, with bad language and tossed beverages. The pilots ultimately diverted the flight to Chicago and removed Beach and the woman from the plane.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty ashamed and embarrassed by what happened. I could have handled it so much better,\u201d Beach told the Associated Press.\n\nBeach says his Knee Defender was a gift from his wife. \u201cI put them in maybe a third of the time. Usually, the person in front tries [to recline] their seat a couple of times, and then they forget about it,\u201d Beach said. \u201cI\u2019d rather just kind of let them think the seat is broken, rather than start a confrontation.\u201d\n\nAfter getting kicked off his first flight, Beach says he took a Spirit Airlines flight, since the airlines does not use reclining seats.\n\n[AP]", "article_metadata": {"description": "A passenger who got in a fight over reclining seats and was later booted off his flight says he now feels bad about the altercation.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "He says he's embarrassed by how the altercation ended", "title": "Knee Defender Passenger Says He Never Reclines His Seat", "url": "http://time.com/3264803/knee-defender-passenger/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/453559552.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/453559552.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "He says he's embarrassed by how the altercation ended", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Knee Defender Passenger Says He Never Reclines His Seat"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "united, knee defender, airlines, leg room, recline", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "United, knee defender, airlines, leg room, recline"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe2157\"", "article_summary": "James Beach was on an August flight in which he used a product called a \u201cKnee Defender\u201d which prevented the seat in front of his from reclining.\nBeach says his Knee Defender was a gift from his wife.\nAfter the woman seated in front of Beach figured out he had installed the Knee Defender, preventing her from reclining her own seat, the pair got involved in an altercation.\nI could have handled it so much better,\u201d Beach told the Associated Press.\nUsually, the person in front tries [to recline] their seat a couple of times, and then they forget about it,\u201d Beach said."}
