It\u2019s as if @Florida_Man ran an entire town.\n\nThe problem started when Hampton annexed a quarter-mile stretch of highway and set up a nasty speed trap. The police force wrote so many tickets that it went on a spending spree, ending up with one officer for every twenty-five people in the town, not to mention SUVs and AR15s.\n\nThat\u2019s only the beginning. A chunk of the money\u2014some estimate up to $1 million\u2014is missing, while city employees were overpaid and managed to run up a $132,000 tab at the local convenience store. Their last mayor logged only few weeks in office before he was busted for selling oxycodone to an undercover officer. (He disputes the charge: \u201cIf I was some kind of drug dealer, I would at least have a car. I ride a bicycle around town. I had my lights cut off twice last year. If I am a dope dealer, why are my lights getting cut off?\u201d)\n\nIt\u2019s bad enough that Governor Rick Scott \u2014 this Rick Scott! \u2014 has suspended the mayor and the Florida legislature may dissolve the township. Which is too bad, as it has some creative borders:\n\nWatch the clip below, via CNN:\n\n[h/t CNN]\n\n[Image via screengrab]\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n>> Follow Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) on Twitter", "article_metadata": {"description": "The town of Hampton, Florida is in danger of being \"wiped off the map\" after a massive corruption investigation highlighted dozens of abuses of local and", "generator": "WordPress 2016.21", "og": {"image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cnn2.jpg", "title": "Most Corrupt Town in America in Danger of Being \u2018Wiped Off the Map\u2019"}, "twitter": {"description": "The town of Hampton, Florida is in danger of being \"wiped off the map\" after a massive corruption investigation highlighted dozens of abuses of local and federal laws.", "title": "Most Corrupt Town in America in Danger of Being 'Wiped Off the Map'", "image": "http://static01.mediaite.com/med/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cnn2.jpg", "creator": "@@evanmcmurry", "site": "@mediaite", "card": "summary"}, "NextGEN": "1.5.5", "date": "2014-03-09T15:56:21+00:00", "keywords": "online", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.5, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd93ca\"", "article_summary": "The town of Hampton, Florida is in danger of being \u201cwiped off the map\u201d after a massive corruption investigation highlighted dozens of abuses of local and federal laws.\nIf I am a dope dealer, why are my lights getting cut off?\u201d)It\u2019s bad enough that Governor Rick Scott \u2014 this Rick Scott!\nTheir last mayor logged only few weeks in office before he was busted for selling oxycodone to an undercover officer.\nThe problem started when Hampton annexed a quarter-mile stretch of highway and set up a nasty speed trap.\n(He disputes the charge: \u201cIf I was some kind of drug dealer, I would at least have a car."}
