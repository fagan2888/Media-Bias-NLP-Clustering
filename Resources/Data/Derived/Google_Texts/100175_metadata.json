It turns out it's not the first time it has happened.\n\nPolice are now looking for 37-year-old Teresa Vandiver. Court papers state she had one other child, a baby girl, that was stillborn. Autopsies at the medical examiners showed both babies had meth in their system.\n\nVandiver has been arrested before accused of trespassing and stealing a car but has never faced any drug charges in Oklahoma County.\n\nCourt papers state in August of 2012, Vandiver gave birth to a son inside a home in southeast Oklahoma City after going into labor early. She and her husband then called 911, and the baby was rushed to Southwest Medical Center by ambulance where he later died.\n\nCourt papers state Vandiver said she had not received any prenatal care and could not remember all the pregnancies she has had, but said this was not the first infant death she has had due to preterm birth.\n\nInitially, Vandiver denied drug use, but said she had used methamphetamine in the past.\n\nHospital records at Southwest Medical Center show she tested positive for meth when she brought in her son.\n\nShe told investigators one of her children was taken away at birth due to meth being found in her system.\n\nCourt papers state DHS records show Vandiver gave birth to a stillborn child in September of 2011, and that the reporting party stated the baby girl died due to the mothers meth usage.\n\nThe medical examiner's report listed the probable cause of death as stillbirth due to unknown etiology with possible methamphetamine toxicity. The medical examiner listed the manner of death as unknown, but listed maternal drug abuse as a possible factor.\n\nWe went to Vandiver's last known address but no one was home.\n\nNeighbors said they have seen a lot of drug activity going on here in the past but claimed the family that used to live here had moved a while back.\n\nNow police are left looking for this mother, who desperately needs help kicking the habit, and who now faces a criminal felony charge as a result.\n\nCourt papers also state this mother had other children that tested positive for meth at birth and lived. All of them have been placed in protective custody.", "article_metadata": {"wn-build": "XSLT-7.1-14", "Description": "An Oklahoma City mother is facing felony child neglect charges, after prosecutors determined she took methamphetamine while pregnant.", "author": "Adrianna Iwasinski", "og": {"url": "http://www.news9.com/story/24667712/woman-arrested", "image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24667712_SA.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "An Oklahoma City mother is facing felony child neglect charges, after prosecutors determined she took methamphetamine while pregnant.", "title": "Police Search For Woman Who Used Meth During Pregnancies"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://KWTV.images.worldnow.com/images/24667712_SA.jpg", "description": "An Oklahoma City mother is facing felony child neglect charges, after prosecutors determined she took methamphetamine while pregnant.", "card": "summary", "title": "Police Search For Woman Who Used Meth During Pregnancies"}, "wnreadableurl": "woman-arrested", "ROBOTS": "Index,Follow,NoArchive", "owner": "KWTV", "fb": {"app_id": 538140636230283}, "date": "2014/02/07", "KEYWORDS": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news, mother, facing, felony, child, neglect, charges, meth, pregnant, news 9, news9.com, kwtv", "wn-version": "ContainerE-Story", "wn-base": "IIS25", "verify-v1": "d5ZN+GNiazjgWlnr3WHikwraMvFljdUSLMgex4CGnc8=", "news_keywords": "oklahoma city,okc,media,news, mother, facing, felony, child, neglect, charges, meth, pregnant, news 9, news9.com, kwtv"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd171c\"", "article_summary": "An Oklahoma City mother is facing felony child neglect charges, after prosecutors determined she took methamphetamine while pregnant.\nCourt papers also state this mother had other children that tested positive for meth at birth and lived.\nCourt papers state in August of 2012, Vandiver gave birth to a son inside a home in southeast Oklahoma City after going into labor early.\nCourt papers state she had one other child, a baby girl, that was stillborn.\nShe told investigators one of her children was taken away at birth due to meth being found in her system."}
