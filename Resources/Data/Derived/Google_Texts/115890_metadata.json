We ask that you do so without delay.\"\n\nThe senators gave McDonald two weeks to respond to their letter.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The senators said the VA has the authority to grant benefits to C-123 veterans.", "description": "The senators said the VA has the authority to grant benefits to C-123 veterans.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "rdfs": {"label skos": {"prefLabel": "Floor Action"}}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The senators said the VA has the authority to grant benefits to C-123 veterans.", "title": "Senators press VA on Agent Orange", "url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/240183-senators-press-va-on-agent-orange", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/veteransaffairsva_032615getty.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/240183-senators-press-va-on-agent-orange", "dcterms.date": "2015-04-27T13:54-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Jordain Carney", "author": "Jordain Carney", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Richard Blumenthal, Elizabeth Warren, Michael Bennet, Sherrod Brown, Richard Burr, Jeff Merkley, Ron Wyden,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-04-27T13:54:41-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/240183-senators-press-va-on-agent-orange", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The senators said the VA has the authority to grant benefits to C-123 veterans.", "card": "summary", "title": "Senators press VA on Agent Orange"}, "dcterms.title": "Senators press VA on Agent Orange"}, "article_summary": "Seven senators are pushing Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Secretary Bob McDonald to grant benefits for Agent Orange exposure to a group of post-Vietnam veterans.\nC-123 veterans have struggled for decades to get the VA to grant benefits for their illnesses, which they believe are tied to Agent Orange exposure.\nand(D-Colo.) said that justice \"is long overdue\" for veterans who crewed C-123 aircraft after the Vietnam War.\nThe senators added that Congress has told the VA to act \"in the best interest\" of veterans seeking benefits \"whenever possible,\" and they believe the VA currently has the needed statutory authority to grant benefits to the C-123 group.\nAgent Orange exposure has been tied a range of diseases including cancer."}
