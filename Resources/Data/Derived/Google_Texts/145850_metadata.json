That doesn\u2019t make their attempts any less laughable, though. You won\u2019t believe some of the absurd things that they\u2019ve accused him of being responsible for, starting with the most recent example:\n\n1. The Popularity of Donald Trump\n\nThe GOP has gotten used to blaming Obama for just about everything, so at a time when a party outsider (and narcissistic lunatic) has become the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nominee, establishment Republicans have started questioning whether Obama is responsible for the \u201crise\u201d of Trump, too.\n\nGive credit to Obama for not breaking out into laughter when a member of the press asked a similar question. \u201cI have been blamed by Republicans for a lot of things, but being blamed for their primaries and who they\u2019re selecting for their party is novel,\u201d Obama said.\n\nInstead, Obama pointed to the \u201ccircus\u201d-like atmosphere the Republicans and the media have encouraged this election cycle. Add to that the anti-government, obstructionist rhetoric the Republicans have been peddling throughout Obama\u2019s administration, and the popularity of Trump makes a lot of sense. The Republicans may have created this monster by directing so much hate toward Obama, but that doesn\u2019t make it Obama\u2019s fault.\n\n2. Hurricane Katrina\n\nIn a 2013 survey of Louisiana Republicans, pollsters asked participants who they blamed for the nation\u2019s poor response following Hurricane Katrina. 28% blamed George W. Bush, who was serving as president at the time. That response that isn\u2019t too surprising given how much criticism Bush subsequently faced for his apparent apathy toward the region.\n\nWhat is surprising is the one person on the poll who beat Bush: Obama. 29% of Louisiana Republicans saw fit to criticize President Obama for the disaster. That\u2019s a particularly bold person to blame considering that Obama did not take the nation\u2019s top office for nearly three and a half years following the hurricane.\n\nIt\u2019d be one thing if these were the thoughts of Republicans in other states who are used to blaming Obama for just about anything. However, these are residents of Louisiana, people who know darned well what went down following Katrina. Somehow, they still can\u2019t help but incriminate Obama despite lacking any solid reason.\n\n3. The 2008 Economic Crash\n\nIn a speech last year, Republican Senator Ted Cruz made a bold proclamation: Obama is to blame for the 2008 economic depression. Never mind that Obama didn\u2019t get inaugurated as president until 2009, there\u2019s no place for simple facts on the campaign trail!\n\nThis trick was no mistake, either. In the same sentence, Cruz blames Jimmy Carter for the state of the economy in the years following his presidency, while simultaneously blaming Obama for the years leading into his own presidency. The way he woxrded his gripe couldn\u2019t be more obvious that he was fudging the numbers. That\u2019s why MSNBC reported, \u201cCruz is playing a dishonest little game, assuming that his audience isn\u2019t smart enough to notice the con.\u201d\n\nSubsequently, Cruz went on to blame the president and Obamacare for his family not having health care anymore. In reality, Cruz simply forgot (or neglected) to sign up for his government-covered health care guaranteed to all members of Congress. It was later revealed that his health coverage had never lapsed since he had been automatically re-enrolled for health care. It sure did make an interesting talking point for Cruz, though!\n\n4. Sarah Palin\u2019s Son Assaulting His Girlfriend\n\nFormer vice presidential candidate Palin is no stranger to spinning lies, but her latest attack on Obama was a stretch even for her. In January, Palin\u2019s son Track was arrested by the police after physically assaulting his girlfriend and brandishing a weapon while drunk.\n\nIt\u2019s an embarrassing incident, for sure, but one that mama Palin tried to excuse by pointing the finger at Obama instead. In a speech, she referenced Track\u2019s service in the military and alluded to some PTSD that followed. She then blamed that PTSD on Track and fellow soldiers not feeling \u201crespected\u201d by the president after putting his life on the line.\n\nIf it\u2019s hard to follow the logic of how Obama made Track beat his girlfriend, that\u2019s because there is no logic to it. Track served in Iraq during the Bush administration in a war that Bush started under false pretenses. While I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if PTSD did play a role in Track\u2019s violent outbursts and potential issues with alcohol, that has nothing to do with Obama not loving the troops enough. Besides, it\u2019s the Republicans who keep trying to cut funding for veteran health services that could help people like Track.\n\nPhoto Credit: Justin Sloan / Flickr", "article_metadata": {"description": "Not everything is the president's fault, but that doesn't stop Republicans from desperately trying to pin it on him anyway.", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3171/3170702.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "barack obama,obama,thanks obama,ted cruz,donald trump,sarah palin,track palin,accountability,blame,economy", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cI have been blamed by Republicans for a lot of things, but being blamed for their primaries and who they\u2019re selecting for their party is novel,\u201d Obama said.\n29% of Louisiana Republicans saw fit to criticize President Obama for the disaster.\nWhat is surprising is the one person on the poll who beat Bush: Obama.\n\u201cThanks, Obama!\u201d It\u2019s a catchphrase so popular that even President Barack Obama has poked fun at it in a video:While Obama uses it in jest, plenty of conservatives try to use it earnest.\nNever mind that Obama didn\u2019t get inaugurated as president until 2009, there\u2019s no place for simple facts on the campaign trail!"}
