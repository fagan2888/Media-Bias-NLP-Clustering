He doesn\u2019t hit anybody, he says, until they take a swing at him first. You can quibble about just how faithful to that philosophy Trump has really been, but for the most part he has reserved his most vitriolic comments for opponents who have gone after him directly.\n\nBack in November, Trump said that he thought eventually even Texas Sen. Ted Cruz would have to come after him.\n\nRelated: Trump Shines in a Substance-Free GOP Debate\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s going to have to hit me,\u201d Trump said at a rally in Georgia. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a sad day, but we will hit back\u2014I promise.\u201d\n\nHowever, over the past few weeks Cruz, unlike his other competitors, has forced Trump to go on the offensive in a way that the cranky billionaire hasn\u2019t before. The Texas senator has been gaining on Trump in national polls \u2013 though he is still trailing by a significant margin \u2013 and is leading him in some Iowa polls. A Cruz victory in the Iowa caucus, the first vote of the primary, would seriously dim the aura of inevitability that Trump has been cultivating since last summer.\n\nLeading into last Thursday\u2019s republican debate, Cruz has definitely criticized Trump in public, but not to the degree some of the other targets of the billionaire\u2019s ire had done. However, Trump was plainly feeling the heat. The tightening poll numbers pushed him into repeated questions about Cruz\u2019s eligibility for the presidency because of his Canadian birth.\n\nThe two tangled about the birther issue and about Cruz\u2019s disdain for New York City in the debate, but it was in the days that followed that Trump took to his preferred platform for attack \u2013 Twitter \u2013 and really began going after Cruz in earnest.\n\nRelated: Cruz\u2019s Unreported $1 Million in Bank Loans Won\u2019t Help His Presidential Bid\n\nWhen The New York Times late Friday reported that Cruz had funded one of his campaigns with the assistance of a large loan from Goldman Sachs \u2013 the New York investment bank that employs his wife, Heidi Cruz \u2013 and had failed to disclose it on a Federal Election Commission form, Trump pounced:\n\n\u201cGreatly dishonest of @tedcruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen will @tedcruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him[?]\u201d\n\nThe Cruz campaign later revealed that there was a second loan that it had not disclosed and \u2013 no surprise \u2013 Trump could hardly wait to Tweet about that, too. \u201cTed Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!\u201d\n\nRelated: Is Nikki Haley Hitching Her Wagon to Lone Star Ted Cruz?\n\nTellingly, Trump didn\u2019t stick to the information available in recent media reports. Uncharacteristically, he did some research and went after Cruz for something that happened almost a year ago \u2013 a meeting he had with potential donors who are gay.\n\n\u201cTed is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money, does another for votes,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAnd, \u201cIf Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?\u201d\n\nFor his part, Cruz seemed to revel in the fact that Trump has been forced to respond to him, and insisted it was related to their relative standing in the polls.\n\n\u201cI imagine it pulled him out of bed this morning and sent him tweeting and tweeting and tweeting,\u201d he said. \u201cI think in terms of a commander in chief, we ought to have someone who isn't springing out of bed to tweet in a frantic response to the latest polls.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "It\u2019s been a point of pride for Donald Trump to say that in his presidential campaign, he\u2019s been a counter-puncher.
