This is no different than it was some 15 years ago. I once worked for the polls in South Elgin. I always thought it was disgraceful that Americans don't take their freedom to vote more seriously. Americans complain after voting but don't take the time to vote.\n\nBeware of proposed Bill S.1911: There is a bill being pushed: the Reach Every Mother and Child Act of 2015, S.1911. I urge everybody to read that bill very carefully. It is government intervention into the lives of everyone. It even proposes to tell you when you should have your babies. I'm not opposed to Planned Parenthood, but I am opposed to government intervening in every aspect of our lives. This bill talks about mothers and children around the world. Why can't those governments take care of their own? Why are we the only ones helping them? I urge the senators and representatives to think very carefully before they pass a bill that's not needed and not wanted.\n\nSenior situation: Seniors, isn't it wonderful to have Obamacare? You go to your primary care physician with a health concern. After they take your blood pressure, pulse and weight, if you're over 70, you hear from your doctor that you're too old or that at your age, the doctor can't do anything about it. You might also be told to go to a specialist for your problem. So you go to a specialist who either says that he doesn't know if insurance will cover your problem or he will order some pain medicine for you. That's not all. They want you off the road for driving. You are too much of a risk. It's wonderful to grow old. Your kids don't want you. Doctors don't want you. You can't drive. Just put you away in an old people home and live like cattle. They will dictate when and where you will go daily and when it's time to eat. You just don't need a brain anymore. Everyone tells you what to do and when to do it. It's really fun to be a senior.\n\nMarches do not stop gang violence: Instead of holding marches and demonstrations against gang violence in Chicago, people need to turn in the shooters when they are approached by the police. Nothing is going to be accomplished by marching and setting teddy bears by the crime scene. They need to do more than that.\n\nTurned off by Trump: When I first started listening to Donald Trump, I felt somewhat neutral. Now the more I hear him, the more my stomach aches. This guy is nothing but a phony all the way. He talks about how much money he makes and how everyone likes him. He talks about his faith in the Bible now, but he never talked about it before. If there's a way for him to score points, he will.\n\nSyrian situation: I see that President Obama wants to bring in 100,000 Syrians to the United States. Why doesn't he just send them to Mexico? Mexico is pretty empty because they are all here.\n\nFormer dairy on Prairie gets paint job: That lousy-looking former dairy on Prairie Street in Aurora was finally painted after six years. It's about time. I guess we will have to wait a little longer for the removal of the graffiti. Between the shootings and the neglected buildings, no wonder people have lost confidence in this city.\n\nFoil food bank abusers: I believe people are abusing the system by going from one food bank to another. All local food banks should get together and issue a card that is stamped with the date on it every time they get food. I bet there are a lot of people abusing the system. It's not fair for the people who really need it.\n\nCarson comment: Dr. Ben Carson just got into trouble for saying that a Muslim should not be the president. I don't know why he said it, but the Constitution states that a person of any religion can be the president. What bothers me is Muslims are now calling for Carson to take himself out of the presidential race. Why? Do we no longer have freedom of speech in our country where we can give our opinions? The politically correct police need to knock it off. People are getting tired of them.\n\nSave the trees: As the computer age was coming into use, the old saying was to conserve paper and save the trees. Today we get more paper materials in our mailboxes, which I'm sure is mostly shredded. Everything is supposed to be on the computer. Not true. We are bombarded with paperwork every day. We have advertising fliers coming out of our ears. It's like a battle between retailers, restaurants and car dealers. Our recycle bins are loaded with paper. Let's cut back on this.\n\nChoose between religious beliefs and almighty bucks: I would like to talk about the hypocrite Kim Davis and the rest of the hypocrites who believe what she's doing is right. When you are sworn into public office, you take an oath to do what is asked of you at your job. If your faith in God goes against what you are doing, and you truly believe this is not right, you are putting that $80,000 a year in front of your religious beliefs. That makes you a hypocrite. It seems like she wants both God and the money. But if she has to choose, she wants the money and pretends she loves God.\n\nEditor's note\n\nSpeak Out is a reader-generated column of opinions.
