Massachusetts already had near-universal health insurance coverage and is moving in the direction of containing costs. But the national law still requires changes. Some are in advancing concepts such as more coordinated and integrated care, pushed by new payment models in Medicare. Others are in small regulatory details, for example laws requiring insurers to fit their plans into federal categories.\n\n\"Fundamentally, we did not have to change our business model, mostly because we had the preexisting health reform program here in Massachusetts, on which the federal law was based,\" said Bruce Bullen, chief operating officer of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts. At the same time, he said, \"I think people were surprised at the extent of the change that was needed to reconcile the actual rules of the federal system and the local system.\"\n\nSeveral insurers said the biggest changes were technical. For example, insurers had to fit all their products into four categories, based on their actuarial value, referred to as \"metallic tiers.\" (The actuarial value reflects the percentage of a person's health costs the insurer is expected to pay.) That makes it easier for shoppers to compare insurance plans since a \"bronze level\" plan from Blue Cross Blue Shield must be comparable to a bronze plan by Health New England.\n\nThe result, as Bullen described it, was \"everybody had a new price and everybody had a new product.\"\n\nDave Przesiek, chief sales and marketing officer for Fallon Community Health Plan, said in the long-term, the change will probably help consumers and business owners choose plans because there will be more uniformity. In the short term, the company had to rebuild its entire portfolio of products, making some more robust and some less, and had to communicate that to customers.\n\nThere are also several new fees the Affordable Care Act imposes on insurers, which will be added to the cost of plans. Jim Kessler, vice president and general counsel at Health New England, said these add less than 5 percent to the cost of a Health New England plan.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act also changes the number of \"ratings factors\" - things like age or participation in a wellness plan \u2013 that insurers can use to calculate the price of premiums. This will result in lower prices for some individuals and small businesses and higher prices for others.\n\nOne change for businesses is that the Affordable Care Act will require employers to provide \"affordable\" coverage, meaning it costs less than 9.5 percent of their employees' household income. So some employers are looking for cheaper plans, including plans that limit which doctors a person can see or require patients to pay a higher deductible when they go to a more expensive hospital.\n\n\"That\u2019s one component we're starting to get more interest in,\" Przesiek said. \"Employers are saying 'I'm concerned about the 9.5 percent. Do you have a more affordable option?'\"\n\nAlso in 2014, insurers will have to put the prices of procedures at different hospitals online. Currently, insurers must provide that information by phone.\n\nKessler said the bottom line is, \"We had to do a tremendous amount of work in 2013 to make relatively small changes in a large number of areas so the details of what we do line up with the requirements of the ACA.\"\n\nInsurers and providers also had to deal with the problems plaguing the state's Health Connector website. The problems have resulted in errors in health insurance sign-ups and in enrollment processes that should have been done online automatically instead being done by hand using spreadsheets and multiple computer systems. This affects individuals currently buying coverage through the state's Commonwealth Care and those signing up for the first time through the exchange for subsidized or unsubsidized plans.\n\n\"It's going to take a lot of work to get all those many thousands of people across the Commonwealth either\u2026re-enrolled and signed up or moved to new plan or new program or new carrier and have their coverage continue without a break,\" Kessler said.\n\nOn a larger scale, the Affordable Care Act is encouraging providers to change the way care is delivered. Mark Fulco, a spokesman for Mercy Medical Center, said the Affordable Care Act implementation is the culmination of \"dramatic change and transformational change that we've actually been undertaking for several years.\"\n\nThrough new Medicare rules, the law provides incentives to move away from a fee for service model of payment toward a method of payment that essentially pays per patient, rewarding doctors who provide less expensive care for equally good outcomes.\n\nThe law creates a \"Medicare Shared Savings\" program, for which hospitals can voluntarily sign up by creating an \"accountable care organization.\" What that means is a primary care doctor works with a team of doctors to care for a population of Medicare patients. The doctors are paid for that population, rather than for each procedure. If the doctors meet quality standards and provide care below a certain cost, the savings are split between the insurer and the doctors. Although the changes only apply to Medicare, some commercial insurers are moving in the same direction. For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays 85 percent of its doctors through a global payment system, which it has been evolving for five years.\n\n\"Ten years ago, you were simply paid for hospital admissions and procedures and office visits, and the government or managed care payers didn't pay an awful lot of attention to the quality of the outcome,\" said Dr. Mark Keroack, president and CEO of Baystate Medical Center. \"Now there are clear bonuses to be had for delivering exceptional quality and penalties to be incurred if you have below average quality or complications.\"\n\nBoth Baystate Medical Center and Mercy Medical Center have partnered with other area physicians to create accountable care organizations serving seniors on Medicare. Between Medicare and similar arrangements with commercial insurers, around 60 to 70 percent of primary care patients at Baystate are in a shared savings payment arrangement, Keroack said.\n\n\"Baystate has embraced this as a philosophy,\" Keroack said. \"If we're going to build this infrastructure, health records, pay case managers, bill different kinds of primary care, we might as well be doing population health for all our patients rather than just a few of them.\"\n\nThere is also new federal money available through the Affordable Care Act for technology such as electronic medical records. Baystate put in place new electronic medical records both within Baystate Health and connecting to several other medical practices. Mercy Medical Center created a physical hub with a new computer software system that tracks and coordinates a patient's care as they move through the medical system. It implemented a new electronic medical record system and an online portal where patients can view their own records. Baystate, Mercy Medical Center and Holyoke Medical Center are all connecting to the state's new health information exchange, which allows for the sharing of medical records among providers, with a patient's consent.\n\n\"We knew that the Affordable Care Act was going to demand improvements in better coordination of care,\" Fulco said. \"We said we need to implement it. We need to be ahead of the curve.\"\n\nTim Gens, executive vice president of the Massachusetts Hospital Association, said the changes in Massachusetts are not as dramatic as in other states because Massachusetts was already working on reforming its health care system, through its 2006 health care overhaul and subsequent legislation aimed at cutting health care costs.\n\n\"The Affordable Care Act in its broad outlines mimics to a great extent what Massachusetts is trying to do,\" Gens said. \"The Affordable Care Act is reinforcing the path we're on about more integrated delivery of care and payment for care that\u2019s tied more toward outcomes and taking care of populations. It's not just about treating people on an episodic basis, but looking at taking care of patients.\"", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "affordable-care-act, baystate-medical-center, blue-cross-blue-shield, fallon-community-health-plan, health-care, health-care-costs, health-new-england, mercy-medical-center, outlook-2014, news", "title": "Outlook 2014: Affordable Care Act changes business for area health insurers and hospitals", "og": {"site_name": "masslive.com", "description": "The Affordable Care Act is advancing concepts such as more coordinated and integrated care, pushed by new payment models in Medicare.
