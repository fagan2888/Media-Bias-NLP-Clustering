The failure rate for first-time maintenance of certification exams has been steadily increasing since 2009, says cardiologist Westby Fisher, MD, in a July 9 blog post.

Fisher examined data on first-time test takers published by the American Board of Internal Medicine.

Some highlights:

In 2013, about one in six (17.52%) physicians failed the exam.

From 2009 to 2013, the number of test takers increased by 40% (8,744 to 12,201).

The percentage of test takers failing increased by nearly 80% since 2009 (when it was 9.85%) and has risen every year.

It is unclear why more physicians are failing the exam, but Fisher had some guesses.

The exams test increasingly more material, which pressures doctors into attending study courses created by specialty societies to cull relevant information, Fisher told MedPage Today.

Courses cost several thousand dollars to attend and include hints about the exam content. Doctors who forgo them are disadvantaged at test time, he said.

In addition, MOC exams are computerized. It is likely that an increasing number of physicians whose last certification exams were on paper now must use unfamiliar software, Fisher told MedPage Today.

There's no sitting on the fence when it comes to revised maintenance of certification (MOC) rules. Some doctors love them, while others hate them. This blog gathers MOC-related news and opinion to foster discussion on what has happened since January 2014, when the American Board of Internal Medicine adopted the requirements -- and what is likely to happen in coming months.
