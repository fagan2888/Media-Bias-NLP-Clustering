Here\u2019s what she told them:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to censor myself to make you comfortable. If you haven\u2019t made anyone uncomfortable by what you have to say, then you aren\u2019t being real. You\u2019re not telling the truth. I\u2019m not here for respectability politics. I don\u2019t give a shit. What I care about are my black people.\u201d\n\nWith megaphones in hand and their bodies in the streets, these protesters rejected respectability to articulate a new mode of direct-action politics.\n\nTwo days later, I joined a crowd roughly 500 strong as it left D.C.\u2019s Chinatown to march in a broad circuit, shutting down major intersections throughout the city. Streaming through the streets around suddenly gridlocked traffic, we were able to talk to people in their cars. Some honked in support. Others honked in anger. Some high-fived us, others flipped us off \u2014 and a few tried to run us over. But, a surprising number seemed happy to have been caught up in something larger than themselves; swept up in something more real and important than whatever destination they had once been rushing off to. Nonetheless, through confrontation and disruption, we would make certain that people heard us even if many weren\u2019t yet willing to listen.\n\nThe very act of blockading traffic with one\u2019s body demands a certain liberation from the stifling constraints of respectability. In Ta-Nehesi Coates\u2019s memorable phrase, the politics of respectability is \u201cthe politics of changing the subject\u201d from police killings of unarmed black men to the behavior of black victims of police brutality.\n\nAs a politics, respectability has long shaped negotiations across the color line. In exchange for a promise to morally police the behavior of poor and working-class black populations, potential white allies validate the leadership of middle-class and elite African-Americans. It also marginalizes those not willing to check their anger, or those who don\u2019t (or refuse to) use proper language to express that anger. In effect, the politics of respectability accepts the exclusion of those deemed unrespectable from the protections of first-class citizenship.\n\nThis strategy originally developed alongside the advance of Jim Crow at the end of the 19th century. Respectability politics publicly accepted the principles of disfranchisement and segregation and sought to redraw the racial exclusions of the new Jim Crow order along the lines of class and gender instead. In the face of an implacable white supremacy, it represented an attempt on the part of black elites to preserve some measure of political power by trying to convert white paternalism into a genuine interracial politics. When confronted with disfranchisement in 1899, Georgia\u2019s black leadership declared themselves willing to defend the purity of the ballot against \u201cignorant black voters\u201d just so long as those restrictions applied to black and white alike. In so doing, they attempted to forge an alliance of black and white elites to uplift the unrespectable, unwashed masses of both races.\n\nHowever, these sorts of negotiations across the color line have always been problematic. For one, those white allies are in no way obligated to reciprocate. Even worse, this politics of respectability powerfully reinforces racist stereotypes of black depravity and criminality, justifying the murders of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner. As unrespectable black men, they were asking for it.\n\nEarlier in the 20th century, this same discourse encouraged black elites to defend both disfranchisement and segregation as a means of eliminating the \u201cunqualified\u201d from politics and the \u201cunrespectable\u201d from public space. Some even urged the formation of interracial lynch mobs to hunt suspected black criminals, whose failure to conform to middle-class standards of respectability they felt endangered the reputation of the race.\n\nOver the course of my march through the streets of D.C. it became evident that the rupture with respectability politics had begun to create a space \u2013 even if momentarily \u2013 for a new kind of politics. Indeed, one of the most popular chants of the evening was \u201cWe Shut Shit Down.\u201d The crowd also chanted \u201cIf We Can\u2019t Breathe, You Can\u2019t Breathe!,\u201d words that carried the promise of retaliation, of pushing back, of not turning the other cheek, of resistance. Another call and response made this threat of retaliation even more explicit. It began with a demand: \u201cWhat do you want? Justice! When do you want it? Now!\u201d And ended with a threat: \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t get it? Shut it down! Shut it down!\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Cops are getting away with murder, so protesters are taking a stand. And if that makes you uncomfortable?
