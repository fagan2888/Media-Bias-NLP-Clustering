What\u2019s going on is wrong \u2014 bad things like killing children.\u201d\n\nShe was among about 500 demonstrators who walked to the United Nations on Manhattan\u2019s East Side after gathering behind police barricades off Columbus Circle to protest Israeli actions in the Gaza Strip.\n\nHamas, which the United States and other countries consider a terrorist organization, governs much of Gaza.\n\nIn midtown Manhattan, police on motorcycles stood by, engines revved up to accompany the marchers before they peacefully headed toward the United Nations building.\n\n\u201cWe are all Palestinians and because of the occupation there is no justice in Gaza,\u201d said Zouleikha Ban, 57, a native of Algeria who lives in the borough of Staten Island.\n\nSeveral days previously, hundreds of Palestinian supporters marched and demonstrated in front of a midtown Manhattan office building after a 72-hour humanitarian cease fire broke down in Gaza.
