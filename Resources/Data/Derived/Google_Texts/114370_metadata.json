And the message certainly got out: the two videos have racked up more than 20 million YouTube views.\n\nBut with tie-in video games, trivia contests and direct links to Chipotle\u2019s in-house Cultivate Foundation, critics say they\u2019re also calculated sales messages that recall both the early days of television (think Kraft Television Theatre) and the sophisticated image-tending that \u201cFarmed and Dangerous\u201d satirizes.\n\n\u201cIn the boardrooms of Madison Avenue, they call it \u2018values branding:\u2019 a marketing strategy in which a company tries to instill a feeling of righteousness in the customers who buy its products,\u201d wrote Ted Sheely on the Truth About Trade & Technology site. \u201cBut what kind of values would inspire a corporation to wage a smear campaign against America\u2019s farmers?\u201d\n\nSheely, a farmer and board member on various California farming organizations, disagrees with Chipotle\u2019s stance that genetically-modified crops are dangerous. He compares Chipotle\u2019s latest \u201cploy\u201d to a Super Bowl commercial that makes consumers feel morally superior while tearing down the competition.\n\n\u201cI object to the broad strokes,\u201d said Jo Stanko, who runs a 2,000-acre, fifth-generation cattle ranch outside of Steamboat Springs. \u201cIt\u2019s a conversation we need to be having, but it shouldn\u2019t be to the benefit of just one company.\u201d\n\nChipotle countered that it works with thousands of farmers and ranchers and is not ignoring their concerns.\n\n\u201cWe have nothing but the utmost respect for them,\u201d said Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold. \u201cThey make hard decisions based on what\u2019s best for their farm or their family, and we make our decisions based on what we think is best for our business.\u201d\n\nFounded in Denver in 1993, Chipotle operates more than 1,500 restaurants worldwide. Analysts estimate its stock-market value at more than $15 billion .\n\nRegardless of politics, the show blurs the line between advertising and entertainment. But its inherent quality and compatibility with Chipotle\u2019s message ought to quiet fears of other brands becoming content producers, according to Piro\u2019s Rosenberg.\n\n\u201cSome people think this is the devil,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Oh, a brand creating entertainment? This is the end of the world as we know it!\u2019 But people who have seen the finished product know we\u2019re telling a creative story.\u201d\n\nIf the series is successful, viewers can expect even more.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it feels branded in the slightest,\u201d said Rosenberg. \u201cOn Hulu it sits next to other premium content \u2014 unlike user-generated content on YouTube. And Hulu has a free version, unlike Netflix or Amazon. So we\u2019ve got the widest possible audience and the best of every world.\u201d\n\nJohn Wenzel: 303-954-1642, jwenzel@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johnwenzel", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Chipotle\u2019s comedy series is a new way to brand, but not all are amused", "title": "Chipotle\u2019s comedy series is a new way to brand, but not all are amused", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/02/17/chipotles-comedy-series-is-a-new-way-to-brand-but-not-all-are-amused/", "image": {"width": 560, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140217__chipotle_farmed_dangerousp1.jpg", "height": 314}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20140217__chipotle_farmed_dangerousp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-17T12:54:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T17:03:01+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf38c\"", "article_summary": "Chipotle\u2019s \u201cFarmed and Dangerous,\u201d a four-episode original comedy series that debuted on Hulu on Feb. 17, barely mentions the fast-casual Mexican chain at all.\nChipotle is known for shaking things up, from the Denver restaurant chain\u2019s use of sustainable, locally-produced ingredients to its quirky advertising.\nHe compares Chipotle\u2019s latest \u201cploy\u201d to a Super Bowl commercial that makes consumers feel morally superior while tearing down the competition.\n\u201cOn Hulu it sits next to other premium content \u2014 unlike user-generated content on YouTube.\nBut its inherent quality and compatibility with Chipotle\u2019s message ought to quiet fears of other brands becoming content producers, according to Piro\u2019s Rosenberg."}
