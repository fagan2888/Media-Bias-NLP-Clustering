That changed with new federal guidelines under the Affordable Care Act as well as subsequent determinations based on that law and other existing federal laws, with the Obama administration stressing that trans identity cannot be used as a basis to deny someone the medical care their physicians say they need.\n\nDespite this though, insurers in many states have still dodged offering things like gender affirmation surgery under their insurance plans. Many states have allowed this to continue, usually under the misunderstanding that as surgery isn\u2019t required by every transgender person, the surgeries can be considered elective or cosmetic. This creates monetary barriers to surgeries and treatments, which can cost anywhere up to $30,000 or more, that many trans people cannot afford, meaning they are either forced to go without those treatments, get loans and other forms of credit, or in some circumstances opt to use the services of people who may be dangerously unqualified. As a result, campaigners have worked hard to get states to examine federal guidelines and to use their power to bring insurers within the state into line with the law.\n\nNow, the Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) has done just that. In two separate bulletins dated December 7 and December 10 of 2015, the MIA informs health insurers that transition-related care is no longer an allowable exemption, though this news was only recently revealed to the press. This comes as part of the agency\u2019s overall review of small group health plans and student health plans for 2016-2017.\n\nThe MIA specifically says that, based on federal regulations that were issued in 2012 that prohibit discrimination on grounds of gender identity, \u201cfederal guidance has determined that this type of exclusion is a discriminatory benefit design,\u201d and so cannot be accepted in small-group health plans.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the Maryland Insurance Administration for prohibiting this discriminatory exclusion that has become a fixture in health insurance plans and that has significant harm to the transgender community,\u201d Patrick A. Paschall, executive director of FreeState Legal and Equality Maryland, is quoted as saying. \u201cTransition-related care exclusions serve no other purpose than to discriminate against transgender people. To deny life-saving medical care to an entire population based solely on the fact that they identify as transgender is not only unconscionable, but we believe a violation of federal law.\u201d\n\nThis builds on FreeState Legal\u2019s previous work ensuring that transgender state employees could not be denied the treatment that should rightfully be theirs under state coverage plans. Specifically in that case, it was announced in the later months of 2015 that Maryland will do away with the \u201cSex Reassignment Exclusion\u201d that had been present in state employee care, and instead offer as part of the healthcare plans a \u201cGender Dysphoria Benefit.\u201d This meant that far more state employees were able to access transition-related care. The newly publicized determinations expand that coverage in a similar way by making clear that gender affirmation surgery is not an acceptable exclusion. Oregon and California offer similar trans-inclusive health care coverage for state employees.\n\nCertainly this fight is not just a problem for Maryland. Insurers up and down the country are still disqualifying trans people from accessing transition-related care or are not offering it at all. Obviously though, just ensuring that coverage is available isn\u2019t the only step that\u2019s needed here either. Insurers, like our doctors, must also know enough to offer relevant care to trans people.\n\nThis perhaps demonstrates that barriers and significant issues that can come up for trans people looking to get the healthcare they need to live their lives gender affirmed. Hopefully, it also shows that while some states are doubling down on anti-trans rhetoric, others are taking steps to be more trans inclusive.\n\nPhoto credit: Thinkstock.", "article_metadata": {"description": "In a significant move that builds on federal guidelines under the Affordable Care Act, Maryland's insurance oversight body has issued directives saying that all", "og": {"image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/causes/3169/3168281.large.jpg"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "p": {"domain_verify": "34d24671362965e0c3942e7b3b484ea7"}, "fb": {"app_id": 83187307959}, "keywords": "maryland transition related care,maryland requires insurers to offer transgender surgeries,trans surgery must be offered by marlyand insurers,", "viewport": "width=device-width,user-scalable=no,initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0bcb\"", "article_summary": "This comes as part of the agency\u2019s overall review of small group health plans and student health plans for 2016-2017.\nDespite this though, insurers in many states have still dodged offering things like gender affirmation surgery under their insurance plans.\nNow, the Maryland Insurance Administration (MIA) has done just that.\nUntil relatively recently most if not all care for trans people was either given very poor coverage under health insurance plans or was not covered at all.\nThe newly publicized determinations expand that coverage in a similar way by making clear that gender affirmation surgery is not an acceptable exclusion."}
