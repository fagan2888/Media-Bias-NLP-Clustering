This isn\u2019t about the winning\u2014it\u2019s about the game.)\n\nThe result is a partisan stalemate in which neither side will blink.\n\nAnd once again, this was all by design.\n\nThis showdown was set up at the end of 2014 with the debate over \u201cthe Cromnibus,\u201d the controversial budget bill that funded the government for most of 2015.\n\nMany conservative Republicans were loath to agree to any measure that funded the government didn\u2019t overturn the executive orders.\n\nGet The Beast In Your Inbox!

DREAMers were allowed to stay in the United States in an executive order that the administration issued in 2012.\n\nTo avoid another government shutdown, a compromise was reached before lawmakers went home for the holidays.\n\nMost of the federal government would be funded for a year but the DHS would only receive sufficient appropriations to last through the end of February.\n\nThe idea was that conservatives could force their standoff on immigration then and surely, no one would want to let the government agency responsible for keeping the United States safe go dark.\n\nBut, of course, that is not the case.\n\nTo add more futility to their cause, the DHS will keep on running even without being funded. Workers in key agencies like the Border Patrol and the Transportation Safety Administration are considered \u201cessential\u201d and will report to work regardless\u2014they just won\u2019t be paid to do their jobs.\n\nWhile many other DHS employees could be furloughed, this limitation prevents a shutdown from turning into an immediate crisis and reduces the cost.\n\nOn Sunday, House Speaker John Boehner seemed ready to embrace a potential shutdown and unwilling to consider a compromise.\n\nHe told Fox News, \u201cThe House has acted. We\u2019ve done our job.\u201d Boehner then said, \u201cSenate Democrats are the ones putting us in this precarious position. It\u2019s up to Senate Democrats to get their act together.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not just Senate Democrats who think shutting down the DHS is a bad idea. Senate Republicans\u2014John McCain, Jeff Flake and Mark Kirk, to name a few\u2014also have expressed problems with using the DHS as a way to tweak the president.\n\nThe impasse is also handing Senate Democrats a powerful political weapon.\n\nIn a statement last week Democratic Minority Leader Harry Reid said, \u201cThe Republican Congress is a mess, pure and simple. Democrats are happy to help our Republican colleagues resolve their problems but the first step is for Republican leaders to do the right thing and pass a clean bill to fund Homeland Security.\u201d\n\nThe political dilemma for Republicans is that while a shutdown plays well with their base, it gives them relatively little leverage.\n\nMost key functions of the DHS will be funding regardless and the result of past GOP brinkmanship is that Republicans are likely to bear the burden of the blame for any shutdown.\n\nIt also creates peculiar consequences in the 2016 presidential race as well.\n\nIt combines two delicate political issues of immigration reform and a government shutdown into one package and places more moderate GOP hopefuls in a bind.\n\nDo they want to let what Republicans universally believe is an unconstitutional executive order by the Obama administration stand or do they want to be put in a position of cutting funding to the DHS in the aftermath of a wave of Islamist terror attacks against American allies and interests.\n\nThe result is a familiar dysfunction.\n\nDemocrats won\u2019t yield on Obama\u2019s executive orders\u2014a move that would risk undermining one of the most important actions of the president\u2019s second term and lead to the potential deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants.\n\nRepublicans can\u2019t alienate their conservative base yet again by compromising on what has become such a point of principle.\n\nThis latest episode might frustrating in the short term but, like the last shutdown, it has a predictable end:", "article_metadata": {"twitter": {"site": "@thedailybeast", "card": "summary", "creator": "bencjacobs"}, "keywords": "u.s. poli", "publicationDate": 201502171015, "wrap": "/content/dailybeast/politics", "description": "The House and Senate Republicans are edging ever closer to a totally predictable shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security.", "pageNum": 1, "title": "GOP to DHS: Governing Is Hard", "tags": "topic:politics", "environment": "dev", "platform": "desktop", "template": "article", "type": "house", "parsely-page": "{\"title\":\"GOP to DHS: Governing Is Hard\",\"link\":\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/17/gop-to-dhs-governing-is-hard.html\",\"image_url\":\"http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/17/gop-to-dhs-governing-is-hard/jcr:content/image.crop.410.273.jpg/47472787.cached.jpg\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/17/gop-to-dhs-governing-is-hard\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-02-17T10:15:00+00:00\",\"section\":\"Politics\",\"author\":\"Ben Jacobs\",\"tags\":[\"politics\"]}", "news_keywords": "US Politics", "sectionTaxanomies": "politics", "fb": {"admins": "1703087,30000737,1117577220,1276800108,931159,514915512", "app_id": 189930913679}, "authors": "Ben Jacobs", "article": {"section": "politics", "published_time": "2015-02-17T10:15:00.000Z", "author": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/contributors/ben-jacobshtml"}, "resourceType": "dailybeast2/components/pages/article", "contentpath": "/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/17/gop-to-dhs-governing-is-hard", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Beast", "description": "The House and Senate Republicans are edging ever closer to a totally predictable shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security.", "title": "GOP to DHS: Governing Is Hard", "url": "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/02/17/gop-to-dhs-governing-is-hard.html", "image": "http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/02/17/gop-to-dhs-governing-is-hard/jcr:content/image.img.2000.jpg/1424183636833.cached.jpg", "type": "article"}, "authorIds": "/etc/authors/b/ben-jacobs", "content-type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdcfb2\"", "article_summary": "It\u2019s up to Senate Democrats to get their act together.\u201dBut it\u2019s not just Senate Democrats who think shutting down the DHS is a bad idea.\nWe\u2019ve done our job.\u201d Boehner then said, \u201cSenate Democrats are the ones putting us in this precarious position.\nSMHThe House and Senate Republicans are edging ever closer to a totally predictable shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security.\nDREAMers were allowed to stay in the United States in an executive order that the administration issued in 2012.\nThe impasse is also handing Senate Democrats a powerful political weapon."}
