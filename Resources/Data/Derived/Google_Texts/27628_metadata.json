I wanted to offer more preventative care.\"\n\n\n\nPatients are also guaranteed same- or next-day appointments and are given the cellphone numbers of their doctors for texting or calling anytime.\n\n\n\nSome concierge doctors even make house calls.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really great to not have to be rushing, rushing, rushing every seven minutes \u2013 to have someone come in and to actually get through more than their bag of prescriptions before it was time for them to leave,\" Holthouse said.\n\n\n\nHowever, for patients, the additional time with the doctor comes with an extra cost.\n\n\n\nConcierge care ranges from $1,500 per year to as much as $15,000 per year on the high end, depending on services. That\u2019s usually on top of your insurance.\n\n\n\n\"A concierge practice really says for the doc, 'Hey, I\u2019m only going to be treating the 'haves' \u2013 because if you can\u2019t pay that fee, you\u2019re not going to be a part of that practice,\" KCRA 3\u2019s Dr. Tom Hopkins said.\n\n\n\nHopkins said whether a patient gets high-quality care hinges more on the doctor he or she chooses.\n\n\n\n\"What they\u2019re getting is personalized attention,\" he said. \"And personalized attention doesn\u2019t always translate into higher quality.\"\n\n\n\nAt least a handful of doctors in the Sacramento area practice concierge medicine. But it\u2019s far from a trend, according to Aileen Wetzel, the CEO of the Sierra Sacramento Valley Medical Society, which represents more than 3,000 doctors.\n\n\u201cThis area is very highly managed,\" Wetzel said. \"We have large medical groups and health systems, as well as physicians in solo and small practices. So, it really hasn\u2019t been something that has taken off here locally.\"\n\n\n\nHowever, patients like Verseput said they can\u2019t live without the concierge services they receive now.\n\n\n\nVerseput explained reasons why, including \"time with the doctor, feeling like they\u2019re not in a hurry and the ability to just call her up and ask questions.\"\n\n\n\nThe concierge doctor acts as a general physician. The patient and his or her insurance will still have to pay for a specialist, lab work and surgeries.", "article_metadata": {"category": "News", "ib-analytics": "data", "item-publish-date": "Mon, 17 Feb 2014 20:18:32 PST", "generator": "CoreMedia", "author": "Claire Doan", "og": {"site_name": "KCRA", "description": "Concierge medicine is touted as a new, better form of health care, with more personalized attention from your doctor and even same-day appointments.", "title": "Concierge doctors: Are they worth the higher price?", "url": "http://www.kcra.com/news/concierge-doctors-are-they-worth-the-higher-price/24530844", "image": "http://www.kcra.com/image/view/-/24530846/highRes/1/-/maxh/630/maxw/1200/-/15fvh0l/-/concierge-doctors-png.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.kcra.com/news/concierge-doctors-are-they-worth-the-higher-price/24530844", "app": {"url": {"ipad": "kcra://content/article/24530844", "iphone": "kcra://content/article/24530844", "googleplay": "kcra://content/article/24530844"}, "name": {"ipad": "kcra", "iphone": "kcra", "googleplay": "kcra"}, "id": {"ipad": 505581274, "iphone": 505581274, "googleplay": "com.hearst.android.kcra"}}, "site": "@kcranews", "card": "app"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "kcra://content/article/24530844", "app_name": "kcra", "package": "com.hearst.android.kcra"}, "ios": {"url": "kcra://content/article/24530844", "app_store_id": 505581274, "app_name": "kcra"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 102798321191}, "keywords": "concierge doctors, higher-price, same-day appointments, northern california health stories, n1Health Center for Functional Medicine in El Dorado Hills, Claire Doan, kcra, kcra3, kcra 3, kcra news, kcra channel, kcra.com", "google-site-verification": "lseesGPufjGiNJ4blx9-qW5A0JKGfgPc9Mw6RTc9Ulo", "news_keywords": "concierge doctors, higher-price, same-day appointments, northern california health stories, n1Health Center for Functional Medicine in El Dorado Hills, Claire Doan, kcra, kcra3, kcra 3, kcra news, kcra channel, kcra.com", "description": "Concierge medicine is touted as a new, better form of health care, with more personalized attention from your doctor and even same-day appointments."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9d4f\"", "article_summary": "Watch report -- Concierge doctors: Are they worth the price?\nDoctors Kristine Burke and Mark Holthouse practice concierge medicine at the n1Health Center for Functional Medicine in El Dorado Hills.\nAt least a handful of doctors in the Sacramento area practice concierge medicine.\nSome concierge doctors even make house calls.\nThe concierge doctor acts as a general physician."}
