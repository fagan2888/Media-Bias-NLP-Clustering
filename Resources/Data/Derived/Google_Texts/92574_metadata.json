But one way to assist in boosting your immune system as well as fighting your seasonal affective disorder during the months of flu, darkness, and general down-trodden spirits, is to make sure your Vitamin D levels are up to par.\n\nVitamin D, known as the \u201csunshine vitamin,\u201d is essential to maintaining our health and immune systems, and our main source is from the sun. Studies have shown that vitamin D deficiencies can lead to a slew of health problems and contribute to chronic disorders, including osteoporosis, depression, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. So if you want to maintain your Vitamin D levels, especially if you\u2019re living in the Northeast during the winter months, read about the various ways you can do so below.\n\nA Tiny Bit Of Sunlight\n\nIn the winter time, people typically hibernate indoors; not to mention there\u2019s barely enough sunshine during the day, and by the time you leave work it\u2019s already dark out. So how is it possible to snatch some of those important rays in the winter, especially when the sun isn\u2019t as strong and it\u2019s freezing outside?\n\nThe fact is, you won\u2019t be able to get as much Vitamin D from the sun between the months of November and March. But spending even small snippets of time outside when the sky does clear up and the sun shines through is better than nothing. In addition, planning vacations or short trips to Southern states or warmer areas can provide you with much-needed Vitamin D boosts, at least temporarily. If you can\u2019t swing that, then it might be time to turn to artificial lighting, tanning booths (in moderation), or most importantly, diet.\n\nVitamin D-Fortified Diet\n\nCertain foods are fortified with Vitamin D, including milk, cereal, yogurt, and orange juice. Vitamin D doesn\u2019t often occur naturally in many foods, but it does in eggs and oily fish like salmon, tuna, and mackerel \u2014 so pack your diet with these fatty fish. A 3-ounce fillet of sockeye salmon contains about 450 international units (IUs) of vitamin D, which is a large chunk of the daily recommended 600 IUs (the maximum is 4,000 IUs, since overdosing on Vitamin D can actually be bad for you). Other foods with Vitamin D include soy milk, beef liver, cheese, certain mushrooms, and egg yolks. Of course, it\u2019s not essential to eat these same foods every day; but if you can find ways to incorporate them into your diet more often during the winter months, you\u2019ll be naturally boosting your Vitamin D levels without having to buy expensive (and sometimes useless) supplements.\n\nBasking Under Vitamin D Lamps\n\nYou should avoid tanning beds if you can, since they are associated with a higher risk for skin cancer and exposure to dangerous UV rays. But tanning beds are one way to provide you with some extra vitamin D during winter months.\n\nFor the artificial light without the melanoma risk, turn instead to special Vitamin D lamps. The only FDA-approved Vitamin D lamp is known as the Sperti, which reportedly boosts your vitamin D levels within 1-5 minute sessions several times per week. The Sperti is quite expensive ($425), but it certainly eliminates the need to go out of your way to find sunshine in a far-off place.\n\nSupplements\n\nIf all else fails, you can complement your Vitamin D routine with some supplements \u2014 especially if you\u2019re older, living in the Northern hemisphere, or have had a history of being Vitamin D-deficient. But since the efficacy of many types of Vitamin D supplements is still debated \u2014 and several studies have claimed they don\u2019t do anything \u2014 it\u2019s better to trust the sources of sun and food instead. And soon enough, summer will arrive and you can go back to your 15 minutes of daily sun-tanning to get your needed Vitamin D fix.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "vitamin d", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Vitamin D can be difficult to find in the winter, especially when the sun is weak and the weather cold.", "title": "How To Maintain Healthy Levels Of Vitamin D When It\u2019s Too Cold Outside", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/avoid-vitamin-d-deficiency-winter-bits-sunshine-and-proper-diet-322232", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/14/sunshine_0.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Vitamin D can be difficult to find in the winter, especially when the sun is weak and the weather cold.", "title": "How To Maintain Healthy Levels Of Vitamin D When It\u2019s Too Cold Outside", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/avoid-vitamin-d-deficiency-winter-bits-sunshine-and-proper-diet-322232", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/14/sunshine_0.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2015/02/14/sunshine_0.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474, "pages": 189874081082249}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Vitality", "published_time": "2015-02-14T17:01:16-05:00", "modified_time": "2015-02-14T17:07:29-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Vitamin D can be difficult to find in the winter, especially when the sun is weak and the weather cold."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb33a\"", "article_summary": "The only FDA-approved Vitamin D lamp is known as the Sperti, which reportedly boosts your vitamin D levels within 1-5 minute sessions several times per week.\nVitamin D, known as the \u201csunshine vitamin,\u201d is essential to maintaining our health and immune systems, and our main source is from the sun.\nVitamin D-Fortified DietCertain foods are fortified with Vitamin D, including milk, cereal, yogurt, and orange juice.\nAnd soon enough, summer will arrive and you can go back to your 15 minutes of daily sun-tanning to get your needed Vitamin D fix.\nStudies have shown that vitamin D deficiencies can lead to a slew of health problems and contribute to chronic disorders, including osteoporosis, depression, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension."}
