On the foreign policy side, it happens the best of these questions are posed by non-Americans, for the simple reason most Americans are not ready to think clearly about our moment and how we have come to it. We do not ask because we cannot answer.\n\nMy three favorite questions of late, it also happens, have to do with Syria. And let there be no doubt: It is all over for the Obama administration, the Pentagon, the spooks and all others still pretending there is a \u201cmoderate opposition\u201d that will carry the day in the many-sided Syrian conflict. Washington has slipped its grip. Others are in charge now, and as they pursue a solution to this crisis the only choice open to the U.S. is whether or not to join in the effort. It will be interesting to see which alternative the White House and the State Department choose.\n\n\u201cI cannot help asking those who have caused the situation, Do you realize now what you\u2019ve done?\u201d This is the first good question.\n\nVladimir Putin posed it in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly 10 days ago. Sensibly, the Russian president added, \u201cBut I am afraid no one is going to answer that.\u201d To offer modest assistance, Mr. Putin, the U.S. leadership knows exactly what it has done, and this is why you are correct: Your query will go without reply.\n\nThe second and third good questions came from Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister. For my money Zarif is among the ablest diplomats now on the scene. He addressed the U.S. on the Syria crisis during a conference in New York on Monday, and he asked, \u201cWhy are you there? Who gave you the right to be there?\u201d\n\nWow, wow and wow.\n\nI love these questions. The subtext in the three of them together is that the Obama administration\u2019s failure in Syria is now complete. Washington is no longer in charge. If there is a better example of language as power, I cannot think of what it is.\n\nPutin forces us to consider the Syria crisis as history. This is the equivalent of dropping a neutron bomb on our nation\u2019s capital: All the Greek facades are intact, but the narrative incessantly spun behind them is dead. Read Putin\u2019s U.N. speech here. Read a few others and you recognize that the Russian leader has long understood history\u2019s potency, especially when deployed against the messes resulting from America\u2019s imperial adventures.\n\nAs to Zarif\u2019s line of inquiry, both parts are of interest. To ask why the U.S. is in Syria is to brush aside all the customary bunkum about Washington\u2019s humane outrage over the Assad regime\u2019s brutalities. Underneath we find an obsession with \u201cregime change\u201d in Damascus so as to convert Syria from outlier to another Middle Eastern client. Left to the U.S., Assad\u2019s successor, as in the case of al-Sisi in Egypt, would be welcome to all the brutalities he may find necessary. Almost certainly he would enjoy an arms package similar to Egypt\u2019s now-restored $5 billion annually\u2014most of which is now deployed against Egyptians.\n\n\u201cWho gave you the right to be there?\u201d What a simple, pithy question. I have not heard any American other than people such as Noam Chomsky ever consider such a thing. Throughout Washington\u2019s long effort to arm anti-Assad militias on the ground and more recently to drop bombs on Syrian soil\u2014roughly 4,000 sorties to date\u2014the illegality of U.S. policy simply never comes up.\n\nZarif thus forces two bitter truths upon us. One, we have been breaking the law from the first. We may not have anything to say about this, as we have not to date, but the silence will be conspicuous from here on out, given that others are now prepared openly to challenge the U.S. on the point. Two, whatever one may think of the Assad government, those now committed to backing it as part of their strategy to defeat radical Islamists in Syria do so in accordance with international law. Like it or not, this counts.\n\nSpeaking strictly for myself, I like the idea of a global community that proceeds lawfully. It tends to reduce the incidence of disorder and anarchy created by such entities as the Islamic State and the Pentagon.\n\n*\n\nIt is now several weeks since Russia let it be known that it would reinforce its long-standing support of Bashar al-Assad with new military commitments. First came the materi\u00e9l. Bombing runs began a week ago. On Monday, a senior military official in Moscow announced that Russian troops are to join the fight against the Islamic State.\n\nWe are always encouraged to find anything Putin does devious and the outcome of hidden motives and some obscure agenda having to do with his pouting ambition to be seen as a first-rank world leader. From the government-supervised New York Times on down, this is what you read in the newspapers and hear on the radio and television broadcasts. I urge readers to pay no attention to this stuff. It is all about Washington\u2019s agenda to obscure.\n\nRussia\u2019s favored strategy in Syria has long been very clear. It is a question of distinguishing the primary and secondary contradictions, as the Marxists say. The Assad regime is to be kept in place so as to preserve those political institutions still functioning as the basis of a reconstructed national government. Once the threat of Islamic terror is defeated, a political transition into a post-Assad reconstruction can be negotiated.\n\nFor a time it appeared that Washington was prepared to buy into this set of expedients. This impression derived from the very frequent contacts between John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, with whom the American secretary of state has often worked closely.\n\nThen came the fateful encounter between Obama and Putin at the U.N. Obama spoke first, Putin afterward. Then the two met privately.\n\nA few days ago a source in Moscow with good lines into Kremlin thinking wrote a long note on the Obama-Putin encounter in New York. Here is some of what this source said:\n\nThe meeting with Obama in New York did not go well. It was extremely contentious, and Obama did not engage. Putin made the case that the important first priority had to be to eliminate Daesh [the Islamic State], and that after more than a year of the U.S. campaign there has been no significant success. Indeed, the contrary is the case. Putin\u2019s point was that air power alone will not succeed, and that now the only real boots on the ground are the Kurds and the armies of Syria and its supporters\u2014Hezbollah and some Iranians, but the Iranians troops involved in the struggle with Daesh are operating mostly in Iraq. Putin proposed creating a coalition, the equivalent of the anti-Hitler alliance, to focus on Daesh, and then focusing in Round 2 on the transition of Syria into a form of decentralized federation of highly autonomous regions\u2014Kurdish, Sunni, Alawite-Christian and a few others\u2014which all work together now. Putin had been led to believe through the Lavrov /Kerry channel\u2026 that there would be a broader agreement to work together. So he was surprised that Obama did not seize the opportunity to engage the battle in a coordinated way\u2026. In the end they agreed only on coordination between the two militaries to avoid running into each other. Putin left New York with the view that it is now much more important to support the government in Syria than he had thought before he went, because he came convinced that the U.S., left to its present course, is going to create another Libya, this time in Syria. Israel has a similar view, as does Egypt, Iran, and, increasingly, countries in Europe. With Daesh already so deeply implanted, this would lead to vast crisis\u2014military, political, economic, humanitarian\u2014that would spread across all of the Middle East, into the Caucasus and across North Africa, with millions of refugees\u2026.", "article_metadata": {"description": "\"Do you realize now what you've done?\" The best question about our Middle East disasters actually comes from Putin", "title": "Thomas Friedman, read your Chomsky: The New York Times gets Putin/Obama all wrong, again", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "\"Do you realize now what you've done?\" The best question about our Middle East disasters actually comes from Putin", "title": "Thomas Friedman, read your Chomsky: The New York Times gets Putin/Obama all wrong, again", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/06/thomas_friedman_read_your_chomsky_the_new_york_times_gets_putinobama_all_wrong_again/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/friedman_chomsky.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Do you realize now what you've done?\" The best question about our Middle East disasters actually comes from Putin", "title": "Thomas Friedman, read your Chomsky: The New York Times gets Putin/Obama all wrong, again", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/10/friedman_chomsky.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Patrick L.
