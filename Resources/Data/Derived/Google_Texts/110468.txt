Republican U.S. Senate candidate Joni Ernst launched her first television ad of the campaign. The tongue-in-cheek spot, entitled “Squeal”, makes the analogy between Ernst’s experience castrating hogs while growing up on an Iowa farm to her goals of “cutting pork” in Washington, D.C.

The 30-second ad is running on cable TV in the Des Moines market, with plans to expand to other areas in the coming weeks, Ernst spokesman Derek Flowers told TheIowaRepublican.com.

Here is a look at the commericial:

The full script of the ad:

Joni: I’m Joni Ernst. I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm. So when I get to Washington, I’ll know how to cut pork. VO: Joni Ernst. Mother, soldier, conservative. Joni: My parents taught us to live within our means. It’s time to force Washington to do the same; to cut wasteful spending, repeal Obamacare, and balance the budget. I’m Joni Ernst and I approve this message because Washington’s full of big spenders. Let’s make ’em squeal.

Ernst says she will take on big spenders, like Democrat U.S. Senate candidate Bruce Braley, in Washington.

“As a mother, I want to make sure that we pass along to my daughter and her generation the same great nation we inherited. To do that, we will have to get Washington to stop borrowing .40 cents out of every dollar our government spends, and repeal and replace Bruce Braley’s Obamacare with common-sense, market-driven solutions,” said Ernst.
