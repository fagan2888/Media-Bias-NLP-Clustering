I think he (Upton) was trying to take advantage of that,\u201d said David Moore, a lobbyist for the Association of American Medical Colleges.\n\nAnother potential obstacle is a basic philosophical disagreement between Democrats and Republicans on how to spur innovation.\n\nIs it more effective to reduce regulatory requirements on drug companies and medical researchers? Or should lawmakers increase the funding of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health?\n\nThe DeGette-Upton initiative seeks to do some of both, but the specifics of that balancing act could prove troubling. Already, Pallone has complained that the effort does not \u201cinclude any real dollars to fund additional basic research\u201d at NIH.\n\nBut if Upton and DeGette were to steer more money toward NIH, it could invite opposition from Tea Party conservatives.\n\nTo underscore the tension, a draft of the bill mentions new NIH funding but does not cite a specific dollar figure, according to aides.\n\nAlso included: one initiative that would make it easier for medical researchers to share data, and another provision that would create new incentives for drug companies to develop cures for \u201ccomplex diseases\u201d such as Alzheimer\u2019s.\n\nFor his part, Upton has remained positive.\n\n\u201cDiana and I are still meeting with patients and experts, seeking feedback as we continue working together on legislative language,\u201d he said. \u201cWe both look forward to being able to say at the end of the year that, together, we got the job done.\u201d\n\nYet even success has its pitfalls. With so few bills moving through Congress nowadays, a measure that shows some promise of passage has the potential of becoming a magnet for every lawmaker\u2019s pet project.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a risk that a lot of special interests will jump on the only moving (legislative) vehicle and slip in a lot of riders,\u201d said Nandini Gopinadh, a policy analyst with the Alliance for Natural Health USA. \u201cWe have to be really watchful of this legislation \u2026. that\u2019s the danger with bills that are this dense.\u201d\n\nIn particular, her organization has raised concerns that the effort ultimately could become a \u201cgift\u201d to the brand names of the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nThe fears are not without merit.\n\nAmong all U.S. industries, the biggest donors to DeGette and Upton in the last two years have come from the pharmaceutical and health field, according to the Center of Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan campaign watchdog.\n\nThese donations totaled more than $216,000 for DeGette and about $622,000 for Upton, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee.\n\nAsked about the contributions, DeGette simply said that \u201cjust because they gave me a campaign check doesn\u2019t mean they have my vote.\u201d\n\nAmanda Jezek, a lobbyist with the Infectious Diseases Society of America, cited one section of the draft as proof that Upton and DeGette were trying to spur the pharmaceutical industry without giving away too much.\n\nThat provision tries to prod the pharmaceutical industry into developing new antibiotics. Because these medications are not as profitable as so-called \u201cdesigner drugs,\u201d the bill would allow pharmaceutical companies to find their profits another way. In exchange of developing the antibiotics, pharmaceutical companies could transfer the exclusive rights for that drug to another, more profitable medication \u2014 a nice payday for the industry.\n\nHowever, as a safeguard, the companies also would be required to make a donation to the NIH.\n\n\u201cThere is definitely a strong interest from the committee to try to strike the right balance,\u201d Jezek said.\n\nOne expert who helped inform the bill in its early stages was Dr. Dan Theodorescu, director of the University of Colorado Cancer Center at the Anschutz Medical Campus.\n\nHe spoke at one of the roundtables last year and spoke highly of the bill\u2019s push to develop a clearinghouse for medical data that researchers nationwide could access.\n\n\u201cThe richness and the power of this (database), when we have millions of patients (in it), would be huge,\u201d he said.\n\nHe called the effort a \u201cgood beginning\u201d that was essential to the long-term success of the U.S. \u2014 both medically and economically.\n\n\u201cI really firmly believe that the country that gets a grasp on bio-medicine is going to be the country that leads the world in science over the next 50 to 100 years,\u201d he said.\n\nMark K.
