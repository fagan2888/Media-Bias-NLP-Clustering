The FBI and Federal Protective Service are investigating.\n\nThe package was opened in a small room in the building about noon. The building was evacuated as federal and local law enforcement arrived, including hazmat crews. Some 70 people were in the building when the package was opened, French said, many of whom were later quarantined.\n\nAlicia Delgado arrived at the building at 10 a.m. and was quarantined for roughly six hours as officials investigated the package.
