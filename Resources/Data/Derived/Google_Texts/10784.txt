Flexibility is touted as the end-goal for a competitive economy but the reality isn’t as pretty as the theory as government meddling has killed incentives to hire employees permanently.

Obamacare and uncertainty has accelerated a huge shift to temp agencies, the WSJ reports today. More than one-tenth of all job growth since 2009 has been temporary and temp hiring is becoming a core part of businesses rather than a short-term solution in a questionable economy.

The problem for the economy is that uncertainty breeds more uncertainty. In a consumer-driven economy it’s a viscous cycle. Businesses are uncertain so they don’t hire permanent employees; employees are uncertain about income so they don’t spend.

“We do not see this as an indicator that we are at a ‘peak’ economy,” said Jeffrey A. Joerres, chief executive of ManpowerGroup, one of the country’s largest staffing firms. “We rather see it as more of a structural or secular change, that our industry will be absorbing more of the workforce than it did in the past.”

The thing is, temp hiring is terribly inefficient. Companies like Manpower take a large part of the compensation. Simply put, the value of being able to fire a worker is more coveted than the extra cost of hiring temps.

For me, the solution is to make it much easier to hire and fire employees. It’s painful but it’s an incentive for employees to work harder and would mean they collect 100% of the compensation for labor. In exchange, the government needs to provide re-training and benefits for fired workers. Denmark has moved to that model with some success.
