Pentobarbital is commonly used to relieve stress before surgery, but when combined with other drugs or given in high doses, it can become deadly. For the past two years the sedative has been the lethal injection drug of choice in American executions. The drug, which is mostly made overseas, has been running out in states across the country.\n\n\"The states really scramble to go all over to get drugs. Some went overseas, some got from each other. But these manufacturers, a number them are based in Europe, don't want to participate in our executions. So they've clamped down as much as they can,\" said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center.\n\nAfter running out of pentobarbital in September, the Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation and Correction announced a new policy that would impose a two-drug lethal injection process for its executions. The process involves the sedative midazolam and the painkiller hydromorphone.\n\nPhillips, who would be the first to be executed under the new process, challenged it in federal court. His lawyers say that the new lethal cocktail may be cruel and unusual punishment, which would violate Philips constitutional rights under the eighth amendment.\n\nIn his video testimony, Phillips said that God is protecting him from execution because doctors who came to do a preliminary checkup were unable to find his veins.\n\n\"I guess the Lord hid my veins from them,\" Phillips said.\n\nThe new execution drugs cause severe side effects including pain and vomiting, which are not usually present in executions using pentobarbital. Dr. Mark Dershwitz, a University of Massachusetts anesthesiologist says that the drug cocktail will cause Phillips to stop breathing, then irreversible brain and heart damage will follow.\n\nNo word yet on whether the state will postpone Phillips\u2019 execution. The state did say that the use of the drugs has been repeatedly challenged to no avail.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "ohio death row inmate", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Ohio death row inmate Ronald Phillips says that the state's proposed lethal injection drug combo is cruel and unusual punishment.", "title": "Ohio Death Row Inmate: 'The Lord Hid My Veins' From Prison Doctor", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ohio-death-row-inmate-says-prison-doctor-couldnt-find-his-veins-testifies-against-new-execution", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/03/48574624157937bb23az.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ohio death row inmate Ronald Phillips says that the state's proposed lethal injection drug combo is cruel and unusual punishment.", "title": "Ohio Death Row Inmate: 'The Lord Hid My Veins' From Prison Doctor", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/ohio-death-row-inmate-says-prison-doctor-couldnt-find-his-veins-testifies-against-new-execution", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/03/48574624157937bb23az.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2013/11/03/48574624157937bb23az.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Policy/Biz", "published_time": "2013-11-03T10:32:59-05:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-03T10:32:58-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Ohio death row inmate Ronald Phillips says that the state's proposed lethal injection drug combo is cruel and unusual punishment."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf0b8\"", "article_summary": "Ohio used its last dose of the more widely used lethal injection drug pentobarbital to execute convicted murderer Harry Mitts, Jr. this past September.\nof Rehabilitation and Correction announced a new policy that would impose a two-drug lethal injection process for its executions.\nFor the past two years the sedative has been the lethal injection drug of choice in American executions.\nNo word yet on whether the state will postpone Phillips\u2019 execution.\nThe new execution drugs cause severe side effects including pain and vomiting, which are not usually present in executions using pentobarbital."}
