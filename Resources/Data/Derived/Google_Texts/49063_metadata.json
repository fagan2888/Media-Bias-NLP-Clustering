Roxie Hunt, a Seattle stylist at Vain, unofficially spearheaded the movement after curiosity led her to experiment by dyeing her coworker Rain\u2019s armpits a bright and vibrant blue to match her hair color. She's written about her experience on a blog post, which has garnered over 30,000 shares, and even inspired the Instagram hashtag #dyedpits \u2014 that, however, has less than 30 posts. Nevertheless, this is a movement people are definitely noticing.\n\nRain poses with bright blue dyed armpit hair. howtohairgirl/Instagram\n\n\u201cIt's no secret that some of us choose not to shave or wax our pits. More and more often, I am meeting women who unapologetically choose not to succumb to the societal pressure of scraping a razor against the soft skin of their bodies. If you recall, I want to celebrate pit hair,\u201d Hunt wrote on her blog.\n\nThe Seattle stylist went on to describe the process. \u201cI began by mixing bleach and 30 volume developer. I knew I needed something strong enough to cut through that coarse hair and lighten it up as much as possible, but I didn't want to use 40 volume because I didn't want to cause any uncomfortable burning on the delicate skin in her pits.\u201d After Rain wiped her pits down to remove any deodorant, Hunt got right in there with her bleach and color brush, \u201capplying it thick in small sweeping strokes in all directions, making sure to fully cover every hair.\u201d\n\nOther women, like Hunt and Rain, have begun to embrace this new trend including Destiny M, a YouTube user, who made a video explaining her decision to dye her armpit hair bright blue after spending years of trying to hide her body hair. \u201c[Growing out your hair] is so empowering. As a young girl, you are always told, hairless is beauty, it's perfection. But when you go against the grain like that... it's so empowering. I really recommend you try it,\u201d she said in the video.\n\nNot shaving one\u2019s armpit air has been considered revolting, and warrants feelings of disgust not just from the media but from other women. A 2013 study published in the journal Psychology of Women Quarterly found women considered shaving a minor inconvenience and a personal choice, but the idea of body hair was revolting. Moreover, when female college students were asked to grow their armpit and leg hair for ten weeks and keep a journal about it, the participants wrote boyfriends and mothers were not supportive. The women felt or were told they were gross, disgusting, unclean, sloppy, and \u201cew.\u201d\n\nI did an experiment to see how it would look if I grew in my armpit hair and dyed it to match my head pic.twitter.com/XuYyAsBCSQ \u2014 'Cardigans' Kitty (@KittyKnits) November 2, 2014\n\nIn April, London-based photographer Ben Hopper sought to protest sexist norms by recruiting dozens of models, actresses, designers, and friends to grow out their body hair as part of his Natural Beauty Series. \u201cThe whole point is contrast between fashionable female beauty and the raw unconventional look of female armpit hair,\u201d Hopper said. The standards of beauty are so ingrained in people\u2019s consciousness that seeing women\u2019s body hair yields a \u201cgrossed-out\u201d response.\n\nDyeing armpit hair makes a bright and bold statement against the preconceived notions and comes with several benefits. Growing your armpit hair keeps sweat away from the skin and helps to prevent over-heating of the lymph nodes under the armpits. It also acts as a human fragrance diffuser that allows one\u2019s personal scent to intoxicate their environment. A 2007 study published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine found the development of hair in regions such as the armpits is thought to facilitate the release of sex pheromones in sexually mature humans. This helps announce one\u2019s presence and fertility to potential mates.\n\nWhile the argument for not shaving is tied to smell being crucial to mating, dyeing your armpits does come with a risk. A 2001 study published in the International Journal of Cancer found women who regularly use permanent hair dye may be putting themselves at an increased risk for bladder cancer. Women who used permanent hair dye at least once a month were twice as likely to develop bladder cancer compared to women who did not use permanent hair dye. The amount of dye used is also an important factor when it comes to risk, as dark-colored hair needs more coloring than blonde.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "armpit hair, beauty trend, beauty standards, body hair, hair removal, sweat glands, lymph glands, sex pheromones, fertility, women's health", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Here\u2019s what you need to know before you raise your arms up and dye your armpit hair.", "title": "The Ups And Downs Of Dyeing Your Armpit Hair [PHOTOS & VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/want-dye-your-armpit-hair-what-you-need-know-first-312588", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/01/armpit-hair.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here\u2019s what you need to know before you raise your arms up and dye your armpit hair.", "title": "The Ups And Downs Of Dyeing Your Armpit Hair [PHOTOS & VIDEO]", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/want-dye-your-armpit-hair-what-you-need-know-first-312588", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/01/armpit-hair.png", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/12/01/armpit-hair.png"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "The Grapevine", "published_time": "2014-12-01T13:03:06-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-01T13:03:05-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Here\u2019s what you need to know before you raise your arms up and dye your armpit hair."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe0498\"", "article_summary": "Women who used permanent hair dye at least once a month were twice as likely to develop bladder cancer compared to women who did not use permanent hair dye.\nWomen across the country are raising their arms high, and reaching for a box of hair dye, in a new and bizarre beauty trend: dyed armpit hair.\n\u201cThe whole point is contrast between fashionable female beauty and the raw unconventional look of female armpit hair,\u201d Hopper said.\nDyeing armpit hair makes a bright and bold statement against the preconceived notions and comes with several benefits.\nGrowing your armpit hair keeps sweat away from the skin and helps to prevent over-heating of the lymph nodes under the armpits."}
