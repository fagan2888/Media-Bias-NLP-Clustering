Ted Cruz (R-Texas) speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill after his speech in Washington, Sept. 25, 2013. (Photo: Gabriella Demczuk / The New York Times)\n\nThere is a desire felt by tens of millions of Americans, lumped into a diffuse and fractious movement known as the Christian right, to destroy the intellectual and scientific rigor of the Enlightenment, radically diminish the role of government to create a theocratic state based on \u201cbiblical law,\u201d and force a recalcitrant world to bend to the will of an imperial and \u201cChristian\u201d America. Its public face is on display in the House of Representatives. This ideology, which is the driving force behind the shutdown of the government, calls for the eradication of social \u201cdeviants,\u201d beginning with gay men and lesbians, whose sexual orientation, those in the movement say, is a curse and an illness, contaminating the American family and the country. Once these \u201cdeviants\u201d are removed, other \u201cdeviants,\u201d including Muslims, liberals, feminists, intellectuals, left-wing activists, undocumented workers, poor African-Americans and those dismissed as \u201cnominal Christians\u201d\u2014meaning Christians who do not embrace this peculiar interpretation of the Bible\u2014will also be ruthlessly repressed. The \u201cdeviant\u201d government bureaucrats, the \u201cdeviant\u201d media, the \u201cdeviant\u201d schools and the \u201cdeviant\u201d churches, all agents of Satan, will be crushed or radically reformed. The rights of these \u201cdeviants\u201d will be annulled. \u201cChristian values\u201d and \u201cfamily values\u201d will, in the new state, be propagated by all institutions. Education and social welfare will be handed over to the church. Facts and self-criticism will be replaced with relentless indoctrination.\n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz\u2014whose father is Rafael Cruz, a rabid right-wing Christian preacher and the director of the Purifying Fire International ministry\u2014and legions of the senator\u2019s wealthy supporters, some of whom orchestrated the shutdown, are rooted in a radical Christian ideology known as Dominionism or Christian Reconstructionism. This ideology calls on anointed \u201cChristian\u201d leaders to take over the state and make the goals and laws of the nation \u201cbiblical.\u201d It seeks to reduce government to organizing little more than defense, internal security and the protection of property rights. It fuses with the Christian religion the iconography and language of American imperialism and nationalism, along with the cruelest aspects of corporate capitalism. The intellectual and moral hollowness of the ideology, its flagrant distortion and misuse of the Bible, the contradictions that abound within it\u2014its leaders champion small government and a large military, as if the military is not part of government\u2014and its laughable pseudoscience are impervious to reason and fact. And that is why the movement is dangerous.\n\nThe cult of masculinity, as in all fascist movements, pervades the ideology of the Christian right. The movement uses religion to sanctify military and heroic \u201cvirtues,\u201d glorify blind obedience and order over reason and conscience, and pander to the euphoria of collective emotions. Feminism and homosexuality, believers are told, have rendered the American male physically and spiritually impotent. Jesus, for the Christian right, is a man of action, casting out demons, battling the Antichrist, attacking hypocrites and ultimately slaying nonbelievers. This cult of masculinity, with its glorification of violence, is appealing to the powerless. It stokes the anger of many Americans, mostly white and economically disadvantaged, and encourages them to lash back at those who, they are told, seek to destroy them. The paranoia about the outside world is fostered by bizarre conspiracy theories, many of which are prominent in the rhetoric of those leading the government shutdown. Believers, especially now, are called to a perpetual state of war with the \u201csecular humanist\u201d state. The march, they believe, is irreversible. Global war, even nuclear war, is the joyful harbinger of the Second Coming. And leading the avenging armies is an angry, violent Messiah who dooms billions of apostates to death.\n\nTed Cruz said in the Senate last month during a 21-hour speech that he gave in an attempt to block the funding of Obamacare, \u201cIt is disheartening to know that the nation our forefathers built is no longer of importance to our president and his Democratic counterparts. Not only that, we are falling away from core Christian values. I don\u2019t know about you, but I believe in the Jesus who died to save himself, not enable lazy followers to be dependent on him. He didn\u2019t walk around all willy-nilly just passing out free health care to those who were sick, or food to those who were hungry, or clothes to those in need. No, he said get up, brush yourself off, go into town and get a job, and as he hung on the cross he said, \u2018I died so that I may live in eternity with my Father. If you want to join us you can die for yourself and your own sins. What do I look like, your savior or something?\u2019 That\u2019s the Jesus I want to see brought back into our core values as a nation. That\u2019s why we need to repeal Obamacare.\u201d\n\nDominionists believe they are engaged in an epic battle against the forces of Satan. They live in a binary world of black and white. They feel they are victims, surrounded by sinister groups bent on their destruction. They have anointed themselves as agents of God who alone know God\u2019s will. They sanctify their rage. This rage lies at the center of the ideology. It leaves them sputtering inanities about Barack Obama, his corporate-sponsored health care reform bill, his alleged mandated suicide counseling or \u201cdeath panels\u201d for seniors under the bill, his supposed secret alliance with radical Muslims, and \u201ccreeping socialism.\u201d They see the government bureaucracy as being controlled by \u201csecular humanists\u201d who want to destroy the family and make war against the purity of their belief system. They seek total cultural and political domination.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/templates/ja_teline_iv_t3/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "While the radical religious right wants to lead a world based on conservative values, in reality it has no interest in promoting actual social values.", "title": "The Radical Christian Right and the War on Government", "og": {"site_name": "Truthout", "description": "While the radical religious right wants to lead a world based on conservative values, in reality it has no interest in promoting actual social values.", "title": "The Radical Christian Right and the War on Government", "url": "http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/19264-the-radical-christian-right-and-the-war-on-government", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2013_10/2013_1007c_.jpg", "type": "non_profit"}, "twitter": {"description": "While the radical religious right wants to lead a world based on conservative values, in reality it has no interest in promoting actual social values.", "creator": "@truthout", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/images/images_2013_10/2013_1007c_.jpg", "title": "The Radical Christian Right and the War on Government", "site": "@truthout", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 286391544774433}, "author": "Ariel", "keywords": "barack obama. chris hedges, democracy, environment, government, government shutdown, health care, law, military ,politics, religion, senate shutdown speech, ted cruz,", "google-site-verification": "EfgVxcdUDBF_Dd81ZBBw_J8FuRjGnvp9r2JAM9IhvUk", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd8f9\"", "article_summary": "\u201cChristian values\u201d and \u201cfamily values\u201d will, in the new state, be propagated by all institutions.\nNot only that, we are falling away from core Christian values.\nU.S. Sen.
