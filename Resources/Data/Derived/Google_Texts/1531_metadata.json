Not too well, if your latest projects are any indication.\n\nOf course, there was only so much we could really expect from a party who literally had to hold classes to teach their candidates how not to say, \u201cwomen who are pregnant by rape should be forced to give birth\u201d (oh, they still believe it, it\u2019s just to make sure they don\u2019t say it like that). When you have to actually be \u201cschooled\u201d on how to talk to female voters, outreach was always going to be a bit outside of the party\u2019s comfort zone.\n\nThe newest efforts, though? Well, they aren\u2019t going so well. In an attempt to prove that they are pro-women, the GOP is talking to them the only way they know how \u2014 by belittling them.\n\nThat\u2019s the only explanation behind a new website in Texas called \u201cFemale Fact(her).\u201d The name, presumably, comes from the idea that women somehow have a different set of facts than men, or maybe that they do have the same facts but they have to learn them in a different, more gentle way, because ladybrains? Whatever the reason that the GOP decided to create female-centric \u201cfacts,\u201d the truth is they really, well, aren\u2019t the truth at all.\n\n\u201cThe website is a laughable attempt to appropriate some selected successes of feminism \u2014 for example, better educational opportunities for women, and workplace advancements that have allowed a very few of them to rise to the highest echelons of the business world and attribute them to the Republican politicians who have dominated Texas politics over the last 20 years,\u201dreports Texas journalist Andrea Grimes. \u201cIn doing so, the campaign is apparently trying to unite all the Texas womenfolk who\u2019ve been oppressed by Obamacare\u2019s affordable birth control, who long to carry their assault rifles to Target.\u201d\n\n\u201cLaughable\u201d is exactly the right word, too. Starting with the fact that the Texas GOP couldn\u2019t come up with enough topics to even talk to women about, and were forced to duplicate three of them in their logo to look like they had more talking points (apparently there were no facts on, say the environment, daycare, parental leave, early childhood education or retirement to share), the site is rife with deception. They tout the need for more women in higher level executive work roles while ignoring the factors like family leave or equal pay that keep them from attaining those levels in the office, or discuss how health care costs allegedly go up for women over age 55 due to the Affordable Care Act but neglect to mention the ways it decreased for many under that age because of the end of charging women more then men in insurance plans simply because they are female.\n\nTalking down to women isn\u2019t just a Texas GOP thing. Nationally conservatives think the best way to get through to women voters is to explain how voting for Democrats is bad by comparing them to a bad relationship. That\u2019s the gist of a new ad out from Americans for Shared Prosperity, which depicts a woman bemoaning how awful her boyfriend is because, \u201cHe\u2019s in my emails, text messages, spying on me, but ignoring real threats \u2014 He thinks the only thing I care about is free birth control, but he won\u2019t even let me keep my own doctor.\u201d The \u201cboyfriend,\u201d of course, is President Barack Obama, and the ad claims that \u201cI know I\u2019m stuck with Barack for two more years, but I\u2019m not stuck with his friends,\u201d apparently meant to encourage women to vote out Obama allies in the midterm.\n\nOf course, there are a myriad of issues with this message, starting with the GOP\u2019s offensive underlying statement that women in bad relationships should wait it out and do whatever they can to make it slightly more pleasant in the meantime. But that\u2019s expected from a party that thinks that women can\u2019t understand complex issues unless they are presented as a dating game. \u201cReducing the relationship women have with the government and the president to a dating relationship when we\u2019re talking about serious policy issues, I think these women voters feel they have a more complex relationship, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s really being understood,\u201d Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP) at Rutgers, told MSNBC.com.\n\nWith just six weeks until election day, the GOP really needs to figure out its relationship with women if it wants to win their votes. So far, these cutesy outreach tricks aren\u2019t cutting it.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "/templates/ja_teline_iv_t3/images/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Truthout sparks action by revealing systemic injustice and providing a platform for transformative ideas through investigative reporting and analysis.", "title": "The GOP Continues Its Condescending Outreach to Female Voters", "og": {"site_name": "Truthout", "description": "Talking down to women isn't just a Texas GOP thing.", "title": "The GOP Continues Its Condescending Outreach to Female Voters", "url": "http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/26424-the-gop-continues-its-condescending-outreach-to-female-voters", "image": "http://www.truth-out.org/tologo.jpg", "type": "non_profit"}, "twitter": {"creator": "@truthout", "site": "@truthout", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The GOP Continues Its Condescending Outreach to Female Voters"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "fb": {"app_id": 286391544774433}, "author": "Robin Marty", "keywords": "Truthout, truth-out, truth out, independent news, nonprofit news, ad free news, progressive news, investigative reporting, critical analysis, BuzzFlash, headlines, commentary, fracking, Guantanamo, mass incarceration, prisons, new economy, police militarization, climate change", "google-site-verification": "EfgVxcdUDBF_Dd81ZBBw_J8FuRjGnvp9r2JAM9IhvUk", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "YES", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdefb2\"", "article_summary": "With just six weeks until election day, the GOP really needs to figure out its relationship with women if it wants to win their votes.\nTalking down to women isn\u2019t just a Texas GOP thing.\nWhen you have to actually be \u201cschooled\u201d on how to talk to female voters, outreach was always going to be a bit outside of the party\u2019s comfort zone.\nIn an attempt to prove that they are pro-women, the GOP is talking to them the only way they know how \u2014 by belittling them.\nNationally conservatives think the best way to get through to women voters is to explain how voting for Democrats is bad by comparing them to a bad relationship."}
