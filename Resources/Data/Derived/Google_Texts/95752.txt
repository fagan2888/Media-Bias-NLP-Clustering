It’s Valentine’s Day in Springfield and that means “The Simpsons” is giving everyone a little love — even Professor Frink (Hank Azaria).

In the Feb. 14 episode, “Love Is in the N2-O2-Ar-CO2-Ne-He-CH4,” Springfield’s resident scientist has a plan. An official description for the episode reads, “Lonely Professor Frink uses science to turn himself into a man whom women find attractive. But, overwhelmed by the attention, he invents an algorithm to perfectly pair the lonely men and women of Springfield, realizing that scientific exploration is his true love.”

Before that though, he’s paying tribute to the movie “Ex Machina” with his very own humanoid robot to fall in love with in the Zap2it-exclusive sneak peek above. Of course, Frink quickly realizes the flaw in his plan when the robot’s mom shows up to question exactly what he’s doing with her daughter.

“Why did I build a mother?” he wonders.

“The Simpsons” airs Sundays at 8 p.m. ET/PT on FOX.
