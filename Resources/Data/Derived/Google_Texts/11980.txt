Mitchell, SD

Davison County has joined the short list of South Dakota counties with an officer dedicated to courthouse security.



The county commission last year approved the additional full-time deputy position whose main duty is to provide security.



The county previously had a deputy in court only when there was a higher risk of trouble.



Josh Peterson was hired for the job and splits his time between the courthouse in Mitchell and the public safety center where the sheriff's office is based.



He says unforeseen benefits of the position include keeping people who are drunk from entering and checking for active arrest warrants of people coming to court.



A 2013 statewide survey found that only Minnehaha, Lincoln and Pennington counties had full-time security officers.
