Congratulations on your landslide into a second term, Gov. Bentley. Now it's time to stop the Alabama job growth mudslide.

Quit fighting Obama. Start fixing Alabama.

The economy is booming in the rest of the country while Alabama -- the state where anybody who can utter the words "I'll fight Obama" can win an election -- is 49th in job growth.

The good doctor claims healthcare was one of his priorities until the Obamacare confusion threw a monkey wrench into his plans. Bentley's only plan was to block Medicaid expansion, at the expense of 300,000 poor Alabamians who could use a break. Until you come up with a better plan to improve healthcare and create jobs, you are the monkey wrench, governor.

Pull that prescription pad out of your desk drawer. Quit fighting and start fixing. We've been hanging out in the waiting room for 4 years.

It's legacy time, Doc. Earn a paycheck.
