But in a noticeable pattern, state-run health exchanges managed by Deloitte Consulting emerged relatively unscathed from the experience, and more are turning to the company for help.\n\nFour states \u2014 Connecticut, Kentucky, Rhode Island and Washington State \u2014 relied on the company and enjoyed a relatively smooth rollout, while Maryland, Nevada, Minnesota and Oregon have enlisted Deloitte\u2019s services for an array of tasks.\n\nIt is all part of a technical and political shuffle unfolding between the close of the Obamacare\u2019s first sign-up period last month and the law\u2019s second go-round in November.\n\nSEE ALSO: Democrats dogged by Obamacare: Voters choose GOP, 41 to 34 percent\n\n\u201cI think that people are going to go to the technologies that have proven themselves to work as opposed to perhaps trying to save ones that were failures,\u201d Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, a Democrat, told the Center for American Progress last week.\n\nTwo of Deloitte\u2019s top health-reform officials \u2014 Pat Howard and Wade Horn \u2014 discussed their keys to success in a wide-ranging interview with The Washington Times.\n\nThe Deloitte executives said the company built on a decades-long track record of building self-service portals, particularly in field of Medicaid eligibility, allowed them walk into states with a game plan instead of a blank notebook.\n\nSEE ALSO: Ky. voters are more comfortable with \u2018Obamacare\u2019 when you call it \u2018kynect\u2019\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t just taking guesses about what might be helpful and what might work or might not work,\u201d said Mr. Horn, a director in Deloitte Consulting\u2019s public sector practice.\n\nManaging expectations in the program\u2019s rollout was also key.\n\nThe first open enrollment season arrived nearly four years after the law\u2019s passage, but the implementation window was much shorter. States had until after the 2012 presidential election to decide whether to set up their own exchange, and the bidding process for IT vendors ate up time as well.\n\n\u201cMost states were looking at a year, year and a half, to implement this,\u201d said Mr. Howard, principal in Deloitte Consulting\u2019s state health care practice. \u201cSo they had to be smart about what they put into the system in the first release, and what would go into subsequent releases.\u201d\n\nStates such as Kentucky, the only state in the South to both expand Medicaid and set up its own Obamacare exchanges, earned kudos by keeping things simple for its widely praised \u201ckynect\u201d website.\n\nGov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat, told The Washington Times in January the success of the state\u2019s exchange was the result of extensive testing and a clean website design that forsook bells and whistles in favor of convenience.\n\nIn the runup to launch, Deloitte used a system of \u201cbuckets\u201d for its exchanges. One bucket was for must-haves \u2014 the things necessary for a functioning, state-run marketplaces on Oct. 1 of last year. The second was for things \u201cthat we would like to do, the states wanted to do, but you didn\u2019t have enough time to get it done in the first open enrollment period,\u201d Mr. Howard said.\n\nIn the future, Deloitte and other vendors may look to live-chat functions and systems that link people with certain health conditions to the plans that, historically, have offered the best coverage for their needs.\n\nAlso critical was the partnership between the state and the vendor.\n\nThe way Mr. Horn tells it, when someone walked into the state agency setting up the health exchange, \u201cyou could not tell who was a Deloitte person and who was a state person.\u201d\n\nThings went wrong at times, he said, but there was no time to dillydally.\n\n\u201cNothing bogs down a technology project quicker than a process that doesn\u2019t allow for efficient decision-making,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were fortunate to have leadership at the states that understood that, and understood this was not a project [where] we were going to boil the ocean and debate every fine point forever, but rather we\u2019re going to make quick decisions and get an insurance exchange up in time for the first open enrollment period in order to best serve the citizens within those states.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Obamacare rollout last fall was a well-documented disaster in many places, leading states and the federal government to drop their contractors or withhold payment for their work.
