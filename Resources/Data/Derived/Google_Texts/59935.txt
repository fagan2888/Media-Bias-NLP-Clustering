The outgoing New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance Commissioner Ken Kobylowski will join AmeriHealth New Jersey as senior vice president of provider contracting and network operations effective July 13, according to AmeriHealth’s announcement last week.



AmeriHealth New Jersey, which consists of AmeriHealth HMO Inc. and AmeriHealth Insurance Company of New Jersey, provides health insurance coverage to employers and individuals throughout the Garden State. AmeriHealth New Jersey is based in Cranbury, New Jersey.

Kobylowski will remain in his current commissioner role until July 10, AmeriHealth New Jersey said. Kobylowski’s pending departure was first announced by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie’s administration on June 22. Christie said he plans to nominate Richard J. Badolato, a partner at law firm Connell Foley in Roseland, New Jersey, to succeed Kobylowski as the next commissioner of Banking and Insurance. Badolato is expected to begin his service on Aug. 1.

Upon joining AmeriHealth New Jersey, Kobylowski will have overall responsibility for AmeriHealth New Jersey’s Provider Relations, Provider Partnerships and Provider Contracting and Reimbursement.

Kobylowski will work to ensure that AmeriHealth New Jersey’s provider networks support the various product lines of the business, including consumer-directed products, ACO partnerships, tiered networks, pay-for-performance and shared-savings models, according to the announcement.

“We are very excited to have Ken join the AmeriHealth New Jersey executive leadership team,” said Judith L. Roman, president and CEO of AmeriHealth New Jersey. “Ken played a critical leadership role as Commissioner of the Department of Banking and Insurance in New Jersey during the historic implementation of the Affordable Care Act. His vast industry experience, coupled with his in-depth understanding of the New Jersey health care environment, will be an invaluable asset to our team.”

As commissioner, Kobylowski oversaw New Jersey’s banking, insurance and real estate industries. He has also held several leadership roles with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).

Kobylowski held several roles within the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance since he joined in 2010. He has served as commissioner since 2012. Prior to 2010, he was with Herrick, Feinstein, LLP, a New York-based law firm, for more than a decade.
