BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) — The Pittsburgh Pirates lost 95 games in 2005, the year they drafted outfielder Andrew McCutchen in the first round. Four years later, when McCutchen made his major league debut, they lost 99 games.

McCutchen has seen the franchise at its worst. As he has matured into one of the top players in the National League, the Pirates also have been on the upswing.

The Pirates got an NL wild-card berth in each of the past two seasons. This year, McCutchen wants more.

“We’re not here to try to win a wild-card game,” McCutchen said. “We’re here to win the division and keep going from there to win a championship.”

Such a statement would have drawn laughter not too long ago. McCutchen said perceptions about the Pirates have changed.

“People look at us a lot differently because they know we’re for real,” McCutchen said. “It would’ve been easy to say 2013 was a fluke and we just got lucky. But we showed up in ’14 and were able to do the same thing. We know we’re for real. And other teams know they just can’t come in (thinking), ‘All right, we’re going to beat the Pirates.’ We’re not that team anymore.”

The Pirates have a solid bullpen and a starting rotation topped by left-hander Francisco Liriano and right-hander Gerrit Cole. The infield includes veteran second baseman Neil Walker, who hit a career-best 23 homers, and third baseman Josh Harrison, who had a breakout season in 2014.

“We have a really good team,” McCutchen said. “And I believe the outfield will be our anchor.”

McCutchen is a three-time MVP finalist in center field. He’s flanked by Starling Marte in left and Gregory Polanco in right. All three of them can hit for power and a high average, have above-average speed and are very good defenders.
