It costs more than $440 million per year to operate \u2014 or about $3.8 million for each of the 116 detainees. U.S. officials say it\u2019s become a recruiting tool for terrorists, who use it to further justify attacks on U.S. targets. And it\u2019s a legal quandary. Some of the detainees have been determined to pose no threat to the U.S., and have been cleared for release for years. Others the administration considers too dangerous to free, but knows it also couldn\u2019t convict them in a proper trial.\n\nFailure to close Guantanamo would be a blow to Obama\u2019s legacy. But it would also leave the facility, and its remaining detainees, with an uncertain fate under the next administration. None of the current leading presidential candidates have committed to closing Guantanamo, although Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton reportedly pushed to close it as Secretary of State. Republican candidate Jeb Bush said recently that he saw no reason to close it. Donald Trump, who placed first in at least one recent Republican primary poll, said last year that releasing prisoners from Guantanamo was akin to the U.S. having a \u201cdeath wish.\u201d\n\nStill, with only a year and a half left in his term, progress in closing Guantanamo remains halting, at best.\n\nIn 2009, Obama signed an executive order directing a task force to make a plan to transfer the remaining detainees and close the facility. In 2010, Congress effectively blocked transfers from the prison. Those rules were loosened in 2013 to allow transfers to other countries, but not the United States. The administration appointed a special envoy to spearhead the transfer process.\n\nEnvoy Clifford Sloan left in December after managing to transfer 39 detainees in 18 months.\n\n\u201cI was pleased at the progress that we were able to make,\u201d he said in an interview with FRONTLINE, but added, \u201cAny month that goes by without a significant number of transfers is a missed opportunity.\u201d\n\nAfter six months, a new envoy, Lee Wolosky, an attorney with a background in national security cases, started last week. The State Department wouldn\u2019t make Wolosky available for an interview, but Ian Moss, the office\u2019s spokesman, said he\u2019s \u201chit the ground running.\u201d\n\nGETTING OUT OF \u2018GITMO\u2019\n\nTo leave Guantanamo, a detainee must be approved for release by a team from six government departments. The envoy must find a country that won\u2019t subject them to human rights abuses, but that can also offer assurances that they can keep the former detainee under close watch. Once a deal is in place, the Secretary of Defense must sign off on the plan and notify Congress.\n\nBut often, those familiar with the process say, the release of a detainee slows down once it reaches the Department of Defense.\n\nUnder Chuck Hagel, the previous secretary who left office in February, the sign-off process was intentionally slow. \u201cI take it seriously,\u201d he said of the decision to approve transfers earlier this year. \u201cI think it\u2019s an important one. I won\u2019t be rushed into any decisions. And I suspect I have not made everybody happy always on that point. But it\u2019s too big a decision to be made quickly or politically.\u201d\n\nHagel was replaced in February by Ashton Carter, who promised Congress during his confirmation hearing that he wouldn\u2019t succumb to pressure from the White House to speed up transfers from Guantanamo.\n\n\u201cIt should surprise no one that the Defense Department is not and has not been, for a very long time, fully onboard with closing Guantanamo,\u201d said Wells Dixon, a senior staff attorney for the Center for Constitutional Rights, a nonprofit legal organization that has pushed to close the facility and represents several people who are detained there.\n\nIn an e-mailed response to questions, the DOD said that it is committed to closing the facility. \u201cUnfortunately, this process can be slowed unnecessarily by burdensome legislative provisions,\u201d said Henrietta Levin, a department spokesperson, adding that it was up to Congress to streamline the process.\n\nLevin added, \u201cWe are taking all practicable steps to reduce the detainee population at Guantanamo and to close the detention facility in a responsible manner that protects our national security.\u201d\n\n\u201cNO SUCH THING AS ZERO RISK\u201d\n\nOne of the major obstacles to closing the prison is the fear that freed detainees will return to terrorism. As of January, six of 115 detainees transferred under the Obama administration have been confirmed to return to terrorism \u2014 about 5 percent, according to the most recent report from the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nUnder the George W. Bush administration, which transferred 532 detainees, the rate of recidivism was higher, at nearly 21 percent. All told, that\u2019s an 18 percent recidivism rate across both administrations.\n\nAnother 69 detainees are \u201csuspected\u201d of having engaged in terrorism, which the government defines as \u201cplausible but unverified or single-source reporting\u201d that the former detainee is directly involved in terrorist or insurgent activity. Only one of those, however, was released under the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as zero risk,\u201d Moss, the envoy spokesman, said. But, \u201cunder this administration, and with the approach we\u2019ve taken, we have had a very, very small percentage of individuals who are confirmed of having re-engaged.\u201d\n\nThe Defense Department set up a review board in 2011 to periodically reevaluate detainees for release. A panel with representatives from six departments \u2014 the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice, State, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the office of the Director of National Intelligence \u2014 consider the detainees\u2019 history, behavior during detention, and current statements, along with U.S. intelligence. To date, only 14 detainees are currently approved for transfer, although about half of the 116 detainees \u2014 54 \u2014 are eligible for the review process.\n\nTake the case of Tariq Mahmoud Ahmed al Sawah, an Egyptian and former Al Qaeda explosives expert who has admitted to taking part in terrorism, according to a government summary of his case. Al Sawah joined up with Taliban forces in 2000, although the U.S. found no indications that he was a high-ranking operative.\n\nIn February, 13 years into his time in Guantanamo, the board recommended al Sawah for transfer, citing his \u201cchange of ideology and renunciation of violence,\u201d and adding that he was \u201cone of the most compliant detainees.\u201d Al Sawah\u2019s detention, it concluded, \u201cis no longer necessary to protect against a continuing significant threat to the security of the United States.\u201d\n\nBut for now, al Sawah, along with the others already approved for transfer, is still in detention.\n\nEven if all of the eligible detainees are transferred, there are still at least 30 detainees whom the U.S. has deemed too dangerous to release, but is unwilling to put on trial. The Defense Department is working on a proposal to Congress to transfer those detainees to a secure U.S. facility, but it hasn\u2019t yet been presented.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "FRONTLINE", "description": "President Obama has had a great summer.
