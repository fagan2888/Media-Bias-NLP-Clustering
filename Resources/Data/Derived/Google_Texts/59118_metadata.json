The reason for the congregation\u2019s gathering? Mission of Mercy\u2019s weekly medical clinic.\n\nThe nonprofit faith-based community organization operates in six sites in the greater Phoenix area and also in parts of Maryland, Pennsylvania and Texas, providing free, no-questions-asked health care to thousands of people since its beginnings in 20 years ago.\n\nMission of Mercy began when founder Dr. Gianna Talone Sullivan felt a divine calling in 1991. In 1994, the first clinic began taking in economically disadvantaged people using, then as now, volunteer practitioners and donated space. To date, it has provided more than 380,000 patients free appointments and dispensed more than 645,000 prescriptions at its 17 pop-up style clinics in churches and community centers. Partnerships with pharmaceutical companies allow Mission of Mercy to often obtain just-expired yet still effective drugs.\n\nWhile it stems from a Christian ethic, the nonprofit does not have a proselytizing agenda.\n\nMission of Mercy receives some financial support from local hospitals that have seen their emergency room costs decline as a result of the group\u2019s presence. The remainder of the funding is strictly private donations and grants. That\u2019s because, as Mission of Mercy treats everyone regardless of citizenship status or income, it has chosen not to pursue state or federal funds, which often come with stipulations.\n\n\u201cI am no longer told by an insurance company,\u201d says Doctor Ira Ehrlich, a retired cardiologist who now practices primary care as a Mission of Mercy volunteer, \u201cwhat I can and can\u2019t do for a patient.\u201d\n\nDoctor Ehrlich puts in one day every week at Mission of Mercy in Arizona, usually at the Mesa location. In addition to the personal gratification he feels, he says that it is a true pleasure to be able to actually connect with his patients.\n\n\u201cAt the Mission of Mercy I can take all the time I want,\u201d says Doctor Ehrlich, \u201cand I think the patient leaves with the feeling that they\u2019ve actually seen a doctor and have been listened too.\u201d\n\nDespite the expansion of health care in America under the Affordable Care Act, the vagaries of federal and state guidelines have left many unable to access care or receive the level of care they need. One such person is Paul Scherb, a patient at the Mesa, Ariz. location. After losing his insurance (and his longtime job) a year ago, Scherb looked into what government benefits he might qualify for. He discovered that for an Arizona household of two (which describes the home he shares with his wife), his income must be less than $15,130 to be eligible for Medicaid \u2014 putting Scherb in the awkward position of self-identifying as poor, but not being poor enough to receive assistance.\n\n\u201cIf Mission of Mercy was not here,\u201d says Scherb, \u201cthen I would just be without health care. I couldn\u2019t afford the drugs, I can\u2019t afford the doctor.\u201d\n\nMission of Mercy also helps the immigrant population. At their clinics, Spanish interpreters (also volunteers), help serve those that don\u2019t speak English as their primary language. While Mission of Mercy does not ask residency questions, it doesn\u2019t know what proportion of its patients are illegal immigrants \u2014 but the number is presumably high. In Arizona alone, there were an estimated 400,000 undocumented immigrants in 2010, a figure that represents about six percent of the state\u2019s population. If not for Mission of Mercy, many of these people would have no choice but to visit hospital emergency rooms in a crisis, or to try and dangerously weather their maladies without medical assistance.\n\nMission of Mercy\u2019s operations are complicated, requiring coordination with religious institutions, hospitals, community centers, pharmaceutical companies, software for patient records and armies of volunteers. But at the core, the organization is quite simple: It will see anyone who needs care and treat those patients with dignity and respect.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying their best in a tough situation,\u201d Doctor Ehrlich says about his patients, \u201cand we\u2019re trying our best to help them in that tough situation.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "This nonprofit dispenses goodness in Arizona.", "og": {"site_name": "NationSwell", "description": "This nonprofit dispenses goodness in Arizona.", "title": "No Insurance?
