Pat Quinn and Republican challenger Bruce Rauner sparred over who could better improve the lives of Illinois\u2019 African American community, particularly on the issues of jobs, taxes, crime, and education.\n\nThough polling shows that black voters overwhelmingly support Quinn, Rauner said he believes the governor is \u201ctaking the African American vote for granted.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfrican-American families are suffering in Illinois \u2014 brutally high unemployment, deteriorating schools, lack of proper social services and rampant cronyism and corruption that\u2019s taking away job opportunities from African Americans,\u201d Rauner said.\n\nFor his part, Quinn noted that he has a diverse cabinet, while pointing out that his opponent failed to hire African Americans to executive positions at the equity investment firm Rauner previously chaired.\n\nThe businessman also hit Quinn for the incessant attack ads he\u2019s running against him. \u201cI cannot keep up with the baloney and lies that you spread,\u201d Rauner said. \u201cYou can\u2019t run on the truth. The truth is you\u2019re the worst governor in America.\u201d\n\nThe Chicago Tribune has more:\n\nAsked if he supported a ban on so-called assault weapons, Rauner did not directly answer, instead saying \u201cthe most important thing we can do with guns is to make sure we keep guns out of the hands of criminals and (the) mentally ill.\u201d Crime in the black community was a result of a \u201clack of opportunity\u201d caused by Democratic failures to improve education and create jobs, he said. But Quinn said he supported an assault weapons ban as well as a ban on high-capacity ammunition magazines \u2014 something unlikely to win approval in the General Assembly. The Democrat charged that Rauner\u2019s support of lowering state income tax rates to their 2010 levels is \u201cextreme, radical way\u201d of budgeting that will cost the state billions in tax revenues \u2014 much of it for education. Quinn wants to make permanent the state income tax increase Democrats passed and he signed after the 2010 election \u2014 but refused to say directly if he would push for it, win or lose, in the post-election, lame-duck session. The bulk of the tax hike is scheduled to roll back on Jan. 1. \u201cI understand how important education is to our jobs,\u201d said the governor, who added that \u201cto have good jobs, you need a good education and that\u2019s what I\u2019m committed to.\u201d Rauner has said he would increase school funding, but it\u2019s unclear how he would do so while cutting taxes. He also expressed support for giving parents \u201coptions\u201d to public schools, including charter schools, vouchers and scholarships. Quinn repeatedly cited his support for issues backed by hometown President Barack Obama, including the Affordable Care Act and a push for a higher minimum wage, as a way to enlist support among black voters. Obama made one fundraising visit for Quinn and is scheduled to appear at a rally on Sunday at Chicago State University, the governor said after the debate. Rauner has said he would not have expanded subsidized health care coverage for the poor under what\u2019s known as Obamacare.\n\n\u201cPat Quinn has been a total failure for the African American community of Illinois and the governor\u2019s failures were on full display,\u201d Rauner campaign spokesman Mike Schrimp said in a statement. \u201cWorse, the governor flat-out refused to back down on his plan to raise income taxes on families and small businesses right after the election. The African American community, like all communities across Illinois, are hurting under Pat Quinn and will be hurting even more if Pat Quinn gets his massive tax hike into law. The people of Illinois have a clear choice between Pat Quinn\u2019s massive tax increase and Bruce Rauner\u2019s vision of more jobs, better schools, lower taxes and term limits on career politicians.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In the second of three debates that took place on Monday night, Illinois Gov.
