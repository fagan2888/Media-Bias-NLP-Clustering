If it\u2019s raised, it could mean higher costs for mid-sized businesses.\n\nShaheen says she doubts New Hampshire\u2019s legislature will change the definition.\n\n\"We have heard from a number of insurers that they\u2019re happy with the small group market size,\" Shaheen says. \"We have a number of businesses and business organizations who have endorsed the PACE legislation in keeping the market size as it is.\"\n\nRepublican Senator Kelly Ayotte was a cosponsor of the bill, which passed Congress by unanimous consent.\n\n\"I was pleased to cosponsor this commonsense measure that will help ease burdensome regulations being imposed on New Hampshire\u2019s small businesses by the president\u2019s health care law,\" Ayotte said in a statement, adding that she will work against numerous other ACA provisions, including the so-called Cadillac Tax, the medical device tax, and restrictions on the use of health savings accounts.", "article_metadata": {"category": "NH News", "description": "President Obama has signed into law a bill that amends the Affordable Care Act to protect small and mid-size businesses from premium increases.
