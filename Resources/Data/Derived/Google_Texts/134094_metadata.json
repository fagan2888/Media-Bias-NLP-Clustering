The payer also will have to sign contracts with physicians months before it knows the rates for STAR Kids, the pediatric component of the State of Texas Access Reform Plus (STAR+Plus) program that takes effect in the fall of 2016.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a signature of faith,\u201d said Driscoll Health Plan CEO Dr. Mary Dale Petersen. It also means that Driscoll will have to be efficient and effective at coordinating care.\n\nDriscoll will be working closely with the physician community in the 24 counties \u2014 covering 25,000 square miles \u2014 of its service area in South Texas to make sure families have proper care plans and that primary care physicians have communication with hospital emergency departments in the name of care continuity.\n\nPetersen knows that health information exchange will be central to the effort, even though it has been \u201cproblematic,\u201d in South Texas and beyond. \u201cWe will be working through our portals,\u201d she said. Nurses will have to sign off on care plans within the portal.\n\nAnd there will be a lot of nurses. The STAR Kids contract will brings 17,000 new members into the health plan, so Driscoll expects to hire at least 260 new people, including about 200 nurses and social workers, and set up dedicated call centers.\n\nThese will be high-risk members. The Star KIDS partnership is focusing on medically complex children who qualify for Supplemental Security Income disability benefits, as well as emotionally disturbed and medically dependent children, Petersen said. \u201cThe whole goal is to make sure these children are not institutionalized,\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the Children\u2019s Hospital Association, children with medical complexities encompass 6 percent of youth enrolled in Medicaid nationally, but account for 40 percent of spending.\n\nDriscoll has brought in Valence Health, a consulting and technology firm serving healthcare organizations in risk-based payment models, to develop its alternative payment system. Chicago-based Valence just hired its first senior vice president of pediatrics, Dr. Tim Johnson, two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cChange can be scary for some people,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cWe need to create the messaging and the staffing to provide the handholding\u201d that many new members and their families will need.\n\nValence also is building out the payer\u2019s claims system for long-term care. These claims look different from standard hospital or physician claims.\n\nAdditionally, Driscoll is partnering with Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi to develop a comprehensive assessment for patients in their homes that considers social and environmental factors, Petersen said. Driscoll will be deploying tablets to its nursing corps to conduct the assessments in hopes of being more efficient and capturing better data.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a yearlong process to get it right,\u201d Petersen said.\n\nPhoto: Flickr user Texas State Library and Archives Commission", "article_metadata": {"description": "Driscoll Health Plan will have to be efficient and effective at coordinating care for medically complex children", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "MedCity News", "description": "Driscoll Health Plan will have to be efficient and effective at coordinating care for medically complex children", "title": "Texas health plan bets on care coordination for Medicaid kids", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/texas_flickr_texasstatelibraryandarchivescommission.jpg", "url": "http://medcitynews.com/2015/11/texas-health-plan-care-coordination-medicaid-kids/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://medcitynews.com/wp-content/uploads/texas_flickr_texasstatelibraryandarchivescommission.jpg", "creator": "@nversel", "description": "Driscoll Health Plan will have to be efficient and effective at coordinating care for medically complex children", "card": "summary", "title": "Texas health plan bets on care coordination for Medicaid kids"}, "robots": "noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 148725768475669}, "google-site-verification": "xudQg7nxVR9ifmMTY4Tf-0wVtX9b6rWLQd0utCweGOc", "keywords": "weight loss, obesity, overweight,diabetes,massachusetts,medical devices,obesity,startups,healthcare innovation, medcity news,medcity news,san francisco, startups, life sciences,accelerator,rock health,startup advice,startup funding,patient monitoring system, motion sensors ,dc,healthcare it,washington,foodborne pathogens, diagnostics company, diagnostic platforms,minimally invasive surgery, laser surgery,cambridge,dealflow,hospitals,wellpoint, healthways, health and wellness, employee wellness programs,investing,wellness,medtronic, shanghai innovation center, china, r&d,china,mdt,minneapolis,minnesota,publics,twin cities,ulcerative colitis, abbott labs, humira,abbott labs,doctors,pharmaceuticals,skin disorders, pharmaceuticals, md anderson cancer center,cancer,texas,renal denervation, st. jude medical,st. jude medical,stj,emr, ehr, electronic health records, electronic medical records, certified emr,certified emr,ehr,electronic health records,electronic medical records,advanced cellular technology,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,embryonic stem cells,geron corporation,lou gehrig\\'s disease,macular degeneration,regenerative medicine,spinal cord damage,value-based healthcare system, obamacare, fee-for-service model,california,cleveland,health insurance,insurance,ohio,pennsylvania,politics,cancer treatment options library, aetna, aet, healthcare it,aet,aetna,health it,phi,philadelphia,care coordination, Driscoll Children's Hospital, Driscoll Health Plan, Medicaid, Texas, , MedCity News", "article": {"section": "Daily", "tag": "Texas", "published_time": "2015-11-10T19:52:35-04:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,width=device-width,user-scalable=no,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cIt\u2019s a signature of faith,\u201d said Driscoll Health Plan CEO Dr. Mary Dale Petersen.\nDriscoll Health Plan, a subsidiary of Driscoll Children\u2019s Hospital in Corpus Christi, Texas, contracted to take on a new, value-based Medicaid managed care plan for indigent, disabled children next year before the state has decided what it will pay.\nPhoto: Flickr user Texas State Library and Archives Commission\nPetersen knows that health information exchange will be central to the effort, even though it has been \u201cproblematic,\u201d in South Texas and beyond.\nIt also means that Driscoll will have to be efficient and effective at coordinating care."}
