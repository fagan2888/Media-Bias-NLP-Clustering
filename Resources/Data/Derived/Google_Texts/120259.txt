Several fishermen discovered a man’s body floating in the water next to a dock at Main Reservoir in Lakewood Saturday afternoon.

Lakewood Police Department officials received a call from the fishermen shortly after 2 p.m., said police spokesperson Andrea Joo, who noted that the victim has not yet been identified.

The fishermen told police they thought the body was a fish at first.

Officials don’t yet know the cause of death, but do not believe foul play is involved.
