They say this study shows there's possibly less transfer of information between the two halves of the brain.\n\nThe study concludes, \"Since high-potency preparations are now replacing traditional herbal drugs in many European countries, raising awareness about the risks of high-potency cannabis is crucial.\" (Video via CNN)\n\nThe researchers don't outright call skunk dangerous. It's more of a warning that monitoring THC levels \u2014 just how strong pot is \u2014 is important.\n\nOne researcher told The Guardian, \"When it comes to alcohol, we are used to thinking about how much people drink, and whether they are drinking wine, beer, or whisky. We should think of cannabis in a similar way.\"\n\nThis video includes images from Getty Images and the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Researchers in Italy and the U.K. have found high-potency marijuana can affect the corpus callosum, the nerves that connect the halves of the brain.", "og": {"site_name": "Newsy", "description": "Researchers in Italy and the U.K. have found high-potency marijuana can affect the corpus callosum, the nerves that connect the halves of the brain.", "title": "'Skunk' Pot May Hinder Brain's Ability To Send And Receive Messages", "url": "http://www.newsy.com/videos/skunk-pot-may-hinder-brain-s-ability-to-send-and-receive-messages/", "image": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1448720004.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Researchers in Italy and the U.K. have found high-potency marijuana can affect the corpus callosum, the nerves that connect the halves of the brain.", "title": "'Skunk' Pot May Hinder Brain's Ability To Send And Receive Messages", "url": "https://www.newsy.com/videos/skunk-pot-may-hinder-brain-s-ability-to-send-and-receive-messages/", "image": "https://newsymain-npgroup.netdna-ssl.com/images/videos/m/1448720004.jpg", "site": "@newsyvideos", "player": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://player.ooyala.com/tframe.html?embedCode=tvdnM2eToVO0EdvQsimIqUeSYRqU5F-a&pbid=54ea1c2f14ee44369ddf31ac887ffe7e", "height": 225}, "app": {"url": {"ipad": "newsy://54103", "iphone": "newsy://54103", "googleplay": "com.newsy"}, "name": {"ipad": "Newsy: Video News", "iphone": "Newsy: Video News", "googleplay": "Newsy: Multisource Video News"}, "id": {"ipad": 330879884, "iphone": 330879884, "googleplay": "com.newsy"}}, "card": "player"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "newsy://54103", "app_store_id": 330879884, "app_name": "Newsy: Video News"}}, "msvalidate.01": "675C8D40A5F1E0722AA2D3A33379E884", "fb": {"app_id": 380870506022, "pages": 49978948774}, "google-site-verification": "o36fft0HATmhbZ_GPX4YSOS3EmkTGkPrvNFxQwzcNbY", "keywords": "skunk pot,skunk marijuana,smoking skunk,cannabis,high-potency,thc levels,skunk thc,corpus callosum,psychosis,marijuana effects on brain,science news,newsy,london", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/newsyvideos"}, "thumbnail": "http://newsymain.npgroup.netdna-cdn.com/images/videos/m/1448720004.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0"}, "article_summary": "The corpus callosum is that thick band of nerves in the center that connects the left half of the brain with the right.\nSmoking especially strong pot \u2014 or skunk \u2014 may damage nerve fibers responsible for sending and receiving messages in the brain.\nThe study concludes, \"Since high-potency preparations are now replacing traditional herbal drugs in many European countries, raising awareness about the risks of high-potency cannabis is crucial.\"\nResearchers in Italy and the U.K. have found high-potency marijuana can affect the corpus callosum, the nerves that connect the halves of the brain.\n(Video via CNN)The researchers don't outright call skunk dangerous."}
