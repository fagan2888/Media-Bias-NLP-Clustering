Comstock, however, said she believes \u201cthe companies can decide if they have a conscience issue with it and don\u2019t want to provide it.\u201d She claimed increased availability would bring down the cost to \u201c6 or 7 dollars,\u201d and cited the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) and their support for over-the-counter birth control to back up her position.\n\nBut the ACOG has recently blasted Republican candidates for using over-the-counter contraception as \u201ca political tool,\u201d and clarified that they support many additional policies that Republicans have yet to embrace, such as providing all contraception \u201cat no cost\u201d under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nComstock also did not mention her past support for Virginia\u2019s controversial mandatory ultrasound law, which in its original iteration would have forced some pregnant women, including survivors of rape or incest, to undergo a transvaginal ultrasound before receiving an abortion. The final version mandates only abdominal ultrasounds.\n\nComstock, a former lobbyist for Koch Industries and the military contractor Blackwater, has also been a vocal opponent of expanding Medicaid to 400,000 currently uninsured Virginians, an estimated 169,000 of whom are women. Comstock has also promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act if elected to Congress.\n\nStill, she insisted she\u2019s the best candidate to enact \u201cfamily friendly\u201d policies in Washington. \u201cI\u2019ve always supported equal pay and I have fought for that my whole life,\u201d she told ThinkProgress. \u201cThe one thing I will say is that I work harder than a lot of the guys. In Congress you get paid the same, so I get paid the same whether I work a lot more.\u201d\n\nCREDIT: Alice Ollstein\n\nGOP Senate hopeful Ed Gillespie was also supposed to attend the \u201cRally in the Valley,\u201d but canceled last minute and sent his wife Cathy Gillespie instead. She told the crowd that the Obama Administration\u2019s policies are \u201cnot just killing our jobs, but killing our work ethic,\u201d and urged the attendees to vote for her husband to protest his opponent Mark Warner\u2019s support for Obamacare and efforts to address climate change.\n\nShe added that it was especially important to counter the charge that Republican lawmakers have waged a \u201cWar on Women,\u201d and asked the audience, \u201cHow could they anyone ever think we have a War on Women when we\u2019re running great women candidates like Barbara Comstock?\u201d\n\nJust minutes later, local community leader Chuck Pearce took the microphone to auction off donated items. Holding up a floral patterned purse, Pearce joked: \u201cGet this for your wife and then you can watch as much football as you want!\u201d When offering up a set of beer glasses decorated with owls, he offered: \u201cWhen your wife says you\u2019ve had too much to drink, now you can tell her, \u2018I don\u2019t give a hoot!'\u201d He later shared that he bought a GPS for his car, but took it back to the dealer because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want another woman telling me what to do!\u201d\n\nRepublicans have ample cause to be anxious about their standing among women voters, especially in Virginia. Women voters delivered decisive victories to Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe in 2013 and President Obama in 2012. Hoping to repeat their success in the Virginia gubernatorial race, Planned Parenthood and other reproductive rights groups are spending millions to defeat candidates with anti-woman policies. Democratic candidates, including Comstock\u2019s opponent John Foust, have also run ads specifically focusing on reproductive rights.", "article_metadata": {"google": "nositelinkssearchbox", "description": "A Republican gathering for House candidate Barbara Comstock featured sexist jokes and sheet cake.", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2", "og": {"site_name": "ThinkProgress", "description": "A Republican gathering for House candidate Barbara Comstock featured sexist jokes and sheet cake.", "title": "Virginia Candidate Who Backed Forced Ultrasound Law Tries To Win Back Women Voters", "url": "http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2014/09/24/3571344/barbara-comstock-interview/", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CCake.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "A Republican gathering for House candidate Barbara Comstock featured sexist jokes and sheet cake.", "title": "Virginia Candidate Who Backed Forced Ultrasound Law Tries To Win Back Women Voters", "image": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CCake-321x214.jpg", "creator": "@AdamReports", "site": "@ThinkProgress", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noodp", "elq-topic": "tp-politics", "fb": {"admins": 100001364918392, "pages": 200137333331078, "app_id": 144881328916524}, "thumb2": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CCake.jpg", "thumb1": "http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CCake.jpg", "google-site-verification": "HDCaom2KPSt1X92eD5CiYHCkWvb5nP09lhEAOPZ5rts", "article": {"published_time": "2014-09-24T09:18:07+00:00", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/AliceMOllstein"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8618\"", "article_summary": "Women voters delivered decisive victories to Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe in 2013 and President Obama in 2012.\nHoping to repeat their success in the Virginia gubernatorial race, Planned Parenthood and other reproductive rights groups are spending millions to defeat candidates with anti-woman policies.\nPolitics Virginia Candidate Who Backed Forced Ultrasound Law Tries To Win Back Women Voters CREDIT: Alice OllsteinWINCHESTER, VIRGINIA \u2014 In a windowless Elks Lodge ballroom on Saturday, a group of about 50 white and elderly Republicans dined on barbecue and sheet cake as they listened to a brief campaign pitch from Barbara Comstock, who is running to represent Northern Virginia in the House of Representatives.\nIn a conversation with ThinkProgress following her speech, Comstock said she\u2019s on board with the growing list of Republicans endorsing over-the-counter birth control.\nDemocratic candidates, including Comstock\u2019s opponent John Foust, have also run ads specifically focusing on reproductive rights."}
