Even in the face of bold facts to the contrary.\n\nObamaCare state exchanges are failing one after the other and he routinely informs both domestic and foreign audiences that it\u2019s a huge success.\n\nThanks to his virtual international coalition of 65 countries, now minus Canada, Obama says on national TV that ISIS is contained. Hours later, its operatives kill 130 in Paris, an horrific slaughter the Democrat dismissed as a \u201csetback.\u201d Yes, especially for the dead people.\n\nThe United Nations \u2014 that once well-meaning, now feckless body of talkers \u2014 assembles scores of delegates to emit hot air in Paris about global warming, which Obama says was a sharp rebuke to ISIS\u2019 killers. At least two of its adherents apparently missed the rebuff and killed 14 Americans in San Bernardino.\n\nObama repeats that the greatest threat to American national security is global warming, which Army leaders don\u2019t even include among top threats.\n\nAgainst overwhelmingly negative public opinion, Obama says he\u2019ll admit to the United States at least 10,000 alleged refugees from Syria, dismissing doubters as needless worriers or perhaps religious bigots.\n\nHe assures that\u2019s because each one of the newcomers will be thoroughly vetted first by that same U.N. and then by U.S. security agencies. The FBI director says thorough vetting of paperless refugees from a chaotic war zone is impossible.\n\nNow it emerges that the thorough U.S. vetting of the fortunately deceased female San Bernardino terrorist from Pakistan did not include even checking her jihadist social media postings. No \u201cLikes\u201d for that negligence.\n\nIn his reluctant Dec. 6 Oval Office Address, Obama said things like: \u201cSince the day I took this office, I\u2019ve authorized U.S. forces to take out terrorists abroad precisely because I know how real the danger is.\u201d\n\nInquiring minds wonder to what effect? How did terrorism\u2019s leadership, which he said was \u201cdecimated\u201d in 2012, reconstitute itself so effectively? And why is Obama intellectually incapable of calling Islamic extremists what they are?\n\nHe talks of increasing allied air assaults. But we\u2019re 17 months into the assaults. Why does it take new terrorist attacks to ramp up what he said we were already doing? And why do 75% of the sorties return without dropping their ordnance? (Hint: Obama\u2019s strict rules of engagement prohibit collateral casualties and require advance leaflet drop warnings.)\n\nIn his weekly remarks Saturday Obama said \u201cOur airstrikes are hitting ISIL harder than ever.\u201d Which wouldn\u2019t take much.\n\nHe also stated, accurately, that Special Ops forces are in action, but neglected to mention they total about 250 against an ISIS army estimated at 40,000.\n\nThen, in a jaw-dropping self-parody, the president said he would continue his fight against terrorism by visiting two government offices this week, the Pentagon and Counter-Terrorism center. No doubt ISIS leaders are quaking in their sandals.\n\nThe respected Thomas Lifson over at American Thinker wrote: \u201cNo wonder so many in the public actively distrust and disbelieve what they are told by the nation\u2019s elites.\u201d\n\nThen, there\u2019s the Iran nuclear deal. You may recall, although you\u2019re not supposed to, the interminable negotiations were touted as preventing the world\u2019s largest national exporter of terrorism from developing nuclear weapons. We now know Iran hasn\u2019t even signed the agreement.\n\nAnd Iran has violated existing U.N. resolutions in recent weeks by testing not once, but twice, ICBMs capable of carrying nuke warheads. The second test came as the U.N. was still discussing the first violation.\n\nLast week Obama\u2019s U.N. Ambassador, Samantha Power, was asked in a Senate committee hearing what action the administration has taken about the obvious Iranian violations. She said it had presented the case to the U.N. where there had been \u201cmultiple discussions.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiscussions are a form of U.N. action,\u201d Power explained.\n\nWell, such Obama team thinking is a form of irresponsible inaction \u2014 and frightening delusion.\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe Incredible Shrinking President\n\nNews Flash for Obama: Terrorism isn\u2019t scaring Americans; You are\n\nFinally, someone in office says it: \u2018We are at war with militant Islam\u2019\n\nDefiant Obama vows unchanged ISIS strategy, more Syrian refugees", "article_metadata": {"description": "One of the more intriguing -- and disturbing -- aspects of Barack Obama's presidential behavior is his stubbornly persistent belief that saying something,", "og": {"site_name": "Investor's Business Daily", "description": "One of the more intriguing \u2014 and disturbing \u2014 aspects of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential behavior is his stubbornly persistent belief that saying something, anything, makes it so.
