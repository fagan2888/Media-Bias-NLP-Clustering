Right now, it\u2019s a real whodunit.\u201d\n\nThe wounded officer was taken to University of Colorado Hospital, where he was in surgery for several hours. He is in serious but stable condition and is expected to survive, according to Fania. The officer\u2019s name has not been released.\n\nPolice worked through the night to try to find the shooter, Fania said.\n\n\u201cEverybody is concerned about getting this knucklehead off the street,\u201d he said.\n\nAround 9:05 p.m. Friday, a patrol car with two uniformed patrol officers pulled a car over for a traffic stop in the 1700 block of Fulton Street, according to Fania.\n\nAt the time, the officers did not know that the driver had just stolen the puffer car a few blocks away.\n\nA puffer car is one the motorist starts, usually in cold weather, and leaves running unattended. A target for thieves, such cars are easily stolen.\n\nAs the officers were walking up to the suspect\u2019s car to make contact with the driver, the suspect fired several shots from the driver\u2019s side window, striking one of the officers. The second officer returned fire, shooting multiple times as the suspect sped north on Fulton.\n\nThe car was abandoned two blocks later, at East 19th Avenue and Fulton, and the suspect fled.\n\nThere was no description of the suspect Saturday.\n\nAurora police set up a command post near Fulton and East Montview Boulevard.\n\n\u201cThat was a huge perimeter and we couldn\u2019t find him,\u201d Fania said. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to get a break from someone calling in.\u201d\n\nInvestigators were processing the car in the hopes of finding fingerprints or DNA left by the suspect, Fania said.\n\nPolice warned residents of the neighborhood \u2014 north of Crawford Elementary School \u2014 to stay in their homes and call 911 if they see anything suspicious.\n\nDenver police and Jefferson County authorities assisted Aurora police. Officers set up what they called \u201can expanding perimeter,\u201d and dozens of officers flooded the area, searching cars and knocking on doors. A helicopter was deployed and police K-9 units aided in the search.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of resources out here,\u201d Fania said late Friday.\n\nHe said authorities were doing a \u201csystematic search in all directions.\u201d\n\n\u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll find this guy soon,\u201d he said.\n\nBut by 1:45 a.m., the perimeter was taken down.\n\nFania said a large police presence would remain on Fulton on Saturday.", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Aurora: Dragnet continues for suspect who shot policeman", "title": "Aurora: Dragnet continues for suspect who shot policeman", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/11/15/aurora-dragnet-continues-for-suspect-who-shot-policeman/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141115_093059_aurora-cop-shot.jpg", "height": 452}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141115_093059_aurora-cop-shot.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-11-15T08:44:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T13:05:51+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd00e6\"", "article_summary": "A puffer car is one the motorist starts, usually in cold weather, and leaves running unattended.\nAt the time, the officers did not know that the driver had just stolen the puffer car a few blocks away.\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to get a break from someone calling in.\u201dInvestigators were processing the car in the hopes of finding fingerprints or DNA left by the suspect, Fania said.\nThe car was abandoned two blocks later, at East 19th Avenue and Fulton, and the suspect fled.\nThe second officer returned fire, shooting multiple times as the suspect sped north on Fulton."}
