There’s little doubt that President Obama dislikes the Fox News Channel, especially when it comes to his signature healthcare law. As seen in the video, he loves to call the network out for ridicule.

Unfortunately for him, this speech was given a few days ‘before’ the disastrous launch of the website he was touting.

A new poll out is not going to do much to improve this relationship, as it shows more Americans trust Fox News as a source of information about Obamacare than they do the man for whom the law is named after.

According to YouGov.com, 19 percent of those polled said they trust Fox News more, compared to only 11 percent who said they trust Obama, the Washington Examiner reported.
