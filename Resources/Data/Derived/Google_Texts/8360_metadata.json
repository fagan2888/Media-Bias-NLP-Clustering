The court justified this dichotomous view of the custodian and individual on the grounds that if the privilege against self-incrimination could be asserted to protect a business\u2019s records, then it \u201cwould have a detrimental impact on the government\u2019s efforts to prosecute white-collar crime, one of the most serious problems confronting law enforcement authorities.\u201d\n\nThat view of the distinction between the individual and the corporation is in stark contrast to the Supreme Court\u2019s more recent decisions in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores about the rights of corporations. In Citizens United, the court struck down a ban on corporations spending money on behalf of candidates in political campaigns, pointing out that it has \u201crejected the argument that political speech of corporations or other associations should be treated differently under the First Amendment simply because such associations are not natural persons.\u201d\n\nIn Hobby Lobby, the court applied the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which prevents the government from substantially burdening \u201ca person\u2019s exercise of religion,\u201d to a corporation that objected on religious grounds to the requirement of the Affordable Care Act that its health insurance program provide birth control.\n\nIn determining whether the right to religious freedom extended to a business, the court found that corporations were \u201cpersons\u201d under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act because \u201ca corporation is simply a form of organization used by human beings to achieve desired ends.\u201d\n\nIf corporations are really just a collection of individuals, then the protection afforded by the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination may apply to a business, especially when there is only one owner and employee who will be incriminated if forced to turn over its records.\n\nYet, the appeals court in the Grand Jury case summarily rejected that argument in a footnote. \u201cWe discern nothing in Supreme Court jurisprudence that suggests the court has, in any way, signaled its readiness to depart from its longstanding precedent regarding corporate custodians\u2019 inability to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination,\u201d it stated.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nCorporations are not without some constitutional protection in an investigation. The Fourth Amendment, which recognizes \u201cthe right of the people\u201d to be free from \u201cunreasonable searches and seizures,\u201d protects the privacy of a business to the same extent as an individual. No less than Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote in 1920 in Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States that \u201cthe rights of a corporation against unlawful search and seizure are to be protected even if the same result might have been achieved in a lawful way.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court was closely divided in the Braswell, Citizens United and Hobby Lobby decisions, each decided on a 5-4 vote of the justices. The court decided the Braswell case in 1988, well before the more recent cases involving corporate constitutional rights articulated the view that organizations are an embodiment of the individuals who choose to associate themselves. There is a sharp contrast in how the court has treated corporations in these areas, relying on the legal fiction of a separate organizational existence to deny the Fifth Amendment protection to corporations while piercing through it to protect First Amendment rights.\n\nJustice Anthony M. Kennedy may play a central role in pushing for reconsideration of the approach in the Braswell decision to the rights of an individual representing a corporation responding to a subpoena. He wrote a strong dissent in that case, arguing that the majority gave \u201cthe corporate agent fiction a weight it simply cannot bear.\u201d He wrote the majority opinion in the Citizens United decision, and in a concurring opinion in the Hobby Lobby case, he noted that \u201cthe plaintiffs deem it necessary to exercise their religious beliefs within the context of their own closely held, for-profit corporations.\u201d\n\nIf the doctor in the Grand Jury case decides to pursue the challenge to the subpoena to the Supreme Court, it could be a vehicle to reconsider the scope of the collective entity rule. Large, publicly traded companies are unlikely to be affected by any change in the availability of the privilege against self-incrimination because they can easily respond to a demand for records through a custodian who has no connection to potential wrongdoing. For a smaller business, like a medical practice or professional partnership, recognizing the right of an owner to assert the Fifth Amendment privilege would make it more difficult to investigate white-collar crime by placing an new obstacle in the way of seeking records.\n\nWhether the justices are willing to hamstring investigations in the name of protecting the rights of individuals operating through a business organization will be an important consideration in deciding whether the Fifth Amendment should apply to corporations.\n\nSo the Supreme Court may be called on once again to decide how much corporations really are like people.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20150526121601, "twitter": {"description": "Courts have ruled that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination does not apply to corporations, but a recent case challenged that notion.", "title": "Treating Corporations as People", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/business/dealbook/treating-corporations-as-people.html", "app": {"url": {"googleplay": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003703584"}, "name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}}, "site": "@nytimes", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/31/business/db-whitecollar-web1/db-whitecollar-web1-thumbLarge.jpg", "card": "summary"}, "al": {"ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/business/dealbook/treating-corporations-as-people.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "android": {"url": "nytimes://reader/id/100000003703584", "app_name": "NYTimes", "package": "com.nytimes.android"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/business/dealbook/treating-corporations-as-people.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "thumbnail_width": 75, "dfp-ad-unit-path": "business/dealbook", "sectionfront_jsonp": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/dealbook/index.jsonp", "video": {"playerId": 2640832222001, "publisherReadToken": "cE97ArV7TzqBzkmeRVVhJ8O6GWME2iG_bRvjBTlNb4o.", "publisherId": 1749339200, "noShareToolsPlayerId": 3692909326001}, "DISPLAYDATE": "May 26, 2015", "edt": "The New York Times on the Web", "article": {"section": "DealBook", "modified": "2015-05-27", "collection": "https://static01.nyt.com/services/json/sectionfronts/business/dealbook/index.jsonp", "tag": "Supreme Court (US)", "published": "2015-05-26", "section-taxonomy-id": "104D1E63-9701-497B-8CF4-A4D120C9014E"}, "keywords": "Fifth Amendment (US Constitution),Corporations,Self-Incrimination,Supreme Court (US)", "description": "Courts have ruled that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination does not apply to corporations, but a recent case challenged that notion.", "applicationName": "article", "PT": "article", "author": "Peter J.
