The nonprofit, Laughing Feet, is one of 55 organizations participating in the second annual Wichita Art Day of Giving or ArtDOG.

The event is a 24-hour charitable giving campaign designed to support area nonprofits related to the arts.

Participating organizations have the opportunity to both increase their donor bases, as well as bring awareness to not only their nonprofit, but the arts in Wichita.

This year's event will take place on April 24.

Last year's, first-ever ArtDOG raised $548,372 for 38 Wichita arts organizations in the 24-hour event.
