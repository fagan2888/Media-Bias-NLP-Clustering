During the NBC Democratic debate, Clinton said, \u201cWe\u2019ve accomplished so much already. I do not want to see the Republicans repeal it. And I don\u2019t wanna see us start over again with a contentious debate. I want us to defend and build on the Affordable Care Act and improve it.\u201d\n\nYesterday, while campaigning in Iowa, the former secretary of state used a different version of the same line, \u201cI know Senator Sanders cares about covering more people, as I do, but rather build on the progress that has been made, he wants to start over from scratch with a whole new system.\u201d\n\nThe campaign\u2019s decision to attack from the right on healthcare could be costing Clinton a potential victory in Iowa. In the Nov/Dec 15 CNN/ORC Iowa poll, Clinton led Sanders 63%-31% on the issue of healthcare. Today, Sanders leads Clinton 51%-45%.\n\nThe problem with the Clinton stance on healthcare is that many Democrats appreciate the Affordable Care Act, but they have always wanted to go further. A December 2015, Kaiser Health Tracking Poll found that 58% of all Americans supported a Medicare for all plan, such as what Bernie Sanders has proposed. Support was even higher for the Sanders plan among Democrats (81%), and Independents (60%). The idea of Medicare for all was opposed by 63% of Republicans.\n\nThe Clinton campaign\u2019s strategy to launch a conservative attack which they wanted to be a defense of the ACA has resulted in Clinton sounding like she is opposed to an idea that is wildly popular with Democrats and Independents.\n\nPolling shows that the health care attack has backfired on the Clinton campaign in Iowa. Running to the right of Bernie Sanders on healthcare isn\u2019t working, and appears to be alienating Iowa Democrats.\n\nThe campaign\u2019s decision to go with a relatively conservative position on health care may help them in a general election, but it is doing them no favors in the first in the nation caucus.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The latest Democratic polling from Iowa reveals that the Clinton campaign's decision to attack Bernie Sanders on healthcare is backfiring and could cost her a victory in the Hawkeye State.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "author": "Jason Easley", "og": {"site_name": "Politicus USA", "description": "The latest Democratic polling from Iowa reveals that the Clinton campaign's decision to attack Bernie Sanders on healthcare is backfiring and could cost her a victory in the Hawkeye State.", "title": "Poll Reveals Healthcare Attacks On Sanders Backfire And May Cost Hillary Clinton Iowa", "url": "http://www.politicususa.com/2016/01/22/poll-reveals-healthcare-attacks-sanders-backfire-cost-hillary-clinton-iowa.html", "image": "http://15130-presscdn-0-89.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/clinton-sanders-nbc-dem-debate.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-01-22T11:43:52+00:00", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 523732690, "app_id": 113462415332922, "pages": 186473214703370}, "keywords": "Editors' Picks,Featured News,Hillary Clinton,Bernie Sanders leading in Iowa,clinton attacks Sanders on healthcare,iowa poll,politicususa,liberal,politics,sarah jones,jason easley,barack obama,bernie sanders,msnbc,media", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PoliticusUSA", "section": "Hillary Clinton", "published_time": "2016-01-22T11:43:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-22T11:43:52+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Bernie Sanders leading in Iowa, clinton attacks Sanders on healthcare, Hillary Clinton, iowa poll"}, "article_summary": "The latest Democratic polling from Iowa reveals that the Clinton campaign\u2019s decision to attack Bernie Sanders on healthcare is backfiring and could cost her a victory in the Hawkeye State.\nRunning to the right of Bernie Sanders on healthcare isn\u2019t working, and appears to be alienating Iowa Democrats.\nIn the Nov/Dec 15 CNN/ORC Iowa poll, Clinton led Sanders 63%-31% on the issue of healthcare.\nPolling shows that the health care attack has backfired on the Clinton campaign in Iowa.\nFor weeks, the Clinton campaign has tried to separate itself from Sanders on healthcare."}
