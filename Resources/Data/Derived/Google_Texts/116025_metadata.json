Former governor (and presumed presidential candidate) Rick Perry described the implementation of the Obamacare as a \u201ccriminal act\u201d that the country should not accept. The current governor, Greg Abbott, has sued the Obama administration over the Affordable Care Act and is showing no signs of warming up to the law anytime soon. Sen. Ted Cruz made a name for himself with a 21-hour fake \u201cfilibuster\u201d in opposition to Obamacare and is currently running for president on the promise to repeal every single word of it. After the law was passed, Texas joined several other Republican-dominated states in refusing to expand Medicaid and refusing to set up its own state-based health insurance exchange. Texas clearly has it in for Obamacare.\n\nAnd that\u2019s too bad because, even with all that determined political opposition, Obamacare is actually doing some good things in the Lone Star state. Prior to the ACA\u2019s implementation, Texas had the highest uninsured rate in the nation, the most uninsured children in the nation, and the highest uninsured rate among poor residents in the nation. According to a new study from Rice University, the uninsured rate in Texas has dropped by a significant margin, and Obamacare is the reason why.\n\nIn September 2013, Texas\u2019 overall uninsured rate was 24.6 percent. In the 18 months that followed, the rate dropped to 16.9 percent. That\u2019s still the highest rate for any state in the country, but a significant improvement nonetheless. \u201cWe \ufb01nd that the ACA has had a substantial positive impact on the rate of health insurance coverage among Texans,\u201d the study notes. \u201cThe drop is almost entirely attributable to newly insured individuals who purchased their own plans. The reduction in the rate of uninsured individuals occurred across all age groups, including younger adults.\u201d\n\nBut, of course, the news is not as good as it could be. While the overall uninsured rate is going down in spite of the state\u2019s political resistance to the ACA, the opposition is still taking its toll. \u201cThe percent of uninsured Texans with incomes above 138% of the federal poverty level dropped by 44.5% while those with the lowest income only dropped by 19.7%,\u201d per the Rice study. \u201cAs of March 2015, the lowest income Texans are almost four times more likely to be uninsured than higher income individuals.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "In spite of GOP opposition, Texas has benefited from Obamacare and stands to lose a lot if the law is crippled", "title": "Obamacare is helping Texas, no thanks to Rick Perry and Ted Cruz", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "In spite of GOP opposition, Texas has benefited from Obamacare and stands to lose a lot if the law is crippled", "title": "Obamacare is helping Texas, no thanks to Rick Perry and Ted Cruz", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/01/obamacare_is_helping_texas_no_thanks_to_rick_perry_and_ted_cruz/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/cruz_perry.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "In spite of GOP opposition, Texas has benefited from Obamacare and stands to lose a lot if the law is crippled", "title": "Obamacare is helping Texas, no thanks to Rick Perry and Ted Cruz", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/10/cruz_perry.jpg", "creator": "@SimonMaloy", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Simon Maloy", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Affordable Care Act, Greg Abbott, Healthcare Reform, insurance subsidies, king v. burwell, Medicaid expansion, Obamacare, Rick Perry, Ted Cruz, Texas, Uninsured", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd32b4\"", "article_summary": "Topics: Affordable Care Act, Greg Abbott, Healthcare Reform, insurance subsidies, king v. burwell, Medicaid expansion, Obamacare, Rick Perry, Ted Cruz, Texas, Uninsured, Politics NewsThere aren\u2019t many places in the country with stronger political opposition to Obamacare than Texas.\nAnd that\u2019s too bad because, even with all that determined political opposition, Obamacare is actually doing some good things in the Lone Star state.\nPrior to the ACA\u2019s implementation, Texas had the highest uninsured rate in the nation, the most uninsured children in the nation, and the highest uninsured rate among poor residents in the nation.\nAccording to a new study from Rice University, the uninsured rate in Texas has dropped by a significant margin, and Obamacare is the reason why.\nIn September 2013, Texas\u2019 overall uninsured rate was 24.6 percent."}
