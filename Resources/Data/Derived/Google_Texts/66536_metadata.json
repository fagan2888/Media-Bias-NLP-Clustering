And their going to let my uncle do his ranching that he\u2019s been doing?\u201d\n\nShe told Bodel the BLM is leaving.\n\n\u201cGrandma, this news lady from the Washington Free Beacon is on the line right now and the report that she\u2019s gotten is that the BLM is pulling out, and they\u2019re not going to close off our land anymore. They\u2019re gonna cut their losses and they\u2019re gonna go wherever they came from.\u201d\n\nBodel was pleased by the news.\n\n\u201cGrandma says, \u2018Oh, wonderful. Thank you,\u2019\u201d Hafen relayed.\n\nAn estimated 200 armed officials had surrounded the ranch, the culmination of a dispute dating back 20 years over \u201cgrazing fees\u201d and the protection of the \u201cdesert tortoise.\u201d\n\nBundy\u2019s son Dave was arrested for taking pictures along a state highway and the BLM brought in rangers from out of state to deal with protesters in \u201cFirst Amendment Areas\u201d the agency had set up, restricting access for citizens to peacefully protest the removal. The agency had received harsh criticism from Gov. Brian Sandoval (R.), members of Congress, and the media for its handling of the operation.\n\nDuring a heated confrontation on Wednesday between rangers, members of the Bundy family, and other protesters, Ammon Bundy, one of Cliven\u2019s sons, was tasered. A 57-year-old cancer survivor was also pushed to the ground, drawing concern from lawmakers who said the BLM was using \u201cbrutal physical force.\u201d\n\nThe family was also concerned about the treatment of their cattle, and the BLM refused to say if they had euthanized any cows during the removal.\n\n\u201cAs we have said from the beginning of the gather to remove illegal cattle from federal land consistent with court orders, a safe and peaceful operation is our number one priority,\u201d Kornze said. \u201cAfter one week, we have made progress in enforcing two recent court orders to remove the trespass cattle from public lands that belong to all Americans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe ask that all parties in the area remain peaceful and law-abiding as the Bureau of Land Management and National Park Service work to end the operation in an orderly manner,\u201d he added.\n\nThe BLM said they \u201cremain disappointed that Cliven Bundy continues to not comply\u201d with two court orders for him to remove his cattle from the land. The majority of Clark County, Nev. was set aside for the desert tortoise in 1998.\n\nThe government attests that Bundy still owes over $1 million in grazing fees, and said they would \u201ccontinue to work to resolve the matter administratively and judicially.\u201d Bundy argues he owes roughly $300,000.\n\nAdditional requests for comment on the status of the impounded cattle, and the future of the operation from the BLM were not immediately returned.", "article_metadata": {"generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "The federal government has given up on its roundup of Cliven Bundy\u2019s cattle on public land in Nevada, ending a tense standoff between the family and hundreds of armed officials who surrounded the ra", "title": "Feds End Standoff on Bundy Ranch", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/issues/feds-end-standoff-on-bundy-ranch/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AP705851124785-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The federal government has given up on its roundup of Cliven Bundy\u2019s cattle on public land in Neva", "creator": "@LizWFB", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/AP705851124785-150x150.jpg", "title": "Feds End Standoff on Bundy Ranch", "site": "@freebeacon", "card": "summary"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID", "pages": 282024895179874}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is the first I\u2019ve heard the impoundment being pulled,\u201d she said, from a separate house some miles from the Bundy ranch.\nDuring a heated confrontation on Wednesday between rangers, members of the Bundy family, and other protesters, Ammon Bundy, one of Cliven\u2019s sons, was tasered.\nBY: Follow @LizWFBThe federal government has given up on its roundup of Cliven Bundy\u2019s cattle on public land in Nevada, ending a tense standoff between the family and hundreds of armed officials who surrounded the ranch.\nThe BLM said they \u201cremain disappointed that Cliven Bundy continues to not comply\u201d with two court orders for him to remove his cattle from the land.\nAnd their going to let my uncle do his ranching that he\u2019s been doing?\u201dShe told Bodel the BLM is leaving."}
