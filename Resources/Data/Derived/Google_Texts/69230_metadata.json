(AWS) is buying venture capital-backed Elemental Technologies Inc. Owned by Amazon.com Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN), AWS is the leading provider of cloud-computing infrastructure in the world. Elemental develops software that enables companies to re-format video produced for traditional broadcast networks so that it can be distributed over the Internet on PCs, smartphones, tablets and TV. Terms of the deal, announced late Sept. 3, are undisclosed, but reports peg it at $500 million.\n\nElemental has raised about $44 million in venture capital funding from firms including General Catalyst Partners, Luminari Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, Steamboat Ventures, Telstra Ventures and Voyage Capital. To date, Portland, Oregon-based Elemental boasts more than 700 media companies as customers and provides the technology behind over-the-top TV (OTT) applications, including the BBC\u2019s iPlayer, CNNGo, ESPN ScoreCenter, HBO GO, MSNBC Shift, Sky Go and Sky Now. Additionally, Elemental is supporting the world\u2019s first 4K Ultra HD services including those that were delivered by the BBC during the 2014 World Cup.\n\nThe acquisition brings together Elemental\u2019s video technology with the AWS Cloud platform to provide media and entertainment companies with tools to scale video infrastructures more efficiently and more economically, as the media industry increasingly moves to Internet-based delivery. \u201cTogether, we\u2019ll collaborate on deeper technology integrations and new infrastructure offerings so that media and entertainment companies can evolve their hybrid and cloud models as they continue to innovate their services for viewers,\u201d says Andy Jassy, senior vice president of AWS.\n\nSince Seattle, Washington-based Amazon launched AWS in 2006, it has become the leading cloud-computing infrastructure provider in the world, with more one million customers using the services lower information technology costs and scale applications globally. AWS is comprised of a broad set of computing, storage, database, analytics, application, and deployment services from data center located in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, Germany, Ireland, Japan, and Singapore.\n\nTraditionally, Amazon has grown organically or made small acquisitions. The $970 million purchase of Twitch Interactive Inc., an online community of video gamers, in 2014 was a departure from the company\u2019s usual M&A strategy and represents its biggest deal to date.
