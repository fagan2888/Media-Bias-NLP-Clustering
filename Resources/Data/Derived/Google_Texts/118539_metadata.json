Of the eight million people who enrolled in the insurance Marketplaces between October 2013 and March 2014, 85 percent received an advance premium tax credit. This provision allows a three-month grace period for nonpayment of insurance premiums for this group of consumers\u2013and this group only\u2013if they have previously paid at least one month\u2019s full premium in that benefit year.\n\nThis grace period allows these new enrollees continuity of care, preventing them from shifting or \u201cchurning\u201d in and out of coverage for nonpayment. Health care providers, however, have expressed concerns that this provision and the way the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has implemented it could expose them to considerable financial risk. This Health Policy Brief focuses on how this provision is being implemented and the concerns from the provider community.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Law?\n\nBefore the ACA, state laws on outstanding premium payments varied, with many states only offering a thirty-day grace period. This ninety-day provision for consumers receiving advance payment of the premium tax credit applies everywhere in the United States regardless of whether an insurance Marketplace is operated by the state or the federal government. The ACA statute states that if a subsidized enrollee does not pay a premium the insurance issuer must notify the Department of Health and Human Services of such nonpayment and allow a ninety-day grace period.\n\nCMS regulations have further stated that issuers must pay all appropriate claims for medical services rendered to the enrollee during the first month of the grace period and are allowed to put on hold claims for service during the second and third months. The brief also explains the termination and reenrollment process for people who fail to pay premiums once the ninety-day grace period has elapsed.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Debate?\n\nMost criticism about the ninety-day grace period has come from provider organizations, such as hospitals and physician groups. One of those groups\u2013the Medical Group Management Association\u2013released a survey in May 2014 showing that 48 percent of providers who refused to accept Marketplace insurance from patients cited worries about assuming financial liability during the grace period as a reason for their decision.\n\nThe brief also details the concerns of insurers, which prompted CMS to change the regulation from its initial version to allow the delay of payment for claims in the second and third months of the grace period. As the brief also explains, \u201cprompt payment\u201d laws on the books in many states will provide some protection to providers and, to some extent, to insurers.\n\nWhat\u2019s Next?\n\nSince this is the first year of the Marketplaces, only preliminary data from a few states exist about the impact of the ninety-day grace period. In the interim, the American Medical Association has created resources for its members to deal with its potential consequences.\n\nSome providers have recommended providing assistance for patients so they can maintain coverage and avoid the grace period in the first place. This issue is likely to evolve in the future as more information about how likely patients who have signed up for subsidized coverage become delinquent on their payments.\n\nABOUT HEALTH POLICY BRIEFS\n\nHealth Policy Briefs are aimed at policy makers, congressional staffers, and others who need short, jargon-free explanations of health policy basics.

In fact, CMS has indicated that issuers must inform providers.
