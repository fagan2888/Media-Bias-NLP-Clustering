Huh. Then I must have been hallucinating last month at a Cruz event in Iowa where several of his hand-picked supporters, who spoke just before him, mocked and dismissed Donald Trump\u2019s professed Christianity.\n\nThey marveled at a past comment of Trump\u2019s about never asking God for forgiveness. One of them chose a bizarre, religiously coded analogy for a boast Trump had just made about how much voters loved him, saying that the billionaire\u2019s bragging was an echo of John Lennon\u2019s infamous claim \u2014 an outrage to American Christians in the 1960s \u2014 that the Beatles were more popular than Jesus.\n\nBut no, Cruz\u2019s campaign would never question the faith of another candidate.\n\nThe Texas senator is some piece of double-talking, disingenuous work. While the so-called dirty tricks that he and his lieutenants have been charged with aren\u2019t all that shocking by the standards of bruising presidential campaigns, they really do stand out in the context of Cruz\u2019s flamboyant claims of rectitude and righteousness.\n\nHe directs you to his halo as he surreptitiously grabs a pitchfork. His rivals aren\u2019t so diabolically hypocritical.\n\nAt a town hall in South Carolina that CNN televised, he answered a question about his miserable relations with fellow lawmakers in Washington by assuring voters that \u201cit\u2019s not that I speak with a lack of civility or respect.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bible talks about if someone treats you unkindly, repay them with kindness,\u201d he added. \u201cThat has been the standard I\u2019ve tried to follow. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve approached it in the Senate. So I have not attacked or insulted my colleagues in the Senate, Democrat or Republican.\u201d\n\nIs he suffering from delusions? Amnesia? On the Senate floor he called Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, a liar. He also likened Senate Republicans who recognized the impossibility of defunding Obamacare to Nazi appeasers.\n\nAnd where was that \u201ccivility or respect\u201d at subsequent Senate hearings to confirm Chuck Hagel as the secretary of defense? Cruz\u2019s repeated suggestions that Hagel had been corrupted by money from America\u2019s enemies were so out of bounds that senators from both parties were appalled.\n\nCruz continues to congratulate his campaign for its high-mindedness even though his allies and operatives spread an erroneous report, during the Iowa caucuses, that Ben Carson was dropping out of the race. And they had the niftiest bit of counsel for Carson voters. Switch to Cruz!\n\nThen, in South Carolina, Cruz operatives doctored a photograph so that it showed Rubio shaking hands with Obama in front of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThese shenanigans profoundly contradict the godly styling of a candidate who was the first ever to announce a presidential campaign at Liberty University, the largest Christian university in the world, and who incessantly invokes the Bible, Jesus and morality.\n\nAnd they surely reflect the campaign culture that Cruz has created. Political allies and aides tend to behave in a manner largely consistent with their boss\u2019 directives and understood values.\n\nOr they\u2019re brought aboard a campaign because they behave that way. As Matt Flegenheimer reported in The New York Times last week, Cruz hired a campaign manager, Jeff Roe, who is widely known for destructive gossip, for malicious tactics \u2014 and for winning.\n\nCruz\u2019s hypocrisy may be catching up with him. In Iowa, he drew more evangelical Christian voters than his rivals did, but in South Carolina, Trump beat him among those voters, and Rubio wasn\u2019t far behind. Some of them told reporters, including me, that they\u2019d been turned off by behavior of Cruz\u2019s that they deemed un-Christian.\n\nThis dynamic could cripple him in the Southern states that vote in the first half of March, and his strategy hinges on those states.\n\nWith their evangelical voters in mind, he frames himself as the candidate truest to Scripture and fiercest in the battle against such scourges (in his estimation) as gay marriage. That framing implicitly questions rivals\u2019 devotion.\n\nAnd his onetime proclamation that \u201cany president who doesn\u2019t begin every day on his knees isn\u2019t fit to be commander-in-chief\u201d is a summons to rivals to prove their faith. He should focus instead on conduct that proves his own.", "article_metadata": {"description": "When Ted Cruz announced last week that he was firing his campaign\u2019s communications director for circulating a false insinuation that Marco Rubio had belittled the Bible, he told reporters, \u201cEven if it was true, we are not a campaign that is going to question the faith of another candidate.\u201d Really?
