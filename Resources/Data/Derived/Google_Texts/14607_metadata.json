Darrell Issa, R-Calif., chairman of the House committee, asked him and Marilyn Tavenner, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service administrator, to appear and answer questions on repeated transparency failures and outright deceptions involving the Affordable Care Act. The hearing will be held Dec. 9 at 9:30 a.m.\n\n\u201cFrom the outset, the health law has been the poster child for this administration\u2019s broken transparency promises,\u201d Issa said in a written statement.\n\n\u201cJonathan Gruber, one of ObamaCare\u2019s chief architects, publicly lauded the \u2018lack of transparency\u2019 that was necessary to pass the law and credited \u2018the stupidity of the American voter\u2019 that allowed the administration to mislead the public,\u201d Issa said. He added, \u201cCMS Administrator Marilyn Tavenner testified before our Committee that the administration met its goals by enrolling 7.3 million individuals; however, we now know that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d\n\nIssa says the numbers provided by CMS were deceptive and wants both Gruber and Tavenner to explain themselves.\n\nAlthough Obama has downplayed Gruber's role in crafting the Affordable Care Act, White House logs show he visited 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. more than a dozen times and was paid $400,000 for his work on the project. That followed several years of work with the state of Massachusetts, where a universal health care system implemented under former Gov. Mitt Romney has been hailed as the model for ObamaCare.\n\nSince the passage of ObamaCare, eight states, including Vermont and North Carolina, gave Gruber's firm six-figure contracts to create computer models, crunch numbers and analyze data to help them implement the law. But those two states have now canned Gruber and canceled the deals in the wake of a spate of videos showing the loose-lipped academic saying the law was written in an intentionally obtuse manner and crediting \u201cthe stupidity of the American voter\u201d with helping pass the law.", "article_metadata": {"classification": "/FOX NEWS/POLITICS/REGULATION/Health Care", "dcterms.modified":
