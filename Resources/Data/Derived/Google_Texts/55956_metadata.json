Before we fund anything else at the federal level, we should be funding national security.\"\n\nRubio received a warm reception in Chattanooga, but he has struggled to break out of a crowded GOP field. Recent polls put his support at 6 percent in Iowa and 5 percent nationally.\n\nZach Wamp, Tennessee campaign chair, said Rubio's Christian worldview matches his own. Wamp said other candidates don't understand national security like Rubio, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nRubio is an attractive candidate to millennial voters and immigrants, Wamp said. Unless the GOP broadens its base, it \"will be in the wilderness for a generation,\" he said.\n\n\"We've got to be the party that's in the windshield and not the rearview mirror,\" he said.\n\nRepublican officials in attendance included state Sens. Todd Gardenhire and Brian Kelsey, Mayor Jim Coppinger, and Sheriff Jim Hammond.\n\nThe candidate was expected to attend a Chattanooga fundraiser later in the day.\n\nRubio is the second presidential candidate to come to Chattanooga. Sen. Ted Cruz was here earlier this month. Dr. Ben Carson will be at a book signing in October.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Chattanooga news, entertainment, opinion, editorials", "og": {"site_name": "Nooga.com", "description": "The 44-year-old Florida senator spoke to more than a hundred supporters at Lindsay Street Hall downtown.", "title": "Marco Rubio campaigns in Chattanooga", "url": "http://nooga.com/170973/marco-rubio-campaigns-in-chattanooga/", "image": "https://noogacms.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/_/93abfb2449fbaad6e5037dbf8cbb1d0264312_large.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://noogacms.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/_/93abfb2449fbaad6e5037dbf8cbb1d0264312_large.jpg", "description": "The 44-year-old Florida senator spoke to more than a hundred supporters at Lindsay Street Hall downtown.", "site": "@NoogaNews", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Marco Rubio campaigns in Chattanooga"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "10861fd2fb15c60793c07348980e295e"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1400280486890380}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/nooga.com", "published_time": "20150904T1154", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/nooga.com"}, "msvalidate.01": "1FCFAF85DD84EF15FE1F984BAA51D8EC", "google-site-verification": "ZV6KJxYZmuIj2xB89lDEfnaBCsDCtzILRcc-orlSZm8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdc78f\"", "article_summary": "Marco Rubio was in Chattanooga Thursday making his pitch to become the Republican presidential nominee in 2016.\nWamp said other candidates don't understand national security like Rubio, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\nRubio received a warm reception in Chattanooga, but he has struggled to break out of a crowded GOP field.\nBefore we fund anything else at the federal level, we should be funding national security.\"\nRubio is the second presidential candidate to come to Chattanooga."}
