Shumlin won't run for fourth term\n\nVermont Gov. Peter Shumlin will not seek reelection in 2016, he announced Monday.\n\nShumlin, who chaired the Democratic Governors Association last cycle, was first elected in 2010 and is serving his third two-year term.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut in the 2014 election, he failed to earn a majority of the vote. The state Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, selected him for another term earlier this year over his Republican challenger, Scott Milne.\n\n\u201cI decided to make this decision now because I want these 18 months in office\u201d to be dedicated to policy work, Shumlin said at a press conference Monday afternoon.\n\nShumlin\u2019s decision to forgo a fourth term comes despite earlier indications that he was leaning toward another run.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to serve for as long as Vermonters will have me and for as long as we\u2019ve still got work left to do. And we\u2019ve got a lot of work left to do,\u201d he told POLITICO in February.\n\nReporters asked the 59-year-old Shumlin on Monday about the high-profile failure of his administration to pass a single-payer health care system in the state. But he expressed hope he could still enact reforms during his final 18 months in office.\n\n\u201cWhat I learned the hard way was that \u2026 you can\u2019t support any health care system if you keep spending money the way we are,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish we could have done the whole package. I think we can get half the loaf. Let\u2019s do that.\u201d\n\nShumlin\u2019s travails on health care came to define his sagging fortunes as he narrowly clung to a lead against Milne. Outraged liberals who once cheered Vermont\u2019s first-in-the-nation embrace of single-payer health care were dismayed when Shumlin shelved it over cost concerns. His administration was also beset by the technical failures of the state\u2019s Obamacare exchange.\n\nShumlin added that he plans to complete his term and won\u2019t accept a job in a Democratic administration. \u201cI will not be going to Washington,\u201d he said.\n\nRepublicans were excited about the potential of taking on a damaged Shumlin in 2016 but may be less eager to do battle with a fresh face. If he decides to run, Lt. Gov. Phil Scott would likely be the leading GOP candidate. The Republican Governors Association has talked to Scott about a potential run.\n\n\u201cYou always consider,\u201d Scott told WCAX-TV earlier this month. \u201cYou know, the last time around I was fairly clear early on I had no interest in running. At this point in time I\u2019m going to give it more thought.\u201d\n\nThe Republican Governors Association, which battled with Shumlin over the course of the 2014 cycle, piled on in a statement emailed to reporters that called Vermont \u201ca strong opportunity\u201d for the committee \u201cto go on offense.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy throwing in the towel after an embarrassing term as DGA chairman and deciding not to seek reelection,\u201d Shumlin \u201cis finally admitting he has failed to be an effective leader for Vermont,\u201d said RGA communications director Jon Thompson. \u201cHis decision adds Vermont to a growing list of open seats the DGA will be forced to spend limited resources on to defend in 2016, and presents a strong opportunity for the RGA to go on offense. Vermont is ready for and deserves new leadership \u2014 a Republican governor who will be able to jumpstart the state\u2019s economy and remind Vermonters what it\u2019s like to live in a well-run state.\u201d\n\nVermonters, despite their liberal reputation, have a history of backing Republicans on the state level: GOP Gov. Jim Douglas served four terms from 2003-2011, and three-term Sen. Jim Jeffords left office less than a decade ago.\n\nDemocratic operatives mentioned Rep. Peter Welch, state House Speaker Shap Smith and former state senator and gubernatorial candidate Matt Dunne as potential 2016 candidates. Welch, who ran for governor in 1990 and is in his fifth House term, released a statement touting Shumlin\u2019s \u201cextraordinary record of service\u201d but didn\u2019t address whether he would be interested in the job.\n\nSmith has already acknowledged his interest in the race, telling the same local television station he would only run if Shumlin decided not to.\n\nAs for Shumlin, he said the 2014 election \u2014 in which he edged Milne on Election Day, 46 percent to 45 percent, before the race was kicked to the Legislature in January \u2014 was \u201cabsolutely not\u201d a factor in deciding not to run again.\n\n\u201cYou know me, I love tough races,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAnd I firmly believe that in a presidential year we would have won big. But we\u2019re never going to find out.\u201d\n\nKyle Cheney and Kevin Robillard contributed to this report.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Shumlin added that he won\u2019t accept a job in a Democratic administration.", "title": "Vermont Gov.
