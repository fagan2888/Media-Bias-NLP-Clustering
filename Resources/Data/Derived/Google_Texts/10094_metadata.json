But White House aides have so far declined to outline what that response might entail, saying they do not want to telegraph their intentions to the North Koreans.\n\nStill, officials told the Journal the response could include an effort to again pursue efforts initially undertaken by the Bush administration that severely restricted the North Korean government\u2019s ability to conduct foreign-exchange transactions.\n\nBush pressured banks in Macau suspected of doing business with Pyongyang, limiting the regime\u2019s ability to access foreign dollars and purchase luxury goods.\n\nBut the former president eased up on that effort and lifted some provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act that restricted trade to North Korea, as part of a deal designed to roll back the country\u2019s nuclear weapons program. Bush\u2019s State Department also removed North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism as part of that effort.\n\nThe deal was criticized by some members of the Democratic Party at the time, and a number of Republican lawmakers, including Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), called on Obama to reimpose the sanctions during appearances on the Sunday talk shows.\n\n\u201cWe need to react and react vigorously, including reimposing sanctions that were lifted under the Bush administration, including other actions and that will squeeze them more economically,\u201d McCain said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) told CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that Obama should \u201cmake it so hard on the North Koreans, they don't want to do this in the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cReimpose sanctions lifted by President Bush. Put them back on the state sponsor of terrorism list. Put China on notice that it's just not a movie. It's our way of life,\u201d Graham said.\n\nSony canceled the debut of \u201cThe Interview\u201d \u2014 a comedy that depicts the assassination of Kim Jong Un \u2014 after the hack and a subsequent threat of a Sept. 11-style attacks.\n\nIn addition to the economic sanctions, the White House is weighing whether to again place North Korea on the state sponsors of terrorism list. That designation bans arms-related exports and sales to a country, prohibits economic assistance, and puts additional restrictions and requirements on financial transactions and exports.\n\n\u201cWe're going to review those through a process that's already in place,\u201d Obama said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cWe've got very clear criteria as to what it means for a state to sponsor terrorism. And we don't make those judgments just based on the news of the day. We look systematically at what's been done and based on those facts, we'll make those determinations in the future.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. appears to be ratcheting up pressure on China to intervene over the hacking case. The Chinese foreign ministry on Monday said Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Secretary of State John Kerry spoke about the Sony hack over the phone.\n\nChinese spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters that China was prepared to work with the international community to promote cybersecurity, according to state news agency Xinhua.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The sanctions would be in response to the hack on Sony.", "description": "The sanctions would be in response to the hack on Sony.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Justin Sink", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The sanctions would be in response to the hack on Sony.", "title": "Obama weighs sanctions against North Korea", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/227839-obama-weighs-sanctions-against-north-korea", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/thehill_logo_200.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-12-22T10:31:00-05:00", "type": "article"}, "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2014-12-22T10:31-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/227839-obama-weighs-sanctions-against-north-korea", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "dcterms.date": "2014-12-22T09:36-05:00", "dcterms.creator": "Ian Swanson", "dcterms.type": "Text", "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-22T09:36:55-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-22T10:31:00-05:00"}, "keywords": "Sony,Barack Obama,", "dcterms.language": "und", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/227839-obama-weighs-sanctions-against-north-korea", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The sanctions would be in response to the hack on Sony.", "card": "summary", "title": "Obama weighs sanctions against North Korea"}, "dcterms.title": "Obama weighs sanctions against North Korea"}, "article_summary": "In addition to the economic sanctions, the White House is weighing whether to again place North Korea on the state sponsors of terrorism list.\nBush\u2019s State Department also removed North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism as part of that effort.\nThe sanctions would be in retaliation for the cyberattack against Sony Pictures, senior administration officials told The Wall Street Journal.\nADVERTISEMENTPresident Obama has repeatedly vowed a \u201cproportional response\u201d to what he described on Sunday as the \u201ccyber vandalism\u201d undertaken against Sony.\nPut them back on the state sponsor of terrorism list."}
