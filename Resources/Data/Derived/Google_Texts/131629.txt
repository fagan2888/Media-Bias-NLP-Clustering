Lawmakers and regulators are signaling that this year may bring a crackdown on employers who misclassify workers as contractors or freelancers, when in fact their tasks are identical to regular employees.

“Misclassification” of workers became a hot issue last year after Georgia-based Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet was hit with a $2 million lawsuit for misclassifying restaurant servers as independent contractors. The U.S. Department of Labor filed several other, similar lawsuits in 2013, under provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
