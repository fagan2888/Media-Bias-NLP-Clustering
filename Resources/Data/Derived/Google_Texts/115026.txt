Call them the bandwagon stocks.

Credit Suisse analysts tracked what it describes as the large-cap rising stars, or the US large-cap stocks where large-cap fund ownership rose the most during the second quarter.

Five financial firms made it onto the list, including Goldman Sachs, Prudential Financial and Bank of New York Mellon.

Other notables names include Amazon, Goodyear Tire and Rubber and Darden Restaurants.

Credit Suisse also singled out Facebook as a stock to watch out for.
