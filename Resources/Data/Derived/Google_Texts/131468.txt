Andre Burakovsky scored in the first period, and Braden Holtby and Pheonix Copley combined for a shutout in the Washington Capitals’ 1-0 victory over the Buffalo Sabres on Sunday night in the exhibition opener for both teams.

Washington coach Barry Trotz won in his first game with the team. He mixed veterans — including Holtby and Alex Ovechkin — with prospects, while Buffalo’s Ted Nolan used a relatively inexperienced lineup.

Copley stopped six shots in the first period, and Holtby made 19 saves over the final 40 minutes. Nathan Lieuwen made 24 saves for the Sabres.
