(WWLP) \u2013 Millions of your tax dollars, gone. The state auditor\u2019s office found nearly $14 million in public assistance benefits fraud in 2015. It included people and groups defrauding the state of food stamp benefits, EBT cards, childcare services and health care.\n\nThat $14 million lost marks a 44% increase from the $9.5 million the state lost to fraud in 2014. State Auditor Suzanne Bump says that this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that more people are filing fraudulent claims. What she says, though, is that it reflects a more effectiveness of her office identifying fraudulent behavior.\n\n22News called the state auditor\u2019s office to find out if the state can get that money back, or if criminal charges will be brought. We were told that if examiners identify a fraud suspect, the office will attempt to get that money back. The state determines whether to pursue criminal charges on a case by case basis. Auditor\u2019s Office Spokesman Mike Wessler told 22News charging someone with a felony could get them fired, and force them to go back on benefits.\n\n\u201cI think everybody has to follow the law and I think fraud is against all moral codes,\u201d says West Springfield resident Ilie Cojocrau, \u201cso everyone should be punished according to the law. But they should pay a price, you know? At least return the money that they scammed.\u201d\n\nThe Bureau of Special Investigations is now working with other state agencies to find instances of welfare fraud.", "article_metadata": {"bing-site-verification": "23CDEE3A27AFAAFA06AA97D2752E7BC3", "news_keywords": "ebt, card, cards, fraud, fraudulent, money, welfare, benefit, benefits, waste, wasted, dollars, million, millions, 14, government, state, auditor, auditors, office, found, investigate, assistance, 2015, percent, stamp, food, health, care, child, service, services", "generator": "WordPress.com", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.linmedia.newstouch.wwlp", "og": {"site_name": "WWLP.com", "description": "Millions of dollars were wasted in 2015 on welfare fraud. 22News found out how all that money was lost, and if the state can get it back.", "title": "$14M of your tax dollars wasted on people committing fraud", "url": "http://wwlp.com/2016/02/03/14-million-of-your-tax-dollars-wasted-on-people-committing-fraud/", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "https://lintvwwlp.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/ebt.jpg", "height": 366}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Millions of dollars were wasted in 2015 on welfare fraud. 22News found out how all that money was lost, and if the state can get it back.", "title": "$14M of your tax dollars wasted on people committing fraud", "image": {"src": "https://lintvwwlp.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/ebt.jpg?w=640"}, "creator": "@WWLP22News", "site": "WWLP22News", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Western Massachusetts Breaking News, Weather", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=488537620", "fb": {"pages": 16780999098}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wwlp.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/82beb0f66fcee4174912ea30f52087cc?s=16", "application-name": "WWLP.com", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WWLP22News", "published_time": "2016-02-04T04:13:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-04T04:39:28+00:00"}, "keywords": "breaking news, weather, investigative reports, springfield news, chicopee news, northampton news, amherst news, greenfield news, hampshire county, hampden county, berkshires, Connecticut river valley, pioneer valley, westfield news, western massachusetts, national news, headlines, online, nbc news", "google-site-verification": "6YJPKhiEei9MITNyJe-rDmtJtJ8OhKZ_QWocROYaWIU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Millions of dollars were wasted in 2015 on welfare fraud. 22News found out how all that money was lost, and if the state can get it back."}, "article_summary": "That $14 million lost marks a 44% increase from the $9.5 million the state lost to fraud in 2014.\nThe state auditor\u2019s office found nearly $14 million in public assistance benefits fraud in 2015.\n22News called the state auditor\u2019s office to find out if the state can get that money back, or if criminal charges will be brought.\nWe were told that if examiners identify a fraud suspect, the office will attempt to get that money back.\nAuditor\u2019s Office Spokesman Mike Wessler told 22News charging someone with a felony could get them fired, and force them to go back on benefits."}
