Ditto ObamaCare (If you like your doctor . . . ).\n\nNow, we learn that Justice Department lawyers appear to have been misleading the courts on immigration deportations. Note: that's lawyers in a department called the Justice Department. An editorial in the Wall Street Journal explains:\n\nThe constitutional challenge to President Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration keeps getting more remarkable. A federal judge has now exposed how the Justice Department systematically deceived lower courts about the Administration\u2019s conduct, and he has imposed unprecedented legal measures to attempt to sterilize this ethics rot.\n\nOn Thursday District Judge Andrew Hanen of Texas found that Obama Administration lawyers committed misconduct that he called \u201cintentional, serious and material.\u201d In 2015 he issued an injunction\u2014now in front of the Supreme Court\u2014blocking Mr. Obama\u2019s 2014 order that rewrote immigration law to award legal status and federal and state benefits to nearly five million aliens.\n\nWhen 26 states sued to block the order in December 2014, Justice repeatedly assured Judge Hanen that the Department of Homeland Security would not start processing applications until February 2015 at the earliest. Two weeks after the injunction came down, in March, Justice was forced to admit that DHS had already granted or renewed more than 100,000 permits.\n\nJustice has also conceded in legal filings that all its lawyers knew all along that the DHS program was underway, despite what they said in briefs and hearings. One DOJ lawyer told Judge Hanen that \u201cI really would not expect anything between now and the date of the hearing.\u201d As the judge notes, \u201cHow the government can categorize the granting of over 100,000 applications as not being \u2018anything\u2019 is beyond comprehension.\u201d\n\nJustice\u2019s only explanation is that its lawyers either \u201clost focus on the fact\u201d or \u201cthe fact receded in memory or awareness\u201d\u2014the fact here being realities that the DOJ was required to disclose to the court. The states weren\u2019t able to make certain arguments or seek certain legal remedies because the program supposedly hadn\u2019t been implemented, leaving them in a weaker legal position.\n\nMore to the point, an attorney\u2019s first and most basic judicial obligation is to tell the truth. Judge Hanen concludes that the misrepresentations \u201cwere made in bad faith\u201d and \u201cit is hard to imagine a more serious, more calculated plan of unethical conduct.\u201d Many a lawyer has been disbarred for less.\n\nJudge Hanen has ordered the Justice Department lawyers to take courses in remedial ethics and asked Attorney General Loretta Lynch to prepare a \"comprehensive plan\" to prevent such behavior in the future. As the editorial observes, this is the kind of oversight we generally associated with companies that show a pattern of corruption.\n\nMost alarming:\n\nMain Justice may have figured that the state challenge would be tossed for lack of standing, and thus its dissembling wouldn\u2019t matter. This would mean that President Obama\u2019s refusal to recognize the legal limits of his executive power has spread a culture of lawlessness among his lawyers too.\n\nThis is both a constitutional and ethics challenge with important ramifications for our system of separation of powers.", "article_metadata": {"description": "A federal judge sends Justice Department lawyers for remedial ethics classes.", "author": "Charlotte Hays", "og": {"url": "http://iwf.org/blog/2800297/Federal-Judge-Finds-Systematic-Deception-on-Part-of-\"Justice\"-Department-Lawyers", "image": "http://i1202.photobucket.com/albums/bb366/IWF11/2016/justice_zpsbc1qtdkh.png", "type": "website", "description": "A federal judge sends Justice Department lawyers for remedial ethics classes.", "title": "Federal Judge Finds Systematic Deception on Part of \"Justice\" Department Lawyers"}, "twitter": {"domain": "http://iwf.org", "description": "A federal judge sends Justice Department lawyers for remedial ethics classes.", "title": "Federal Judge Finds Systematic Deception on Part of \"Justice\" Department Lawyers", "image": {"src": "http://i1202.photobucket.com/albums/bb366/IWF11/2016/justice_zpsbc1qtdkh.png"}, "creator": "@iwf", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "title": "Federal Judge Finds Systematic Deception on Part of \"Justice\" Department Lawyers", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Now, we learn that Justice Department lawyers appear to have been misleading the courts on immigration deportations.\nNote: that's lawyers in a department called the Justice Department.\nJudge Hanen has ordered the Justice Department lawyers to take courses in remedial ethics and asked Attorney General Loretta Lynch to prepare a \"comprehensive plan\" to prevent such behavior in the future.\nHome / Blog / ArticleFederal Judge Finds Systematic Deception on Part of \"Justice\" Department LawyersCharlotte HaysOne reason citizens are so angry is that there just doesn't seem to be any way to call public servants (using word loosely) to account.\nA federal judge has now exposed how the Justice Department systematically deceived lower courts about the Administration\u2019s conduct, and he has imposed unprecedented legal measures to attempt to sterilize this ethics rot."}
