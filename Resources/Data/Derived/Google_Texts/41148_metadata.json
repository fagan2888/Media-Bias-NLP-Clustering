But a brief consolidation phase may have already been completed with today\u2019s announcement that Towers Watson has acquired Liazon for $215 million.\n\nTowers Watson is among several human-capital consulting firms, including Aon Hewitt, Mercer and Bulk Consultants, to have launched private exchanges for active employees in the past 18 months. Six-year-old Liazon is the largest player in the market by one measure: its number of corporate customers. There are 2,400 of them, although the vast majority have fewer than 50 employees. Liazon\u2019s exchange platform is distributed via insurance brokers under either the Bright Choices brand name or as a third-party proprietary exchange.\n\nTowers Watson will continue to offer its own OneExchange platform, which has sought to serve employers with many thousands of employees, and to use the Liazon name in its interactions with brokers.\n\nThe other major stand-alone private-exchange vendor, Bloom Health, was jointly purchased by Health Care Service Corp., Wellpoint and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan in 2011.\n\nOne observer speculates that Towers Watson needed Liazon because developing its active-employee (as opposed to retiree) business has been slow going. \u201cOne could argue that Towers hasn\u2019t been as successful as some of its competitors in that market,\u201d says Chris Condeluci, a health-care attorney with law firm Venable LLP, who has developed a specialty in private-exchange matters.\n\nIndeed, Towers Watson so far has only three corporate clients, averaging 15,000 covered lives each, for OneExchange. Meanwhile, Aon Hewitt recently announced it had lined up 18 corporations with more than 3,000 employees each as customers of its active-employee exchange in 2014, and Mercer said 33 corporate clients with head counts of between 100 and 30,000 will use its platform next year. Buck has said it will be serving five companies with more than 3,000 employees.\n\nTowers Watson has plenty of good reasons for buying Liazon, says Bryce Williams, the firm\u2019s managing director of exchange solutions. \u201cThe market is moving so rapidly, and there\u2019s a sense that a tipping point is being achieved,\u201d he says. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many companies that have been in the active-employee private exchange market for more than a year or two. Liazon has been at it for six years, and there aren\u2019t really any others left with Liazon\u2019s technology capabilities that aren\u2019t owned by someone else. It\u2019s as if the music just stopped and we grabbed the last chair.\u201d Condeluci, for his part, calls Liazon\u2019s technology platform \u201cone of the best in the business.\u201d\n\nTowers Watson got into the exchange business by purchasing Extend Health, a Medicare platform for retirees, in May 2012. Some of Towers\u2019 consulting-firm competitors developed their exchange technology in-house.\n\nThe potential market is certainly broad. There are about 150 million Americans covered by employer-sponsored health insurance, and the market is clearly poised to move in any number of directions. By some estimates, tens of millions of employees could move to private exchanges over the next few years.\n\nWilliams notes that while Liazon\u2019s customer base is still composed mostly of small employers because that was its initial focus, the company is \u201cnow selling to clients with a couple thousand covered lives. It\u2019s going up-market.\u201d\n\nThe larger Liazon accounts won\u2019t be moved to OneExchange. \u201cWe really like the scalability of Liazon\u2019s platform up to 5,000 or maybe 10,000 lives,\u201d Williams says. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking of that as a break point under which the Liazon platform would work beautifully. For us, this is a market complement and a speed-to-market strategy for midsize and small groups. As a global benefits consultant to the Fortune 1,000, Towers Watson has not played in that space.\u201d\n\nLiazon co-founder and CEO Ashok Subramanian will continue to run Liazon, reporting to Williams. Plans are to continue operating it as before. Towers Watson took that approach as well with Extend Health, the retiree exchange business, which is seeing strong growth. \u201cWhen you acquire a company that has intense entrepreneurial speed and spirit, keep that alive and keep that culture going,\u201d Williams says.\n\nWilliams also likes that Liazon has distribution deals with nine of the 10 largest mid-market health insurance brokers and that its platform is set up to serve both fully insured and self-insured employers. \u201cThat was highly attractive to us, because our first platform was built exclusively for self-insured,\u201d he says.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "aon hewitt, ashok subramanian, bloom health, bryce williams, buck consultants, chris condeluci, extend health, liazon, mercer, oneexchange, private exchanges, towers watson", "generator": "Easy Digital Downloads v2.2.2", "author": "David McCann", "og": {"site_name": "CFO", "description": "Towers Watson's purchase of private health insurance exchange player Liazon completes a brief consolidation phase for the active-employee segment of that market.", "title": "Towers Watson Buys Private Health Insurance Exchange Player Liazon", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2013-11-22T18:23:09+00:00", "url": "http://ww2.cfo.com/health-benefits/2013/11/private-health-exchange-market-consolidates/", "type": "article"}, "media": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "CFO", "description": "Towers Watson's purchase of private health insurance exchange player Liazon completes a brief consolidation phase for the active-employee segment of that market.", "creator": "@cfo", "title": "Towers Watson Buys Private Health Insurance Exchange Player Liazon", "site": "@cfo", "card": "summary", "account_id": 44906914}, "topicRoot": "Human Capital & Careers", "topic": "Health Benefits", "headline": "Private Health-Exchange Market Consolidates", "fb": {"admins": 15609421}, "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Private Health-Exchange Market Consolidates\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.cfo.com\\/health-benefits\\/2013\\/11\\/private-health-exchange-market-consolidates\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2013-11-22 17:14:40\",\"mod_date\":\"2013-11-22 18:23:09\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":23462,\"author_id\":\"6\",\"author_name\":null,\"author_display_name\":\"David McCann\",\"tags\":[\"Aon Hewitt\",\"Ashok Subramanian\",\"Bloom Health\",\"Bryce Williams\",\"Buck Consultants\"],\"categories\":[\"Applications\",\"Growth Companies\",\"Health Benefits\",\"Human Capital &amp; Careers\",\"Staffing\"],\"image\":null}", "date": 20131122, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CFOConferences", "section": "Technology", "tag": "Towers Watson", "published_time": "2013-11-22T17:14:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2013-11-22T18:23:09+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Towers Watson's purchase of private health insurance exchange player Liazon completes a brief consolidation phase for the active-employee segment of that market."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fce988\"", "article_summary": "Liazon\u2019s exchange platform is distributed via insurance brokers under either the Bright Choices brand name or as a third-party proprietary exchange.\nTowers Watson expands its exchange business into the midsized and small markets with its purchase of Liazon, a major player in the space.\nOne observer speculates that Towers Watson needed Liazon because developing its active-employee (as opposed to retiree) business has been slow going.\nTowers Watson took that approach as well with Extend Health, the retiree exchange business, which is seeing strong growth.\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many companies that have been in the active-employee private exchange market for more than a year or two."}
