The majority of that money would be set aside for veterans to seek medical care outside of the VA system if they cannot get an appointment within the promised window of 14 days. In addition, the bill contains the major GOP priority of granting the secretary of Veterans\u2019 Affairs the power to fire bureaucrats who are simply not doing their jobs.\n\n\u201cThe two principles, particularly the expanded firing authority and the expanded access to private care are the two most important reforms in this bill. We feel they will lay the groundwork for future VA reform in fundamentally transforming how the VA delivers care and benefits to our veterans,\u201d said Dan Caldwell, issues and legislative campaign manager at Concerned Veterans for America.\n\nListen to the WND/Radio America interview with Dan Caldwell:\n\nWhile he believes both of those components are essential to any meaningful reform, Caldwell said the greater choice in health-care options for veterans is the most important reform.\n\n\u201cWe think that allowing veterans more health-care choices will improve their overall well-being, will get veterans out of this failing single-payer health-care system at the VA and ultimately reduce wait time,\u201d said Caldwell, who believes transferring more and more of veterans\u2019 medical needs to the private sector is a worthy goal.\n\n\u201cWe think that a lot of these health-care services, particularly on the primary care front, could probably be better served within the private sector at a family doctor or primary care physician. We don\u2019t think this is really a mission change from what VA\u2019s original intent was. We think this was a mission intent change from where the VA\u2019s mission has expanded in recent decades,\u201d he said.\n\nConcerned Veterans for America is also cheering the plan to give more latitude to the secretary of Veterans\u2019 Affairs to remove personnel at the upper levels for incompetence or nonperformance. It\u2019s a power he hopes the incoming secretary will use widely.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll probably have fire thousands of managers throughout the VA,\u201d Caldwell said. \u201cThe rot at that institution is just so widespread. It is just so ingrained, culturally, within that institution that you\u2019re going to need to remove a lot of people from the VA and then fundamentally transform the culture.\u201d\n\nSen. Sanders insisted on including a 21-day window for any dismissed employees to challenge their firing. Caldwell said this will make it harder to clean house and that problem is already taking shape.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing often with these employees is that it takes two years to fire someone. We\u2019re not talking about low-level employees. We\u2019re talking about senior managers. It should be very easy to remove those people from their positions,\u201d he said, noting the problem removing one of the most infamous people associated with this scandal.\n\n\u201cOut in Phoenix, Arizona, where the scandal broke, Sharon Helman is the hospital director that was responsible directly or indirectly for the deaths of up to 40 veterans as the result of manipulated wait lists. The process to fire her began the day (former Veterans\u2019 Affairs Secretary Gen. Eric) Shinseki resigned. She\u2019s still on the payroll,\u201d Caldwell said.\n\n\u201cTwo other people that started to be fired are still on the payroll. They\u2019ve been receiving pay now for close to two months as employees of the VA. They\u2019re going to drag it out as long as they can because they have the incentive to. I think that this new accountability reform will remove that attempt to drag it out, said Caldwell, noting that government unions will likely challenge the new policy but ultimately lose in court.\u201d\n\nCaldwell said Concerned Veterans for America is very worried about the spending associated with the legislation, not only the amounts designated for the key reforms but also for what he considers unnecessary add-ons. Ultimately, he said there will need to be very close oversight from Congress, the media and many others because the VA still hasn\u2019t learned its lessons.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still not being forthcoming with Congress. They\u2019re not being forthcoming with the media,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re not providing requested information. The VA conference committee needed detailed accounting information from the VA to give to the Congressional Budget Office. The VA gave them complete information. It\u2019s going to require a lot of continued focus \u2026 to make sure this organization is transformed.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "A Free Press For A Free People Since 1997", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.1", "og": {"site_name": "WND", "description": "A leading veterans group is hailing two key provisions of the proposed Veterans Affairs reform bill as critical to improving care for our nation\u2019s heroes but warns that spending needs to be controlled and oversight must be even more intense to make sure positive changes are really happening.
