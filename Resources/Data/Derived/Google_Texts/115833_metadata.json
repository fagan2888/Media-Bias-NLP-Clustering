To get noticed, companies have to pull out all the stops.\n\nSome are hosting boozy cruises to St.Tropez, others arranging private serenades from top music artists for potential clients. And there are, of course, plenty of VIP dinners at the tony H\u00f4tel du Cap. Then there\u2019s some more zany stunts, a few of which we list below:\n\n1. Mobile ad tech company Opera Media is offering thrill-seeking ad buyers rides on water propelled jetpacks. Yes, JetPacks! The invite reads: \u201cCannes is a place known for Opulence. Huge Yachts, upscale shopping, fancy cars and Monte Carlo just down the coast. How do you go bigger than all of this? Jetpacks, of course.\u201d The so called flyboarding are water jetpacks that allow you to dive out of the water and fly around like a real jetpack.\n\nSays Scott Swanson, Opera\u2019s global head of advertiser services: \u201cGoogle, Facebook, Twitter, and other large media conglomerates will have celebrity DJ\u2019s and performers, and many will have an entire beach rented for the week.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have to be much more clever in our approach, as our marketing budgets aren\u2019t quite as sizable, but it\u2019s Cannes, so we have to match the mood.\u201d\n\n2. True X Media, an ad network, rented three helicopters that the company used to shuttle VIPs into Cannes from the Nice airport. \u201cThere is big value from us being there,\u201d said Sean Finnegan, chief strategy officer at True X \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity to present yourself to brands and agencies,\u201d he added. Mr. Finnegan said his firm has been plotting its Cannes festivities for about nine months.\n\nSome companies are making noise with clever but useful giveaways. Facebook, for example, has pleased the female contingent with a to-go cup specifically made for carrying one\u2019s rose up and down la Croisette.\n\nMeanwhile, Yahoo, is offering attendees help with making their Cannes stay just a bit easier. For VIPs, Yahoo is offering the so called \u201cYahoo Purple Service,\u201d which is a concierge service that gives the lucky few amenities such as local transportation, someone to run errands and make last minute dinner reservations and even delivery of forgotten essentials such as phone chargers. But Yahoo didn\u2019t forget the non-VIPers. Its providing plenty of Yahoo-branded Pedicabs that can help attendees trek up and down la Croisette.", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "page.content.source": "Blog Article", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "blogs article", "twitter": {"domain": "WSJ.com", "title": "How To Break Through The Cannes Ad Festival Clutter", "url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/06/16/how-to-break-through-the-cannes-ad-festival-clutter/", "image": {"src": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DG663_CMOYah_P_20140616094632.jpg"}, "site": "WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.image_count": 2, "article_privilege": "free", "article.section": "CSuite", "article.headline": "How To Break Through The Cannes Ad Festival Clutter", "article_section": "CSuite", "author": "Suzanne Vranica", "user.type": "unsubscribed", "article.page": "CMO Today Blog", "page.content.format": "responsive", "page.subsection": "CMO Today", "page.site": "blogs.wsj.com", "testkeys": "C", "article.published": "2014-06-16T15:03:02-04:00", "dj.asn": "10-140", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/06/16/how-to-break-through-the-cannes-ad-festival-clutter/", "app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj"}, "article_id": "BL-269B-865", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "CSuite", "language": "en-US", "og": {"url": "http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/06/16/how-to-break-through-the-cannes-ad-festival-clutter/", "site_name": "WSJ", "image": {"width": 749, "identifier": "http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-DG663_CMOYah_P_20140616094632.jpg", "height": 499}, "type": "article", "title": "How To Break Through The Cannes Ad Festival Clutter"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "CMO Today", "article.id": "BL-269B-865", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2014-06-16T15:05:03-04:00"}, "article_summary": "True X Media, an ad network, rented three helicopters that the company used to shuttle VIPs into Cannes from the Nice airport.\nMobile ad tech company Opera Media is offering thrill-seeking ad buyers rides on water propelled jetpacks.\nHundreds of media companies, ad-tech firms and consulting outfits are attending the Cannes Lion advertising festival this week, each hoping to grab the attention of deep-pocketed marketers.\nJetpacks, of course.\u201d The so called flyboarding are water jetpacks that allow you to dive out of the water and fly around like a real jetpack.\nMeanwhile, Yahoo, is offering attendees help with making their Cannes stay just a bit easier."}
