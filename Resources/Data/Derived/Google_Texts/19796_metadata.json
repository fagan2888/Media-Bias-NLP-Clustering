He was interested in articles on the volatility in Ferguson, Mo., after a white police officer shot to death an unarmed black teenager.\n\n\u201cWe want to encourage reading, listening, speaking \u2013 advanced scholars discussing rigorous text,\u201d the University of Colorado Boulder grad said.\n\nOne challenge is finding different texts for students based on where they\u2019re at academically. Amouzou said his students range from elementary to high-school level in proficiency, and he\u2019ll need to find different material suitable for those at different ends of the spectrum and points in between.\n\nNo-nonsense, regimented charter schools such as STRIVE \u2013 where students wear uniforms and follow rules about raising their hands \u2013 are known for traditional, nuts-and-bolts curriculum. Students stay extra hours to drill deeper into reading, writing and math.\n\nBut the Socratic Seminar demonstrates that teaching approaches at the school go beyond that. A more recent addition to the curriculum, the eighth-grade seminar is also an example of how classrooms nationwide are changing as states adopt more rigorous standards and clear expectations for what students should know from kindergarten through high school graduation, and build up critical thinking.\n\nSTRIVE CEO Chris Gibbons said the seminar was adopted over the past couple of years as the charter school network approached the transition to Colorado Academic Standards. The state\u2019s standards are aligned with Common Core, the multi-state effort to get students on the same page standard-wise that has become increasingly controversial and polarizing as it moves closer to being fully realized.\n\nGibbons explained that the shift to the Socratic Seminar and similar techniques seek to build student engagement and answer the Common Core State Standards\u2019 call for \u201cReading, writing, and speaking grounded in evidence from texts, both literary and informational.\u201d\n\nSTRIVE\u2019s curriculum changes are broad, Gibbons said. One new curricula, History Alive, uses hands-on activities, game-like reading challenges and online multiple choice tests with automated scoring.\n\nHere\u2019s a snippet from a middle-school writing assignment on Andrew Jackson, from its publisher TCI:\n\nStudents read detailed information about Jackson\u2019s policy of forced removal of American Indians, then complete a \u201cletter to the editor\u201d using persuasive writing to protest the removal of The Cherokees.\n\nStudents are asked to use specific evidence from the text regarding the physical and emotional hardships the Cherokee people faced during this time.\n\nStudents create written dialogue to reflect the feelings of the common people and upper class regarding Jackson\u2019s journey from the frontier to the White House.\n\nFinally, students create a commemorative plaque and a \u201cwanted\u201d poster to evaluate how well Andrew Jackson promoted democracy. This writing exercise assists students with analyzing and identifying the positive and negative contributions of Jackson to American democracy.\n\nGibbons said STRIVE schools adopted new internal assessments that align with the new standards and the tests coming this spring developed by a consortium of states known as PARCC (for Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers). That switch \u2013 a year ahead of time \u2013 is one reason Gibbons believes STRIVE\u2019s state standardized test scores dropped in the last TCAP results.\n\nIn case you missed it, here\u2019s a link to our recent story about the STRIVE network\u2019s setbacks in this year\u2019s state standardized tests and how the schools\u2019 leadership is responding.\n\nEric Gorski covers education for The Denver Post.
