In a rambling and at times incoherent press conference, President Obama blamed his staff, government red tape, the government IT procurement process, and himself for the ObamaCare rollout debacle. Obama closed the painful hour with an attack on the media for not covering what has gone right:

We're gonna keep on pushing to make sure it gets done. Am I going to have to do something to rebuild confidence around some of our initiatives? Yeah. But part of my job is, the things that go right, you guys aren't going to write about. The things that go wrong get prominent attention. That's how it's always been. That's not unique to me as president, and I'm up to the challenge.

The president did not offer examples of what has gone right with ObamaCare, other than 106,000 enrollees in the month of October. That number was, though, well below the White House low-end estimate. It was also one nrollee for every 50 Americans who have had their insurance plans canceled.
