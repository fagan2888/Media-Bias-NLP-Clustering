Huh)\n\n3979914\n\nObama could learn a few lessons in marketing from the evil capitalists.\n\nSony seems to have found the recipe for selling products. Their rollout of the PlayStation 4 (and all the previous PlayStations) has been practically flawless. In light of the Obamacare rollout debacle and my expertise as a management consultant, I figured I could give America\u2019s president a lesson in capitalism.\n\nHere\u2019s a short list of six things Obama could learn from the Sony PlayStation 4 debut:\n\n1. Have a good product\n\nIt should go without saying, but step one to capitalist success is to have a product that people actually want. Apparently people want Playstations. They also want iPhones and they like using Travelocity and Amazon, all things Obama has mentioned in his speeches in comparison to Obamacare. Unlike Obamacare, when ordering from these organizations, you get what you pay for.\n\nNo matter how much Obama tries to associate Obamacare with highly sought-after products, it remains a pig on ice. High costs, higher deductibles and co-pays make Obamacare the black sheep, pun intended, of universal healthcare.\n\nOut of the 308 million Americans, Obamacare debuted with a whopping 100 thousand enrollees in six weeks. The administration admits they were expecting five times that amount.\n\nLet\u2019s compare ObamaCare\u2019s coming out to the iPhone, as reported in the Guardian.\n\nThe new iPhone 5S and iPhone 5 made Apple the top smartphone seller in the U.S. in September, despite only being on sale for 10 days of the month.\n\nNew data from Counterpoint Research provided exclusively to the Guardian shows that Apple sold 4.8m phones there in September, jumping to a 38 percent share of the entire U.S. smartphone market for the month. The figures include sales of the new iPhone 5S and 5C, which went on sale on September 20th.\n\nToo bad Obamacare could not be marketed with a free iPhone.\n\nObamacare compares just as dismally to other consumer products, and people are not forced to buy them. The lesson here is the majority of the people did NOT want ObamaCare. 85 percent of the population were insured. Obama unilaterally deemed these existing policies \u201cjunk insurance\u201d plans, apparently based on his extensive knowledge of sports.\n\n2. Know your market\n\nIt\u2019s good to know your market when you launch a product. Sony had an embedded market, but they didn\u2019t presume they would necessarily maintain their market share.\n\nSony test-marketed their PlayStation 4, and correctly anticipated the reaction, reported CNN.\n\nShoppers lined up outside many stores across the country for a special midnight debut of the system, hoping to grab up one of the limited supply. Analysts expect the demand for the system to outstrip supply through Christmas. Sony\u2019s forecast is that it will sell 5 million of the PlayStation 4s by the end of March.\n\nObamacare had no market. The plan was to pilfer the existing market in the style of a drug dealer taking over a new territory \u2014 by force. Obama and his minions got the polling data, which were lethargic to say the least. They disregarded reality, and launched a product whose only hope of survival was to mandate that people buy it.", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "Kevin Jackson", "description": "It helps to have a product people want to buy", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Caller", "description": "Obama could learn a few lessons in marketing from the evil capitalists.
