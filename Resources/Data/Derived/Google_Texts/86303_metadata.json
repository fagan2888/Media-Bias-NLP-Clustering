But Bell offers a pragmatic approach to working with Republicans, a plus in both this fall\u2019s contested general election and in Congress, should he win the seat now occupied by Rep. Sam Johnson.\n\nHe and his opponent, tech executive Michael Filak, 59, share many of the same views. They both urge a higher minimum wage, oppose cuts to Social Security and believe climate change is a serious threat to Texas. They support President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievements, Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms.\n\nBut Bell stands out in part because of his willingness to challenge his party\u2019s orthodoxy. For instance, he says small bankers he works with have convinced him that Dodd-Frank reforms have fallen too heavily on small lenders. He\u2019d like to work with Republicans to change that.\n\nHe also cites rising premiums as one unintended consequence of Obamacare, and is open to building on that law to rein in the cost of care.\n\nFilak cites his global perspective as a game-changer, but we aren\u2019t convinced his two years in Thailand make the difference in this race. Still, his campaign has shown energy and his positions are thoughtful. But Bell is the superior choice.", "article_metadata": {"description": "He and his opponent share similar views, but Bell promises to bring a more pragmatic approach to governing.", "og": {"description": "He and his opponent share similar views, but Bell promises to bring a more pragmatic approach to governing.", "title": "Editorial: We recommend Adam Bell in Democratic race for 3rd Congressional District", "url": "http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20160129-editorial-we-recommend-adam-bell-in-democratic-race-for-3rd-congressional-district.ece", "image": {"width": 1700, "identifier": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20160127-vote2016.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/Vote2016.jpg", "height": 1129}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "type": "article"}, "LastModifiedDate": "2016-01-29T19:34:19Z", "twitter": {"site": "@dallasnews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@dallasnews"}, "PublishDate": "2016-01-29T19:18:32Z", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Editorial: We recommend Adam Bell in Democratic race for 3rd Congressional District\", \"link\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20160129-editorial-we-recommend-adam-bell-in-democratic-race-for-3rd-congressional-district.ece\", \"image_url\": \"http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20160127-vote2016.jpg.ece/BINARY/original/Vote2016.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"2629333\", \"pub_date\": \"2016-01-29T19:18:32Z\", \"section\": \"Editorials\", \"author\": \"\", \"tags\": [\"dallas\", \"dallas fort worth\", \"dallas news\", \"dallas fort worth news\", \"dfw news\", \"dallas local news\", \"dallas fort worth local news\", \"dallas newspaper\", \"dallas morning news\", \"dallas morning news newspaper\"]}", "fb": {"admins": 1043783589, "page_id": 20946638799, "app_id": 258290334265148}, "keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"image": "http://www.dallasnews.com/incoming/20160127-vote2016.jpg.ece/ALTERNATES/w660/Vote2016.jpg", "publishtime": "2016-01-29T19:18:32Z"}}, "news_keywords": "dallas, dallas fort worth, dallas news, dallas fort worth news, dfw news, dallas local news, dallas fort worth local news, dallas newspaper, dallas morning news, dallas morning news newspaper"}, "article_summary": "Adam Bell is our choice for Democrats voting in the 3rd Congressional District primary.\nFor instance, he says small bankers he works with have convinced him that Dodd-Frank reforms have fallen too heavily on small lenders.\nFilak cites his global perspective as a game-changer, but we aren\u2019t convinced his two years in Thailand make the difference in this race.\nThey support President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievements, Obamacare and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reforms.\nThey both urge a higher minimum wage, oppose cuts to Social Security and believe climate change is a serious threat to Texas."}
