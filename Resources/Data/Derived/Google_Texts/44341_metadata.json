The Republican presidential candidate and former Iowa caucus favorite emphasized his working class outlook, deeply-held conservative principles, and willingness to go against his own party if it means championing conservatism, Thursday afternoon at a campaign stop in Sunapee, New Hampshire.\n\nA crowd of around 100 gathered at the One Mile West Restaurant and Bar to hear the Wisconsin governor speak.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not intimidated from anything. I\u2019m not intimidated from the big government union bosses. I\u2019m not intimidated from the liberal special interests from Washington. I\u2019m not intimidated by the establishment in my own party,\u201d an energized Walker told the mostly older crowd.\n\n\u201cNow more than ever, we need leaders that are willing to stand up and not be intimidated by anybody,\u201d he said.\n\nBogged down by the surging poll numbers of real estate magnate Donald Trump, Walker has been quick to emerge as a candidate willing to go unscripted and shoot from the hip in audience interactions and grassroots engagement with voters.\n\n\u201cFor us it\u2019s simple. Grow the economy, repeal Obamacare, reign in the federal regulations that are like a wet blanket on the nation\u2019s economy, put in place an all-of-the-above energy policy \u2013 you know we\u2019re finally an energy-rich country we can use it to fuel our nation\u2019s recovery \u2013 and help people get the education and skills that they need to succeed in careers that pay far, far more than the minimum wage and then lower the tax burden,\u201d he added.\n\nAmerica doesn\u2019t need to be the \u201cworld\u2019s policeman,\u201d but it does need to stand up for itself and allies like Israel Walker said, also adding that the recent Iran deal leads down a very dangerous path, as do concessionary policies with countries such as Russia and China.\n\nAmerica Needs To Start Acting Like It\u2019s Great Again \u201cAmerica is a great country. We need to just start acting like it again,\u201d he said.\n\nAttendees applauded and cheered as he talked about he and his wife Tonette\u2019s decision to get involved in politics for the good of their children.\n\n\u201cWe had over 100,000 protesters come into our state. We had all sorts of threats, death threats \u2013 threats against my family. Eventually the recall election. And then last year, another election where I was the number one target in America. If it had just been about the title or the position I would have probably checked out. I would\u2019ve said \u2018forget it,\u2019\u201d Walker told the crowd, standing near a sign advertising steaks and dinner specials at the charming rustic restaurant.\n\n\u201cBecause of Matt and Alex and their generation, we hung in there and I\u2019m proud to tell you that today we\u2019re much better off because of it.\u201d \u201cBut because of Matt and Alex, and their generation, we hung in there, and I\u2019m proud to tell you that today we\u2019re much better off because of it. They\u2019re growing up in a state that\u2019s even better than the one we grew up in.\u201d\n\nWalker got his biggest applause lines on a promise to repeal Obamacare, stand up for American workers and be a tough negotiator in the foreign arena with a Reagan-like approach to national security.\n\n\u201cUnder President Reagan, we rebuilt the military, we stood up for our allies, we stood up against our enemies and without apologies we stood for strong American values and that brought about one of the most peaceful times in modern American history,\u201d Walker said.\n\nSome of today\u2019s conservatives, by contrast, are lacking in backbone, Walker said, painting a picture in which \u201cthe Obama/Clinton doctrine\u201d of leading from behind is dragging America through the mud, including any conservatives weak-kneed enough to go along with it.\n\n\u201cThat has us headed towards a disaster,\u201d Walker said.\n\nThe temerity he perceives from some on the right and from the left typifies his experience in Wisconsin as well, Walker said.\n\n\u201cIf we just nibble around the edges we have every right to be thrown out. I said it is \u2018put up or shut up time,\u2019\u201d Walker said of governing Wisconsin where he defeated Democrat Tom Barrett in the 2012 recall election and Democrat Mary Burke in 2014 despite the large protests against his policies limiting collective bargaining rights.\n\n\u201cI look at this country and look at the things we need to do to reform government, and take power out of Washington, and send it back to the states and back to the people,\u201d said Walker, who is also the first American governor to survive a recall election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a plan I just announced this week not only to repeal Obamacare but to light a fire under the Congress,\u201d Walker said of a planned executive order that would incentivize Congress to act swiftly.\n\nAfterwards, Walker said his message pumps up voters because it\u2019s about doing the conservative thing even if it means going against the party grain.\n\nHe\u2019s Willing To Fight, And Win \u201cPeople get excited when I talk about how we\u2019ve taken on not just the big government liberal special interests in Washington who came out against us in the recall and the protest, but how we took on our own party, took on the establishment in our party who was reluctant to go big and go bold,\u201d Walker said afterwards in a press conference, adding his enthusiasm about his own plans to make healthcare more affordable for Americans.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to fight and win for the American people whether it means taking on the opposing party or special interests in Washington or even the leadership of my own party to make sure we get the job done.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a message that resonates with supporters like Kristin Small from Claremont, New Hampshire, who attended Walker\u2019s remarks in Sunapee and is impressed with him.\n\nThough her number one presidential choice is Ted Cruz, Small said Walker appeals to her on various levels because of his conservative values and tough approach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to fight and win for the American people, whether it means taking on the opposing party or special interests in Washington or even the leadership of my own party.\u201d It\u2019s also a big draw for Walker campaign volunteer Chris Ajer from Amherst, New Hampshire, who is taking three weeks off from his management position in aerospace engineering to campaign for Walker.\n\n\u201cI think this is great,\u201d he said \u201cIt\u2019s a small venue and it\u2019s away from the dense population centers and a lot of people in New Hampshire live out in the towns, small towns and I think it\u2019s important that the governor and any of the candidates show attention not just to the urban populated centers but to all the different demographics in the state,\u201d said Ajer who added he considers himself a \u201cstaunch conservative across the board.\u201d\n\nAjer said he has supported Walker for \u201cabout a month\u201d since meeting him in person at a multi-candidate dinner at the Belknap County Republican Committee.\n\n\u201cI met him, talked to him for awhile, my wife and I, and after that we came back,\u201d Ajer said, adding that he also likes Ted Cruz, Ben Carson, and Chris Christie in the Republican field.\n\n\u201cI like him, he\u2019s tough, he gets the job done, competent, and I want a governor,\u201d Ajer said noting Walker\u2019s executive experience as governor means a great deal to him.\n\nTrump\u2019s attacks blaming him for Wisconsin\u2019s debt are not only false, they\u2019re old hat Democratic talking points, Walker said in response to a question from The Federalist.\n\n\u201cThose are the same talking points the Democrats have used in the past and they haven\u2019t worked,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI won three times in four years and Wisconsin had a $3.6 billion budget deficit. We fixed it and we cut taxes by $2 billion, the bonding levels were the lowest in 20 years. The rainy day fund is 165 times bigger than when we took office. Wisconsin is one of only two states in the country that has a fully-funded pension system. So the facts are pretty clear: Wisconsin\u2019s better off. Those are things the Democrats have said about me in the past which are not accurate which is why I\u2019ve won three elections in four years.\u201d\n\nWalker: The Optimist Earlier in his remarks to supporters, Walker also took an implied tack against Trump, painting himself as an optimist who sees the problems but doesn\u2019t only focus on them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an optimist. As angry as people are today I believe that if it was just about anger people would\u2019ve checked out given up. I don\u2019t believe people have given up on America. I\u2019ve certainly not given up on this great country. I hope you\u2019re not either. With your help, together, we can make this country great again,\u201d Walker said, perhaps unintentionally echoing Trump\u2019s campaign slogan.\n\nAs for fellow contender Jeb Bush\u2019s comments earlier Thursday that Cruz and Marco Rubio benefited from birthright citizenship, Walker said, \u201cyou\u2019ll have to ask Governor Bush that.\u201d But emphasized his desire to secure the border first and then deal with questions of immigration without amnesty, and with a legal immigration system that prioritizes American workers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m an optimist\u2026I don\u2019t believe people have given up on America.\u201d Slipping polls in his home state also doesn\u2019t bother him Walker said, adding he still has a \u201csignificant lead.\u201d\n\nHis campaign stop was not without detractors present as well, though.\n\nOne woman heckled Walker during his meet and greet about his approval of a new Milwaukee Bucks arena, coupling it with claims he doesn\u2019t adequately support higher education. The woman was coaching a young girl what to say and then took over directly, shouting questions and accusations at Walker about the details of the stadium and its donors.\n\nWisconsin teen Annalisa Kennedy, who was on vacation with her grandparents in the area, attended Walker\u2019s remarks and later appeared outside with a sign reading \u2018Walker for President.\u2019 She flipped the sign over as Walker left in an SUV so it read \u2018Walker is John Doe.\u2019 The John Doe probe found Walker\u2019s campaign free of wrongdoing and was over in July, so it was unclear why it was still regarded as fresh news by the young lady and her grandmother who had asked a question of Walker earlier about renewable energy.\n\nThat is until their political leanings were declared.\n\nKennedy shouted \u201cfeel the Bern!\u201d and \u201csolidarity!\u201d as Walker left.", "article_metadata": {"item-publish-date": "Fri, 21 Aug 2015 07:00:39 EDT", "og": {"site_name": "The Federalist", "description": "Some of today\u2019s conservatives, by contrast, are lacking in backbone, Gov.
