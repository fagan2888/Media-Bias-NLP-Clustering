If an indictment is coming, it will be soon.\n\nDuring an interview Monday night with Fox News anchor Bret Baier, Attorney General Loretta Lynch would not confirm whether a Grand Jury has been assembled to look at the evidence surrounding Hillary Clinton's use of a private server to store and transmit classified information, but she did reveal Clinton's case is being treated equally under the law. Lynch assured Baier Clinton isn't being given special treatment due to her political status or last name.\n\n\"We don't comment on specifics, what I will say as I said to the Congressmen, is that this is a matter that is being handled like any other review that we do into how any agency has handled classified information. It's being handled by career, independent lawyers here at the Department and they will review the facts and the evidence and make a determination in due course,\" Lynch said. \"There is no double standard in this [Clinton's case] or any other matter being handled by the Department of Justice.\"\n\nWatch the interview below. The portion about Clinton's criminal investigation starts around the 7 minute mark.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Being treated like everyone else. .05/27/2016 8:02:48AM EST.", "author": "Katie Pavlich", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/widetile.png", "twitter": {"description": "Being treated like everyone else.", "title": "Loretta Lynch: Hillary Clinton Isn't Getting Special Treatment as FBI Continues Investigation", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/03/01/loretta-lynch-hillarys-case-is-being-reviewed-just-like-every-other-case-we-consider-n2127055", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/20/43a90de8-ce5e-4817-82a8-02ba3a159778.jpg", "site": "@townhallcom", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-square70x70logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/smalltile.png", "robots": "index, follow", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/largetile.png", "og": {"site_name": "Townhall", "description": "Being treated like everyone else.", "title": "Loretta Lynch: Hillary Clinton Isn't Getting Special Treatment as FBI Continues Investigation", "url": "http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2016/03/01/loretta-lynch-hillarys-case-is-being-reviewed-just-like-every-other-case-we-consider-n2127055", "image": "http://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/ha/2016/20/43a90de8-ce5e-4817-82a8-02ba3a159778.jpg", "type": "Article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 143685698988231, "pages": 41632789656}, "keywords": "Attorney General Lynch: Hillary Clinton Isn't Getting Special Treatment as FBI Continues Investigation, Katie Pavlich, Conservative News, Conservative opinion, Political, Latest news, Politics, GOP, Republican, Human Events, Newsmax, Breaking news, Conservative Commentary, Articles, Columns, Conservatism, Party, Townhall, Right Wing", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "http://media.townhall.com/thm/favicon/mediumtile.png"}, "article_summary": "Lynch assured Baier Clinton isn't being given special treatment due to her political status or last name.\nThe FBI has been investigating Hillary Clinton over the use of a private email server and potential corruption between the State Department and the Clinton Foundation for more than a year.\n\"There is no double standard in this [Clinton's case] or any other matter being handled by the Department of Justice.\"\nThe portion about Clinton's criminal investigation starts around the 7 minute mark.\nIt's being handled by career, independent lawyers here at the Department and they will review the facts and the evidence and make a determination in due course,\" Lynch said."}
