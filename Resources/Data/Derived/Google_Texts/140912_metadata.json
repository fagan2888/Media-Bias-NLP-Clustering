He criticized the administration for trying to gloss over a looming crisis in the disability insurance trust fund instead of seeking a more permanent solution to protect millions of disabled Americans from the threat of sharp benefit reductions.\n\nRelated: Obama Juggles the Numbers to Save Social Security Disability Benefits\n\n\u201cHis effort to paper over the problem is a classic example of Washington ducking a real American need,\u201d Enzi said. \u201cIn this case, disabled Americans and workers deserve a long-term solution so the program doesn\u2019t once again flirt with disaster and, more importantly, reflects the full ability of the disabled to contribute their talents to our country.\u201d\n\nWith more Americans turning to the program \u2013 and increasing evidence of billions of dollars in fraud \u2013 the latest Social Security trustees\u2019 report projects the fund\u2019s reserves will be depleted in late 2016. By law, Social Security can only pay benefits if there is a positive balance in the appropriate revenues in two funds, for old age and survivors\u2019 benefits (OASI), and for disability benefits (SSDI).\n\nWithout those reserves, the only funds the government can use to cover disability claims is incoming tax revenue. Yet there would only be enough to cover 81 percent of scheduled disability benefits.\n\nActing Social Security Commissioner Carolyn Colvin defended the Obama proposal in testimony, saying the plan would shift the $330 billion from retirement accounts over the next five years. The shift would stave off an estimated 19 percent cut in future benefits should the program become insolvent late next year.\n\nRelated: The Government Entitlement Program That\u2019s About to Dry Up\n\n\u201cThe proposal to reallocate existing payroll tax collections between the OASI and DI trust funds is consistent with past congressional actions,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are earned benefits, and these two funds provide social insurance for Americans at all stages of life.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWe must take steps to insure its stability, and avoid deep and abrupt cuts or cessation of benefits for individuals with disabilities.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), the ranking member of the Budget Committee, stressed that shifting money between the two Social Security accounts has been done successfully 11 times before, dating back to the Johnson administration in 1968. Those moves, though, have usually been accompanied by actions to strengthen the program\u2019s finances.\n\nHouse Republicans recently passed a rule that would require any shift of funds to the disability program to be paired with reforms designed to bolster the program. Democrats and the administration opposed that rule change.\n\nRelated: The New Senate Budget Chief Is a GOP Dealmaker\n\nSanders, a liberal who is considering challenging former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, charged that Republicans were trying to precipitate a crisis to force cuts to the benefits of the 11 million people currently claiming disability benefits \u2013 an accusation Enzi and other Republicans dispute.\n\n\u201cIn my view, the debate we are having today is nothing more than a manufactured crisis, which is part of the long-term Republican agenda of trying to cut Social Security,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nBut Enzi and other Republicans received some support from Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with the Democrats. King, a former governor, said a reallocation of funding would simply avoid dealing with the finances of Social Security, which need to be beefed up as more baby boomers retire.\n\n\u201cThis is just a way of making this problem worse when it does come,\u201d King said. \u201cProblems put off rarely get easier with the passage of time.\u201d\n\nThe key provision of the Obama plan would shore up the SSDI Trust Fund with the substantial income transfer. Currently, employers and their workers each pay a total of 6.2 percent of their wages to the Social Security system \u2013 0.9 percent is allocated to SSDI and 5.3 percent to OASI. Under Obama\u2019s approach, neither the overall tax rate nor the solvency of the combined trust funds would be affected.\n\nInstead, the plan would reallocate a few tenths of a percentage point of payroll tax revenue from the OASI fund to the SSDI fund, so that both trust funds would be sustained until 2033.\n\nThe plan also calls for testing early intervention strategies to keep people in the workplace, hiring more administrative law judges to reduce a backlog of appeals of adverse rulings, and bolstering a program that reviews cases every three to seven years to determine if a beneficiary\u2019s medical condition has improved.\n\nThe AARP and most other groups that advocate for older Americans are actively promoting the Obama plan and opposing the recent House-passed rule.\n\nRelated: To Beat the Coming Disability Insurance Disaster, Stay Healthy\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, said yesterday that the House rule only requires small changes in either the OASI or DI programs, similar to laws recently passed or proposed.\n\n\u201cAlthough the best way to deal with DI\u2019s imbalance would be through comprehensive Social Security reform that restores long-term solvency for both funds \u2013 as the 1977 and 1983 reforms did while reallocating revenue as part of comprehensive reforms \u2013 the new rule requires much less than that,\u201d the group said in a blog post. \u201cIt does not even require savings equal to the amount of reallocation. It simply requires that reallocation be accompanied by changes of any size to improve solvency of the combined OASDI Fund, which is consistent with past actions on reallocation.\u201d\n\nCongress is running out of time to address this latest financial crisis. Legislation will be required during this session of Congress or, at the very latest, in a rush of activity early next year to prevent large sudden benefit cuts.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "President Obama\u2019s plan to shift $330 billion in Social Security retirement funds aroun", "title": "Social Security Disability Funding Fix Hits Brick Wall", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/12/Social-Security-Disability-Funding-Fix-Hits-Brick-Wall", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/02262013_Deficit_Disability_slideshow.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/02/12/Social-Security-Disability-Funding-Fix-Hits-Brick-Wall", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/slideshows/02262013_Deficit_Disability_slideshow.jpg", "creator": "@ericpianin", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "President Obama\u2019s plan to shift $330 billion in Social Security retirement funds aroun", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Related: Obama Juggles the Numbers to Save Social Security Disability Benefits\u201cHis effort to paper over the problem is a classic example of Washington ducking a real American need,\u201d Enzi said.\nKing, a former governor, said a reallocation of funding would simply avoid dealing with the finances of Social Security, which need to be beefed up as more baby boomers retire.\nYet there would only be enough to cover 81 percent of scheduled disability benefits.\nBy law, Social Security can only pay benefits if there is a positive balance in the appropriate revenues in two funds, for old age and survivors\u2019 benefits (OASI), and for disability benefits (SSDI).\nUnder Obama\u2019s approach, neither the overall tax rate nor the solvency of the combined trust funds would be affected."}
