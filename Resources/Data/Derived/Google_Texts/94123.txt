SUSAN TAFFE REED

Native American Studies head at Dartmouth leaves post but not the school



— Dartmouth College's recently appointed Native American Studies director, who has been accused of cultural appropriation by Native America advocates, has left the position, but not necessarily the college.

..

“Susan Taffe Reed will no longer serve as the director of the Native American Program. Unfortunately, the distraction around her appointment prevents her from effectively serving in this role. It does not prevent her from contributing to Dartmouth in other ways, and we are currently exploring opportunities with her,” Dartmouth spokeswoman Diana Lawrence said in a statement this week. “The experience of Dartmouth students is our priority and we are working to ensure that we have a strong and easily accessible network of support in place for our students. We have identified a highly qualified interim Native American Program advisor.”

Taffe Reed stepped in as the new director of Dartmouth's Native American Program on Sept. 1, Dartmouth said in a press release on Sept. 11.



Taffe Reed is an ethnomusicologist and the president of the Eastern Delaware Nations, the college said.

..

The appointment had drawn criticism from some in the Native American community who said Taffe Reed was of European descent and that the Eastern Delaware Nations is not federally recognized.



On the Facebook page — Native American Alumni at Dartmouth — Bear Christensen wrote, “Dartmouth is extremely tone-deaf during a time where cultural appropriation is a hot-button issue, (Rachel Dozeal, etc.)”

In response, Dartmouth officials said that she is of mixed descent, including Native American, and that not all tribes are federally recognized.



“Susan openly acknowledged that she is a person of mixed ancestry and identity, including Native ancestry. In the case of Native peoples (and other people of color), state records, including birth and death certificates, are notoriously unreliable sources of information about personal background. Likewise, there are serious problems with reliance on notions of “federal recognition” as a measure of “authenticity” since the standards for such recognition have been widely and consistently criticized by Native and non-Native scholars and activists alike ever since they were promulgated in 1978,” Dartmouth Native American Studies professor Bruce Duthu said in a statement after the controversial arose last month.

In a letter to the college last week, the board of directors of the Native American Alumni Association of Dartmouth College expressed concern.



“While the selection committee for this position included members of the administration, faculty from the Native American Studies Department, a member of the Native American Visiting Council and Native American students, the NAAAD Board was not invited to participate in the process. The NAAAD Board recognizes the challenges that the Native American community faces with identity and cultural appropriation and respects the College's past efforts to address its role in such dialogue — one example being the removal of the Indian mascot in 1969. However, the College must be more cognizant of issues related to identity and cultural appropriation when it makes hiring decisions. Though the NAAAD Board does not assert that the NAP Director must be a member or citizen of a federal or state recognized tribe, it holds firm that the NAP Director must be able to empathize and relate to students and their needs, to navigate the political and organizational culture of Dartmouth, and to properly represent the students and the College amongst other peer institutions and tribal nations. Unfortunately, Dr. Taffe Reed's hiring, coupled with the negative media such hiring has garnered, has caused an irreparable division amongst alumni, and more importantly, the students, thereby making it impossible for her to perform these essential functions. From our communications with students, alumni, faculty, and tribal leaders, it has become clear to the NAAAD Board that Dr. Taffe Reed cannot effectively carry out her duties as the Director of the NAP. Therefore, the College should take steps to find a replacement.”

Lawrence said in an email Friday, “It was the decision of Dartmouth that she leave the position. She is still employed by the College.”
