Further, the law states that hiring foreign workers cannot \u201cadversely affect the wages and working conditions\u201d of Americans.\n\nMalkin and co-author John Miano, a fellow with CIS, dug into H-1B\u2019s complexities and found that claims from tech companies arguing there is a \u201cshortage\u201d of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) workers in the U.S. is false.\n\nInstead, Miano said the opposite is true. He cited a CIS study based on 2012 census data that found that only a third of Americans who graduated with STEM degrees work in a related field.\n\nA primary reason for this, he continued, is that Congress codified the ability of tech firms to pay foreign workers roughly $20,000 less per year than their American counterparts through updates to its H-1B program.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t by accident,\u201d Miano said. \u201cReplacing Americans with foreign workers is a deliberate part of the H-1B program[.] \u2026 So when you hear these complaints from Congress that we need to do something, it\u2019s Congress that needs to do something and stop being beholden to the industry lobbyists.\u201d\n\nThe federal government caps the number of visas at 85,000 per year, resulting in about 650,000 H-1B foreign workers in the country today, Malkin noted.\n\nThe New York Times has noted in multiple articles that the H-1B program has shifted from its original intent.\n\n\u201cGlobal outsourcing and consulting firms have obtained thousands of temporary visas to bring in foreign workers who have taken over jobs that had been held by American workers,\u201d Times reporter Julia Preston wrote in September.\n\nTo restore the program\u2019s original purpose, Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Dick Durbin of Illinois introduced legislation earlier this week that would require employers seeking to hire foreign workers through the H-1B program to first make a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d to recruit American workers.\n\n\u201cThe H-1B visa program was never meant to replace qualified American workers, but it was instead intended as a means to fill gaps in highly specialized areas of employment that cannot be filled by Americans,\u201d Grassley said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a sense of urgency here for Americans who are losing their jobs to lesser skilled workers who are coming in at lower wages on a visa program that has gotten away from its original intent.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Each year American tech workers are forced by companies to train lower-wage and often less-skilled foreign workers to replace them, said Michelle Malkin.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Each year American tech workers are forced by companies to train lower-wage and often less-skilled foreign workers to replace them, said Michelle Malkin.", "title": "How a US Visa Program Is Displacing America\u2019s Tech Workers", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151112_MalkinVisas_Johnson.jpg", "updated_time": "2015-11-16T09:13:26+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1kueiru"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "Each year American tech workers are forced by companies to train lower-wage and often less-skilled foreign workers to replace them, said Michelle Malkin.", "title": "How a US Visa Program Is Displacing America\u2019s Tech Workers", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/151112_MalkinVisas_Johnson.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Society", "tag": "immigration", "published_time": "2015-11-13T16:52:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-16T09:13:26+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "H-1B, immigration, Michelle Malkin, Sold Out, Center for Immigration Studies, Chuck Grassley"}, "article_summary": "The H-1B visa program was initially created to allow companies to hire temporary foreign workers with college degrees and \u201chighly specialized knowledge\u201d if no one in the U.S. is qualified for the position.\n\u201cReplacing Americans with foreign workers is a deliberate part of the H-1B program[.]\nEach year, American tech workers are laid off in masses across the United States, successively forced by their companies to train lower-wage and often less-skilled foreign workers to replace them, conservative columnist Michelle Malkin said Thursday.\n\u201cGlobal outsourcing and consulting firms have obtained thousands of temporary visas to bring in foreign workers who have taken over jobs that had been held by American workers,\u201d Times reporter Julia Preston wrote in September.\nThe New York Times has noted in multiple articles that the H-1B program has shifted from its original intent."}
