Based on our extensive experience partnering with institutions like this, we\u2019ve outlined six key challenges that we see for credit unions and their in-house professionals in today\u2019s environment. We know the value that a credit union offers to its members, and we leverage our expertise to assist these clients in achieving success.\n\nMember Retention + Engagement with Incentives and Promotions\n\nCredit unions operate in a fiercely competitive market and member retention and engagement are crucial elements for their long-term viability.

And given today\u2019s low interest rate, some borrower members may have become overextended on projects. When the Federal Treasury interest rate increases, it is likely that these borrowers will encounter financial fatigue. Finding unique solutions and workouts is critical in addressing this issue.\n\nAppropriate Loan Structuring to Fit Individualized Needs\n\nCredit unions offer individualized products to demonstrate value to their members. A fully integrated legal services partner should take the time to understand all the players in each transaction to ensure the best outcomes for their clients. In-house professionals should seek a law firm with experience in risk assessment and mitigation for real property lending, construction loans, asset-based lending, floor plan financing, and other forms of collateral.\n\nMergers + Acquisitions among Credit Unions\n\nIncreasingly, credit unions are examining possibilities for streamlining operations and taking advantage of economies of scale achieved through partnerships and merger transactions. Our role focuses on guiding clients through the analysis of whether a merger or acquisition is actually the right path and, if so, the mechanics of merging with or acquiring another credit union while minimizing disruption in your daily business operations.\n\nRegulatory Compliance with the Affordable Care Act and other Developments\n\nRecent developments through the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act have led to avoidable missteps in compliance. Because these regulations can be highly complex, it is advisable to consult with legal professionals dedicated to understanding these acts comprehensively. A compliance audit can be all that is needed to help insulate credit unions from falling out of line with federal, state and local requirements.\n\nCreative Solutions for Loss Mitigation + Workouts\n\nThough the economy has certainly improved since the economic downturn, non-performing loans are still weighing heavily on the books of many credit unions. Potential solutions might include restructuring, auctions, receivership, asset surrender, or other remedies, but each circumstance is unique in its relationship and financial dynamics. Creativity and a strict focus on your company\u2019s level of risk tolerance should be the focus of your legal services partner.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=6a07038b-a5a8-429c-847f-47a153407777", "image": "http://www.lexology.com/images/share/lexology-facebook.png", "description": "Credit unions operate in a fiercely competitive market and member retention and engagement are crucial elements for their long-term viability.
