It left the Rockies wishing for a third chance.\n\nHunter Pence\u2019s eighth-inning double finally, without mercy, gave the Giants a 4-2 victory over the Rockies. Official game time: Three hours, 16 minutes.\n\n\u201cOnce the game started, it was business as usual,\u201d Rockies manager Walt Weiss said.\n\nBut the Rockies\u2019 loss closed a time bridge that, over three-plus months, sent their season into shambles.\n\nIf the May game came in like a lion for the Rockies, it went out like a kitten in September. The Rockies on that day were 26-21, just three games behind division-leading San Francisco in the National League West. Colorado had the fourth-best record in the NL overall.\n\n\u201cI felt like we had the upper hand when that game started,\u201d Weiss said. \u201cWe got out to a lead and Jorge (De La Rosa) had to come out of the game because of the rain.\n\n\u201cWe had 10 hits at that point in the game. It looked like we were on our way.\u201d\n\nSince then, the Rockies are 28-62 (a paltry .311 winning percentage). They dropped 11 spots into the cellar. At 54-83 overall, they now have the worst record in the NL.\n\nThe resumed game will go into the books with an odd boxscore. Michael Cuddyer went 3-for-4 with a second-inning RBI after he singled home Wilin Rosario. And Troy Tulowitzki went 1-for-2 with a walk.\n\nBut when Part II started, Cuddyer was on the 15-day disabled list with a hamstring strain. And Tulowitkzi\u2019s season was long over \u2014 he\u2019s on the 60-day disabled list after surgery on torn cartilage in his hip.\n\nThat left the Rockies to cobble together a lineup of replacements. They included players who, by September, have become regulars \u2014 Josh Rutledge at shortstop for Tulowitzki and Charlie Culberson, who pinch-ran for Cuddyer.\n\nFor the Giants, their May stars carried over to September with barely a missed step.\n\nPence, who in May\u2019s fourth inning homered off Rockies reliever Tommy Kahnle (he\u2019s now also on the DL), came through again in September\u2019s eighth. His line-drive double to right field scored catcher Andrew Susac. Pence then scored on Travis Ishikawa\u2019s soft single to right for a two-run lead.\n\n\u201cPence is a clutch hitter. He\u2019s a good hitter,\u201d Weiss said.\n\nJorge De La Rosa, who pitched a scoreless first three innings in May, will get a no-decision on his record.\n\nChristian Friedrich \u2014 who was pitching as a starter for the Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox in May but was recently called-up as a Rockies reliever \u2014 earned the loss after allowing the winning run eighth.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke\n\nLooking ahead\n\nGiants\u2019 Yusmeiro Petit (4-3, 3.44 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Jordan Lyles (6-2, 4.08), 6:40 p.m. Tuesday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nLyles will make his second consecutive start against the Giants. He pitched six innings in a 4-1 loss at San Francisco last week. It was his first loss since May 17 \u2014 a span that included a two-month stint on the disabled list because of a broken hand. Lyles had five strikeouts and gave up only four hits against the Giants last week at AT&T Park, but he issued three walks in the sixth inning.
