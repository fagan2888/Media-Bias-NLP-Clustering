SUN\n\nWhen Ted Goff was hospitalized late last year, barely breathing and with advanced emphysema, his doctor said the prognosis was bad.\n\nThey talked about Goff\u2019s last wishes and whether he wanted to be placed on a breathing machine. Goff wasn\u2019t sure.\n\nSo his doctor suggested he watch a video explaining this technique and other options for end-of-life care.\n\nThe video was direct and dramatic. In a demonstration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, a technician pushed down hard on the chest of a dummy. A white-coated doctor laid out grim odds: \u201cMost of the time, in patients with advanced disease, CPR does not work,\u201d she said. As a result, patients need a ventilator to help them continue breathing.\n\nGoff watched a technician maneuver a metal instrument down the dummy\u2019s throat to prepare for insertion of a tube that pushes air into the lungs. Then the camera zoomed to a close-up of an elderly patient, eyes closed, in a hospital bed. He had a breathing tube in his mouth.\n\n\u201cYou cannot eat or talk while on this machine,\u201d the doctor on the video said.\n\nThat made up Ted Goff\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201c \u2018I ain\u2019t gonna do that,\u2019 \u201d his wife, Linda, recalled the retired businessman saying. \u201cPutting him on a ventilator, opening an airway, pounding on your chest \u2026 . No, he didn\u2019t like any of that. \u2026 It\u2019s just not something he wanted to experience,\u201d she said.\n\nGoff wanted only to be kept comfortable until the end came.\n\nRare is the person who is willing to grapple openly with death. Health-care providers often don\u2019t talk to patients about their preferences. And patients and their families often don\u2019t know their options and avoid asking about them.\n\nFor patients approaching the end of life, that can mean not knowing about palliative-care alternatives, which research has shown can significantly improve patient satisfaction and quality of life. Instead, they continue to get aggressive treatment.\n\nClinicians and others trying to improve end-of-life communication between doctors and their patient have turned for help to a set of videos such as the one that Goff saw. Developed by two Harvard doctors, the videos aim to better inform patients about their medical options while easing the way for frank discussions.\n\nIn clinical trials, researchers found that dying patients were less likely to want aggressive end-of-life care if they had watched the videos than if they had simply been told about the procedures.\n\nThe videos are not intended to be a substitute for talking with doctors and other providers. And they need to be used in the appropriate context.\n\n\u201cNot every tool is good for everyone,\u201d said Valerie Sirani, a palliative-care nurse who has used the videos with some of her patients at Kaiser Permanente\u2019s skilled nursing facilities in suburban Maryland. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to exacerbate anticipated grief.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2014/06/hfaging24.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdb0fa\"", "article_summary": "So his doctor suggested he watch a video explaining this technique and other options for end-of-life care.\nGoff wanted only to be kept comfortable until the end came.\nClinicians and others trying to improve end-of-life communication between doctors and their patient have turned for help to a set of videos such as the one that Goff saw.\nDeveloped by two Harvard doctors, the videos aim to better inform patients about their medical options while easing the way for frank discussions.\nIn clinical trials, researchers found that dying patients were less likely to want aggressive end-of-life care if they had watched the videos than if they had simply been told about the procedures."}
