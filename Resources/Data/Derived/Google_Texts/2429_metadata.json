But when Richardson learned that he could be part of an HIV prevention pill research study for young people, he was skeptical.\n\n\u201cI was scared. I had to really think about it, \u2018What is this drug going to do to me?\u2019 \u201d he says.\n\nThe regimen, called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, can reduce the risk of HIV infection by more than 85 percent when a pill called Truvada is taken daily. In a first, the Food and Drug Administration approved Truvada for prevention of the infection in 2012. Truvada had been used previously to treat HIV infection.\n\nBut the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends caution when prescribing PrEP to adolescents. CDC is waiting for final results from the trials being conducted on young people in cities across the country.\n\nInitially, Richardson\u2019s mom stoked his concerns. \u201cShe was saying the medical industry tried to sterilize some people; they were trying to do it again,\u201d he remembers. But he found encouragement from another family member: his grandfather, who is HIV-positive.\n\n\u201cWe had a long discussion about this drug and what the side effects could be, and he overall supported me totally,\u201d Richardson says. \u201cAnd it was kinda like, why not? Let me just try it.\u201d\n\nNow, Richardson is part of CRUSH, an HIV-prevention project in Oakland. CRUSH offers PrEP to participants.\n\nDaniel Zeh is part of a PrEP study being conducted by the Adolescent Trials Network with young people between the ages of 15 and 22, based at John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital in Chicago. He was 17 when he started taking the pill as part of a daily regimen that was sometimes hard to explain, he says.\n\n\u201cI guess it was kind of weird during high school, popping it before lunch, trying to make sure nobody sees,\u201d Zeh chuckles. \u201cPeople are like, \u2018What are you taking?\u2019 \u2018Nothing, you know, just a sugar pill.\u2019 \u201d\n\nZeh first heard about the Stroger Hospital study on Facebook. Outreach coordinators also turned to gay hook-up apps, like Grindr and Jack\u2019d, to recruit possible subjects. It\u2019s a clever strategy, even if it\u2019s awkward to run into a researcher when you\u2019re looking for a date.\n\nPsychologist Sybil Hosek, the lead researcher for the study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, offered to pay participants $50 per visit to the clinic. When enough guys said yes, she got to work.\n\n\u201cWhat we wanted to do was design a study where they could try to take this pill every day,\u201d Hosek explains. \u201cAnd see whether, one, they were interested in taking it; two, if it was hard for them to take it; and three, how it impacted their sexual behavior.\u201d For instance, would being on the pill encourage more risky sexual activity?\n\nInside a conference room at the hospital, a group of the guys in the study share stories about what it\u2019s like to be on PrEP. Dexter Canty is also enrolled in the Chicago PrEP study, and says people have a lot of misunderstandings about the pill and individuals who take it. They\u2019re often asked, \u201cAre you HIV positive?\u201d But, in fact, they\u2019re taking the drug to prevent getting infected.\n\nCanty compares the reactions he\u2019s experienced to people\u2019s perceptions when he goes to the drugstore to buy condoms or when a woman goes to Planned Parenthood and gets birth control. \u201cYou\u2019re automatically looked at as being promiscuous instead of safe,\u201d he says.\n\nThe idea is that PrEP would be used in combination with condoms. But critics worry that the pill will make users feel invincible, increasing the likelihood that they won\u2019t use condoms or follow through on taking the pill every day. And when you miss doses, the pill becomes less effective.\n\nAndrew Weinstein, president of the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation, is against PrEP use, especially by young people. \u201cYoung people have unstable lives. They\u2019re sleeping on someone\u2019s couch. They\u2019re out for the weekend,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s not to stigmatize them, it\u2019s just the nature of youth. It\u2019s a carefree time. Expecting people to take a pill every day is not realistic,\u201d says Weinstein.\n\nIt\u2019s enticing to imagine a magic pill that could bring about the end of AIDS. But a recent study of young adults taking PrEP shows that they take it, at best, 60 percent of the time.\n\nThis story was produced by outLoud, a project of Youth Radio.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Oakland program is part of national study looking at Truvada to protect at-risk teens.", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Will the HIV-Prevention Pill Protect Teens or Encourage Risky Behavior?\",\"url\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/2015\\/03\\/13\\/will-the-hiv-prevention-pill-protect-teens-or-encourage-risky-behavior\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2015-03-13 09:58:08\",\"mod_date\":\"2015-03-17 11:18:58\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":24448,\"author_id\":\"8344\",\"author_name\":\"State of Health\",\"author_display_name\":\"State of Health\",\"tags\":[\"HIV\",\"Science\",\"Truvada\"],\"categories\":[\"Community Health\",\"Tests &amp; Treatments\"],\"image\":\"http:\\/\\/ww2.kqed.org\\/stateofhealth\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/sites\\/27\\/2012\\/07\\/TruvadaBottle_05102012_JustinSullivan_GettyImages-e1426265162534.jpg\"}", "og": {"site_name": "State of Health", "description": "Oakland program is part of national study looking at Truvada to protect at-risk teens.", "title": "Will the HIV-Prevention Pill Protect Teens or Encourage Risky Behavior?", "url": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/2015/03/13/will-the-hiv-prevention-pill-protect-teens-or-encourage-risky-behavior/", "image": "http://ww2.kqed.org/stateofhealth/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2012/07/TruvadaBottle_05102012_JustinSullivan_GettyImages-620x427.jpg", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@kqedhealth", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@"}, "fb": {"app_id": 160023622793}, "keywords": "hiv,science,truvada", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "But a recent study of young adults taking PrEP shows that they take it, at best, 60 percent of the time.\nBut when Richardson learned that he could be part of an HIV prevention pill research study for young people, he was skeptical.\nThey\u2019re often asked, \u201cAre you HIV positive?\u201d But, in fact, they\u2019re taking the drug to prevent getting infected.\nDexter Canty is also enrolled in the Chicago PrEP study, and says people have a lot of misunderstandings about the pill and individuals who take it.\n\u201cPeople are like, \u2018What are you taking?\u2019 \u2018Nothing, you know, just a sugar pill.\u2019 \u201dZeh first heard about the Stroger Hospital study on Facebook."}
