Julie Moyer of Fond du Lac is the grand prize winner of the Agnesian HealthCare Foundation’s Samaritan $100,000 cash raffle.

Her winning ticket was randomly drawn on Wednesday at Agnesian HealthCare in Fond du Lac.

This is the third year the foundation has offered the cash raffle. It replaces what was the Samaritan Health Clinic House Raffle, which was established 21 years ago to help provide vital medical and emergency dental services to individuals and families in financial need.

Nearly 5,000 tickets were sold in the raffle.

“We are so grateful for everyone’s dedication,” said Holly Brenner, Agnesian HealthCare Foundation president. Even with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act, Brenner said, there is a continued need in the community for services provided by the Samaritan Health Clinic.

More than 10,000 Fond du Lac County residents and more than 7,900 Dodge County residents are uninsured, Brenner said. As a result, charity care programs, which provide free or low-cost health care to individuals not eligible for affordable health insurance, will continue to play an important role in the healthcare system.

Other prize winners include: second prize, $15,000: Rob Rusniaczek, Fond du Lac; third prize, $10,000: Jeff Grebe, Mount Calvary; fourth prize, $5,000: Linda Marcoe, Fond du Lac; fifth prize, $4,000: Nina Sera, Slinger; sixth prize, $3,000: Laura Launders, Fond du Lac; and seventh prize, $2,000: and Kristina Thalacker, Beaver Dam.
