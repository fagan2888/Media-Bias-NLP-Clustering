People who love books are preparing for the Friday kick-off for Lit Fest 2014, the two-week celebration of literary culture created by the Lighthouse Writers Workshop of Denver.

There’s something for everyone, from workshops and craft sessions to a literary salon. Busy professionals who yearn to write best-sellers can learn more about the business of writing at lunch-hour panels that cover everything from finding an agent to new trends in publishing.

And people who just love good books can attend literary salons or schmooze at the book fair tent.

Some events are free, and include a brown-bag lunch series for young writers every day from June 9 to June 13, from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m.

Mark Doty, the National Book Award-winning poet, will read to kids on June 12.

Local writers participating in Lit Fest include Eleanor Brown, author of “The Weird Sisters,” and Mario Acevedo, author of the Felix Gomez detective-vampire series.

Visiting writers include Steve Almond (“Candyfreak”), Emily Rapp (“Poster Child: A Memoir”), and Gordy Hoffman, who teaches screenwriting at USC Graduate Film School, and who wrote the film “Love Liza,” which starred his brother, Philip Seymour Hoffman.

The kick-off party starts at 6 p.m. on Friday, June 6, with live music, food and a beer garden. 1515 Race St., Denver.
