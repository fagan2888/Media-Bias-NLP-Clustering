While these flights are ostensibly for training, they are also clearly intended to message to us,\u201d Adm. William Gortney, the commander of NORAD, told The Washington Times.\n\nRep. Michael K. Conaway, a Texas Republican who serves on the House Armed Services Committee, said he believes the Kremlin\u2019s message is crystal-clear and that it ultimately could trigger a dangerous response.\n\n\u201cOn a tactical level, this is a pattern that shows they\u2019re testing our responses to see what we\u2019re doing and how we do it,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re very provocative, they\u2019re subject to miscommunication, and some event could happen that no one wants.\n\n\u201cSo why do the Russians continue to do it? I think they\u2019re rattling sabers in a sense. I think this is definitely coming from [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. They\u2019re flexing their muscles, they\u2019re trying to reclaim the superpower status that Putin has always wanted to. It\u2019s a great concern, it\u2019s dangerous and it\u2019s provocative. There\u2019s no good that can come from it, and it needs to stop,\u201d Rep. Conaway said.\n\nA spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Washington did not respond to repeated requests seeking comment.\n\nThe Russian bombers also have entered the buffer zones around other NATO allies. In all, The Times identified from public reports at least two dozen incidents since 2012 in which a Russian bomber buzzed U.S. or other NATO airspace.\n\nSuch aerial incursions were common during the Cold War era of the Soviet Union but became almost nonexistent until 2006, when they resumed under the leadership of Mr. Putin. Navy Capt. Jeff Davis said there were on average about five such incidents per year within the American Air Defense Identification Zone, but that spiked in 2014.\n\n\u201cIt was a fairly steady clip and then last year there was a big spike, which coincided with Russia\u2019s incursion into Ukraine,\u201d Capt. Davis said in an interview. \u201cThe flights tend to be seasonal \u2014 they usually stand down in the winter, gear up in the spring and in the summer and then wind down in the fall \u2014 so we don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be this year. The jury\u2019s still out since summer just started.\u201d\n\nGen. Michael V. Hayden, a retired four-star Air Force general and former director of the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency, said the flights present a clear and present danger to the national security of the United States and threaten to damage U.S.-Russian relations.\n\n\u201cThere is something both dangerous and pathetic about these Russian actions. Dangerous, in the sense that accidents and missteps happen and these kinds of provocations can lead to unwanted confrontations. Pathetic, in the sense that they are a faint reflection of Soviet power of decades past,\u201d Mr. Hayden said.\n\n\u201cTickling NATO airspace with a \u2018Bear\u2019 bomber was tough-looking perhaps in the 1960s. Now it is simply a reminder that Putin\u2019s current tools of power \u2014 nuclear weapons, the veto at the U.N. and these bomber missions \u2014 are the detritus of a bygone era, not evidence of a resurgent Russian state,\u201d he said.\n\n(Corrected paragraph:) The Pentagon makes public only incidents in which American military aircraft intercept Russian bombers. Last year, the U.S. acknowledged several aerial incursions, including incidents off the coasts of Alaska, California, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico. In August, four Russian bombers came within 50 miles of the California coast and illegally flew directly into airspace of NATO allies Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden.\n\nIn many cases, Russia has sent \u2018Tu-95 Bear H\u2019 bombers, which are powered by four turbo-propellers and are capable of carrying nuclear cruise missiles and electronic warfare gear. The planes have a range of about 9,400 miles without refueling, but sometimes fly alongside IL-78 aerial refueling tankers.\n\nDavid Satter, a Moscow correspondent who in 2013 became the first American expelled from Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union, said the flights are extensions of the Kremlin\u2019s tactics to try to manipulate public opinion in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to affect the atmosphere and political dialogue in the United States by making people reluctant to challenge them over Ukraine, reminding us that they have nuclear weapons, that they are unpredictable and that they don\u2019t play by the rules.\u201d Mr. Satter said. \u201cThese close-range military flights are a way good way of doing that because Americans will respond by being cautious, and by not doing the maximum to resist their aggression,\u201d Mr. Satter said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The number of long-range Russian strategic bomber flights that buzzed U.S. airspace doubled last year from their norm, forcing American jets to frequently scramble and capturing the attention of hawks in Congress who believe the Kremlin is sending a veiled warning to President Obama to keep out of its affairs in Ukraine.", "author": "The Washington Times http://www.washingtontimes.com", "og": {"site_name": "The Washingtion Times", "description": "The number of long-range Russian strategic bomber flights that buzzed U.S. airspace doubled last year from their norm, forcing American jets to frequently scramble and capturing the attention of hawks in Congress who believe the Kremlin is sending a veiled warning to President Obama to keep out of its affairs in Ukraine.", "title": "Russian bomber flights buzzing U.S. airspace doubled last year", "url": "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/jun/7/russian-bomber-flights-buzzing-us-airspace-doubled/", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/07/Russia.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@washtimes", "image": "http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/image/2015/06/07/Russia.jpg", "description": "The number of long-range Russian strategic bomber flights that buzzed U.S. airspace doubled last year from their norm, forcing American jets to frequently scramble and capturing the attention of hawks", "card": "summary", "title": "Russian bomber flights buzzing U.S. airspace doubled last year"}, "Author": "Jeffrey Scott Shapiro", "bitly-verification": "d180fd45f70d", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "msvalidate.01": "5B44585918D69318CA2120B5FA20D85C", "serverf": "web1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "War Conflict, Ukraine, Russia, Putin, Michael K Conaway"}, "article_summary": "(Corrected paragraph:) The Pentagon makes public only incidents in which American military aircraft intercept Russian bombers.\nIn August, four Russian bombers came within 50 miles of the California coast and illegally flew directly into airspace of NATO allies Ireland, the Netherlands and Sweden.\nThe Russian bombers also have entered the buffer zones around other NATO allies.\nIn all, The Times identified from public reports at least two dozen incidents since 2012 in which a Russian bomber buzzed U.S. or other NATO airspace.\nJeff Davis said there were on average about five such incidents per year within the American Air Defense Identification Zone, but that spiked in 2014."}
