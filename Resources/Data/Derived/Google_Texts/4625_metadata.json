Scott Renfroe won top line on the June primary ballot over Weld County District Attorney Ken Buck in the fight to replace Comgressman Cory Gardner in Colorado\u2019s deeply conservative Fourth Congressional District.\n\nGardner, R-Yuma, decided in late February to challenge Sen. Mark Udall for his seat.\n\nRenfroe won 54 percent of the 673 votes cast by GOP delegates from across the sprawling Fourth District, which includes Weld County and all of the states eastern plains.\n\nBuck won 46 percent.\n\nBuck, who had been running for Senate but immediately switched races with Gardner, pledged to focus on reducing spending in Washington.\n\n\u201cI will support a constitutional balanced budget amendment,\u201d Buck said, eschewing the social issues Renfroe chose to emphasize in his speech.\n\nDescribing his recovery from cancer last year, Buck recognized the importance of medicine and vowed to repeal Obamacare because, he said, \u201cmedicine cannot go downhill.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a fighter,\u201d he continued. \u201cI want to take that fight to Washington, DC.\u201d\n\nRenfroe, who is supported by Rocky Mountain Gun Owners and challenging the conservative Buck from the right, emphasized his Christian values and took a thinly veiled shot at Buck on the issue of personhood, which Buck backed away from toward the end of his unsuccessful 2010 U.S. Senate campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be a strong conservative voice for you. I\u2019ll be a strong voice for liberty,\u201d Renfroe said. \u201cI\u2019m committed to protecting life and will never waver in my commitment to protecting the unborn or for personhood.\u201d\n\nAs delegates were seated, volunteers for the Colorado Christian Coalition, an RMGO spin-off, distributed fliers highlighting Renfroe\u2019s positions on social issues (Buck, the filer noted, \u201crefused to respond\u201d to the group\u2019s survey).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a career politician, I\u2019m just a small business owner,\u201d said Renfroe, who\u2019s in the last year of his eight-year run at the legislature, addressing a packed room of CD-4 delegates.\n\nWeld County Commissioner Barbara Kirkmeyer, after addressing delegates and outlining her own support for personhood, gun rights and fracking, declined to be nominated because she\u2019s also petitioning onto the primary ballot and released her delegates to vote for other candidates.\n\nBusinessman Steve Laffey, who is also petitioning onto the CD-4 ballot, did not attend Friday\u2019s assembly.", "article_metadata": {"description": "BROOMFIELD, Colo. -- State Sen.
