Though hookah is a water pipe, it still has nearly as many toxins as cigarette smoke and nicotine, the addictive drug in cigarettes.\n\nSmoking tobacco through water doesn\u2019t necessarily filter out any of these toxins that can damage the lungs and heart. \u201cThe cooled and sweetened flavor of hookah tobacco makes it more enticing to kids and they falsely believe it\u2019s less harmful,\u201d Tracey E. Barnett of the University of Florida in Gainesville told Reuters. \u201cOne-time use can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning or other diseases, including but not limited to tuberculosis, herpes, respiratory illnesses including the flu, and long-term use can lead to heart disease and many cancers.\u201d\n\nSmoking hookah, or \u201cshisha,\u201d dates back to the 15th century, where it was common among Hindus in India. The practice spread throughout the Ottoman Empire, and has recently become far more popular in Europe and the West.\n\nIn a study completed in 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) discovered that many hookah smokers believe it\u2019s less risky than cigarette smoking. \u201cHowever, hookah smoke contains many of the same harmful toxins as cigarette smoke,\u201d the CDC writes on its website, \u201cand has been associated with lung cancer, respiratory illness, low birth weight, and periodontal disease.\u201d The World Health Organization (WHO), meanwhile, states that hookah smoking sessions last much longer than a typical cigarette break. They can last from 20 to 80 minutes, with the smoker inhaling the same amount of smoke that would be produced by 100 cigarettes. A typical one-hour long hookah session involves about 200 puffs, compared to an average of 20 puffs per cigarette.\n\nThere\u2019s also the nicotine aspect. Smoking enough hookah could easily trigger addiction, ultimately leading more easily into other tobacco products like cigarettes.\n\nDespite the increasing number of studies pointing to hookah\u2019s risks, people continue to be unaware and assume it\u2019s safer than cigarettes. \u201cIn casual conversations with friends and patients, folks often appreciate that smoking anything comes with risks,\u201d Adrienne J. Heinz, who researches alcohol and drug use patterns at the Stanford University School of Medicine, told Reuters. \u201cHowever, hookah is certainly viewed as more benign, and when you share general facts about toxin exposure in one hookah session, it often shocks and surprises them.\u201d Heinz also points out that there hasn\u2019t been a strong public health campaign to raise awareness about the dangers of hookah smoke, the way there is for cigarettes. \u201cThere is also the misconception that because hookah sessions tend to be less frequent than smoking a cigarette, and because hookah is smoked through a water chamber, that the practice is safer,\u201d Heinz told Reuters.\n\nSource: Blachman-Braun R, Lira Del Mazo-Rodriguez R, L\u00f3pez-S\u00e1mano G, Buend\u00eda-Rold\u00e1n I. \u201cHookah, is it really harmless?\u201d Respiratory Medicine, 2014.", "article_metadata": {"msapplication-config": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "news_keywords": "hookah smoking, cigarettes, nicotine, hookah hazards, shisha, health and hookah, heart disease, cancer", "og": {"site_name": "Medical Daily", "description": "Research about the detriments of smoking hookah has been growing, and a new study points to the possibility of heart disease and cancer from long-term use.", "title": "Smoking Hookah Could Give You Heart Disease And Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dangers-smoking-hookah-long-term-use-can-lead-heart-disease-and-cancer-269923", "image": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/22/hookah.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Research about the detriments of smoking hookah has been growing, and a new study points to the possibility of heart disease and cancer from long-term use.", "title": "Smoking Hookah Could Give You Heart Disease And Cancer", "url": "http://www.medicaldaily.com/dangers-smoking-hookah-long-term-use-can-lead-heart-disease-and-cancer-269923", "image": {"src": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/22/hookah.jpg", "identifier": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/files/2014/02/22/hookah.jpg"}, "site": "@medicaldaily", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#f1c40f", "fb": {"app_id": 650103655065474}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://images.medicaldaily.com/sites/medicaldaily.com/themes/medicaldaily/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "keywords": "medical daily, medicaldaily.com, health news, medical news, medical science, medicine, drugs, treatment, disease", "article": {"section": "Healthy Living", "published_time": "2014-02-22T18:26:13-05:00", "modified_time": "2014-02-22T18:26:12-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "Research about the detriments of smoking hookah has been growing, and a new study points to the possibility of heart disease and cancer from long-term use."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fc9b26\"", "article_summary": "Smoking hookah originated in the Indian peninsula then spread throughout Europe and is now popular in the West.\nBut another study has emerged warning of the potentially harmful effects of smoking hookah, which has commonly been considered less dangerous than tobacco smoke.\nHookah smoking has become more popular in the U.S. among young people and college students, because of the belief that it is somehow safer than smoking cigarettes.\nSmoking tobacco through water doesn\u2019t necessarily filter out any of these toxins that can damage the lungs and heart.\nIn a study completed in 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) discovered that many hookah smokers believe it\u2019s less risky than cigarette smoking."}
