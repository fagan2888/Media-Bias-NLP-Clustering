They surveyed managers, asking what they thought were the most important factors in influencing motivation and emotions at work. Managers ranked \u201crecognition, incentives, interpersonal support, and clear goals\u201d as top. \u201cSupport for making progress\u201d was ranked as dead last as a motivator. So managers had it wrong.\n\nHow did Amabile and Kramer come to their conclusion? They conducted research focused on the inner work lives of employees (not managers) by inviting 238 people in seven companies to keep a daily diary of their perceptions, emotions and motivations each day\u2014yielding 12,000 diary entries that they then analyzed.\n\nAmabile and Kramer say: \u201cInner work life matters for companies because, no matter how brilliant a company\u2019s strategy might be, the strategy\u2019s execution depends on great performance by people inside the organization.\u201d They were surprised when they found that the particularly most powerful force supporting inner work life is the ability to make progress in meaningful work.\n\nBut \u201cmeaningful\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily require working on things that have a profound importance to society. The authors say: \u201cWhat matters is whether you perceive your work as contributing value to something or someone who matters (even your team, yourself, or your family).\u201d\n\nI was struck by this same insight a few years ago when I talked with someone trying to fix a dysfunctional state government bureau that dealt with rescinding drivers\u2019 licenses for drunk drivers. The employees were notorious for taking months to respond to court orders. But my friend invited a state trooper to speak to an all-hands staff meeting of the bureau. He emotionally told them about the death of a little girl by a drunk driver whose license had not been suspended in time\u2014and how important their work is to him in keeping such drivers off the street. He helped them understand why their seemingly mind-numbing paper-processing was important to the community. Shortly after, the processing sped up dramatically. The employees had the meaningfulness of their work clarified.\n\nAs psychologists, Amabile and Kramer understand that: \u201cMost people have strong intrinsic motivation to do their work . . . as long as the work is meaningful, managers do not have to spend time coming up with ways to motivate people to do the work. They are much better served by removing barriers to progress, helping people experience the intrinsic satisfaction that derives from accomplishment.\u201d\n\nSo, they conclude: \u201cAny manager\u2019s job description should start with facilitating subordinates\u2019 progress every day.\u201d This may be obvious to front-line workers, but not so obvious to managers.\n\nSo, if you are a manager, commit to removing at least one barrier before you leave the office today.\n\n(Image via Helder Almeida/Shutterstock.com)", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "John Kamensky", "description": "Many think recognition and incentives are the answer.", "og": {"site_name": "Government Executive", "description": "Many think recognition and incentives are the answer.", "title": "The Key to Employee Engagement?
