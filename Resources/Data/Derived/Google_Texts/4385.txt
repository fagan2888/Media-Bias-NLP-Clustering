(CNN) - Chicago's new archbishop does not plan to live in the $14 million mansion that housed many of his predecessors but was seen by some Catholics as out of touch with Pope Francis' emphasis on simplicity.

Instead, Archbishop Blase Cupich, a moderate in the mold of Francis, will live in the rectory of Holy Name Cathedral, the archdiocese of Chicago announced Wednesday.

Cupich, who came to Chicago from Spokane, Washington, acknowledged the mansion's long history as a home for the city's Catholic leaders, but wanted to live near the cathedral so he could celebrate Mass there as much as possible, the archdiocese said.

This summer, CNN reported on the multimillion dollar homes of several American archbishops, including Chicago's former leader, Cardinal Francis George. According to appraisers, the mansion where George lives with several priests is worth at least $14.3 million.

In addition to the residence area, the historic mansion includes offices, a space for receptions and a 5,800-square-foot coach house where three nuns live.

Cupich will use the mansion to host guests and hold functions, the archdiocese said, and has established an Archbishop’s Residence Committee to study how best to use it.

Since his election in 2013, Pope Francis has urged Catholic leaders to live simple, frugal lives.

"The hypocrisy of those consecrated men and women who profess vows of poverty, yet live like the rich, wounds the souls of the faithful and harms the Church,” he told Catholic bishops in Asia this August.
