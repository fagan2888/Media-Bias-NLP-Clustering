Synthetic life. Genetically coded on a computer, and popped to life. Specifications dropped in by a human hand. Self-replicating and ready to go. It was a bombshell in biology circles. The rest of the world is still taking it onboard. Now Venter\u2019s talking about it as a challenge to our understanding of life itself. A boon, he hopes. And maybe a teleporter, too. Up next On Point: Craig Venter on the advance of synthetic life.\n\n\u2014 Tom Ashbrook\n\nGuest\n\nJ. Craig Venter, molecular biologist and entrepreneur, author of \u201cLife At the Speed of Light: From the Double Helix to the Dawn of Digital Life.\u201d Founder and CEO of the J. Craig Venter Institute and of Synthetic Genomics, Inc. (@JCVenter)\n\nFrom Tom\u2019s Reading List\n\nForeign Affairs: Biology\u2019s Brave New World \u2014 \u201cLooking at the strings of letters representing the DNA sequence for a virus called phi X174, which infects bacteria, he thought to himself, \u2018I can assemble real DNA based on that computer information.\u2019 And so he did, creating a virus based on the phi X174 genomic code. He followed the same recipe later on to generate the DNA for his larger and more sophisticated creature. Venter and his team figured out how to make an artificial bacterial cell, inserted their man-made DNA genome inside, and watched as the organic life form they had synthesized moved, ate, breathed, and replicated itself.\u201d\n\nNBC News: Genomics pioneer Craig Venter warns about biohacker boo-boos \u2014 \u201cAs Venter points out in his book, \u2018Life at the Speed of Light,\u2019 he\u2019s not the only one worried about biohacker boo-boos. Almost three years ago, a presidential commission on bioethics raised concerns about the risk of \u201clow-probability, high-impact events\u201d such as the creation of a doomsday virus. Bioterror is one aspect of the issue, but Venter says he\u2019s also concerned about bio-error \u2014 \u2018the fallout that could occur as the result of DNA manipulation by a non-scientifically trained biohacker or \u2018biopunk.\u201d\u201d\n\nThe Guardian: \u2018This isn\u2019t a fantasy look at the future. We are doing the future\u2019 \u2014 \u201cA reader could be forgiven for thinking the book is really aimed at the Nobel prize committee, but Venter claims he just wants more people to understand him. \u2018One of the motivations for the book is to put this in a historical context because of all the confusion out there when we did it,\u2019 he says. \u2018I think the work that we have done with the first genome in history, the human genome and with the first synthetic cell is certainly of the world caliber that obviously earns big prizes.'\u201d\n\nRead An Excerpt of \u201cLife At the Speed of Light: From the Double Helix to the Dawn of Digital Life\u201d by J.
