Both are 59 and said diving into bone-chilling water helps them \u201ckeep in touch with our inner insanity.\u201d\n\nOrganizers said around 250 people participated in the event, which was held at the Lake Shawnee swim beach, 3300 S.E. Croco Road.\n\nEach person who ran or walked into the water at the Lake Shawnee swim beach paid $75, with all proceeds benefiting the Kansas Special Olympics.\n\nKristi Powell, a detective with the Topeka Police Department and one of the event organizers, estimated the Polar Plunge and a related run generated about $35,000 for Kansas Special Olympics.\n\nFunds will be used for people with developmental disabilities to participate in athletic and social events through Kansas Special Olympics. Proceeds also help pay for medical and educational programs for Special Olympics participants.\n\nPowell said Saturday\u2019s Polar Plunge, which started with the Topeka temperature hovering around the 25-degree mark, was considerably colder than the past couple of years. Crews had to cut a large hole in the ice with chain saws so that participants could get into the water.\n\nIn spite of the cold conditions, people dressed up in an assortment of costumes for the Polar Plunge. Some wore summer-style swimsuits, while others decked out in superhero costumes.\n\nThe majority took part as a member of teams that raised funds for Special Olympics, while some went in solo.\n\nEach group started about 25 yards up the snow-covered sandy beach, then ran headlong into the water. Some went in up to their ankles, while others made it up to their waists. The really brave dove in and went completely under the water.\n\n\u201cWe have some people who have participated each and every year,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThe crazy ones remain crazy.\u201d\n\nMost of the participants were adults, though a number of high school students also ran into the water to help raise funds for Special Olympics. Among them were five girls from Shawnee Heights High School \u2014 Kellie Schmick, 16; Kourtney Schmick, 14; Karli Benson, 16; Emily Wilson, 15; and Cassidy Copeland, 15.\n\nThe girls represented the school\u2019s Junior Civitan Club and said they had done the Polar Plunge a year ago.\n\nShortly before taking the plunge, Wilson said she \u201cjust wanted to get it over with.\u201d\n\nAfter going into the water and coming back to shore, the girls were in agreement that this was one tradition they planned on maintaining again next year.", "article_metadata": {"keywords": "News, Local, Phil Anderson", "og": {"site_name": "CJOnline.com", "description": "As he awaited his turn to run into the frigid waters of Lake Shawnee on Saturday morning for the 10th annual Polar Plunge, Larry Bing went over his strategy for all who cared to listen. \r\n\"Don't think about it,\" he said. \"Just go.\" \r\nThen he elaborated.", "title": "Polar Plunge nets $35,000 for Special Olympics", "url": "http://cjonline.com/news/2014-02-01/polar-plunge-nets-35000-special-olympics", "image": "http://cjonline.com/sites/default/files/13048028.jpg", "type": "article"}, "description": "As he awaited his turn to run into the frigid waters of Lake Shawnee on Saturday morning for the 10th annual Polar Plunge, Larry Bing went over his strategy for all who cared to listen.\u201cDon\u2019t think about it,\u201d he said. \u201cJust go.\u201dThen he elaborated.\u201cYou run in as fast as you can, you get in where it\u2019s deep enough to dive horizontally, then you submerge yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cThen you get up and give everybody a high-five.\u201d"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdddca\"", "article_summary": "The girls represented the school\u2019s Junior Civitan Club and said they had done the Polar Plunge a year ago.\nKristi Powell, a detective with the Topeka Police Department and one of the event organizers, estimated the Polar Plunge and a related run generated about $35,000 for Kansas Special Olympics.\nFunds will be used for people with developmental disabilities to participate in athletic and social events through Kansas Special Olympics.\nIn spite of the cold conditions, people dressed up in an assortment of costumes for the Polar Plunge.\nThe majority took part as a member of teams that raised funds for Special Olympics, while some went in solo."}
