Critics say the new laws effectively legalize discrimination against women and the country\u2019s minority Muslims.\n\nREAD: Myanmar\u2019s president signs off on law seen as targeting Muslims\n\nAlong with political clout, Ma Ba Tha is also ratcheting up its public image ahead of elections in November that will be the first free vote in Myanmar in the last 25 years. The radical Buddhist group has regular programming on one of the country\u2019s most popular satellite TV channels and has launched a magazine.\n\n\u201cThere should be lawmakers in parliament who are reliable for the country,\u201d Ashin Tilawkar Biwonsa said in an interview. \u201cThere might be some people, especially Muslims, who are working on weakening Buddhism, so we need strong people for our religion.\u201d\n\nMa Ba Tha has shown no signs of contesting elections itself but says it will \u201cremind\u201d the public of candidates who opposed its four laws. These include Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and her opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), which is going head to head with conservatives and military figures in the polls.\n\nEstablished two years ago, Ma Ba Tha sprang from the \u201c969\u201d movement, a loose collection of monks linked to a wave of violence against the country\u2019s Muslim minority in 2012 and 2013.\n\nSenior Ma Ba Tha officials said the 969 movement had raised awareness about threats to Buddhism from a burgeoning Muslim population, but was disorganized and lacked leadership.\n\n\u201cIt was (concerned with) only the symbols of Buddhism,\u201d said Ashin Tilawkar Biwonsa.\n\nNow, a growing number of professionals are offering their expertise on everything from media relations to legislation, helping to shape Ma Ba Tha into a slick organization with popular support and real political clout.\n\nOne such expert is Aye Paing, who spent two decades toiling as a lawyer in Myanmar\u2019s musty courtrooms before finding a dramatic new use for his legal skills.\n\nAye Paing and a team of Ma Ba Tha-linked lawyers drafted the protection of race and religion bills, the last of which was signed by President Thein Sein on Monday.\n\nLawyers, economists, IT experts and other professionals had made Ma Ba Tha \u201cvery efficient, systematic and legal\u201d said Aye Paing, 52, who wears a black \u201ctaik pone,\u201d a short collarless jacket worn over a shirt that is common among Myanmar\u2019s legal professionals.\n\n\u201cWe discuss, give advice and share our visions,\u201d he said.\n\nINTERNATIONAL VISITORS\n\nIn another sign of its growing influence, foreign diplomats regularly visit the group\u2019s monastery headquarters.\n\nOne was U.S. ambassador Derek Mitchell, who went there twice in May to discuss \u201cthe need for increased interfaith dialog\u201d and \u201cthe importance of keeping religion out of politics,\u201d according to a statement from the U.S. embassy in Yangon.\n\nMyanmar\u2019s revered and influential monks led many pro-democracy protests during nearly half a century of military rule in the Buddhist-majority nation. But after a quasi-civilian, reformist government took power in 2011, some outspoken monks claimed Islam was eclipsing Buddhism and weakening the country.\n\nREAD: RNS\u2019 series on religious freedom and conflict in Myanmar\n\nNow, Ashin Tilawkar Biwonsa says Ma Ba Tha has 250 offices nationwide. He couldn\u2019t estimate how many supporters it has, but in June more than 1,500 people attended the group\u2019s annual conference in Yangon.\n\nMa Ba Tha recently struck a deal with Myanmar\u2019s popular satellite television provider, SkyNet, to broadcast its sermons.\n\nThe broadcasts would help the public \u201cknow the truth\u201d about Ma Ba Tha, said Khine Khine Tun, 25, an articulate former teacher and interpreter who heads the group\u2019s international relations department.\n\nThrough media training courses, she said, she has learnt to speak to visitors with a smile, confounding expectations of the abrasive and sometimes confrontational style for which the group is known.\n\nThe television deal bolsters an information campaign that already includes a bi-monthly magazine with a circulation of 50,000 that contains sermons delivered by Ma Ba Tha monks nationwide.\n\nRACE AND RELIGION\n\nIn contrast to long-delayed legislation on banking, mining and property, the Ma Ba Tha-backed \u201crace and religion\u201d bills moved swiftly through parliament.\n\nOne bill requires some women to wait at least three years between pregnancies. Another requires Buddhist women to seek official permission before marrying a non-Buddhist man.\n\nThis will stop Muslim men \u201ctorturing and forcing (Buddhist women) to change religion,\u201d Ashin Tilawkar Biwonsa said.\n\nSuu Kyi and her NLD opposed the laws. But government officials and politicians rarely criticize Ma Ba Tha, because they either sympathize with the group\u2019s views or fear upsetting its many supporters during an election year.\n\n\u201cThey are afraid of Ma Ba Tha,\u201d said May Sabi Phyu, the director of the Gender Equality Network, a women\u2019s empowerment group that opposed the bills.\n\nAny plans to sway voters would be \u201cviolating the law,\u201d said NLD spokesman Nyan Win, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s the government\u2019s responsibility to control and stop them.\u201d\n\n(By Timothy Mclaughlin and Hnin Yadana Zaw; Additional reporting by Andrew R.C.
