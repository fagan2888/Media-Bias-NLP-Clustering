With the death of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia early Friday, we look at the sometimes awkward moments he\u2019s shared with American presidents. And Mr. Obama courts the YouTube generation in a conversation with three video bloggers.\n\nThe death of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia will usher in a new era of relations between the United States and its most stalwart Arab ally.\n\nIt will also bring to a close a diplomatic chapter in which a succession of United States presidents found themselves in awkward situations caught on film.\n\nPresident Obama, in one example, was photographed in 2009 greeting Abdullah on the sidelines of the G-20 summit meeting in London. In an image seen around the world, the American president was shown stooped in front of the king.\n\nThe Washington Times called it a \u201cshocking display of fealty to a foreign potentate,\u201d and said that by \u201cbending over to show greater respect to Islam, the U.S. president belittled the power and independence of the United States.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials said it was not a bow, that Mr. Obama was only reaching to shake the king\u2019s hand.\n\nFour years earlier, a picture of President George W. Bush and Abdullah generated its own commentary. During Abdullah\u2019s visit to Mr. Bush\u2019s ranch in Crawford, Tex., the president and the king were photographed holding hands \u2014 a traditional Saudi gesture of friendship. Late-night comics made it a running joke and resurrected photos of Mr. Bush kissing Abdullah on the cheek.\n\nMr. Obama\u2019s final visit with the king in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, in the spring of 2014 was a somber affair. By then, Abdullah was already ill, and the image of the ailing king using an oxygen tank offered the world \u2014 and the Saudi people \u2014 a foreshadowing of his passing.\n\n\u2014 Michael D. Shear\n\nThis may be the first weekend of the 2016 presidential campaign, even though we, so far, have no official candidates.\n\nThere\u2019s Jeb Bush in San Francisco, where the former Florida governor will speak Friday at a conference for car dealers and take questions for the first time since announcing that he might seek the White House.\n\nOn Saturday, prominent Republicans from across the country head to Iowa. The state\u2019s caucuses \u2014 the opening round in every presidential contest \u2014 are a year away. The attraction this weekend is Representative Steve King\u2019s annual Freedom Summit.\n\nGov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, former Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas have all promised to be there to show their support of \u201cpro-growth economics, social conservatism and a strong national defense.\u201d\n\nIt will be a busy travel weekend for Mr. Cruz, who\u2019s also been invited to the annual \u201cKoch primary\u201d hosted by Charles G. and David H. Koch, the billionaire brothers and conservative patrons. The retreat, held at a Palm Springs, Calif., resort, will provide entr\u00e9e to the brothers\u2019 vast donor network.\n\nOfficially, it\u2019s called the American Recovery Policy Forum, and Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Rand Paul of Kentucky have also said they\u2019d be there. Mr. Cruz, Mr. Rubio and Mr. Paul will take part in a group discussion on Sunday night led by Jonathan Karl, the ABC News correspondent.\n\n\u2014 Alan Rappeport\n\nPresident Obama takes off early on Saturday for India, leaving behind at least some of the worries of Washington for what promises to be a warmer reception than he received on Capitol Hill for his State of the Union address this week.\n\nHe will be the first American president honored as the chief guest of the country\u2019s Republic Day parade on the anniversary of its democratic Constitution coming into force.\n\nIt will also be the first time that Mr. Obama will be in the open air amid giant crowds in a foreign country for such an extended period.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say the Secret Service isn\u2019t thrilled. The agency generally puts a president behind bulletproof glass shields, but it can\u2019t protect him from the awkward geopolitics \u2014 much of the military hardware during the parade will be Russian-made.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, who has struck a friendship of sorts with Mr. Obama, will host the president and Michelle Obama for a state dinner. The Obamas will wrap up three days on the ground with a tour of the Taj Mahal.\n\nMr. Obama also visited India in 2010, making him the first American president to go twice while in office.\n\n\u2014 Peter Baker\n\nSenator Harry Reid met Thursday with the Capitol press corps \u2014 on camera. It was the latest of his concerted efforts to show that a serious exercise injury was not going to have long-term consequences for his re-election bid next year or his role as the Senate\u2019s top Democrat.\n\nSince the accident in his Nevada home on Jan. 1, Mr. Reid, 75, and his staff have released photos and video that most politicians would have been reluctant to make public. They showed Mr. Reid\u2019s badly bruised face and a large bandage covering his right eye.\n\nHealth is one subject that makes all politicians touchy: They don\u2019t want to stir thoughts of vulnerability or retirement. And with eye surgery scheduled for Monday and the prospect of at least another week away from the Capitol, Mr. Reid wants to make clear that he is not going away, particularly with a potentially tough re-election approaching.\n\n\u201cWe have quite an operation in Nevada that hasn\u2019t lost a step,\u201d Mr. Reid said. \u201cWe\u2019re off and running.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nIt was a minor milestone, but Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky made the most of it on Thursday in announcing that the Senate had voted on 15 amendments in its first three weeks, matching the number for all of last year.\n\n\u201cThis is the way the Senate ought to work,\u201d Mr. McConnell said.\n\nThe dearth of Senate floor fights under Democratic control had been a major source of tension over the past few years. Before the November election, Republicans attacked Senator Mark Begich of Alaska (who lost) for not securing a single vote on an amendment during his six years in office.\n\nSenator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat, said his party deserved credit for its cooperative attitude. It was a swipe at what Democrats considered as the entirely uncooperative attitude of Republicans when they were in the minority.\n\nRepublicans made their own subtle point. Senator Dan Sullivan, who defeated Mr. Begich, was among those to get a vote on one of his amendments.\n\n\u2014 Carl Hulse\n\nPresident Obama will deliver remarks to the United States Conference of Mayors at the White House.\n\nVice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will visit West Los Angeles College in California to discuss \u201cthe importance of helping Americans go to college.\u201d Mr. Biden\u2019s office also announced Thursday night that he would \u201cbe leading a presidential delegation representing the United States to pay our respects and offer condolences to King Abdullah\u2019s family and nation.\u201d\n\nThe National Association of Realtors will release existing home sales statistics for December.\n\nThe interrogators, the location and even some of the answers were unusual.\n\nBut a presidential interview is still a presidential interview, even if some of the questions come from a woman in bright green lipstick who calls herself GloZell Green.\n\nMs. Green is a YouTube star, one of three selected for a nontraditional question-and-answer follow-up to President Obama\u2019s State of the Union address. It was broadcast on the White House\u2019s own YouTube channel.\n\nHe and the video bloggers talked about cybersecurity, foreign affairs and how to make college more affordable. But one, Bethany Mota, also wanted to know about the president\u2019s dream superpower. \u201cFlying seems pretty cool,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Obama said the conversation was a way to reach \u201caudiences that get turned off by the traditional news shows or the traditional debates.\u201d Collectively, the three video stars have more than 13 million subscribers \u2014 eight million for Ms. Mota, three million for Ms. Green and two million for Hank Green, the third blogger in on the interviews. (Mr. Green and his brother John, author of \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d run the Vlogbrothers channel.)\n\nThe novice interviewers occasionally betrayed a case of nerves. Ms. Green brought her trademark lipsticks as gifts for the president\u2019s wife and daughters. But she fumbled her words and said it was a present for \u201chis first wife.\u201d\n\nMr. Obama was quick with a quip: \u201cDo you know something I don\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Elena Schneider\n\nA look at the life of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, and the country\u2019s new leader, King Salman.\n\nPresident Obama has no plans to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visits Washington to address Congress in March.\n\nMartin Scorsese\u2019s partly finished documentary about Bill Clinton has stalled over disagreements about control.\n\nThere are chaotic repercussions in Albany after the arrest of the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver. Jim Dwyer\u2019s take on Mr. Silver\u2019s fall.\n\nThe objection of some Republican women to a bill that would ban abortion after 20 weeks has opened a new rift in the party.\n\nIn The New Yorker, Ryan Lizza and Hendrik Hertzberg discuss the long-term significance of this week\u2019s State of the Union address.\n\nMs. Magazine surveys the attitude toward abortion among women born after the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973.\n\nAnna Goldenberg of The Jewish Daily Forward details what it takes to get tickets to \u201cThe Daily Show With Jon Stewart.\u201d\n\nRich Lowry, writing in Politico Magazine, says President Obama has an unhealthy obsession with the prison in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba.\n\nComcast\u2019s \u201clobbying machine\u201d in Washington is being tested over debates about net neutrality and the company\u2019s proposed merger with Time Warner Cable, according to The Wall Street Journal.", "article_metadata": {"BN": "first-draft", "adxPage": "blog.nytimes.com/first-draft/2015/01/23", "PT": "Blogs", "SCG": "First Draft", "CG": "Politics", "dfp-ad-unit-path": "us/politics/firstdraft", "robots": "noodp", "sourceApp": "blogs", "live_stream_endpoint": "http://static01.nyt.com/live-coverage/first-draft/live-stream-endpoint-01232015.jsonp", "keywords": "politics, congress, midterms, elections, 2014, 2016, house, senate, advertising, political advertising, campaign finance, senator, Obama, Boehner, Clinton, Hillary, Hillary Clinton, Reid, McConnell, Christie, Paul, Washington, capitol", "ad_sensitivity": "noxxl", "article": {"section": "Politics"}, "nyt_active_day": 0, "twitter": {"description": "Political News, Now.", "title": "First Draft", "url": "http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/01/23/", "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/nytdesign/2014/politics/logo-flag-150.png", "site": "@NYTPolitics", "card": "summary"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcb62c\"", "article_summary": "And Mr. Obama courts the YouTube generation in a conversation with three video bloggers.\n(Mr. Green and his brother John, author of \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d run the Vlogbrothers channel.)\nWith the death of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia early Friday, we look at the sometimes awkward moments he\u2019s shared with American presidents.\nPresident Obama, in one example, was photographed in 2009 greeting Abdullah on the sidelines of the G-20 summit meeting in London.\nMr. Obama also visited India in 2010, making him the first American president to go twice while in office."}
