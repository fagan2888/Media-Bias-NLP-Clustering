Cory Gardner has asked the secretary of Health and Human Services to investigate whether a Colorado health care cooperative is financially solvent.\n\nGardner, a Colorado Republican, sent a letter Monday to Sylvia Burwellquestioning the ability of Colorado HealthOP to repay its federal loans.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act created cooperatives as an alternative to private insurance coverage. It also provided federal loans, including $72 million to Colorado HealthOP.\n\nHe wrote that health cooperatives in Louisiana, Nevada, Iowa and Nebraska had failed, costing taxpayers $277 million. Last week, New York authorities ordered its cooperative to stop writing new policies and wind down business after existing policies expire, citing financial concerns.\n\n\u201cHas Colorado HealthOP been meeting its application projections, or has it been placed on boosted oversight by your agency?\u201d he asked.\n\nAnd, using agency measurements, \u201cwhat is the estimated ability of Colorado HealthOP to repay its loans?\u201d\n\nJulia Hutchins, the cooperative\u2019s chief executive, responded that it has successfully created a fast-growing, low-cost alternative to private health insurance.\n\n\u201cThings are going really great. We\u2019re in a really good position to be able to pay taxpayers back,\u201d she said. Most of the loans can be repayed over a 15-year period, she said.\n\nIn one year, the cooperative has grown from insuring 14,000 individuals and small businesses to 80,000, \u201cbringing down the cost of health care to Colorado,\u201d she said.\n\nColorado HealthOP cut its prices for 2015 plans but is seeking a rate increase averaging 25 percent for next year.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re certainly not happy with that,\u201d Hutchins said, but the cooperative would still offer a low-cost plan if the state approves its request.\n\nHutchins said the cooperative serves many people in rural communities who had done without insurance.\n\nAlex Siciliano, a Gardner spokesman, said his request was based partly on an HHS inspector general\u2019s report this year that the majority of cooperatives did not meet initial enrollment and profitability projections.\n\nThe report found that all but one of the 23 cooperatives lost money in 2014. Colorado HealthOP\u2019s $23 million loss was among the largest. The cooperative had projected a $5.6 million loss for 2014. It has projected a $2.8 million loss this year and net income of $1.8 million in 2016.\n\nVincent Plymell, a Colorado Division of Insurance spokesman, said that during the past year, \u201cthe HealthOP has met the minimum capital and surplus requirements of the division and state law.\u201d\n\nDavid Olinger: 303-954-1498, dolinger@denverpost.com or @dolingerdp", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Sen.
