Every fund in the Thrift Savings Plan, except the one invested in government securities, fell in June, according to the latest data from the board overseeing the TSP.

The international (I) fund had the worst month, dropping 2.8 percent in June. The fund, however, has gained 6.52 percent since the start of the year.

Three other main TSP funds also decreased in June: The C Fund, invested in common stocks, fell 1.93 percent; fixed-income bonds (F Fund) decreased 1.07 percent; and the S Fund, invested in small and midsize companies, dipped 0.71 percent. All three are still in the positive column for the year-to-date. Since January, the C Fund has gained 1.26 percent, while the F Fund has increased 0.05 percent and the S Fund has risen 4.96 percent.

The government securities (G) fund, the safest of the TSP offerings, inched up 0.17 percent in June, increasing 0.96 percent since January.

The lifecycle funds – designed to move investors to a safer portfolio as they near retirement – all ended June in the red, which is unusual. The L Income fund, for those who have already started withdrawing money, fell 0.33 percent last month; L 2020 was down 0.97 percent; L 2030 decreased 1.28 percent; L 2040 fell 1.46 percent; and L 2050 posted a negative return of 1.66 percent.
