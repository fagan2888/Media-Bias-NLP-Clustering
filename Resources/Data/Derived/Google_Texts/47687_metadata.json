Kelly described the verdict as \u201cexceptionally painful.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday is a tragic day for my family and me as we process the many ways this will impact us, both in this life and in the eternities,\u201d she said on Ordain Women\u2019s site Monday.\n\n\u201cI love the gospel and the courage of its people. Don\u2019t leave. Stay, and make things better.\u201d\n\nNo harsher punishment exists for a Latter-day Saint.\n\nKelly was excommunicated \u201cfor conduct contrary to the laws and order of the Church,\u201d Harrison wrote.\n\n\u201cIn order to be considered for readmission to the Church, you will need to demonstrate over a period of time that you have stopped teachings and actions that undermine the Church, its leaders, and the doctrine of the priesthood,\" he said.\n\n\"The difficulty, Sister Kelly, is not that you say you have questions or even that you believe that women should receive the priesthood,\" Harrison continued. \"The problem is that you have persisted in an aggressive effort to persuade other Church members to your point of view and that your course of action has threatened to erode the faith of others.\"\n\nWhat got Kelly, a human-rights attorney who now lives in Utah, in trouble was the 2013 launching of Ordain Women, a movement pushing for the ordination of women to the priesthood.\n\nThrough social media, a website and public protests, the group has gathered steam \u2013 and put Kelly in hot water.\n\nIn May, Kelly was put on probation for her activities. She was also asked to take her website down. She refused, and letters of support, many of which can still be found on the site today, poured in.\n\nBy early June, Kelly knew she would face a disciplinary council. At the time, she wrote about the threat of excommunication in her church, calling it \u201cakin to spiritual death.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe life-saving ordinances you have participated in like baptism, confirmation, and temple sealing are moot,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIn effect, you are being forcibly evicted from your forever family.\u201d\n\nMormons believe family members, in good church standing, are bound for eternity.\n\nBy being excommunicated, Kelly can no longer wear her temple garments or enter LDS Church temples. She cannot tithe or give offerings.\n\nShe cannot take the sacrament (known in many Christian churches as Communion), receive a calling to serve the church or give talks in the church. She is banned from offering prayers in church meetings and cannot vote for church officers.\n\nKelly, however, vowed, to keep fighting.\n\n\u201cI will not stop speaking out publicly on the issue of gender inequality in the church,\u201d she wrote Sunday in a letter to the disciplinary council. \u201cI cannot repent of telling the truth, speaking what is in my heart and asking questions that burn in my soul.\u201d\n\nThe LDS Church, which doesn\u2019t employ professional clergy and instead calls members to serve in volunteer leadership positions, is patriarchal in nature.\n\nFrom the combined post of president and prophet to other ecclesiastical leaders, it\u2019s a male-dominated world. Only men can enter the priesthood, which grants a person the authority to, for example, perform baptisms and offer sacramental blessings.\n\n\"The pattern of ordaining men to the priesthood was established by Christ in His Church, and is followed in His restored Church today,\" LDS Church spokesman Eric Hawkins wrote in a statement to CNN late Monday night.\n\n\"The worth of a human soul is not defined by a set of duties or responsibilities,\" Hawkins said. \"In God\u2019s plan for His children, both women and men have the same access to the guidance of His spirit, to revelation, faith and repentance, to grace and the atonement of His Son, Jesus Christ, and are received equally as they approach Him in prayer.\"\n\nBut the all-male priesthood practice doesn\u2019t match what the LDS Church teaches, Kelly and her organization argue.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental tenets of Mormonism support gender equality: God is male and female, father and mother, and all of us can progress to be like them someday. Priesthood, we are taught, is essential to this process,\u201d the group's website reads.\n\n\u201cOrdain Women believes women must be ordained in order for our faith to reflect the equity and expansiveness of these teachings.\u201d\n\nThe mission statement then seizes on language about equality that was crafted by the LDS Church itself in 2012.\n\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is for everyone. The Book of Mormon states, \"black and white, bond and free, male and female; \u2026 all are alike unto God\" (2Nepi 26:33). This is the Church\u2019s official teaching.\n\nThe intention, going back to the LDS Church founder, was to treat women equally, activist and author Joanna Brooks explained in a late-night Monday e-mail to CNN.\n\n\"Joseph Smith told Mormon women he'd make them a 'kingdom of priests.' There is plenty of theological and historical evidence that Smith viewed participation in LDS temple rites as conveying a form of priesthood on men and women alike,\" wrote Brooks, author of \"The Book of Mormon Girl: Stories from an American Faith.\"\n\n\"But after his death, and especially in the 20th century, this view started receding, along with other exercises of spiritual authority and leadership by Mormon women,\" she said. \"In the 1930s, one LDS leader introduced the idea that priesthood and motherhood should be viewed as parallel.\"\n\nWhen the church issued the 1995 \"Proclamation of the Family,\" which highlights family and gender responsibilities, the idea was \"nearly canonized,\" Brooks said.\n\nKelly, who counts men among her supporters, certainly isn\u2019t the first to fight this fight. Plenty of other Latter-day Saints members have led this charge before her.\n\nFeminists were among six prominent Mormon scholars punished, some with excommunication, in an LDS Church crackdown in September 1993. Other women have simply walked away.\n\nBut Kelly, who submitted a letter of defense to the disciplinary panel, appears to have been a faithful church member \u2013 even as she\u2019s asked questions.\n\nInstead of flying cross-country to her disciplinary council, Kelly attended an Ordain Women organized vigil in Salt Lake City. It was one of dozens held across the country and the globe.\n\nShe described in the letter her commitment to the gospel from a young age, her excitement about her baptism at age 8 and her pride about being different while growing up in Oregon. She served as a missionary in Barcelona, Spain, and in 2006 was married in the LDS Church\u2019s Salt Lake Temple.\n\nTo punish her, Kelly added in the letter, would also be a punishment of \u201canyone with a question in their heart who wants to ask that question vocally, openly and publicly.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "By Jessica Ravitz, CNN (CNN) -- Kate Kelly, a lifelong Mormon who\u2019s spearheaded a fight for equal opportunities for women\u00a0in her church, was convicted of apostasy Monday and excommunicated from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "title": "Mormon feminist excommunicated for apostasy", "og": {"url": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/06/24/mormon-who-advocated-ordination-of-women-is-excommunicated/", "image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/140624081151-kate-kelly-story-top.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "By Jessica Ravitz, CNN\r\n\r\n(CNN) -- Kate Kelly, a lifelong Mormon who\u2019s spearheaded a fight for equal opportunities for women\u00a0in her church, was convicted of apostasy Monday and excommunicated from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.", "title": "Mormon feminist excommunicated for apostasy"}, "msvalidate.01": "DE341CAC7D45B696ED1776216C18054C", "fb": {"admins": 690014395, "app_id": 80401312489}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CNN Belief Blog", "keywords": "church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, gender issues, mormonism, women,", "google-site-verification": "mFBa4OnyEDU23vgVJ6rtX_4izud7FIi9JiscfVsWaKk", "original-source": "http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/06/24/mormon-who-advocated-ordination-of-women-is-excommunicated/", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/feed/;icon-uri=https://s2.wp.com/i/favicon.ico"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdbb3e\"", "article_summary": "Feminists were among six prominent Mormon scholars punished, some with excommunication, in an LDS Church crackdown in September 1993.\n\"Joseph Smith told Mormon women he'd make them a 'kingdom of priests.'\nBy being excommunicated, Kelly can no longer wear her temple garments or enter LDS Church temples.\n\"But after his death, and especially in the 20th century, this view started receding, along with other exercises of spiritual authority and leadership by Mormon women,\" she said.\nBut the all-male priesthood practice doesn\u2019t match what the LDS Church teaches, Kelly and her organization argue."}
