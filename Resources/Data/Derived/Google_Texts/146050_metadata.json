The first year, he raced out too hard, crumbled on the climb, and lost the yellow jersey. Last year, he was up 30 seconds at the intermediate split, but only four seconds ahead at the finish.\n\n\u201cThis year I felt powerful all the way through,\u201d he said.\n\nPHOTOS: USA Pro Challenge 2014, Stage 6\n\nFor a brief moment, the spotlight shone on Tom Danielson. The 36-year-old cyclist for Boulder-based Team Garmin-Sharp, who was left off the Tour de France team this year, rode the best time trial of his season in 25:19.26, eclipsing his previous best up the pass by 45 seconds.\n\n\u201cFor a moment there, I saw my time and thought, \u2018Oh, maybe I won.\u2019 And then superman over here just came flying through,\u201d Danielson said, referring to van Garderen. \u201cBut he\u2019s the best guy in the race, so to be second to him is a real big honor.\u201d\n\nVan Garderen followed two riders later, and Danielson was bumped to second on the stage, still 15 seconds faster than third-place finisher Serghei Tvetcov of Jelly Belly.\n\n\u201cHe was great,\u201d said Jonathan Vaughters, manager of Team Garmin-Sharp. \u201cJust not enough. But still, for a 36-year-old guy, pretty impressive.\u201d\n\nDanielson\u2019s effort relieved him of a heavy burden. His result still wouldn\u2019t have topped van Garderen\u2019s 25:01.94 record from last year, but it nevertheless catapulted him from fourth to second in the overall race standings, 1:32 back from van Garderen heading into Sunday\u2019s final stage from Boulder to Denver.\n\n\u201cI was definitely a little bit insecure,\u201d Danielson said. \u201cI haven\u2019t done a good time trial yet this year. Although I\u2019ve trained a lot the last months on that bike, I got to think back to my last time trial at the Tour of Switzerland, where I finished pretty far back. So it\u2019s nice to get that monkey off my back. Once I got out there, I felt really strong and enjoyed it. And the crowd was just incredible.\u201d\n\nDanielson \u2014 who this month won the Tour of Utah behind support from his team \u2014 appeared the most relaxed he\u2019s been all week, cracking jokes in the post-race news conference.\n\n\u201cThe last 500 meters of the race were absolutely insane. I mean, I thought I was going to crash. I was in so much pain at that moment \u2026 crashing sounded like a good option,\u201d Danielson said. \u201cBecause I saw how far the finish line still was, and was like, \u2018Well, I could stop right now. All this pain could stop this moment. I just gotta hit this guy in the banana suit right here.\u2019\n\n\u201cHe got out of the way, so I had to go the distance.\u201d\n\nIf all goes as expected \u2014 with no one near the overall lead attacking off the front Sunday \u2014 van Garderen will claim his second consecutive Pro Challenge.\n\nHis squad, BMC Racing, which will be riding to protect his lead, is also expected to claim its second straight team title. It holds a 35-second advantage over Tinkoff-Saxo and a 1:15 lead over Garmin-Sharp heading into Sunday.\n\nDaniel Petty: 303-954-1081, dpetty@denverpost.com or twitter.com/danielpetty\n\nUSA Pro Challenge in review\n\nStage 1, Aspen-Snowmass circuit, 61 miles: Two Boulder riders who are friends and training partners finished inches apart to lead the way.
