Turns out that House conservatives want to go so much further.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nLauren French, who formerly owned this space, and Bloomberg\u2019s Billy House both hit at the same theme Wednesday \u2014 that members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus believe Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s plan of using 2016 to lay out an agenda for the future is too timid, and that they want to see the full House act on big-ticket issues this year. Lauren, in fact, writes that \u201cthe group is agitating for tax reform legislation.\u201d And Rep. Raul Labrador specifically mentioned a tax overhaul to Bloomberg as something he wants to see on the House floor. Lauren\u2019s piece: http://politi.co/1P21ki0 Bloomberg: http://bloom.bg/1TUvOk9\n\nRep. Mark Meadows, another Freedom Caucus member, told Morning Tax he\u2019d like floor votes \u201cmaybe not on the comprehensive package, but pieces of that to at least set the stage for what may or may not be different when someone else is at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.\u201d Asked about taking tough votes on matters that are unlikely to become law this year, Meadows said, \"I think it\u2019s important that the House work its will, even though the expectation is that the Senate\u2019s going to move on so few items.\u201d\n\nREMINDERS: Congressional Republicans have been talking about tax reform for more than five years now. But there are good reasons why lawmakers have had trouble translating tax reform principles into tax reform proposals \u2014 it\u2019s hard, and for a variety of reasons, including that a lot of tax breaks are really popular.\n\nAnd while Meadows said he\u2019s not necessarily expecting a vote on a comprehensive tax reform bill, it\u2019s also worth remembering what Republicans thought when they were in a similar spot two years ago. More than a few GOP lawmakers \u2014 rank-and-file ones, too \u2014 found themselves worried when former House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp released his draft tax overhaul early in 2014. Those Republicans feared Camp\u2019s proposal could be a political headache for them that fall, even though it was always unlikely to receive a House vote.\n\nHEY, EVERYONE: IT\u2019S THURSDAY. We don\u2019t want to be melodramatic, but tonight\u2019s GOP debate could have one of the biggest fights about a value-added tax in the U.S.\u2019s 240-year history.\n\nWhile you wait, send us tips, ideas and/or constructive criticism.

Devin Nunes officially released his American Business Competitiveness Act (H.R. 4377) on Wednesday. And you\u2019ve got to give Nunes this: He\u2019s not tinkering at the edges. His \u201ccash flow\u201d plan would put a 25 percent tax on the difference between business income and expenses (minus interest) \u2014 replacing the current 35 percent corporate rate and 39.6 percent rate for pass-through businesses. It would also implement full, immediate expensing, a territorial system and basically get rid of all the other business tax incentives. More, from me, here: http://politico.pro/1SOVTTl\n\nAs the WSJ points out, the GOP orthodoxy on business taxes has moved toward Nunes in recent years. Among presidential candidates, Sen. Marco Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush have similar plans, while Sen. Ted Cruz and Sen. Rand Paul tax business consumption in a different manner \u2014 with a VAT. http://on.wsj.com/1l6LBAd\n\nNunes told reporters on Wednesday that he spoke with Brady about holding hearings on his bill, and that he thought the measure would play a constructive role as Brady tries to pass international tax reform this year. Still, it\u2019s far from certain that Nunes\u2019 radical revamp will catch fire or find broad support \u2014 the California Republican said, for instance, that he didn\u2019t even bother reaching out to Democrats to see if they wanted to become co-sponsors, and proposals like scrapping the interest deduction will certainly spark opposition.\n\nPlus, there are some questions about how Nunes\u2019 bill would fit in with Brady\u2019s efforts. It relies solely on the 25 percent rate and territorial system to prevent base erosion and offshore gaming, while international tax reform frameworks have generally called for tougher protections.\n\nGETTING CHIPPY: If you needed another sign that the Democratic race is tightening, then here you are. Hillary Clinton\u2019s camp has gone on the offensive the past few days about Bernie Sanders\u2019 single-payer health care plan. Pro Health Care\u2019s Nancy Cook has more: \u201cThe Clinton campaign claims that Sanders\u2019 single-payer proposal would cost $15 trillion and amount to a 9 percent tax on middle-class families, though it did not define the threshold for the \u2018middle-class.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs Nancy notes, this specific line of attack has surprised some on the left, who believe it sounds suspiciously like a conservative\u2019s criticism. Brian Fallon, a Clinton spokesman, said that the former secretary of State respects the liberals who want to go single-payer. But he added that the time for debate over the best health care system has passed, and \u201cour task now is to defend the Affordable Care Act.\u201d\n\nSanders said this week that he would release the tax estimate for his plan before the Iowa caucuses, now just 18 days away. The numbers matter because while single-payer would mean higher taxes on a broad swath of taxpayers, it would also lower health care costs for consumers. Nancy\u2019s story: http://politico.pro/1l822fN\n\nGAO SAYS: As Pro Tax\u2019s Katy O\u2019Donnell reports, House Republicans jumped on two new Government Accountability Office reports that said a couple of IRS divisions \u2014 small business and wage and investment \u2014 were using flawed methods for audit selection. http://politico.pro/1Sjs0ew\n\nThey weren\u2019t alone: Grover Norquist\u2019s Americans for Tax Reform published a post titled \u201cIRS May Still Be Targeting Conservative Groups,\u201d a nod to the 2013 tea party controversy that has hamstrung the tax agency for almost three years now.\n\nBut as Katy notes, there\u2019s no smoking gun here \u2014 in other words, GAO said the IRS is at risk for making audit choices for biased reasons, but there was no evidence it's actually done so. (The watchdog came to a similar conclusion about the IRS\u2019s tax exempt division last year.) http://bit.ly/1JgWlFV\n\nThe IRS emphasized similar points in its response: \u201cPolitics play no factor in audit selection. There is nothing in the GAO reports that contradict that statement. GAO did not identify any instances where the selection of a case was considered inappropriate or unfair.\u201d The agency did generally agree with the GAO recommendations, and will seek to implement them.\n\nIF AT FIRST YOU DON\u2019T SUCCEED: Public Citizen filed suit in federal court to get its hands on a memo that Ingersoll-Rand, a former U.S. company that moved its official address first to Bermuda and then to Ireland, sent to the Homeland Security Department to make the case that inverted companies are still eligible for government contracts, despite a 2002 law to the contrary.\n\nBloomberg got the memo from Ingersoll-Rand last year, on the condition that it not publish it and drop its own freedom of information suit with DHS. \u201cThe company argued in part that U.S. trade agreements with foreign governments invalidated the law that would prohibit it from winning federal contracts,\u201d Bloomberg\u2019s Zachary Mider wrote. Top congressional Democrats have fought to make it harder for companies to move their legal address abroad, and to get federal contracts once they do, with little success so far. http://bloom.bg/1H6B5wT\n\nCHAMBER\u2019S TIME OF YEAR: Tom Donohue, the chief executive of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, is expected to cover a wide range of topics \u2014 including taxes and the current presidential race \u2014 in his yearly address on the state of U.S. business today. \u201cThe state of American business in 2016 is filled with uncertainty, risks, and challenges,\u201d Donohue will say, according to excerpts released by the Chamber. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the federal government that concerns the business community. State and local governments are piling new mandates, taxes, and costs onto the backs of the private sector.\u201d\n\nSTATE UPDATE \u2014\n\nAND THE WINNER OF THE POWERBALL JACKPOT IS \u2026 The 44 states that participate in Powerball \u2014 plus whoever hits the magic numbers. The Tax Foundation\u2019s Jared Walczak notes that \u201conly about half of Powerball ticket revenue is returned in the form of prizes.\u201d The rest \u2014 minus administrative costs \u2014 goes to state coffers. \u201cAnd in all likelihood, at least one state is going to win big twice. That\u2019s because lottery winnings are generally taxed as ordinary income at both the federal and state (and, where applicable, local) level.\u201d http://bit.ly/1KdERar\n\nOver at the Rockefeller Institute, Lucy Dadayan and Donald J. Boyd argue that the windfall probably won\u2019t be that big. \u201cEvery bit helps, but net revenues from lottery sales are not big in the scheme of state budgets,\u201d they concluded. \u201cGross lottery sales are substantial \u2014 about $70.2 billion in fiscal year 2014, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries. But net revenues for state budgets after payment of prizes, administrative costs, and other expenses were only around $18.1 billion, or 26 percent of sales.\u201d http://bit.ly/1ZkWbRI\n\nCHRISTIE VETOES FILM TAX CREDIT INCENTIVE PROGRAM: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has vetoed new attempts to reinstate incentives for film production in the state, NJ Advance Media reports. Recently, the Legislature urged the revival of the expired tax credit program, but the governor said in his veto statement that \"the state Legislature had chosen to advance \"an expensive bill that offers a dubious return for the state in the form of jobs and economic impact.\" The state\u2019s program pitched \u201ca 20 percent tax credit on production expenses, but was capped at $10 million annually \u2014 limiting the total funding available to producers each year.\u201d http://bit.ly/1l76co4\n\nLOWER OIL PRICES CAUSING DECLINE IN STATE TAX REVENUE: A review of federal data found that lower crude oil prices are putting a dent in revenues for some of the top producers in the country, UPI reports. Tax revenues from energy have diminished about 50 percent year-on-year for Texas, one of the U.S.\u2019s top oil producers, according to a review of state data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. \u201cNorth Dakota is the No. 2 oil producer in the nation behind Texas and, even though its production volumes were relatively stable in 2015, tax revenues dropped 43 percent to $2 billion as a result of lower crude oil prices. For the first five months of the 2015-2017 budget, revenues were off nearly 9 percent.http://bit.ly/200Tw1V\n\nQUICK LINKS\n\n\u2014 GE\u2019s Boston move has some tax benefits. http://reut.rs/1PcmkMS\n\n\u2014 Sanders says Clinton should be with him on Social Security. http://politico.pro/1nk0xgi\n\n\u2014 Tax season is a hassle for small businesses. http://abcn.ws/1JKxU5R\n\n\u2014 ICYMI: Clinton\u2019s estate tax plan wouldn\u2019t hit some of her own tax planning. http://bloom.bg/1TWCQVA\n\nDID YOU KNOW? In 1954, Gov. Robert Meyner of New Jersey vetoed a bill to have \u201cThe Garden State\u201d added to car license plates, saying, \u201cI do not believe that the average citizen of New Jersey regards his state as more peculiarly identifiable with gardening for farming than any of its other industries or occupations.\u201d (The veto was eventually overridden.)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "Nunes rolls out business tax plan \u2014 Hillary and Bernie heat up", "title": "Conservatives want House tax reform vote", "url": "http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-tax/2016/01/conservatives-want-house-tax-reform-vote-nunes-rolls-out-business-tax-plan-hillary-and-bernie-heat-up-212170", "image": "http://static.politico.com/97/de/e15842c94e928ce8b561e20745a0/whitelogoondots.jpeg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "Nunes rolls out business tax plan \u2014 Hillary and Bernie heat up", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Conservatives want House tax reform voteWith help from Elena Chiriboga, Toby Eckert and Josh GersteinTAKE ME TO VOTE: Here we thought that House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady\u2019s goal of having a committee vote on international tax reform this year was ambitious.\nBut there are good reasons why lawmakers have had trouble translating tax reform principles into tax reform proposals \u2014 it\u2019s hard, and for a variety of reasons, including that a lot of tax breaks are really popular.\nhttp://abcn.ws/1JKxU5R\u2014 ICYMI: Clinton\u2019s estate tax plan wouldn\u2019t hit some of her own tax planning.\nAnd while Meadows said he\u2019s not necessarily expecting a vote on a comprehensive tax reform bill, it\u2019s also worth remembering what Republicans thought when they were in a similar spot two years ago.\nIt would also implement full, immediate expensing, a territorial system and basically get rid of all the other business tax incentives."}
