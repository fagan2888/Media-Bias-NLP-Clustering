Operations of the Hawaii Health Connector are scheduled to discontinue by Sept. 30.\n\n\"Now that it is clear that the state will not provide sufficient support for the Hawaii Health Connector's operations through fiscal year 2016 (ending June 30, 2016), the Connector can no longer operate in a manner that would cause it to incur additional debts or other obligations for which it is unable to pay,\" officials wrote in a report released to the nonprofit's board of directors.\n\nThe exchange, which employs 32 full-time staff, 29 temporary staff and 12 full-time contractors, has been under scrutiny for months for its low enrollment numbers and technical glitches.\n\nHawaii Gov. David Ige told Government Technology in an interview last year (before he was governor) that one of the portal\u2019s problems was the development of redundant projects \u2014 a Medicaid eligibility system that received $24 million in federal funding duplicated much of the functionality found in the ACA portal, he said. Ige\u2019s explanation, however, does not say why after years of development and hundreds of millions of dollars, the portal still doesn\u2019t work properly.\n\nTo date, the portal has signed up 9,217 people, along with 628 employees and dependents, and has raised just $40,350 in user fees, according to Nathan Hokama, the exchange's spokesman.\n\nHawaii signed a bill into law in 1974 requiring employers to subsidize health insurance for their employees, resulting in a relatively low rate of uninsured individuals in the state, a fact that raised controversy early in the project\u2019s development. Many argued that the Affordable Care Act itself was redundant in Hawaii.\n\nHawaii now joins Oregon, which shut down its state-run portal earlier this year, Massachusetts, Maryland, Vermont, New Mexico and Nevada in the list of states that struggled to complete their portals. The net cost of the Affordable Care Act is calculated by some to reach $1.2 trillion by 2025.", "article_metadata": {"contentType": "GT Article", "description": "Hawaii says aloha to its struggling health-care portal.", "pubDate": "2015-05-13", "og": {"image": "http://media2.govtech.com/images/Hawaii-Health-Connector.jpg", "title": "Hawaii Ditches $205 Million Health-Care Portal"}, "wssUrl": "http://www.govtech.com/health", "p": {"domain_verify": "6fde23837116ec868cad5f966cf08656"}, "wss": "Health and Human Services", "authors": "[]", "google-site-verification": "YGeeEDFGk0P1HO8tlyROBmRbQvw1H3jzQqXhn0Q55a8", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "article_summary": "After receiving $205 million in federal funding, Hawaii is giving up on its Affordable Care Act health insurance portal, officials announced May 8.\nThe net cost of the Affordable Care Act is calculated by some to reach $1.2 trillion by 2025.\nOperations of the Hawaii Health Connector are scheduled to discontinue by Sept. 30.\nMany argued that the Affordable Care Act itself was redundant in Hawaii.\nIge\u2019s explanation, however, does not say why after years of development and hundreds of millions of dollars, the portal still doesn\u2019t work properly."}
