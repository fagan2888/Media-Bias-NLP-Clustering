The press conference took place before the Buccaneers\u2019 preseason game against the Washington Redskins, and he has just over a week before his new team opens its season against the Carolina Panthers on Sept. 7.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d Mankins said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a week until the first game. I\u2019m going to try to take it in stride. I\u2019ve got the weekend to try to get down some of the mental part of it and then all next week at practice. I\u2019m sure the guys are going to help me as much as possible, and I\u2019m going to try my best.\u201d\n\nIt likely won\u2019t be an incredibly easy transition for the six-time Pro Bowler, who spent all nine seasons of his career with the Pats. New England let Mankins go after he refused to take a pay cut, as they considered him in, if not close to, a decline.\n\n\u201cI might be in a little decline,\u201d Mankins said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. How many guys that have played 150 games are still on the upswing? I\u2019ve played a lot of games, a lot of snaps. But I feel like I still have something to give this game and give to this team. I\u2019ll try my hardest for them. If it\u2019s not good enough, it\u2019s not. If it is, it is.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "logan mankins, logan mankins buccaneers, logan mankins statistics, logan mankins trade, logan mankins patriots, new england patriots, tampa bay buccaneers, pats, bucs, carolina panthers", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "NESN.com", "description": "Logan Mankins is a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers now, but\u00a0all the guard has ever known is the \u201cPatriot Way.\u201d On Thursday, the Bucs held a press conference for Mankins, who was trad\u2026", "title": "Logan Mankins: \u2018It\u2019s A Sad Day Not To Be With\u2019 New England Patriots", "url": "http://nesn.com/2014/08/logan-mankins-its-a-sad-day-not-to-be-with-new-england-patriots/", "image": {"width": 400, "identifier": "https://nesncom.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/logan-mankins3.jpg", "height": 225}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://nesncom.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/logan-mankins3.jpg?w=240", "site": "@nesn", "card": "summary", "creator": "@NESN"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Sports News | Red Sox, Bruins, Patriots, Celtics", "msvalidate.01": "6ECD4773D1E1E617BCDEBA2BF0E17365", "fb": {"pages": 113970128655335}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "NESN.com", "keywords": "new england patriots, sam galanis, tampa bay buccaneers, top stories,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom", "published_time": "2014-08-29T01:02:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-08-29T01:02:05+00:00"}, "verify-v1": "ivg+oRq8TRzTOeeX2t9XC9s5cJlRiJq5o9JoZXB6e+c=", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://nesn.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/b78db9f8695b57fe74bb269068791bb4?s=16", "description": "Logan Mankins is a member of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers now, but\u00a0all the guard has ever known is the \"Patriot Way.\" On Thursday, the Bucs held a press conference for Mankins, who was traded from New England to Tampa Bay on Tuesday, and ESPN's Pat Yasinskas wrote that he sounded like \"a man still i..."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd86ce\"", "article_summary": "\u201cBut I\u2019ve got new teammates here that I\u2019m looking forward to developing relationships with.\u201dAnd Mankins will have to develop those relationships quickly.\nI\u2019m going to try to take it in stride.\nNew England let Mankins go after he refused to take a pay cut, as they considered him in, if not close to, a decline.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough,\u201d Mankins said.\nI\u2019ve got the weekend to try to get down some of the mental part of it and then all next week at practice."}
