NEW YORK (AP) — The current American president has taken a trip back in time to visit some of the country’s early leaders — now performing on Broadway.

Barack Obama and his daughters caught a Saturday matinee of Lin-Manuel Miranda’s hip-hop musical “Hamilton,” the celebrated show about the nation’s first treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, and the Founding Fathers.

It’s his first time seeing the full show. Miranda first performed material from what he was then calling “The Hamilton Mixtape” for a newly elected Obama in 2009. First lady Michelle Obama caught it in downtown this spring.

The Obamas have been big boosters of Broadway, seeing such shows as “Memphis,” ”Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark,” ”Sister Act,” ”The Trip to Bountiful,” ”Motown the Musical” and “Kinky Boots.”
