As associate director of P&G's PG 0.22 % market research, Mr. Smith had spent three weeks assembling a concise pitch with more than 30 PowerPoint slides.\n\nOn the day of the meeting, CEO A.G. Lafley entered the room, greeted everybody and turned his back to the screen. He then stared intently at Mr. Smith throughout the entire presentation, not once turning to look at a slide.\n\nENLARGE James Yang\n\n\"I felt like maybe I hadn't done a very good job because he wasn't looking at my slides like everyone else,\" says Mr. Smith, who also noticed that the other managers didn't seem very engaged. \"It didn't occur to me until later that he did that because he was more interested in what I had to say than in what my slides looked like.\"\n\nThe experience prompted Mr. Smith to alter his approach. These days, he uses far fewer slides and a lot more anecdotes, turning his presentations into stories his audience can relate to instead of lecturing them on what needs changing. As a result, Mr. Smith says, he's subsequently had much greater success getting his ideas across. In four subsequent presentations to Mr. Lafley and his team, they've followed along more closely, asked more questions and given better feedback, says Mr. Smith.\n\nEven with digital and social-media tools, employees often struggle to convey ideas to each other, to managers and to customers. That's why companies such as FedEx, Kimberly-Clark and Microsoft are teaching executives to tell relatable stories as a way to improve workplace communication.\n\nIt's a tool that's more useful than PowerPoint presentations, say career experts, who note that storytelling can also be used on a day-to-day basis to sell ideas to one person or a hundred. But being an effective storyteller requires preparation.\n\nMove beyond facts and figures, which aren't as memorable as narratives, says Cliff Atkinson, a communications consultant from Kensington, Calif., and author of \"Beyond Bullet Points.\"\n\nMany people in business think raw data is persuasive. But when you're dealing with people from other departments and in different fields who don't understand how you got that data, you can lose them pretty quickly.\n\n\"You have to step back and put yourself into their shoes and take them through the process of understanding,\" says Mr. Atkinson. \"That requires you to distill the most important facts and wrap them in an engaging story.\"\n\nFind ways to connect with your audience on an emotional level, says Mr. Atkinson. Neuroscientists have discovered that most decisions\u2014whether people realize it or not\u2014are informed by emotional responses. Do some legwork to find significant events in your audience's lives or your own that you can base your story on or use to reinforce your points, he says.\n\nThis can include dropping in anecdotes about taking care of a sick family member or a memorable customer story, says Mr. Smith, now a corporate trainer and author of \"Lead With a Story: A Guide to Crafting Business Narratives That Captivate, Convince, and Inspire.\"\n\nMr. Smith's book mentions a story told by a single mother to P&G about the trade-offs that she made to support her children. Her experiences, more than anything else that year, convinced P&G executives to lower their price on shortening.\n\nMr. Atkinson suggests organizing your story into three acts and starting by establishing context. You want to let your audience know who the main characters are, what the background of the story is, and what you'd like to accomplish by telling it, he says. You might open, for example, by describing a department that's consistently failed to meet sales goals.\n\nMove on to how your main character\u2014you or the company\u2014fights to resolve the conflicts that create tension in the story, Mr. Atkinson says. Success may require the main character to make additional capital investments or take on new training. Provide real-world examples and detail that can anchor the narrative, he advises.\n\nThe ending should inspire a call to action, since you are allowing the audience to draw their own conclusions about your story versus just telling them what to do. Don't be afraid to use your own failures in support of your main points, says Mr. Smith.\n\nWhatever you do, don't preface your story with an apology or ask permission to tell it. Be confident that your story has enough relevance to be told and just launch into it, says Mr. Smith. Confidence and authority, he says, help to sell the idea to your audience.\n\n\u2014Email: sjdnishi@gmail.com", "article_metadata": {"article.template": "full", "article.created": "2013-11-10T01:45:00.000Z", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "page.region": "na,us", "page.content.type": "Article", "twitter": {"domain": "wsj.com", "description": "Even in a world of high-tech communications, narratives can be the best way to get a message across.", "title": "To Persuade People, Tell Them a Story", "image": {"src": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AI435_sj10ca_G_20131109204324.jpg", "alt": "Even in a world of high-tech communications, story-telling can be the best way to get a message across.", "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AI435_sj10ca_D_20131109204324.jpg"}, "site": "@WSJ", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702303482504579177651982683162&headline=Even%20in%20a%20world%20of%20high-tech%20communications%2C%20story-telling%20can%20be%20the%20best%20way%20to%20get%20a%20message%20across.&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303482504579177651982683162"}}, "page.site.product": "WSJ", "keywords": "Paul Smith,society,community,work,career planning,general labor issues,personal finance,advice,content types,consumer goods,personal care products,appliances", "news_keywords": "Paul Smith,society,community,work,career planning,general labor issues,personal finance,advice,content types,consumer goods", "article.headline": "Even in a world of high-tech communications, story-telling can be the best way to get a message across.", "cXenseParse": {"candybar": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AI435_sj10ca_E_20131109204324.jpg"}, "poptart": {"image": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AI435_sj10ca_D_20131109204324.jpg"}}, "description": "Even in a world of high-tech communications, narratives can be the best way to get a message across.", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364387007,app-argument=wsj://launch?articleid=SB10001424052702303482504579177651982683162&headline=Even%20in%20a%20world%20of%20high-tech%20communications%2C%20story-telling%20can%20be%20the%20best%20way%20to%20get%20a%20message%20across.&weburl=http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303482504579177651982683162", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "article.page": "Personal Finance", "page.content.format": "responsive", "article.summary": "Even in a world of high-tech communications, narratives can be the best way to get a message across.", "page.site": "wsj", "testkeys": "B", "article.published": "2013-11-10T01:45:00.000Z", "dj.asn": "i-32ad", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "fb": {"app_id": 368513495882}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wsj", "embed_count": 1, "word_count": 770, "internal_link_count": 1, "image_count": 1, "external_link_count": 1}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "page.section": "Article", "language": "en-US", "og": {"site_name": "WSJ", "description": "Even in a world of high-tech communications, narratives can be the best way to get a message across.", "title": "To Persuade People, Tell Them a Story", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303482504579177651982683162", "image": {"width": 553, "identifier": "https://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-AI435_sj10ca_G_20131109204324.jpg", "height": 369}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "author": "Dennis Nishi", "article.access": "free", "page.content.source": "WSJ Online Article", "article.origheadline": "To Persuade People, Tell Them a Story", "article.type": "Sunday Journal", "article.id": "SB10001424052702303482504579177651982683162", "user.exp": "default", "article.updated": "2013-11-10T01:45:00.000Z"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdf838\"", "article_summary": "He then stared intently at Mr. Smith throughout the entire presentation, not once turning to look at a slide.\nBe confident that your story has enough relevance to be told and just launch into it, says Mr. Smith.\nAs a result, Mr. Smith says, he's subsequently had much greater success getting his ideas across.\n\"You have to step back and put yourself into their shoes and take them through the process of understanding,\" says Mr. Atkinson.\nThe experience prompted Mr. Smith to alter his approach."}
