I thought, hey, we\u2019re going to have a safety rally tomorrow! It was just too much, thinking about all the balloons, the cardboard stars covered in tinfoil, the cheesy safety clich\u00e9s on posterboard written in glitter, the managers in silly costumes handing out gift certificates to Walgreens.\n\n\u201cSo I told Sarah I wasn\u2019t going to let that happen,\u201d Anaka said. \u201cNot again. No way.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when she took the butcher\u2019s knife she had been using only moments before to chop vegetables and severed her left index finger, using the countertop as a chopping board.\n\n\u201cI only felt pain for a split second,\u201d Anaka recalled. \u201cIt severed the nerve clean through. I wrapped up my hand in a towel and put the finger on ice right away. Before you know it, I was in shock. It was almost euphoric. Not at all like the last safety rally, when I felt like the pain would never end.\u201d\n\nHer employer\u2019s insurer awarded Anaka $55,000 for the workplace accident, and skilled surgeons successfully reattached the severed finger.\n\nThey said she should be ready to return to work in about 90 days or so \u2026", "article_metadata": {"google-site-verification": "BJRhhAX0-HMwLuYcMtPOB6NAdO7bUX3D7seeI_tQT-Q", "generator": "Woo Framework Version 1.0.8"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd5de0\"", "article_summary": "I thought, hey, we\u2019re going to have a safety rally tomorrow!\nNot at all like the last safety rally, when I felt like the pain would never end.\u201dHer employer\u2019s insurer awarded Anaka $55,000 for the workplace accident, and skilled surgeons successfully reattached the severed finger.\n\u201cWe usually have a cake, too, but it\u2019s always too small for everyone to get a piece,\u201d she said.\nI wrapped up my hand in a towel and put the finger on ice right away.\nThey said she should be ready to return to work in about 90 days or so \u2026"}
