First, remember how Obamacare was supposed to be a gigantic job killer? Well, in the first year of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s full implementation, the U.S. economy as a whole added 3.3 million jobs \u2014 the biggest gain since the 1990s. Second, half a million of those jobs were added in California, which has taken the lead in job creation away from Texas.\n\nWere President Obama\u2019s policies the cause of national job growth? Did Jerry Brown \u2014 the tax-raising, Obamacare-embracing governor of California \u2014 engineer his state\u2019s boom? No, and few liberals would claim otherwise. What we\u2019ve been seeing at both the national and the state level is mainly a natural process of recovery as the economy finally starts to heal from the housing and debt bubbles of the Bush years.\n\nBut recent job growth, nonetheless, has big political implications \u2014 implications so disturbing to many on the right that they are in frantic denial, claiming that the recovery is somehow bogus. Why can\u2019t they handle the good news? The answer actually comes on three levels: Obama Derangement Syndrome, or O.D.S.; Reaganolatry; and the confidence con.\n\nNot much need be said about O.D.S. It is, by now, a fixed idea on the right that this president is both evil and incompetent, that everything touched by the atheist Islamic Marxist Kenyan Democrat \u2014 mostly that last item \u2014 must go terribly wrong. When good news arrives about the budget, or the economy, or Obamacare \u2014 which is, by the way, rapidly reducing the number of uninsured while costing much less than expected \u2014 it must be denied.\n\nAt a deeper level, modern conservative ideology utterly depends on the proposition that conservatives, and only they, possess the secret key to prosperity. As a result, you often have politicians on the right making claims like this one, from Senator Rand Paul: \u201cWhen is the last time in our country we created millions of jobs? It was under Ronald Reagan.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nActually, if creating \u201cmillions of jobs\u201d means adding two million or more jobs in a given year, we\u2019ve done that 13 times since Reagan left office: eight times under Bill Clinton, twice under George W. Bush, and three times, so far, under Barack Obama. But who\u2019s counting?\n\nStill, don\u2019t liberals have similar delusions? Not really. The economy added 23 million jobs under Clinton, compared with 16 million under Reagan, but there\u2019s nothing on the left comparable to the cult of the Blessed Ronald. That\u2019s because liberals don\u2019t need to claim that their policies will produce spectacular growth. All they need to claim is feasibility: that we can do things like, say, guaranteeing health insurance to everyone without killing the economy. Conservatives, on the other hand, want to block such things and, instead, to cut taxes on the rich and slash aid to the less fortunate. So they must claim both that liberal policies are job killers and that being nice to the rich is a magic elixir.\n\nWhich brings us to the last point: the confidence con.\n\nOne enduring puzzle of political economy is why business interests so often oppose policies to fight unemployment. After all, boosting the economy with expansionary monetary and fiscal policy is good for profits as well as wages, yet many wealthy individuals and business leaders demand tight money and austerity instead.\n\nAs a number of observers have pointed out, however, for big businesses to admit that government policies can create jobs would be to devalue one of their favorite political arguments \u2014 the claim that to achieve prosperity politicians must preserve business confidence, among other things, by refraining from any criticism of what businesspeople do.\n\nIn the case of the Obama economy, this kind of thinking led to what I like to call the \u201cMa! He\u2019s looking at me funny!\u201d theory of sluggish recovery. By this I mean the insistence that recovery wasn\u2019t being held back by objective factors like spending cuts and debt overhang, but rather by the corporate elite\u2019s hurt feelings after Mr. Obama suggested that some bankers behaved badly and some executives might be overpaid. Who knew that moguls and tycoons were such sensitive souls? In any case, however, that theory is unsustainable in the face of a recovery that has finally started to deliver big job gains, even if it should have happened sooner.\n\nSo, as I said at the beginning, the fact that we\u2019re now seeing mornings in blue America \u2014 solid job growth both at the national level and in states that have defied the right\u2019s tax-cutting, deregulatory orthodoxy \u2014 is a big problem for conservatives. Although they would never admit it, events have proved their most cherished beliefs wrong.", "article_metadata": {"tone": "opinion", "ptime": 20150327032105, "twitter": {"description": "When good news
