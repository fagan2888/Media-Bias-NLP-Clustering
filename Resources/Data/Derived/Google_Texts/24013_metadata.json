The victory gives Republicans at large momentum going into midterm elections to be held later this year.\n\n\n\nDemocrats recruited a great candidate for the Tampa-area district: Alex Sink, a former Florida chief financial officer who narrowly lost the state\u2019s 2010 gubernatorial race against Republican Rick Scott \u2014 Sink won the district in that contest. Sink also outraised Jolly 3 to 1, or $1.2 million to Jolly\u2019s $400,000, according to fourth quarter Federal Election Commission filings. Outside groups, weighted more Democratic than Republican, spent an astonishing $7 million-plus on television ads, mailings and get-out-the-vote efforts, making the race as expensive as a contested statewide senatorial campaign. Polls had Sink narrowly leading Jolly in the final stretch.\n\nBut the race took on an added dimension as Democrats and Republicans alike labeled it a referendum on the President\u2019s health care overhaul \u2014 and, apparently, Obamacare is really that unpopular.\n\n\u201cDemocrats are in grave, grave danger. Tonight, [House minority leader] Nancy Pelosi\u2019s most prized candidate in the entire country was brought down because of Obamacare, President Obama and the Democrats total mishandling of our economy,\u201d said Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, which works to elect Republicans to the House. \u201cIf a challenger with a $1.5 million cash advantage can\u2019t win in a district President Obama won twice, where can Democrats win?\u201d\n\nPelosi, though, said she still believes Sink\u2019s message will prove true for Democrats in November. Sink was a test case for the Democrats\u2019 2014 women\u2019s economic platform as the party seeks to turn out more female voters who trend Democratic. She also road tested their Obamacare messaging \u2014 Sink\u2019s line at its core was \u201cI support the Affordable Care Act but I also support major fixes.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning of this race, Democrats knew this would be an uphill battle \u2014 in a district represented by a Republican for the last 58 years, in a race where Republicans\u2019 outside allies poured millions into a steady barrage of false attacks,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement. \u201cThough she came up short at the ballot box today, there is no doubt that Alex\u2019s message and passion will continue to serve the best interests of her community.\u201d\n\nAfter Jolly\u2019s victory, Democrats need to win 17 seats in November to take back the House. Jolly will have to run again this fall to win a full term. No word yet on whether Sink will seek a rematch.\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of the organization Daniel Scarpinato is affiliated with. It is the National Republican Congressional Committee, not National Republican Campaign Committee.\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the ratio by which Sink outraised Jolly. It is 3 to 1, not 4 to 1.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Republican David Jolly, a former lobbyist, won a Florida special election after special-interest groups on both sides of the aisle poured money into a campaign that commentators widely viewed as a referendum on President Obama's sweeping health care reform", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Republican David Jolly, a former lobbyist, won a Florida special election after special-interest groups on both sides of the aisle poured money into a campaign that commentators widely viewed as a referendum on President Obama's sweeping health care reform", "title": "Republican Jolly Wins Special Election in Florida", "url": "http://time.com/20846/david-jolly-florida-special-election-congress/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/ap241323840597.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "TIME", "image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/ap241323840597.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Republican David Jolly, a former lobbyist, won a Florida special election after special-interest groups on both sides of the aisle poured money into a campaign that commentators widely viewed as a referendum on President Obama's sweeping health care reform", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Republican Jolly Wins Special Election in Florida"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "13th district, alex sink, congress, david jolly, florida, florida speical election, obamacare, women's economic agenda", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "13th district, alex sink, congress, david jolly, florida, florida speical election, obamacare, women's economic agenda"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7ee7\"", "article_summary": "Sink also outraised Jolly 3 to 1, or $1.2 million to Jolly\u2019s $400,000, according to fourth quarter Federal Election Commission filings.\nThe victory gives Republicans at large momentum going into midterm elections to be held later this year.\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the ratio by which Sink outraised Jolly.\nIt is the National Republican Congressional Committee, not National Republican Campaign Committee.\n\u201cIf a challenger with a $1.5 million cash advantage can\u2019t win in a district President Obama won twice, where can Democrats win?\u201dPelosi, though, said she still believes Sink\u2019s message will prove true for Democrats in November."}
