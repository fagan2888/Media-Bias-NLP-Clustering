The GeriJoy CORE Program is an exciting way for providers to keep their patients from being readmitted to hospitals -- it\u2019s not only effective for clinicians, but also engaging and fun for older adults and families. Past News Releases RSS GeriJoy Joins Aging2.0 Alliance\n\nGeriJoy Announces CARES\u00ae...\n\nFamily Matters In-Home Care...\n\nAs part of a new program option announced today by GeriJoy, the company will leverage its technology-enabled 24/7 companionship and oversight service to help keep older adults out of hospitals, saving hospitals money and earning post-discharge care providers like home care agencies more referrals.\n\nUnder the GeriJoy CORE Program (CORE being an acronym for Clinical Observation, Reporting, and Evaluation), GeriJoy's virtual care companions ask clients specialized questions about their daily behavior, tailored to their clinical risk factors. These observations are analyzed by GeriJoy and reported to clinicians such as a registered nurses or care managers, who use the insight from real-time alerts as well as weekly summaries and trends to better evaluate and mitigate client risk factors for hospital readmission.\n\nThe GeriJoy CORE Program focuses on three primary risk factors for preventable hospital readmissions, which hospitals are penalized for under the Affordable Care Act: heart failure, acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), and pneumonia. For example, propping up the legs of a congestive heart failure patient when sitting is an effective way to reduce risk for further complications, and one of the questions asked by the GeriJoy CORE Program of heart failure patients is, \u201cHave you been propping up your legs when you sit down?\u201d All observations are based on the latest peer-reviewed research and standardized survey instruments.\n\nAdditionally, the program observes client risk factors and status pertaining to two of the most common chronic conditions among seniors: COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder) and depression. GeriJoy suggested that Alzheimer's disease and other dementias may soon be included in the GeriJoy CORE Program, through the regular administration of enjoyable cognitive and memory tests.\n\nThe key to the success of the GeriJoy CORE Program is the GeriJoy Companion, which takes the form of a lovable dog or cat in a specially configured tablet device, available to an elderly person 24/7. Through the support of GeriJoy's remote care staff, the pet talks with older adults intelligently and compassionately about topics including family photos, news, and daily routines to provide companionship, stimulation, and family connection with zero technical abilities required.\n\nUnder the CORE Program, the GeriJoy Companion asks the client questions each day, throughout the day, customized to the client\u2019s clinical risk factors. Clients do not notice any intrusiveness because only a couple of questions are asked at a time, in the comfort of the client\u2019s own home. Moreover, the questions are asked by an unintimidating, adorable virtual companion, blended with regular conversation.\n\nVictor Wang, CEO of GeriJoy, commented that \u201cThe GeriJoy CORE Program is an exciting way for providers to keep their patients from being readmitted to hospitals: it\u2019s not only effective for clinicians, but also engaging and fun for older adults and families.\u201d\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers reports that preventable hospital readmissions cost the U.S. health care system an estimated $25 billion annually. In order to cut down on the number of preventable readmissions, Obamacare's Medicare Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program penalizes hospitals for such readmissions. According to calculations released in 2013 for the first year of the program, the US government charged a total of 2,213 hospitals about $280 million in readmission penalties. In addition to the human cost of a preventable readmission, these new financial penalties mean that hospitals are now more motivated than ever to refer patients post-discharge to care providers that have the best means to prevent readmissions.\n\nFor more information, including GeriJoy CORE Program Specifications, example CORE data/reports, and how to get started as a provider, please contact info(at)gerijoy(dot)com.
