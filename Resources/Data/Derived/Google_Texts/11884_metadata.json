Beshear, the former Democratic governor, announced on Thursday the creation of a nonprofit group, Save Kentucky Healthcare, to marshal opposition to changes being made by Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican who took office in December.\n\nThe effort will begin with online advertising and organizing, Mr. Beshear said, but where it goes from there remains unclear. He declined to say how much money would be behind the campaign, or from what sources.\n\nKentucky, already a test case for the enthusiastic embrace of the Affordable Care Act, now stands to become a test case for attempts to undo it.\n\nA central part of the federal law mandates an online marketplace in each state where people can shop for insurance. If a state refused to build an exchange, as most did, then the federal government created one.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAnother major part of the law allowed states to make Medicaid, the government program for those with a low income, available to far more people, with the federal government paying most of the bill. But the law left it up to each state whether to participate, and 20 have declined.\n\nUnder Mr. Beshear, Kentucky expanded Medicaid and created an online exchange, Kynect, which experts called one of the best in the country. The state also tied the parts together: When people visit Kynect, if they are eligible for Medicaid, the system enrolls them in that program.\n\nSince the exchanges opened, Kentucky has had the steepest decline of any state in the number of uninsured people, and Medicaid enrollment nearly doubled. About 7 percent of Kentuckians younger than 65 were uninsured last year, well below the national average, about 11 percent.\n\nWhile surveys show that Kentuckians view the state\u2019s programs favorably, they elected Mr. Bevin, an ardent opponent of the Affordable Care Act, in November. He has backed away from an earlier vow to undo the Medicaid expansion. Instead, he says, he will try to negotiate changes with federal officials, to pare costs and the number of people eligible.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to have 25 to 30 percent of us on Medicaid,\u201d Mr. Bevin said in an address to the Legislature in late January.\n\nHe has taken steps to dismantle Kynect, saying it will be cheaper to let the federal government run the state\u2019s exchange. \u201cIt will not affect the health insurance of a single individual,\u201d he told the Legislature.\n\nBut Mr. Beshear and others argue that eliminating Kynect will result in more uninsured people, primarily by making it harder to enroll in Medicaid. And they point to studies concluding that expanded coverage is a boon to the state, not a drain.\n\n\u201cGovernor Bevin simply says, \u2018I don\u2019t believe any of this evidence,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Beshear said. \u201cHe says it\u2019s unsustainable based upon some right-wing political ideology.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"tone": "news", "ptime": 20160211065325, "twitter": {"description": "The
