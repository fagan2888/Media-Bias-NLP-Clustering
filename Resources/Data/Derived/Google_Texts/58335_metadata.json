Jerry Moran spent part of Kansas Day in Douglas County on Friday, with a town hall in Eudora as well as a stop at Haskell Indian Nations University.\n\nThe visit to Haskell was partially for a meeting with Stephen Prue, executive assistant to University President Venida Chenault, in preparation for Haskell\u2019s visit to Washington, D.C., next month.\n\nPrue said a group of students and faculty will visit the nation's capital for the American Indian Higher Education Consortium 2016 Winter Meeting from Feb. 8-11.\n\nAnother reason for the visit, Moran said, is to reconnect on the issue of the university\u2019s governance.\n\nChenault told the Journal-World in October that the university is looking at increasing autonomy and authority as a university that is federally funded. The university\u2019s Board of Regents \u2014 which is technically an advisory board rather than a governing body for the school, Chenault said previously \u2014 formally resolved to move toward more autonomy from the federal government, including studying the possibility of becoming federally chartered instead of federally operated.\n\nMoran said Friday that he has spoken with graduates and \u201cthose who are interested in the well-being of Haskell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have indicated that I want to work cooperatively with Haskell to try to get whatever legislation might be useful to them in that autonomy and to increase their chances of having a greater level of private support from across the country,\u201d he said. \u201c(...) We\u2019ve had a long-running conversation over the last several months with Haskell about trying to reduce the bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nAs a senator, Moran said, he has tried to increase his involvement in tribal issues across the country. He is also a member of the Senate\u2019s Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\u201cA significant part of what I\u2019m involved in, in my conversations with tribes but also legislatively, is trying to make sure that the sovereign rights of Native Americans are protected,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like other folks outside Washington, D.C., the tribes see a significant increase in the role the federal government is trying to play in tribal affairs.\u201d\n\nMoran also said that if the issue of autonomy comes to legislation, he will try to persuade his colleagues in the Senate to be supportive, or \u201cknock on the doors\u201d of the Bureau of Indian Affairs if it is an internal issue.\n\n\u201cIf we can work with Haskell to find ways that they are better able to have more flexibility, to raise private funds, to make decisions about what\u2019s in their best interest, I think that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure the commitment of the federal government is kept, but if there\u2019s better ways to deliver the resources and the services, I\u2019m all for that.\u201d\n\nMoran said the Eudora town hall touched on topics such as the role of federal government, the job climate, the Affordable Care Act and what might replace it when a new president is elected \u2014 \u201cnormal conversations that Kansans have.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was my first town hall meeting as a senator in Eudora, and it was pleasing to be thanked for paying some attention to the citizens who live in that part of Douglas County,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a good conversation.\u201d\n\nCopyright 2016 The Lawrence Journal-World.
