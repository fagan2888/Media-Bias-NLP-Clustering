Monday, as the two missed out on a broad market rally and were down more than 1% each.\n\nCanadian-based Valeant\u2019s /quotes/zigman/122461/delayed /quotes/nls/vrx VRX U.S. shares dipped $1.76 to $110.50 in recent action. Allergan /quotes/zigman/217110/delayed /quotes/nls/agn AGN , meanwhile, was off $2.06 to $156.20.\n\nValeant filed notice after the close Friday that it intends to extend its tender offer until Dec. 31. The offer had been due to expire at 5 p.m. on Friday.\n\nValeant has called for a special meeting of Allergan shareholders but it is taking longer than expected, as Allergan requires those who support such a gathering to disclose trading positions. Supporters of the deal are hoping to call the meeting in coming days that could enable them to oust board members and go forward with a merger.\n\nA $53 billion offer for Botox-maker Allergan is on the table from Valeant. Allergan says the proposed price is too low and the company is concerned Valeant would gut its research operations. Allergan recently cut back on research and laid off roughly 13% of its staff in order to help thwart the takeover.\n\nAllergan also has managed to bring regulators into the picture, as the Securities and Exchange Commission is probing whether Valeant and Allergan\u2019s activist investor, William Ackman, profited from insider information as Valeant launched its bid. Ackman and his Pershing Square Capital Management owns 9.7% of Allergan and says the allegations are baseless.\n\nFollow @russbrittmktw\n\nFollow @MWHealthBlog\n\nMore must-read health coverage from MarketWatch:\n\nWill Robin Williams\u2019s death focus more attention on mental health?\n\nInsurers look to hike Obamacare premiums by an average of 8%\n\nHealth-care companies do better than other S&P firms in second quarter", "article_metadata": {"article.created": "2014-08-18T10:44:48-04:00", "application-name": "MarketWatch.com", "twitter": {"domain": "Marketwatch.com", "description": "Valeant Pharmaceuticals extends the deadline on its tender offer for Allergan and its shares tumble.", "title": "Valeant, Allergan shares tumble after deadline extended on merger offer", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/18/valeant-shares-tumble-after-firm-extends-deadline-on-allergan-offer/", "image": {"src": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CP930_allerg_MG_20140811112636.jpg"}, "site": "MarketWatch", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.author": "Russ Britt", "article.section": "Markets", "keywords": "Allergan Inc.,health care,mergers and acquisitions,pharmaceuticals,Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.", "article.headline": "Valeant, Allergan shares tumble after deadline extended on merger offer", "msapplication-task": "name=SmartMoney;action-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/;icon-uri=http://www.smartmoney.com/favicon.ico", "description": "Valeant Pharmaceuticals extends the deadline on its tender offer for Allergan and its shares tumble.", "author": "Russ Britt", "article.page": "Health Exchange Blog", "news_keywords": "Allergan Inc.,health care,mergers and acquisitions,pharmaceuticals,Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.", "article.published": "2014-08-18T10:44:48-04:00", "ROBOTS": "noarchive, noodp", "msapplication-tooltip": "MarketWatch", "fb": {"url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/18/valeant-shares-tumble-after-firm-extends-deadline-on-allergan-offer/", "app_id": 283204329838}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "image_count": 2}, "og": {"site_name": "Marketwatch", "description": "Valeant Pharmaceuticals extends the deadline on its tender offer for Allergan and its shares tumble.", "title": "Valeant, Allergan shares tumble after deadline extended on merger offer", "url": "http://blogs.marketwatch.com/health-exchange/2014/08/18/valeant-shares-tumble-after-firm-extends-deadline-on-allergan-offer/", "image": {"width": 569, "identifier": "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-CP930_allerg_MG_20140811112636.jpg", "height": 398}, "type": "article"}, "article.access": "free", "article.type": "Health Exchange", "article.id": "BL-MW243B-2965", "article.updated": "2014-08-18T12:56:55-04:00"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2252\"", "article_summary": "Valeant filed notice after the close Friday that it intends to extend its tender offer until Dec. 31.\nAllergan says the proposed price is too low and the company is concerned Valeant would gut its research operations.\nA $53 billion offer for Botox-maker Allergan is on the table from Valeant.\nValeant has called for a special meeting of Allergan shareholders but it is taking longer than expected, as Allergan requires those who support such a gathering to disclose trading positions.\nAllergan recently cut back on research and laid off roughly 13% of its staff in order to help thwart the takeover."}
