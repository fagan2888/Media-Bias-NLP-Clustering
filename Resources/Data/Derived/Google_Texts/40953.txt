Organizing for Action, the fundraising and advocacy spinoff of President Barack Obama‘s election campaign, is taking a tea-party symbol and using it to promote one of conservatives’ least-favorite laws: the Affordable Care Act.

OFA has begun mailing a bumper sticker with the slogan “Don’t tread on my Obamacare” and the logo of a coiled stethoscope—in the place of a rattlesnake—to people who have connected with the organization’s Facebook page and provided their mailing address. The initiative, aimed in part at boosting OFA’s mailing list, also appears to be a jab at the tea party, whose members have commonly flown the yellow Gadsden flag—with the slogan “Don’t tread on me”—at their rallies.

The OFA push, part of a larger effort to boost enrollment in the health care exchanges ahead of the March 31 deadline, urges people to “show the world you’re proud of health care reform.”

The flag first originated during the American Revolution, when Col. Christopher Gadsden designed a banner with that logo that the U.S. Navy carried on its first mission. But since tea-party members used the image in their rallies, the two have become inextricably linked.
