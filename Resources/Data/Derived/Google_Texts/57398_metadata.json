A new report suggests that just might be a bad idea.\n\nThat's because the best deals for this year aren't necessarily the best deals for 2016, according to a Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. In almost three-quarters of the counties across more than 30 states that use the federal HealthCare.gov system to apply, the lowest-price \"silver\" insurance plan is a different policy, and maybe even from a different insurer, than it was last year. For a 40-year-old, that could mean the difference between paying 15 percent more and 7 percent more next year, on average.\n\nThe third year of health insurance enrollment on the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act began Nov. 1 and runs until Jan. 31, and there's been a lot of changes in the plans available and their premiums. Across the country, rates on these marketplaces are going up an average 7.5 percent compared to this year. Some insurers instituted huge increases, while others actually reduced their prices.\n\nThe cheapest silver plan is different in 73 percent of counties in HealthCare.gov states than it was for the 2015 sign-up period. The Kaiser Family Foundation looked at these mid-level plans because they're the most popular compared to bronze, gold and platinum plans and the bare-bones \"catastrophic\" plans available to people under 30. Nationally, more than two-thirds of those who signed up for insurance through the federal exchanges or those run by states like California and Colorado selected silver plans during open enrollment for 2015.\n\nHealthCare.gov customers will be automatically renewed into their current plans -- if they are still available -- on Dec. 15, although they can change to other policies until the end of open enrollment.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The numbers show you may avoid big premium hikes by changing insurance.", "sailthru.expire_date": "2015-11-19 03:01:10 -0500", "og": {"site_name": "The Huffington Post", "description": "The numbers show you may avoid big premium hikes by changing insurance.", "title": "If You Like Your Obamacare Plan, You Maybe Shouldn't Keep It", "url": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obamacare-plan-shop-around-renvew_us_564b4971e4b045bf3df0d0d0", "image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/564b4c7b1600002e0026d88c.jpeg?cache=l9oyz8qwx7", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "The numbers show you may avoid big premium hikes by changing insurance.", "creator": "@JeffYoung", "image": {"width": 2000, "identifier": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/564b4c7b1600002e0026d88c.jpeg?cache=l9oyz8qwx7", "height": 1000}, "title": "If You Like Your Obamacare Plan, You Maybe Shouldn't Keep It", "site": "@HuffPostPol", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "sailthru.date": "2015-11-18 03:01:10 -0500", "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_564b4971e4b045bf3df0d0d0", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "The Huffington Post"}}, "taboola.category": "politics", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "keywords": "Health Care,Health Care Reform,Obamacare, obamacare premiums,jeffrey young,Health Insurance,health insurance premiums", "article": {"section": "Politics", "tag": "Health Care,Health Care Reform,Obamacare, obamacare premiums,jeffrey young,Health Insurance,health insurance premiums", "published_time": "2015-11-18 03:01:10 -0500", "modified_time": "2015-11-18 03:01:10 -0500", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/jcydc"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "article_summary": "The cheapest silver plan is different in 73 percent of counties in HealthCare.gov states than it was for the 2015 sign-up period.\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation looked at these mid-level plans because they're the most popular compared to bronze, gold and platinum plans and the bare-bones \"catastrophic\" plans available to people under 30.\nIn almost three-quarters of the counties across more than 30 states that use the federal HealthCare.gov system to apply, the lowest-price \"silver\" insurance plan is a different policy, and maybe even from a different insurer, than it was last year.\nWASHINGTON -- Health insurance consumers who use HealthCare.gov to buy their plans can choose to stick with what they have and let the system automatically renew their coverage for next year.\nThe third year of health insurance enrollment on the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act began Nov. 1 and runs until Jan. 31, and there's been a lot of changes in the plans available and their premiums."}
