He has a 3-10 record and a 5.90 ERA. He was demoted for a second time this season. In five starts since he was recalled in early July, Butler has an 8.28 ERA.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not commanding much,\u201d Colorado manager Walt Weiss said. \u201cHis pitches are either running out of the zone or back up over the plate.\u201d\n\nLogan \u2014 in the second year of a three year, $16.5-million contract \u2014 went back to the DL with recurring left-elbow inflammation. That injury also sidelined him for significant time last season. This move to the DL dates retroactively to Wednesday (Aug. 12).\n\nLogan\u2019s elbow started flaring up a few weeks ago, he said, at the site of where he had bone spurs surgically removed last year.\n\n\u201cWe knew exactly where it was,\u201d he said. \u201cThey convinced me to go to the DL. I fought them.\u201d\n\nLogan \u2014 who has a 4.75 ERA in 48 appearances for the Rockies \u2014 said the team noticed his injury because he wasn\u2019t finishing pitches.\n\n\u201cI was backing up sliders,\u201d Logan said. But the 31-year-old wasn\u2019t blaming his struggles on an injury. \u201cI take all the credit for my numbers this year,\u201d he said.\n\nColorado called up minor-league relievers Gonzalez Germen and Ken Roberts to fill out the 25-man roster.\n\nRight-handed starter David Hale returned to the Rockies\u2019 clubhouse Friday after he went on the DL July 10 with a groin injury.\n\nHale likely will replace Butler in the Rockies rotation on Wednesday at Coors Field, Weiss said.\n\nHale has been with Albuquerque on a rehab assignment.\n\n\u201cIt gave me some time to work on mechanical stuff too,\u201d Hale said.\n\nNick Groke: ngroke@denverpost.com or twitter.com/nickgroke\n\nLooking ahead\n\nPadres\u2019 Andrew Cashner (4-12, 4.09 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Jon Gray (0-0, 2.70), 6:10 p.m. Saturday, ROOT; 850 AM\n\nFresh off his breakout performance against the Mets at Citi Field in New York, Gray has an opportunity to give Rockies fans an encore performance at Coors Field. In the second start of his big-league career, Gray held the Mets to one hit (a solo home run) in six innings. The former University of Oklahoma star struck out five and issued two walks before he was removed from the game because of the Rockies\u2019 strict 75-pitch limit. Cashner, a veteran right-hander, lost to the Philadelphia Phillies in his last start, giving up three runs and eight hits and striking out four in 6 innings. He has a 4.50 ERA in five starts against the Rockies. Second baseman DJ LeMahieu has hit Cashner hard (going 5-for-10, including a double).\n\nSunday: Padres\u2019 Ian Kennedy (7-10, 4.37 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Chris Rusin (3-5, 4.43), 2:10 p.m., ROOT\n\nMonday: Off\n\nTuesday: Nationals\u2019 Jordan Zimmermann (8-8, 3.34) at Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (7-5, 4.75), 6:40 p.m., ROOT\n\nPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "Eddie Butler sent to Triple-A; Rockies put Boone Logan on DL", "title": "Eddie Butler sent to Triple-A; Rockies put Boone Logan on DL", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2015/08/14/eddie-butler-sent-to-triple-a-rockies-put-boone-logan-on-dl/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808__rockiesp1-1.jpg", "height": 435}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20150808__rockiesp1-1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-14T15:30:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-22T09:19:07+00:00"}, "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "The Rockies sent down struggling rookie starter Eddie Butler to Triple-A Albuquerque on Friday and placed hampered left-handed reliever Boone Logan on the disabled list.\nRight-handed starter David Hale returned to the Rockies\u2019 clubhouse Friday after he went on the DL July 10 with a groin injury.\nHale likely will replace Butler in the Rockies rotation on Wednesday at Coors Field, Weiss said.\nButler threw just four innings in a loss at New York against the Mets on Thursday.\nSunday: Padres\u2019 Ian Kennedy (7-10, 4.37 ERA) at Rockies\u2019 Chris Rusin (3-5, 4.43), 2:10 p.m., ROOTMonday: OffTuesday: Nationals\u2019 Jordan Zimmermann (8-8, 3.34) at Rockies\u2019 Jorge De La Rosa (7-5, 4.75), 6:40 p.m., ROOTPatrick Saunders, The Denver Post"}
