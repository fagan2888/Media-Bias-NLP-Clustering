This was the fastest time for a woman over 90. The previous record was just under 10 hours.\n\nBefore the marathon, she told the Charlotte Observer that the only time she feels her age is after running a marathon.\n\n\u201cLots of times, I see young girls coming in and limping, hardly able to move,\u201d she said, \u201cand I think, \u2018Well, that\u2019s pretty good that I don\u2019t feel that bad.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNot only is she 91 years old, Harriette also ran the race as a cancer survivor. She told reporters that she had undergone nine radiation treatments for skin cancer in 11 days, with the last treatment only one month before the race. She wore tights over bandages to cover the skin wounds left by her recent cancer treatment.\n\n\u201cEverybody in my family has died of cancer,\u201d Thompson told TV station WFAE. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of in our genes.\u201d Her brother died from lymphoma in February, according to a report in Runner\u2019s World.\n\nEvery year she runs the marathon to raise money for the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.\n\nWhat are her secrets for maintaining the stamina to complete the marathon?\n\nShe takes yoga and stretching classes and exercises on an elliptical machine, NPR reports. And, in her retirement community, according to the Observer, she\u2019s \u201cone of very few residents who [move] at faster than a strolling pace.\u201d\n\nHarriette is also a former concert pianist. \u201cShe says the discipline of playing has helped her running and that she sometimes keeps pace during a race by replaying pieces in her mind,\u201d NPR reports.\n\n\u201cI usually think of Chopin etudes, the ones that are technically difficult, because usually they\u2019re pretty fast, and it stimulates me to go a little faster, and also helps pass the time,\u201d she told WFAE.\n\nShe plans to run the San Diego marathon again next year, if she\u2019s alive and able to compete, she told reporters.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m still here next year, I think I\u2019ll probably be able to train better and be in better shape,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cIf I\u2019m able, I\u2019ll try again.\u201d\n\nShe and her husband Sydnor live in Charlotte, North Carolina. They just celebrated their 67th wedding anniversary.\n\nSee this report by ABC News:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee More Stories of Inspiring Seniors on HelpingYouCare\u00ae\n\n_____________\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2014 Care-Help LLC, publisher of HelpingYouCare\u00ae.
