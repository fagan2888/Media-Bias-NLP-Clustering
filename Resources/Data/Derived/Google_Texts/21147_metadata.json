In the provision authorizing tax subsidies to make health plans affordable, the Act reads the subsidies will be available for plans \u201cenrolled in through an Exchange\u2026 established by the State.\u201d\n\n27 states \u2014 including Pennsylvania and New Jersey \u2014 did not establish exchanges, opting instead to use the federal exchange.\n\nThe plaintiffs claim that no one in those states should be eligible for subsidies. Antoinette Krauss of the Pennsylvania Health Access Network says that would affect most of the half a million state residents who\u2019ve gotten a health plan.\n\n\u201c81% of them are qualifying for an average tax credit of 230 dollars a month,\u201d she says.\n\nKrauss says re-interpreting the law now could throw the entire health care system into chaos.\n\nFor Joe Lucas, a painter with a heart condition, insurance stabilized both his health and his finances.\n\n\u201cSome people said the affordable care act is injurious or hurting small businesses. It is not,\u201d Lucas says. \u201cIt actually enabled me to go into business for myself because it lowered the cost of me insuring myself by two-thirds.\u201d\n\nLucas continued, saying, \u201cIf I don\u2019t have health insurance, I don\u2019t get my CT scan and I don\u2019t go to my cardiologist and I may not even be here today if not for this.\u201d\n\nA decision is expected in June.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The plaintiffs say that means residents of states like New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- which did not establish their own exchanges -- are not entitled to credits.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"url": "http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2015/03/04/supreme-court-hears-affordable-care-act-tax-credit-suit-wednesday/", "image": {"width": 1500, "secure_url": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/us-supreme-court-16x9.jpg?w=1500", "identifier": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/us-supreme-court-16x9.jpg?w=1500", "height": 845}, "type": "article", "description": "The plaintiffs say that means residents of states like New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- which did not establish their own exchanges -- are not entitled to credits.", "title": "Supreme Court Hears Affordable Care Act Tax Subsidies Suit Wednesday"}, "twitter": {"site": "CBSphilly", "image": "https://cbsphilly.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/us-supreme-court-16x9.jpg?w=1500", "description": "The plaintiffs say that means residents of states like New Jersey and Pennsylvania -- which did not establish their own exchanges -- are not entitled to credits.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Supreme Court Hears Affordable Care Act Tax Subsidies Suit Wednesday"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "News, Sports, Weather, Traffic and Philly's Top Spots", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "application-name": "CBS Philly", "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly", "author": "http://www.facebook.com/cbsphilly"}, "keywords": "affordable care act, kyw newsradio 1060, obamacare, supreme court government, health, heard on, local, news, philadelphia, syndicated local, watch + listen", "google-site-verification": "44caXBf4kjHeKKAT7ZZ89NaCX25utL_yRSa-qGpwIhY", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/40f9fbf792243f0932e0cab4dbd46d10?s=16", "news_keywords": "affordable care act, kyw newsradio 1060, obamacare, supreme court"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcaa67\"", "article_summary": "The suit revolves around four words in the Affordable Care Act.\n\u201cSome people said the affordable care act is injurious or hurting small businesses.\nKrauss says re-interpreting the law now could throw the entire health care system into chaos.\nBy Pat LoebPHILADELPHIA (CBS) \u2014 A suit that could have massive consequences for people who\u2019ve gotten insured through the federal marketplace gets a hearing before the Supreme Court, today.\n\u201c81% of them are qualifying for an average tax credit of 230 dollars a month,\u201d she says."}
