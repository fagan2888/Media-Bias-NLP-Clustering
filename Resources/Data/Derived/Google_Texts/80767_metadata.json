Labrador said rightwing Republicans wanted to make sure every member \u201cfeels valuable\u201d in Congress.\n\nFreedom Caucus leader Jim Jordan, from Ohio, hinted that his group could back Ryan should he agree to take some powers away from the Republican leadership in the House.\n\n\u201cPaul Ryan is a good man,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great communicator, the kind of messenger our party needs and certainly if he gets in the race I think our group would look favorably on him.\u201d\n\nTom Cole of Oklahoma, a senior party figure who earlier in the week derided conservative upstarts for wanting more authority than they had earned, also tried to downplay the internecine intrigue.\n\nThis process, as chaotic as it looks from the outside, it probably has been healthy. A lot of things are being aired Representative Tom Cole\n\n\u201cThis process, as chaotic as it looks from the outside,\u201d he said on CNN, sitting next to Labrador, \u201cit probably has been healthy. A lot of things are being aired that probably needed to be aired.\u201d\n\nManny of Cole\u2019s peers disagree, including Peter King of New York, another establishment stalwart who said earlier this week: \u201cWe can\u2019t go on like this with one small group, a tiny minority, hijack[ing] the party.\u201d\n\nSuch party rifts have been reflected in the Republican presidential race, where candidates with no experience in government, like billionaire Donald Trump and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, have for months dominated the polls over former and current governors and senators.\n\nTrump scorned the party\u2019s disunity, telling CBS in an interview broadcast on Sunday congressional Republicans were \u201cterrible negotiators\u201d. He said that while he disagreed with some of Ryan\u2019s positions, he would be \u201cOK\u201d with him as speaker.\n\n\u201cI think he doesn\u2019t want it very badly, but you never know,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMaybe he\u2019s playing one of the great games of all time.\u201d\n\nThe billionaire insisted that the party needed to fight even harder for its principles and rid itself of leaders who \u201cnever win\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe need toughness,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need fists, we need the brainpower, and we need toughness.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s populist rhetoric has won him the support of enough of the party\u2019s grassroots to buoy him at the top of the polls, even as his inflammatory remarks about immigrants, women and others have exasperated party leaders.\n\nCarson also appeared on CBS on Sunday. He suggested that the party revolt was inevitable, saying: \u201cThe electorate is getting pretty frustrated and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s being reflected in Congress right now.\u201d\n\nSorry, your browser is unable to play this video.
