With male sports fans knowing that they\u2019ll be sitting around the couch for hours on end during the 68-team tournament, doctors are seeing an uptick in the procedure.\n\n\u201cWe do have [in March] typically about 50 percent more vasectomies than in other months,\u201d Dr. Ed Sabanegh, chairman of the Department of Urology at the Cleveland Clinic, toldCNN.\n\n\u201cA lot of patients come in and say, \u2018I have to have this during March Madness, you have to talk to my wife about it. Tell her what my limitations are and that I need to be on the couch,\u2019\u201d Dr. Sabanegh added.\n\nDr. Stephen Jones of the Cleveland Clinic concurred:\n\n\u201cAt least half the guys that I\u2019ve got scheduled for later in the week acknowledge that they are here specifically here for that reason. And in fact the guy this morning said \u2018absolutely, that\u2019s why I\u2019m on the schedule for Friday.\u2019 This was my first consultation with him. But as soon as I asked him about it he was a little sheepish to recognize that\u2019s why he\u2019s off work that day.\u201d\n\nThe American Urological Association does not believe it, saying in a statement to CNN: \u201cThe AUA does not have data showing any link between March Madness and an increase in the number of vasectomies performed.\u201d\n\nRegardless, CNN reported that Dr. Jones was so used to the increased business that he now must plan ahead for it.\n\n\u201cThursday is actually normally a surgery day for me, and when we recognized that it wasn\u2019t going to have the slots available when we started getting the calls I actually blocked part of that day out to add additional slots so we were able to open up some that we wouldn\u2019t have been able to take care of otherwise,\u201d he said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "March Madness is apparently the time favored by Ohio men to take a vasectomy vacation.
