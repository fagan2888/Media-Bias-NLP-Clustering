But in these talent-hungry times, Google seems almost stodgy compared with startups like crowdfunding platform Tilt in San Francisco, where employees after a year on the job get a free plane ticket anywhere in the world. Or real-estate giant Zillow, which offers free overnight shipping of breast milk from nursing moms on business trips to their homes. Or even software behemoth Salesforce, which recently held a \u201cMiracle of Mindfulness Day\u201d where experts in higher consciousness equipped \u201cemployees with mindful tips to help them through their work day.\u201d..Millennials, especially, are getting a ton of \u201cbennies,\u201d thanks in part to all the startups whose mission is to deliver cool perks for other startups. Executives at Blueboard, which helps GoPro and others reward their employees with mind-blowing experiences, are seeing explosive growth as they race to cater to the millennial's every inner-dream...\u201cCompanies are realizing that millennials really care about perks,\u201d says co-founder Kevin Yip. \u201cAnd they're looking for more and more ways to keep employees excited and to keep them from leaving the company for another.\u201d..With its mantra that \u201ccash is quiet\u201d and its belief that employees prefer experiential benefits more than financial ones, Blueboard provides perks for clients like lessons in stand-up comedy or the chance to be James Bond for a day, complete with rented tux, a sky-dive and lessons in making the perfect martini...These days, benefits other than the traditional health care insurance and retirement plans are all over the map. Business management startup Domo gives pregnant employees $2,000 for maternity clothing. Employees at Credit Karma in San Francisco can relax during breaks in the company's jam room, complete with soundproofing, drums, amplifiers and guitars. Other perks are, well, pint-size: millennial stock-trading firm Robinhood has its liquid cheese machine. And Rational Interaction, a digital production studio, offers \u201cBreakfast Sandwich Wednesdays\u201d wherein the perk team \u201cscours Seattle for the best new breakfast sandwich, then brings in enough for the whole team.\u201d..Meg Virick, a business professor at San Jose State University, said the push to offer ever-perkier perks by the corporate world sometimes reflects a larger reality.\u201cCompanies are trying to outdo each other with these perks,\u201d she said, because wages, at least nationally, haven't risen dramatically. \u201cSo these perks are taking up a bigger and bigger chunk of the total compensation offered to employees.\u201d..Part of the attraction to employers, she said, is that \u201cthey're revocable if the company gets into a financially tight spot; you can offer yoga classes one day and stop them tomorrow, which gives the employer much more flexibility in their offerings. You can't do that with wage and salary structures, which are much more difficult to change.\u201d..At the same time, in addition to salary and traditional benefits, more and more companies are offering financial perks specially tailored to young millennials coming to work in a part of the country grappling with soaring rents and home prices. With some new hires carrying huge student debt, the financial picture can seem overwhelming...As Richard Cordray, director of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, put it in a recent report, \u201cSome of the initial research on financial education in the workplace already suggests that a financially capable workforce is more satisfied, more engaged, and more productive for their employers.\u201d..San Francisco-based Sindeo Mortgage helps its 75 employees with \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 low-cost home loans that have deeply discounted fees. Staples is using vampire-themed games to get employees excited about money-management and investing in a 401(k). And a firm outside Seattle called Pacific Market Research provides its employees with financial skills training, including classroom instruction on how to deal with debt collectors...\u201cThere are two types of perks \u2014 one is lifestyle and the other is financial,\u201d said Shashank Sundareshan, 29-year-old CEO of a Silicon Valley startup that offers companies student-debt relief assistance for their employees. \u201cThe idea of a workplace cafeteria with free food is great, but more and more startups are turning to financial perks like tuition reimbursement or even help with a mortgage.\u201d..He says many debt-encumbered young employees end up jumping from company to company, chasing higher salaries just to pay off their mountain of debt. \u201cThat's bad for the employee and for the employer,\u201d said Sundareshan. \u201cFifty-to-seventy percent of new hires out of college aren't thinking about 401(k)s, they're thinking about \u2018How do I pay off my debt?'\u201d..Sundareshan said his company's service, where they act as lender and help refi the employee's student loans with a much better rate, \u201cis exactly the sort of perk that might attract someone to a company, but also keep them there.\u201d..", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Perk Wars are raging across our nation.
