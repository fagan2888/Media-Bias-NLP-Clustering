Literally.\n\nArlyn Anderson had been trying to find the right buyer for her longtime family home \u2014 someone who would preserve it, not demolish it.\n\nShe knew the smallish, old house was a tempting teardown target. \u201cIt was a perfect candidate \u2014 a double lot, five minutes from Uptown,\u201d she said. \u201cI was worried.\u201d\n\nSo she took a vintage sign painted with the house\u2019s name, \u201cPetit Point,\u201d and placed it carefully, in the last room she thought prospective buyers would walk through.\n\nSoon Anderson\u2019s real estate agent told her that a couple was smitten with the home and wanted to buy it. Oh, and they also wondered if they could have the vintage sign.\n\n\u201cI knew right then,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cI\u2019d been asking the universe every day to send the right person. This was a message saying, \u2018We appreciate and value this home.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe living room after the recent makeover.\n\nThe couple, Ross and Lilly Moeding, were enchanted by the farmhouse-style dwelling and its features, which included a rustic stone fireplace, pine-paneled walls and beamed ceilings.\n\n\u201cWe totally fell in love with it,\u201d said Lilly. \u201cYou could just see the potential.\u201d\n\nYes, the house needed work, but Ross, a carpenter with his own business, Cabinetry Refined, was the guy for the job. \u201cI was looking for a project. I wanted something like this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s so much character.\u201d\n\nFor her part, Anderson was happy to hand her home over to someone committed to writing its next chapter. \u201cI\u2019m just really pleased,\u201d she said. \u201cThe house itself is a gem. And it\u2019s a house with a story.\u201d\n\n\u2018This is my house\u2019\n\nThe story began in the late 1920s when Alice and Frank Tisdale built a new home in a then-rural setting in St. Louis Park, just west of the Minikahda Club and east of Bass Lake.\n\nThe house, modeled after an 18th-century Pennsylvania farmhouse, was Alice\u2019s dream home. She had filled a bulging scrapbook with pictures of early Colonial cottages, then hired Minneapolis architect Carl Stravs to design a simple yet richly detailed house with her favorite features.\n\nAlice gave her house a name, Petit Point (a type of needlework), which she had painted on a sign \u2014 the sign that Anderson used to intrigue the Moedings.\n\nAlice\u2019s affection for her home is well-documented; she was a prolific writer who penned journal entries and articles about it, including one published in the American Home magazine. \u201cThis is my house from top to bottom,\u201d she wrote in 1929, in a piece titled \u201cPetit Point: A very small house that brought no end of pleasure.\u201d\n\nOne of the many personal touches that Alice built into her home was a removable hearthstone, intended as a time capsule; when the house was finished, she filled the cavity with a tin box containing a new coin, that day\u2019s newspaper and a list of everyone present.\n\nOver the years, as St. Louis Park was developed, the Tisdales\u2019 home was joined by others in what is now the Minikahda Oaks neighborhood.\n\nIn 1955, Petit Point was sold to Richard and Marjorie LeRoy. Years later, Marjorie made headlines as Marjorie Caldwell, who was charged, then acquitted of conspiring with her then husband, Roger Caldwell, to murder Marjorie\u2019s mother, Duluth heiress Elisabeth Congdon. But in the mid-1950s, Marjorie was a suburban housewife, known to her neighbors for her gracious entertaining, hands-on home-improvement projects \u2014 and a tendency to fib. When the LeRoys moved to a bigger house in Minneapolis, Marjorie gave her maternity clothes to the home\u2019s new owner, Anderson\u2019s mother (who was pregnant with Anderson), and even threw her a baby shower.\n\nDorothy and Jim Anderson raised their four children in Petit Point. Arlyn can still remember the first night she slept, as a young child, in the unusual attic-style bedroom with its peaked ceiling, exposed rafters and wrought-iron cats for door hinges. \u201cIt was just magic,\u201d she recalled.\n\nThe Anderson family treasured the home for more than five decades. But in 2012, with her elderly parents ailing and requiring expensive care, Arlyn decided it was time to sell the house, which had sat largely vacant for several years. She mobilized a group of neighbors, Friends of Petit Point, who planned a history-themed open house in hopes of attracting a preservation-minded buyer.\n\n\u201cTeardowns are on so many people\u2019s minds in the neighborhood,\u201d she said. But a real estate agent advised her to empty the house first, clearing out \u201cyears of accumulated antiques and collectibles \u2026 so people could visualize it for themselves.\u201d At the end of that process, the house went on the market \u2014 and the Moedings became the next owners.\n\n\u2018Intimate and unique\u2019\n\nA vintage sign with the home's name, Petit Point.\n\nThe couple lived in the house \u201cas is\u201d for a year, saving up money for the renovation. \u201cIt was drafty, and the ceiling was leaking,\u201d said Lilly. None of the windows opened, and the house was unbearably hot in summer.\n\nStill the Moedings were charmed by their new home, which Ross described as \u201cvery intimate and so unique.\u201d\n\nWhen they were ready to begin remodeling, Ross\u2019 brother, Jess Moeding of Xpand Inc., served as general contractor.\n\n\u201cI had my brother look at it, so I knew what I was getting myself into,\u201d Ross said. But that didn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t a few surprises.\n\n\u201cIt held a whole number of secrets,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWhen you remodel, you never really know what\u2019s behind the Sheetrock.\u201d\n\nThe house had \u201cvirtually no insulation \u2014 horsehair and straw,\u201d so the Moedings added spray-foam insulation, along with new wiring and new windows. The original rough-plaster walls had straw sticking out of the plaster, Ross noted. \u201cShe [Alice] wanted it to look like old mud. \u2026 but a number of the walls were rotten and had to be reframed.\u201d\n\nAnd although the Moedings loved the original wood paneling, much of that, too, had to be removed. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t save what was there; it was so brittle,\u201d Ross said. He repurposed what he could, and replaced the dining-room paneling with fir wood, just like the original panels, to maintain the home\u2019s character.\n\nRoss used his carpentry skills to add new built-ins, including window seats, storage and even beds.\n\nThe new kitchen, in particular, is a showcase of his work. \u201cThe idea for the kitchen was like an old European kitchen, with everything pieced together,\u201d he said. He crafted black-walnut doors for the refrigerator, freezer and pantry; some cabinets were painted cream; and others were given a distressed, antiqued finish. Countertops of Paonazzo marble, and flooring of vintage terra cotta tile, reclaimed from a French farmhouse, complete the Old World ambience.\n\nAttic playroom\n\nThe Moedings also converted the partial attic into a playroom for their 2-year-old son, Elliott. There was no room to build a staircase so they installed climbing rungs into the wall. Because the attic hadn\u2019t been finished originally, it had to be reinforced. The Moedings added steel I-beams below, in the master bedroom, then \u201cwrapped them in fir, to look old,\u201d Ross said.\n\nInterior designer Marita Simmons helped select period-look finishing touches, including lighting and wallpaper.\n\nOutside, the couple added lanterns with flickering flames, inspired by ones they\u2019d seen in New Orleans. \u201cThey have those gaslights everywhere,\u201d Lilly noted.\n\nRemodeling his own home was both enjoyable and exhausting, Ross said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fun house to work on. But it was incredibly stressful at the same time. I was working all day, then coming home and working at night.\u201d\n\nAnd the project grew beyond the couple\u2019s original plans.\n\n\u201cWe went a little overboard,\u201d Ross said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really regret it. It\u2019s our dream house.\u201d\n\nLike the Andersons before them, the Moedings plan to live in the home for decades.\n\n\u201cThis is not for resale,\u201d Lilly said. \u201cThis is where we\u2019ll stay.\u201d\n\nThe couple still have the vintage \u201cPetit Point\u201d sign, which they plan to display outside. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the history of the house,\u201d Ross said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing what the original owner did. She poured her heart and soul into it. And I put my stamp on it, to bring it into the 21st century.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Star Tribune", "description": "The story began in the late 1920s when Alice and Frank Tisdale built a new home in a then-rural setting in St. Louis Park, just west of the Minikahda Club and east of Bass Lake.", "title": "Simple St. Louis Park house, with a name and back story, begins new chapter", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/a-simple-st-louis-park-house-with-a-name-and-a-back-story-begins-a-new-chapter/321905471/", "image": {"url": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08-962295+31petitpoint062815.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "width": 1200, "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08-962295+31petitpoint062815.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "google-site-verification": "bLXTXkzm4dJ8hcJy1LXawtxXxGP3JhInARj69uCiMiM", "twitter": {"description": "The story began in the late 1920s when Alice and Frank Tisdale built a new home in a then-rural setting in St. Louis Park, just west of the Minikahda Club and east of Bass Lake.", "title": "Simple St. Louis Park house, with a name and back story, begins new chapter", "url": "http://www.startribune.com/a-simple-st-louis-park-house-with-a-name-and-a-back-story-begins-a-new-chapter/321905471/", "image": {"src": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08-962295+31petitpoint062815.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces", "identifier": "http://stmedia.stimg.co/08-962295+31petitpoint062815.jpg?h=560&w=750&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces"}, "site": "@StarTribune", "card": "summary"}, "description": "The story began in the late 1920s when Alice and Frank Tisdale built a new home in a then-rural setting in St. Louis Park, just west of the Minikahda Club and east of Bass Lake."}, "article_summary": "\u201cThis is where we\u2019ll stay.\u201dThe couple still have the vintage \u201cPetit Point\u201d sign, which they plan to display outside.\nGallery: A Pennsylvania farmhouse-style home in St. Louis Park has been restored by new owners Ross and Lilly Moeding.\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the history of the house,\u201d Ross said.\nOh, and they also wondered if they could have the vintage sign.\nShe mobilized a group of neighbors, Friends of Petit Point, who planned a history-themed open house in hopes of attracting a preservation-minded buyer."}
