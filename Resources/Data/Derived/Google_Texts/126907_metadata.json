The company ultimately wants to identify therapeutics that restore balance to an off-kilter community by changing its composition or its effects on the human body.\n\nThe diversity of the human collection of microbial residents\u2014known as the microbiome\u2014became more clear last year when the Human Microbiome Project described the diversity and abundance of microbes living in and on the human body (see \u201cResearchers Catalog Your Microbial Zoo\u201d). For every one human cell in the body, there are an estimated 10 microbial cells. Changes in this microbial zoo have been correlated with many health problems: from gastrointestinal disease to diabetes, obesity, and inflammation.\n\n\u201cThe microbes that live with us have a lot of impact on our health, positive as well as negative,\u201d says Gary Andersen, a microbiologist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a cofounder of Second Genome. \u201cBut it\u2019s been hard figuring out within an individual person what is a positive microbiome or community of organisms,\u201d he says. That\u2019s because from person to person, the structure of the communities varies greatly, he says.\n\nOne reason it has been difficult to profile an individual\u2019s microbiome is that most of these organisms can\u2019t grow in pure cultures of a single species. So Second Genome uses DNA sequencing along with another DNA analysis technology developed by Andersen to identify community members and to look at gene activity in both the bugs and the human body. \u201cWe are really focused on the interaction between the microbiome and the host,\u201d says Second Genome CEO Peter DiLaura. The community of bacteria in our guts interacts with receptors and other targets in our body, he says: \u201cWhen we think about therapeutics, it\u2019s about impacting the interaction that is beneficial for disease.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Startup is using DNA analysis to determine how the trillions of microbes inside the body affect health problems", "title": "Scientists are studying gut bugs to find new treatments", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "Startup is using DNA analysis to determine how the trillions of microbes inside the body affect health problems", "title": "Scientists are studying gut bugs to find new treatments", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2013/09/06/scientists_are_hoping_human_gut_bugs_can_help_treat_disease_newscred/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/shutterstock_123182704-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Startup is using DNA analysis to determine how the trillions of microbes inside the body affect health problems", "title": "Scientists are studying gut bugs to find new treatments", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2013/09/shutterstock_123182704-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Susan Young", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, DNA sequencing, Human Microbiome Project, microbes, MIT Technology Review, Second Genome", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "\u201cWe are really focused on the interaction between the microbiome and the host,\u201d says Second Genome CEO Peter DiLaura.\nTopics: DNA sequencing, Human Microbiome Project, microbes, MIT Technology Review, Second Genome, Technology News, Business NewsBy studying the interactions between our bodies and our microbes, a startup hopes to find new ways of treating disease.\nThe company ultimately wants to identify therapeutics that restore balance to an off-kilter community by changing its composition or its effects on the human body.\nOne company, Second Genome, has turned to DNA analysis and biochemical studies of mixtures of microbes and human cells in culture to better explain things.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s been hard figuring out within an individual person what is a positive microbiome or community of organisms,\u201d he says."}
