AP/Charlie Riedel\n\nOne of the most important\u2014and generally overlooked\u2014results of last week\u2019s midterm election was Republican success in increasing control of state legislatures, putting the GOP in a strong position to block expansion of Obamacare to millions of poor people and to pass more laws that would limit women\u2019s access to abortion, contraception and birth control counseling.\n\n\u201cA Republican wave swept over the states, leaving Democrats at their lowest point in state legislatures in nearly a century,\u201d reported Tim Storey of the National Conference of State Legislators, a nonpartisan group that works with statehouse lawmakers.\n\nBefore the Nov. 4 elections, Republicans controlled 57 legislative chambers in the 50 states. By legislative chambers, I mean the Senate and the House in each statehouse. The election raised the number to 66. Control of one house can be as important as control of both. While running one house, a party also can influence the other. That\u2019s why these Republicans, who tend to be anti-choice and anti-Obamacare, have been able to initiate and pass anti-abortion legislation and prevent access for working class and poor families to the Medicaid program. Making that task even easier, Tuesday\u2019s election greatly increased the number of Republican governors\u2014from 21 to 32, the national legislators conference reported.\n\nThese important lawmakers and governors usually don\u2019t make the national political news unless they\u2019re big shots like New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie, who may run for president. In fact, state politicians don\u2019t get much national attention unless they do something foolish or crooked enough to warrant the kind of ridicule John Oliver recently dished out on his very funny HBO show.\n\nAdvertisement Square, Site wide\n\nThere are too many of these state lawmakers and too few journalists trying to report on their activities. And on Election Day, news flowed from Washington, as it usually does, reported by correspondents who only occasionally venture out into the rest of the country.\n\nYet state lawmakers have tremendous impact on how America lives.\n\nTake the abortion issue. A map produced by NARAL Pro-Choice America (formerly the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League) shows the states it considers anti-choice. They run from North Dakota through Texas and the South. It resembles a map of red-state Republican America. And it pretty much matches the legislators conference\u2019s map of Republican controlled statehouses.\n\nNARAL said governments of 24 such states enacted 52 anti-choice measures in 2013. The website Vox reported, \u201cAfter major Republican victories in 2010, legislatures passed 205 abortion restrictions through 2013\u2014more than the 30 previous years combined.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhat does NARAL mean by anti-choice laws? Among those making the NARAL list are measures banning abortion after 20 weeks; delaying abortions to allow time for an anti-choice lecture and distribution of written material; targeting abortion providers with tough, often punitive, regulation; banning insurance plans from covering abortions; preventing organizations receiving state or federal funds from counseling on abortion; and restricting poor and young women\u2019s access to abortion.\n\nThe Republican legislators and governors also have an opportunity to go after Obamacare. In its ruling on the Affordable Care Act, the Supreme Court left it up to the states to decide whether to expand their Medicaid programs, with most of the costs paid by the federal government. Sarah Kliff of Vox noted that 23 states have not done so. Expansion would bring 4.5 million more people into Obamacare. But, as Vox said, \u201cWith so many Republican victories, particularly in large states like Florida and Texas, it remains very likely that these Medicaid programs will remain unexpanded\u2014and millions of Americans won\u2019t be able to get health insurance as a result.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t doubt there will be more harm coming from the Republican legislatures and governors. You can count on more restrictions on voting, aimed at keeping minority voters\u2014likely Democratic supporters\u2014away from the polls.\n\nAnd then there is the big cache of bills originated by the conservative, business-run American Legislative Exchange Council, known as ALEC.\n\nALEC members include legislators around the country. Its extensive research operation and the rest of its staff are, for the most part, financed by corporations. Relying on ideas from business and its legislator members, ALEC staffers write \u201cmodel\u201d legislation to be introduced in statehouses around the country.\n\nIts best-known effort was the \u201cstand your ground\u201d law, passed by 25 state legislators and used in George Zimmerman\u2019s successful defense when he was accused of the murder of Trayvon Martin.\n\nBut its most important work for its business partners is to write intricate laws that weaken utility, telecom and other regulation in the states. The legislation helps the utilities, telecoms and other companies involved in the rapidly changing communications business. The model legislation is given to lawmakers in statehouses who have been known to read ALEC handouts verbatim when speaking for their bills. ALEC also produces legislation designed to weaken labor unions.\n\nThe harm caused by the powerful Senate and House Republican majorities may be reported, but you can bet the attention of the Washington media will be more on how the debate affects the 2016 presidential election. Policy implications will be discussed in passing, if at all.\n\nMuch of the real harm will go unreported except, hopefully, by the local and regional media. Too many news organizations, however, have reduced or eliminated their statehouse bureaus. Only the victims will know, the young and poor in need of abortion help and the sick deprived of Medicare.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "abortion, bill boyarsky, choice, democrats, election, gop, government, midterm elections, midterm elections 2014, midterms, midterms 2014, obamacare, republicans, senate, state legislature, state legislatures, supreme court", "og": {"site_name": "Truthdig", "description": "One of the most important\u2014and generally overlooked\u2014results of last week\u2019s midterm election was Republican success in increasing control of state legislatures.\n - 2014/11/10", "title": "No One Is Paying Attention to the Real Battle for Power: Bill Boyarsky", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/no_one_is_paying_attention_to_the_real_battle_for_power_20141110", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/AP895673028262360.jpg", "height": 254}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "One of the most important\u2014and generally overlooked\u2014results of last week\u2019s midterm election was Republican success in increasing control of state legislatures.", "creator": "@truthdig", "url": "http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/no_one_is_paying_attention_to_the_real_battle_for_power_20141110/", "image": {"width": 360, "identifier": "http://www.truthdig.com/images/eartothegrounduploads/AP895673028262360.jpg", "height": 254}, "title": "No One Is Paying Attention to the Real Battle for Power | Truthdig: Drilling Beneath the Headlines", "site": "@truthdig"}, "fb": {"app_id": 319814091404244}, "keywords": "Truthdig, No One Is Paying Attention to the Real Battle for Power, abortion, bill boyarsky, choice, democrats, election, gop, government, midterm elections, midterm elections 2014, midterms, midterms 2014, obamacare, republicans, senate, state legislature, state legislatures, supreme court", "article": {"tag": "abortion, bill boyarsky, choice, democrats, election, gop, government, midterm elections, midterm elections 2014, midterms, midterms 2014, obamacare, republicans, senate, state legislature, state legislatures, supreme court", "published_time": "2014-11-10T16:36:01-08:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-10T23:12:03-08:00"}, "description": "One of the most important\u2014and generally overlooked\u2014results of last week\u2019s midterm election was Republican success in increasing control of state legislatures.\n - 2014/11/10"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf428\"", "article_summary": "The Republican legislators and governors also have an opportunity to go after Obamacare.\nMaking that task even easier, Tuesday\u2019s election greatly increased the number of Republican governors\u2014from 21 to 32, the national legislators conference reported.\nA map produced by NARAL Pro-Choice America (formerly the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League) shows the states it considers anti-choice.\nIts best-known effort was the \u201cstand your ground\u201d law, passed by 25 state legislators and used in George Zimmerman\u2019s successful defense when he was accused of the murder of Trayvon Martin.\nBy Bill BoyarskyA full moon rises behind a statue of a Kansas Indian on top of the Kansas Statehouse in Topeka."}
