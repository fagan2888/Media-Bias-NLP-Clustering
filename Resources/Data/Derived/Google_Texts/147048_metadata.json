I heard fans calling \u2018Hollywood!\u2019 and stuff!\u201d\n\nHe added that he had thanked the fans for coming out and also told them, \u201cI put on a show for you all.\u201d\n\nThat he did.\n\nThe sophomore from Mesquite, Texas, set a CSU record, catching four touchdown passes \u2014 three from Garrett Grayson and one from backup Nick Stevens \u2014 as the orange-clad Rams ran their record to 4-1 in front of 25,806 largely orange-clad fans at the annual Ag Day that honors the school\u2019s A&M/Aggie roots and traditions.\n\nCSU coach Jim McElwain, who teases and even rides Higgins at times, noted, \u201cRashard Higgins showed some explosive playmaking ability that we knew he had in him.\u201d\n\nHiggins, with \u201cHollywood\u201d tattooed across his back and a gold streak dyed in his hair, is an intriguing mix of politeness, mischievousness and diva-receiver confidence.\n\nAll three of his touchdown hookups with Grayson, who played after sufficiently recovering from a bruised shoulder suffered at Boston College the previous Saturday, came in the first half as the Rams jumped to a 28-7 halftime lead against the struggling Golden Hurricane (1-4). The touchdown passes covered 28, 31 and 73 yards, and the 36-yarder from Stevens came with 5:02 remaining in the game.\n\n\u201cI give credit to my team, my line, for giving Garrett enough time to throw the ball and find me wide open,\u201d said Higgins, who turns 20 on Tuesday.\n\nHiggins ended up with six receptions for 178 yards, and his fourth catch \u2014 actually, a 3-yard loss \u2014 gave him 100 in his CSU career. He reached that career benchmark faster than any other receiver in school history. Higgins has played 19 games. The previous fastest to 100 was Rashaun Greer, who took 24 games from 2008-09.\n\nIf the meeting with Tulsa seemed potentially a \u201ctrap\u201d game for the heavily favored Rams, they avoided it. Grayson was 12-of-18 passing for 236 yards before giving way to Stevens at the start of the fourth quarter.\n\nAlso, Dee Hart ran for 143 yards and two touchdowns on 11 carries. His usual relief in the one-two punch, Treyous Jarrells, was held out of the game with a sore knee, so Jasen Oden Jr. got more work and had 90 yards on 12 carries.\n\nThe blowout gained a bit of revenge for what was the low point in McElwain\u2019s tenure as the Rams\u2019 coach, a 30-27 loss at Tulsa a year ago.\n\n\u201cThat was a really satisfying win, one that\u2019s kind of been sticking in our craw for a year now, based on what happened a year ago against these guys,\u201d McElwain said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting better as a football team and we\u2019re starting to create an identity for ourselves, and I think that\u2019s important as we establish this program.\u201d\n\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or twitter.com/TFrei\n\nGame balls\n\nJoe Kawulok, CSU, DL: Recorded 3\u00bd sacks for the Rams, who had six as a team.\n\nRashard Higgins, CSU, WR: Became the eighth player in Mountain West history to record four touchdown receptions.\n\nDee Hart, CSU, RB: Rushed for a career-high 143 yards and two touchdowns on only 11 carries.\n\nTerry Frei, The Denver Post", "article_metadata": {"application-name": "thedenverpost", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "The Denver Post", "description": "CSU Rams\u2019 Rashard Higgins has 4 TD catches to lead rout of Tulsa", "title": "CSU Rams\u2019 Rashard Higgins has 4 TD catches to lead rout of Tulsa", "url": "http://www.denverpost.com/2014/10/04/csu-rams-rashard-higgins-has-4-td-catches-to-lead-rout-of-tulsa/", "image": {"width": 654, "identifier": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141004__Rashard-Higginsp1.jpg", "height": 436}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20141004__Rashard-Higginsp1.jpg?w=640", "site": "@denverpost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 6181619439}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://www.denverpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cropped-DP_bug_denverpost.jpg?w=270", "google-site-verification": "2bKNvyyGh6DUlOvH1PYsmKN4KRlb-0ZI7TvFtuKLeAc", "article": {"published_time": "2014-10-04T18:20:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T14:12:41+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Colorado State University"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde424\"", "article_summary": "Rashard Higgins, CSU, WR: Became the eighth player in Mountain West history to record four touchdown receptions.\nIf the meeting with Tulsa seemed potentially a \u201ctrap\u201d game for the heavily favored Rams, they avoided it.\nDee Hart, CSU, RB: Rushed for a career-high 143 yards and two touchdowns on only 11 carries.\nHiggins ended up with six receptions for 178 yards, and his fourth catch \u2014 actually, a 3-yard loss \u2014 gave him 100 in his CSU career.\nThe touchdown passes covered 28, 31 and 73 yards, and the 36-yarder from Stevens came with 5:02 remaining in the game."}
