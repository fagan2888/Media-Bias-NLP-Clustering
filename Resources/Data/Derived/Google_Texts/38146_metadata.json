Guillory\u2019s video crew illustrated this with footage of abandoned homes, loiterers, and cop cars, evidence that life in the hill section was worse than ever.\n\n\u201cMary Landrieu first ran for Senate promising to be a champion for black people,\u201d said Guillory, wearing a three-piece suit, passion flowing into his voice. \u201cWhile you scrounge together food stamps to buy Kool-Aid, she sips champagne at cocktail parties. Let\u2019s send her back home to her father\u2019s house, or to her mansion in D.C., or to wherever the heck she lives.\u201d\n\n\"When I speak to black voters, I sometimes say that we should not put all our eggs in one basket.\" Elbert Guillory\n\nThe spot was memorable, if a little choppy. Guillory had actually debuted this argument a month earlier, at more that twice the length, as a statement and a way to pique donor interest in his Free At Last PAC. It worked. The state senator was a PR natural, a mountain climber who\u2019d rappelled down tall Baton Rouge buildings for charity. With the Landrieu video, he\u2019d outdone himself. Guillory figured he\u2019d cross $1 million in donations by the time the buys started, helped by rapturous coverage on conservative media.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5qbmV8Gktw\n\n\u201cThe Republican pol doesn't mince words,\u201d opined The Weekly Standard.\n\n\u201cIf conservatives embrace the Guillory ad as an early stage in a trial and error process,\u201d offered National Review, \u201cthe ad might be of great historical importance.\u201d\n\n\u201cRepublicans regularly complain that Democrats take the black vote for granted,\u201d wrote the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Jason Riley, \u201cand rightly so, but seldom have I seen this argument made as cogently and eloquently as Mr. Guillory makes it.\u201d\n\nThis was lofty and selfless praise from the author of Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make It Harder for Blacks to Succeed. If Landrieu lost, as polls suggested, conservatives were going to pore over her margins with black voters. They\u2019d tried everything to convince the Democratic Party\u2019s most solid supporters that the party had abandoned them. What if Elbert Guillory had cracked it?\n\nOne day last week, Guillory met me in the parking lot next to the Louisiana governor\u2019s mansion in Baton Rouge, and walked over to the green rocking chairs set up on the porch.\n\nHe dealt with a few messages on his iPhone, then slipped it into one of his lizard-skin cowboy boots, not to disturb him again, as he described the goals of his campaign.\n\nDavid Weigel/Bloomberg\n\n\u201cIf we convert 10 percent of the black vote, I will drink champagne that night,\u201d Guillory said. \u201cMy job is to deliver the message.\u201d\n\nGuillory knew the math, and so did Democrats. To win, Landrieu would need a rollicking black turnout, 95 percent of the vote\u2014as she always got\u2014and a little more than 30 percent of the white vote. Polls had her falling short of that, but if the black vote became just a little less monolithic, she\u2019d have no path to victory whatsoever. No Southern Democrat would.\n\nThe senator had chosen this spot not for the pomp, but because he needed to drop into a meeting of Louisiana\u2019s college Republicans. They strolled by as he talked, leaning down to shake Guillory\u2019s hand, calling him \u201clieutenant governor\u201d\u2014the job he\u2019s running for in 2015. He switched acrobatically between talking to the mostly white future leaders of the GOP and explaining how he, personally, was going to change the pigment of his party.\n\n\u201cWhen I speak to black voters, I sometimes say that we should not put all our eggs in one basket,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I preached a sermon a couple of weeks ago. The subject of my sermon was about not putting all our eggs in one basket! Every breath that I breathe is political. Every prayer that I pray is political.\u201d\n\nRepublicanism came easy to Guillory.\n\n(Democrats, who are dumbfounded at the attention the senator gets, have pointed this out whenever they\u2019ve been able.) Guillory, who turned 70 this year, was born under Dixiecrat rule to parents who voted for Dwight Eisenhower. He\u2019d gone to Baton Rouge\u2019s Southern University and written editorials that attacked segregation. That got him expelled\u2014\u201cI was raised to be my own man\u201d\u2014so he went into the Navy, then colleges up north, and then the Nixon administration\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\n\u201cWhen black voters find out the truth about Barack Obama, they will be up in arms,\u201d said Guillory. \u201cThey will chip his name off the buildings. We should have Richard Nixon\u2019s photograph in our homes, because Richard Nixon breathed life into affirmative action.\u201d\n\nWhenever it was necessary, Guillory registered as a Republican; when he ran for the legislature, in 2006, he ran as a conservative Democrat.\n\n\u201cWe nearly came to blows a few times,\u201d he said of his career in the caucus. \u201cDuring my last year as a Democrat, every Democratic senator here received $80,000 for their campaign.\u201d He raised an index finger. \u201cExcept one. I didn\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nMost Louisiana Democrats maintain that they are not worried about Guillory and his PAC peeling away the black vote\u2014he\u2019s spent too many years as an outlier to have a constituency. Even Guillory\u2019s conversion story is unrelatable, dating to his outrage at a comment that simply doesn\u2019t outrage other black voters. In May 2013, Democratic Sen. Karen Carter Peterson, the chair of the state party, told her colleagues that the failure of Obamacare in the Louisiana legislature was \u201cdown to the race of the president of the United States.\u201d Guillory, who\u2019d actually voted with the losing side and tried to expand Medicaid in the state, was thinking about bailing on his party when his iPhone started to ring.\n\n\u201cMy mother called me up,\u201d recalled Guillory, \u201cand she asked me, \u2018You don\u2019t agree with that, Elbert?\u2019 I did not. I went on the phone and called my registrar right then.\u201d\n\nGuillory\u2019s mother was 103 when she made that call. She lived a little longer to read the news of his coming-out party, at a Baton Rouge conference called \u201c@large,\u201d organized by Republican consultants to bring together black conservatives. The senator arrived onstage in an all-white suit, the kind a character in a \u201cThat\u2019s Entertainment!\u201d musical might wear in a dream sequence about heaven, and explained why he\u2019d left the \u201cparty of disappointment.\u201d\n\n\u201cTheir support of dependency over self-reliance, of everything but traditional marriage, of abortion on demand\u2014their policies have encouraged the high teen birth rate, high unemployment rate, high incarceration rate,\u201d said Guillory. He accused Democrats of pushing for an immigration reform bill without asking about \u201cthe impact of millions of people on our already fragile Social Security system, or our schools, our hospitals, our jobs?\u201d\n\nRepublican legislators filed behind him onstage. Guillory lifted his registration form for the audience to gander at.\n\n\u201cIs it a surprise, or is it the best-kept secret in Louisiana?\u201d he asked. \u201cI am, as of today, joining Frederick Douglass as a Republican.\u201d\n\nHe was on Fox News before the ink was dry. First, the network ran a story about Guillory\u2019s viral video, explaining the switch. Then he was booked for a segment about the president insisting that Martin Luther King would have supported Obamacare.\n\n\u201cTo wrap Obamacare around Martin Luther King is a cheap hijacking,\u201d he said.\n\nDays later came a segment about Harry Reid\u2019s speculation that the president\u2019s race was multiplying his opponents.\n\n\u201cIt just makes a good American sick to hear that kind of humbug,\u201d said Guillory. \u201cSome people have only one card in the whole deck, and it\u2019s the race card.\u201d\n\nMore TV hits followed, and the anti-Landrieu ad brought even more of them, but Guillory wasn\u2019t exactly plugging into black voters by going on Fox News. The cable giant\u2019s audience is reportedly less than 2 percent black.\n\nIn Baton Rouge, Guillory got up from the rocking chair to make his commitment to the College Republicans, who looked a little more diverse than that. He gestured at the state capitol, towering over the rest of the city, down the highway.\n\n\u201cBeing on the inside has always been important to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve never been wedded to a party, I\u2019ve been wedded to service and values. And when those values turn, I\u2019m outta there. There is one black Republican in that building. It\u2019s much easier for me to deliver as a Republican being on the inside.\u201d\n\nHow much did Republicans actually need Guillory? What could he offer them that the party\u2019s other would-be black ambassadors\u2014Herman Cain, Allen West, Michael Steele\u2014tried, and failed, to offer?\n\nA few hours before Guillory spoke in Baton Rouge, I drove to Opelousas. The week prior, Guillory had shown Rep. Bill Cassidy, the GOP\u2019s nominee against Landrieu during a \u201csurprise\u201d visit this month. (The visit had been announced to reporters.) The white, khaki-clad Republicans marched through the site of the TV ad and shook hands at Guillory\u2019s direction.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to come by and kiss us once every six years,\u201d Guillory had told him. \u201cI want you to kiss us all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of my uninsured patients were from neighborhoods such as this,\u201d said Cassidy, whose campaign ads highlight his medical experience\u2014he's a gastroenterologist by training, and co-founded a free dental and health-care clinic for the working uninsured\u2014much more than his three terms in Congress.\n\nRepublicans counted the visit as a clear win, in the enemy\u2019s backyard. The mayor of Opelousas happened to be Donald Cravins, whose namesake son happened to be Landrieu\u2019s chief of staff. Last week, sitting at his desk and with a massive poster of Martin Luther King above him, Cravins, Sr. reported that Cassidy \u201cdidn\u2019t even have the courtesy of picking up the phone, calling the mayor, and saying, \u2018When I\u2019m the senator, we\u2019re going to work together.\u2019\u201d A stunt was a stunt.\n\n\u201cOn a scale of zero to ten, I\u2019d probably give it a minus zero,\u201d said Cravins, who would not let Guillory\u2019s name escape his lips. \u201cI don\u2019t think it had any effect all with black voters. The visit, the video, all of that\u2014I don\u2019t think people even take that particular individual seriously enough for it to make a difference or for it to move the needle at all. I certainly wouldn\u2019t get on television as the elected legislator from an area and try to highlight the fact that it\u2019s one of the most impoverished areas of the state. You want to ask him: What have you been doing for the last eight years besides sitting on your laurels?\u201d\n\nDemocrats had seen this before\u2014recently, many times. The Republican Party was forever promoting black conservatives who could allegedly crack the Louisiana coalition, which wins statewide when the ascendant black Democrats turn out and stay solid. It seldom works.\n\nAfter I talked to Cravins, I drove 15 minutes down the road to Leonville, where Mary Landrieu had come to the small town to cut the ribbon on a bridge built with FEMA grants, which\u2014as city leaders in thick Cajun accents told the assembled\u2014seemed to have fallen out of reach. Landrieu worked the crowd, talking to white and black politicos whom she knew by sight, then gave a short speech about why she needed a new term.\n\nDavid Weigel/Bloomberg\n\n\u201cWe have the chairmanship of the [Energy] committee, which we don\u2019t want to give away,\u201d she said. \u201cYou will also have, as chief of staff, Don Cravins, who is at home here in St. Landry parish. Don Cravins is my chief of staff. I think y\u2019all call him Little Donnie? T-Don? He is the only African-American chief of staff in the entire United States Senate. We\u2019re proud of that. It\u2019s a shame that the Senate is not more diverse in representing people of all different backgrounds.\u201d\n\nAfter the speech, I asked Landrieu if she\u2019d seen Guillory\u2019s ads or worried about the new Republish push.\n\n\u201cOh, what should I say about Elbert Guillory?\u201d asked Landrieu. \u201cThere\u2019s one in every crowd that will promote himself above the people that he\u2019s supposed to serve. You know, he serves black and white, just like I do. But the only person that I know that promotes himself more than Elbert Guillory would be Bobby Jindal, and the two of \u2018em belong in the same boat. I wish he was running against me.\u201d\n\nJindal or Guillory? \u201cEither one! [Guillory\u2019s] message is all about himself. It\u2019s not about the people. And very few people listen to him around here.\u201d\n\nAs night fell in Baton Rouge, Guillory headed into the mansion to deliver a short prayer.\n\nHe was still there, between a throng of college students and a portrait of Gov. Bobby Jindal by the late painter George Rodrigue, when Cassidy made an impromptu appearance and pitch to future leaders. He acknowledged Guillory\u2019s presence, but didn\u2019t talk much about the outreach to Guillory\u2019s own base.\n\n\u201cThe Landrieu strategy is to go to college campuses and get people who otherwise wouldn\u2019t vote and have them turn out,\u201d Cassidy said. \u201cFrankly, your generation doesn\u2019t vote very much. You do. If you can get your colleagues out to vote, we will offset whatever efforts they have done.\u201d\n\nCassidy left, and the College Republicans moved on to leadership elections, as some unaffiliated members meandered over to a table of swag and sweets offered by the Koch network millennial group, Generation Opportunity. Guillory headed outside to finish our conversation, and ran right into one-term Rep. Jeff Landry, a Cajun country politician who had turned around to run for attorney general.\n\n\u201cIf Mary loses, the party\u2019s gonna owe him!\u201d said Landry. \u201cThe message doesn\u2019t have to resonate with all the people out there, just a small percentage.\u201d\n\nGuillory\u2019s message to black voters this year was that they did not need to change at all. Like him, they were natural Republicans. They\u2019d have more clout if they joined a GOP that was coming dominate Louisiana, and they\u2019d no longer be in a coalition with the sorts of progressives who backed gay marriage and abortion-on-demand.\n\nWhat about the rise of Rand Paul? Guillory pumped his fist at the senator\u2019s name. He was showing, almost by himself, that the GOP could toward black voters on criminal justice reform. And Louisiana\u2019s own prison reforms, Guillory pointed out, had been proposed by \u201ca senator by the name of Elbert Guillory.\u201d\n\nThere was no limit to the freedoms that Republicans offered Louisianans\u2014black Louisianans, especially\u2014if they would only get an audience. When I asked Guillory about a decade-old, pre-politics column he wrote about the glories of cockfighting, he launched into a defense of the pastime and an explanation of why cultural snobs wanted to end it.\n\n\u201cThe chickens that end up on dinner tables live in the worst, crowded, filthy conditions,\u201d explained Guillory. \u201cIt would hurt your heart as a human being to see the way they\u2019re maintained. Fighting chickens on the other hand, live the life of Riley. They have the best food, the best accommodations, individual homes. And chickens like to fight. If no one is watching, they\u2019ll fight. I believe that putting little boxing gloves on them, and entertaining people with their pugilistic skills so that human beings can pay their rent, pay for college\u2014that makes sense to me. It\u2019s a completely bloodless sport.\u201d\n\nNight came on, and Guillory posed for pictures with a gaggle of young Republicans, but he really needed to head back to his pickup truck to make his date with \u201ca lovely young lady.\u201d I asked what he\u2019d do if he won the race for lieutenant governor. Was that as far as he planned to go?\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you been listening to me?\u201d he laughed. \u201cMy mother lived to be 104. I may take some sort of emeritus status in politics after I\u2019m 105, but I plan to live until I\u2019m 114,\u201d said Guillory.\n\nHe jerked a thumb at the door of Bobby Jindal\u2019s mansion. \u201cI may end up in there one day.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "If he can win over 10 percent of Senator Mary Landrieu's African-American vote, there's no limit to how far he can go.", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iPY5FU0xioR4/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "og": {"site_name": "Bloomberg.com/politics", "description": "If he can win over 10 percent of Senator Mary Landrieu's African-American vote, there's no limit to how far he can go.", "title": "Elbert Guillory Knows the Math in Louisiana", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2014-10-23/elbert-guillory-knows-the-math-in-louisiana", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iPY5FU0xioR4/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "type": "website"}, "twitter": {"description": "If he can win over 10 percent of Senator Mary Landrieu's African-American vote, there's no limit to how far he can go.", "title": "Elbert Guillory Knows the Math in Louisiana", "url": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2014-10-23/elbert-guillory-knows-the-math-in-louisiana", "image": "https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iPY5FU0xioR4/v1/-1x-1.jpg", "site": "@bpolitics", "card": "summary"}, "fb": {"status": "If he can win over 10 percent of Senator Mary Landrieu's African-American vote, there's no limit to how far he can go."}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "parsely-title": "Elbert Guillory Knows the Math in Louisiana", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "parsely-post-id": "NDWHM66KLVRE01", "parsely-author": "David Weigel", "parsely-section": "politics", "date": "2014-10-23T14:01:18.224Z", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-10-23T14:01:18.224Z", "parsely-tags": "Region: Global,Page: feature", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "parsely-link": "http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2014-10-23/elbert-guillory-knows-the-math-in-louisiana"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fe1abe\"", "article_summary": "And very few people listen to him around here.\u201dAs night fell in Baton Rouge, Guillory headed into the mansion to deliver a short prayer.\nDavid Weigel/Bloomberg\u201cIf we convert 10 percent of the black vote, I will drink champagne that night,\u201d Guillory said.\nThere was State Senator Elbert Guillory, the only black Republican in the legislature, standing in the center of Opelousas.\n\u201cWhen black voters find out the truth about Barack Obama, they will be up in arms,\u201d said Guillory.\n\u201cWhen I speak to black voters, I sometimes say that we should not put all our eggs in one basket,\u201d he said."}
