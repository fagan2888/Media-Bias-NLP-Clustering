Kacinko was walking home from babysitting his nephew. He said he was wearing a backpack with reflective tape. It was snowing, and many roads in the area were snow-covered at the time of the accident around 1:45 a.m.



Police said the impact threw Kacinko 15 feet into a neighbor's yard. His leg was shattered and his head was bleeding, and doctors determined he suffered a concussion. Kacinko had surgery to repair his leg.



Several car parts were found at the crash scene. Police determined that Kacinko was struck by a gold 2000-2002 Pontiac Grand Am. The car had damage to the front end and passenger side and is missing a mirror from the passenger side.



Kacinko remained in the hospital Wednesday evening. His parents ask anyone who sees a car matching the description to call Munhall police at 412-464-7310.
