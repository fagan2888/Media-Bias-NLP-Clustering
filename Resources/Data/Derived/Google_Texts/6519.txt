It was the best of Sarah Palin unscripted, it was the worst of Sarah Palin unscripted.

The Republican Party’s most treasured rabble-rouser was forced to improvise part of her speech at a Tea Party conference in Iowa Saturday after her teleprompter apparently broke in the middle of her delivery.

Palin, who was speaking at the Iowa Freedom Summit, launched into a multitude of brief nonsensical tirades in the moments to follow, causing attendees of the conservative grassroots convention in the early voting state to stop clapping their hands and start scratching their heads.

“'The man can only ride you when your back is bent,” Palin said — one in a series of unusual one-liners she ad libbed after her teleprompter froze. “So strengthen it! Then the man can't ride you, America won't get taken for a ride, because so much is at stake.”

“What will they do to stop causing our pain and start feeling it again” she said in a short rant over Obamacare. “Well, in other words, um — Is Hillary a new Democrat or an old one?”

“Now the press asks, the press asks, ‘Can anyone stop Hillary?’ Again, this is to forego a conclusion, right? It's to scare us off, to convince us that — a pantsuit can crush patriots,” she added.

At another point, she yelled, “Screw the left in Hollywood” — an apparent jab at critics of the movie “American Sniper,” which some liberals have claimed glamorizes war.

The series of bizarre comments came just a day after Palin told The Washington Post that she was “seriously interested” in running for the White House in 2016.

“You can absolutely say that I am seriously interested,” the former vice presidential candidate said Friday.
