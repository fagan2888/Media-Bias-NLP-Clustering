He\u2019s 72, lives in Marietta, Ga., and still works in commercial real estate. He\u2019s a devout Episcopalian who insists we begin our breakfast at the OK Cafe with a prayer. He reads the newspaper every day and clips out the stories he finds interesting. A few years ago, he saw an article in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution about a 15-year-old black kid who had been sent to adult prison for participating in an armed robbery. He started corresponding with the young man, then visited him in prison and led a group to pray for him at St. David\u2019s Episcopal Church. He found this work so rewarding that he began contacting other prisoners he read about, visiting them in prison, helping them where he could; he corresponds regularly with \u201cthree prisoners at a time\u201d in Georgia. There isn\u2019t a dramatic climax to Pete\u2019s prison work. He just does it. His wife Margot is similarly involved, teaching English to Latino adults. \u201cI once knew a guy named Railroad Bob, pretty down and out,\u201d Pete says. \u201cBut he said something I\u2019ll never forget: \u2018We teach best what we desperately need to learn.'\u201d\n\n\n\nI mention Peter and Margot Tennis because they reached out to me when they heard I was going on another of my annual road trips\u2013this time through the South. Pete offered to organize a meeting of his friends and co-workers to talk politics with me in Marietta. That\u2019s how these road trips work; TIME readers provide the itinerary. But a certain sort of TIME reader: Dr. Richard Merwarth, 76, in Pittsboro, N.C.\u2013who organized a meeting for me with 200 or so senior citizens at the Galloway Ridge retirement community\u2013is another. What Pete and Dick have in common is that they are active citizens\u2013not activists, just people who think part of their job as Americans is to be involved in stuff. It\u2019s probably not an accident that they\u2019re both in their 70s: they are among a dwindling but vital minority in the country. They grew up believing that public life, including politics, was a group activity, something you share with your neighbors. That isn\u2019t true anymore. Politics is now a virtual activity. It happens, mostly via ads, on television and the radio. That makes it a lot easier for most people: nothing is expected of them but a vote. \u201cWe just don\u2019t do many events anymore,\u201d a campaign manager in Georgia told me. The candidates\u2019 time is better spent dialing for dollars. That\u2019s nothing new, but gradually politics\u2013and political reporting\u2013has become an arid exercise, the tabulation of money raised and ads promulgated (and invisible phone banks microtargeting voters, which is something journalists can\u2019t quantify). It\u2019s hard to imagine that the Founding Fathers\u2013who staged raucous rallies complete with beer, barbecue and juicy speeches\u2013would recognize the process.\n\nA politically eclectic group gathered in a bland room at the East Cobb, Ga., county offices, 25 people, mostly friends and real estate colleagues of Peter Tennis. They were mostly conservative, though not angry Tea Party sorts. There were a handful of moderate liberals, too, who weren\u2019t as forceful as the conservatives. \u201cPoliticians just want to throw money at things,\u201d said Jeff Marshall, 54, a recent Connecticut transplant. \u201cI\u2019m just not convinced that government can do all that very effectively.\u201d\n\nThis is not an uncommon sentiment, of course. But a small-business owner named Charles Bonds, 41, put some flesh on it, regaling the group with the troubles his company, with 51 employees, was having with the Affordable Care Act. He wanted to provide health coverage and was required to under the law. But his private insurer had raised premiums 57.8%, and while the rates in the local Obamacare exchange were better for his employees individually, the law said that companies with more than 50 employees had to provide the insurance. The obvious answer was to fire two people, hire some temps and subsidize his employees to get their insurance through Obamacare. \u201cAnd even if we did that, the feds require us to report which of our employees haven\u2019t gotten health coverage\u2013which is sort of like snitching on them.\u201d\n\nEric Flamm, 58, a computer consultant, said he thought the whole idea of mandated health care was \u201cflagrantly unconstitutional,\u201d and he was \u201cpessimistic about ever getting the federal government to shrink.\u201d\n\nThe other big issue was a surprising amalgam of immigration and terrorism. Bob Wood, 72, said he was worried that the southern border was porous, that ISIS terrorists were crossing over, that the country was riddled with sleeper cells. \u201cThey\u2019re all over the place,\u201d he said. Several others said they were fearful of ISIS and immigrants\u2013no accident, it turned out, since the Republican candidate for U.S. Senate, a businessman named David Perdue, had just launched an ad accusing his opponent, Michelle Nunn, of supporting \u201camnesty\u201d and an immigration bill that wouldn\u2019t seal the southern border and might allow ISIS terrorists in. (The bill, which was passed with the support of 14 Republican Senators, provides \u201clegal status\u201d but not citizenship for undocumented workers and also would spend an additional $38 billion on increased border security.)\n\nThe Perdue ad is almost hilariously despicable. It also accuses Nunn\u2013the daughter of former Senator Sam Nunn\u2013of \u201cfunding organizations linked to terrorists.\u201d This allegedly occurred while she was the president of George H.W. Bush\u2019s Points of Light Foundation. The real story is TCFP: too complicated for politics. Users of eBay were offered a list of charities to support via Points of Light. In the end, they chose to give $13,500 to a federally approved organization called Islamic Relief USA, which has \u201cties\u201d to an international organization of the same name, which allegedly has \u201cties\u201d to Hamas. Said Neil Bush, the chairman of Points of Light: \u201cTo attack an organization founded by my father \u2026 to smear our organization for political gains, is in my opinion shameful.\u201d (Bush the Elder has endorsed Perdue.)\n\nIn North Carolina, a few days earlier, I attended an actual political rally. It was staged by Republicans in Greensboro and featured their U.S. Senate candidate, Thom Tillis, who wasn\u2019t carrying a pitchfork; and neither did Mark Walker, a local minister running for Congress. \u201cIt\u2019s sad,\u201d Tillis said, \u201cthat we have to be this disappointed in this President.\u201d He criticized his Democratic opponent Kay Hagan\u2013for supporting the Affordable Care Act, diplomacy with Iran, the Senate immigration bill\u2013with a call-and-respond line: \u201cIs that a Senator from North Carolina?\u201d He told his own up-by-his-bootstraps story. (Tillis started on a loading dock and didn\u2019t get his college degree until he turned 36, but he\u2019s been successful in business and is now the speaker of the state legislature.) \u201cI\u2019m optimistic about our country,\u201d he said, running against the right-wing radio trope that the country is in the midst of an Old Testament slide toward damnation.\n\nIt sounded to me, at first, like the Republicans had wised up in 2014. They were serving up smoked brisket, not red meat. There was a rationale for this: white women are likely to be the swing group in the North Carolina and Georgia elections. Women tend not to respond to rhetorical violence. Walker, the minister running for Congress, mentioned neither gay rights nor abortion. It was, I thought, grounds for optimism about the growing climate threat of political overheating. But after I saw the Perdue ad in Georgia, I realized that I\u2013like the lovely folks who set up my road-trip meetings\u2013was living in a community-oriented past, where speeches and rallies meant something. Nowadays, a candidate can be all smiles and more-in-sadness-than-in-anger on the stump, and run ads that are sicker than swamp gas on television, where it really counts.\n\nTO READ JOE\u2019S BLOG POSTS, GO TO time.com/politics\n\nThis appears in the October 06, 2014 issue of TIME.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Nobody wins when voters only experience politics second hand", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"site_name": "TIME.com", "description": "Nobody wins when voters only experience politics second hand", "title": "A Virtual Cycle", "url": "http://time.com/3429646/a-virtual-cycle/", "image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/tom-tillis-joe-klein-road-trip-3.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/tom-tillis-joe-klein-road-trip-3.jpg?quality=75&strip=color&w=1012"}, "description": "Nobody wins when voters only experience politics second hand", "site": "TIME", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "A Virtual Cycle"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-tooltip": "Current & Breaking News | National & World Updates", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://time.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://0.gravatar.com/blavatar/2cee445ea71a179ffd35ea91cf154905?s=16", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f48a8936c3fffc943fce516f2e3ff1d2"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/time2014/img/time-touch_icon_152.png", "application-name": "TIME", "keywords": "elections, in the arena, joe klein, midterms, politics", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/time"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "elections, in the arena, joe klein, midterms, politics"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd9a99\"", "article_summary": "There isn\u2019t a dramatic climax to Pete\u2019s prison work.\nPolitics is now a virtual activity.\nThey grew up believing that public life, including politics, was a group activity, something you share with your neighbors.\nThere was a rationale for this: white women are likely to be the swing group in the North Carolina and Georgia elections.\nPete offered to organize a meeting of his friends and co-workers to talk politics with me in Marietta."}
