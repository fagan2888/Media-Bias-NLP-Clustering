Universal health care has been the top policy goal for decades; if the ACA fails, it will be at least another generation, and most likely more, before Democratic politicians are willing to try again.\n\nAlso\u2026well, actually, there\u2019s not much of an \u201calso.\u201d The ACA\u2019s failure might hurt Democrats in the 2014 midterms and the 2016 elections, but maybe not. Republicans piled one failure after another during George W. Bush\u2019s second term and won a major landslide in 2010. The Jimmy Carter years were brutal for Democrats, but they won big in 1982. Watergate was supposed to destroy Republicans for a generation, but they almost won the White House in 1976. To put it another way: The Reagan recession was a major disaster, but Reagan won big in 1984.\n\nBut then there\u2019s another theory put forth today by Ron Brownstein:\n\nPresident Obama\u2019s health care law is now compounding a political problem it was meant to solve: the generation-long loss of faith in government activism, particularly among the white middle class. For decades, Democratic strategists have viewed universal health care as their best opportunity to reverse the doubt among many voters, especially whites, that government programs can tangibly benefit their families. Now the catastrophic rollout of the health law threatens instead to reinforce those doubts. That outcome could threaten Democratic priorities for years.\n\nFor better or worse, there\u2019s little evidence that public opinion works that way. The best way to convince people of the need for government activism isn\u2019t by enacting programs that work and become popular. If that was the case, liberal successes such as Medicare, Medicaid, the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act would have produced a surge of liberal voters by the late 1970s.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s almost the opposite. While public opinion is mostly stable over time on big-idea questions about ideology, to the extent that there is change it\u2019s pretty simple: Public opinion moves in the opposite direction from incumbents.\n\nSo these Democratic strategists Brownstein cites have it pretty much backward. The best thing that Democrats could do to make public opinion move sharply in a liberal direction would be helping Republicans win lots and lots of elections. It worked during Ronald Reagan\u2019s relatively successful presidency, and it worked during George W. Bush\u2019s disastrous one.\n\nOn the other hand, the relationship between \u201cfaith in government activism\u201d and support for particular programs is iffy at best. The best way to ensure support of a particular program is to enact it successfully. Then it ceases to be part of the debate over activism and becomes instead part of the status quo. And as we\u2019re seeing this month with panic over people losing lousy health insurance, the status quo always has allies in U.S. politics, no matter how bad it seems in the abstract. Moreover, as we\u2019re also seeing this month and will likely see for a long time, it doesn\u2019t take all that long for something new to become the status quo and benefit from how difficult it is to enact change in the U.S. Madisonian system.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to minimize the importance of getting the ACA working. But it\u2019s mostly important because it matters substantively for health case and for the economy, and perhaps secondarily for the next couple rounds of elections. That\u2019s a lot, but that\u2019s about all.", "article_metadata": {"description": "It would destroy liberals' biggest policy goal, but, no, it wouldn't doom liberalism", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "It would destroy liberals' biggest policy goal, but, no, it wouldn't doom liberalism", "title": "The consequences of an Affordable Care Act failure", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/11/15/the-consequences-of-an-affordable-care-act-failure/", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/11/15/the-consequences-of-an-affordable-care-act-failure/", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "Obamacare, ACA,", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "Obamacare, ACA,"}, "article_summary": "No question about it: Total failure of the Affordable Care Act would be a major disaster for liberals.\nWhile public opinion is mostly stable over time on big-idea questions about ideology, to the extent that there is change it\u2019s pretty simple: Public opinion moves in the opposite direction from incumbents.\nThe best way to ensure support of a particular program is to enact it successfully.\nThe best way to convince people of the need for government activism isn\u2019t by enacting programs that work and become popular.\nRepublicans piled one failure after another during George W.
