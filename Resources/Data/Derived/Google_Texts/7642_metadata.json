Health systems should work closely with the national group purchasing organizations for commodities and pharmacy since those products can be contracted at the national level, he said. However, a different strategy should be developed for physician preference items and purchased services, which are contracted at the local level.\n\n\"Two or three years ago, many executives told us their supply chain strategy consisted primarily of working with their national GPO.\" However, today executives recognize the importance of forming a much more comprehensive strategy, which is leading to the formation of a number of regional supply collaboratives and/or regional GPOs to complement those on the national level.\n\n\"Hospitals can't depend on the national GPO for everything,\u201d said May. \u201cThey need a comprehensive strategy to manage the full supply chain.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Suzanne Haggard, CFO at LCMC Health in New Orleans, said she\u2019s been surprised by how much supply chain prices, systemwide, vary for individual hospitals of newly formed systems.\n\n\"What we watch, are working on and devote significant energy to is trying to negotiate system contracts for all of our hospitals in order to take advantage of the buying power hospitals have collectively compared to standalones,\" said Haggard. The institution also is vying to secure the best pricing and standardize its products across its system, she said.\n\n\u201cWe believe we should be able to get the best price for supply chain items,\u201d she said.\n\nSteve Hargett, CFO at MUSC in Charleston, South Carolina, said one complication he wishes he could fix is pharmaceuticals, in which costs seem to be increasing exponentially. \"It's kind of two separate functions,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's all other supply chain functions and then there's pharmaceutical acquisition and distribution. A lot of it involves FDA requirements, but I wish there was a way to bring those two disparate functions together under a single supply chain function.\" Unfortunately, he's yet to figure out how to do so, he said.\n\nLike Healthcare Finance on Facebook\n\nMUSC is making more strategically based decisions on supply chain, Hargett said. For example, about three years ago, the system hired its first chief supply chain officer, who arrived with a lot of experience about other large systems and manufacturers. As a member of the hospital system's administrative team, she's very knowledgeable about the administration of MUSC's service lines, involved in their planning and understands new procedures they're contemplating, he said. \"We didn't focus on that until she came here,\" said Hargett.\n\nShe also oversees the supply chain for the system's physician practices and physician-based outreach clinics and planned surgery centers, he said.\n\nAn emphasis on supply chain strategy is also a major part of the finance strategy at LCMC Health.\n\n\"If I can strategically lower our supply chain costs, this will help to strategically improve our operating income. I'm helping our bottom line,\u201d said Haggard.\n\nTwitter: @HFNewsTweet", "article_metadata": {"og": {"url": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/cfos-say-supply-chain-changes-mean-they-have-act-fast", "image": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/surgical-supplies-feature_3.gif", "site_name": "Healthcare Finance News", "description": "Declines in inpatient volume, reimbursement and changes in the boundary between payers and providers are compelling CFOs across the country to develop new, innovative ways to cut costs.", "title": "CFOs say supply chain changes mean they have to act fast"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "http://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/sites/healthcarefinancenews.com/files/surgical-supplies-feature_3.gif"}, "description": "Declines in inpatient volume, reimbursement and changes in the boundary between payers and providers are compelling CFOs across the country to develop new, innovative ways to cut costs.", "site": "@HC_Finance", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CFOs say supply chain changes mean they have to act fast"}, "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "description": "A number of market forces are making it even more complicated to manage a hospital supply chain today.&#13; Declines in inpatient volume,\u00a0reimbursement and changes in the boundary between payers and providers - not to mention the perpetual cost hikes in supplies and pharmaceuticals - all eat into hospital margins, which affects spending pools.", "viewport": "width=device-width; initial-scale=1.0; maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=no"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fda3f7\"", "article_summary": "Hospital supplies (stock photo)A number of market forces are making it even more complicated to manage a hospital supply chain today.\nAn emphasis on supply chain strategy is also a major part of the finance strategy at LCMC Health.\n\"Two or three years ago, many executives told us their supply chain strategy consisted primarily of working with their national GPO.\"\n\u201cWe believe we should be able to get the best price for supply chain items,\u201d she said.\nOver the past five years, hospitals have become much more strategic in their supply chain decision making, said May."}
