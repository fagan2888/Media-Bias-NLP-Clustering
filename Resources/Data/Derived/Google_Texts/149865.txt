Giving birth is no casual experience. It’s life changing, and often quite painful as well. It’s certainly not an ordeal most women would like to experience without medical support, but Kristin Allred didn’t really get a say when she went into labor in her car last Friday.

“We were really close [to the hospital]; I just felt like I needed to start pushing,” she told ABC News.

Allred’s husband, Shay, had called 911 as soon as his wife began to deliver their daughter, and was met with the voice of William Kalaher, a dispatcher who had begun work only two weeks before. Within a minute from the time he had called 911, Kristin had given birth. She quickly realized there was something wrong with her baby. “I pushed her out and placed her up on my chest and then we realized she wasn’t breathing,” Allred said.

The dispatcher on the phone jumped in. Allred said he kept his cool even when she explained the baby was not breathing because the umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck. “He was great… he was good at helping us focus on what was going on,” she said. “Having him there helped us focus and this is what we really needed to do.”

Kalaher explained to the couple how to position the baby to encourage her to breathe. It worked — the couple now has a healthy baby girl named Anne. Allred says they’re grateful Kalaher was able to help them through the scary delivery.
