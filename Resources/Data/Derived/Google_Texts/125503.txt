Ecuador may rank 65th on The Economist's quality-of-life scale, but it came out tops this year in another indexâ€”a list of the world's best places to retire.

The country scored a 92.7 out of 100 in the annual index from International Living magazine, which focuses on expatriate retirements.

While the Latin American nation got relatively weak scores for healthcare and infrastructure, it also managed perfect scores for climate and for the ease of buying or renting property.
