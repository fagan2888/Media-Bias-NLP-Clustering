And as UH celebrates its 150th anniversary, the system isn\u2019t just reflecting on its last century and a half of service, but rather looking toward the future.\n\n\n\nWith both Broadview Heights and North Ridgeville health centers and freestanding emergency departments set to come online in roughly the next year \u2014 and the construction of a new women\u2019s and children\u2019s facility in urban Cleveland \u2014 UH continues to evolve.\n\n\n\nMuch like hospitals across the country, the UH system looks vastly different than a decade ago. And much of that is due to the vision of UH president and CEO Tom Zenty, who arrived in 2003 from Cedars-Sinai Health System in Los Angeles and envisioned building a truly regional health care system.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the same is our commitment to the highest quality patient care, our commitment to the communities that we serve,\u201d Zenty said in a recent interview with Crain\u2019s. \u201cWe were built on a commitment to support the community. \u2026 (That) remains an important part of who we are today.\u201d\n\n\n\nUH acquired five hospitals in 2014 and 2015, which broadened its reach all the way south to Ashland, helping strengthen UH\u2019s status as a regional system. The five hospital acquisitions helped UH significantly grow its market share from 20% in 2010 to 32% by the end of 2015. Over that same period, the system\u2019s total operating revenue ballooned from about $2 billion to $3.29 billion, or almost half the size of the rivaling Cleveland Clinic.\n\n\n\nHowever, Zenty is quick to note, \u201cWe are not expanding for the sake of growth.\u201d\n\n\n\nDespite the major investments, the system has maintained a healthy profit \u2014 no small feat in today\u2019s challenging health care environment. In 2015, UH posted operating income of $93.6 million on operating revenues of $3.29 billion \u2014 a margin of about 2.84%, which is in line with 2014\u2019s operating margin of 2.88%.\n\n\n\nUH is currently not in the middle of any transactions to integrate more hospitals. Also, with the exception of Lake Health, the immediate market is fully consolidated.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere there are opportunities, we\u2019ll pursue them,\u201d Zenty said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll do it with the same vigilance as we did in the past several years.\u201d\n\nMarket-driven pace\n\nThe system added UH Parma Medical Center and UH Elyria Medical Center to its portfolio in January 2014. Completing two transactions in parallel in one year was \u201cfairly stunning,\u201d said Paul Tait, UH\u2019s chief strategic planning officer said.\n\n\n\nBut the pace continued, driven in large part by the market, as is the case across the nation, Tait said. As smaller hospitals face more and more challenges and financial pressures in the current environment, they\u2019re looking to join systems to find efficiencies or to have a partner to help them respond to the mounting requirements of health care reform.\n\n\n\nShortly after Parma and Elyria, UH announced plans to take over Robinson Memorial Hospital in Portage County. Now known as UH Portage Medical Center, the community hospital was integrated into the UH network in June 2015. Then in November, UH added UH Samaritan Medical Center in Ashland and assumed full ownership of UH St. John Medical Center, which it had co-owned with the Sisters of Charity Health System since 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\n'Super-regional system'\n\n\u201cWe said no to a couple other situations in the last two years also, which again, shows you what the pace is in the market,\u201d Tait said.This market-driven push stands in contrast with the last major string of hospitals UH integrated into its system a couple of decades ago, said Richard W. Pogue, who retired from the UH board of directors this month after 41 years as a member.In the 1990s, a large national hospital group began buying several hospitals in Northeast Ohio, setting off a chain reaction in the market, Pogue said. Though that national group withdrew from the market a few years later, the wave of merger activity it stimulated remained.\u201cToday, it\u2019s a national phenomenon basically caused by Obamacare and rising costs,\u201d said Pogue, who has now been appointed as a lifetime director for the board, but no longer a voting member. \u201cEvery year the government reimbursement seems to go down and the costs keep going up, so it\u2019s just very, very difficult for a small hospital to survive.\u201dThis wave of hospital integration was much more deliberate and, in Pogue\u2019s view, \u201ca tremendous, positive trend.\u201d\u201cFrom my perspective, it\u2019s an expansion of what used to be purely an academic medical center into a regional system,\u201d he said.\n\nBill Ryan, president and CEO of the Center for Health Affairs, which advocates for Northeast Ohio hospitals, assumed the role in the early 2000s within a year of Zenty beginning his tenure.\n\n\n\n\u201cUH, when I first got here, was primarily an academic medical center focused at University Circle,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThey had some affiliation relationships, smaller community hospitals, particularly in the more rural counties, Geauga and Ashtabula, but they were really focused on that main campus. \u2026 Over time, I think part of what Tom saw was the need to have a way to access patients, serve patients across the whole of the region.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn creating a strategy to be a \u201csuper-regional system,\u201d Zenty said the goal was both integrating hospitals as well as expanding services and strengthening the continuum of care. Though the focus of transactions is often on acquiring a hospital, UH also gained the network of physicians, services and outpatient centers associated with each hospital.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re building scale, which is important to reduce cost,\u201d Tait said. \u201cQuite often with transactions, you\u2019re adding new outpatient sites, new physician offices, and it does support where health care\u2019s going in terms of more outpatient care.\u201d\n\nAll-around growth\n\nThough 2014 and 2015 growth came at a historic pace, the past decade overall has brought many new services and facilities to UH. The UH Avon Rehabilitation Hospital opened in January. Its Beachwood rehab hospital opened in 2013.\n\n\n\nThe UH Seidman Cancer Center, the Center for Emergency Medicine and the Breen Breast Health Pavilion at UH Case Medical Center all opened in 2011, the same year UH opened its $298 million Ahuja Medical Center. And in years prior, the Medina, Sharon, Concord, Geneva, Twinsburg and Chesterland health centers have all opened since Zenty came to UH.\n\n\n\nUH\u2019s growth, of course, reaches beyond facilities.\n\n\n\nLast year alone, UH hired almost 300 doctors, many of whom will work in the newly acquired hospitals, help create new programs and serve those communities.\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing forward\n\nUH has passed the $1.4 billion mark on its $1.5 billion capital campaign and aims to meet that goal by the end of the calendar year.Fundraising has grown tenfold in about a decade \u2014 both in dollars raised and in donors contributing. The UH donor base was about 7,000 in 2003. By the end of 2015, that number was more than 70,000. Last year, the system raised $133.5 million in donations, up dramatically from an average of $13.8 million a year between 1993 and 2003.\u201cWe think it\u2019s a testament to the fact that the care that we provide to all of our patients is so widely recognized and appreciated that we have seen our donor base expand dramatically,\u201d Zenty said.Though UH\u2019s service is firmly focused on Northeast Ohio, its research stretches across the country and globe.Since launching in 2012, the Harrington Discovery Institute at UH has funded 60 programs, supporting physician-scientists in the United States and the United Kingdom. UH\u2019s model for health is community-centric, yet it has a worldview from the standpoint of discovery, said Dr. Jonathan Stamler, director of the Harrington Discovery Institute.\u201cFrom the standpoint of discovery, (UH) can\u2019t do that locally. That\u2019s just a reality,\u201d Stamler said. \u201cSo it can\u2019t change standard of care through support solely of discovery in its community. That is not meaningful, unlike the delivery aspect.\u201dThe acquisitions that have enabled UH to provide care to a broader community also supports a strong, sustainable financial base, without which the discoveries and research the Harrington Discovery Institute supports wouldn\u2019t be possible, Stamler said.Institutions tend to only put resources into discoveries that they alone contribute to, he said.\u201cUH is looking at this differently. It\u2019s saying that it wants to contribute in a meaningful way to the treatment of disease for the betterment of mankind,\u201d Stamler said. \u201cAnd so its patients, ultimately in the long run, and its community will benefit by virtue of a national global platform.\u201d\n\nUH has identified and filled a number of the needs and gaps of the newly integrated hospitals, so from a clinical standpoint, the integration is for the most part completed. The challenge for the next three to four years is the non-clinical side of integration and focusing on administrative functions like supply chain management, contracting services, human resources and common accounting practices.\n\n\n\nAnd in particular, information technology, which is a \u201crather expensive and complicated\u201d piece of the puzzle, Zenty said.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll the elements that go along now with making our system as efficient and as effective as we can possibly be will require a lot of our attention in the next year or two,\u201d Zenty said.\n\n\n\nBut also looming in the near future are numerous significant cost increases across the health care industry: annual pharmaceutical cost increases are in the double-digits; supply costs are up 4% or 5%; and wages and salaries increasing at 3% to 3.5%, Zenty said.\n\n\n\n\u201cSo is a 3% margin enough? Well, as you begin to examine what is the rest of the industry passing onto us in terms of increased costs, you begin to see that there\u2019s an emerging pattern that we have to really focus on our efficiency and our effectiveness and as well as our level of profitability,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re very mindful of how we\u2019re seeing increases accelerating rather dramatically across the country.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Over the last decade and the last two years in particular, the health system has grown into a dominant force in Northeast Ohio with big ambitions.
