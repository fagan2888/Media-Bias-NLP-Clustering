Although scientists have been studying placebos for decades, there are still a lot of misconceptions about how they work. Here are the most common.\n\nThe placebo effect is all in the mind: A significant proportion of patients feel better after taking placebos, but many scientists claim this improvement is totally mental. Prominent doctors have called the placebo effect the \u201cbeer goggles of medicine.\u201d\n\nIn reality, placebo treatments can cause measurable, biological changes similar to those triggered by drugs. Studies show that depressed patients on placebos experience increased activity in their prefrontal cortex, which eases their symptoms. In patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, placebos trigger a flood of the neurotransmitter dopamine, just as their drugs do. And taking a placebo painkiller dampens pain-related activity in the brain and spinal cord and causes the release of pain-relieving endorphins.\n\nPlacebos work only if patients think they\u2019re real: Expecting to feel better is a key ingredient in placebo responses. Physicians and researchers have questioned the ethics of placebo use, suggesting that it requires doctors to willfully deceive their patients.\n\nOver the past few years, however, scientists have found this isn\u2019t true. Honest placebos work, too. In one trial, patients with irritable bowel syndrome were told that they were taking a placebo, yet still experienced significant relief. Researchers have found the same effect for depression, migraines and ADHD.\n\nSome research shows that patients learn to associate taking a pill with a particular physiological response, so when they take a placebo, their bodies automatically mimic that response. There\u2019s also evidence that simply being cared for in a trial \u2014 even if patients know a treatment is fake \u2014 helps them feel their conditions will improve.\n\nNeurotic, suggestible people are more likely to respond to placebos: Doctors once took a very patronizing view of placebos. A 1954 article in the Lancet advocated placebos as a means to comfort \u201cunintelligent or inadequate patients.\u201d Recent studies, however, suggest that about a quarter of the variation seems to depend on personality.\n\nIt\u2019s not neurotic people who see benefits, though, but those who are optimistic, altruistic, resilient and straightforward. Scientists think this is because these types tend to be more engaged with their treatment and have more positive expectations. Neurotic and hostile people are least likely to respond.\n\nReal medicines don\u2019t have a placebo effect: It\u2019s true that placebos won\u2019t shrink a tumor, cure an infection or replace insulin in someone with diabetes. But many \u201creal\u201d treatments \u2014 particularly those that modify symptoms like pain, fatigue, nausea or depression \u2014 rely on the placebo effect. Common opioids such as Tramadol are about a third less effective if we don\u2019t know we\u2019re taking them. And in mild to moderate cases of depression, the placebo effect is thought to account for almost all of the benefits of the drugs.\n\nDrugs are always more effective than placebos: A rigorous recent study of 152 trials found that placebo effects are often about the same as drug effects.\n\nOf course, when patients take an active drug, they benefit from both the drug and the placebo effect. But medication can also do harm. For conditions like chronic pain, for which drugs aren\u2019t especially effective, patients can actually do better with alternative therapies.\n\n\u2014 Jo Marchant, The Washington Post", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "http://health.heraldtribune.com/files/2015/03/hfnutribrief31.jpg"}, "wp-parsely_version": "1.8", "fb": {"app_id": 846021808821787}}, "article_summary": "Prominent doctors have called the placebo effect the \u201cbeer goggles of medicine.\u201dIn reality, placebo treatments can cause measurable, biological changes similar to those triggered by drugs.\nBut many \u201creal\u201d treatments \u2014 particularly those that modify symptoms like pain, fatigue, nausea or depression \u2014 rely on the placebo effect.\nA: The \u201cplacebo effect\u201d is a phenomenon in medicine whereby patients feel better without the use of drugs.\nOf course, when patients take an active drug, they benefit from both the drug and the placebo effect.\nThe placebo effect is all in the mind: A significant proportion of patients feel better after taking placebos, but many scientists claim this improvement is totally mental."}
