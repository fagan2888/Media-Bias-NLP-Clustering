Consensus is that the number (which will be revised next month, and then revised again after that) is expected to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 200,000. Of course, it has a margin of error so large that, frankly, it should be regarded as a ballpark estimate at best.\n\nThe BLS number, though, carries a lot of political weight.\n\nSpeaking at Northwestern University yesterday, President Obama essentially bet on a good BLS report, saying, \u201cHere are the facts: when I took office, businesses were laying off 800,000 Americans a month. Today, our businesses are hiring 200,000 Americans a month. The unemployment rate has come down from a high of 10 percent in 2009, to 6.1 percent today. Over the past four and a half years, our businesses have created 10 million new jobs \u2013 the longest uninterrupted stretch of private sector job creation in our history.\u201d\n\nRelated: Why Obama\u2019s on Risky Ground Touting the Economy\n\nIt sounds like a good story. At this rate, the economy adds something like 2.5 million jobs per year, and the millions of unemployed Americans who are still looking for work \u2013 as well as the many who aren\u2019t but could be lured back into the workforce by a strengthening economy \u2013 start to contribute to GDP again.\n\nWhat many people fail to recognize is that while it\u2019s good news to add a couple of hundred thousand jobs per month, it does much less to either the unemployment rate or the labor force participation rate than one might expect.\n\nThat\u2019s because, according to economists like Barry Bosworth, a senior fellow in the Economic Studies Department at the Brookings Institution, the United States needs to add somewhere between 80,000 and 100,000 jobs per month just to keep up with population growth.\n\nRelated: Jobless Receiving Unemployment Insurance at a Record Low\n\nIf you think about the employment rate as a fraction, with the total number of jobs in the economy as the numerator and the number of people in the workforce as the denominator, you\u2019ll understand that under ideal circumstances, every month both of them grow. So adding 200,000 to the top, while a good thing, is offset to a greater or lesser degree by adding as much as half of that to the bottom as well.\n\nTrue, the unemployment rate had dropped to just over 6 percent from a high of 10 percent in 2009, but much of that improvement is illusory \u2013 it\u2019s been people who could be working removing themselves from the denominator.\n\n\u201cUnemployment has gone down, basically, because people are leaving the labor force,\u201d said Bosworth.\n\nWhile job creation has been near 200,000 for most of the year, over the past four and a half years cited by the president, there have been a number of months where the rate of new job creation was not only below the rate of population growth, but was actually negative.\n\nRelated: New Evidence of How Unemployment Wrecks Families\n\nThat\u2019s part of the reason why, despite the addition of 10 million jobs over the past four and a half years, the country still has nearly 10 million people still unemployed.\n\nPart of the president\u2019s job is to be the encourager-in-chief when it comes to economic growth, and nothing he said about jobs growth on Thursday was incorrect. But even he noted Thursday what many millions of Americans are still thinking: \u201cJob growth could be so much faster.\u201d\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Economists expect the Labor Department to report that the economy created 200,000 or more jobs in September, but by all accounts, Americans aren\u2019t feeling as though the economy is back on track.
