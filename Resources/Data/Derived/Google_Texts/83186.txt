HOUSTON - A government contractor in Houston who was supposed to be signing people up for Obamacare stole personal information from at least 17 people around the country.

Kenneth Bacon, who worked in a Houston call center, is accused of taking down the names, dates of birth and Social Security numbers that enrollees gave him. Authorities said some of his victims were elderly.

Harris County financial crimes investigators said Bacon opened multiple credit card accounts using the stolen identities and charged about $8,000 worth of goods and merchandise from Dec. 2013 to April 2015.

A judge set Bacon's bond at $20,000.
