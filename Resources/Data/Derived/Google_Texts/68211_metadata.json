AT&T moved to dismiss on the basis that it is a common carrier subject to the Communications Act and thus exempt from Section 5 of the FTC Act. On March 31, a federal judge in the Northern District of California disagreed with AT&T and denied AT&T\u2019s Motion holding that the common carrier exception applies only when the entity has the status of a common carrier and is engaging in common carriage activity.\n\nThe Court also addressed the impact on the case of the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (\u201cFCC\u2019s\u201d) recent \u201cReclassification Order\u201d that reclassified mobile data service from a non-common carriage service to a common carriage service. The Court noted that the Reclassification Order expressly states that reclassification will \u201capply only on a prospective basis\u201d and when this suit was filed, AT&T\u2019s past alleged mobile data service misconduct was not regulated as common carrier activity by the FCC. The Court rejected AT&T\u2019s argument that once the Reclassification Order goes into effect, the FTC will no longer have jurisdiction to pursue the case even if limited to AT&T\u2019s past conduct. The Order stated that \u201ceven if the change to the common carrier exception, resulting from the Reclassification Order, could be deemed a change in tribunal (i.e., because enforcement with respect to mobile data would be delegated to the [FCC] instead of the FTC and this Court would have jurisdiction only in the former instance), the fact remains that substantive rights are affected by that change as well.\u201d Substantive rights are impaired, according to the Court and the FTC, because the FCC is not authorized to seek refunds for injured consumers and has a shorter one year statute of limitations. Thus, the Court reasoned that the reclassification\u2019s effect on substantive rights undermined AT&T\u2019s argument that the reclassification should be applied retroactively to divest the FTC of jurisdiction over past conduct.\n\nAs a result of the Court\u2019s ruling, the FTC\u2019s case against AT&T will proceed on the merits. FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez reportedly expressed that the FTC was \u201cgratified\u201d by the Court\u2019s holding and \u201clook[s] forward to proving that AT&T\u2019s marketing of its \u2018unlimited\u2019 data plans was unfair and deceptive and returning money to the millions of consumers who were harmed by AT&T\u2019s action.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "No. Dist. of California disagreed denied ATT\u2019s Motion holding that common carrier exception applies only when entity has status and engages in common carriage activity", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"site_name": "The National Law Review", "description": "As we previously reported, in January AT&amp;T filed a Motion to Dismiss the Federal Trade Commission&amp;rsquo;s (FTC&amp;rsquo;s) complaint alleging that AT&amp;T engaged in unfair and deceptive conduct in", "title": "AT&amp;T Court Narrowly Interprets FTC Common Carrier Exception and Permits Throttling Case To Go Forward", "url": "http://www.natlawreview.com/article/att-court-narrowly-interprets-ftc-common-carrier-exception-and-permits-throttling-ca", "image": "http://www.natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/article/aux/1123/cell%20phone%20in%20hand_7.jpg?itok=i-k6YzU6", "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Legal, Business, California, Technology, At&t, Motion to Dismiss, Reclassification Order, Common Carrier, Mobile Communication,", "msvalidate.01": "5493B547C0AB527FF4CF8C4D0127302A", "google-site-verification": "SAKcOmA6_i0E79oG2TjlPWfOSs9kMM6EWAZNaT0aBtA", "verify-v1": "nSkrvEqyOIUMGKMak3OBIKcpcABac4XWK5NJKMuMtBY=", "y_key": "fe6cd8bd83ff0c09", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "Legal, Business, California, Technology, At&t, Motion to Dismiss, Reclassification Order, Common Carrier, Mobile Communication,"}, "article_summary": "AT&T moved to dismiss on the basis that it is a common carrier subject to the Communications Act and thus exempt from Section 5 of the FTC Act.\nOn March 31, a federal judge in the Northern District of California disagreed with AT&T and denied AT&T\u2019s Motion holding that the common carrier exception applies only when the entity has the status of a common carrier and is engaging in common carriage activity.\nThe Court rejected AT&T\u2019s argument that once the Reclassification Order goes into effect, the FTC will no longer have jurisdiction to pursue the case even if limited to AT&T\u2019s past conduct.\nThe Court also addressed the impact on the case of the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (\u201cFCC\u2019s\u201d) recent \u201cReclassification Order\u201d that reclassified mobile data service from a non-common carriage service to a common carriage service.\nAs a result of the Court\u2019s ruling, the FTC\u2019s case against AT&T will proceed on the merits."}
