Sorry, but no.\n\nOn Tuesday, two separate federal courts handed down contradictory rulings that virtually guarantee the endlessly contested health care law will face yet another big test in the U.S. Supreme Court. And no matter how the judicial branch finally rules, the legislative branch will probably have to reopen the law anyway, thanks to a problem highlighted in the cases: the Affordable Care Act\u2019s little-known \u201cterritory problem.\u201d Happy times.\n\nThe stakes are high. Both suits challenge the legality of federal subsidies to people in Obamacare exchanges in the 36 states where the federal government has set up an exhange because the state government declined to do so. As the Cato Institute\u2019s Michael Cannon has explained, if these (basically identical) suits succeed, something like 7 million Americans in those 36 states will lose access to around $36 billion in federal premium subsidies in the next few years. On the other hand, thanks to the law\u2019s complex interlocking structure, 250,000 firms (and 57 million Americans) will also be liberated from the law\u2019s employer mandate, and 8.3 million Americans will be liberated from the individual mandate.\n\nThe two cases are: Halbig v. Burwell (heard in the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals) and King v. Burwell (in the Fourth Circuit). (Full disclosure: I played a small role in initiating King.)\n\n[MORE: Cartoons on Obamacare]\n\nThe question before both courts was: Can the IRS legally provide Obamacare subsidies in an exchange not \u201cestablished by a state\u201d (i.e., established by the federal government)? In Halbig, two judges on a three-judge panel answered \u201cno.\u201d In King, a three-judge panel unanimously answered \u201cyes.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Halbig panel reasoned that the IRS subsidies are statutorily authorized only in exchanges \u201cestablished by a state,\u201d and since the federal government is not a state, Congress didn\u2019t authorize subsidies in any state that declines to to set up an exchange, even if the feds have set one up themselves. The King panel took precisely the opposite view. To read the law literally, it said, would be \u201cabsurd.\u201d Congress must have intended for its reforms to apply in all states, regardless of who creates the exchange.\n\nThe Halbig panel found Congress\u2019s intent to be ambiguous, but the text clear. The King panel held the reverse: that the text is ambiguous, but the intent is clear.\n\nI\u2019ll bet the family farm that this issue ends up in the Supreme Court. Both circuits are likely to hear the respective cases \u201cen banc,\u201d that is, before all the judges, not just a select subset. If the two circuits come out on opposite sides, the high court will then be forced to sort matters out. If they rule the same way, the losing side will appeal to the Supreme Court, because of the high stakes. If four justices consent to take the case, it will be heard.\n\nCurrently, four of the nine Supreme Court Justices were appointed by Democratic presidents, the remaining five by Republicans. (In 2012, four of the more conservative justices voted to strike down Obamacare altogether.) Unless both circuits rule the same way and present an absolutely ironclad argument for their decisions, the odds of four justices voting to take the case are high.\n\n[READ: Extreme Makeover: Obamacare Edition]\n\nAnd now to the \u201cterritorial problem.\u201d The administration\u2019s lawyers claim Congress could not possibly have intended to deny federal subsidies in exchange-declining states because its overall intention was to create a new, more affordable insurance system for all Americans by way of a package of interdependent policies that constitute a \u201cthree-legged stool\u201d: 1. Insurance mandates that requires insurers to take all applicants, and price their policies, regardless of an applicant\u2019s health status, known as \u201cguaranteed issue\u201d and \u201ccommunity rating.\u201d 2. An individual mandate that forces Americans to obtain Affordable Care Act-compliant health coverage. 3. Federal tax-credit subsidies to help lower-income Americans afford the mandatory coverage, provided they buy it through an exchange.\n\nNaturally, a stool with fewer than three legs falls down. Most experts agree that without all three of the aforementioned legs, Obamacare\u2019s market reforms will almost certainly topple. But did Congress intend for all three legs to apply everywhere? Yes, claims the administration. Therefore, \u201cestablished by a state\u201d should be read to mean \u201cestablished by or on behalf of a state.\u201d\n\nBut this argument runs into a problem when we come to U.S. territories, such as Guam or American Samoa. The Affordable Care Act specifically exempts them from the second leg of the stool (the individual mandate). Apparently a two-legged stool can stand in a U.S. territory.\n\nIt\u2019s a contradiction the law\u2019s defenders must address. And yet the judges who upheld Obamacare\u2019s subsidies in King silently passed over it. That\u2019s telling.\n\nAnd by the way, a two-legged stool can\u2019t stand. In fact, territorial health insurance markets are currently collapsing, precisely because Congress exempted them from the stool\u2019s second leg (the individual mandate).\n\n[SEE: Political Cartoons]\n\nFearing such a collapse, the territories have long been asking Congress to impose the individual mandate on them too. The administration reponse: \u201cSorry, our hands are tied by the statute.\u201d Territorial reply: \u201cOkay, then suspend the insurance mandates, so our insurance markets don\u2019t implode.\u201d Administration: \u201cSorry, our hands are tied by the statute.\u201d\n\nThen, last week, on the eve of the Halbig and King rulings, the administration reversed itself. It decided to cease enforcing the insurance mandates in the territories, despite a clear statutory requirement to do so. So now we have a one-legged stool in Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands. Happy times.\n\nSo here are some questions for the administration:\n\n1) If congressional intent ought to govern in all cases, why are you flouting it in the territories?\n\n2) If Congress intended that all three legs of the stool should apply everywhere, why did it specifically remove one of those legs (the individual mandate) in the territories?\n\n3) If Congress expressly chose to exempt some Americans (in territories) from one leg of the stool (the individual mandate), why is it so hard to believe it also exempted other Americans (in certain states) from another leg of the stool (federal subsidies)?\n\n[READ: When the Law is the Law]\n\nNo matter what happens, this much is clear: Obamacare is in for additional near-death experiences.\n\nIf the administration prevails in the subsidy cases, Congress will still have to reopen the law to deal with the lack of functioning insurance markets in the territories, which will naturally invite a debate over whether the \u201cthree-legged stool\u201d ought to be amended or repealed everywhere.\n\nIf, however, the administration loses the subsidy cases, Obamacare\u2019s controversial market reforms will be all but abolished in 36 states. That will force lawmakers and governors in those states to revisit whether to set up an exchange, and force Congress to reopen the law to provide subsidies in the hold-out states. Or conversely, to repeal the mandates in those states. Or maybe just repeal the whole darn law.\n\nHappy times.", "article_metadata": {"zone": "homepage/articles", "keyword": "Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "title": "Halbig and King Subsidy Cases Are Obamacare's Next Near-Death Experience", "og": {"site_name": "US News & World Report", "description": "A dueling pair of court cases show more trouble is in store for the health care law.", "title": "Obamacare's Next Near-Death Experience", "url": "http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/opinion-blog/2014/07/25/halbig-and-king-subsidy-cases-are-obamacares-next-near-death-experience", "image": "http://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/aa/f0/4caa6f1d42c1b03b326699986d58/20140723edhan-a.tif", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@USNews", "description": "A dueling pair of court cases show more trouble is in store for the health care law.", "card": "summary", "title": "Halbig and King Subsidy Cases Are Obamacare's Next Near-Death Experience"}, "msvalidate.01": "A8E47FA91124063A4A9C78AD5273DC0F", "site": "opinion", "date_published": "July 25, 2014", "fb": {"app_id": 130063997038366}, "page_type": "article", "keywords": "Dean Clancy,Affordable Care Act,Obama, Barack,Obama administration,health care reform,Thomas Jefferson Street [Opinion]", "google-site-verification": "owJBuFHD3VHcTSsnPSOYizmUcs3GSBjbx09vBbBi1MM", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A dueling pair of court cases show more trouble is in store for the health care law."}, "article_summary": "If, however, the administration loses the subsidy cases, Obamacare\u2019s controversial market reforms will be all but abolished in 36 states.\nThe two cases are: Halbig v.
