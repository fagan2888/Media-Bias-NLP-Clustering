The report also documents numerous attacks, including destruction of churches, rape, kidnapping, torture, and enslavement.\n\nOn Monday, The Daily Signal profiled the face of the Knights of Columbus\u2019 campaign for action, the Rev. Douglas al-Bazi, a Catholic priest who was held hostage by terrorists in Iraq.\n\nWhen al-Bazi was kidnapped by terrorists in November 2006, the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, didn\u2019t formally exist yet.\n\nBut as ISIS came to rise, and became a greater threat, al-Bazi in 2013 fled his working-class neighborhood of Baghdad for Erbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, where he works as a priest at Mar Elia Refugee Camp.\n\nReacting to Thursday\u2019s news that Kerry determined ISIS has committed genocide, al-Bazi sent The Daily Signal a video message he recorded from the refugee camp.\n\n\u201cWe are and still are victims,\u201d al-Bazi said in the video. \u201cI want to thank all of the people who helped our people [by making] the declaration as a genocide. This is the first right step. Now we have to work together on how we can save the lives of our people here.\u201d\n\nThough the genocide designation is unlikely to have much impact on the United States-led military campaign against the Islamic State, it signals to religious minorities, including Shitte Muslims and Yazidis, that the Western world recognizes the pain these groups have gone through and is in solidarity with them as they seek to recover.\n\n\u201cIn my judgment, Da\u2019esh is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control, including Yazidis, Christians and Shia Muslims,\u201d Kerry said at a news conference in Washington using the Arabic name for ISIS. \u201cDa\u2019esh is genocidal by self-proclamation, by ideology and by actions.\u201d\n\nKerry\u2019s decision came in response to a March 17 deadline set by Congress for the State Department to determine whether ISIS is guilty of genocide against minorities in Iraq and Syria.\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. House passed a non-binding bill by a vote of 393-0 declaring ISIS\u2019 actions against Christians and other minority groups, including the Yazidis and Kurds, \u201cgenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.\u201d\n\nFollowing Kerry\u2019s decision, House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., complimented the secretary of state, but also encouraged the Obama administration to intensify its military effort against ISIS.\n\n\u201cNow that our government is recognizing this crisis, it needs to do more to stop it,\u201d Ryan said in a statement. \u201cI hope the president will seize this opportunity to present a very clear strategy to defeat this enemy. And to all those brave people who are being persecuted, I would simply like to say this: We will stand with you, we will pray for you, and we will work every day to put these words into action.\u201d\n\nKerry\u2019s determination that ISIS has committed genocide marks only the second time the U.S. has made that distinction during an ongoing conflict, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIn 2004, then Secretary of State Colin Powell said atrocities being committed in Sudan\u2019s Darfur region qualified as genocide.", "article_metadata": {"description": "An Iraqi priest who was held hostage by terrorists thanks Secretary of State John Kerry for declaring that ISIS has committed \"genocide\" on Christians.", "og": {"site_name": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An Iraqi priest who was held hostage by terrorists thanks Secretary of State John Kerry for declaring that ISIS has committed \"genocide\" on Christians.", "title": "Iraqi Priest: Kerry Is Right That ISIS Commits Genocide", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/KerryGenocide.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-03-18T09:07:16+00:00", "type": "article"}, "bitly": {"url": "http://dailysign.al/1RpoBp2"}, "twitter": {"domain": "The Daily Signal", "description": "An Iraqi priest who was held hostage by terrorists thanks Secretary of State John Kerry for declaring that ISIS has committed \"genocide\" on Christians.", "title": "Iraqi Priest: Kerry Is Right That ISIS Commits Genocide", "image": {"src": "http://dailysignal.com/wp-content/uploads/KerryGenocide.jpg"}, "creator": "@dailysignal", "site": "@dailysignal", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "fb": {"pages": 300341323465160, "app_id": 772296266137346}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheDailySignalNews", "section": "Security", "tag": "terrorism", "published_time": "2016-03-17T17:23:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-03-18T09:07:16+00:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "news_keywords": "ISIS, genocide, John Kerry, Knights of Columbus, Iraq, Syria, Islamic State, Paul Ryan, terrorism"}, "article_summary": "Reacting to Thursday\u2019s news that Kerry determined ISIS has committed genocide, al-Bazi sent The Daily Signal a video message he recorded from the refugee camp.\nHuman rights and religious groups had long pushed for the State Department to declare ISIS\u2019 atrocities a genocide.\n\u201cIn my judgment, Da\u2019esh is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its control, including Yazidis, Christians and Shia Muslims,\u201d Kerry said at a news conference in Washington using the Arabic name for ISIS.\nSecretary of State John Kerry formally declared Thursday that attacks from the Islamic State terrorist group against Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East constitute genocide.\nIn 2004, then Secretary of State Colin Powell said atrocities being committed in Sudan\u2019s Darfur region qualified as genocide."}
