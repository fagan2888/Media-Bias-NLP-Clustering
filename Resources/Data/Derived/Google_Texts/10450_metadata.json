They accuse insurers of violating Affordable Care Act provisions that prohibit discrimination against those with specific diseases.\n\nThe waiting-period rule, which is in effect for policies sold by Premera Blue Cross, BridgeSpan Health, Moda Health and Group Health, applies to the entire transplant process, meaning that patients must wait 90 days before even beginning an evaluation. The evaluations, which include everything from screening tests to interviews with social workers and nutritionists, often take several months. Once a patient is approved, the wait on a transplant list could be several more months or even years, depending on the person\u2019s condition, the organ involved, and the hospital.\n\n\u201cThe whole idea of creating a waiting period for someone who is dying of organ failure is the antithesis of what the Affordable Care Act is supposed to be about,\u201d said Roslyn B. Mannon, immediate past president of the American Society of Transplantation and a transplant nephrologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nSusanna Nazarian, assistant professor of transplant surgery at the University of Washington, put it more bluntly: \u201cPutting this additional barrier in front of them will lead to some patients passing away.\u201d\n\nInsurance company representatives said they were complying with what is allowed under the Washington state benchmark plan. Stephanie Marquis, a spokeswoman for the Washington state insurance commissioner\u2019s office, said the original waiting period for transplants for plans purchased through the state exchange was six months but it was reduced to 90 days \u201cto match what was allowed under federal law.\u201d\n\nMarquis said the insurance office has since heard from consumers who think that any waiting period is discriminatory, and that the office is looking into the issue further.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t give you a specific time frame yet, but we do take their concerns seriously,\u201d she said.\n\nThe waiting periods apply only to those who did not have prior coverage. If a member had been continuously enrolled in a different plan 90 days prior to incurring the transplant-related expenses, he or she would be exempt. If a member had coverage for less than 90 days, the exclusion period is reduced by one day for each day of prior coverage.\n\nPatient advocates have successfully pushed back against a similar provision in Oregon that allowed insurers to impose a 24-month waiting period for transplants. The insurance commissioner eliminated that rule on Dec. 31 and told insurers there should be no waiting period.\n\nSandy Praeger, past president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners and the head of the insurance department in Kansas, said she has not heard about similar restrictions on transplants in other states, but she expects more issues to arise in the coming year as consumers who purchased the plans start to visit doctors. \u201cIt\u2019s something that might not surface until people start exercising their benefits. They may not realize the waiting period was in there,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act prohibits \u201cexcessive\u201d waiting periods, which it defines as more than 90 days. But it does not indicate whether specific benefits could be subject to a waiting period, and state officials have interpreted the law in different ways.", "article_metadata": {"description": "They say 90 day waiting period for transplants in Washington State violates the Affordable Care Act.", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/arianaeunjung.cha", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "description": "They say 90 day waiting period for transplants in Washington State violates the Affordable Care Act.", "title": "Medical advocates accuse insurers of discrimination", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/patient-groups-protest-insurance-rules-in-wash-state-that-require-waits-for-transplants/2014/01/26/9a6f8940-7fc2-11e3-95c6-0a7aa80874bc_story.html", "image": "https://images.washingtonpost.com/?url=https://img.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-3000x1568.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias", "type": "article"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@arianaeunjung"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=938922398, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/patient-groups-protest-insurance-rules-in-wash-state-that-require-waits-for-transplants/2014/01/26/9a6f8940-7fc2-11e3-95c6-0a7aa80874bc_story.html", "fb": {"admins": 500835072, "app_id": 41245586762}, "keywords": "transplant waiting period, transplant 90 day waiting period, 90 day waiting time transplants, washington state, oregon, insurance companies 90 day waiting period, health exchange, affordable care act, chronic illness, discrimination affordable care act, heart transplant affordable care act, obamacare, liver transplant, pancreas transplant, kidney transplant, health", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/washingtonpost", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/arianaeunjung.cha"}, "eomportal-uuid": "9a6f8940-7fc2-11e3-95c6-0a7aa80874bc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=0.5, maximum-scale=2.0", "news_keywords": "transplant waiting period, transplant 90 day waiting period, 90 day waiting time transplants, washington state, oregon, insurance companies 90 day waiting period, health exchange, affordable care act, chronic illness, discrimination affordable care act, heart transplant affordable care act, obamacare, liver transplant, pancreas transplant, kidney transplant, health"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd8498\"", "article_summary": "But it does not indicate whether specific benefits could be subject to a waiting period, and state officials have interpreted the law in different ways.\nPatient advocates have successfully pushed back against a similar provision in Oregon that allowed insurers to impose a 24-month waiting period for transplants.\nThey may not realize the waiting period was in there,\u201d she said.\nThe insurance commissioner eliminated that rule on Dec. 31 and told insurers there should be no waiting period.\nThe Affordable Care Act prohibits \u201cexcessive\u201d waiting periods, which it defines as more than 90 days."}
