The \u2019794 Patent provides \u201ca number of methods directed to the multiplexing amplification and/or genotyping reactions of target sequences to create amplicons that can subsequently be detected on an array.\u201d The earliest possible effective filing date of the \u2019794 Patent is September 2000.\n\nThe Board began with the lone ground of unpatentability \u2013 that the challenged claims are anticipated by Fan. First, the Board discussed whether Fan is available as prior art. Patent Owner contended that Fan is not prior art because its filing date (February 7, 2000) is after the effective filing date of the \u2019794 Patent. Petitioner argued that Fan incorporates the disclosure of the \u2019810 provisional, thus, Fan is prior art as of the filing date of the \u2019810 provisional (February 7, 2000). Patent Owner argued that Petitioner failed to prove that the subject matter cited from Fan is supported by the \u2019810 provisional. Petitioner responded that Fan is clearly prior art because it incorporates the \u2019810 provisional by reference. Petitioner also argued that Patent Owner did not establish that the \u2019794 Patent has priority before the filing date of Fan.\n\nAfter oral hearing, the Federal Circuit issued a decision (Dynamic Drinkware LLC, v. National Graphics, Inc., 800 F.3d 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2015)), finding that a petitioner had failed to demonstrate that its prior art was entitled to the filing date of the provisional because it had failed to compare the portions of the prior art it was relying upon to the provisional. The Federal Circuit held that in an inter partes review, the petitioner has the burden of production to demonstrate that the reference is prior art, but the burden then shifts to the patent owner to argue or provide evidence that the reference was not prior art to the challenged claims by providing evidence of an earlier filing date. The burden then shifts once again to petitioner to prove that the reference is entitled to the filing date of the provisional application. Therefore, the Board found that the claims of the patent document must be supported by the earlier filed application to which priority is being sought, in compliance with 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112. The Board then determined that in this case, the incorporation by reference of the \u2019810 provisional into Fan does not itself meet the requirement that the claims of Fan are supported by the \u2019810 provisional in compliance with 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, first paragraph.\n\nIn the subsequent briefing on Dynamic Drinkware, Petitioner argued that it made a prima facie showing that Fan is prior art to the \u2019794 patent and that Patent Owner never demonstrated that the \u2019794 Patent was entitled to an earlier filing date, and that Patent Owner waived its argument that the claims of Fan are not supported by the \u2019810 provisional. Patent Owner responded that Petitioner did not put Patent Owner on notice as to Petitioner\u2019s prior art theory, and, therefore, did not meet its burden of production.\n\nThe Board concluded that Patent Owner had the better position, noting there was no argument in the Petition that the \u2019794 Patent was not entitled to the earliest possible effective filing date. Therefore, the Petition put Patent Owner on notice that Petitioner was relying on Fan with an effective filing date of the \u2019810 provisional. Further, Patent Owner argued in its Response that Fan was not entitled to the effective filing date of the \u2019810 provisional, therefore, Patent Owner met its burden. Finally, Petitioner did not meet its burden of demonstrating that Fan was entitled to the effective filing date of the \u2019810 provisional.\n\nPetitioner also argued that Dynamic Drinkwareis inapplicable because it dealt with issued patents, not published applications, such as Fan. The Board was not convinced by this argument.\n\nAriosa Diagnostics, Inc. v.
