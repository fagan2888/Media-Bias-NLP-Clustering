GOP presidential hopeful Ben Carson says he doesn't think it's possible to adhere to Sharia law and accept American values.

Neurosurgeon and GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson accused Muslims who both adhere to Islamic law and embrace American values of being "schizophrenic."

In an interview Monday with Breitbart News' Stephen K. Bannon, Carson was asked whether he believes Muslims who are "Sharia adherent" can also participate in a Democratic society governed by the rule of law.

"Only if they're schizophrenic," Carson said. "I don't see how they can do it otherwise, because they have two different philosophies boring at you [that contradict each other]. That would be very difficult."

Carson also argued political correctness will leave Americans vulnerable to ISIS threats.

"We would be so busy trying to protect their rights that we wouldn't be watching our own," he said. "When I say things like that, people say 'Oh you're Islamophobic.' No, it's not Islamophobic at all... There's a difference between Muslims who accept America and accept our Constitution and accept our ways and those who want to continue a different method of living. And if we're not sophisticated enough to understand that we will lose that war."
