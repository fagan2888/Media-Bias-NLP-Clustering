Earlier this month, Mony Weschler, chief IT strategist at Montefiore Medical Center, implored healthcare software developers to open their APIs and standardize data sharing in an article he wrote for InformationWeek. In June, ONC unveiled a 10-year interoperability roadmap, building on a vision that National Coordinator for Health IT Karen DeSalvo began sharing soon after taking on the office's leadership role.\n\n[Will wearable healthcare gadgets bring privacy problems?

Not only must interoperability become better, but Rand determined some vendors \"proactively block\" the sharing of clinical and administrative information. To comply with meaningful use, EHRs must integrate, something applications might accomplish through the main application or via an add-on.\n\nVendor executives have pointed to their interoperability initiatives. Epic users exchanged 313,000 records with users of other systems in June 2014, Peter DeVault, director of interoperability at Epic, told Politico. Epic, which was criticized in the Rand report, saw tens of thousands of those data exchanges within federal agencies alone, he said.\n\n\"If you talk to our customers and [see] the ease in which they're able to set up connections with non-Epic sites, you'll find exactly the opposite, that we have a great reputation,\" DeVault said in the article.\n\nInteroperability is too important to take at face value or to rely on patches, especially when so many healthcare professionals continue to clamor for improvements, said Jim Bialick, president of the Patient Safety Movement Foundation, in an interview.\n\n\"It is time that we took a close look at all of this; interoperability, at its core, is a patient safety issue. Interoperability is central to realizing the promise of health IT and that extends beyond sending records back-and-forth, point-to-point.
