PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN 6) — When Alta Lund was born, Roosevelt was president. Teddy Roosevelt.

Alta Lund was born in Colton on Christmas Day in 1906. She celebrated her 108th birthday with her daughter, Dolores Crawford, and grandson, Bill Crawford at the facility where she lives.

She’s lived her whole life in Oregon – mostly in Roseburg, Eugene and Tillamook. She married Fred Lund, who at one time was the mayor of Glendale, Oregon.

“She really is a treasure. She only came here (to the Nehalem Valley Care Center) two years ago. She lived alone all that time, did her own cooking and everything,” said her daughter, Dolores Crawford.

“Everytime I tell my friends that my grandmother is 108 years old, their mouths drop open. It is just amazing,” said Bill Crawford. “Still has all of her memory. The only thing she has a problem with right now, basically, is her hearing.”

Her daughter said she’s “still got her tonsils and everything.” She’s always been healthy, always worked outside and loved to garden, Dolores said.

Now she plays Bingo and takes part in the field activities at the center.

Sometimes they visit and “share her love of watching TV westerns,” Bill said. That may be in part because when she was born most people still had horses.

“That was the only way to get around,” Alta Lund said.

Bill said the family has “fond memories of my grandmother and my grandpa Fred. She was an incredible lady back then and moreso now, and I’m thankful she is still with us.”

The only drawback is she said she’s never gotten any presents on her birthday — just Christmas presents.
