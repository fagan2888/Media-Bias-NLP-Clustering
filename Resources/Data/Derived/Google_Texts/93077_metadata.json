It was partly because of the White House publicity push claiming to have met enrollment standards for ObamaCare last week. But it was mostly because of a twofold strategy now on display: appeal to centrist voters by embracing some modest mitigations of the law while leaving President Obama to petrify Democratic base voters with targeted threats about what a Republican Senate might do. Let Obama, already unpopular with independents, play the heel while Senate Democrats get to adopt poses of concern and independence. Take that Nate Silver! But that happy thought bubble just got popped. Health-insurance premiums are accelerating at the fastest pace ever measured in a survey conducted by market analysts at Morgan Stanley. The forecast rise, largely attributable to ObamaCare, comes from a survey of insurance brokers around the country. As American Enterprise Institute scholar Scott Gottlieb explains for Forbes, the numbers are crushingly high (this chart highlights the spike).\n\n[Among the states seeing the sharpest increases are several with competitive Senate races including: New Hampshire (forecast to suffer a 90-percent rate increase for individual plans), Colorado, Michigan, Georgia and Kentucky.]\n\nDems pay for premiums - Whatever any ads claim or however many talking points seep out of the White House, the most effective communications of the midterm cycle will be in the form of rate notices and cancellations from insurers. Just as flickering Republican hopes in 2008 were snuffed by the arrival in mailboxes of retirement account statements that revealed the magnitude of the damage caused by that year\u2019s financial panic, health insurance rate cards will do the greatest damage to Democratic hopes of retaining the Senate. While Obama Democrats claim that success or failure of the law is reflected in how many people signed up for free or subsidized insurance, the real measure will be in how the law affects the insurance policies of the 85 percent of Americans who had coverage before the ObamaCare experiment began. If this forecast holds true and voters see insurance premium increases of the kind outlined in the survey, there\u2019s no spin or strategy that can save a Senate majority.\n\nBOEHNER OPENS DOOR TO MORE CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR IRS\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner left the door open to potential contempt charges against other IRS officials even as he confirmed to Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly that lawmakers plan to press the Justice Department to consider a criminal case against ex-IRS official Lois Lerner for \u2018misleading the Congress.\u2019 Boehner also said if Lerner does not cooperate soon by providing information on the IRS targeting scandal, the House would hold her in contempt. \u201cSomebody at the IRS violated the law,\u201d Boehner said on \u201cThe Kelly File.\u201d \u201cWhether it was Lois Lerner or not, we\u2019ll find out.\u201d Pressed by Kelly on whether IRS chief John Koskinen could also face contempt charges because he suggested documents demanded by Congress wouldn\u2019t be available for years, Boehner said \u201cI think it's a little premature to go that far.\u201d Watch Boehner\u2019s interview on \u201cthe Kelly File.\u201d\n\nIRS officials said no liberal groups were targeted - Daily Caller: \u201cIRS agents testified before Congress that the agency\u2019s political targeting did not apply to [liberal] groups as Democrats and the media have claimed, according to a bombshell new staff report prepared by the House Oversight Committee chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa.\u201d\n\nWHITE HOUSE MANSPLAINS MISLEADING GENDER PAY STATS\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s effort to trim midterm losses for Democrats by attacking Republican resistance to gender pay equity legislation went awry Monday. Even as President Obama continues to push the agenda (he\u2019ll sign two executive orders today) a top administration economist was forced to walk back the White House\u2019s talking points. Washington Examiner: \u201cBetsey Stevenson, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said very defiantly that despite women contributing 44 percent of their household incomes, they continue to make less than men\u2026 [A]s soon as Stevenson was actually questioned about the statistic by McClatchy reporter Lindsay Wise, the White House adviser crumbled, admitting her earlier comments were inaccurate. \u2018If I said 77 cents was equal pay for equal work, then I completely misspoke,\u2019 Stevenson said\u2026 \u2018Seventy-seven cents captures the annual earnings of full-time, full-year women divided by the annual earnings of full-time, full-year men,\u2019 Stevenson clarified. \u2018There are a lot of things that go into that 77-cents figure, there are a lot of things that contribute and no one\u2019s trying to say that it\u2019s all about discrimination.\u2019\u2019\u2019\n\n[Watch Fox: Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., appears in the 1 p.m. ET hour]\n\nCarney: It\u2019s complicated - NYT: \u201cEven as [President Obama] seeks to make an issue of the gender gap in compensation across the country, however, his own hiring is facing some scrutiny\u2026 [A] recent study, by the conservative American Enterprise Institute, showed that the median annual salary for women in the White House last year was $65,000, while the median annual salary for men was $73,729. The study was based on White House salary data\u2026Jay Carney, the president\u2019s press secretary\u2026said that the 88-cent statistic was misleading because it aggregates the salaries of White House staff members at all levels, including the lowest levels, where women outnumber men.\u201d\n\n[Emily Miller notes that as Senate Democratic leaders celebrate \u201cEqual Pay Day\u201d with a symbolic vote and floor speeches attacking Republicans for sexism, the same leaders all have male chiefs of staff and communications directors.]\n\nFUGGEDABOUTIT: SHARPTON SAYS MOB MOLE ROLE NOT NEWS\n\nMSNBC host Al Sharpton says the revelation from The Smoking Gun that federal agents \u201cflipped\u201d him during a mid-1980s drug probe to obtain his cooperation in an undercover operation against organized crime figures is not news. Sharpton told Fox News\u2019 Joe Weber: \u201cI don\u2019t see this as news, This has been brought up three or four times now. I don\u2019t understand. It\u2019s crazy.\u201d Sharpton is still pretty cool with a cozy relationship with the federal government. He will host President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder at a community organizing event this week.\n\nWITH YOUR SECOND CUP OF COFFEE...\n\nMelissa Healy examines the effect of chronic poverty on children for LAT: \u201cBy the time they have reached the fourth grade, African American boys who have run a childhood gantlet of poverty, shifting family structure, harsh parenting and a mother\u2019s low mood and educational attainment will have signs of premature genetic aging that can deepen their vulnerability to mental and physical illness, says a new study\u2026 The latest research underscores that poverty exacts its wages on a person's health early and at the most profound levels\u2026 The study, published Monday in the journal PNAS, also offers insight into the range of environmental factors linked to poverty that corrode a child's health.\u201d\n\nGot a TIP from the RIGHT or LEFT?

The ads come after Democrats have settled on a midterm strategy of depicting Republican hopefuls as the handmaidens of industry because of the activities of groups like Freedom Partners. The organization is out today with two ads, backed by more than $1 million, against Iowa Senate frontrunner Rep. Bruce Braley and against Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo. Here\u2019s the script from the Braley spot: \u201cThe government spent millions of taxpayer dollars to promote it. Now, health insurance companies stand to make billions, and Bruce Braley, he takes tens of thousands from his friends in the health insurance industries. For Iowans, it\u2019s cancelled policies and higher costs. That\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nSCHUMER TOOK KOCH MONEY\n\nHere\u2019s what Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told MSNBC on Monday in defense of his party\u2019s 2014 strategy of attacking conservative patrons Charles and David Koch: \u201cThe Koch brothers aren\u2019t just sitting there innocently on the side. They\u2019re spending $40, $50 million in ads that are not focused on their real agenda, which is just eliminating all regulation on corporations, cutting taxes to virtually nothing. And so that demands a response. So I don\u2019t feel sorry for them.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s what Schumer said about the Kochs\u2019 political activities in 2010: \u201cAgain, I can\u2019t thank you enough. All of my best to you and yours and I look forward to working with you throughout this election.\u201d\n\nThe difference, according to the letter posted by PowerLine\u2019s John Hinderaker, is that in 2010 Schumer was the beneficiary, receiving a \u201cgenerous\u201d contribution from KOCHPAC, the political action committee for Koch Industries.\n\n[Washington Free Beacon: \u201cAccording to campaign finance records, former Koch Industries lobbyist Robert P. Hall III donated $500 to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s] campaign in 2003.\u201d]\n\nUGLY AIR WAR IN MISSISSIPPI PRIMARY\n\nTwo outside conservative groups have expanded their air campaigns in support of Mississippi State Sen. Chris McDaniel\u2019s effort to oust fellow Republican six-term incumbent Sen. Thad Cochran The political action committee associated with the Senate Conservatives fund is out with a positive McDaniel ad which features the candidate denouncing compromise on constitutional principles while The Club for Growth goes negative saying of Cochran, \u201cfive decades in Washington is enough. But as Washington Examiner reports, Cochran's campaign is ramping up its attacks with an ad hitting McDaniel for waffling on whether he would have supported Hurricane Katrina relief funds. The race represents what may be the best hope for the outside groups to unseat an incumbent moderate this cycle.\n\n[WaPo details how the Obama administration is using its executive powers to help embattled Senate Democrats.]\n\nPICK SIX: HE\u2019S GOOD ENOUGH, HE\u2019S SMART ENOUGH\u2026\n\nWhich six Democrat-held Senate seats present the most likely path for the GOP to win control of the upper chamber?

Mark Udall, D-Colo., raised $2 million and has more than $5.9 cash on hand. Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., had $800,000 in his campaign account at the beginning of the year that he can use for his Senate run.\n\nGeorgia - Weekly Standard: \u201cKaren Handel, the former secretary of state of Georgia, has raised $200,000 in the past two weeks for her campaign for Senate, according to a spokesman. \u2026Helping boost Handel in her five-way GOP primary is former vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, who recently endorsed Handel and traveled to Georgia on Friday for a public appearance. About half of the campaign's two-week haul has come after Palin's appearance.\u201d\n\nLouisiana - Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., is boasting that she raised $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2014, nearly $600,000 more than Republican frontrunner Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-La., who announced his total Monday.

Kay Hagan in North Carolina, raised $1.3 million in the first three months of the year, according to a person familiar with his totals.\u201d\n\nTHAT\u2019S ONE WAY TO RAISE YOUR QUARTERLY HAUL\n\nBillings Gazette : \u201cHELENA \u2014 Long-shot Republican U.S. Senate candidate Champ Edmunds hasn\u2019t raised much campaign cash so far, but on Sunday, he found $12,000 cash in an abandoned backpack, outside his Missoula church. \u2018That\u2019s what I thought it was: Somebody left some money for my campaign,\u2019 Edmunds said with a laugh on Monday. \u2018And the other deacon (at the church) said, 'Hey, what are you talking about? That money was left for the church!\u2019\u2019 Whatever it was left for, the cash and other contents of the small backpack are now in the hands of the Missoula Police Department, which is searching for the owner.\u201d\n\nIT SEEMED LIKE A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME\n\nSouth Dakota Democratic candidate Rick Weiland thought he had staged something of a media coup when he got Republican candidate Stace Nelson to join him for a press conference attacking GOP frontrunner former Gov. Mike Rounds for taking out-of-state contributions. But\u2026 From the Sioux Falls Argus Leader: \u201c\u2026things went off the rails almost immediately. The two candidates talked past each other in their opening statements, and things got wilder when the two took questions from the entire audience of more than three dozen citizens and reporters. Instead of the evils of big money, Weiland and Nelson spent much of the 25-minute press conference being asked about medical marijuana and the \u2018Red Chinese,\u2019 arguing with questioners, being interrupted by candidates for other offices sitting in the audience\u2026\u201d\n\nDOC CASSIDY PROVIDES MID-AIR AID\n\nNew Orleans Times-Picayune: \u201cFor a passenger on Southwest Flight 2157 Monday between New Orleans and Baltimore, it might not have been a big deal that a congressman was on board. But the passenger, who lost consciousness as the plane flew towards its destination, was no doubt happy the congressman also happened to be a physician. Rep. Bill Cassidy, [R-La.] a physician by profession, along with another doctor on board, helped treat the passenger.\u201d\n\nWILL KISSING CONGRESSMAN HANG ON?\n\nNo word yet on any action to be taken by or against Rep. Vance McAllister, R-La., in the wake of his admission to have \u201cfallen short\u201d and \u201casking for forgiveness\u201d after a video surfaced of him making out with a female staffer. But the New Orleans Times-Picayune has some background on the relationship: \u201c\u2026McAllister has long had ties to [the staffer] and her family. Both [the staffer] and her husband contributed to McAllister's campaign, and the congressman worked and attended the same high school as [her] husband.\u201d\n\n\n\nNEW ANTI-CRIST AD DEBUTS AS SCOTT PULLS INTO TIE\n\nLet\u2019s Get to Work, the group backed by Gov.
