Now, a newly elected mayor and Metro Council will craft the rules to make Amendment 3 work.\n\nGlenn Farner (Photo: Submitted)\n\nNashville can learn from Cleveland, Ohio, where a local-hire law has succeeded without increasing costs or causing delays.\n\nCleveland \u2014 with approximately half the population of Nashville \u2014 has been able to meet its local-hire requirements. So rather than cast doubt on how to build a local-hire program that works for Nashville, we believe that we should convene in the coming weeks a working group to start the conversation on how we implement a Nashville-focused local-hire program.\n\nFrom the construction industry to labor and faith leaders to the Chamber of Commerce, we want a diverse group of stakeholders to come to the table.\n\nWe want to heed the voters\u2019 call to put in place a responsible and Nashville- focused local-hire program. Let\u2019s bring our collective experiences to the table so we can advise our city leaders on a program that is inclusive of all.\n\nWe know that a divide-and-conquer approach will not work given that Amendment 3 passed by almost 20 points.\n\nSo let\u2019s take a community-united approach and stay focused on Nashville\u2019s success.\n\nMoreover, according to the Census Bureau, we have 16,000 able-bodied Nashville men and women today who are unemployed, living at or below the poverty line and are the right age for construction work (18 to 44).\n\nSo, with some training, we can have the workforce we need to make Amendment 3 work.\n\nThis means we have a real opportunity to transform jobs to careers in the construction industry.\n\nThis means more Nashville residents are bringing home a paycheck and investing in the local economy.\n\nIn the end, there is no smarter investment we can make than local jobs.\n\nGlenn Farner, a Davidson County resident, is the business manager and secretary-treasurer of the Southeast Laborers' District Council. Benny Overton serves as vice chair of Nashville Organized for Action and Hope (NOAH).\n\nRead or Share this story: http://tnne.ws/1F4pP4a", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Diverse stakeholders should come together to discuss how to implement Amendment 3.", "og": {"site_name": "The Tennessean", "description": "Diverse stakeholders should come together to discuss how to implement Amendment 3.", "title": "Make local-hire amendment work for Nashville", "url": "http://www.tennessean.com/story/opinion/contributors/2015/08/28/make-local-hire-amendment-work-nashville/71284376/", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/GDContent/applogos/tennessean.png", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "Diverse stakeholders should come together to discuss how to implement Amendment 3.", "title": "Make local-hire amendment work for Nashville", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bda2b8d128c7e47ddbaa1a9fee1fede2dc4c71d2/c=0-17-401-418&r=x643&c=640x640/local/-/media/2015/08/28/Nashville/Nashville/635763866531225813-Benny-Overton.jpg", "creator": "@tennessean", "site": "@tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=600028886", "fb": {"app_id": 121487414583460}, "viewport": "width=1070", "Content-Type": "text/html; charset=UTF-8", "cXenseParse": {"gci-topic": "Organizations/Census Bureau", "gci-asset-type": "data", "gci-categories": "Organizations/Census Bureau", "title": "Make local-hire amendment work for Nashville", "author": "Glenn Farner and Benny Overton", "pageclass": "article", "recs": {"category": "opinion/contributors", "image-3-4": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bdefe88965c2af507106d669321ff130bcc5ac1a/c=0-31-401-565/local/-/media/2015/08/28/Nashville/Nashville/635763866531225813-Benny-Overton.jpg", "image-1-1": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b1019341b165ffde68941406455f3ca4e78db4c0/c=0-17-401-418/local/-/media/2015/08/28/Nashville/Nashville/635763866531225813-Benny-Overton.jpg", "contenttype": "data", "image-4-3": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/fcf1b73d6a898cd0049b355a5cad25ebf8f36f91/c=0-47-401-348/local/-/media/2015/08/28/Nashville/Nashville/635763866531225813-Benny-Overton.jpg", "image": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/994c47c7a9edc26e7982b229af1d1d329c708140/c=0-106-401-332&r=x633&c=1200x630/local/-/media/2015/08/28/Nashville/Nashville/635763866531225813-Benny-Overton.jpg", "publishtime": "2015-08-28T18:26:21.563000-05:00", "shorthed": "Make local-hire amendment work for Nashville", "articleid": 71284376, "image-16-9": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3e9e7c6b4d680c75bb953a9eda0c259e92e92be9/c=0-106-401-332/local/-/media/2015/08/28/Nashville/Nashville/635763866531225813-Benny-Overton.jpg", "image-9-16": "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/71c7e852a613bd439ff8f70950bd48bb3ac4d21d/c=32-0-368-600/local/-/media/2015/08/28/Nashville/Nashville/635763866531225813-Benny-Overton.jpg"}}}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fdd39e\"", "article_summary": "By passing Metro Charter Amendment 3, Nashville voters have said it loud and clear: When Nashville taxpayers fund a construction project, Nashvillians should be hired to work on it.\nRe: \u201cLocal-hire amendment goes step too far,\u201d by Jamie McGee, Aug. 10.\nWhen Nashville taxpayers fund a construction project, Nashvillians should be hired to work on it.\nWe want to heed the voters\u2019 call to put in place a responsible and Nashville- focused local-hire program.\nSo rather than cast doubt on how to build a local-hire program that works for Nashville, we believe that we should convene in the coming weeks a working group to start the conversation on how we implement a Nashville-focused local-hire program."}
