Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Saturday urged Southeast Asian nations to deal with the causes behind a growing humanitarian crisis that has forced thousands of Rohingya from Myanmar and Bangladeshi migrants to flee by sea, leaving many still stranded in boats.\n\nBan said he has been discussing the emergency with regional leaders in Myanmar, Malaysia and Thailand, among others, and urged them to provide search and rescue operations and options for resettlement and reintegration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to save human lives,\u201d he said on a visit to Hanoi, Vietnam. But it\u2019s also important \u201cnot to send them back to a dangerous circumstance or situation.\u201d\n\nMore than 3,600 migrants \u2014 about half of them Bangladeshi and the others minority Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar \u2014 have landed ashore in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand since May 10. Thousands more are believed to be trapped at sea, and the United Nations has warned that time is running out.\n\nFour Malaysian navy ships began searching for boats Friday, according to navy chief Abdul Aziz Jaafar, who said three helicopters and three other ships were on standby. The Malaysian search is a positive sign, but the country\u2019s operation is limited to the country\u2019s territorial waters.\n\nA spokesman for the U.S. Pentagon said Friday that Washington was readying air patrols to aid in the search. But a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman in Bangkok, Melissa Sweeney, told The Associated Press in an email that the offer of assistance was still awaiting clearance.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re actively engaging with the governments of the region to obtain their support and permissions for staging these flights,\u201d she said.\n\nLast week, Malaysia and Indonesia announced they would provide temporary shelter to the migrants for up to one year, and the U.S. has said it would settle some of them permanently.\n\nSpeaking Friday in Myanmar, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said the Rohingyas fleeing the predominantly Buddhist nation were risking perilous journeys and putting their lives in the hands of human traffickers because \u201cthey are in despair and don\u2019t see a future\u201d at home.\n\nThe Rohingya, numbering at around 1.3 million, have been identified by the United Nations as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world. They have been denied citizenship and chased off their land in the latest bout of ethnic violence that left them with little access to education, medical care or freedom to move around.", "article_metadata": {"description": "UN chief says save migrants, deal with cause of flight", "title": "UN chief says save migrants, deal with cause of flight", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "UN chief says save migrants, deal with cause of flight", "title": "UN chief says save migrants, deal with cause of flight", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2015/05/23/un_chief_says_save_migrants_deal_with_cause_of_flight/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/indonesia-rohingya-boat-people.jpeg82-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "UN chief says save migrants, deal with cause of flight", "title": "UN chief says save migrants, deal with cause of flight", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2015/05/indonesia-rohingya-boat-people.jpeg82-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "ROBIN McDOWELL and Tran Van Minh", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, From the Wires", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fd7633\"", "article_summary": "Thousands more are believed to be trapped at sea, and the United Nations has warned that time is running out.\nThe Rohingya, numbering at around 1.3 million, have been identified by the United Nations as one of the most persecuted minorities in the world.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to save human lives,\u201d he said on a visit to Hanoi, Vietnam.\nBan said he has been discussing the emergency with regional leaders in Myanmar, Malaysia and Thailand, among others, and urged them to provide search and rescue operations and options for resettlement and reintegration.\nA spokesman for the U.S. Pentagon said Friday that Washington was readying air patrols to aid in the search."}
