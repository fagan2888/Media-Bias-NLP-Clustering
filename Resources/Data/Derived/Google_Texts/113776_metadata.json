The three-year grant is for an estimated $171,000 per year.\n\n\n\nTC was one of 40 U.S. institutions to receive the HSRA grant, which supports universities and health care institutions to train clinical and counseling psychologists working with other health professions in the provision of health care services to underserved populations such as older adults, children, the chronically ill, victims of abuse and trauma, homeless and populations facing language-barriers.\n\n\u201cConditions such as HIV/AIDS, asthma, diabetes and cardiovascular disease require patients to develop a sense of ownership and responsibility about complying with treatment regimens,\u201d says Dinelia Rosa, Director of the College\u2019s Dean Hope Center for Educational and Psychological Services and Adjunct Associate Professor in the Clinical Program, who is serving as Principal Investigator for the grant. \u201cWith increased treatment compliance, a patient can be stable for a lifetime. Right now, nurses help doctors ensure compliance, but psychologists, in addition to having the cognitive skills to address noncompliance, can complement their work with mindfulness, and additional techniques to increase body-mind connections, and the government is recognizing that we need to train more clinical and counseling psychologists for interprofessional health work. Obamacare is aimed at reducing medical care cost by keeping people healthy and out of medical settings longer, and psychologists will play a big role in this.\u201d\n\nLisa Miller, Professor of Psychology and Education; Marie Miville, Associate Professor of Psychology and Education and Chair, Department of Counseling and Clinical Psychology; and Barry Farber, Professor of Psychology and Education, are all working with Rosa on the grant.\n\nPart of the TC grant funds Spanish-speaking students, who will do their field placement work at Rafael Tavares Mental Health Clinic at Columbia University Medical Center serving low-income Spanish-speaking clients with medical conditions. They will be supervised there by bilingual psychologist and TC alumna Diana Punales Morejon.\n\n\u201cLanguage can become a form of double jeopardy that bars people in need from access to medical care,\u201d Rosa says.\n\nMiville and Elizabeth Fraga, an adjunct faculty member, have also created a course in Latino psychology, which would anchor a planned certificate program in that field.\n\n\n\nThe other TC students funded by the grant will work at Covenant House, where a TC program called Youth Rising, created by Miller and funded by Goldman Sachs helps Covenant House staff address the psychological, psychiatric, and educational needs of the City\u2019s more than 12,000 homeless youth.\n\nAll the students funded by the grant will do supervised pre-field work at TC\u2019s Dean-Hope Center, where those who plan to work Spanish-speaking clients will work with bilingual supervisor Brenda McKee.\n\nCurrently five students have received funding through the grant. They are Elizabeth Hernandez, Biagio Mastropieri, Marielle Buque, Zoe Gurnebaum and Jennifer Drapkin.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing something that\u2019s very new and very innovative to TC and making our clinical and counseling psychology students competitive to work in settings where other students won\u2019t have the skills,\u201d says Rosa, who is President the New York State Psychological Association. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see TC on the front line in psychology and health care as well as in education.\u201d\n\nPublished Tuesday, Jul. 15, 2014", "article_metadata": {"og": {"image": "//www.tc.columbia.edu", "site_name": "Teachers College - Columbia University", "title": "With Federal Grant, TC Takes the Lead on Realizing Obamacare's Goals of Integrated Care"}, "google-site-verification": "L-tWy_e4wl1oZ5eX5jBtLuz57taARPfOHEiuMSYkt4A", "DC.title": "With Federal Grant, TC Takes the Lead on Realizing Obamacare's Goals of Integrated Care", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "With Federal Grant, TC Takes the Lead on Realizing Obamacare's Goals of Integrated Care"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd2ee8\"", "article_summary": "\u201cLanguage can become a form of double jeopardy that bars people in need from access to medical care,\u201d Rosa says.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see TC on the front line in psychology and health care as well as in education.\u201dPublished Tuesday, Jul.\nPart of the TC grant funds Spanish-speaking students, who will do their field placement work at Rafael Tavares Mental Health Clinic at Columbia University Medical Center serving low-income Spanish-speaking clients with medical conditions.\nThe three-year grant is for an estimated $171,000 per year.\nThey will be supervised there by bilingual psychologist and TC alumna Diana Punales Morejon."}
