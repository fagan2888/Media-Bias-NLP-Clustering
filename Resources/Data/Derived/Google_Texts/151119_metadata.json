Doug Ducey has unveiled a plan to step up efforts to reduce the Arizona's Medicaid enrollment numbers. (Photo: Emmanuel Lozano/The Republic) Story Highlights Ducey unveils a plan to step up efforts to reduce the state\u2019s Medicaid enrollment numbers\n\nThe AHCCCS CARE program affects able-bodied adults, but not children or the elderly\n\nIt proposes copays, work requirements, 5-year lifetime limit\n\nGov. Doug Ducey\u2019s plan to modernize Arizona\u2019s Medicaid program has numerous details yet to be worked out. And much of it hinges on approval from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nIts intent is clear: Require the estimated 350,000 able-bodied adults on AHCCCS to take more responsibility for their health coverage through copays and incentives to find work. The idea is to promote healthy, employable people and move them out of the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System before a five-year lifetime limit would cut them off for good.\n\nCritics say the governor is trying to fix something that isn\u2019t broken. Sam Richard, executive director of Protecting Arizona\u2019s Family Coalition, suggested the energy would be better spent reforming the state\u2019s prison system, rather than making it harder for poor people to become independent.\n\nOn Monday, Ducey\u2019s office held a briefing after formally unveiling the program. The following are questions and answers drawn from that briefing.\n\nPREVIOUS: Ducey to ask feds to OK co-pays, other Medicaid changes\n\nRELATED: Key question in Arizona Medicaid fight: Is fee a tax?\n\nRELATED: Many Medicaid-expansion foes in Legislature get prime state insurance\n\nWhy is the governor doing this?\n\nWith the state\u2019s Medicaid program, AHCCCS, up for renewal next year, this is a good time to introduce changes.\n\nWhat are the key changes that would affect the able-bodied adults the governor is targeting?\n\nTo qualify for what would be called the AHCCCS CARE program, these adults would have to:\n\nMake copayments of up to 3 percent of their household income for certain services the state wants to discourage, such as an emergency-room visit when a doctor appointment would suffice. Pay another 2 percent of their income into a health-savings account that could be tapped for health services AHCCCS doesn\u2019t cover, such as dental or vision care. Be actively looking for work and use programs designed to help people find jobs, such as resume writing. Meet certain health goals, such as getting a wellness exam or an annual flu shot.\n\nWhat if I don\u2019t have the money to make the payments?\n\nIf your income is above the federal poverty limit ($11,770 for a single person; $24,250 for a family of four), you would be dropped from the program for six months.\n\nIf your income falls below that limit, the money would be considered a debt to the state, potentially collected through the Department of Revenue.\n\nWhat if I find work, but my salary is low enough to still qualify for AHCCCS?\n\nYou could stay in the AHCCCS CARE program.\n\nWhat if I can\u2019t find work?\n\nIf you meet the able-bodied adult definition, you could no longer use the AHCCCS program after a total of five years of coverage.\n\nWhat is this health-savings account all about?\n\nIt\u2019s intended to help build a \u201cpersonal safety net\u201d that an person can use for services not covered by AHCCCS. If someone gets a job and moves off AHCCCS, the money in the account goes with the individual and can be used for other health-related expenses.\n\nWho is NOT affected by this?\n\nChildren, the elderly, single parents caring for children age 6 or younger, the seriously mentally ill, those on disability and pregnant women. Of the 1.7 million Arizonans currently on AHCCCS, this would affect up to 350,000 people, or less than 25 percent.\n\nWould doctors and hospitals have to collect the copays?\n\nNo. AHCCCS would be responsible for this. There should be no change to what health-care providers do.\n\nHow much money would this save the state?\n\nDucey\u2019s staff says it has not calculated the amount yet.\n\nWhat are the chances of this happening?\n\nMuch of it will depend on federal approval. The federal government has never approved a lifetime limit on health coverage. But Ducey\u2019s staff say other elements of the plan, such as small copays, have been approved in other states\u2019 plans.\n\nOther aspects, such as development of a smartphone app to help AHCCCS clients stay on top of their health issues, will happen next year, regardless of what the federal government does.\n\nHow do I learn more?\n\nThere is a fact sheet online here.\n\nAHCCCS will be hosting community forums, starting with two in Phoenix on Aug. 18. Details are here.\n\nReach the reporter at maryjo.pitzl@arizonarepublic.com or at 602-444-8963.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://azc.cc/1SF9Vcd", "article_metadata": {"google": "notranslate", "description": "Gov.
