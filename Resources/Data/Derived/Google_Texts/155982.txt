WASHINGTON — Tea party activist Katrina Pierson, Rep. Pete Sessions’ Republican primary challenger, is running to his right on promises to slash spending.

But a recent financial disclosure shows she has been the beneficiary of a social safety net program, receiving more than $11,000 in unemployment insurance from the Texas Workforce Commission not long before she began running for Congress.

“Not sure what the scandal is here,” she told the Austin news website Quorum Report, which first reported the payments Sunday. “A single mom getting child support loses her job because of Obamacare and had unemployment.”

It’s unclear exactly when she received those payments but it was sometime from January 2012 to November 2013, the period covered by her mandatory candidate disclosure form.

Texas allows up to 26 weeks of unemployment benefits.

Pierson’s LinkedIn profile shows she worked at Florida-based ASG Software Solutions until December 2012, and opened a consulting firm in June 2013. Throughout the period covered by the disclosure form, she also lists work as a radio talk show host and as a political commentator for WFAA-TV.

It is unclear whether she received pay for those gigs. She did not respond to requests for details Monday.

ASG did not respond to calls to confirm whether it laid off anyone because of potential costs under the Affordable Care Act. A few weeks before the 2012 elections, owner David Siegel, a Florida billionaire, warned employees by email that he would have to consider layoffs if President Barack Obama were re-elected.

In June and July of last year, Pierson traveled to Washington for two tea party rallies. It’s unclear whether she was collecting unemployment payments at the time.
