That\u2019s reality for one in three North Texans, and that\u2019s what just happened to Natalie Berquist.\n\nThe single mom living in Lewisville is one of the people we\u2019re following in our series One Crisis Away. Natalie has a steady job, but because of a new monthly bill, she\u2019s giving up her apartment.\n\nThe KERA radio story\n\nWhen we introduced Natalie in December, she was living in a mostly empty apartment with her 4-year-old son Samuel.\n\nAfter a brief layoff just over a year ago, Natalie spent eight months in transitional housing. And after moving into the apartment, she said she\u2019d rather sink money into savings than buy a sofa.\n\nBut now, her apartment\u2019s even emptier. That\u2019s because she\u2019s moving out on Jan. 26.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very hard choice, do I put a roof over my head? Or do I have insurance and go to a shelter?\u201d Natalie wonders.\n\nA court agreement with Sam\u2019s father requires Natalie to buy health insurance for their child.\n\nHere\u2019s what Natalie tried. First, she applied for assistance from programs like Medicaid and CHIP, the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program. Both those applications were denied.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t work out, you need help those people like myself who are working, don\u2019t get it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m working, I\u2019m productive, I\u2019m paying taxes, I\u2019m doing everything I\u2019m supposed to, but still, there\u2019s zero help.\u201d\n\nThen, Natalie looked into coverage under the Affordable Care Act. She, like a lot of people, had trouble with the website and her employer does offer insurance. Because she was up against an enrollment deadline at work, that\u2019s the policy she chose. But she says the monthly premium is more than she can afford.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s $400. Even lowering my apartment rent and going to the smallest apartment here was not going to work. It still left me short paying food, electric, gas and phone,\u201d Natalie says.\n\nAnd because she can\u2019t go without any of that, in order to buy insurance, Natalie has to let her apartment go.\n\nShe applied for beds at a local shelter and was denied, but her brother agreed to let her and Samuel share a room in his house for a small, monthly rent.\n\n\u201cI just feel like somebody punched me in my stomach,\" she says. \"It\u2019s just such a sickening feeling to know that kind of like everything I had worked for and got to this point, it seems like it has gone down the drain.\"\n\nNatalie is happy she\u2019ll be able to save money by bunking with her brother, but she\u2019s worried moving for the second time in less than a year will be hard on her little guy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m grateful I don\u2019t have to go back to the shelter I guess, that\u2019s been very tough for Samuel, he doesn\u2019t understand that,\u201d she worries. \u201cWhy are we losing our house? I mean he was 3 years old and knew that last time, and I mean here he is 4-and-a-half.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s that same 4-and-a-half-year-old dynamo, a kid who cracks himself up playing tricks on his kitten, who motivates Natalie to keep going. Even when things look bleak, even when she\u2019s stuffing clothes and toys into garbage bags so she can move her little family yet again, Natalie says she has to persevere.\n\n\u201cYou have to hope, you have to dream you have to know and believe that there is going to be something better and reach for it,\u201d Natalie says. \u201cBecause if you don\u2019t have any dreams and hopes and you don\u2019t reach for something else, you\u2019re going to stay in the same spot and you don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d\n\nAnd Natalie admits, sometimes to move forward, you have to take a step back.\n\nWatch Natalie and Samuel getting ready to move:", "article_metadata": {"category": "Business/Economy", "description": "When you don\u2019t have a decent savings account or wiggle room in your budget, sometimes all it takes is an expense you haven\u2019t planned for to push you over", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "programs": "none", "og": {"url": "http://keranews.org/post/sickening-feeling-pushed-closer-edge-single-mother-moving-out", "image": "http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/kera/files/styles/medium/public/201401/Natalie_for_web_fixed.jpg", "type": "article", "description": "When you don\u2019t have a decent savings account or wiggle room in your budget, sometimes all it takes is an expense you haven\u2019t planned for to push you over", "title": "'A Sickening Feeling:' Pushed Closer To The Edge, A Single Mother Is Moving Out"}, "story_id": 264853218, "twitter": {"site": "@keranews", "card": "summary", "creator": "@courtneylc82"}, "author": "Courtney Collins", "org_id": 0, "dc": {"title": "&#039;A Sickening Feeling:&#039; Pushed Closer To The Edge, A Single Mother Is Moving Out"}, "nid": 44203, "datePublished": "2014-01-22", "keywords": ", , , ,", "wordCount": 754, "has_audio": 1, "viewport": "width=device-width"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcf487\"", "article_summary": "Because she was up against an enrollment deadline at work, that\u2019s the policy she chose.\nAnd because she can\u2019t go without any of that, in order to buy insurance, Natalie has to let her apartment go.\n\u201cI\u2019m working, I\u2019m productive, I\u2019m paying taxes, I\u2019m doing everything I\u2019m supposed to, but still, there\u2019s zero help.\u201dThen, Natalie looked into coverage under the Affordable Care Act.\nOr do I have insurance and go to a shelter?\u201d Natalie wonders.\nEven lowering my apartment rent and going to the smallest apartment here was not going to work."}
