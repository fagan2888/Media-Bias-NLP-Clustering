There will be a Tough Mudder event close to Sarasota Nov. 2-3 for all you extreme obstacle-course junkies. The race is 10-12 miles long and includes crawling through waist-deep mud and under barbed wire, being zapped by electric voltage, jumping in very cold water and through fire and carrying or throwing heavy items. The cost ranges from $60 to $200 (depending on when you register).

It's being held in Central Florida at Westgate River Ranch in River Ranch, Florida.

Although popular, the race has been in the news recently in a negative spotlight.

The death of a participant in April at a popular obstacle-course style race has many questioning safety at these events. Avishek Sengupta, 28, died April 20 while competing in a Tough Mudder race in West Virginia. He was found unresponsive with no pulse at the bottom of a chilly pool of mud and water after jumping off a plank 15 feet high - one of the event's challenges. It was the first death in Tough Mudder's three-year history.

Last year, 460,000-plus people participated in Tough Mudder events. This year, the projection is 500,000-plus.
