Bernie Sanders (I-VT) shows no signs of waning any time soon, much to Hillary Clinton\u2019s chagrin.\n\nA CBS News poll, conducted with YouGuv, released on Sunday found Sanders has become the Democratic frontrunner among likely presidential voters in the crucial states of New Hampshire and Iowa.\n\nRelated: Surprised Bernie Sanders Is Leading the Polls? So Is He\n\nIn the Granite State, Sanders holds a commanding 22-point lead over the former secretary of state, garnering 52 percent support to Clinton\u2019s 30 percent. In Iowa, those who claim they will participate in the state\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucus prefer Sanders 43 percent to 33 percent.\n\nBut Clinton easily outruns the more liberal Sanders in South Carolina, 46 percent compared to the senator\u2019s 23 percent.\n\nHowever, Sanders trumps Clinton when it comes to overall voter excitement. Seventy-eight percent of those polled express \u201centhusiastic support\u201d for the self-described democratic socialist, while Clinton only received half that amount, 39 percent.\n\nEarlier this week, Sanders said he was \u201cstunned\u201d by his surge in the polls and surprised that his campaign\u2019s focus on wage inequality and other pocket-book issues had resonated so quickly with voters.\n\nRelated: With Rick Perry Out, the Culling of the GOP Herd Begins\u2014Here\u2019s Who\u2019s Next\n\nOn Sunday, he struck a more confident tone, blaming Democrats for GOP gains in the 2014-midterm elections, saying voters who make up the party\u2019s base are \u201cdemoralized\u201d and decided to stay home on Election Day.\n\nSanders vowed to reverse that trend if he becomes the Democratic standard-bearer and gets other candidates to ride his coattails.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans did not win last November. The Democrats lost because a lot of their supporters are demoralized,\u201d he said during an interview on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press.\n\n\u201cI think we can strike an excitement in those groups of people, increase voter turnout, not only win the White House, but regain control over the Senate and do well in the House,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nRelated: Surprise--Hillary Clinton\u2019s Server Was Never \u201cWiped\u201d\n\nHe sought to burnish his bipartisan credentials and pointed to his role last year as chair of the Senate Veterans\u2019 Affairs Committee in getting a multi-billion overhaul of the Veterans Affairs Department\u2019s scandal-plagued medical network.\n\nSanders also took a shot at Republicans, chastising the GOP for \u201cwar talk\u201d when it comes to the volatile security situation in Iraq and Syria.\n\nVice President Biden, who is still mulling a run for the Democratic presidential nomination, places third in all three states, with 10 percent in Iowa, 9 percent in New Hampshire and 22 percent in South Carolina.\n\nThe YouGov/CBS News 2016 Battleground Tracker poll was conducted Sept. 3-10 and surveyed 548 likely Democratic primary voters in New Hampshire, 528 in South Carolina, and 646 in Iowa. The survey\u2019s margin of error is 5 percent.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "A new poll shows that enthusiasm among Democrats for Sen.
