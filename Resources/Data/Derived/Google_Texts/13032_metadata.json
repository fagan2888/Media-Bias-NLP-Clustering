(CBS4) \u2013 Jim Benemann was in Washington, D.C. Wednesday where he interviewed President Barack Obama about health care.\n\nThe deadline for Coloradans to sign up for health insurance if they don\u2019t already have it is Jan. 31. The statewide health care exchange Connect for Health Colorado is running ahead of last year\u2019s pace in getting customers enrolled.\n\nBut Obama and some key staff members weren\u2019t shy about pointing out that Colorado and Denver in particular are lagging behind other big cities in terms of getting people signed up by the deadline.\n\nObama knows cost is always a concern, especially for those living in Colorado\u2019s high country, which have some of the highest Obamacare premiums in the country. Part of the reason is so few insurance companies offer plans in those regions.\n\nWhen asked what he tells those people, the president responded, \u201cObviously with expansions of Medicaid we try to reach as many people as possible. There\u2019s no doubt that in some rural pockets it\u2019s always been tough to get health insurance because there aren\u2019t as many providers there and not enough density. Overall, since the Affordable Care Act passed, 18 million people have insurance who didn\u2019t have it before. In Colorado and places like Denver, seven out of 10 are going to get health insurance for less than their cellphone bill.\u201d\n\nThere are tax subsidies to help pay premiums for families earning up to $97,000 a year and individuals making up to $47,000 a year.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re hoping that Denver can step up, take a look and see if in fact it is affordable. I think often times they will be surprised by how affordable it is. It\u2019s high-quality care, gives you preventive care, gives you the kind of financial security that you\u2019re looking for and you\u2019ve got until Jan. 31 to get it done,\u201d said Obama.\n\nObama concedes there will always be room to improve the massive Affordable Care Act. But for now, not getting signed up will mean a fine coming tax time \u2014 $695 for individuals and $2,000 for a family of four.\n\nLINK: Connect For Health Colorado\n\nObama says too many people in too many cities haven\u2019t enrolled.\n\nBut Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell says health care inflation has at least slowed under Obamacare. She says it\u2019s providing most enrollees better coverage than they had before, if they had any at all.\n\n\u201cEssential health benefits that include everything from maternity coverage, which sometimes wasn\u2019t included, to things like behavioral or mental health issues,\u201d Burwell said. \u201cThese are very important issues.\u201d\n\nBenemann asked the president for two things he would do to make Obamacare better.\n\n\u201cOne thing we would do is just have all 50 states expand Medicaid, because the design of the program was to have private insurance for working families; but for some families who just can\u2019t afford it even with the tax subsidy, make sure the Medicaid is covered,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe could probably sign up about four million more people if we did that.\n\n\u201cThe second thing that I think we could probably do a better job of is for those small businesses who are providing health insurance and doing the right thing by their employees, but often times have small pools so they can\u2019t negotiate as good of prices; we think that we could probably do more to help them.\u201d\n\nColorado U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner reacted to the interview saying Obamacare needs to be repealed and replaced.\n\nMore From CBS4\u2019s Visit To The White House\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Benemann also attended a briefing with White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.\n\nCBS4 Executive Producer Jeff Gurney tweeted a picture of the White House briefing room.\n\nWorking in the White House Briefing room https://t.co/1MHcSSqXB6\u2014\n\nJeff Gurney (@JefGurney) January 27, 2016\n\nAnd another of Benemann working in the map room of the White House.\n\nJim Benemann working in the Map Room of the White House pic.twitter.com/OKFZnfP3Tz \u2014 Jeff Gurney (@JefGurney) January 27, 2016\n\nBenemann interviewed Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell while at the White House.\n\nJim Benemann is interviewing Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell pic.twitter.com/0YzSAz2uyf \u2014 Jeff Gurney (@JefGurney) January 27, 2016\n\nWhen Benemann and Gurney arrived at the White House, they were assigned an escort to guide them through their day.
