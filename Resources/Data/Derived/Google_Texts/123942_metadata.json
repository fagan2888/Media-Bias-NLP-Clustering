Last month a married couple fatally shot 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in an attack inspired by Islamic State.\n\nThose concerns have led to calls by some Republican governors and presidential hopefuls to restrict the admission of Syrian refugees fleeing that country's long civil war.\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, a Democrat sworn in on Monday, said after the shooting he did not believe Archer's actions reflected Islamic thinking.\n\n\"In no way, shape or form does anyone in this room believe that what was done represents Islam,\" Kenney said. \"This was done by a criminal with a stolen gun.\"\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations, the leading U.S. Muslim advocacy group, on Friday said Archer \"does not appear\" to be an observant Muslim.\n\nAt the Masjid Mujahideen mosque, which stands around the block from the home where Archer was believed to have lived, Imam Asim Abdur-Rashid said he did not know Archer and was not aware if he had ever prayed there.\n\n(Reporting by Brendan O'Brien; Editing by Frank McGurty and Clarence Fernandez)", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Edward Archer, of Philadelphia, is accused of ambushing an officer in his squad car sh", "title": "Suspect charged in shooting of Philadelphia policeman: prosecutor", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/08/Man-who-shot-Philadelphia-police-officer-cited-Islam-motive-official", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pennsylvania-police_1.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/latestnews/2016/01/08/Man-who-shot-Philadelphia-police-officer-cited-Islam-motive-official", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/reuters/pennsylvania-police_1.jpg", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Edward Archer, of Philadelphia, is accused of ambushing an officer in his squad car sh", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Last month a married couple fatally shot 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in an attack inspired by Islamic State.\nThe city's police commissioner said on Friday that Archer told authorities he ambushed the patrol car \"in the name of Islam.\"\nA top U.S. Muslim advocacy group said it had found no evidence that Archer was an observant Muslim.\nIn November, gunman and suicide bombers affiliated with Islamic State killed 130 people in a series of attacks in Paris.\nEdward Archer, of Philadelphia, is accused of ambushing an officer in his squad car shortly before midnight on Thursday."}
