In the midst of so much that was grown-up and responsible\u2014deadlines, campaigns, movements, scholarly undertakings, motherhood\u2014some crucial late-night part of the ongoing mental churning regressed back to the events of my adolescence, which were just too strange, and I wish there were a better word, to be permanently buried under the label of \u201cmental illness\u201d or some kind of temporary perceptual slippage. \u201cIf you see something, say something,\u201d as we are urged in train stations today, and certainly I had seen something. Yes, it was something inexplicable and anomalous, something that seemed, in a way I could not define, to be almost alive. But this had also been the case with the oscillations at the silicon electrode, and it was still my responsibility to report them and bear the shame, if necessary, of bringing unwelcome, perhaps even incomprehensible news.\n\nThe circumstances of my return were not auspicious. The movement that had sustained me for more than a decade was crumbling under my feet. As my former comrades drifted away, to careers or, in a few cases, cults or prison, I could no longer imagine myself as a warrior. I was at best a soldier, sticking doggedly to the project of \u201csocial change\u201d even when that meant serving in the most tediously compromised fragments of the left, where the idea was no longer to ignite the \u201cmasses\u201d but to flatter, and thereby hopefully influence, people who were more influential than we were. More and more of my time was devoted to the feminist movement, but it too was often mired in useless discussion, such as attempts to determine our \u201cprinciples of unity.\u201d I got through the long meetings\u2014often weekend-long meetings in windowless conference rooms\u2014by trying to work out the prime numbers up to 200.\n\nMeanwhile, my father succumbed to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which replaced that brilliant and complicated man with a partially melted wax effigy whose speech was increasingly limited to random word-sounds and chirps. Or maybe it was the nursing homes, as well as the Alzheimer\u2019s, that worked this change in him, because if you take away all printed matter, occupation, and conversation, you will eventually get someone who kneels by the toilet to stir his feces with a plastic spoon, or so it has been my misfortune to observe.\n\nEvery few weeks I would fly to Denver to visit him, each trip a journey into the unbearable ugliness that humans manage to secrete around themselves out of plastic and metal and short-haired, easy-to-clean carpeting material: the airport, the interior of the airplane, the corporate chain hotel, predictable down to the free cookie offered to each arriving guest. And then there was the nursing home itself. Was I depressed because my father was dying or already dead, depending on how you evaluate these things, or because I had to spend so many hours in a place that made death seem like the best remaining option, if not something to be urgently desired? Moss green and salmon, no doubt thought to be an inoffensive, gender-neutral combination, made up the color scheme, except for the posters serving to remind us of the season\u2014lambs and flowers in the spring, pumpkins in the fall, snowflakes in their proper time. And we needed those reminders, because fresh air was not allowed inside the nursing home, only air freshener.\n\nEarlier, when things were going well, when the movement was thriving and before my father became a shell or my children turned into teenagers, bent on individuating themselves from me as if I represented a potentially contagious condition, I could handle a world without transcendence or even the memory of transcendence. But in addition to everything else, my second husband, who I can say in retrospect was the big love of my life, got eaten alive by his sixteen-hour-a-day job as a union organizer and began to act like one possessed. I had been his eager helpmate\u2014marching in picket lines, going to organizing meetings, welcoming insurgent truck drivers, factory workers, and janitors into our appropriately modest home\u2014but now he was too preoccupied to reliably hear me when I spoke or notice when I entered a room. With my human environment falling apart, the repressed began its inevitable return.\n\nThe story of the years leading up to my return to the old questions can best be summarized as a series of measurements and chemical assays: the increase in amyloid protein in my father\u2019s brain and the corresponding decline of serotonin in my own; the uncertain tides of estrogen and oxytocin, the diurnal rise and fall of blood alcohol, caffeine, and sugar levels. Simmer all this together for many months and you get a potent toxin, which seemed to come at me in waves. I can remember the luncheon hosted by a countywide women\u2019s organization, probably on a Saturday afternoon in late February. All very jolly and heartwarming, until I happened to look out the window of the Long Island catering hall where we were gathered and saw the imminent menace. There was a gas station and an intersection under a pearly gray sky peppered with factory emissions; there was a parking lot mired with the black remains of snow; there was no hope. The award ceremony itself was a mockery, because anyone could see that the people presiding over it were dying right in front of us, if not actually dead, and that rigor mortis had already hardened their smiles into grimaces. And I was not a passive or reluctant participant in this event. I was the one who got the award.\n\nThe name for my condition, I discovered, was \u201cdepression,\u201d which I learned from a 1989 op-ed column William Styron wrote about Primo Levi\u2019s suicide. What surprised me was the term, \u201cdepression,\u201d which seemed far too languid to apply\u2014an insipid \u201cwimp of a word,\u201d as Styron himself put it, for \u201ca dreadful and raging disease.\u201d I went along with the diagnosis, therapy, and medications, but not without internal reservations. You can talk about depression as a \u201cchemical imbalance\u201d all you want, but it presents itself as an external antagonist\u2014a \u201cdemon,\u201d a \u201cbeast,\u201d or a \u201cblack dog,\u201d as Samuel Johnson called it. It could pounce at any time, even in the most innocuous setting, like that award luncheon or in a parking lot where I waited one evening to pick up my daughter from a school trip. What if her school bus failed to return? What if it had crashed somewhere? Even when I had her safely in the car, it was all I could do to get us home and rush into the bathroom for a fit of gagging and trembling over how close the beast was getting.\n\nIt was despair that pulled me back, as a mature adult, to the ancient, childish quest. I could not go on the way I had been, dragging the huge weight of my unfinished project. The constant vigilance imposed by motherhood, along with the pressure to get assignments and meet deadlines, had trapped me in the world of consensual reality\u2014the accepted symbols and meanings, the highways and malls, meetings and conferences, supermarkets and school functions. I seemed to have lost the ability to dissociate, to look beneath the surface and ask the old question, which is, in the simplest terms, What is actually going on here?\n\nOr maybe depression in its demon form awoke me to the long-buried possibility that there exist other beings, agents, forces than those that are visible and agreed upon. I wish I could draw some clear lines of causality here, but there are no primary sources to refer to, no journal or even any random notes to my future self.\n\nBut when I did try to return to the old questions, very furtively of course, despair and a kind of shame followed me and blocked the way. The impasse was this: If I let myself speculate even tentatively about that something, if I acknowledged the possibility of a nonhuman agent or agents, some mysterious Other, intervening in my life, could I still call myself an atheist? In my public life as a writer and a speaker, I had always been a reliably \u201cout\u201d atheist. This was my parents\u2019 legacy, and a deeper part of my identity than incidentals like nationality or even class. At some point in the eighties I published an essay-length history of American atheism that unearthed the stream of working-class atheism from which I was descended. I won awards and recognition from organizations of \u201cfreethinkers\u201d and humanists. When the subject came up, which it was bound to in our largely Catholic blue-collar neighborhood, I told my children that there is no God, no good and loving God anyway, which is why we humans have to do our best to help and care for each other. Morality, as far as I could see, originates in atheism and the realization that no higher power is coming along to feed the hungry or lift the fallen. Mercy is left entirely to us.", "article_metadata": {"description": "My scornful atheism slowly disappeared -- but not my sense that human freedom depends on being free from spirits", "title": "Barbara Ehrenreich: My search for truth as a non-believer", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "My scornful atheism slowly disappeared -- but not my sense that human freedom depends on being free from spirits", "title": "Barbara Ehrenreich: My search for truth as a non-believer", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2014/04/12/barbara_ehrenreich_my_search_for_truth_as_a_non_believer/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/barbara_ehrenreich2.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "My scornful atheism slowly disappeared -- but not my sense that human freedom depends on being free from spirits", "title": "Barbara Ehrenreich: My search for truth as a non-believer", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2014/04/barbara_ehrenreich2.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Barbara Ehrenreich", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=549374205, app-argument=http://www.salon.com/", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 456294607741273}, "keywords": "Salon.com, Atheism, Books, Editor's Picks, Living with a wild god, Religion, Science", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fcdf38\"", "article_summary": "\u201cIf you see something, say something,\u201d as we are urged in train stations today, and certainly I had seen something.\nYes, it was something inexplicable and anomalous, something that seemed, in a way I could not define, to be almost alive.\nThis was my parents\u2019 legacy, and a deeper part of my identity than incidentals like nationality or even class.\nThe movement that had sustained me for more than a decade was crumbling under my feet.\nAnd we needed those reminders, because fresh air was not allowed inside the nursing home, only air freshener."}
