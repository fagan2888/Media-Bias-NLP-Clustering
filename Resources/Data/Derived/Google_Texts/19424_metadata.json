For low-income families, especially older people living on a fixed income, this can lead to breaking the family budget \u2013 or exposure to excessive heat.\n\nOne way to avoid high utility bills is to make homes more energy efficient. That is the goal of the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP), a federal program designed to increase energy efficiency for low-income families. The Weatherization Assistance Program targets services toward households hardest hit by high utility costs and most vulnerable to ill effects from high and fluctuating utility expenditures.\n\nWhen home systems and appliances use less energy to provide services, families are better protected from extreme heat and cold. In addition, more affordable energy makes housing more affordable, reducing homelessness and lowering dependence on energy and other public assistance.\n\nWAP has had significant success, according to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), which estimates that home weatherization reduces annual energy costs for all fuels by an average of $437 per household, and reduces bills for natural gas heating by an average of 32 percent. The Department of Energy estimates that the program has weatherized over 7 million homes since 1976.\n\nWAP Benefits Families, the Economy and the Environment\n\nLow-income households receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or those with older residents, young children, persons with disabilities as well as those paying a high share of income for energy, are eligible for WAP benefits. DOE defines \u201clow income\u201d as household income at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty income guidelines.\n\n\n\nWhat Does WAP Do?\n\nWeatherization addresses energy loss caused by building structural design, heating and cooling systems, and electrical systems including appliances. Typical measures include installing insulation, sealing ducts, and tuning, repairing and testing heating and cooling systems.\n\nHow Is WAP Funded?\n\nWAP is funded primarily through annual congressional appropriations managed and allocated by the Department of Energy. The WAP program distributes grants to states and territories, which in turn grant funds to community-based nonprofits or local governement agencies with expertise in delivering program services.\n\nStates often combine the Department of Energy\u2019s WAP allocations with other federal, state, local, utility and private funds to weatherize houses. These other sources include U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) funds, and funds from utility companies, state governments and property owner contributions. Additional funds, which vary from state to state and year to year, can constitute a significant portion of a state\u2019s funding for low-income weatherization.\n\nWAP and the American Recovery and Reivestment Act (ARRA)\n\nWAP\u2019s dual focus on moving toward a reduced-carbon economy and investing in small businesses made it a good fit for the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). That legislation appropriated $5 billion for WAP over three years, a twentyfold increase over FY 2008 \u2013 which helped WAP exceed the administration\u2019s goal of weatherizing 634,956 low-income homes by nearly 25 percent.\n\nAnn McLarty Jackson works on low-income utility issues and issues of diverse access to financial institutions and other services and supports. She has written reports on federal and state utility assistance, winter heating and summer cooling costs for older populations, and access to financial institutions by diverse populations.", "article_metadata": {"page_title": "blog", "twitter": {"description": "Staying cool in the summer costs most of us more these days as electricity prices rise.
