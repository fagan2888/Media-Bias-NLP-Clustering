These funds from the federal government will subsidize Windstream\u2019s expenses so it can avoid charging rural area customers more for services.\n\nIn total, this support from the FCC will allow Windstream to deliver broadband to approximately 44,930 homes and businesses in Iowa.\n\nAs for broadband access, Rick Sanders, chair of the Story County Board of Supervisors, said there are few areas left in the county without access.\n\n\u201cI think Story County is almost 100 percent covered now,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nEarlier this year, the county received a Connected Community certificate from Connect Iowa to celebrate the county\u2019s progress in expanding high-speed Internet to residents. Story County residents are served by 26 broadband providers, including Windstream.\n\n\u201cIt is how we live today,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI don\u2019t see technology going away \u2026 It is a fundamental component of our daily lives.\u201d\n\nAlthough most of the county has access to broadband, Sanders said the goal moving forward is ensuring the county has access to high-quality Internet.\n\n\u201cWe need to be on the cutting edge,\u201d he said, noting that having high-speed Internet will be necessary for the work being done at Iowa State University, along with the increase in farming equipment that uses broadband.\n\n\u201cWe need to be near the top in what is happening across the nation,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nAccording to the FCC, the benchmark for broadband speed is 25 megabits per second for downloads. The services provided by Windstream will be at speeds of at least 10 megabits per second.\n\nState Rep. Lisa Heddens, of Ames, said the bill the state Legislature passed this past session defines high-speed Internet based off the FCC standard.\n\n\u201cWe are connected more,\u201d Heddens said. \u201cIn the 21st century, (we need) more and more accessibility to broadband.\u201d\n\nThe law creates a property tax relief program for high-speed Internet providers, specifically targeting rural businesses and communities.\n\nHeddens said it is important to have the capability to provide for the high-speed Internet needs of Iowa businesses, allowing them to compete in the national and global market.\n\n\u201cA lot of them, this is how they are communicating and connecting,\u201d Heddens said.\n\nThe federal money awarded to Windstream to be used in Story County is specifically funded through the Connect America Fund, with the goal to \u201censure all Americans have access to robust, affordable broadband.\u201d Windstream is headquartered in Little Rock, Ark.", "article_metadata": {"description": "The Federal Communications Commission announced this week it is awarding Windstream Communications $28.7 million in ongoing annual support to expand and support broadband in rural Iowa, of which more than $5.5 million will be used in Story County over the next six years.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarina Rhinehart Staff Writer srhinehart@amestrib.com", "og": {"site_name": "Ames Tribune", "description": "The Federal Communications Commission announced this week it is awarding Windstream Communications $28.7 million in ongoing annual support to expand and support broadband in rural Iowa, of which more than $5.5 million will be used in Story County over the next six years.", "title": "Windstream Communications awards $5.5M to support broadband in Story County", "url": "http://amestrib.com/news/windstream-communications-awards-55m-support-broadband-story-county", "image": "http://amestrib.com/sites/amestrib.com/smtheme/_img/site-logo.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://amestrib.com/news/windstream-communications-awards-55m-support-broadband-story-county", "title": "Windstream Communications awards $5.5M to support broadband in Story County", "description": "The Federal Communications Commission announced this week it is awarding Windstream Communications $28.7 million in ongoing annual support to expand and support broadband in rural Iowa, of which more than $5.5 million will be used in Story County over the next six years.", "creator": "@AmesTribNews"}, "al": {"web": {"should_fallback": "true"}, "android": {"url": "ames-tribune://?eid=1213595", "app_name": "ames-tribune", "package": "com.stephensmedia.amestribune"}, "ios": {"url": "ames-tribune://?eid=1213595", "app_store_id": 552175169, "app_name": "ames-tribune"}}, "keywords": "News,Ames and Story County,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-08-08T07:53:11-05:00"}, "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=0.9"}, "article_summary": "In total, this support from the FCC will allow Windstream to deliver broadband to approximately 44,930 homes and businesses in Iowa.\nThe Federal Communications Commission announced this week it is awarding Windstream Communications $28.7 million in ongoing annual support to expand and support broadband in rural Iowa, of which more than $5.5 million will be used in Story County over the next six years.\nAs for broadband access, Rick Sanders, chair of the Story County Board of Supervisors, said there are few areas left in the county without access.\nThe federal money awarded to Windstream to be used in Story County is specifically funded through the Connect America Fund, with the goal to \u201censure all Americans have access to robust, affordable broadband.\u201d Windstream is headquartered in Little Rock, Ark.\nStory County residents are served by 26 broadband providers, including Windstream."}
