Letcher, SD

A South Dakota shop has built a scaled-down stagecoach that will soon be used by children visiting a safari park in Japan.



Craftsmen at Hansen Wheel and Wagon Shop in Letcher spent about a year building the stagecoach for the Fuji Safari Park.



Shop owner Doug Hansen tells The Daily Republic that the park has an Old West-themed area where children will ride the stagecoach, which four miniature ponies will pull around. The stagecoach is currently on a 30-day journey in ship until it reaches Japan.



The stagecoach was primarily used to haul mail around the vast West. Some also hauled passengers.



Hansen's company has been building vehicles of the American West for over 35 years. Hansen says the company ships about half a dozen vehicles overseas every year.
