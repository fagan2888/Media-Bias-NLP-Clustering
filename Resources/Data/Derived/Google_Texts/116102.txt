ATLANTA (AP) - Authorities say Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport has returned to normal operations after a winter storm prompted delays on Wednesday.

The flight tracking service FlightAware early Thursday morning showed no arrival or departure delays at the world’s busiest airport.

Federal Aviation Administration officials say a ground delay was in effect at the airport Wednesday evening as snow and rain moved through north Georgia.

FAA officials say a ground delay means flights that have been held because of severe weather may not depart from Atlanta until they’re given clearance. Officials say the delay times are calculated to ensure a steady flow of air traffic.
