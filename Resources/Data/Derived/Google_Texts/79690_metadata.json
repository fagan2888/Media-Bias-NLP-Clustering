Jeb Bush (R) is declaring that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold ObamaCare last week is \u201cnot the end of the fight\u201d against the healthcare law.\n\nBush, one of the GOP\u2019s frontrunners for 2016, on Monday offered a new glimpse into his plan to replace ObamaCare days after the court decision that further cemented the law\u2019s legacy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn a blog post on Medium, Bush pledged to \u201cempower states,\u201d offer \u201ctax relief\u201d to help people pay their premiums and give employers the chance to \u201coffer more innovative benefit designs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we should have employer mandates, employee mandates or healthcare mandates that make healthcare insurance so extraordinarily expensive,\u201d he said in a video.\n\nThe blog post marks his first public comments, beyond a short statement on Thursday, since the court ruled to uphold subsidies in the healthcare law in King v. Burwell.\n\nHis ideas \u2014 many of which are already popular within the Republican party \u2014 are just a few specifics in what will need to be a comprehensive replacement plan before the 2016 election.\n\nThe GOP\u2019s defeat in King v. Burwell last week puts more pressure on candidates to come up with plans to replace the law after President Obama leaves office.\n\nTop Republicans in Congress have cast the court decision as an opportunity for 2016 hopefuls to double down on their ObamaCare planning.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, we need to show the country what exactly we\u2019d replace this law with, so that when we win the election in 2016, we have the ability to do it in 2017,\u201d House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan Paul RyanPuerto Rico debt relief faces serious challenges in Senate Overnight Finance: GOP faces dilemma on spending bills | CEOs push Congress on tax rules | Trump talks energy Overnight Energy: Trump outlines 'America First' energy plan in North Dakota MORE (R-Wis.) said on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday.", "article_metadata": {"dcterms.description": "The 2016 hopeful speaks out against the employer and individual mandates.", "description": "The 2016 hopeful speaks out against the employer and individual mandates.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Sarah Ferris", "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "description": "The 2016 hopeful speaks out against the employer and individual mandates.", "title": "Jeb: Ruling is \u2018not the end of the fight\u2019 against ObamaCare", "url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/246426-jeb-bush-court-ruling-is-not-the-end-of-the-fight-against-obamacare", "image": "http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/bush_061515screengrab_0.jpg", "updated_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00", "type": "article"}, "dcterms.language": "und", "Smart_Paging": "on", "dcterms.modified": "2016-02-02T03:29-05:00", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/246426-jeb-bush-court-ruling-is-not-the-end-of-the-fight-against-obamacare", "dcterms.date": "2015-06-29T10:54-04:00", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "dcterms.creator": "Sarah Ferris", "dcterms.type": "Text", "keywords": ",Paul Ryan,", "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-29T10:54:24-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-02-02T03:29:10-05:00"}, "dcterms.format": "text/html", "twitter": {"url": "http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/246426-jeb-bush-court-ruling-is-not-the-end-of-the-fight-against-obamacare", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "description": "The 2016 hopeful speaks out against the employer and individual mandates.", "card": "summary", "title": "Jeb: Ruling is \u2018not the end of the fight\u2019 against ObamaCare"}, "dcterms.title": "Jeb: Ruling is \u2018not the end of the fight\u2019 against ObamaCare"}, "article_summary": "Jeb Bush (R) is declaring that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to uphold ObamaCare last week is \u201cnot the end of the fight\u201d against the healthcare law.\nTop Republicans in Congress have cast the court decision as an opportunity for 2016 hopefuls to double down on their ObamaCare planning.\nBush, one of the GOP\u2019s frontrunners for 2016, on Monday offered a new glimpse into his plan to replace ObamaCare days after the court decision that further cemented the law\u2019s legacy.\nThe blog post marks his first public comments, beyond a short statement on Thursday, since the court ruled to uphold subsidies in the healthcare law in King v.
