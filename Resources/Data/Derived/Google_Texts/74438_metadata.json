(WTVR) - Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe said the budget he proposed as the General Assembly started its special session Monday is based on the budget his Republican predecessor Governor Bob McDonnell proposed when the session began -- but with 104 amendments that \"reflect the Governor\u2019s priorities.\"\n\nAmong those priorities, using federal tax dollars to expand Medicaid coverage to more Virginians.\n\n\u201cThis budget is balanced and responsible, and it reflects the pressing urgency to take action to use our own tax dollars to cover up to 400,000 Virginia families over the next two years,\u201d Governor McAuliffe said. \u201cI am eager to get to work with Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate to find common ground so that we can end this stalemate, pass a budget and bring our federal dollars home to help 400,000 people access care that is essential to healthy and productive lives.\"\n\nSome Republican lawmakers are not convinced the Democratic-governor's plan is right for Virginia. If Virginia chooses to opt out of Medicaid expansion after only two years, thousands of Virginians could lose health coverage.\n\n\"Individuals would say 'I did not know this was going to happen. Here I am comfortable with my coverage and you're going to take it away,'\" State Senator Thomas Norment (R - James City County) said.\n\nUnder the governor's budget proposal, raises for state workers and new money for mental health programs, are directly tied to federal Medicaid dollars. The governor said he would take the heat if Medicaid expansion did not help Virginia.\n\n\"Let every camera have it clear, that it was the governor who will take full responsibility,\" Gov. McAuliffe said pointing to television cameras. \"So everybody else is off the hook.\"\n\nGovernor McAuliffe said he hoped state lawmakers would have a budget passed within the next three weeks.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Governor Terry McAuliffe's budget proposal is \"based on\" Bob McDonnell proposed budget -- but with 104 amendments.", "generator": "WordPress.com", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=572089813", "og": {"site_name": "WTVR.com", "description": "Governor Terry McAuliffe\u2019s budget proposal is \u201cbased on\u201d Bob McDonnell proposed budget \u2014 but with 104 amendments.", "title": "McAuliffe pledges to take \u2018full responsibility\u2019 if Medicaid expansion hurts Virginia", "url": "http://wtvr.com/2014/03/24/governor-mcauliffe-budget-proposal/", "image": {"width": 1200, "identifier": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/terry-mcauliffe1.jpg?w=1200", "height": 675}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"app": {"id": {"ipad": 572089813, "iphone": 572089813}}, "creator": "@cbs6", "image": {"src": "https://localtvwtvr.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/terry-mcauliffe1.jpg?w=640"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@cbs6"}, "keywords": "politics, terry mcauliffe", "p": {"domain_verify": "fc2caefd8163039c48c3b35b178e0993"}, "fb": {"pages": 6860957425}, "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "application-name": "WTVR.com", "google-site-verification": "xp-vKfdwBt7bllcG4eSrgb2mL-O45aD7dIeyF4EmMF8", "msvalidate.01": "9CC50DB4C5614EA88B5CFA75E33AAB02", "article": {"publisher": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr", "published_time": "2014-03-24T17:02:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-04-08T21:57:36+00:00", "author": "http://facebook.com/cbs6wtvr"}, "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://wtvr.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/1e5f8555355860d96f4528b85609455b?s=16"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd3b6e\"", "article_summary": "Among those priorities, using federal tax dollars to expand Medicaid coverage to more Virginians.\nUnder the governor's budget proposal, raises for state workers and new money for mental health programs, are directly tied to federal Medicaid dollars.\nGovernor McAuliffe said he hoped state lawmakers would have a budget passed within the next three weeks.\nIf Virginia chooses to opt out of Medicaid expansion after only two years, thousands of Virginians could lose health coverage.\nThe governor said he would take the heat if Medicaid expansion did not help Virginia."}
