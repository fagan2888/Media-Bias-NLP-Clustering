Wehby wins Oregon Senate nod\n\nPediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby defeated state Rep. Jason Conger in the Oregon Republican Senate primary on Tuesday and will challenge first-term Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley in the fall.\n\nThat will be an uphill battle for Wehby in the blue state \u2014 but her primary success is a triumph for party operatives who hope the recruit can appeal to moderate and female voters and, as a doctor, credibly criticize the Affordable Care Act and its troublesome rollout in Oregon.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nWehby drew 53 percent of the vote, compared to 34 percent for the more conservative Conger, with 54 percent of precincts reporting in the all-mail primary, The Associated Press said.\n\n( Full primary election results)\n\n\u201cDr. Wehby is an exciting candidate, a mom, and a pediatric neurosurgeon who has dedicated her life to healing children and has firsthand knowledge when it comes to Oregonians\u2019 health care needs,\u201d National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Jerry Moran in a statement. \u201cDemocrats are now on defense in Oregon.\u201d\n\nA political newcomer, Wehby enjoyed frontrunner status thanks to much stronger fundraising than Conger, endorsements from high-profile GOP leaders like Mitt Romney and the support of several independent-expenditure groups.\n\nThe race has already attracted more than $1 million in outside spending, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nBut Wehby\u2019s campaign was not without its challenges. News stories surfaced late in the race about harassment complaints against her in past relationships with her ex-husband and an ex-boyfriend.\n\n( WATCH: Primary victory speeches)\n\nHer campaign and a supportive super PAC also sustained scrutiny because the ex-boyfriend, lumber executive Andrew Miller, cut a five-figure check to the outside group that helped spur attacks on Conger, raising questions about improper coordination, which the parties denied.\n\nOn Tuesday, Wehby and Moran decried the motivations behind those stories. \u201cDr. Wehby\u2019s victory tonight sends a message that the ugly politics of personal destruction will not be tolerated in Oregon,\u201d Moran said.\n\nNow she\u2019ll face Merkley and national Democrats, who had already dismissed the Republican field as not viable in Oregon. Still, Merkley is directly engaging, and he\u2019s amassed a $3.7 million war chest for the fall. He had a 16- to 20-point lead on the Republicans in his own internal polling in April, though GOP pollsters suggest the race is closer.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Self-funder Wolf trounces Pa. governor field)\n\nAbout 25 percent of eligible voters had returned their primary ballots by Monday, according to the Oregon secretary of state\u2019s office.\n\nThere was no immediate word from Conger about whether he\u2019d support Wehby in the general election. He had expressed frustration with what he perceived as the NRSC\u2019s preference for her.\n\nHe said on MSNBC late Tuesday that he\u2019d made a \u201chuge mistake\u201d by simply trying to run a clean, issues-based campaign.\n\nKey dynamics to watch in the fall include President Barack Obama\u2019s job approval rating among Oregon voters, as well as attitudes about the president\u2019s signature health care law. Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber will be on the ballot, and voters may display their frustration with his role in the health law implementation, which could help Wehby.\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Insurgent GOP groups embrace McConnell)\n\nBut Democrats still have a significant registration and party infrastructure advantage.\n\n\u201cThe best hope for any Republican here is going to be that, for whatever reason, the national Democratic party and national administration become substantially unpopular with Oregon voters,\u201d said Portland-based pollster Tim Hibbits this week before the election.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "POLITICO", "description": "She faces an uphill battle in a blue state.", "title": "Wehby wins Oregon Senate nod", "url": "http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/oregon-senate-primary-2014-wehby-106927.html", "image": "http://s3-origin-images.politico.com/2014/05/21/140521_monica_wehby_primarywin_ap_328.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "type": "article"}, "keywords": "Oregon,Monica Wehby,2014 Elections,Jeff Merkley,2014 Senate Campaigns,Jason Conger", "twitter": {"site": "@politico", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico"}, "description": "She faces an uphill battle in a blue state.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "article_summary": "Wehby wins Oregon Senate nodPediatric neurosurgeon Monica Wehby defeated state Rep.
