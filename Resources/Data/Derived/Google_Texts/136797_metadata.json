Today his terrorist killer is lionized.\n\nOn February 21, 1969, Eddie Joffe, 21, and his best friend, Leon Kanner, stopped at an upscale grocery store in central Jerusalem. A recent immigrant and avid hiker who aspired to explore every mile of his new country, Eddie wanted to grab a few supplies for a foray in the nearby hills. But Palestinian terrorists had rigged a can of sweets with dynamite, leaving it on a shelf in the supermarket. The bomb detonated just as the two college students approached, killing both and injuring nine or ten other bystanders.\n\nEddie\u2019s little brother, Harold, 19, had to accompany his shocked parents and Israeli officials to identify the body, says Basil, the eldest Joffe son. \u201cI remember him telling me the body was so badly burned and blackened from the explosion that they could barely recognize it,\u201d Basil tells me. \u201cIt was a pretty devastating thing for Harold to have to endure. . . . The grief that my family, and especially my parents, experienced was immense. . . . When I arrived in Jerusalem, we all just held each other and wept. There\u2019s nothing that anybody could say. . . . My parents\u2019 lives were also devastated, definitely, and they never recovered until they died.\u201d\n\nForty-five years later, the woman convicted for her central role in the bombing that killed Joffe and Kanner is facing trial for immigration fraud in Detroit, Mich.\n\nThough Rasmieh Yousef Odeh was sentenced to life in prison in Israel for her role in the bombing, she was released after a decade as part of a prisoner swap. She allegedly lied on her immigration papers, moving to the United States, gaining prominence in Chicago as an activist for the Arab community, and eventually becoming a citizen. (As National Review Online reported earlier this year, she also worked as an Obamacare navigator.)\n\nThe Associated Press reported last week that Odeh may plead guilty at her court hearing today, which could result in her deportation but allow her to avoid years in an American prison for falsifying her immigration papers. The charges against Odeh have been vocally disputed by the Muslim community \u2014 including the Arab American Action Network (AAAN), which employs her as an associate director \u2014 and other groups in the region.\n\nBasil says that although he has lived in Houston for the past 35 years, he found out only last week that Odeh had moved to the United States and become an American citizen. That knowledge \u2014 as well as the fact that Odeh continues to receive public support, despite appearing unrepentant for her crimes \u2014 is deeply painful to the surviving Joffe family, Basil says.\n\nIn a news conference last year, Hatem Abudayyeh, AAAN\u2019s executive director, described Odeh as a women\u2019s-rights activist who \u201chas dedicated her whole life to social justice\u201d and \u201cwho has come under attack by federal law enforcement in this country.\u201d\n\nMargaret Jackson, the interim regional director of the American Friends Service Committee, voiced her support for Odeh and said, \u201cIt just infuriates me that this country continues to discriminate on color and religion and they\u2019re so desperate that they go back into the past to do that. . . . As an organization that is almost 100 years old and committed to non-violence, I\u2019m just appalled by this situation.\u201d\n\nOdeh\u2019s supporters have attended her court dates and started petitions online demanding that charges against her be dropped.\n\nBasil says he finds their advocacy for a terrorist deeply disturbing; \u201cI just about vomited\u201d when he listened to one of them, he says. Their claims that Odeh is the victim of political persecution and discrimination are particularly galling, he says.\n\n\u201cThat [would be] a perfectly legitimate problem for them to address, and very good for them \u2014 but what is unconscionable is that they could take in this woman, whom they now know \u2014 and maybe they didn\u2019t know in the beginning, but they certainly know now exactly what her past was \u2014 so how could they purport to prevent unfair discrimination and stereotyping when one of their [leaders] is a convicted terrorist, murdered people, and is unrepentant? It makes a hypocrisy, a mockery, of what they\u2019re trying to accomplish,\u201d Basil says.\n\nHe points out that in a 2004 documentary called Women in Struggle, Rasmieh Odeh and a woman named Ayesha Odeh (it\u2019s unclear whether the two are related or merely close friends) speak openly about their terroristic activities in Israel and appear to lack any regret about the crimes they committed.\n\nIn the documentary, Ayesha says that \u201cRasmieh Odeh was more involved than I was [in the grocery-store bombing]. . . . I only got involved during the preparation of explosives. We wanted to place two bombs to blow up consecutively. I suggested to have the second bomb go off five or six minutes after the first bomb so that those who get killed in it would be members of the army and secret service, but it did not explode. They defused it 20 seconds before it exploded.\u201d Rasmieh Odeh describes how time in an Israeli prison deepened her \u201chatred against those who were responsible. Why? I am not responsible, the occupation is.\u201d\n\nThough Odeh avoided her life sentence in Israel, Basil says that spending time in an American prison for immigration fraud would be \u201ca much more fitting punishment for her at this point\u201d than deportation alone. He says if Odeh is spared a prison sentence, he fears she will return to the Middle East to receive \u201ca hero\u2019s welcome.\u201d\n\nBasil adds that he\u2019s glad his parents aren\u2019t alive to witness Odeh\u2019s reemergence. Eddie\u2019s death haunted them all their lives, Basil says, recalling his brother as a cheerful, friendly young man whose absence was constantly and painfully felt by the family.\n\n\u201cMy brother was really athletic and strong,\u201d Basil says, \u201cbut he was also very well read and intelligent. He was at the start of his university career, so his life was really just starting out, and he was filled with exuberance and enthusiasm. On his gravestone, there\u2019s a quote that says: \u2018The spark of his life was snuffed out in Jerusalem by a hand of evil.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jillian Kay Melchior writes for National Review as a Thomas L.
