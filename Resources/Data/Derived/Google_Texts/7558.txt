A Spartanburg man has been accused of attacking another man with a machete.

Spartanburg police tell local media that 27-year-old Michael J. McCall was extremely intoxicated and wasn't wearing any pants Tuesday when officers found him fighting two other men.

The two men told police officers that McCall approached them and swung the machete, hitting one of the men in the mouth. Officers say the men then jumped on top of McCall to wrestle the blade away from him.

Upon arresting McCall, police say he kicked the rear doors and a camera in the car before breaking a radar unit in the car.

McCall has been charged with aggravated assault and battery, public disorderly conduct and malicious injury to real property. Online jail records do not indicate whether he has an attorney.
