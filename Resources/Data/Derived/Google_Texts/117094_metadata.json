Submitted photo.\n\nBLACKDUCK \u2014 After a major low point in 2009, Anderson Fabrics has stitched its way back as a leading employer in Blackduck and northern Minnesota.\n\nThe last time the 135,000-square-foot Anderson Fabric Workroom saw 325 employees was in 2006, during the housing boom. Following that, business went south during the Great Recession.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know if we would ever come back that strong,\u201d said Steve Cochems, president of Anderson Fabrics.\n\nThe workroom produces window treatments, bedding and accessories like ottomans, trunks, folding screens, table linens, table skirts and more.\n\nNow, the company just finished hiring around 30 people and will continue to hire throughout the year. Immediately, they hope to hire another 10 or 15 employees, according to Miriam Osborn, Human Resources manager.\n\n\u201cBecause the employees here did such a great job prior to the recession, and throughout the recession, in serving our customers both quality-wise and how quickly we get the product out to our customers, we\u2019ve built back very close to where we were back in 2006,\u201d Cochems said.\n\nSeasonal workers are also needed in the workroom and mainly for sewing, said Osborn. \u201cWe always welcome skilled sewers.\u201d\n\nPart of the challenge facing Anderson Fabrics was the lack of affordable housing during the recession. The company thrives off the single-family housing market, which isn\u2019t where it was in 2006, but is also up from its downfall in 2009.\n\nhiring and benefits\n\nWorkers at Anderson Fabrics don\u2019t necessarily have to possess a certain skill to obtain a job there. Cochems said that if people are willing to work and learn, they can always be trained.\n\nOnly one-third of the positions in the workroom are sewing jobs. \u201cA lot of people think they have to sew to work at Anderson Fabrics,\u201d Cochems said.\n\nThe starting wage was recently increased at Anderson Fabrics, too. After an introductory period, employees will make $9.50 an hour during the day shift and during the second shift from 3:15 to 11:45 p.m. workers make $10.50 and hour.\n\nSince Jan. 1, employees are also offered health care benefits for the first time. That\u2019s a component that was looked at in 2006, but was put on the back burner due to the recession.\n\nThe company began to again look at health care in the beginning of 2013. \u201cNo matter what happens here we plan to keep it because it\u2019s a benefit that\u2019s important,\u201d Osborn said.\n\nAnderson Fabrics attributes its recent success to a swing in the housing market and also DOTS (Daily Optimal Throughput System).\n\nDOTS is a program that uses colored stickers on order forms or receipts to let employees know the urgency of the product.\n\nBefore DOTS was put in place in 2005, it took about eight to 12 weeks to get a products back to the customer. That\u2019s been cut to two to three weeks and, according to Cochems, sometimes less.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s amazing what a difference a visual will make,\u201d Osborn said.", "article_metadata": {"news_keywords": "News,business,Anderson Fabrics,Blackduck", "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "author": "Jillian Gandsey", "og": {"site_name": "Bemidji Pioneer", "description": "BLACKDUCK \u2014 After a major low point in 2009, Anderson Fabrics has stitched its way back as a leading employer in Blackduck and northern Minnesota.\r\nThe last time the 135,000-square-foot Anderson Fabric Workroom saw 325 employees was in 2006, during the housing boom.
