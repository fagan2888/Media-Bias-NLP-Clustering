But he\u2019s no hayseed, and is already being talked up as a future Republican leader.\n\nJudy Booth of Fremont was brimming with excitement as she waited for Sasse to take the stage at his election night watch party.\n\n\u201cI have a feeling Ben will be a candidate for president some day,\u201d Booth said. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly smart; he\u2019s a solution-based thinker.\u201d\n\nSasse returned to Fremont in 2009 and helped bring its Lutheran college back from the brink of bankruptcy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen what he\u2019s done with Midland (University),\u201d Booth said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a take-charge, proactive guy.\u201d\n\nA few steps away, a veteran political reporter watching Sasse\u2019s election night party said he expects to see Sasse quickly become a leading GOP voice and run for president one day.\n\nBefore he even won the race, Sasse was christened a rising conservative star by the National Review and FOX News and praised by conservative talk show hosts Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.\n\nLimbaugh praised Sasse\u2019s ability to indict liberalism, and Hannity said of all the Senate candidates he\u2019d interviewed, Sasse was \u201cby far\u2026 the most impressive.\u201d\n\nHe was stunned by Sasse\u2019s lack of political experience, saying, \u201cmaybe that\u2019s your greatest asset.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am pleasantly shocked, and I don\u2019t mean that to be insulting to the other people running \u2014 there\u2019s some good people running,\u201d Hannity said. \u201cI think you will not only win your race but you will instantly become a leader of ideas and solutions in the Senate.\u201d\n\nHannity\u2019s producer, Lynda McLaughlin, went even further, calling Sasse a \u201crock star\u201d and saying she wants him to run for president.\n\nWhen Mitt Romney was in Nebraska stumping for Sasse, he was asked if he would run for president again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more likely I\u2019ll work for Ben some day,\u201d he joked. \u201cI\u2019ll be his cabinet secretary.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Times called Sasse \u201ca former Bush administration health official who, analysts say, has both D.C. experience and outsider appeal to be a national voice.\u201d\n\nSasse\u2019s rise from obscurity to win a U.S. Senate seat has been meteoric: When he jumped in the race a year ago, he started with 3 percent name recognition. During his first fly-around the state, just a handful of people showed up at the Lincoln airport.\n\nIn the primary, he took on a wealthy banker who dropped $2.2 million on his campaign and a military hero with high name recognition, former State Treasurer Shane Osborn. Sasse stunned, walking away with more than twice as many votes as the runner-up.\n\nPeople began to notice the young upstart with an Ivy League pedigree that trumps President Obama\u2019s: He has five degrees, including a bachelor\u2019s from Harvard and two master\u2019s degrees and a Ph.D. from Yale. His first job out of college was working for the Boston Consulting Group, a global management consulting firm. He also taught politics at the University of Texas.\n\nWhile he never held public office, he\u2019s no outsider: He was a congressional page in high school and worked as a tutor to the page program while in grad school. He was assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services under George W. Bush, chief of staff for the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Policy and briefly chief of staff for Congressman Jeff Fortenberry.\n\nWhen he decided to run for the Senate, he took his young family of five on the road, campaigning in all 93 counties in an RV adorned with red Sasse signs. His campaign would call everyone they knew in a town and maybe get a dozen people to show up at his town hall meeting.\n\nBut by their third time through town, those crowds grew to about 45. By his last fly-around of the campaign, he was surrounded by supporters. And by Election Day, his war chest had swelled to more than $6 million, his campaign staff had grown to 17 and he delivered his acceptance speech with the help of Teleprompters.\n\nAnd he walked away with more than twice as many votes as his Democratic opponent, prominent trial lawyer Dave Domina.\n\nYes, he had a big war chest and lots of help from outside groups, but he thinks the key to his win was talking about Nebraskans\u2019 \u201chopes and dreams\u201d at town hall meetings all over the state. He was coined \u201cObamacare\u2019s Cornhusker Nemesis\u201d by the National Review as he lugged a 9-foot-tall pile of Obamacare implementing rules and regs to those town halls, calling for the health care law\u2019s repeal and replacement with \u201creal health care reform.\u201d He proposed a lengthy alternative.\n\nIn the primary, his support from tea party groups got him tagged a tea partyer and \u201cthe next Ted Cruz,\u201d but he didn\u2019t seem comfortable with the label, saying he models himself more after Jack Kemp.\n\nStill, he isn\u2019t shy about taking Republicans to task, immediately putting himself on the hot seat by calling on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to show \u201cactual leadership\u201d on an Obamacare issue.\n\nHe often says, \u201cWe don\u2019t think the problem is just that the Democrats are in charge, we think that it\u2019s that too many Republicans want Washington, D.C., to be in charge.\u201d\n\nHis platform is underscored by a belief that the federal government is not the solution to all problems.\n\n\u201cI want to fight for what I call a humble politics \u2014 a Washington that does fewer things, but does the more important things, more aggressively, more transparently, more urgently, with less screaming,\u201d he says.\n\nHe eschews labels \u2014 call him a conservative and he asks, \u201cWhat does conservative mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not partisan, it\u2019s believing in people,\u201d he said, recounting a conversation with a Norfolk mechanic who said he didn\u2019t know if it\u2019s Republican, but \u201ceverybody here is conservative\u2026 and gets their crops in the ground on time.\u201d\n\nBut he is conservative and an evangelical Christian \u201cwith lots of appreciation for the Lutheran and Reformist traditions.\u201d Staunchly pro-life, he prayed outside of abortion clinics as a child, was endorsed by the National Rifle Association, supports the construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and is eager to embark on entitlement reform.\n\nAnd yet he took the unorthodox step of running radio ads in Spanish and delivering a few sentences of his acceptance speech in Spanish, saying, \u201cFriends, I believe in the American dream. Together we can create an environment in which all have more opportunities.\u201d\n\nThis in a state where Gov. Dave Heineman got elected in 2006 by upsetting beloved Husker Coach Tom Osborne in the primary, largely by pushing a hot button immigration issue \u2014 opposing in-state tuition rates for the children of illegal immigrants.\n\nThat\u2019s why Sasse reached out to Hispanics, he said Wednesday.\n\n\u201cNational reporters act like you either have to be for whatever liberal policy agenda there is in immigration reform or you can\u2019t engage Hispanic people, and I think it\u2019s a completely false choice,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on the porch in Schuyler or Lexington or south Omaha, that\u2019s not the first topic people talk about\u2026 they talk about jobs, they talk about schools, they talk about family breakdown.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019ll continue to engage Hispanic communities, but not start the conversation with things that divide Americans, but things that unite us.\n\nStill, he would oppose any attempt by President Obama to enact immigration reform through more executive orders.\n\n\u201cI sure hope he doesn\u2019t do that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious last night\u2019s election nationwide is a repudiation of his unilateral actions and so to double down and do more of it rather than coming to talk to Congress I think would be tragic.\u201d\n\nObama vowed to do just that Wednesday, saying illegal immigrants should be able to pay back taxes, pay a fine, learn English, go to the back of the line and get a pathway to citizenship.\n\nSasse believes the Republican Congress can get things done under Obama, recounting how President Ronald Reagan enacted tax reform with a Democratic Congress. He said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid took away the rights of the minority and refused to consider 350 pieces of legislation passed by the House. He thinks Republicans in the Senate will restore rights to Democrats.\n\n\u201cHarry Reid got fired last night,\u201d Sasse said. \u201cHe is the single most divisive guy in Washington.\u201d\n\nAs for all this talk about whether he is presidential timber, he cautions, \u201cI\u2019ve never run for anything before in my life. I just won our first election\u2026 we just have a heck of a lot to learn.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think about any of that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI think about the job before us. \u2026 we\u2019re doing one thing right now \u2014 we\u2019re getting ready to serve Nebraskans in January.\u201d\n\nFollow Deena on Twitter at @DeenaNEWatchdog\n\nEditor\u2019s note: to subscribe to News Updates from Nebraska Watchdog at no cost, click here.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "Watchdog.org", "description": "U.S. Senator-elect Ben Sasse is already being talked up as a future Republican leader and possible presidential contender.", "title": "Conservatives have their eye on Ben Sasse - Watchdog.org", "locale": "en_US", "image": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/BenSasse-AP.jpg", "updated_time": "2014-11-06T16:11:55+00:00", "url": "http://watchdog.org/181786/ben-sasse-4/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Watchdogorg", "section": "Nebraska", "tag": "Ben Sasse,Mitt Romney,Nebraska Senate,Rush Limbaugh,Sean Hannity,U.S. Senate Johanns", "published_time": "2014-11-06T08:52:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-11-06T16:11:55+00:00"}, "twitter": {"domain": "Watchdog.org", "description": "U.S. Senator-elect Ben Sasse is already being talked up as a future Republican leader and possible presidential contender.", "creator": "@watchdogorg", "image": {"src": "http://watchdog.org/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/11/BenSasse-AP.jpg"}, "title": "Conservatives have their eye on Ben Sasse - Watchdog.org", "site": "@watchdogorg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noarchive", "description": "U.S. Senator-elect Ben Sasse is already being talked up as a future Republican leader and possible presidential contender."}, "_id": "\"57477af46914bd0286fde115\"", "article_summary": "When Mitt Romney was in Nebraska stumping for Sasse, he was asked if he would run for president again.\nBefore he even won the race, Sasse was christened a rising conservative star by the National Review and FOX News and praised by conservative talk show hosts Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity.\nJudy Booth of Fremont was brimming with excitement as she waited for Sasse to take the stage at his election night watch party.\n\u201cI have a feeling Ben will be a candidate for president some day,\u201d Booth said.\nSasse believes the Republican Congress can get things done under Obama, recounting how President Ronald Reagan enacted tax reform with a Democratic Congress."}
