New Jersey's Senate seat stayed Democratic; Democrats swept the statewide races in Virginia, but underperformed in House of Delegates races. Two Republican House seats stayed Republican. A Virginia state Senate seat stayed, narrowly, with the Democrats, though a Republican who lost by nine votes will probably ask for a recount.\n\nDavid Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post.\n\nRepublicans have interpreted this as evidence that the Affordable Care Act is, indeed, hurting Democrats. McAuliffe's win was narrow; the state Senate seat had been won handily (57\u201343) by Obama. But the next federal election is a March special to replace the late Florida Rep. Bill Young, in one of the very few districts that voted for Obama but elected a Republican congressman. Are Republicans confident of winning?\n\nNo. They are telling everyone that Democrat Alex Sink is the favorite by leagues. National Journal's Scott Bland:\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans say that the 2010 gubernatorial candidate represents something close to an ideal special election candidate. She came with a strong political profile: Two runs for statewide office, including one victory, let her start the congressional race with big name recognition, a tested team of political advisors, and fundraising connections galore. That includes a near-immediate endorsement by EMILY's List, the powerhouse fundraising group for women Democrats, and the big-spending National Association of Realtors' political action committee.\n\nPolitico's Alex Isenstadt:\n\n\u201cYou have a superior candidate with Alex Sink, and she is raising a lot of money, she is getting a lot of support. And you have two subpar candidates in Peters and Jolly,\u201d said Mike Fasano, a popular former Republican state senator from nearby Pasco County. \u201cThe candidates that should have run did not run, so we\u2019re stuck with Peters and Jolly.\u201d\n\nTom Slade, a lobbyist and former Florida Republican Party chairman, said: \u201cAlex Sink is going to be hard to beat. She is so well-known. \u2026 It\u2019s not going to be an easy race for Republicans to win. I hope I\u2019m wrong.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"fb-share": "If Obamacare's Toxic, Why Is a Democrat Expected to Take Over a GOP Seat in Florida?", "sailthru.author": "David Weigel", "description": "The Affordable Care Act's rollout really got underway on Oct. 1, and since then voters have gone to the polls in a nice little sample of elections.
