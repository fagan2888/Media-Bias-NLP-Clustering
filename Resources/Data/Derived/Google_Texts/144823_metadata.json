Employment in Texas is up by 2.7 percent compared to one year ago.\n\nPhoto by Filipa Rodrigues/StateImpact Texas\n\nWhat\u2019s more, oil and gas exploration and production is surging, gobbling up so much electricity that there are price spikes in West Texas. In homes, there are more big screen TVs, computers, and maybe even a car plugged-in to charge overnight.\n\nAnd yet, the state\u2019s power useage has increased only half what was predicted.\n\nIt\u2019s quite the conundrum for ERCOT\u2019s analysts.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of different things going on,\u201d said Lasher. He said demand may have been decreased by fewer 100 degree days, higher peak prices for electricity, and customers utilizing \u201cdemand response\u201d measures like curtailing energy use during peak times.\n\nLasher said ERCOT is updating its forecasting models.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll see those improvements when the next load forecast is released,\u201d said Lasher.\n\nWhy Forecasting Matters\n\nForecasting future demand for electricity is one factor in play as Texas considers whether its energy market that was \u201cderegulated\u201d in 2002 is failing to attract enough investment in new power plants.\n\nCourtesy RAP\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way too soon to say the Texas market has been a failure. It\u2019s probably too soon to say it\u2019s been a success. But certainly a lot of eyes of the world are on Texas right now to see what Texas is going to do in this situation because it\u2019s a big question that a lot of people are struggling with,\u201d said Mike Hogan, a former power company executive now with RAP (Regulatory Assistance Project), a non-profit group that does global energy consulting.\n\nHogan said that Texas might not actually need to move to what\u2019s called a \u201ccapacity market\u201d in which fees are artificially imposed on the price of power to fund additonal generation.\n\n\u201c(A capacity market) is kind of like Obamacare for electricity. It\u2019s forcing people to buy insurance they wouldn\u2019t otherwise buy for themselves,\u201d said Hogan in an interview with StateImpact.\n\nHe says another utility market, ISO New England, has used the capaity market concept.\n\n\u201cGuess what, they didn\u2019t need new capacity. They thought they did. That\u2019s the problem with regulators and generators. Generators always think you need more generation than you do,\u201d said Hogan. \u201cWe might just find out Texas actually doesn\u2019t need any new capacity, at least not right now.\u201d\n\nHogan advocates what\u2019s called a \u201ccapability market\u201d that he describes as a capacity market that values more than just raw power generation.\n\nThe PUC has scheduled a workshop meeting October 8th to hear more from experts about ways to maintain enough generation capacity to cover the state\u2019s expected electricity needs but at \u201ceconomically optimal\u201d cost.", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "StateImpact Texas", "description": "As the Texas Public Utility Commission (PUC) considers changing the electricity market so there's more money to build new power plants, a mystery has popped up: why aren't Texans using as much electricity as predicted?\r\n\r\n\"There\u2019s something that\u2019s been going on recently with the forecasts, which affects a lot of things,\" said PUC commissioner Kenneth Anderson", "title": "Texans Use Less Power than Expected, Baffling State Regulators", "url": "https://stateimpact.npr.org/texas/2013/09/05/texans-use-less-power-than-expected-baffling-state-regulators/", "image": "https://stateimpact.npr.org/texas/files/2013/09/Mining-075-2-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 10217706}, "generator": "WordPress 3.5.1", "description": "As the Texas Public Utility Commission (PUC) considers changing the electricity market so there's more money to build new power plants, a mystery has popped up: why aren't Texans using as much electricity as predicted?\r\n\r\n\"There\u2019s something that\u2019s been going on recently with the forecasts, which affects a lot of things,\" said PUC commissioner Kenneth Anderson", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "article_summary": "Texans Use Less Power than Expected, Baffling State Regulators AUDIO By Dave Fehling EmailTweetDave Fehling / StateImpactAs the Texas Public Utility Commission (PUC) considers changing the electricity market so there\u2019s more money to build new power plants, a mystery has popped up: why aren\u2019t Texans using as much electricity as predicted?\nAnderson said forecasts from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) had predicted electricity demand would increase in 2013 by 2.1 percent.\nCourtesy RAP\u201cIt\u2019s way too soon to say the Texas market has been a failure.\n\u201c(A capacity market) is kind of like Obamacare for electricity.\nLasher said usually the non-farm employment numbers are a reliable indicator of how much more power will be used in homes, offices and factories."}
