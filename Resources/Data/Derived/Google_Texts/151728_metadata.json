Depending on who you talk to, he\u2019s either a power-mad incompetent who\u2019s leading the group towards disaster or the victim of a political witch-hunt based on his relationship as the significant other of \u2018new Republican\u2019 congressional candidate Carl DeMaio.\n\nOn one level the question is whether the event-centric HBIA, the driving force behind the Hillcrest Farmers Market, Hillcrest Hoedown, CityFest, the Pride Block Party, and Mardi Gras, is really acting in the best interests of the estimated 1,300 businesses in the area. Critics of the city-sanctioned group are calling for the resignation of Hale and asking for an audit of HBIA finances\n\nOn a deeper level the controversy reflects divisions within the LGBTQ movement, which has historically been centered in Hillcrest.\n\nThings came to head at the most recent meeting of the HBIA board. An account of the meeting written by Timothy Holmberg in RealPolitikSD:\n\nThe longtime partner of Congressional hopeful Carl DeMaio has been targeted by community activists John Thurston and David Lundin, who raised charges against Hale of willful ignorance of open meeting laws and fiduciary responsibilities\u2026\n\nThe HBIA is most noted for its signature annual event \u201cCityFest\u201d which draws tens of thousands of visitors into the heart of Hillcrest. The event was established to raise funds for the maintenance of the historic \u201cHillcrest\u201d sign that straddles University Avenue. The event has raised subsantial cash for the HBIA, but in recent years, proceeds from the event have all but dried up. This trend, however, has occurred while attendance and participation at the event has been breaking records, causing many to question where the money is going. In fact almost all the several events that the HBIA puts on are either in the red or generating scant returns.\n\nLong-time activist Nicole Murray Ramirez, writing in an op-ed column for the LGBT Weekly, said the upheaval was based on \u201cpeople [who] do not like change or strong leadership.\u201d\n\nAlmost all of the past board members who spoke were old and from a different generation and obviously do not like change.\n\nBut, what was more obvious to me was that they had one single agenda \u2013 to remove the HBA president, businessman Johnathan Hale who, by the way, was elected unanimously by its members.\n\nAll the speakers totally focused on Hale and almost all of them are known to have political differences with Hale and his life partner, former City Councilman Carl DeMaio.\n\nThis was like a lynching mob without the rope and most of us in attendance saw right through this \u2026 let\u2019s call it exactly like it was \u2026 this was a planned, organized coup against the current HBA president \u2026 period.\n\nI don\u2019t know if Murray-Ramirez is the right person one to be characterizing anybody as old or resistant to change, given her support for Kevin Faulconer, whose administration is clearly the antithesis of change.\n\nBusinessman John Thurston, who led the effort to call for a change at the top of the HBIA, responded:\n\nCalling independent and concerned voices in opposition to Hale\u2019s tenure as some sort of organized lynch mob could be nothing further from the truth, and show that there is a broad based independent dissatisfaction from residents, small business owners, vendors that have serviced the HBA such as my self, and from staffers and others who have suffered from Hale\u2019s erratic and belligerent treatment to any who stand in his way.\n\nNicole Murray I would like to remind you of your very own harsh criticism in this very column of Hale and his \u201cSoft Porn\u201d publication SDPIX, for publishing a series of images that not only blatantly promoted the Drug and Sex destructive sub culture in the LGBT community, but were a direct affront to you and the entire Recovery community in San Diego.\n\nHow many more of these missteps should not only the HBA Board tolerate, but local businesses and residents who seek a vibrant and healthy community organization that has Hillcrest\u2019s small businesses\u2019 best interests in mind, and not the selfish and ego driven interests of blatant marketing huckster in Hillcrest.\n\nWhats next, promises of a fabulous marching band and flashy uniforms with 76 Trombones\u2026more likely Rusty Trombones knowing Hale\u2019s predilection for appealing to the lowest common denominator in the LGBT community.\n\nFueling the anger at the business group was former director Benjamin Nichols being hired to replace his successor. Here\u2019s some of the background on Nichols via SocialTrusted.org:\n\nNicholls soon began turning the HBA into a permanent, private fundraising machine. He first generated controversy by trying to take a larger share from the weekly Hillcrest Farmers Market. During the next three years, he added open-ended fund-raising events such as Taste n\u2019 Tinis and the Hillcrest Hoe Down, each with hefty admission fees and a profit-sharing agreement with the promotion company.\n\nThe Amazing High Heel Race was first held to raise funds for the Hillcrest Pride Flag Project, but then was continued to fund a park and then a monument designed by a current HBA board member\u2014and next to install a $20,000 rainbow cross walk.\n\nEarlier this year, a dispute between the HBA and the Greater San Diego Business Association over control of the Mardi Gras fundraiser led to the HBA to pull out completely rather than compromise and decide to pursue a competing \u201cFat Tuesday\u201d event in 2014. And as of this year, San Diego Pride was allowed to take on the Pride of Hillcrest Block Party\u2014but only by splitting all profits equally with the HBA, using the HBA\u2019s promotion company, and forbidding San Diego Pride from hosting any other parties.\n\nAll of these events are promoted for the public to attend to have fun while helping raise money for the \u201ccommunity.\u201d But since there is zero oversight, this money can and has been used for pet projects with no input and against objections.\n\nIn the meantime, empty pep talks took the place of actual business development efforts, and businesses continued to fail at a faster rate than elsewhere.\n\nAs of August 6, 2013, it was announced that Nicholls is leaving the HBA to take a senior position at McFarlane Communications. If that name sounds familiar, it\u2019s because for at least the past two years McFarlane has been the promotion company and public relations firm for the HBA. Last year this contract was worth $47,500-$49,000 in fees alone (variance based on profit sharing), but the actual value of the contract was double that, as the contract directed how much McFarlane was to spend on each event and then send the invoices to the HBA for payment. This would be a violation of the City contract that any project greater than $50K needs more than three bids in writing, but it definitely required that at least three be provided in writing.\n\nJohn R. Lamb, writing in City Beat\u2019s Spin Cycle column, interviewed Sonya Stauffer, who described the HBIA under Hale as \u201cBusiness last, politics first:\u201d\n\nOn June 5, Stauffer said Hale arrived at the HBA\u2019s Fifth Avenue office after a phone call during which he said he\u2019d be there in 15 minutes to terminate her. \u201cHe came into the office, took my keys and unplugged my computer\u2014 pulled the power cord out of the back!\u2014for the \u2018safety of the organization\u2019 and told me to get my things and get out,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said he then followed her out to the parking lot and, during the course of what she described as a bizarre hour-and-a-half, tried to return her office key. \u201cHe was in my car door, and I\u2019m telling him I want to go home, and he\u2019s trying to give me my key back. He knew what he had done was wrong. He was panicked.\n\n\u201cHe tends to make knee-jerk decisions in a state of being angry and then is sorry later,\u201d Stauffer said.\n\nActivist Linda Perine forcefully responded to Murray-Ramirez via Facebook:\n\nJust out of curiosity:\n\nHow many of you have been threatened with economic or other harm by the President of the HBA for failing to do as he \u201ccommanded\u201d you in political or economic circumstances?\n\nHow many of you have been threatened by the author of this commentary for failing to \u201ckiss the ring\u201d (or more nether regions)?\n\nHow many of you have been publicly excoriated, lied about and libeled by the author of this commentary in LGBT Weekly?\n\nI can certainly raise my hand multiple times to all 3 questions. I\u2019m guessing there are a substantial number of folks who can do the same.\n\nOur community deserves so much better.\n\nThe questions raised by a now former employee; the very legitimate concerns about ADA issues; the incredibly poor judgment shown in handling the employment issue (smart management would know you do NOT have these conversations by publication); ongoing concerns about allocation of resources and bookkeeping. Really legitimate questions, being raised by credible people, that, if Facebook posts are any indication, are being met by denial and foolish personal attacks. Hint: if the former ED has ANY legitimate employment law claim, the current ED\u2019s ill advised letter to SDGLN just boosted her settlement substantially. The HBA Board needs to address these issues in a professional manner.\n\nThe LGBT community has a responsible and respected position in this city. We need to stop acting like the 3 stooges on steroids.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly true that Carl DeMaio, whether in person or as a doppelganger, evokes a strong reaction in the LGBT community. Activists using a Facebook page event are calling on spectators to turn their backs as DeMaio walks by in this year\u2019s July 19th Gay Pride parade: \u201cIf you are unwilling to support your own rights along with our communities rights we will not support you.\u201d\n\nRacism in the USA Writ Large\n\nThink Progress has posted a story about a hate group campaign to send dirty underwear to undocumented immigrants and top politicians in order to stop the \u201cnew surge of illegal immigrants crossing America\u2019s borders, enticed by promises of immigration reform amnesty.\u201d\n\nIn a message board thread posted on Wednesday, William Gheen, president of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC (ALIPAC), wrote that Americans should mail more than 10,000 pairs of used underwear that range anywhere from \u201cgently used\u201d to those in \u201cbad shape\u201d to President Obama, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH), and undocumented immigrants in detention facilities.\n\n\u201cObama and Boehner have proven once and for all that their talk of passing immigration reform amnesty, instead of enforcing America\u2019s existing border and immigration laws, only brings more unwanted and destructive illegal immigration!\u201d said Gheen in his post.\n\n\u201cInstead of using our tax money to buy illegals 42,000 pairs of new underwear, we would like to send the illegals and DC politicians a message by mailing them our used underwear, and some of our pairs are in really bad shape due to the bad economy and all of the jobs illegal immigrants are taking from Americans.\u201d\n\nHere in San Diego a home-grown extremist has proposed a different \u201cget out the hate\u201d effort, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center HateWatch blog:\n\nPete Santilli, an extremist antigovernment talk show host and 9/11 truther, is working with a group of bikers to shut down the U.S.-Mexico border crossing near San Diego on \u201cCinco de Julio.\u201d\n\nSantilli, who lives in San Diego and hosts a program on the Guerilla Media Network, is best known for a violent rant last year in which he called for President Obama and the Bush family to be killed and for Hillary Clinton to be shot in the vagina and \u201csuffer painfully, right in front of me.\u201d His remarks drew scrutiny from the Secret Service.\n\nA Batting Average Worse Than the San Diego Padres\n\nNew York Times colunmist Paul Krugman has an especially good essay today, taking the Obamacare doom and gloom team to task:\n\nHave you been following the news about Obamacare? The Affordable Care Act has receded from the front page, but information about how it\u2019s going keeps coming in \u2014 and almost all the news is good. Indeed, health reform has been on a roll ever since March, when it became clear that enrollment would surpass expectations despite the teething problems of the federal website.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about this success story is that it has been accompanied at every step by cries of impending disaster. At this point, by my reckoning,the enemies of health reform are 0 for 6. That is, they made at least six distinct predictions about how Obamacare would fail \u2014 every one of which turned out to be wrong.\n\nOn This Day: 1905 \u2013 The Industrial Workers of the World, also known as the \u201cWobblies,\u201d was founded at a 12-day-long convention in Chicago. The Wobbly motto: \u201cAn injury to one is an injury to all.\u201d 1964 \u2013 Jan & Dean\u2019s \u201cLittle Old Lady From Pasadena\u201d was released1969 \u2013 Patrons at the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City\u2019s Greenwich Village, clashed with police. This incident is considered to be the birth of the gay rights movement.\n\nDid you enjoy this article?
