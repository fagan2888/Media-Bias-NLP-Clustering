Think nothing can be done about spiraling college costs? Then take a look at Purdue University — and how President Mitch Daniels is proving otherwise.

At Purdue, the former governor of ­Indiana has begun employing the same creative cost-saving, private-sector-style innovation that he introduced to his state nearly a decade ago. And it’s paying off.

For starters, he’s frozen tuition for three years, through 2015-16 school year — after 36 straight years of hikes.

He’s cutting student dining costs by 10 percent, and he’s found other savings by selling school cars and renovating furniture.

This month, Daniels announced a deal with Amazon that could save students as much as 30 percent on books. Amazon will also build nearby pick-up and drop-off sites for students to purchase or trade in books.

There’s more: The ex-governor has introduced an experimental program that allows students to earn their bachelor’s degree in three years, instead of four. That’s a potential savings of $10,000.

Daniels’ measures might not work for every college. But they offer reason to doubt claims by school administrators that costs must only go one way: up.

Fact is, there’s plenty of fat in higher education, particularly when it comes to bloated administrative costs.

As any college student (and his or her parents) knows, that has driven tuition costs sky-high. Government subsidies have only rocketed them higher.

Students, parents and taxpayers need relief. Schools might provide it if they take Daniels’ course in Cost-Cutting 101.
