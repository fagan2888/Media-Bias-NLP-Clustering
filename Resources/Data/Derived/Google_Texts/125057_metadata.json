Victims included a number of confirmed summary executions committed by ISIL as well as prisoners killed by retreating Iraqi forces.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said ISIL posted about 60 photographs on its Twitter feed on June 14, showing fighters loading captives in civilian clothes onto trucks and then forcing them to lie in three shallow trenches.\n\nHRW counted the bodies visible in the available photographs, and estimated that ISIL killed between 90 and 110 men in one trench and between 35 and 40 men in the second.\n\nA further photograph shows a large trench with between 35 and 40 prisoners shot but Human Rights Watch said it had not been able to pinpoint the site.\n\nA U.N. human rights spokesman said on Tuesday that ISIL had broadcast dozens of videos showing cruel treatment, beheadings and shootings of captured soldiers, police officers and people apparently targeted because of their religion or ethnicity, including Shi\u2019ites and minorities such as Christians.\n\nNorthern units of Iraq\u2019s million-strong army, trained and equipped by the United States, largely evaporated after Sunni Islamist fighters led by the ISIL launched their assault.\n\nIn Tikrit on Friday, Iraqi army helicopters fired on a university campus in an effort to dislodge ISIL fighters, a day after launching an airborne assault on the city.\n\n(Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "article_metadata": {"description": "LONDON (Reuters) - Photograph and satellite imagery indicate that Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) insurgents have carried out mass executions in the northern Iraqi city of Tikrit, Human Rights Watch reported on Friday.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Free Beacon", "description": "By Costas Pitas    LONDON (Reuters) - Photograph and satellite imagery indicate that Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) insurgents have carried out mass executions in the northern Iraqi city", "title": "ISIL Staged \u2018Mass Executions\u2019 in Iraq\u2019s Tikrit", "url": "http://freebeacon.com/national-security/isil-staged-mass-executions-in-iraqs-tikrit/", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ISIL-Iraq1-150x150.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@freebeacon", "image": "http://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/ISIL-Iraq1-150x150.jpg", "description": "By Costas Pitas    LONDON (Reuters) - Photograph and satellite imagery indicate that Islamic State i", "card": "summary", "title": "ISIL Staged \u2018Mass Executions\u2019 in Iraq\u2019s Tikrit"}, "robots": "noodp", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1047859882", "fb": {"app_id": "FB_APP_ID"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd41cc\"", "article_summary": "BY:By Costas PitasLONDON (Reuters) \u2013 Photograph and satellite imagery indicate that Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) insurgents have carried out mass executions in the northern Iraqi city of Tikrit, Human Rights Watch reported on Friday.\nA further photograph shows a large trench with between 35 and 40 prisoners shot but Human Rights Watch said it had not been able to pinpoint the site.\nVictims included a number of confirmed summary executions committed by ISIL as well as prisoners killed by retreating Iraqi forces.\nIn Tikrit on Friday, Iraqi army helicopters fired on a university campus in an effort to dislodge ISIL fighters, a day after launching an airborne assault on the city.\n\u201cThe photos and satellite images from Tikrit provide strong evidence of a horrible war crime that needs further investigation,\u201d Human Rights Watch emergencies director Peter Bouckaert said in a statement."}
