(AP) \u2014 It\u2019s called \u201cpassing the trash\u201d: A school suspects a teacher of sexual misconduct and forces the teacher out to protect the students. But that teacher can still get a new job in a new school, sometimes with a glowing recommendation.\n\nOnly Pennsylvania, Missouri and Oregon ban the maneuver, but a federal mandate passed in December now requires states to address its potential risks. Connecticut is considering such legislation.\n\nOne woman abused by such a teacher says it\u2019s about time the problem is getting attention.\n\nShe was 16 when her English teacher at the exclusive Marlborough School in Los Angeles began grooming her. He showered her with praise, gave her gifts and pitted her against her friends. Then there was a sexual advance, and sex. Eventually, she became pregnant and miscarried.\n\nShe reported him only years later, after she learned he had targeted another girl more recently. A lawsuit she filed says he was accused of misconduct at two schools before Marlborough hired him. When he was finally pushed out of Marlborough, the school gave him a recommendation, the suit asserts.\n\nThe woman, now 31, says it is infuriating that the man who abused her, Joseph Koetters, was able to \u201chit the reset button\u201d and start fresh at a new school. Koetters pleaded guilty to sexually molesting her and another girl and was sentenced in October to a year behind bars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that not just in Marlborough but in all these cases nationwide, the schools lack the will or the moral compass to take these measures on their own,\u201d the woman said.\n\nA judge last month denied the school\u2019s motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The school did not comment, citing the pending litigation.\n\nThe Associated Press does not identify victims of sexual abuse without their consent.\n\nThe woman\u2019s lawyer, David Ring, says it\u2019s a problem at public schools and private schools alike. He won a $5.6 million jury verdict in 2013 in the case of a public school teacher in California who sexually abused a 14-year-old girl. Even though the school knew the teacher had sent her romantic emails midyear, he was allowed to finish the year and left the school with a letter of recommendation.\n\nMore recently in Rhode Island, multiple teachers now accused in a sex abuse scandal at the exclusive boarding school St. George\u2019s School were pushed out but went on to new jobs in schools around the country.", "article_metadata": {"description": "States seek to stymie hiring suspected sex-predator teachers", "title": "States seek to stymie hiring suspected sex-predator teachers", "og": {"site_name": "Salon", "description": "States seek to stymie hiring suspected sex-predator teachers", "title": "States seek to stymie hiring suspected sex-predator teachers", "url": "http://www.salon.com/2016/03/07/states_seek_to_stymie_hiring_suspected_sex_predator_teachers/", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/school-abuse-teachers.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"description": "States seek to stymie hiring suspected sex-predator teachers", "title": "States seek to stymie hiring suspected sex-predator teachers", "image": "http://media.salon.com/2016/03/school-abuse-teachers.jpeg-1280x960.jpg", "creator": "@salon", "site": "@salon", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "author": "Michelle R.
