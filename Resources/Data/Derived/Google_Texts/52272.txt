A who’s who in Denver and Colorado politics turned out Saturday night for former Denver Mayor Wellington Webb’s 73rd birthday party.

A stunning cake and an amazing band, along with a slide show of photos, were part of the festivities at the Exdo Event Center.

Wilma Webb, a former state legislator, surveyed the room, the guests and the photos that flashed around the room featuring her husband with now Secretary of State John Kerry, former Gov. Dick Lamm, then President Clinton and Pope John Paul II on his visit to Denver in 1993. Some of the older, black-and-white photos featured Webb in an Afro, his wife in a mini skirt and the mayor on his college baseketball team.

“We have,” Wilma Webb said, “had very blessed lives.”

Wellington Webb was born Feb. 17, 1941, but he hasn’t slowed down that much. The party began at 8 p.m. and was billed to last until 2 a.m.

The elected officials present included U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, state Rep. Max Tyler of Lakewood, Denver City Councilman Chris Nevitt and two University of Colorado regents, Michael Carrigan and Joe Neguse, who is running for secretary of state. A number of people who helped Webb win his first mayoral race in 1991 showed up, as did plenty of folks who worked in the Webb administration, including former spokesman Andrew Hudson.

Others present included former Denver Post city-editor-turned-politico Evan Dreyer;former Rep. Rosemary Marshall; political consultant Greg Kolomitz; and Josh Miller, political director for U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette.
