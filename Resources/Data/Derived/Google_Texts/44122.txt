“Malcolm in the Middle” star is no fan of the president

Add Frankie Muniz to the chorus of critics of Obamacare.

The rollout of the Affordable Healthcare Act, intended to extend coverage to millions of Americans, has been marred by technical problems and a spotty website that makes registration difficult. On Friday, a White House official said that the glitches would be smoothed out by the end of November.

But that timetable isn’t good enough for the “Malcolm in the Middle” star.

“This Obamacare launch is an embarrassment to the American people,” Muniz tweeted. “How many more promises have to be broken?”

Muniz, who briefly tried a racing career and later became a drummer for the band Kingsfoil, has been largely absent from the big or small screens since “Malcolm in the Middle” wrapped up its seven season run in 2006. He did have a starring role in 2011’s “Pizza Man” and logged guest appearances on “Last Man Standing and “Don’t Trust the B—- in Apartment 23.”

For the most part, his Twitter feed has been devoted to tales from the road with his band and details of his fast food excursions, but he has made a few brief forays into politics. In June, for instance, he criticized a key foreign policy adviser appointment.

“Really? Susan Rice? National Security Adviser? Really? Another # ObamaFail. Wake up people,” Muniz tweeted.

Rice has been loudly criticized in conservative circles for her handling of questions related to the 2012 Benghazi attack that left four people dead, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.

No word yet on how Muniz views the president’s handling of the crisis in Syria or the debt ceiling debate, but we’ll remain glued to Twitter.
