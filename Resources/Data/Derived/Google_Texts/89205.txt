The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is still trying to improve the new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) tax forms.

The agency posted several new PPACA tax form draft revisions Wednesday, including a new version of Form 1095-C, Employer Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage; Form 1094-C, Transmittal of Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage Information Return; and Form 1095-A, Health Insurance Marketplace Statement.
