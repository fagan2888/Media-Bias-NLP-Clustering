The City of Wichita is preparing for a winter blast as travelers head home over the weekend.

Wichita Public Works says they are uncertain about what to expect when it comes to this weekends' roads conditions, but Director Alan King says crews are ready.

"Perhaps some rain turning into snow and freezing and that's expected Sunday night into Monday," said Public Works Director Alan King.

King says if that's the case this storm could bring challenges for treatment.

"We'll do a little bit of that on the elevated structures early on with the overpasses and bridges, but the rain has a tendency to wash the sand and salt off so it doesn't do any good," he said.

Street crew staff will be on-call all weekend and the City's fleet of 60 plow trucks will be deployed hours before the storm arrives. King says drivers should also be ready.

"You may be out on the roads and not realize you're out on ice so please drive carefully."

As a reminder Wichita snow plows only hit the main street routes, meaning many neighborhoods will not be touched.

Wichita street crews will be on call this weekend for the possibility of winter weather.

Crews have been working on bridges and overpasses. All sixty plows will be deployed before the storm arrives. "We'll continue to monitor the forecast you know with this far out and this much variation with models we're prepared in even extreme events but I think the wind is going to be one of those things that's going to be more severe. As far as upper 50 mile an hour gusts is what they're talking about, " said Public Works Director Alan King.

With thousands expected on the road, King suggests everyone take it slow on the roads, particularly on elevated roadways.
