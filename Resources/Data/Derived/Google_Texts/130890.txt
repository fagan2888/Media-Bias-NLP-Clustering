Saturday Night Live’s President Obama took on the Schoolhouse Rock bill on Saturday night and the results are hilarious. Keenan Thompson plays the traditional role of a bill. The type of bill that may have passed through the House and Senate and became a law 50 years ago.

Thompson sings the traditional lyrics for the Schoolhouse Rock song, until Barack Obama shows up to “deal” with the bills tomfoolery. Obama looks at the bill, and before they even chat, the POTUS pushes the bill down the Capital Hill steps.

The bill is then replaced by “Executive Order” and instead of a fancy song explaining how an Executive Order works, it just aptly says “I just happen.”

The Executive Order goes on to explain that it has helped create many worthwhile projects in America, such as National Parks.

Eventually the original bill climbs back atop the Capitol Hill steps, only to be pushed back down once again by President Obama.

In probably the funniest moment in the video, even the Executive Order is surprised when President Obama says he just gave five million undocumented immigrants legal status in the United States. The bills reaction? “Whoa.”

We have to wonder what the Executive Order would think if they were told about the Affordable Health Care Act, and various other executive orders recently issued by President Obama, George W. Bush, and every other President of the United States.

The YouTube video has been live for a few hours and it has already racked up 527 upvotes.

The idea behind the Schoolhouse Rock bill process is great in theory, but this skit really hits the nail on the head when it comes to the current state of political affairs.
