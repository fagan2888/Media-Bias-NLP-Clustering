As the graph below shows, that leaves a family of three considerably below the federal poverty line. However, the EITC, which is designed to encourage work among low-wage employees, provides an additional 36 percent boost in overall income, pushing that family just above the poverty level.\n\nShould Congress raise the minimum wage as the president has suggested \u2014 an increase of nearly 40 percent \u2014 the annual take-home pay of a minimum wage worker would jump to $19,656, leaving a family of three just above the poverty line even without the EITC. Because the EITC phases out as income increases, the boost to take-home income from a minimum wage worker making $10.10 per hour is more modest, at 25 percent.\n\nSome who oppose the increase of the minimum wage on the grounds that it would reduce job creation argue that expanding the EITC is actually a better idea. Writing in The Washington Post earlier this year, economist Glenn Hubbard, former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the George W. Bush administration, said that increasing the benefits to certain low-wage workers would \"help counter poverty among the working poor.\" There is also some debate among economists over whether the EITC would be more effective if it were delivered as a regular paycheck supplement, rather than a lump sum at tax time.\n\nStill, Boushey\u2019s chart is a strong visual reminder of just what minimum wage workers earn, and how much of a federal benefit is needed to bring their income to a level that keeps them out of poverty.\n\nTop Reads from The Fiscal Times:", "article_metadata": {"og": {"site_name": "The Fiscal Times", "description": "Minimum wage workers see a pronounced bump in their overall compensation from the Earned Income Tax Credit \u2013 in some cases boosting income by as much as 36 percent.", "title": "The Truth About Minimum Wage Workers\u2019 Take-Home Pay", "url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/13/Truth-About-Minimum-Wage-Workers-Take-Home-Pay", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Minimum%20Wage%20REUTERS%3AAndrew%20Kelly.jpg", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Articles/2014/03/13/Truth-About-Minimum-Wage-Workers-Take-Home-Pay", "image": "http://cdn.thefiscaltimes.com/sites/default/files/Minimum%20Wage%20REUTERS%3AAndrew%20Kelly.jpg", "creator": "@rrgarver", "card": "summary", "title": "The Fiscal Times"}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Minimum wage workers see a pronounced bump in their overall compensation from the Earned Income Tax Credit \u2013 in some cases boosting income by as much as 36 percent.", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)"}, "article_summary": "Because the EITC phases out as income increases, the boost to take-home income from a minimum wage worker making $10.10 per hour is more modest, at 25 percent.\nShould Congress raise the minimum wage as the president has suggested \u2014 an increase of nearly 40 percent \u2014 the annual take-home pay of a minimum wage worker would jump to $19,656, leaving a family of three just above the poverty line even without the EITC.\nSome who oppose the increase of the minimum wage on the grounds that it would reduce job creation argue that expanding the EITC is actually a better idea.\nToday, a worker earning the minimum wage who works 40 hours per week, 52 weeks per year, with no days off, sick days, vacation, or other missed work, would earn $15,080.\nAs the graph below shows, that leaves a family of three considerably below the federal poverty line."}
