Both departments, like all departments across the state, have been hard hot by changes in the state\u2019s administration of public health as state dollars diminish and medical responsibilities are shifted away from county health departments. The budget Gov. Rick Scott is proposing this year would eliminate 758 health department positions in the state, though this year\u2019s budget projects no layoffs in Flagler. The county\u2019s health department has maintained staffing at around 52 for the past seven years, on a budget of $3.6 million (just $250,000 of it from county taxes), though last year it went into its reserves, drawing down $193,000, to maintain its level of service.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a sign of an organization that\u2019s having some financial difficulties,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nThe department actually peaked at 60 people at one point, but has reduced its staffing through attrition, Johnson said. More cuts are coming. \u201cObviously we\u2019ve talked about it, we\u2019ve been upfront about it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOur business has decreased, so folks know here, we\u2019ve let them know, except for the very specifics about it, and we\u2019ll have to make those difficult decisions relatively soon.\u201d He said the cuts will amount to fewer than 10 people.\n\nIn another significant change, the department will end primary care services at the end of June. \u201cThe Florida Medicaid managed care has decreased our patients in primary care from 2700 to, we have just a little over 1,000 right now, and we just cannot sustain that program,\u201d Johnson said. The state\u2019s new managed-care system requires Medicaid recipients to seek care in the private sectopr, through one of four private-sector providers. It\u2019s a reflection of the governor\u2019s antipathy for government-provided care, even though that care has generally been provided efficiently and effectively\u2014and even though the governor has no issue channeling government dollars to private providers.\n\nAzalea Health Care opens in Palm Coast on Palm Coast Parkway and Florida Park Drive at the end of August, providing some of that care locally. \u201cSo the majority of patients will be going there,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize the majority of our patients come from Palm Coast to begin with. About 75 percent of pour patients are Palm Coast residents.\u201d\n\nAzalea Health is a non-profit provider based in Putnam County that started operating in 1977. It\u2019s a federally designated qualified health center (a designation the Flagler Health Department sought and failed to secure a few years ago). Azalea operates nine primary-care health centers in Alachua, Clay, Putnam and St. Johns. The Palm Coast location will be its 10th.\n\n\u201cOverall people like to choose where they want to go, and they\u2019re going to places where they ddin\u2019t have an opportunity to go to before,\u201d Johnson said of the choice system under Medicaid.\n\nIn yet other changes that underscore the changing and diminishing role of the health department, Johnson said the Flagler department lost its tobacco-prevention grant to a competitor this year. \u201cWe were very disappointed in this,\u201d Johnson said, referring to Lake Worth-based Civic Communications. \u201cBut they underbid us, and they got one letter of support. We had letters of support from many, many folks. So that\u2019s going to be handed over to another organization beginning July 1.\u201d This even though the department successfully lobbied local governments in Palm Coast, Bunnell and Flagler Beach to pass resolutions discouraging the sale of flavored tobacco, and the department led four beach clean-ups of cigarette butts, a bane of local beaches. \u201cEvery time we do it, it\u2019s amazing to see how much cigarette butts are picked up on the beach and on the boardwalk,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nJohnson made his retirement announcement at the end of a brief presentation to the Flagler County Commission, an annual ritual when he sums up the year\u2019s achievements and challenges.\n\nAmong the department\u2019s continuing successes: the federal WIC program\u2014Women, Infants and Children\u2014which provides nutrition assistance to young mothers and their children. It\u2019s the department\u2019s busiest program, with Flagler ranking first in the state with \u201cbreast-feeding initiation.\u201d Local residents who receive WIC vouchers spent $1.3 million in local grocery stores.\n\n\u201cI would like to see WIC expanded, it\u2019s our biggest department, it brings money into the county,\u201d Johnson said, but the program\u2019s personnel is cramped. He asked the county commission for help in that regard.\n\nThe department cared for 236 pregnant women last year, and provided family planning for 1,900 people. Many health departments are dropping pre-natal care from their responsibilities, as did Volusia, St. Johns and Putnam counties. Not so in Flagler, at least not yet. \u201cWe consider pre-natal care still our core public health because it\u2019s a safety net,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue as long as we can.\u201d Why is it being dropped? \u201cIt\u2019s a money loser in many regards. We don\u2019t get a lot of money for it. You end up seeing a lot of unfunded women, meaning they don\u2019t have Medicaid and they have no insurance, and we still take care of some of those women.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just curious further why they would stop treating,\u201d Commissioner Nate McLaughlin said. \u201cAt some point it\u2019s going to be\u2014even if you look at it financially\u2014the medical liability to the county you could either catch it up front or catch it at the end. You\u2019d think it would be less expensive to catch it up front from a financial standpoint.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a way they\u2019ve just moved their patients to the private sector for them to take care of it,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAnd then they have to work with Healthy Start Coalition to try to find some providers who\u2019ll take the unfunded women. But we do that right here, and we are going to continue to do that.\u201d\n\nThe governor has refused to sign on to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion, which would have provided the state with $50 billion over 10 years and broadened health care coverage for upwards of 1 million Floridians.\n\nThe department t conducted 640 disease investigations last year and reported 276 \u201creportable diseases\u201d for the year. There were 29 food illness reports to the department with 17 investigated outbreaks that exposed almost 3,000 people. The department also had 223 animal bite reports. It had no tuberculosis patients last year. It has one this year. The department treated 921 people for sexually transmitted diseases last year. The department\u2019s dental pediatric program also has 2,500 patients.\n\nJohnson wanted to stress: the department is ready to staff a special needs shelter during weather or other emergencies.\n\nIn the near future, the department will be promoting healthy-weight initiatives so people get more involved in caring for their own health. The department is also starting HIV medical and dental care for adults, which will keep patients from going to Volusia or St. Johns County.\n\nFinally, Johnson said, \u201cI will be retiring at the end of the month after 11 years.\u201d\n\nJohnson will be joining the Haywood County Health Department in Waynesville, N.C., near where he and his wife, Kathie, decided to retire. He will be the department\u2019s nursing director, the position he held at the Volusia County Health Department before he took the top post in Flagler. He was previously the chief nurse in an Air Force Reserve unit at Patrick Air Force Base in Brevard County. His wife will retire at month\u2019s end from Halifax hospital, where she\u2019s worked 28 years.\n\n\u201cKathie and I have been going up to that part of North Carolina for many, many years, way back,\u201d Johnson, 61, said, \u201cand we started looking at where we might want to retire to in the mid 2000s. Kathie is quite a researcher type, and she found some property up there which looked very nice. We bought property up there in 2006, quite a while ago, and started talking to a potential builder probably five years before he started building the house. We decided to start building a house up there a little over a year or so.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cYeah, I\u2019m too young to retire retire. I just looked at a web site and there was a job.\u201d He wanted to work in the community where he\u2019ll be living. So he will.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to thank Patrick for his service, not only to our country but to our county,\u201d Commissioner George Hanns said.\n\n\u201cThis hasn\u2019t been easy because I\u2019ve really enjoyed this job, I\u2019ve enjoyed working with people in this building,\u201d Johnson said.", "article_metadata": {"description": "Flagler County Health Department Administrator Patrick Johnson is resigning at the end of the month to take a public health post in North Carolina as county departments in Florida see their roles shift and diminish.", "generator": "WordPress 4.5.2", "og": {"site_name": "FlaglerLive", "description": "Flagler County Health Department Administrator Patrick Johnson is resigning at the end of the month to take a public health post in North Carolina as county departments in Florida see their roles shift and diminish.", "title": "Administrator Patrick Johnson Calls It Quits as Flagler Health Department Endures Big Changes | FlaglerLive", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"width": 650, "identifier": "http://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/patrick-johnson-health.jpg", "height": 431}, "updated_time": "2015-06-01T14:55:59-04:00", "url": "http://flaglerlive.com/79341/patrick-johnson-public-health/", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "http://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/patrick-johnson-health.jpg", "description": "Flagler County Health Department Administrator Patrick Johnson is resigning at the end of the month to take a public health post in North Carolina as county departments in Florida see their roles shift and diminish.", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Administrator Patrick Johnson Calls It Quits as Flagler Health Department Endures Big Changes | FlaglerLive"}, "robots": "noodp", "framework": "Alkivia Framework 0.9", "fb": {"app_id": 116656355016711}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://flaglerlive.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-FlaglerLive-270x270.jpg", "article": {"section": "Carousel", "tag": "poverty", "published_time": "2015-06-01T11:01:32-04:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-01T14:55:59-04:00"}}, "article_summary": "It\u2019s a federally designated qualified health center (a designation the Flagler Health Department sought and failed to secure a few years ago).\nIn yet other changes that underscore the changing and diminishing role of the health department, Johnson said the Flagler department lost its tobacco-prevention grant to a competitor this year.\nBoth departments, like all departments across the state, have been hard hot by changes in the state\u2019s administration of public health as state dollars diminish and medical responsibilities are shifted away from county health departments.\nRick Scott is proposing this year would eliminate 758 health department positions in the state, though this year\u2019s budget projects no layoffs in Flagler.\nPatrick Johnson, the Flagler County Health Department Administrator for the past 11 years, announced this morning that he\u2019d be retiring at the end of the month\u2014or at least leaving his post in the county for a job at a public health department in North Carolina."}
