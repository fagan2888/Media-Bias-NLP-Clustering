While once upon a time YC was known for legions of social and marketplace apps no one needed, it\u2019s branched out. Now Silicon Valley\u2019s top accelerator features tons of hardware, engineering, alternative energy and enterprise startups, too.\n\n[Update: Check our our list of the \u201cTop 7 startups from YC W\u201916 Demo Day 1\u201d according to investors and TechCrunch\u2019s writers. You can also see all the startups that pitched on day 2 of YC W\u201916 Demo Day here, plus our 8 favorites from that set.]\n\nThe afternoon began with a moment of silence for Andy Grove, former Intel CEO and beloved business mentor, as well as the victims of this morning\u2019s terrorist attacks in Brussels.\n\nThe house at YC\u2019s Demo Day was packed \u2014 more than anyone expected, it would seem. A few chairs short, millionaires from around the world could be seen sitting on the floor to watch startup after startup strut their stuff \u2014 many of them for the first time.\n\nThe big theme of the day was profitability. In the past, YC startups have highlighted their growth, downplaying profitability as some saw it as a sign that they were shooting too small or not reinvesting enough. But due to the market correction, VCs are more keen on startups that can become sustainable faster and won\u2019t need endless funding to succeed. Today, many startups mentioned that they were already profitable, would be in several months, or were in specific markets where you don\u2019t account for money spent trying to expand.\n\nYet Altman told us that investment was \u201chotter\u201d today than he\u2019s ever seen it, with VCs aggressively pushing to invest on the spot. For the last year, he says YC has been telling startups to raise less and get to profitability faster in anticipation of a frosty fundraising climate. Yet now he believes the correction \u201chasn\u2019t trickled down yet\u201d but maybe will by next Demo Day. Altman also mentioned that the $1 billion Cruise self-driving tech acquisition has bolstered investors\u2019 interest in hard-tech companies.\n\nSixty-three companies launched in all today, with 3 of them being noted as \u201coff the record\u201d in advance (that is, they\u2019re a bit too early-days for media coverage; as always, we\u2019ve honored that request). Here\u2019s a look at the 60 we can talk about.\n\nThe companies from Day 1:\n\nNurx \u2013 Uber for birth control:\n\nGetting birth control can be quite difficult \u2014 one needs to have a means of getting to a doctor and be comfortable speaking with a doctor about it. With Nurx, you pick a birth control and one of their doctors writes the prescription and ships it directly.\n\nMagicBus \u2013 Google shuttles for everyone:\n\nCommuting between cities and suburbs can be a pain. MagicBus tries to be the best of both worlds \u2014 affordable and fast. MagicBus vehicles can fit up to 14 people and guarantees riders few stops.

MagicBus says it is growing 50 percent month over month, with 48 percent of riders using the service every day. Read more about MagicBus on TechCrunch here.\n\nPaystack \u2013 Online payments for African businesses:\n\nDespite solid Internet penetration, most payments in the 180 million-person country of Nigeria are done offline. Paystack lets businesses accept payments via credit card, debit card, money transfer and mobile money on their websites or mobile apps. The integration takes just 30 minutes, rather than 3 weeks, and reduces the payment process from 7 steps to 2 steps. Paystack costs businesses $0.50 plus 1.9 percent for local cards and 3.9 percent for international cards. By unlocking online payments, Paystack could help African businesses thrive with the next generation of customers.\n\nTovala \u2013 Smart oven with a companion subscription meal service:\n\nThis is a set-and-forget smart oven that can automatically cook meals \u201cto perfection.\u201d When you put one of their tech-enabled meals into their oven, it knows the exact timing/temperatures required to cook your meal. They also have a subscription plan that sends ready-to-cook meals to your door. They have raised $240,000 on Kickstarter.\n\nRedspread \u2013 Development software:\n\nDowntime costs companies a lot of money \u2014 about $26.5 billion in lost revenue, to be exact. As it turns out, human error is the biggest cause of downtime. That\u2019s where Redspread, which builds collaborative deployment tools, comes in. Redspread launched three weeks ago.\n\nGecko Robotics \u2013 Industrial safety inspections done by robots:\n\nU.S. power plants spend $15 billion a year doing safety inspections of their industrial infrastructure. But these inspections can take seven days, with plants losing $1 million a day in business, and they\u2019re dangerous. Gecko Robotics has designed its own safety inspection robot that can climb walls and do dangerous jobs fast and cheap. For $50,000 to $100,000, it can do a 7-day inspection in just a single day, while collecting more data and not putting lives at risk. Gecko expects to be profitable this year and plans to expand to adjacent industries soon. The startup is driven by a desire to eliminate the tragic stories of safety inspectors falling to their their deaths.\n\nKisan Network \u2013 Marketplace for Indian farmers:\n\nThis is an online marketplace for farmers in India to sell directly to institutional buyers, which the team says is a $200 billion industry.

Outschool is a class marketplace for homeschoolers that offers classes and field trips for kids around topics like anatomy, space and photography. Outschool says it\u2019s on track to sell $14,000 worth of classes per month. (Update: clarified Outschool\u2019s current monthly sales; the wording was previously a bit ambiguous)\n\nCover \u2013 Get insurance by taking a photo:\n\nGetting insurance can be a hassle, but with Cover, you just take a photo of your car, home, pet, jewelry, speedboat or race horses. Right now, Cover farms out these leads to other insurance companies and is collecting $190,000 per month in referrals fees. But next it\u2019s getting licensed to sell insurance directly so it can keep all the commissions, which amount to a $22 billion per year market in the U.S. By making insurance buying mobile, Cover could recruit a new generation of customers focused on convenience.\n\nRappi \u2013 Grocery delivery in Colombia:\n\nRappi aims to be a combination of Instacart and Postmates for Latin America. It charges customers a 70 cent fee for delivery, while paying delivery people roughly $2/hour \u2014 a generous and competitive rate for the area, according to the company\u2019s Latin American founders.\n\nToymail \u2013 Mobile phones built for kids:\n\nNinety-five percent of kids under the age of 10 in the U.S. don\u2019t have cell phones, but parents want to stay in touch with them. They just don\u2019t want kids playing on their phones too much or contacting strangers. So Toymail, which sold $10 million-worth of an alarm clock that runs away from you, has built plush doll toys that are actually phones. Kids can use them to send voice messages to their parents, other family members or friends with Toymail phones. Selling hardware to these kids could be a $3 billion business, but Toymail is planning an app store full of games, stories and educational apps that it will sell, too.

Read more about Stitch on TechCrunch here.\n\nFocal Systems \u2013 Smart shopping carts:\n\nFocal Systems has designed an indoor positioning system that is said to be 14X more accurate than iBeacons and 20X cheaper. The startup retrofits old shopping carts with a camera phone and their positioning system so the carts know where they are in the store. The phone can help shoppers navigate the store and show contextual, targeted ads right as they pass by the advertised product on the shelf. Focal Systems\u2019 demos have shown they can raise revenue by $100,000 per month. The company charges $2,500 per month per store and splits the ad revenue with the store 50/50. It already has a deal lined up with Safeway grocery stores that could bring in $66 million in a year. Walking through brick-and-mortar stores feels stuck in the past. By updating the experience with indoor positioning and screens, it could get easier and much more lucrative for merchants.\n\nSTILT \u2013 Loans for non-US students and working professionals:\n\nAfter coming to the U.S. as educated, legal citizens, Stilt\u2019s founders realized how difficult it was for immigrants to get loans due to a lack of U.S. credit history.

But Revl has addressed the biggest problem with action cameras \u2014 stabilization. It combines physical and digital stabilization to make its footage extra smooth. Revl also offers automatic editing software so you can share your best moments without having to sit down at a computer for boring manual video editing.

WorldCover insures farmers in developing regions; they use satellites to measure rain fall, and pay out automatically based on the rain data.\n\nSOUNDBOKS \u2013 Powerful outdoor battery-powered speakers:\n\nRocking an outdoor party required lots of expensive equipment, technical knowledge and set up time.

Next, it will release a smaller Jambox-sized competitor, and a bigger Elemental line that it claims can power events for thousands of people. Sonos fixed the same problem for wireless indoor audio and became a billion-dollar revenue business. The outdoor audio market is growing 39 percent annually because people love gathering offline with their friends. If SOUNDBOKS can live up to its hype and can blast music all day long on the go, it could capitalize on the shift to the experiential culture.\n\nMailTime \u2013 Lighweight mobile email client world:\n\nEmail sucks.

Castle tracks the behavior of users on its clients\u2019 websites and apps, and can revoke access from those who are acting suspicious. For example, on an e-commerce site, real users might browse several items before adding something to their cart and checking out. But a hacker would add a ton of items and instantly try to check out, but Castle could block them. Castle now has 150 deployments, protects 400,000 users and is growing 35 percent each week. Each new user it protects also teaches it more about the difference between legitimate behavior and the sketchy patterns displayed by hackers.\n\nAcre Designs \u2013 Affordable, modern zero-energy homes:\n\nWe\u2019ve seen very little innovation in the home space, and Acre Designs wants to change that by making it easy to build net-zero homes that produce their own power.

Parking enforcement officers get a tablet they can use to quickly check license plates to see if people have paid through MeterFeeder, and it costs 1/10th of other smart meter systems. And since it gets more people to actually pay for parking rather than risk a ticket, cities earn 30 percent more in parking revenue even as they issue less tickets people hate. MeterFeeder gets a 15 percent cut of all payments, is growing 18 percent per week, now has 3,000 meters in the system and just signed a $1 million annual deal with Pasadena, California.
