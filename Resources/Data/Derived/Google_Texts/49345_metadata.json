You'll see footage of some of the encounters with police and even hear from some of the plaintiffs, in their own words.\n\nThe Northeast Ohio Media Group and The Plain Dealer Publishing Co. have spent weeks examining the lawsuits, combing through public records and interviewing the people who brought the complaints.\n\nThe allegations in the suits are strikingly similar to those highlighted in the Justice Department's 58-page report detailing how Cleveland police routinely use force in ways that violate citizens' rights. The report was based on more than 600 incidents between 2012 and 2013, plus thousands of related documents and hundreds of interviews. | Read Leila Atassi's story\n\nCleveland Mayor Frank Jackson says police use-of-force incidents have declined on his watch\n\nCleveland Mayor Frank Jackson, in a written response to questions regarding the use of excessive force by police, contends that the city aggressively investigates use-of-force cases and that the number of incidents has dropped precipitously on account of policy changes since Jackson took office in 2006.\n\nThe city on Friday posted on its website answers to questions that reporters from Northeast Ohio Media Group and The Plain Dealer Publishing Co. asked as part of a series exploring more than $8 million in settlements and court judgments paid to people who accused officers of unjustifiably shooting, beating, arresting or electrically shocking them. | Read Leila Atassi's story\n\nOne year later, Clevelanders try to avoid United Airlines\n\n", "article_metadata": {"medium": "news", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "boxing-trial, cleveland-clinic, cleveland-police, forcing-change, obamacare, shaker-hit-and-run, top-5-at-5, united-pulling-cleveland-hub, news", "title": "Numerous excessive force suits; United Airlines one year later; Ohio joins Obamacare tax lawsuit: Top 5 at 5", "parsely-page": "{\"title\": \"Numerous excessive force suits; United Airlines one year later; Ohio joins Obamacare tax lawsuit: Top 5 at 5\", \"link\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/top-5/2015/01/numerous_excessive_force_suits.html\", \"image_url\": \"http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/forcing-change/photo/2015/01/26/16859197-standard.jpg\", \"type\": \"post\", \"post_id\": \"15056558\", \"pub_date\": \"2015-01-26T22:00:26Z\", \"author\": \"Ray Jablonski, cleveland.com\", \"tags\": [\"boxing-trial\",\"cleveland-clinic\",\"cleveland-police\",\"forcing-change\",\"obamacare\",\"shaker-hit-and-run\",\"top-5-at-5\",\"united-pulling-cleveland-hub\"] }", "twitter": {"site": "@clevelanddotcom", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/forcing-change/photo/2015/01/26/16859197-standard.jpg", "description": "A summary of some of today's top stories on cleveland.com.", "card": "summary", "title": "Numerous excessive force suits; United Airlines one year later; Ohio joins Obamacare tax lawsuit: Top 5 at 5"}, "article_date_updated": "Monday, January 26, 2015,  5:00 PM", "parsely-metadata": "{\"short_title\": \"\", \"image_url\": \"http://media.cleveland.com/forcing-change/photo/2015/01/26/jacksonwilliamsjpg-818cbdb83e9edfee.jpg\", \"author_name\": \"rfjablon\", \"author_nickname\": \"Ray Jablonski, cleveland.com\", \"author_id\": \"1771\", \"source_blog_name\": \"Top 5 at 5\", \"source_blog_url\": \"http://www.cleveland.com/top-5/\", \"sponsored_content\": \"0\" }", "og": {"site_name": "cleveland.com", "description": "A summary of some of today's top stories on cleveland.com.", "title": "Numerous excessive force suits; United Airlines one year later; Ohio joins Obamacare tax lawsuit: Top 5 at 5", "url": "http://www.cleveland.com/top-5/2015/01/numerous_excessive_force_suits.html", "image": "http://image.cleveland.com/home/cleve-media/width620/img/forcing-change/photo/2015/01/26/16859197-standard.jpg", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"admins": 100000302287435}, "article_publication_name": "cleveland.com", "article": {"author": "http://https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010038038232"}, "article_comments": 0, "article_date_original": "Monday, January 26, 2015,  5:00 PM", "article_author": "Ray Jablonski, cleveland.com", "Description": "A summary of some of today's top stories on cleveland.com."}, "_id": "\"57477af36914bd0286fd4721\"", "article_summary": "| Read Leila Atassi's storyOne year later, Clevelanders try to avoid United Airlines\nBeginning today and for the next two weeks, you'll be able to read stories about the cases on cleveland.com.\nThe report was based on more than 600 incidents between 2012 and 2013, plus thousands of related documents and hundreds of interviews.\nYou'll see footage of some of the encounters with police and even hear from some of the plaintiffs, in their own words.\nThe allegations in the suits are strikingly similar to those highlighted in the Justice Department's 58-page report detailing how Cleveland police routinely use force in ways that violate citizens' rights."}
