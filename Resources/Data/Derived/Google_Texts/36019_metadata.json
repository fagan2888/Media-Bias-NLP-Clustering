Family: Daughter, Ana Huerta On his legacy: \u201cYou can\u2019t assume they\u2019re going to vote for you because you\u2019re a Democrat or a Huerta\u201d On voter apathy: \u201cOur biggest challenge is to motivate people \u2014 get them plugged in. If our apathy allows a Donald Trump to get elected...we all pay the price.\u201d On Daniel Parra: \u201cHad Mr. Parra been able to get traction and appeal, we would be behind him.\u201d On David Valadao: \u201cHe clearly represents ag.

Served in the U.S. Air Force from 1985 to 1987, followed by time in the reserves.

Son, Daniel, 20. Daughter, Danielle, 15. On campaigning: \u201cI\u2019m used to the grind. I\u2019m used to taking it on the chin when things go bad,\u201d Parra said. But he loves connecting with people and talking to them. \u201cI\u2019ve had a great response. Even some of the \u2018Nos\u2019 I convert when I talk to them.\u201d On Democratic voters: \u201cDemocrats cross over to the other side. We\u2019ve got to win them back.\u201d On health care: \u201cI believe in health care for everyone, including the undocumented children. We\u2019ve just got to make sure we keep the president blue \u2014 that\u2019s your only safeguard\u201d against losing the Affordable Care Act. On democracy: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find a way to make sure everybody\u2019s vote counts.\u201d Endorsements: Thanks to his long-standing presence in the race, Parra has collected a good list of endorsements from state, regional and local Democratic leaders and unions. Among the big names are Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, Fresno County Supervisor Henry R. Perea and city council leaders from Arvin, Delano, Shafter, Lemoore, Sanger and Huron.\n\n\u201cWe talk a lot about working people having a chance to get ahead,\u201d said Huerta. \u201cA lot of the families I talk to have kids in college and everyone is working two jobs. A lot of people have lost hope.\u201d\n\nTraveling across the 45 rural communities in the district, he said, he\u2019s been surprised to see how little change and progress has happened in recent years.\n\nWhat the district needs, more than anything, is the economic power to improve their lives and their communities, Huerta said.\n\nThe Republican policies of cutting Medicare and financial aid for children who want to attend college will only harm the future of the 21st District, he said.\n\nHis goal, he said, is to create a broad-based coalition of groups that will pursue other businesses beyond agriculture and oil to power economic progress for families and access to higher education for their children.\n\nBut what the district also needs is political power that can only be built by engaging voters and getting them passionate about change, Huerta said.\n\n\u201cThe race has nothing to do with me at the end of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just another page in the fight for social change in (these) communities.\u201d\n\nParra said his top issues are water, health care for all citizens, immigration reform and public safety.\n\nIn many rural communities, \u201cwater at the tap used to be good. It isn\u2019t any more,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the pumps. I\u2019ll work in a bipartisan way to get those pumps running.\u201d\n\nImmigration reform is personal for him, Parra said. He remembers working in the fields with a couple of relatives and, at the end of the day, growers called immigration authorities on the workers so they didn\u2019t have to pay them.\n\nHis two relatives, who were from Mexico, stood and waited while other workers ran from the immigration officers so they could make sure that Parra \u2014 who was a U.S. citizen \u2014 wouldn\u2019t be rounded up and deported.\n\n\u201cThey took care of me and it\u2019s my job to pay it forward,\u201d Parra said.\n\nAN OUTSIDE PERSPECTIVE\n\nPolitical Science Professor Thomas Holyoke of Fresno State said despite Parra\u2019s long-term presence in the race, Huerta holds the upper-hand going into June\u2019s primary election.\n\n\u201cParra doesn\u2019t seem to have much organization, money or support,\u201d Holyoke said. His support is \u201cpretty isolated in specific parts of the district.\u201d\n\nTo build momentum across the 21st District, he said, Parra needs to really introduce himself to voters in Kern County, where a substantial number of the district\u2019s Democrats reside.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a tall order for a person that doesn\u2019t have a lot of campaign resources,\u201d Holyoke said.\n\nBetween January and March, Huerta raised $142,302. It\u2019s taken Parra nearly a year to raise only $58,883, and most of that money has been spent.\n\nHuerta said he\u2019s confident he\u2019ll make it into the November general election against Valadao. His team is building a network of volunteers designed to get vote-by-mail and poll voters to actually cast their ballot.\n\nBut, no matter who makes it into the general election, they will have a challenging fight against Valadao, Holyoke said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good campaigner. He\u2019s got a good organization,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd, while the Democrats hold a significant 15.5-point voter registration advantage over Republicans in the 21st District, that hasn\u2019t stopped Valadao from steamrolling over poorly funded John Hernandez in 2012 and well-funded, politically connected Amanda Renteria in 2014.\n\nTHE SITTING CONGRESSMAN\n\nValadao\u2019s top issues, he said in an email this past week, remain to \u201csecure a reliable water supply for both families and farmers, achieve comprehensive immigration reform and reduce unnecessary government regulations, which in turn, will lead to real job creation in the valley.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t seem to be treating Parra or Huerta\u2019s candidacies with much worry. He was overseas on a trip to learn about the terrorist threats in the Middle East.\n\nAsked to comment on his opponents, Valadao wrote, \u201cI'm not going to focus on politics. Instead, I'm going to keep doing what I was elected to do: represent my constituents. Rather than discuss potential opponents, we need to prioritize water, strengthening the economy, and protecting Social Security and Medicare for our seniors.\u201d\n\nWhichever Democract faces Valadao in November will need to electrify his voting base, observers say, and they will need to do it without much help.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats have a big enthusiasm problem in the 21st District,\u201d Holyoke said.\n\nWill Donald Trump\u2019s nomination as the Republican presidential candidate, and his promises of mass deportations and a wall along the Mexican border, energize Latino voter registration and turnout?\n\nPaul Mitchell, whose Political Data company provides voter registration data to candidates, has tracked recent statewide trends that show surges in Latino registration that coincide with Trump\u2019s progress toward the nomination.\n\n\u201cI have also seen polling that shows that by a 2:1 margin, Latinos who are registering Democratic are doing so because of someone they are afraid of, rather than candidates they believe in. This would speak to the idea that Trump is actually having the impact of registering more Democratic Latinos than Bernie or Hillary,\u201d Mitchell wrote in an email.\n\nBut Mitchell is not looking at specific districts in his analysis.\n\nHolyoke said he\u2019s not sure how much impact Trump is going to make in the 21st District.\n\n\u201cYeah there is a lot of anger,\u201d he said. But \u201cyou need more than that passion. You have to have a lot of organizational resources\u201d to win.\n\nThe bottom line is that California is not a battleground state for the presidential contest. The state is solidly Democratic.\n\n\u201cThe national parties are not going to contest California, so you\u2019re not going to see a lot of party money here. There is no reason for the national and state parties to be involved in the Central Valley,\u201d Holyoke said. \u201cIf the Democrats are going to beat Valadao, it\u2019s going to have to be with local resources.\u201d", "article_metadata": {"description": "Three men are running for the 21st Congressional District seat this year.
